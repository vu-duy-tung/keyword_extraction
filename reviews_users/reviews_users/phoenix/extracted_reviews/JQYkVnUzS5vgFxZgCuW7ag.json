The food is by far the best Thai in Arizona. It always comes out fresh and hot, and quickly (as quick as possible given that is made fresh!) My favorite item is the yellow curry but I can honestly say that every dish I have tried is amazing! Do yourself a favor and check it out!",

I'm a purist when it comes to Thai food...a good pad thai, a ton of peanut sauce, and some spring rolls are all it takes to make me happy. Luckily I was with a buddy who is a bit more adventurous than me...she had the recommended yellow curry and pronounced it delish!  We met the owner, who is a hoot, and thought the decor was very nice.  The food was great.  I really appreciate the fact that the food meter goes from 1 to 5.  3 was just right for my meal and my buddy went big with 4.  Now, how to get another star:    focus on better service.  The staff was good at keeping our drinks filled but forgot to bring things to the table.....this is a minor quibble for me but may be a dealbreaker for others.  My noodles were also just a tad undercooked  We didn't have condiments at the table  All of these little touches will add weight to your reputatiion!  We both had leftovers to take home and the bill came to a whopping 28 bucks.  We left full and happy.  Great food and good pricing?  Less than a mile from my house? Yes, please!  Can't wait to try it again :)",

This facet is very often over looked in restaurants and we the diner have about a 60/40 chance of arriving to our home with what we actually ordered and all the accompaniments required to enjoy it.  I highly recommend the Panang, it is my favorite Thai dishes and Thai E-San has it on point. Delicious!!!!! We also always get their BBQ chicken dinner which is unique and finger licking good. Then lastly make sure you order the plain sticky rice. Yum! Thai E-San is one of the only Thai Restaurants that have authentic sticky rice for you to enjoy with your entree like in Thailand!!!! The have the sticky rice desert too if that's your thing.  You can't go wrong with any of your choices at Thai E-San. Everything I've had here is wonderful. Don't wait any longer try them tonight you won't be sorry.",

It was perfect with my meal.  This is such a reasonable place, you can enjoy your meal, watch the game, yes, they had the game on tv, have a beer and relax.  The buffet was only $9.50.

Red curry with tofu was also too sweet. Perhaps that's the personal taste/preference of the owners.  I think my other staple Thai restaurants in Central Phoenix were closed for a holiday and Thai E-San was open, I wouldn't mind stopping in, but I don't think I'd make a special trip of it. However, if you like sweeter Thai dishes, Thai E-San might be a good way to go.",

Service was a little unfriendly from one of the servers, who looked like she really didn't want to be there, but that was for one of the visits, so maybe it was an off day. I usually order the pad thai with chicken lunch special when I am here. It's one of the best pad thai dishes I've tried in the area and comes out with a fried wonton, spring roll, soup of the day, and at the end, a slice of watermelon. The interior has a low, dark ceiling, which makes the place seem somewhat small, and every time I've walked in here it smelled like cleaning supplies; but maybe that means they clean the place well at least? Either way, you can't go wrong with the food/price at this place, especially for lunch. I would recommend it for anyone looking to have Thai food.",

    "text": "I'm visiting Arizona and after a long days hike, my peoples and I wanted to find some flavorful carbs to binge on. I yelped and got a long list of thai restaurants. This one stood out due to its reviews on flavor and service.   We arrived around 7 and were quickly greeted and seated. We were a bit complicated since we asked to change tables three times to be more comfortable but were easily accommodated. The waiter was EXCELLENT! I didn't get his name but he was tall and thin and had a very flamboyant attitude. He was prompt, very hospitable, and so resourceful!  The place was dimly lit, with a few string lights, lots of vibrant decor that weren't too distracting and booth seats- each topped with a rose. This was very comforting and they also have television sets for those who don't like to talk during dinner.   We ordered multiple items- most of them extremely spicy. The heat was nice but definitely wasn't good on the stomach afterwards. I think I would sacrifice my stomach again for the goodness though. :) If you're not too fond of the spicy heat, please opt for the lowest number when the waiter asks you. All of the items were full of flavor, not lacking one bit like some Thai restaurants. My peoples and I were highly impressed and were happy to have found a gem blindly in Arizona.   The waiter was the best local tour guide- swear to god. He gave us tips on where to go during certain times for the best views or even shopping. He even provided the weather deets and told us to bring a sweater to stay warm in Sedona- boy was he right! His excitement and interests in our travels was much needed and we felt grateful all around.   Thank you!! We had a great time in Arizona because of this one stop!",

I was alarmed at the price and expressed this, the lady at the counter  me that it would be a large portion.  A friend and I decided to split the meal and let her know that we were intending to do so, I asked if we could have an extra container and she said that wouldn't be possible because they pay 50 cents per container. I suggested that she give me a cheaper styrofoam container  and she considered this, 15 mins later she came up with a paper plate. We waited about 45 mins total for our food and headed back to our meeting. When I opened the bag I saw a tiny container and almost flipped out. Then I began to eat my food and noticed that there were no pineapples. I called them later and told them about what had happened, I argued with the woman who had taken my order for a few minutes on the phone about whether there were pineapples in my order. This was frustrating because I had paid $16 and should have been valued as a customer, not questioned and accused as of lying. Ultimately she let me know that they'd check the cameras and that I could come back in and receive a partial order. I don't think I'll be going back in because I'm not even sure she'll take my word about our conversation, although she has my name and number.",

    "text": "Its 9:15 on a Saturday night in downtown Phoenix and the boyfriend and I are hungry.  Thai food sounds good but one of my biggest issues with Phoenix restaurants is that they close too early.  You are lucky if you can find anything opened past 9pm.  I think I remember that Thai E-San is opened until 10:30 but I am not sure why I think that.    I have never been to this restaurant but I hear good things and have wanted to check it out for a long time.  We get to the restaurant and check the hours. They close at 9:30.  I hate getting a table at the last minute as I don't want to hold up the staff that have been there all day long and know that they want to go home.  I turn around to get back in my car when a nice lady comes out and asks us to come in.  Well, with that warm welcome, how can I refuse?    We get seated in a comfortable window booth and look at the menu.  It is big with the usual menu items that one would expect at a Thai restaurant.  We start with Thai iced tea ($1.99) the perfect drink for a hot Phoenix evening.  We then ordered the chicken Satay ($9.50) Seemed high priced until the dish arrived.  7 large servings of grilled chicken breast perfectly grilled, served with cucumber salad and peanut sauce.  For our main dishes we both were in the mood for curry.  We tried both the Royal Curry, yellow curry in coconut milk, potato, onion and carrot (9.95) and the salmon green curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoot, green beans, Thai eggplant and Thai herbs ($14.95)  Both servings were Tasty, although too large for us to finish but that did not stop us from ordering the Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95)   The service was exceptional as the staff treated us like family.  One warning, if you do not like your dishes spicy, do not order past a one star.",

Wasn't terribly busy for a Wednesday night but they also do a big takeout business.

Spice level was a 4 and was certainly spicy enough. They aren't the biggest portions and I only had 2 shrimp in my combination.  Had they been just a little more generous I would rate 5 stars.

I ordered the beef pad see ew at a 3 spice level. If you like spice then I would start at 3. Personally it was too spicy for me but the food itself was great!

We yelped several recommendations and decided on Thai E- San.   Upon arrival at the restaurant, we were pleasantly greeted and quickly seated.  Our service rep (Aok) was wonderful and extremely helpful in making food suggestions that would suit our palette. So we ordered Tom Yum soup, spicy chicken noodles, basil fried rice, and sweet basil beef.  When I say everything was perfect - it truly was! The flavors and the tongue-tingling experience was incredible from all the authentic Thai flavors.  To top off the experience, the owner came out to visit with all the guests and came by our table to ask about how our service and food were! Awesome touch!  We will definitely be back to Thai E-San when we return to Phoenix.  Please give it a try!",

It was delicious! I finished the whole thing. The shredded papaya with the dried shrimp was the perfect combination (Bangkok Style). My boyfriend didnt want too much soup so he ordered the coconut soup in a smalller serving. It was delicious as well. I couldn't pick which one I liked better - the coconut soup or the shredded papaya salad. Just like most thai cuisine, the standards for spiciness are a lot higher so take note when picking your spicy level. For my main entree, I ordered the thai bbq with jasmine rice. I was not a fan of this one for some reason. I guess I prefer my bbq chicken a lot crispier and somewhat charred? They give you a huge serving of this one, about 3-4 pieces of chicken.   The service was good and the vibe was great. Definitely reminded me of my visit in Bangkok a few years back. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "My first experience with Thai food was eating in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant back in my hometown run by a Thai woman who would never let anyone come through her kitchen doors and who was famous for her tantrums which would close down the shop unexpectedly.  The sole waiter was the Thai woman's husband who met her when he was abroad in the military back in the day, a grizzly old white guy who told horrible jokes.  The restaurant did very well despite the sometimes spotty closing hours.  Needless to say, my expectations for Thai food are very high.  I've been searching around different cities trying to find Thai food as good as the food from my first experience and have been disappointed until I tried Thai E-San.  I don't know what it is, but there's something special about the aftertaste at Thai E-San that sticks with you.  This is excellent Thai food.  We had the 3-star spicy Pa-Naeng Curry with Duck and the Red Curry with Shrimp.  Both were spectacular and had the perfect combination of spice and flavor.  Portions were big enough for at least two meals or for two people to share, which is how Thai food should be - it often taste even better the second day.  Although we did take-out, the service was very friendly, and the smell... the smell inside this restaurant made me want to sit down and just sniff.  I've definitely found my new Thai place.",

The 5/5 here is the same as a 5/10 at any of the legit thai places I've been to (where 10/10 is pet pet and 12/10 would be pet mak). A 5/5 is spicier than hot cheetos, but maybe not as spicy as the XXTRA hot cheetos.  Usually at these sorts of places, I get a 6 or 7, so I just put a few spoonfuls of chili oil to give it an edge (it has roughly the same amount of spiciness as the standard thai chili).",

    "text": "We stopped by this location for mother's day dinner  thinking we would have a great experience from the 4 stars OMG I was completely wrong! After my fiance spent $60 on dinner  the customer service was unprofessional, crappy and extremely long! We waited a whole hour for our meal in this small restaurant with hardly any customers if anything people were leaving because they were screwing up other meals. I was disappointed that the waiter got my fiance meal wrong  3 times. By the 3rd time I was expecting them to  give my fiances meal for FREE. The manager  said she tasted his food before serving it to him to see how spicy it was and then gave him the left  overs. I thought WTF that's DISGUSTING we don't know if the woman gas a disease in her mouth!  When we started complaining  the old lady then started criticizing my 12 year old son saying he looked  like a girl from his hair cut. My son is just about bald and the only little girls I know of that dont have hair or have very short hair are little girls with cancer! Either the lady is completely blind or just stupid! I confronted the old lady who is also the manager about calling my son a girl how she shouldn't be saying that to kids my son even confronted her saying it really made him sad! The lady had NO REMORSE I had to tell her to apologize because she didn't want to.  I  thought my son deserved a FREE meal after all that crap but no she only gave $6 off of $60 Talk about PAYING FOR A  RUDE ASS MOTHER'S DAY DINNER!  All week long I've been telling my son he doesn't look like a girl   because he believes what the manager said! I  really want this restaurant to refund all the  money my fiance spent there! My advice Do not bother stopping into this restaurant just to pay to be criticized and have the old lady eat off of every dish they serve that's disgusting!",

    "text": "Update: I received a very respectful message from the owner (or some relation, I presume) expressing condolences for my experience. I realize that experiences may differ, but it is your right as a consumer to know my first impressions and weigh them against the overwhelmingly supportive reviews. That is why the rating and review will otherwise remain unaltered.  In short, the food was not good. The service is some ways was acceptable and in other ways abysmal. The staff seemed happy at least.   I went here with my wife and my parents because we wanted Thai food, and this place has among the highest ratings for Thai food in the valley. We drove all the way from Rural and Broadway. My parents came from Mesa.   All of the people who prescribed a five star rating, I'm calling you out. Yelp has consistently lead me to awesome new finds. I even chose my attorney through Yelp. Of course, there is always some expectation of differing opinions from reviews: some better, some worse. This place, however, was way off target. I'm not going to try to estimate wait times, but the whole course of the meal ran about two hours with just an app and an entree. We ordered an appetizer first thing, which the wait staff had to be reminded about. Every time we would try to say something to one of them, they would listen until they got that one thing, and then scurry off before we could mention anything else, which resulted in a lot of subsequent back and forth trips.   My wife ordered tequila, which I know is not Thai, but they offered it. When it was brought out, they were really weird about it. The server asked her to taste it to make sure it was alright. They were very mysterious about what brand it was.  They did not have limes at the restaurant, which is bizarre for a place that people want to call \"authentic\" or \"legit\" Thai food.   My wife and I both asked for 4/5 spiciness. We were not impressed. Thailand makes some of the spiciest dishes in the known world, but my dish ranked on par with Tapatio hot sauce. Obviously, when you go to a Thai restaurant, there is an understanding that people who are not Thai probably should not be unwittingly exposed to the native level of full spiciness, but we're not babies.   They dropped a lot of bowls while we were there, which we agreed was probably the reason that the bowls are plastic.   They were stingy about how much rice we got. I think I would call my portion about one cup. It did not seem to have been made recently. The entree portions were fine, but my meal didn't seem particularly fresh.   They were very prompt (minus a little confusion) about refilling our drinks. That is a plus that even good restaurants fail to live up to, so bravo.  The people there seemed happy, and I liked the matching but not identical elephant shirts the staff wore.   Not sure what people are saying about the \"atmosphere,\" it was just some big tv's and a bunch of mish-mashed nic-nacs: the usual strip mall Asian cuisine furnishings. It wasn't too noisy or anything. Generally was disappointed not so much because of the place itself, but because of my artificially inflated expectations.",

This is for a reason - the peanut sauce is unique and delicious; it is the best I have ever had. It is very thick and spiced nicely.  Coupled with the broccoli chicken I was in heaven for lunch! The price point is amazing for such gourmet Thai. My lunch was punctuated with a slice of watermelon too - nice touch for the summer.

She states that she didn't know that it would upset me so - I had to forgive her and move on. It was a genuine apology and I still love her.... Yes, that's how I feel with Thai E-San.   They messed up, but they didn't know until I posted that review. The owner reached out to me and invited me to the restaurant on her. She told me she researched what was wrong with the noodles and it's because the manufacturer of the noodles changed the texture/ingredients so when you cook it, it turns into mush. She had to change the way they cooked the noodle dish to make it back to the greatness I remember it being. She also discussed the service and she has made changes to improve.   She apologized and thanked me for posting the review. She said that she deals with negative reviews seriously and she takes it as constructive criticism to improve. Bravo, Pui (the owner)! Now, that's a great restaurant owner!  We came the other night and we were served the two dishes we always get: Shrimp Pad Se-Ew and Beef Panang - both were deliciously fabulous! The service was great and the owner was so sweet and hopes that we come back.   So moral of the story - The owner apologized, it was genuine, and she took proper steps to improve. Like my sister, I have to forgive and move on because I still love Thai E-San.  Duh, I will dine at this establishment again and again and again.",

The owner is always there and is so friendly and absolutely devoted to great customer service. The staff is friendly and the environment is great! The have sweet and sour on the table (some places are stingy with this and I love sweet and sour sauce) and fill water glasses frequently (a necessity when you order your food Thai hot). The portions are large and I usually leave with leftovers. I usually get the stir fried mixed vegetables with chicken and my husband loves the chicken red curry. The fried spring rolls are to die for! I highly recommend this Thai food and the service here.",

IT WAS DELISH!  We ordered the Nam Sod pork salad with lime, which was a bit chewy but with the extra peanut sauce made it was just right, & we also needed more lettuce cups since it only came with 2 small pieces.   The stir fry eggplant w/ tofu was tasty  The wedges of eggplant were the perfect texture & sauteed perfectly.  My boo gave it a 10!  The Green curry Salmon w/ green bell pepper was one of the best curries we've tasted but the Salmon was a bit overcooked.  The coconut ice cream freshly made from coconut cream served w/ ground peanuts is divine! Same room for that for sure!!",

We both agreed that the spice level was perfect. We are both total wimps so we got 1's out of a 1-5 spiciness range. It was perfect, a little kick without being too hot. The tofu was crispy and yummy without being too chewy. We both loved how creamy the broth was and how it was loaded with vegetables. Also one of the most affordable meals we've had in a while.

Whenever I arrive for pick-up, there's always a line, the phone is always ringing off the hook, but I never have to wait more than 5 minutes for my food. That line moves quick, orders get taken, and my food comes out hot and fresh. Not only that but everyone is so friendly too. Food is never served with a grunt.  \"Waka Flocka Flame\" provides two meanings. First, that food fire. Heavy hand with the heavy heat. For curry, I can do that Thai-spicy bc the coconut milk in the curry acts as a blessed life raft amid the sea of flocka flames. But when I go pad thai, there's no raft. You gotta be the Michael Phelps of Spice in order to swim out that tsunami or itll fold you like origami. As such, I can only go 4 (on their 1-5 spice scale) in that dish. But you know what, guys? I've never had a new years resolution before. So why not now? I'm doing this. I am going to work my way up to Thai-spicy by the end of this year. THIS. YEAR.  FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS   (I know I said \"Waka Flocka Flame\" had two meanings and only really explained the first. I got too carried away with my spontaneous news years resolution, but the second meaning is basically that repetitive FIVE STARS line, except it would have been more eloquently articulated and there probably would have been another Phelps-reference)",

Lunch comes with the soup of the day, a veggie roll, wonton chips, your entree, and a watermelon slice for desert- all for under $10 unless you want the seafood option.  The only complaints I have (though they aren't really complaints, just pain points) are that the parking lot is crammed and the place looks not so nice on the outside, but once you find a parking spot and walk in the restaurant is gorgeous!

It was spot on, including the wide, soft rice noodles stir fries with seasonings over which to pour the beef and broccoli gravy. Perfect with the fermented soy beans in the mix. Looking forward to going back to try more dishes!",

Okay fair warning it is in a sketchy part of town but you can't rate the food based on location & it's just your loss if you do!! When you walk in it's actually a quaint & cozy place that definitely takes pride in their restaurant, you have your choice of table or booth which all are set up with their place settings. We were greeted by our super friendly & very energetic server Bobby, who's from Thailand but has an easy to remember American name, we couldn't have been happier with the service that he gave us. We started with the potstickers & the crab puffs, both were cooked perfectly without being overdone. For our entrees my hubby chose the half BBQ chicken which he said was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning. I chose the snow pea pod stir fry with mixed seafood & a spice level of 3, it came with two large shrimp, four mussels, calamari & a scallop, all were cooked perfectly, it was a large portion, therefore lunch for the following day!! We'll definitely be going back, can't wait!!",

There is no shortage of great flavor in Thai E-San's food though.   It's a lovely restaurant. Very nice Thai decor. They have several tables and booths to choose from.   Any time I am at a Thai restaurant, my drink of choice is the Thai iced tea. This one did not disappoint!  Highly recommended!   To eat, we started off with the Thai toast appetizer. It was a huge portion of little toast squares that are topped with a meat mixture and then coated in egg batter and fried. Served with a sweet cucumber and onion sauce. Absolutely delicious.   For my main course I had the spicy basil noodles and added chicken for my protein. I ate every bit of it. My two friends ordered tofu panang curry and pad Thai. All of our choices were delicious.   The owner of Thai E-San is a very sweet woman. She walks around chatting with her customers and makes sure everyone is happy. Nice touch!  Enjoy!",

Atmosphere:   Super casual. There are a couple TVs inside that had sports on, and there is a sign outside that states \"Wi fi.\"     Service:   The wait staff were incredibly friendly and nice. They also were not annoying at all and did not rush us.    Food:  The soup is what I test Thai restaurants with. The lemongrass vegetable soup was delicious, spicy and hot.  I asked for medium spicy and that's exactly the spice I got!  I also ordered sticky rice, and it was as it should be.  The guy I was with got some kind of pork curry and said it was perfect.  He was able to get brown rice with this.    Drinks: I had water and jasmine tea.  The jasmine tea was hot and appropriately flavored.",

The staff are really friendly and put some Thai hot together for me and took great pride doing so. It seems family owned just by the feel and hospitality, I may be wrong but that would be my guess.   The green curry here is my favourite. Lots of flavour and spice... if you can't handle heat I would keep the spice to 2 from the 5 levels. If you are like myself and like the spicey then 3 and above is great.   One thing that is a must is the Tom Ka soup. It's the best, so much flavour... coconut, lime, chicken at a level 3. Very satisfying.  I will be back soon to try some of the Panang. I'm sure I will not be disappointed.",

We stopped in to Thai E-San and perused the menu, both electing for the safe choice of Pad Thai.  We returned home, cocktails full and settled in with forks and empty stomachs, writhing in anticipation of the delicious smells...  Thats where the good things ended.  The fresh eggrolls were overloaded with mint, and the pad thai noodles where way over cooked into a mushy mess.  Guess we'll have to stick with cherry blossom for our pad thai cravings from now on.",

I highly recommend it as I have come to adore the staff and owners.  Lunch specials are a great deal @7.95 and they come with everything and I usually take some home with me even.

I was able to call my order in, and it was ready about 15 minutes later. It's in what used to be the Big Wong Chinese restaurant, but they've made some nice changes inside. The decor was very nice and inviting, and I was promptly greeted by a super cheerful lady all ready with my check. I ordered the  Pad Thai Lunch Special with chicken and Shrimp. I ordered it with two stars for the level of spice, just to be safe. the lunch special came with a humongous bowl of soup, a spring roll and a humongous heap of Pad Thai. I started with the soup, which I found a bit off putting (but I'm not much of a soup guy, maybe my wife would llke it better?) Next I dove into the spring roll. Not very good in my opinion, but that could just be my taste. I wasn't a fan of the texture, and there wasn't much flavor in the spring rol. The pad thai was pretty good, I've definitely had better. Will I go back? Heck yeah I will. I only tried the one dish, and it was pretty good. Next time maybe I'll  try one of the many curries they have on the menu. All in all, I shelled out 7 bucks for lunch for myself and what will most definitely by lunch for my wife tomorrow.",

I would personally rather pay an extra dollar to get high quality.  The pad thai is excellent, one of the best I have had. It's suprising how many thai restaurants cannot make a good version of this basic dish. Add a little chili sauce to give it a great kick. The red curry is a little different than most places, but very good and very fresh. The same goes for the chicken coconut soup. It's delicious.  I agree that the large tables are a little big for a twosome, and the service is a little off.  I think the service will improve with time.  I have eaten at thai restaurants around the world and I think the food here is excellent. Very fresh and authentic. Give it a try.  UPDATE: They have lowered their prices a bit, and they are now very competitive. Most of the lunches are $6.49, which includes soup and eggroll. A great deal for excellent food.",

The music was soothing and appropriate, but the food left something to be desired.  We started with the pork satay.  The pork was very good and perfectly cooked.  But the peanut sauce was bland and chalky.  I couldn't taste the peanut.  For our entree we ordered the Panang; Chicken with carrots in coconut milk and peanut sauce.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't like the spice that makes your food taste like lemon cleaning fluid.  Is it ginger? I don't know really.  But the Panang had a lot of it and that was all I could taste.  The service was good and the other patrons seemed to enjoy their meals, so to be fair, I would have to reserve judgment on Thai E-San until I've tried a few other things on their menu.  The problem is, we really like Thai Lahna and they aren't much further away.",

The portions are a good size and their prices are reasonable, especially considering the excellent quality of their food.    And as a vegetarian I have to say that they know how to cook tofu and don't skimp on it in their dishes. And the variety of options here for vegetarians is very good. The tofu satay is a must.  Their vegetarian Pad Thai and Massaman Curry are 2 of our favorite dishes.  Everything we've tried has been delicious!",

Have been here several times over the past year and a half, and have never had a bad dish.  Clean establishment, great selection, and the food is FAST.  The owner is incredibly friendly, always walking around to check in on guests, and see how their meal is.  My only problem is that I don't live closer to here, otherwise I'd be here every week!",

We were fans of Thai Basil, but one night they were not answering the phone for a to go order, we drove over and it was closed on a Tuesday early eve? Online it even said they were open. So not sure what happened, but we ended up trying Thai E San. What a charming and cozy place inside! Clean, great display of food also when they bring it out, down to the dishes. Great date place, great atmosphere, very attentive service and polite, The food was great! We have already been back, if it weren't for Thai Basil being closed that night we probably wouldn't have stopped in! So glad we did! Its our new fave place!",

Entrees:  2 BBQ chickens; green curry with beef; 2 tom guy soups; pork fried rice, pineapple fried rice, pad saw yee noodles, pad thai noodles, and green beans with pork.  The BBQ chickens were good but dry (need to apply the sweet chili sauce).  The tom guy soup were mild (but my mouth was on FIRE).  Everything else was GOOD!!  Everyone took a leftovers for lunch!",

Making a big move to an entirely different city is always scary, but to leave behind your favorite restaurants? That's a different story. A short walk down from my place reminds me of where I came from.  It doesn't get more wholesome than this! This is delicious thai food! The Massaman Curry with chicken is amazing! Honestly, anything in the Massaman Curry is a great choice! The curry is so smooth and the peanut sauce makes it so creamy. The crab puffs are so good! They are filled with crab meat, which is unusual to find in the landlocked state of Arizona.  I am happy to have found this amazing thai restaurant a walk away from my apartment. I moved in a month ago, I've already had take out more times than I can count! If this wasn't so close to where I live, I'd starve! I suggest this restaurant to anyone and everyone! Go in, you won't regret it!",

We were pleasantly surprised! It is better than Thai Elephant and Thai Basil. Definitely more authentic and more flavorful. We are picky and eat out frequently- so it's saying a lot that we loved this place.  We tried the hot and sour soup with beef, the silver noodle soup, and the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were literally the best either of us had ever had. My soup was probably one of the best I've had (hot and sour) with WAY more flavor than most places. My boyfriend said his silver noodle soup reminded him of an authentic dish his filipino mother used to make.   Also, the staff was super friendly in that we-are-all-family-and-we-welcome-you-with-open-arms kind of way. The lady at the front was also hilarious. She and our waiter checked on us several times and were very good about explaining the dishes.   Last- the Thai iced was great and the place was beautiful.  Yes- the tables are rather large and a bit awkward, but it was no big deal.   Also, the food did take awhile but this is a small shop with authentic recipes that were well worth the wait.   We will be back!",

I came here with a few friends after visiting a museum and boy the food was pretty good. The menu selections are for the most part traditional Thai choices ranging from curries to steamed fish. For the appetizer, I decided to get the Fresh Spring Rolls and those were great, I wish that there was a bit more shrimp in it however. After that, I ordered the Royal Curry at a 3 out of 5 spiciness and that was really good. They nailed the balance of heat with the coconut milk based curry and while it was hot, it tasted great as well! The staff is friendly and I would recommend this place to people who want to taste a more traditional style of Thai curry.",

    "text": "A friend and I were meeting up for lunch and the original plan was to go to a different Thai place we'd been to before.  Unfortunately that place didn't open until 5:00 and we met up at 3:00...fail.  Luckily I used my handy-dandy Yelp app to find other Thai places within a nearby radius and Thai E-San was the closest one and had a decent rating.  It's definitely a pretty nondescript building but I figured that a lot of the time those are the hidden gems that most people don't give a chance to.  We walked in and someone was already waiting with menus (I'm assuming he saw us pull up through the windows) and took us to a table right away.  There was only one other group in the restaurant but it was a little late for normal lunch and early for dinner so I wasn't surprised.  It worked out nicely for us though as our waitress was able to check on us frequently and made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed.  The menu is HUUUUGE!!  There are at least 70+ items to choose from so it's a little overwhelming at first and if you're indecisive like me it's quite the task picking just one thing!  I ended up going with the Spicy Fried Rice with Basil with Beef as the meat.  I also ordered the Thai Egg Rolls.  My friend got something with Silver Noodles, I can't remember what it was listed as on the menu.  The egg rolls came out nice and hot and crispy, flavor was good and I love that they have the sweet and sour sauce in bottles on the table so you can apply it as you like.  The main dishes came out not to long after and portions were very generous.  I ate more than I probably should have because it was so good and it looked like I'd barely touched my plate.  Even my friend who is 6'8\" couldn't finish his plate.  We both concluded that we were happy the other Thai place was closed as this one had a bigger selection and bigger portions so it seems like it was meant to be!",

The owner, Pui, is very nice and visited our table to unsure everything was going well.  She recommended the sticky rice with mango and home made coconut ice cream if we were interested in dessert.    All of the the food was very good and I will definitely be back when in Phoenix.  I recommend it and hope that people frequent it enough so that it is around for a long time.     We had Pad Thai, Beef Salad, Chicken with Snow Peas (ordered for someone who doesn't care too much for Thai spices), Creamy Chicken, Stir Fried Eggplant with Tofu, Pineapple Fried Rice, and the mango with sticky rice and coconut ice cream (also comes with something very similar to banana lumpia).  All was very good and can make it as spicy or not as spicy as you like.  This placed open in January 2011; therefore, I'm not sure if the old reviews that brought down the overall rating really apply to this place.    Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.  This place should have an average of 4 stars not 3.",

    "text": "I wish Big Wong is still here... but instead its Thai ESan.  After my bad experience at Thai Lhana I thought I would redeem the Thai cuisine by checking this place out for dinner. The parking lot look busy but when I got inside, there were maybe 5 couples seated. There were only 2 servers so we waited a bit before being seated.  The place was scary quiet, library quiet. I couldn't figure out but then I had an AH-HA moment... the tables were GINORMOUS. I felt small sitting in the chair and the round marble tables normally seat 6-8 but are used for couples. Everyone was seated so far away, screaming would have been a good conversation level.   The two servers seemed pretty busy so it was a while before we were able to put in our drink orders. We both ordered an iced thai mil tea which was good, standard.   We ordered a Thai Sampler Appetizer: wontons, fish cake, chicken satay, egg rolls and Thai Toast, pad thai and red curry (spice level 4 of 5).  It was about 45 min before our appetizer made its way out. I would normally be understanding if they were busy but there were only 5 other couples in there... and its just a plate of deep fried goodies. I think that should have taken 10 mins.  The egg rolls were probably the best. The wontons needed more filling, I pretty much ate deep fried wonton skins. The fish cakes were good but overwhelmingly seasoned with lemongrass. It was almost too much to eat. The chicken satay were alright, a bit dry from the grill. The Thai Toast is battered tofu and deep fried, of course... would have been better if I had some maple syrup. It was deep fried beyond recognition.  The pad thai noodles were mush. The noodles were overcooked and just stuck together in a huge ball and was hard to separate. And while I wanted to taste it, I honestly believe Thai ESan cooks season all their dishes with a huge heap of chili powder. Every part of the noodle was covered in the chili powder. I'm actually still flossing out chili flakes from my teeth. It was too hot to even enjoy.  The red curry was good. I liked the coconut flavor and fresh basil. Never had curry with green beans and bamboo shoots before but it was good. Also another dish with a generous heap of chili powder added to it. I couldn't have anymore because my lips were on fire.   I know Thai food is spicy but damn... let me taste the other flavors too. All I tasted was HOT. I couldn't finish the curry or the noodles. I thought Thai ESan would convince me that Thai food was amazing again but it was too hot to handle.. and not in a good way either.",

I went for 3 since I had not tried their food before and am cautious of Thai opinions on spicy. Next time I will try 4 since it was not as spicy at that level as some other places I frequent.  Service was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant was busy but we got a table quickly and several people came over during the meal to ask if everything was good. I will definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

I highly recommend the basil catfish, the eggplant tofu curry, pad ce ew, and the mussamun curry. As an added bonus, when you ask for your food hot or Thai hot, you don't see lashings of ground chili strewn across the top of your meal, but, rather, the extra chili is cooked with the food, giving a much more satisfying experience.  In sum, go to Thai Esan, order a Singha (or three), a pad ce ew Thai hot, and enjoy your evening.",

    "text": "I'm a little confused by the super high rating of Thai E-San. The dishes I had here weren't bad, but I've found other Thai places in Phoenix that far outstrip the fare here and often at more generous prices.   The restaurant itself is located in a small lot off a busy street, and the parking lot has very slanted parking spaces. The interior decor sports an interesting mix of wooden tables and red plastic leather booth chairs. The ambiance was definitely casual. Service was fine, a little slow but friendly.   I do like the variety of spices and sauces available on each table, and I was a huge fan of the jalapenos in vinegar that helped to cut the heaviness of the dishes I tried. That particular sauce was also incredibly salty, but it was flavorful enough that I didn't mind that as much.  Pad Thai: This was so sweet that I was grateful for the very salty sauce I mentioned above. The noodles were drenched in sauce, which I like, but the sweetness made me not want to take more than a few bites before dousing the next few in salty sauce. The portion was generous, and the shrimp were nicely tossed so that they weren't overcooked.   Pad See Ew: I liked this dish better than the Pad Thai, as it was much better balanced. The soy sauce was flavorful without being too salty, and I detected more of the wok-fired fragrance I love in these kinds of sauteed noodle dishes. The beef was a bit stringy and tough, possibly because it hadn't been tenderized before sauteeing, but I didn't mind it too much since the flavor was pretty good.  With so many other amazing Thai places in the Phoenix area, it's unlikely that I'd return to Thai E-San. I'm glad that so many others find this place amazing, but I personally found it just a-okay.",

The Pad See Ew was pretty good and grew on me over the course of dinner (at first I didn't like it as much), but it wasn't one of the best I have had in AZ, so I would rate it a 4--the fish sauce smell was a bit strong.  The egg rolls were some of the better ones I have tried, with chicken instead of pork, but slightly oily. I would rate them 4-4.5.   The Thai Iced Tea was excellent and I would rate it a 5.  Overall, the quality of the food, the service and the prices were all excellent, so I would probably rate the restaurant a 4.5 overall. At first, I was going to give the restaurant a 4 based on my entre, but since I can't give it a 4.5 and everything was excellent, I'll give them a 5 for now and I'll try a curry next time to see if it desves it. Based on the reviews and lovely smells, I think it probably would.",

    "text": "Every now and then I get severe Thai food cravings. Thankfully Yelp has always steered me in the right direction!  Hubby and I came here around 3 pm for an early dinner and the place was already more than halfway full. When we got our food, we could see why.   Here's a dish by dish breakdown:   - Pineapple fried rice: 4.5/5. Contains chicken, shrimp, and cashews. Very unique flavor, with earthy undertones from the cashew that really livens up the citrusy bursts of pineapple. Only 2 shrimps in the whole dish, but plenty of chicken.   - House pad thai: 4/5. A little sweeter than I prefer, but still well executed overall. Heavier on the sauce but not too greasy. Also comes with mostly chicken and 2 shrimps. Looks a lot redder than in photos.   - Fish cakes appetizer: 3.5/5. Comes with 5 deep fried pieces and a dipping sauce. Quite flavorful but couldn't taste any fish.   Prices are reasonable.  2 entrees, 1 app, and 1 drink came out to about $40 with tax.   Service was decent and prompt; food came out within 15 min.   Ambience is casual with a more traditional looking interior - red and gold colored decor, paper parasols decorating one wall. There are two widescreen TVs tuned into ESPN which was nice. It's not a large space but not too small either - can accommodate parties of any size.   Private parking lot out front with a sign for more spaces in the back.  Long story short, this definitely satisfied my Thai food craving and I'd recommend trying it out at least once!",

Even though it was just $1.00, that alone would probably discourage us from wanting to return. It's sort of like a restaurant giving you bread but charging you for butter.",

We started with the tofu appetizer and it was served lightly fried and extremely hot. We ordered a side of peanut sauce, but as it turned out the chili sauce that accompanied the tofu was actually better. I ordered the green curry with beef and was very satisfied with it. I like a medium amount of spice, but I asked for mild because Thai food tends to be 10x spicier than any other type of food. I'm glad I did because the mild was plenty spicy enough. I wasn't fond of the beef in the curry dish, next time I'll opt for vegetarian or tofu instead. My guest is a picky eater and she ordered the pineapple friend rice with cashews and seemed to like it as well. I'm pretty sure it was mixed with a yellow curry powder, so beware picky eaters! All in all very good Thai food and I'd definitely return and recommend this place. The food was piping hot and served fresh from the kitchen!",

    "text": "Craving Thai food when I landed back in phoenix after a work trip. Been to a few before and wanted to try something different. Found this spot and the greeting were friendly. Thai egg rolls and papaya salad with crab to start. Both were good. House pad Thai for the hubby and he was very pleased as it had shrimp and other meats in it instead of just one. I had the veggie red curry and it was very flavorful. Love the bamboo. The playing was beautiful and the interior was authentic. I feel like we found our new go to Thai restaurant close to home. Definitely will be back again! I want to try some of the soups as they looked really good but I had no more room for them this trip. Thanks for the great service! Prices were very fair as well. Great find for us.",

Our server was friendly and welcoming. I ordered the pad thai with vegetables and tofu and added eggs. I got a 4/5 spice level and it was hott (extra t for emphasis.) I ended up taking most of it home because I got caught up in storytelling and good conversation. As leftovers, the main differences was the texture of the noodles got softer/mushier and it wasn't as spicy, but the flavor remained tasty. The Thai iced tea was on the sweeter side, maybe too much condensed milk. Could always be improved with some boba. I'd like to come back and try other dishes as they have many to choose from!",

I ordered the spicy basil noodle but I got it without noodle and add in tofu. It was delicious! The Thai tea is really good as well.   This place has really good customer service as well. People here are nice and friendly. They are doing a promo where if you write a review on yelp, you get free coconut ice cream.   This place deserves 5 stars.

I cannot believe the person in charge had the nerves to tell me that It could have not been possible as city just certified them and cleared them. Maybe the rats were hidden while they were being inspected. 3 people saw the rat, and one of us felt it as it ran touching a foot. This is pretty disgusting, pest control should be called often.

Ordered the Chicken Larb ( it comes with lettuce, but life hack here if you can get your hands on cabbage wraps=mind blown ). Also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu. Crazy goodness here folks.

    "text": "Thai E-San is not as authentic as it gets. I really enjoyed the customer service and the setting of the restaurant. Right off the corner of 7th Avenue and Indian School Road this little restaurant is great for a first Thai experience, however if you're a person who enjoys drinking a soft beverage with their favorite Thai dishes, I would consider the fact that they charge the drink per can. For $1.50 more you can get another can of your favorite soft drink that's if your budget permits to three to five dollars worth of drinks.   The Thai food is as simple as it gets, the portions are sizable and to ones surprise enough for one to take home! On the tough side, the vegetables to meat/noodle/rice ratio is somewhat uneven, the flavors of egg in most dishes is over powering taking one back to the feeling of breakfast or a less enticing egg sandwich flavor. Over all the food is acceptable but don't hope for high end flavors that take you back to an out of country feel.   This quiet and relaxing restaurant is very clean and professional, however the constant reminder of the news channel is unnecessary. Let's keep politics out of the table. On the other hand, as one person that doesn't know how Thai food is made, I have experienced other variations of authentic Thai food and this restaurant does not equal to my satisfaction.

We got the tom Kha non spicy since my mom cannot eat spicy but was perfect since they have chili sauce that can be added on the side for those who love some kick! The rad nah tasted perfect as well! As for their papaya salad it was tooooooo salty for me, and my friend agreed as well. I tried a little of my sisters red curry and it was seasoned well! Had a nice sweetness to it, as well as a nice kick!   And of course to end the meal with some mango sticky rice! Small portion for one person, but if you have a doggy bag then it can be shared with 2 people. I made sure to ask the waitress in the beginning if they had it available since usually most restaurants don't have it since it's not in season so I made sure I saved room for that yummy goodness! =)",

When it was brought to the managers attention, she said she couldn't do anything about it.  Essentially, my daughters dinner was paid for 3 times.  Super upset right now as I feel they wouldn't help because she is young.  My daughter will file a complaint with her bank.",

I actually like the traditional formal-style Thai dining tables, although a lot of people complain about the awkwardness of it. Distrurbing kelly green wall with faux-finish really ruined the ambience.  Service was reasonable. Quick, not overbearing. I had multiple questions about things that were not on their menu (roti, other desserts) and the owner came over to the table to chat.   Food was... alright. But not good enough. They market themself as Isaan-style food, which I personally know quite a bit about. They were heavy-handed on the fish sauce and light on spice. Anyone who knows Isaan will tell you that if you ask for it hot, expect to be nauseated by the spicyness. I asked for Thai-hot on my curry and tom yum goong; the curry was not even remotely spicy and the soup was slightly spicy. I am disappointed!   Drinks were alright. PRICY beers... my god. I paid $4.50 for a Singha bottle :( Thai iced tea was great.   Not worthy of the Isaan designation. Maybe if you're desperate like I was, you'll have a one-night-stand but eventually go back to a place that is more delicious, less expensive and generally more worthwhile.",

The broth was spicy and rich and flavorful with lots of mushrooms. The six shrimp were large, plump and juicy. Too many restaurants overcook these little guys, but not Thai E-San. Word to the wise:  order a couple of sides of rice to add to the soup. That's the way the natives do it. And the rice soaks up all the goodness of the broth.   We also had the chicken larb. It was quite tasty, the chicken just cooked so it was juicy and flavorful. The dressing was minty and spicy. Wow, just, wow.  Between the soup and larb (I think it's on the salad listing), we had a full meal and left quite happy.",

It was sweet, sour and spicey and I didn't mind the tofu at all! I got the pad thai noodles \"medium\" spicey.... wooohooo, the medium spicey cleared my sinuses! It was on the little spicey side for me, but flavorful enough for me to keep taking another bite! The meal ended with a few slices of watermelon, which was perfect to cool my lips and mouth with.

The fish patties were the best.  I had ordered the BBQ chicken since last time they were out.  The chicken was too dried and salty for me.  I have better BBQ chickens at other Thai places.  As for the service, they still need work on it.  At first the waitress attended to our large group, but when it was time to pay, somehow she seems not to like us.  Maybe, it was the coupon I gave her for the wine after the bill came.  I showed her the coupon before ordering so she knows to discount the bill.  Of course, she forgets to discount it.  It took at least 15 to 20 minutes for them to recalculate the bill for us.  The kiddies were getting a little loud.  I had the feeling that they wanted to kick us out.  When we walked out, there was no Thank you or Goodbye.  I'm still a fan of food not the service. I am dropping a star for their service.",

    "text": "Definitely the prettiest Thai restaurant!  I walked in to meet with one of my favorite girls, Ayesha S., and saw her sitting at a HUGE table.  Huge.  For two of us.  It was a big, round, marble monstrosity but very stylish.   We started out with the spring rolls with shrimp.  They came out and they were gigantic!  That must be the theme here.  Definitely fresh ingredients and nothing in it was overdone.   Service was a little spotty at the beginning, but improved during our meal.  They refilled out drinks a few times without having to be asked. I got the spicy mussels.  They came on a big (HUGE) platter with a few sauteed veggies and a spicy sauce.  I know mussels aren't very good as a leftover, so I ate them all.   I didn't feel stuffed like Thanksgiving at the end of the meal, but properly sated. I will definitely be back again.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu.  Like Ayesha, I'd like to see more heat.  \"If it don't make ya cry, why would ya eat it??\" I'd also like to meet the owner.  I mean, since everything is so huge...maybe it's a reflection? ;}",

What was supposed to take 20 minutes to get our food took 35 minutes. We also had to return the food because what was supposed to be a #1 spicy was actually more like a #3. My husband, who loves spicy, couldn't even eat what was supposed to be the most mild. When I went back (after first calling them 15 minutes before to notify them I was coming in), I waited in the lobby for 10 minutes before being acknowledged. The lady responded that they were busy and seemed inconvenienced by me. I was the one who had to drive back and get my meal remade! I was very disappointed at the response and reluctance to fix the issue. The remake of the Beef Salad was slightly less spicy but at least we could eat it. I really enjoyed the entree but having my food wrong the first time and the bad customer service ruined the experience. We also had the fried appetizer sampler that was just okay. My husband goes there very frequently and loves this place. The portions are very large and prices very reasonable. I will go back and hopefully, this one experience was an isolated one.",

I've never been to Thailand, but it's clear that the owners care very much about bringing the authentic flavor of Thailand to its guests. The food is always fresh and consistent. I became addicted to many things on the menu and went twice per week for quite some time. I've since moved away and miss Thai e-San every day. The owners and the servers are such wonderful people, and they take the time to get to know you and remember all of the details. I never had to ask for special things I like, they just always knew. The ingredients are perfect and they handle each superbly. The spices they use to heat the dish are unlike any other place and they know the perfect balance of chili oil, paste, and powder/seeds and how to match it to the dish. The meats always taste fresh and take on the flavor of the dish whereas many other places cook the meat separately or overcook it. If you're looking for authentic, fresh, and friendly then this is your place!",

    "text": "So, Thai E-San, let's get down to business.   PREMISE ------------- I was hungry. I wanted dinner. But not a break the bank dinner. So it was either Gallo Blanco or Thai food. Guess which won.  SCENE ----------- Sitting discreetly on Indian School, facing the former shoeboxed-size aura of Chez Nous (now the fluorescent-lit cube which is Fresh N' Easy).   You walk in, and then find your way around some wooden partitions to encounter a room which is surprisingly very ornate. Painted walls, heavy, ornate tables and chairs (all of which still have the shrink-wrapped plastic covering on them - LOL). Traditional Thai folk music softly playing overhead...  I was the only customer at this point, expecting a friend to join me. I told the traditionally-dressed hostess there'll be a party of two. The room, however, did not have any table even remotely that small. She sat me at a round table for 6, which is fine, just a little amusing. I wondered what their lunch scene was like with a bunch of single diners eating on these giant tables.  FOOD AND SERVICE ------------------------------ My friend joined me a few minutes later and it took us a while to get our hostess' attention, given we were seated out of sight from the kitchen behind the wooden partition. We eventually ordered the following:  * Green papaya salad * Drunken noodles with chicken * Massaman curry with beef  All were ordered to be Thai spicy. Now, never in a Phoenix Thai restaurant have they actually made anything extra spicy (or done it well) whenever I've requested it, so I was skeptical, but thought it was worth trying anyway.  And so...  * Green Papaya salad - They sure as hell made it Thai spicy! It was good and I was loving the heat. Very fresh tasting (at least that evening). My friend was dying a little, slowly melting beside me, but was a trooper and kept on eating. Good work, amigo! Rating: 4/5  * Drunken noodles with chicken - If they actually gave us this dish, I'd more accurately rate it. However, what was placed in front of us was chicken stir fried with basil. No noodles anywhere. Neither of us were patient enough for them to take it back and make the correct dish, so we ate it anyway. Wasn't spicy. Wasn't bad either, per se, but not very memorable. 3/5  * Massaman curry with beef - I'm a big fan of this southern Thai dish when it's done well. The flavors are usually pretty distinguishable from the other coconut milk-based curries on a Thai restaurant menu (which should be the point) but this one wasn't really. Kind of generic and not very spicy either. And just like the previous dish - not bad, but not memorable either. 3/5  * Service - Decent, but non existent at times, which was weird given that we were the only diners in the room the entire time. Also, getting your orders wrong when there's no one else's orders to mix them up with is not so great.  FINAL VERDICT ---------------------- So it's an \"ok\" kind of place. Started out promising but drifted a little downwards from there. Ornately done room and very reasonable prices (which is a plus).   Would I eat here again? I think so. Maybe they had an off evening and nothing I had was bad.  Would I recommend it to others? If they're really curious about it, maybe. But in terms of Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area, there are definitely some better ones around (then again, there are worse ones, too).   Thai E-San sits comfortably in the middle of the pack.    3 stars.",

    "text": "My first Thai E-San experience was just funny.  Shortly after they opened, I went in for take-out.  There were all these menu possibilities (e.g., fish in noodles, etc...) that I had never seen before.  So, adventurous me decides: Must order.    Well, this inspires lots of interesting looks .... and finally (ions later) the food comes out and they say \"well, we never really made that dish with fish ... It might not be good... if not, return it...\"  (No, they didn't think to say something before they prepared the food...)  I go home and find myself separating the fish from the rest of the dish and eating the two dishes.   So, after that ... long Thai E-San haitis...  Find myself back there.  This time I ordered pad thai, figuring that they must have prepared pad thai.  The wait was shorter.  The pad thai came and the first thing that I realized was holding the pad thai package was like weightlifting... Yes, there was just that much food!  The food was good.  It was fresh.  But, seriously, it could feed a military.  The military of a small country, but a military.   My big complaint (after the fact that their portions are HUGE) was a massive lack of heat.  Next time I will ask for uber-spicy...",

    "text": "I typically judge the quality of Thai food by how well they make the beef salad, as was in this case. I ordered the beef salad to go, spicy level 5, which is hottest (I love spicy). The spiciness level is good, they didn't tone down. Overall, though, the balance between sour, sweet, and salty was off - I felt it was more on the sour side, and had to add extra fish sauce from home. The beef was supposed to be grilled where you can taste the charbroiled flavor, but I did not appreciate this at all; it had a more sauteed flavor. The portion was on the small side for the price. To be fair, the owner was very nice. I asked for the kaffir lime leaves (gives it a homely Thai flavor) and she gave me a handful on the side! Arguably the best Thai beef salad I had was Les Ros in San Francisco.",

The menu is expansive, with something for everyone, tofu, fish, chicken, squid, duck, beef, pork, vegetables, rice, noodles, you get the idea. The ingredients are fresh and high quality.  The prices are reasonable (especially considering the portions are enough for two meals) and they have great lunch specials.  The staff is courteous and friendly.

But it's not anything unexpected as far as decor. Much like the Indian restaurants on 8th Street in NYC, if it doesn't look like the inside of a fully lit Christmas tree, there's something wrong.  I enjoyed the substantive look of the chairs and tables, actually. Compared to the converted diner look of Thai Rama, there's much more opportunity for ambience in the evening, for sure.  Back to my food: I asked for it hot, and said \"I can handle it.\" I likes me some spicy. The hostess was super nice and I waited maybe ten minutes before my to-go bag arrived.  As a lunch special, it came with a spring roll and soup, which made quite the spread for ten bucks. The green curry was awesomely spicy, savory and the veggies were nice and crisp, however, I would have liked a firmer tofu in it. The rice was nice and sticky and aromatic, too.   Overall, I think Thai E San gave me a great calling card with that one dish. I will definitely go back with friends to try some more dishes we can all share to explore more of what the restaurant has to offer.",

However, its always worked out that if I tell them in advance that \"hey, if you serve me fish I am going to die\" that 99% of places step up. While I loathe our ultra litigious society (and thus I am a self loathing lawyer) when it comes to this sort of thing, my ilk has got it right. If they try to kill you, sue the hell out of them.  Tonight we were at a loss what to get for dinner. But wait, Thai E-San has done us right in the past, the food isn't greasy, and its pretty good though not authentic in any shape or form to Isan food.  We called in our to go order, and not once, not twice, but three times we told the woman on the phone to make sure that the spring rolls were vegetarian. Get it home, open it up, and low and behold its shrimp egg rolls.   I've learned over the years that if the food in the bag has fish on it, all of the food has fish on it. I can't afford to be down 5 days right now because someone can't get the order right over the phone.  What it really came down to was that at the same time someone phoned in a $150 order when we ordered our food. They made a conscious choice to go with the bigger order and to mess up an order of a regular.   Well, that's pretty simple for me. Won't ever going back in there. Ended up wasting $40 on dinner that I can't eat or smell. Awesome. I'd tell anyone who asks if you're looking for Thai in Phoenix, go anywhere else.",

The service is also amazing. If you have short lunch hours it's probably best to call in an order because their food is made fresh, so you actually have to wait",

    "text": "My review is solely based on the customer service I received on 3/4/17. When entering the building there was a woman in her fifties that seemed very...determined. In the parking lot she zoomed in to get a spot which we weren't after because there was plenty of spots and that one seemed to small for our Pilot. Funny enough we end up holding the door open for her as she pushes through. My MIL actually needed to use the restroom when we first arrived and so my FIL let her out before we parked. In turn she put our names in. As we enter our name is called, but the lady says, \"I'm first.\" The hostess is confused and frankly the lady seemed crazy. The place is empty and my FIL said, \"just seat her. It's fine.\" Everyone could tell this lady was crazy. She even complained she wasn't getting her \"normal\" booth. Yet nobody seemed to know her.  Our waiter was funny about the situation, but never disrespectful. Even when my son spilled water he made a joke about it and took care of the situation.  Yes the food was good. However, it was the customer service that I enjoyed. The \"lady\" could have put most people off, but our waiter really made us feel comfortable and they were attentive.",

We tried a ridiculous amount of Thai restaurants here in AZ this beats them ALL hands down, on food, service, presentation, everything!!!   The service is always great and attentive.

My curry was not that good to heavy, and thick. vegetables were lacking not too many. And the few vegetables that were in the curry were diced up very thinly and overcooked. very disappointing. I ordered brown rice which costs $2. And the small bowl was not even full. less than half full. my friend said his silver noodles were just ok. vegetables were overcooked. and their were not much noodles. The manager or owner or both came over and sat at our table to ask us how we liked our food. I metioned about the vegetables and my friend metioned about the overcooked veggies. and She was very gracious and asked us to come back and to make a special  request as to how we want the food. That was refreshing and made us feel validated.   Before we went to eat their we called to find out if they used MSG and the person on the phone said that \"no they did not use MSG\" so with that we decieded to go there to eat.   I found out they do use MSG. As I woke up last nite with a splitting headache the type of headache I only get if I consume MSG.   It sad because I wanted to give this place another try. however I don't think I will return they use MSG and that is poison and it makes me sick.",

When I order \"Thai hot\"  at other restaurants I am left disappointed. Here, my eyes water. That's what I'm talking about! They have quick service and it is family run. The owner's daughters are both vegetarian so she is quick to accommodate and also recommend dishes you might not even see on the menu. She is always there and will come and greet you every time you visit. My personal favorite here is the massaman curry.. The best in town without a doubt. They also serve amazing thom yum soup.. And it literally comes out on fire.. Well, there is a circle of fire around the soup bowl. Semantics.   This place has recently undergone a facelift. They used to have very over the top dining furniture which limited seating. They have since streamlined and added new booths. There is also a large flat screen usually featuring sports and they now offer wifi.   The last thing I really appreciate about this place is that they are open late!  Hands down my go to place for Thai. I tell everyone and bring everyone then repeat.",

Plus, the service here is always really friendly, and they even got my name right on the first try, which always impresses me.  In all honesty, whenever I eat Thai food, I almost always order the Pad Thai or pad see-ew. Both are great here. I've also had their spring rolls, soup, and mango with sticky rice. All of them are so delicious, and sometimes I want to come back just for the dessert.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this place almost every single day for the past couple weeks. My girlfriend never had Thai food before, so I made her try yellow curry with chicken... she now demands it just like how my cat demands canned food.  The royal curry (yellow) with chicken is the best I've had here in Phoenix, as well as the places I've eaten in California.   The gai ping is amazing as well, I'm still on my binge for that until I move on to something else on the menu. The spinach is fresh and crispy as well, I actually like it a lot. It goes perfect with the dish. This coming from somebody who doesn't really like spinach to begin with.  As far as service, my drink never hits the bottom and the staff checks up on us frequently to make sure we're squared away. They know that perfect balance of leaving you alone, but not neglecting you either. They've got a family vibe at this place, seeing as how it's a family run business, not hard to see why. They treat you like a guest in their house, a friend of the family. It doesn't have a typical restaurant/business transaction feel like many places out there. That's one of the reasons I keep coming here. Rather than the typical song and dance, orchestrated charade, I can actually come here and relax.  The atmosphere is kind of somewhat like a lounge or hang out spot with a very calm setting. The lighting isn't obnoxiously bright (bright lighting pisses me off), the music is nice and relaxing, kind of like 95.5 KYOT back in the day, and it's not very loud either. It's basically the perfect amount of background noise needed for the atmosphere.  The price of this place is actually quite reasonably priced compared to most of the other Asian restaurants I've been to. There's somebody else that commented about the price going up every time he eats here, I don't know what the fuck he's talking about. Your price will change if your order changes, that's a no brainer.   This place has basically become our default place to eat when we can't decide what we're hungry for.",

This was about 10 minutes from the science center, so not a bad drive from where we were at. It's off a pretty busy road, but we entered from the alleyway. There was plenty of parking in their lot - always a plus. Upon entrance, the restaurant itself gave me Midwestern basementy feels if you know what I mean...kinda dark, kinda dingy. But has its own charm for sure!  We ordered our thai staples...Massamun and pad see ew. It was very delicious, definitely on par with the best thai places we have been to in Phoenix. The prices were right and the portions were ample. We had enough to take some home too! We will definitely be back when we are in the area! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Awesome! We really liked this place. We went around 8pm on a Thursday night. There were people there, but the staff probably considered it a little slow. We both noticed that they had Christmas paintings up specifically for the holiday. It was a subtle thing, but an attention to detail that we both appreciated. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. He worked with an efficiency that you would expect of a task-oriented Asian fellow. It was also well-appreciated.  We ordered the Fish Cakes for an appetizer, the coconut soup with chicken (3/5 spiciness), and the red curry with chicken (3/5). The fish cakes were tasty but not our favorite. To be fair, I'm not sure we are fans of the \"fish cake\" in general, so it's possible that they were exactly what they should have been.  The weather was cold, for Phoenix, and this soup hit the spot like you wouldn't believe. It was fairly rich and the two of us had to struggle a little bit to finish it. (Spoiler: There was no actual struggling involved.)  We always try the red curry when visiting at new Thai place. It is our personal yardstick. This place did an excellent job. Red curry isn't the McDonald's hamburger of Thai cooking so it's always at least a little bit different depending on where you go. But, we loved it here. Good level of heat (we both like spicy) and a really nice flavor.  If you're in the neighborhood and looking for Thai food, I'd definitely put this on your \"To Try\" list.",

We love the spicy noodles and basil and the pad see ew. I'm vegan too and they have so many options for vegan!! The service is so friendly too! If you have never tried before you have too! The outside may not be the nicest, but the inside and the food is perfection!! Friday and Saturday nights are the busiest so if you could go on a week night or Sunday then that would be my recommendation.",

All the napkins were perfectly folded n propped up on all the tables n they had TVs going so in case you wanted to watch a game etc.   We started off w some hot tea. My husband got the garlic stir fry w beef spicy level 3 (spicy levels 1-5 like usual Thai places) and I got the house pad Thai which comes w shrimp n chicken spicy level 4.   Both dishes were very flavorful. The service was impeccable n very attentive.   N we finished off w mango sticky rice which i wasn't a fan of. I just don't like sticky rice n it was covered in some sauce which I didn't care for. But since my husband ordered it I had a bite.  Overall, will definitely b coming back. Excellent Thai food!!!",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today and it was awesome. Chicken Pad Thai is my go-to at Thai restaurants and this was my favorite. On a scale of 1-5 of spiciness, I did 3 (medium) and it was hotter then most places - but I really liked it. Like loved it. There was so much flavor and the lunch special was a great deal, $8.99 for the entree, spring roll, fried won ton chips, and free soup of the day as an appetizer. They also give you a free dessert which was 3 mini donuts? I don't know for sure what they were but they were similar to sugared donuts. They were good.  This place was really busy, we went at peak time around 12:30 but the service was very fast and the employees very friendly. They found us a table quickly and the food and drink came out fast. It's a comfortable atmosphere.  Definitely would recommend, but if you're afraid of spice go lower on the scale!",

Friendly staff, great food, and a calming atmosphere give this restaurant an A in my book.  Myself and two other friends enjoyed a few dishes, as we were told most were meant to be shared.  What was selected: Lemon Grass soup with Chicken, Fish, and Squid; Yellow Chicken Curry; and Chicken Pad Thai.  The Lemon Grass soup was just what was expected, deliciously tangy with some nice heat.  Tender fish, chicken, and squid was portioned liberally and melted in my mouth.  The Yellow Chicken Curry and Pad Thai were pretty standard, though definitely not a disappointment.  Everything was excellent, though I have a feeling if it wasn't, the chef would have corrected it for us.  She was very helpful, even came out to make sure everything was to our standard.  I will be back.",

The first place I went to wasn't actually where Yelp said it was. Strike one. The second place I went to wasn't open. Either they were closed on Sundays or only for dinner. Strike two. The third and final location I was going to try was Thai E-San. The building was where Yelp said it was and they were open. Third times the charm.   Pretty good sized menu. Lots of seafood options. Nice list of appetizers. Full bar. And really spicy dishes. Score!   When ever I try a new Thai place I almost always go with the Pad Thai. To me it's the dish to judge how all their other dishes will be and so far it has served me well. Their Pad Thai was no exception.  I loved it, the son loved it. I would definitely go back.",

And then this is funny but not: we ordered brown rice. Didn't know about extra charge but don't care either. Lunches came out with white rice as supposed to. I mentioned I want brown rice. They were quick to scoop up our plates, put that white rice BACK for the next customer (not cool), and happily brought us each our own orders of $2 brown rice (we could have shared one). But!.... If white rice is included and I had to pay $2 extra for brown rice; wasn't i entitled to the white rice already on my plate as well, rather than it being \"recycled\" for next customers?

I had Tom kha which they call coconut soup, it was quite good with chicken, plenty of chicken and mushrooms.  Second dish is number 70 in the menue, it was a disaster, Pa nang beef, it was soupy, and beef portion was so small that I  had to dig for it, beef was over coocked.  Third dish chicken snd namboo, again vrry small portion of chicken and strangely spiced, this is number 48 on the menue. NEITHER DISHES WAS GOOD. Nice portion of rice, here you pay $2 extra for brown rice. I would rather stick to Wild Thaiger.  The reason I went to this restaurant was because Sunday noon Wild Thaiger is closed!  It is over valued by LOCAL who give it high ranking in Yelp. Mediocare food!",

    "text": "While there seems to be a saturation of Thai restaurants in the Central Corridor, I'm not one to complain when something new comes along the pike. And Thai E-San is a welcome addition to the eateries in our area. And being opened less than a week didn't stop us from trying this place out.   For starters, Thai E-San took over the former Big Wong space. Since I'd not been in there in ages, I'm not sure if the new tenets did a massive overhaul or if they moved into this clean space. It feels more like you're visiting your Asian aunt than walking into a restaurant. The tables and chairs are so huge, I felt dwarfed by them. The multicolored lights cast interesting hues in the room. But it is a little too cold, temperature-wise for me.   Okay, on to the food. Robert M ordered the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli; I ordered the beef Mas-Sa-Mun curry. Robert's meal wasn't exactly what he expected, which would have been cubed pork chops battered and deep fried. Rather, it was pork with the skin still on and crispy. I liked it. The Mas-Sa-Mun was beef stewed in a coconut milk sauce with potatoes, green onions and peanuts. I'll get it again, but hotter than mild as it lacked the kick. But, I ordered weak so that's what I received.   There were a few hiccups: service wasn't very attentive, the dishes came out at different times, another table received soup instead of fried rice (but the guy was a nimrod who insisted on eating with chopsticks and proceeded to holler at the staff from across the room), and the bill was delayed in its arrival. All things that should iron themselves out as the staff--which appeared relatively new to waiting tables--grow more accustomed to their craft and the kitchen becomes better choreographed. The prices seems a little high, but in these times I feel like any amount could be consTrued as \"too high.\"   I'll definitely be back, but to order different items and find their signature dishes. I'm thinking their \"Special noodles, Soup\" items are looking mighty fine and the lunch specials sound like a great bargain, starting at $7.95 for a lunch dish, fried wonton, egg roll and cup of soup.",

They greeted you in a very polite and helpful way. They even give u 3 tasty mini donuts after your entree. This could become my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. At least for lunch!!  Highly recommend.",

I told the server & she seemed annoyed & was a bit condescending about it but got me an pad see ew instead. After that incident she avoided our table & was not very friendly. I felt so uncomfortable, I had already felt horrible and embarrassed for sending something back, her attitude just made it so much worse. The replacement was decent & the lady at the front was so warm & friendly. I'm not sure if we'll be back anytime soon due to the server (or maybe we will do take-out next time)",

    "text": "Heat seekers, Thai E-San and Thai food in general knows how to serve up the heat!  For Thai food, I always order a soup, some kind of noodle, Thai tea and dessert. So to start, I did share with my room mate for dinner so let that be known before I am deemed a glutton. We did the Seafood Tom Yum, Pad See Ew and Mango Sticky Rice.  The Thai tea was good, sweet and strong (I didn't sleep till 3AM). Seafood Tom Yum had good flavor, not MSG laden, filled with seafood (mussels, scallops, shrimp, squid)  Pad See Ew with beef, yummy flat rice noodles with strips of beef, savory and spicy! Mango Sticky Rice was good, though the rice was a bit too wet for my liking and the portion I felt was a bit small for the price point.  For all the food, we asked for Medium heatwise and I thought it was perfect! I do like spicy food though, but there is a burn!  All in all, Thai E-San puts out solid Thai food. The owner came by to talk to us and also made sure everything was alright with the food. The food tastes pretty authentic to me!",

    "text": "They messed up my order twice, took an hour to finally get my dish right and the management is rude and clueless on how to properly run a restaurant. I went on mothers day with my girl. I ordered the red curry tofu with pineapples and a thai iced tea. I got my meal way after everyone at my table and the table next to ours got their food. When my dish finally came, about 38 minutes after I ordered it, the server brought me the wrong dish. She came with vegetable red curry. There wasn't any tofu in the dish at all. I mentioned to the server that she brought me the wrong dish and she tried to tell me that that was indeed what I ordered when I know I mentioned tofu at least 4 times to her. She said the tofu would be an extra $2. I told her I refused to pay extra for something that should have came in my dish. Why would I keep the wrong dish and pay extra for what I wanted? She eventually agreed with me and took my dish and said she would fix it. Another 15-20 minutes later she came with my plate again, this time it had tofu but it didn't have any pineapples. I got up from my seat and had to walk to my server since she was far away from me and I was extremely hungry at that point. The server told me \"they forgot to put it back, I'll bring it to you now.\" It sounded like they picked out the veggies and the pineapples and threw tofu in the bowl, I hope they didn't use their hands for the process. I was upset cause I thought I was getting a new bowl of what I actually ordered, not the previous wrong dish they brought earlier with stuff taken out, not just the pineapples, with tofu thrown in. The manager stopped by to ask me if everything was okay after the first dish came and I told her no cause I was still hungry and still didn't get what I ordered about an hour after we got to the restaurant. She later came back and said my girl's son looked like a girl even though he doesn't and brought me her left overs from the the original dish they got wrong for me. She said her dinner was the plate they originally brought me and it was too spicy for her so she wanted me to have a little cup of what she couldn't finish. I was really offended that she thought I would want her left overs and that she called my girl's son a girl on mothers day of all days. The food was good but the experience was horrible. This my first and last time ever coming here. They got my order wrong twice, it took an hour to finally get my dish right, the manager gave me her left overs, the manager called my girlfriend's son a girl. All of that and she didnt even offer us a discount until my girl mentioned to the manager that she was offended by her calling her son a girl, and the only discount she gave was $6 off a $57 check after the horrible experience we had. I wrote on the tip section of the check, read my yelp review, I really hope she reads this and realizes that she could have made our experience better but instead everything she did just made it worse. We are never coming back.",

    "text": "My bridal party decided to take me here to eat for my bachelorette dinner and when they called to make reservations the staff offered to call and have a stripper come out. I was like WTH kinda thai restaurant are you guys taking me to?!?  For a Friday night they were pretty slow. Place is pretty spacious and big enough to hold big parties. Please check the silverware and cups prior to using it. My girlfriend saw a lipstick stain on her cup.   we got the usual safe thai dishes: curry, pad thai, papaya salad, pad see ew, tom yum soup, etc.   for a party of 6... we got quite a few plates to do family style. the portions were really small. so we each couldn't either get seconds or get a generous amount. usually in LA it's easy to do family portions because the amount is pretty big. I zoomed in on my pictures that's why it looks like the portion is big btw.   to be honest, nothing was really memorable food wise. if you truly had nothing else to eat and was craving thai then i would say come here. they ask if you want stuff spicy and would give you a very big scale to rate from. i believe it was 1-10 which is a really big scale to choose from. As a side note: I'm just spoiled by all the food options in LA and it's truly hard to not compare it to what I'm used to. Therefore my review may be totally different than a local.   staff speaks english really well. dimmed parking lot and inside.   Tips: -has its own parking lot.  -takes reservations -cash and credit cards accepted -adds gratuity for parties of 6 or more.  -small portions -indoor seating only -they do catering.",

The decor was a red wood and Asian art with plants. The smells were fantastic. The restaurant was clean and organized. We were seated and ordered off of a vast lunch menu. I ordered the Masaman curry with 3 of 4 spiciness. The waitress warned that it would be fairly spicy, I told her it was ok. She said, that if I needed more; there was spicy chili's at the center of the table. Everyone of us had a different order, different spiciness and a separate bill. I could not have asked for a better restaurant. The food was served hot and was very flavorful.

For example, those tiny half filled hot sauces given with to-go orders that are typically free everywhere are a dollar each here! They will only give one incredibly small chili paste with to-go orders. Mind you I spent over $50 for my order. Another thing that got me is if you want brown rice instead of white, they charge another $2.50 on top. That's is very cheap. Most Thai establishments don't charge the extra for that. Or at least not to that extent.  To sum up- small portions for mediocre food, over priced, greedy.",

Afterwards, they served us some soup (it was sour, and I loved it!).   They took our orders and I was torn between the red curry and the pad thai, but I went ahead with the curry. My boyfriend got the yellow curry. The yellow curry tastes like curry indian curry, and the red curry is sweet. Both were very delicious and the serving was decent. All in all I spent around $30 for two thai tea's and two curries which is not bad at all!  I will definitely come back and take my family here. All in all, great food and great service!",

Spicy level runs 0-5, I ordered the chicken Pad Thai, level 3 and it was a good kick in the butt! After a few bites I was sweating a bit and runny nose but I loved it! So if you're looking for some real heat besides the sun , this is the place!! Counter attacked the spicy ness with a dessert , House made coconut ice cream, brought me back to normal!! Thai tea was no disappointment! Blessings!",

This time, I ordered takeout around lunchtime and expected the wait to be long, but it was still only 20 minutes! I ordered the spicy noodles with basil with chicken at a spice level of 2 and the green curry with chicken at a spice level of 3. I think I always get the spicy noodles with basil, the pad see ew, or pad Thai but I really should branch out because I haven't had anything here that I have disliked. The green curry is definitely my favorite dish here and the spice level of 3 is perfect for me. Their spice level is from 1-5 if you've never been here. If you love Thai food, make sure to check this restaurant out!!",

Friendly= this place gets customer service, makes you feel like family, probably because they're a family operated.   LOVE, love, love good Thai Food,   Update: 12/26/18 Still love Thai E San, however if I could give one complaint, the wait time for food is getting consistently long. I've been here multiple times for dinner, and they need more help! They have no empty tables tonight, people waiting, and there is one waitress and one other hostess. So far we've waited 45 minutes, had our waters refilled, but no apology for the long wait. Hopefully they realize they are a busy restaurant and need to hire more help!",

    "text": "Currently jumping with joy because this place is just seriously so good. I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00 pm with a friend and was able to be seated quite quickly.   I had an insane craving for thai eggplant and knew right off the bat that I would be ordering their stir fried eggplant with tofu. My friend went with the stir fried cashew with beef and both dishes of course came with a generous side of white rice. First off, flavor wise, my eggplant dish was INSANELY good. Savory and spicy without being overwhelming or one note. My friend also loved his stir fried cashew beef and said that he wished that he lived closer to Thai E-San so he could get it more often.   They do ask you for spice level when you order -- on a scale of 1 to 5 -- and I went with a 3/5 because I have a tendency to add chili sauce and pickled jalapenos to my food when I eat. Aka ordered a medium spice level because I'd inadvertently increase it by adding heat filled condiments. I do have to add that the chili sauce, pickled jalapenos, pickled chilis, and crushed chili pepper on the side were all super delicious and spicy. My friend ordered his food at 4/5 spice level and loved it, but was also chugging water.   Our server was super sweet and checked on us pretty often. Prices are good and I had a great experience here overall! Definitely my favorite thai place in PHX.",

I searched the surrounding area and found Thai E-San and it sounded perfect. When I arrived I recognized it as place I've driven past a hundred times but never stopped in.   The menu is expansive and there indefinitely something for just about everyone!! We had the potstickers for an appetizer and a couple drinks, everything started out right.   The meals were perfect! I had Salmon in Green Curry and it was Wonderfully flavorful!!!  I got it at a spice level 2 and it was enough to make my nose run!!  The bill was only about $65 and I left stuffed and satisfied! If you're looking for a place that isn't pretentious and won't break your bank check out Thai E-San!!!",

My mouth was watering before I even made it inside. The smells helped my boyfriend who was a Thai food newbie and unsure of what we were about to experience. The inside is small and quaint which I loved. All of the employees provided great service and were very friendly. Let's get to the food! We ordered some egg rolls and crab wontons to start. The egg rolls were somewhat greasy however the flavor was very savory and the outside of the roll was nice and crisp. The crab wontons were my favorite by far, they were perfectly bite sized and filing didn't ooze out when I took a bite. They had a perfect mix of cream cheese and crab. For entrees I got the classic chicken pad Thai level 1 spicy because I was scared! (Spice levels are 1-5) Portion was ginormous. The flavor was on point! Level 1 spicy is not hot at all. But all the pad Thai flavors were there. My boyfriend ordered the AZ fried rice, level 3 spicy. Huge pieces of grilled chicken were served on top. The level 3 spicy had a little kick but if you like spicy food you won't be crying. This is a spot we will definitely be hitting up again!",

Both of us loved it all, tho I must say the Satay was great and the Peanut Butter sauce almost as good as my hubby makes.(can't say better, or I will be in trouble).  For the entree, he had a Stir Fried Basil, with combo meats, and he loved it!!!I was having a hard time choosing and my server kindly offered to help by asking me what I liked and how spicy; Have to say, he chose great; It was the Stir Fry Silver noodles with vegetables,, and chicken. Never had Silver noodles before, but sure will again.  Suffice to say we loved it all, and yummy on all the sauces. The ambience is also nice, and we were treated so well by the staff we felt like VIP's! You can bet we recommend it, and we cant wait to go back and try other menu items; The menu is extensive, and if it is all as good as last night, we will become regulars.  I sure would recommend you try it out. Prices are reasonable, also.",

While I try to be a decent tipper, this was the first time in a long time when I didn't feel any remorse about leaving no tip.  The catfish that was served was slathered in sauce to the point where I didn't recognize what it was.   The seafood stir-fry something or other was decent, as was the something-or-other soup, but by the time it was finally brought out, I didn't even care. I just wanted to leave because I had been waiting so long.  The only redeeming factor was one of the servers/hosts comping us a beer and a Thai tea because of the delay in getting our food. Otherwise this would have been a zero-star review.  Thai E-San may have decent food, but they need to learn how to handle a semi-busy night. This was an utter and complete FAIL as a dining experience. They need to learn how to better operate their kitchen and deliver the dishes ordered in a timely manner. Few foods are worth waiting for as long as we did.  Until they get their act figured out, I recommend going somewhere else for Thai food.",

They give very generous portions and the prices are decent. We had egg rolls and fried tofu as appetizers. The tofu was the perfect crispness and the thai sweet chili sauce was sooo good (comes with peanuts, so if you have an allergy, don't forget to tell them to make it without).   I had pad see ew with fried tofu and loved that they put chinese broccoli in it. That's how the place back home makes it. They also have regular broccoli too so its a nice mix. The noodles and sauce were really good and not at all overcooked. I also got pad thai to go (with chicken and shrimp) and it smells and looks really good. (I'm eating it for lunch tomorrow!) My friends got duck penang curry and chicken green curry with level 3 spicyness. They can eat spicy, but it was hitting them pretty hard tonight, so you might want to watch out for that.   Overall I was very happy with the food! The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy at night and it's a bit far from where I live, but it's close to where we did yoga so that was convenient. There was one semi-creepy guy refilling our water, but that didn't bother me too much because I was starving and the food hit the spot tonight!",

They will prepare your dish as spicy as you want, I enjoy really spicy food and they do a great job accommodating my request.  I usually either get shrimp or scallops with my dish, and they always are fresh and high quality.   I did not have an issue with the portion size.   I had plenty of food on my plate and left satisfied.   The food has a very clean taste and does not leave you feeling too full and uncomfortable.   I will definitely continue going here and will recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant in central phoenix area.",

    "text": "I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I am an absolute weenie when it comes to trying new places with foods I've never heard of before!  It's True.  Yes I have managed to review over 400 places before ever trying Thai food.  Weird, right?  Anyway, my New Year's Resolution this year was to be more adventurous when it came to dining, and I am determined to embrace that resolution.  I'm doing really well so far, I mean, I ate Thai food!  As we were walking in, I started freaking out a little bit, because when I get scared of food, I order something really lame, and then I get really grumpy.  I kept telling myself that this was just a different version of Chinese food, which I love.  Once we got inside, I had to stifle the laughter upon seeing the epic tables.  Each one could literally seat 10 people.  They don't have anything smaller.  Seriously.  Anyway, we sat down and were kind of ignored for a while, got menus, got ignored, got drinks, ordered, got ignored, got food, ignored again, paid, then left.  You get the idea here?  The service is pretty horrendous.    I didn't know what to order, and I found myself gravitating towards familiar things.  I told myself that ordering familiar would be pointless, so I went with Beef Pad See Yew.  I was definitely avoiding the spicy after seeing the table next to us sweating and crying after eating some soup that was a level 3.  Sheesh!  Once my dish (beef, broccoli, fat rice noodles, and bean sprouts) came out, I pretty much devoured what I could.  the portions were huge, and I ate about half.  It was really good!  I still don't know what I think of Thai food, but I did eat the leftovers the next day and still enjoyed them.  I probably won't come back here to dine in just because the service is a little much to handle, but it could be really fun with a big group.  I think take out would be the way to go.",

Then TOm Yum soup came right after angel wings, it took us 15-20 min to finish those soup and appetizer. The meal came a little late BUT the taste was so GOOD. My spicy eggplant was little too hot, but don't worry I love it! I'm not a big fan of noodle dish but my mom ordered Rad Nah noodle with gravy sauce. That dish was surprise me! I think I like noodle from now on. We would love to try mango sticky rice for dessert BUT we were so full , maybe next time. The food portion was so big, finally we finished it all, and have a very great evening!!!   Thank you Thai E-San, I will be back soon.",

It's really intense. My fiance really likes the Thai toast. The curries are also really great, can't go wrong with any of them. Their dishes range from 1-5 scale of spiciness. 1 is low, and 5 is max hot.  They ask you how spicy you want it and customize the dishes to your liking. The lunch prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. We don't live in the neighborhood anymore but when we did, we used to go all the time.",

    "text": "So San-E-Tize (as I like to call it) has been staring at me every time I go to F&E and I finally convinced my wife to try Thai food.  We went over here on a Saturday night and I was totally excited for a new place.  But then the bad service started.  We were seated, then ignored, then we got drinks, and were ignored again.  Then we were asked if we were ready to order (which we were) and then ignored again.  This was getting a little old. I finally ordered a Sweet Basil something with chicken.  It was a runny mess that was lacking in meat.  It needed noodles or rice or something to thicken the dish up.  It really just wasn't very good. I ordered it with a #4 spicy level and it was about there (maybe a 2 or 3 in my book).  I don't know if the 6 is insane or not but I don't know who would be willing to ruin their meal just to try and find out. In the end, I wasn't really impressed.  The large tables are just comical, the service is sub-par, and the food was just blah.  I posted a picture of my meal just for reference.  I might go back and try something with rice next time but this was just not what I wanted.",

    "text": "Twas'  a Friday evening and I worked way too late, so  I decided to pick something up to go at a relatively new Thai  restaurant close to where I live.   Thai E-San doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you walk inside - you are transported to a different world.  Although I have never been to Thailand, I could only imagine that this is the kind of restaurant one might find there.  Beautiful tapestries, huge granite- inlay  tables  and an ambiance that transports you to a different place and time. For a Friday night at 7p.m. it wasn't that busy - only three other tables- two of which were single guys.  So I ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with shrimp only , and was offered a seat while I waited.  The only server  working asked me if I would like water or tea and since I thought that it would only be a few minutes,  I politely thanked her but declined. 45 minutes later.........  I finally had my to-go  order.  But please , let me digress.......  After 20 minutes of waiting  I got up and stood in front of the reception counter and looked into the kitchen.  There were only two persons working in the kitchen; I assumed one to be the cook and a prep cook. I had asked the only server who was running ragged ( mostly to the kitchen asking (in Thai?? ) where the food was).  She told me the cooks were from Thailand.     It looked like a Laurel and Hardy comedy back there.   The (prep cook?) kept wringing her hands and pulling her hair  and dropping things.  The cook (I assume) kept yelling at the poor woman (no wonder she was discombobulated).   Ok . let's talk about the food.   My Pad Thai was ok.  I had asked for a side of the chili sauce (which they forgot to add) as  I like my food spicy.  These were really mild.  Also , the noodles were gummy and stuck together.  I was wondering if they overcooked the noodles in their confusion to get the other diners food out (which, I observed also took way too much time) .  I have read some rave reviews about this place.  So I do want to give it another try before giving my final decision. I am willing to forego some hiccups with service and food as I appreciate the fact that this is an authentic restaurant with immigrants from Thailand, and that it may take some time to get their act together to  provide consistency in service and food.  I really do want them to succeed.  I'll try again next month so as to give them some time to get their act together.  Hopefully, I'll have a better review next time.        Chow for now :-)",

I hoped they were still open as most places close @2:30 pm.    Yes they were open and they serve lunch specials till 3:00pm/ Wonderful!  Guess what else???? They do not close after lunch and reopen for dinner. They just stay open.                                                                                 You know when you want food, but cannot go until 3, but nothing is open till 5:00. No worries here they are open all day!                                                                  When i came in at 2:30 i was the only one there,though more people came in later. It smelled wonderful and i was greeted and sat immediately.   My waiter Julio was adorable and sweet. He brought me some lovely hot green tea in a half glass Tea pot. It was delish!  The decor is very nice with a lot of sparkle. Slight Christmas decorations tasteful and not over done. Bathrooms were nice and clean as well.                         For food, I got the yellow curry with Shrimp. First he brought out the soup that came with  it. Wonderful chicken and rice soup. It was so good.                                          Spice taste is 1 through 5, i ordered a 3.  The rice was fluffy and not all stuck together as some places have. The curry dish was incredible, it also came with an egg roll and some fried chips. Even the egg roll was good with fresh veg inside.  I am so happy i went there. I can't wait to go back. After you have finished your meal, they bring you some fresh cut watermelon.  Just enough to clean your palette.     This is the place to be!!",

The person at the counter was focusing on handling other tickets and was not friendly at all. It also looks like the prices were higher than the menu listed on Yelp from another user.  Now to the food: The egg rolls were delicious, a little greasy but had a great taste.  The curry was just okay, the rice was hard and tasted under-cooked. The beef and flavor of the curry were both decent but not great.   I don't plan on returning to this restaurant, I would rather go to Wild Thaiger.",

The food was delicious and a great price. Then came a piece of watermelon for dessert. Well, my co-worker does not like watermelon and it was not ripe enough for me so we pushed it to the side of the table. The plates probably sat at our table for about 5 minutes when one of the waiters came by and asked if we were going to eat the watermelon. We said no so he picked the plates up and walked away. The problem with this is he walked right up to the cooler that is visible from the seating and stuck both those plates of watermelon right back into it! Then, while we are still sitting there in disbelief, he takes the same two pieces of watermelon that sat on our table back out of the cooler and served it to a table that was one down from us...DISGUSTING!!! If they do that with the watermelon then what are they doing with everything else that is not eaten or finished? Think about it?! It took all my restraint not to blow up that situation right in the middle of the restaurant and, actually, I really regret not blowing it up knowing that a lady was eating my piece of watermelon as I left. I am sure she would not have been happy. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN.",

We were not welcomed, and after a awkward two minutes up front the hostess walked to the tables with some menus and we assumed to follow her.  We got to our table and review the lunch menu, pretty much standard items. We waited some time before we put in our orders, we also hand to remind the waitress that we needed to order drinks.  After a decent wait our soup came,   and then our waters.  The soup was decent and it was fun to spicy with the condiment tray on the table.  We then waited, waited and waited,  47 minutes after we entered our food arrived, this does not work well for a lunch.  My Druken Noodles were mushy and soft. (6.95 combo)  The Won-ton chips were quite stale and my meal did not even come with the egg roll that the menu indicated was included.  Just a note if you decide to come here for some reason their spice scale is the same 1-5 but 3 is hotter than you usual 3.  We then played the waiting game again to get some dogie bags and our bill which we just paid upfront.  There are faster, and better options around that are worth the extra $1.",

If you like curry, specifically yellow curry, definitely try it here it is my favorite dish so far! The spicy greens beans are also pretty good! The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the service. One time we had to wait close to 45 minutes to get our food, granted there was a HUGE party there that got served just after we sat down so I assume that slowed the kitchen up. The other time we didn't have to wait long for our food at all but after our food came, we didn't see our waiter again for close to an hour (me and my girlfriends were catching up so we didn't really mind).

It's the sort of place that fat English guys wanting to recreate their holiday in Pattaya or Koh Samui would go.   Again, I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal.    Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand.  Isan, is a poorer, ethnic minority in Northeastern Thailand that is significantly influenced by Laos.  True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb (ground meat, mint, and lime) , som tum (papaya salad), gai yang (grilled chicken), and sai krok isan (isan sausage).   Any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of Isan food, should serve these dishes with mastery.  Thai E-San does offer them, albeit at a ridiculous premium, but does so disappointingly.    It is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in Phoenix.  Save your money and go elsewhere... unless you are an English tourist in need of nostalgia... in which case, proceed with my blessing!",

    "text": "We were greeted quickly and very warmly upon our arrival. I asked if they had a cocktail menu and they did not, so I asked for a mojito. They didn't know how to make that, so I asked for a tequila with soda and lime. The bartender came back to our table about 5 minutes later and said they didn't have lime. What?! Isn't lime one of the primary ingredients in Thai food? The crispy spring rolls arrived and while I would have preferred spring rolls without chicken, they were hot and fresh, if not a bit greasy. The pad thai was nicely seasoned but again, could have used the acidity of the lime to balance out the sweetness of the tamarind. My husband enjoyed his royal yellow curry with chicken and we shared the egg fried rice. Service kind of went downhill as the restaurant got busier. Our waters were not refilled and we were not asked if we wanted additional drinks. We sat around for about 15 minutes waiting for the waiter to ask if we wanted our check and finally, we just got up and went to the front register to cash out.",

Usually I am disappointed after a salad entree because I am still hungry afterwards, but that was not the case here! The portion was filling.

It is in a nondescript building (aren't most in Phoenix?) across from the Fresh & Easy at 7th Ave & Indian School. Inside it's very nice, including the large tables and throne-like chairs. The menu is extensive. Trying a variety of options and eating family-style, I can't remember the names of all the dishes except to say everything was good. Most especially, I can't quit thinking about the Thai ribs. I would swim in that sauce.",

I, on the other hand, enjoy them. We were seated at one end and then joined soon after by a very nice couple. We bantered back and forth a bit and he realized he knew me from my restaurant. Love that!  So, as I said above we were seated. And then waited. And waited. And. Waited. Some. More. Eventually waters were dropped but no beverage order was taken. Again, waiting. Cue the Jeopardy theme music. Finally one of the two servers came by (and in all honesty, they were pretty busy) and dropped off soups, which come with the $6.49 lunch special. Yummy! I ordered tofu fried rice and Rickie had sweet and sour pork. Mine was fantastic, though sadly they neglected to include my spring roll. I would have flagged someone down but I was consumed with worry over my table mate's missing food. They served her friend's food yet hers took at least 10 minutes. Strange. Rickie wasn't pleased with his dish as it was pretty teeny tiny!  Two lunch specials. Two beverages for $18. Not bad. Oh. The decor is so Thai...bright green and gold speckled walls with beautiful Thai rugs. And. Then. For some odd Asian reason...like at China Chili random pieces of scrap paper taped to the walls saying \"Dessert. Mango Sticky Rice\".  With a little gay spray I could bump this baby up a star!",

My roommate is Thai and this is one of the only places she hits up on a regular basis.   Food: AMAZEBALLS! All of their servings and portions are SUPER HUGE. The Spring Rolls are the size of cucumbers and only $3 for two of them. The Chicken Satay was also tasty with 6 skewers for about $8. Between the two of us, I think we've ordered about 1/2 of the menu, but I really enjoy their fried rice, pad thai, the stir-frys and the chicken curry. As a BIG fan of spicy food, I love how I can control the level of hotness for EACH plate. You can rank them from a 1-5, and the 5 is quite spicy and YUMMERS!  Service: YES....YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT!! The food is prepared TO ORDER and unfortunately, the owners don't trust anyone else to make the food, so there's only ONE COOK!! I've never gone on a super busy night (because I KNOW better) so the longest I've ever waited was about 30 minutes, but since the food is SOOOO good I don't mind.   The waitresses are really nice, but if you want assistance, don't be afraid to flag them down. They're happy to help.",

While guest were trickling in the one server took her time getting drinks, placing orders, and bringing out plates etc. I mean we called prior to give the restaurant a heads up on our large party. It still took them forever to serve us. I believe it took a hour for them to take my order. The food was good when we finally got it but I was annoyed once I received my bill to see that I was charged gratuity in the amount of $16 dollars. After the wait to place my order then to get my order you would had thought there would had been some kind of compensation. Smh very disappointed because while the food was good, the service was crappy. The owner is very nice but she has to be more prepared for large groups.

The presentation of the soup was also cool with flames shooting up the middle.  They had a great homemade sweet-and-sour sauce on every table. Upon request, they bring a caddy with 4 different condiments (smoky ground chili peppers, jalapenos in vinegar, Thai chilis in fish sauce, and sambal).  The sambal especially was very good!  The staff was very friendly and took time to explain menu items to us even though they were very busy. Will definitely be back!",

Most places I end up just fishing for the wontons and ignoring the broth. This soup is different because it is so good all the way around that even when the chicken and wontons have been picked out everyone I've ever taken here has helped finish the entire thing off. The silver noodles and chicken satay are also good.  I think they have the best cucumber/vinegar salad of the local Thai restaurants, it's addicting. Thai tea is of course always a hit.   Decor is...random and sometimes there are too many plates/dishes set up for various courses and it gets crowded/chaotic. Music selection over the speakers is horrible but it can be used as comedy during the meal.",

First off, I thought the ambiance was nice- Asian flair in the decorations, fresh cut roses at each table, etc. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, my go to Thai dish and even though I went at an off hour (1600 on a weekend), my food came out in probably 5-7 minutes. It was good, but it definitely wasn't the best I've had. On a scale of 1 to 10, I got a 5 for spice and I thought the spiciness reflected that- which I appreciated. Too often I ask for spicy but don't ever experience a hint of it. I don't know where they get their shrimp but it's definitely not normal sized shrimp- it's gigantic. And delicious. And sparse. I just thought there was something missing. Maybe the tamarind, maybe the peanuts, maybe not enough bean sprouts. It didn't have that fundamental and signature \"umph\" I usually taste in the Thai food I ate in NYC. I will say three things: 1: it was definitely the wettest Pad Thai I had. There was an abundance of sauce. 2: the portions are giant. 3: the service is perfect. I guzzle down water while eating and found that my glass was never empty or even half empty. Definitely recommend.",

I went with the Shrimp and Scallops in Peanut Sauce. When she asked if I want hot, I hestitated than said yes. Than she said 1-5, 3 I replied. I could've went with 4 or even 5, I like it spicy! Out of the whole dish, two bites were actually spicy. The shrimp and scallops were HUGE, there was only three of each in the dish. The dish was just okay. I didn't have time to research it which is why I went with the day's special, a \"safe\" choice.  The service was really decent, it was like they read my mind. I was taking a second bite thinking I wish there was more sauce in my dish when the waitress asked if I would like some. Than later I was thinking its freezing in here, thank goodness I had my sweater, when a woman walked up and said she's cold and if I was, and she turned down the A/C.  This same woman apoligized if she was being to loud on the phone, which it was loud conversation with the phone being passed around, but I barely noticed...I'm used to it.  They were all very nice and my water was not allowed to get past the half way mark.  I also got the Thai Eggroll (2) which were good. I like that they had the sweet and sour in the squirt bottles. It controls waste and its helps me aim specifically where I want it. LoL. The enitre meal was just under 20$, a bit pricey for what I got. But like I said, I went for the safe dish and will go back to try something different.",

And if you know me I love to try new Thai places, love the culture and spice. Right when you walk in you get greeted and seated. It's a cute small place the interior is dim well light well decorative small lights and very Asian influenced. Menu has a wide selection of eats from appetizers to main dishes noodles, rices and salads of sorts. They also have a lot of authentic Thai dishes, that a person of Thai or Laos person like me would know of. Our service was delightful and on point, food came out wonderful and Thai Hot is very hot, I wanted to finish cause it was so good, but it was too hot. Definitely recommend coming here and bring friends of course. So if you aren't a fan of hot, the taste is defiantly here as well, I would say get at least a 3 or 2 hot! Remember stay hungry Phoenix!",

Now here comes my food critic side and knowing the cuisine from growing up in California and spending summers in Thailand. The food at Thai E-San is not bad I just want to reiterate that. However I feel that they can do so much better. For instance for our appetizer of chicken satay, the chicken was dry and didn't have enough sauce to make the distinct taste of chicken satay. Also, for my rad nah I would have liked it to have the noodles browned a bit more to make them crisper so they weren't soggy and the gravey just needs a bit more of a thickening agent to make it more gravey than soup.  These are just tiny things that can be over looked but I just wanted to let people know.  I do recommend Thai E-San for a quite weekday date night with your special someone.",

However, a few serve more unique dishes in addition to the classics.  Located on Indian School Road next to 3 Snaps Resale Shop, Thai E-San specializes in the regional cooking of northeastern Thailand, also known as the Issan or Esan region. It is difficult to clearly define Esan cooking since many of those native dishes, like papaya salad and larb, are common on many Thai menus. They are more about heat and sourness, as pretty much everything we tried here reflected that.  I have noticed some commonalities among Thai restaurants, including gracious service. From the time we entered the large dining room until we left, the staff was polite and attentive, not to mention gorgeous. Thai women are stunning.  Another similarity with many Thai restaurants is the sheer size of the menu. I have no idea how they can keep so many ingredients on hand to make so many dishes. If you don't mind some reading and ask lots of questions, you can learn a lot about food, cooking and, of course, eating.  Starting with the Thai E-San Special Appetizer ($12.95) lands you in the middle of a massive amount of shareable treats. Brimming with crunchy Egg Rolls, tender peanut sauce laden Chicken Satay, Wontons and a sweet and spicy Cucumber Salad, there is enough for at least three bear-sized appetites. The portions are large, so sharing is a must, which is also very Esan.  The Beef Salad ($8.95) is sliced char-grilled sirloin with chili, onion, lime juice, rice powder and fresh Thai herbs. It can be ordered with varied heat, from one, which is mild, to five, which is hot as it gets. I prefer ordering two or three, then add heat from the chile condiment jars. This dish was bold, with a nice sourness from the lime juice.  I also was excited about the Thai E-San Sausage ($10.95). It's more of a grilled savory sausage than a fermented sour or sweet sausage, with tubes stuffed with ground pork, pork skin and Thai herbs with a heavy lime flavor. The snappy crunch of each bite led to textures of the pork skin and ground meat, tender with a chewy spring.  I love Drunken Noodles, and Thai E-San's version was top notch. Also called Spicy Noodle with Basil ($8.95), there's a choice of meat or tofu that is stir fried with large wide noodles, chile, basil, bean sprouts, onions and bell peppers. Each tender noodle tastes like it was seasoned on its own with an explosion of flavor and spice.  The massive pile of Pineapple Fried Rice ($12.95) is mixed with shrimp, chicken and juicy pieces of fresh pineapple and topped with cashew nuts. It's a sensual mix of sweet, sour and salty, appealing to most, if not all, of your senses.  Thai E-San offers only a couple of desserts, Coconut Ice Cream ($3.50) and Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95). The latter offered slices of sweet ripe mango atop hot and sticky rice bathed with warm coconut milk for a great finish.  Thai E-San has almost 100 menu items, so there is plenty to keep me coming back.",

I am always craving warm, make it THAI hot, curry in the cooler months and have been on a personal mission to find JUST the right place here in the valley for THE perfect Thai cuisine. Not only the perfect Thai cuisine, but one that has all the right things : an authentic menu; good ambience that isn't 'diner-y' .. with a cold, brightly lit style of decor, great service; and a FULL bar. You would be surprised how finding THAT ONE great Thai place with all of these elements attached , hasn't been easy! Thai E-San is warm and inviting , with great service! Our waitress explained the heat factor on the dishes we ordered and made suggestions, as well. On this particular night, I was craving a Thai hot-pot style soup, initially, but ended up with the Pineapple Curry. My dish had lots of fresh veggies and chunks of fresh pineapple in a lovely green curry coconut milk; JUST what I wanted on a cold desert night! I got a two on the heat scale of one to five , and I was still in need of a tissue for my nose! ( Well! Best to know that, in case ! ) But, not to worry, as the great wait staff never let the water glass go dry. I got a side of the sticky rice for all that coconut curry goodness , so as not to waste the yummy saucy part. I coupled this with a Chardonnay and all was perfect .. I even had leftovers for the next day, as the servings--Serve! I highly recommend Thai E-San.. as I write this review, I'm suddenly craving that seafood hot pot again ... darn it and here it is closed as its late! Oh well! Maybe tomorrow, as they have a great take out menu. Just remember , if your a two to five sort , bring your tissues !",

Locate the curry section, select one of her 6 options, and enjoy what will happen to your taste buds. The owner prides herself on customer service - she has been there for over a decade and really values connecting with her customers. After the second time I went, she surprisingly recognized me and said, \"Oh no. You cannot be here otherwise you will get addicted to me.\" I was in tears of laughter and I could genuinely feel her passion for her restaurant, love of her employees, and appreciation of her customers. If you haven't been here yet, you are committing a crime and I feel like you need to make it right by trying some curry at Thai E-San. Seriously, the best curry spot in the Valley.",

We had the Pat Thai, Lemongrass soup with shrimp, papaya salad with crab, sticky rice, fish with ginger, all the food we had it to a medium spicy. Every food that we had was just perfect very flavorful they had extra spices on the side which I thought I might need to use but. ( I love spicy food ) but like I said everything was seasoned perfect!!  Being here on vacation when u see the restaurant don't we fooled by the outside. The restaurant is so clean, cute decorations, VERY attentive staff, restaurant full with business people for lunch. You know this Resturant is good!! If I live here I would come back here.  But being from Hawaii you can only come when ur on vacation. I'm gonna miss this Resturant!! Definitely going to come back when I come visit to Arizona!!",

The soup that came with the meal was fine (although it had chicken in it and the waiter didn't tell us which was not ideal for my vegetarian companion), but the rest of the meal was pretty bland. The most disappointing part of the rice dish was the beef. It tasted like a cheap cut of meat that you would find at a chain Mexican restaurant and it lacked spices. The saving grace of the dish was the pineapple, which is not typically part of the dish. Too bad, I had high hopes for this place but I probably won't be returning.",

Every time we walked in the door we always greeted with this waiter (don't know his real name) we called him \"Mongolian Beef\" (inside joke). He's always friendly and we often joke with him.   Most of the time I would start with Thai Iced Tea for drink and I did this time as well. Although I do think it is a little too sweet but it is pre-made so they can't adjust that. I love their Pineapple Fried Rice when they put the fried rice in the actual half cut emptied pineapple shell, but they don't do that anymore. So for this time I ordered a Pa-Naeng Curry (Malaysia) it has coconut milk, red chilli, & fresh Thai herbs. It tasted a lot better than it looked.",

They were so warm and welcoming and ready for us. In spite of it being busy they had a server ready waiting on us. Service was fast, food Scrumptious. Haven't had such authentic Thai food before. We were so hungry that we gobbled our food down and sat back sipping our drinks. The owner came to check if everything was ok and she didn't even rush us. She talked about her family and her history with the restaurant. At no point did we feel they wanted us to leave. Awesome awesome place. I will most definitely come back here on my next visit.   Thank you for taking care of us and for such a delightful meal.",

    "text": "It's always fun when you find that an unexpected connection to a longtime friend.  That connection can be particularly delightful when you discover that said friend has a connection to a local restaurant.  Growing up I've had friends whose families owned restaurants like Miracle Mile Deli, Luke's Sandwich Shop, Sing High and Posh just to name a few.  Nevermind how much free food that meant I got to mooch (I always offered to pay for my meal for the record).  Perhaps there's an extra trust factor when someone you know personally is running the show.  Such is the case with Thai E-San.  Pui and Rodger Pongtratic have owned this small CenPho spot since 2011 (and have run several other kitchens in the past).  I actually grew up with their daughters Jan and April, but never knew their parents owned this place.  Given the high Yelp marks and that personal connection to the Pongtratic family, it was about time for a Thai dinner here.  Located on the north side of Indian School Road just east of 7th Avenue, Thai E-San is a super relaxed space that can hold probably 70-80 people at full capacity.  You'll see more than a fair amount of Thai decor on the walls along with lots of old red leather booths (and for some reason a wall of Christmas lights even in summer?).  I got here at 5pm on a Wednesday and the dinner crowd was light, so I got a nice comfy booth to myself this go around.  The food here is Thai, but more specifically geared towards northeastern Thailand (known as Isan) with some subtle Laotian and Cambodian influences.  Truth be told I usually play it safe with Thai cuisine.  Partly because I'm a wimp when it comes to spice but partly just because I love my standard Pad Thai or Drunken Noodle dishes.  Knowing that Jan and April would probably give me tons of grief (and maybe even dead arm) for playing it safe in their own parents' establishment, I decided to go outside the usual standard Thai faire.  Fortunately, the menu labels their house specialities accordingly in case you're unsure what dishes stand out.  But first, gotta have a Thai iced tea.  Just a simple mix of tea, milk and sugar, but a nice creamy and slightly sweet drink nevertheless.  And I was gonna need it to wash down all the food I ordered.  For my app, I got the Angel Wings.  Ground pork and chicken mixed together with noodles and herbs and then fried to create a drumstick-like appearance.  The dish also comes with a cucumber sauce (I think I picked up vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, and some chilis in the sauce).  For my main entree I went with another house speciality, the Thai E-San Sausage.  FYI I believe the Thai term for this is type of sausage Sai Krok Isan.  Basically a fermented sausage with pork, rice and a mix of herbs and spices.  The entree was served with cucumber, lettuce, ginger, and peanuts.  And of course you get a healthy helping of some of that sticky rice to bring it all together.  I was caught a little of guard not only by the fact that food came out to me so quickly (less than 5 minutes), but that they brought both my app and entree out simultaneously.  Had the restaurant been full, I might've been embarrassed by the fact there was so much food put in front of me.  Not that it would've stopped me of course.  First the Angel Wings.  By themselves the wings are just okay, but the cucumber sauce was fantastic.  Dip those drumsticks into the sauce and you've got a winner for sure.  Good portions of meat on each as well.  Now for the sausage.  This was a delightful surprise.  Four big juicy links in all (pre-sliced for your convenience) that paired perfectly with the rice and the veggies that came with the dish.  I'll cop to the fact that I probably screwed up the flow as I had no idea how to eat these items together (Do you wrap the sausage in the lettuce? Do you wrap it in rice?  Both?  Neither?), but it didn't matter.  The sausage was excellent and the portion was plenty generous.  I was stuffed with no room for dessert this go around, but very satisfied with my meal.  Total cost for the app, entree, tea, tax, and tip came to about $35.  The service was incredibly friendly, super fast (I was in and out in just over a half hour), and the dishes really opened my eyes to a type of Thai cuisine I never knew existed.  Big props to Rodger and Pui for labelling their menu accordingly so I knew which items to target outside of my usual comfort zone.  Seriously, who do you know that goes to a Thai restaurant and falls in love with sausage?  You know what, on second thought, don't answer that question.",

This food was AMAZING! I had the fresh spring rolls with tofu and warm peanut sauce, and the pad see ew with broccoli, carrots and tofu. Some of the best pad see ew I've had!     Excellent, attentive service and ample parking. I dined on a Sunday during NFL playoffs and they have large TVs so its a great place to catch a game. Can't wait to go back.  Highly recommended!",

I (of course ) had checked the yelp reviews and my mouth was watering before we even made it to the car. I couldn't decide between the sweet basil, the pad Thai, the spicy green beans or the green curry. Green curry won.   I can't say how phenomenal it was. I got four out of five stars and the heat was great. The dish didn't sacrifice flavor for heat either. Possibly the best green curry I've ever had.   My friend got the crispy chicken in cream sauce which he said he dreams about. I'd never had anything like it. It was very good.   The staff was great and service fantastic. I'm so glad I live right by here. I need to try those other dishes.",

Fried rice was flavorful, spring rolls were delicious, curry was great as well. Favorite item was probably the Lemongrass soup. AMAZING! Will definitely be returning.",

For $8.99 you can choose what entree you want and you also get to pick your protein to go along with it. You also get to choose how spicy you want it to be with a level of 1-5. I ordered the royal curry which is their yellow curry. A very good yellow curry. I enjoyed the overall flavor of the curry and the chicken was moist and had good texture. The lunch special came with a small bowl of their soup of the day and it also came with 2 wonton chips and an egg roll. Service was great and you can tell that this is a family run business, which I love. Would definitely recommend this Thai place.",

However plenty for 2 of us to eat and finish.   Left happily for our flight back to the SF bay area shortly after.",

Ordered the lunch special, red curry with the combination: shrimp, pork, beef.   Portions are pretty big. The special comes with rice, soup of the day, an egg roll, and wontons.   Flavor of the food was great including the soup-Coconut Soup. I'm not sure if I was served sticky rice but defiantly was not what I expected. The main dish had an abundance of curry and good pieces of meat with only one shrimp. The curry I ordered at a 4 (1-5 spice level), had a nice kick to it would definitely try the five just because it wasn't spicy enough.   Would I come back? Maybe. Not work the $15 bucks for the lunch special. Would try the place again for a large party to order main entrees and sides to share.    A solid three stars.",

The first time I ordered there wasn't a lof of meat but it was much better the second time around. The curry sauce is delicious with the right amount of cream and spices.  Chicken Tom Kha (coconut soup) - ordered it medium spicy and while the broth was really tasty, it was too spicy for me. Next time I will go milder for sure. Definitely a treat for the tastebuds!  Staff is nice and friendly, I appreciate that they give me an accurate waiting time for take out orders depending on how busy they get (and they are often busy which means lots of people like this place as well!)

    "text": "Where do I begin with this review?   First, I visited this place with my boyfriend a couple of times earlier this year. The Thai Basil Chicken was okay. It looked like porridge on a plate with slender pieces of chicken and just large vegetables slathered on top. I ordered their tom yum soup and it was not hot temperature wise. The soup was just a little warm.   The last time I visited was by myself where I waited for over 15 minutes before the lady in the front finally took my order. It seemed important for her to collect the money for her other customers rather than take my order when I have been standing there. I finally placed my order of the Red Curry with Chicken, which came out a little heavy with excess curry and less chicken than I thought and small traces of vegetables.  Recently, I went here for lunch by myself. It did not take them long to seat me. First, they sat me in a small table which was all right. I noticed that they sat a man that came behind me who was dining alone in a bigger table. That's fine and all, but then I noticed that the waiter took his drink order and his meal order before mine. I was highly offended by this because I sat down before him, and I waited 20 minutes before they took my order. When they did take my order after a long wait, I got my food which was the same thing I got as last time: Red curry. The lunch proportions were decent and they give you a little scoop of rice for the entire bowl of curry, which is a waste because there is excess curry leftover. Not once, did any of the waiters asked if I was ok or if I needed anything else. They proceeded to ask everyone else about their meals or if the other customers needed anything else. However, I felt neglected as a patron of this restaurant. Coming from a big city like Atlanta, I am used to better and higher class, prompt service at Thai restaurants.  This restaurant failed to meet those standards. Food is subpar, and not worth the $11-$20, especially because I have had authentic Thai cuisine elsewhere. Their service is not the best, and I will not be returning here after this last visit as it was apparent by their behavior today that my money is no good to them. I'll be saving that $11-$20 thanks to their horrible customer service and overly priced, lackluster cuisine.",

They put a minimal amount of seafood and chicken in their dishes and throw in a bunch of inexpensive onion and green peppers. No beautiful, colorful, quality veggies at all. My last and final order was Thai basil with squid. Squid is not expensive but they charged me $16 for about 10 bites worth smothered in white onion and they threw in two token mushroom pieces. They looked like scraps.  To top it off The rice tasted like it had been scraped from the bottom of the cooker it was mushy with crunchy dry pieces in it. I had to toss it. I called the restaurant back.....the man that answered the phone was nice and apologetic, but said there was nothing he could do for me because he's not the manager and there wasn't going to be a manager there until Wednesday. I'm done.....never going back!",
