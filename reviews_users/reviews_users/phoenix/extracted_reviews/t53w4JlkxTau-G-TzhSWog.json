I find that I usually get the same three options because everything else is pretty much the same. Spicy tuna, tuna salad, california roll with tuna on top, etc. The las vegas roll and the shrimp roll are pretty much the only tasty items they put on there. Everything else seems to be a derivative of tuna.",

Teharu is a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. It's not ideal for groups, as you'll be sitting at a sushi bar, so just invite your significant other and go have fun! The pricing is based on the color of the plate, so you can spend as little as $1 or as much as $100, but I average about $15-$20 a visit (including tip and drink).  The quality sushi is average - don't expect anything super fresh or new to show up on the conveyor belt. It may be a great place to take a sushi newbie, as there are a TON of options they create for little cost upfront. The portion sizes are smaller too, so this may be a great chance for you to try sushi you may not have been willing to spend $15/roll on.",

Other then that they have so many different types of sushi to choose from, and if the sushi you want isn't on the moving track you can just order from the cooks. Their prices are amazing the most expensive piece of sushi is about $2.00 which I'm not sure where else you can find sushi this cheap, fresh, and yummy! I defiantly recommend this restaurant to any sushi lovers!",

The music was some terrible Billboard 100 mix. I don't know, when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97.5, I guess.   Anyway, the food was pretty terrible. I do like the conveyor belt style, since it's a cool part of eating sushi in Japan, but I feel like they didn't really pull it off. Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all. Even for the price (dirt cheap), it really wasn't worth it for SUCH a sub-par meal. The cream puffs were pretty good though, and I was really amused at the snack-paks and apple juice cartons going around too.   I've seen some reviews complaining about the service, but I thought the service was actually pretty good. Just had to signal someone to come over for the check and they were very attentive and nice, quick about getting it to us and giving my card back.  In summary, the next day there were stomachaches had by everyone we'd gone there with, so I will not be back; 2 stars for the cream puffs and the staff.",

    "text": "Sushi is great... but conveyor belt sushi is even better. I was excited to try out Teharu Sushi since I have had amazing experiences at other conveyor belt sushi joints, however as another Yelper described it, Teharu is only \"mediocre at best.\" Both the food and service fell way short of my expectations.   I came here with a couple of friends on a Friday afternoon and luckily we didn't have to wait for a table. Upon seating I began to  notice that our waiter appeared to be utterly uninterested. I was hoping the quality of food will make up for the lack of quality of service but sadly things kept going downhill. In my opinion, the sushi selection here is extremely limited. Their rolls are very basic and the size of the roll were smaller than what I was used to. They also offer other items such as cheesecake, packaged pudding, bottled juices, etc., but a conveyor belt sushi restaurant is the last place I expected to see (or purchase) those items. The sushi did not look appealing on the conveyor belt, probably because all of the plates were covered with flimsy plastic lids, which looked very old and were either ripped or cracked. I had 5 plates in total... sadly all of them were lackluster and did not taste fresh. Furthermore the sushi rice also appeared to be undercooked, it was tough and grainy instead of chewy and moist :(  When it was time to get the check, our server stood there for a good five minutes scraping the uneaten food into a plastic lid while we watched in awkward silence. And instead of dropping off the check at our table and coming back after a few minutes so we have time to get our payments ready, he stood there and waited while my friends and I rushed to dig out our money. These may be very small details but it was enough for me to conclude that 'odd' is the best way to describe the service at Teharu Sushi.  My search a good revolving sushi bar in the Valley shall continue.",

I see the best value in the Salmon or Tuna Nigiri, because it is only $1 per order.    If you preferred the americanized Las Vegas Rolls and Philly Rolls the price doubles all the way to $2.  Still a great value....  For the veterans who love sushi and eat Uni and Natto, you can order them, but they usually jump up to $3 and only made when you order them.      Yes there is conveyor belt which turns a lot of sushi snob friends off, but I don't mind.  Plus, I end up ordering directly from the sushi makers if I don't see what I want on the belt.    It isn't fine dining, but it is great value.  Service is a little rough....thus only 4 stars.  This place always seems to be understaffed.  Just be vocal and you get what you need.....  My japanese wife and I come about 1 per month and see outstanding value.  It is always busy at peak hours, so you are best to go a little before or after peak lunch or dinner times.",

Their sushi is not the greatest, but you get what you pay for, right?  If you want to try higher quality sushi, this is not the place you're looking for. They also don't have much variety, as most of the maki on the belt is some variation of California Roll with a different topping.  It's a great place for beginners who haven't had sushi before, as they probably won't have had much experience with better sushi and won't need to pay too much for just a taste.  If you are coming in during the evening, be prepared to wait a good 15 to 20 minutes before being seated. Seating is limited and the place is always packed at these times. The staff has been attentive the three times I've been here, so I have nothing to complain about.    All in all, this place is good fun! I'll definitely be a regular here.",

My friend and I went for a late lunch and politely asked to be seated at a table (which were all open) and were told that they were for large parties only and we had to sit at the (crowded) bar. We were smooshed in between two people at the bar of the conveyor belt (and I mean....almost on their freakin' laps). As we sat there, we saw that there was a party of two being seated at one table a single customer at another. We were very taken aback by this. The prices are very inexpensive, as long as you keep track of what you are pulling from the belt. Each plate is priced based upon its color. They have the \"price/color key\" in front of you at the bar. The sushi seems to come with four pieces on each plate. The fish isn't always the freshest, sometimes tasting grainy or with an overly fishy smell that comes with age. The service is lackluster, with unfriendly wait staff who clearly don't want to be there. We had to ask for our check several times and never received a drink refill. So disappointing, as the conveyor belt is a cool concept. I think I will stick to made-to-order sushi at Mikado from now on.",

Ever since I started going here the service has always been \"meh\" but that was alright because the sushi was so good and cheap. Last time I went was the straw that broke the camels back, My brother, sister and I went on a Saturday night, it was busy as usual but we didn't  mind the wait. We were seated on the second conveyer belt which had no where near as much of a selection as the main one so we ordered off the menu....15 minutes goes by, then 30, then 45, nothing. While we were waiting two different waiters came by and asked if we were waiting for our checks. When we told them we were waiting on our food they just shrugged and walked away. When some of our sushi finally did make it to our table it tasted horrible because it had been sitting out for so long! We finally gave up and got our check and left. There are other rotating  sushi places in the valley  that taste better and have better service. Hopefully they get their act together, it really used to be an amazing place :(",

It tasted good going in but no feel good coming out. Decor was nice, but location sucked as it took me a while to find it stuck behind the mcdonalds off priest. you get what you pay for at this place, rotating sushi is scary if the items get warm and they don't take it off the belt.",

    "text": "I have been to many conveyor belt sushi joints before (San Fran, Dallas, Seattle and Okinawa) and I have to give it to Teharu, they have been the cheapest yet. Cheapest isn't always the best in this case. We came in with a group of 4 including our 4 month old son and we sat in the main area right away. It was Sunday afternoon and so there was no big crowd at all. They had a pretty good selection on the conveyor belt but was shocked to see yogurt, orange juice and cheesecake among others that did not belong there. The sushi was OK but what really brings them down in my eyes was their server. While my wife was chowing down, she picked up some ginger from her plate and found hair wrapped around the ginger. We signaled to the server (younger Asian female) but she was busy tending to other guests and finally after a good 5 minutes she came to our table and we informed her of what we found. We showed her the ginger piece and without expressing concern she just says \"Oh, I'm sorry\". Grabs the plate and walks away. We simply wanted her to acknowledge the fact that yes these is HAIR wrapped around the ginger and they maybe they need to check on their products before setting them on the table. The ginger did not come from the conveyor belt but was brought out from the back. Maybe if they practiced more attention to detail, this would not have happened. We were doing the restaurant a favor by bringing it up and she had something stuck in her behind and did not care at all. It was almost like we made her mad. PLEASE stay at home if you have other issues in your life but don't bring it with you to work because you can ruin other people's day and experience from your business. Thank you but never again.",

Yes, the food was pretty cheap, but just a mile away is Mido Sushi, which is cheaper and more importantly, fresh. While at Teharu, it took over five minutes to receive one California Roll! The whole conveyor belt is cheesy, especially with all the random food they add to it including applesauce, cheesecake, jell-o, and drinks you've never heard of! The Shrimp Tempura was cold when I received it and it tasted like oil. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money here.",

Service is so-so but you basically serve yourself so its irrelevant. No plates over $2 and they have a little chart that lets you know what color is what price. I got a rainbow roll, gyoza (potstickers), shrimp tempura roll, edamame, and a cali roll for $9 inc tax. And the time I went with my bf I can't remember everything we got but we were both stuffed (and he eats a lot!) for under $20. Great place to go for quick, super cheap sushi. They also have a menu if you want to order anything not on the belt or if you don't want to sit at it. Definitely my new favorite!",

You can come here and eat all the $1 sushi you want!  Sushi is cheap. If you get $1 plates, you can spend $7 for 14 pieces of sushi. if you get the rolls, it will be more expensive. Please do not get the can of fruit or cheesecake. Those are designed for suckers.  The sushi is not premium sushi or prepared with the best technique.   But for a fun atmosphere, cheap food and this gimmick with the conveyor belt, this place hits the spot. Just don't come during dinner and you could be waiting 30 minutes to get seated. I come here because all of my friends love this place. And what's eating sushi without good friends, right? :)",

    "text": "Great place to grab some decent sushi.  It's a revolving sushi bar, so it's best if you're not in a huge group.  If you have 4+ people, they'll seat you at a booth.. otherwise, you're seated next to random people... basically wherever there is room.  Usually there is always a wait, but the wait doesn't last too long.  It's best to come at peak hours because it'll ensure that the plate you're picking off the conveyor belt is fresh.. otherwise.. who knows how long that plate has been sitting around.  Sometime I'll see the exact same plate go around in a circle the entire time I'm there. :/  They have your basics, california roll, spicy tuna, philly, hawaiian, vegas roll, nigiri pieces.. and so on! My favorite is called \"the haru\".  Basically it's imitation crab wrapped with tuna & avocado.  Yum.. I could eat a million of these and I liked it best because it had no rice to it!  The Vegas roll is also pretty good too.  If you want fresh pieces, stick with stuff like rainbow, hawaiian or the nigiri pieces.  & if you dont see something on the belt you want, just ask the sushi chefs to make it for you! That way, it's extraaaa fresh ;)  They also have kitchen food as well, but I never bothered to order any of that.  Mostly because the portions are tiny and overpriced for it.. so I just stuck with sushi :)  Prices are cheap! $1-$3 plates.. but it does add up quick because 1 plate only has a couple pieces to it.  Happy eating!",

Stop expecting to see famed Scottsman Gordon Ramsay rolling up your fish and rice back there. Come in with realistic expectations.  What Teharu is: Fun Cheap Loud (but I dig that environment sometimes) Great for groups  What it isn't: Michelin rated  Put some expectations aside, or go elsewhere. For the rest of us - We'll be smart enough to order a fresh roll via the menu (yes you can) anytime something looks questionable. It's on you, if you don't do that.

    "text": "Review update: I was a regular until I had a bad experience at night. However; that was a couple months ago. I just revisited the place around 11:00 AM for lunch and my experience was much better.   They seemed to have fired or replaced the bad staff and added fresh new people who are quick and nice to be around. They sat me down as soon as I walked in and when I asked to pay it only took 2 minutes. The food is much fresher now compared to when the old chefs still worked there and did not care much.   I might go again next month for a snack given my better experience. It is MUCH better to go during the day and not around night time.   I DO have some criticism.   1) The pop music has not changed and get's annoying after your second visit.   2) The old \"sign in\" list is really cheap. An IPad or something electronic would fit better.  3) I was let down they did not decorate for any holidays. Perhaps next year.  4) A lot of the plates, curtains and chairs need to be replaced. They are old.   The sushi is just quick food unlike a professional place. It's cheap but fills you up fast with 1/6 the price of a professional restaurant (It's more of a large sushi bar).  I hope Teharu sees this review and improves the place. They certainly have the money for it after all these people pay good money to come here.",

Most of the rolls only have one or two ingredients, and are very basic but it satisfies the sushi craving without dropping $50-60 on sushi for two. Teharu says that they're \"fine dining\" but I don't really see that. The seats at the sushi bar around the conveyor belt are very close together, and there's very few actual dining tables. I wouldn't consider any of this \"fine dining\" but to each their own, I guess. The only real con to Teharu is that their servers don't really have to serve you anything, so when you do need something they seem a bit rude. All in all, I think the super low price of food makes everything okay.   If you're a sushi snob and looking for top notch sushi, do not come here. Otherwise, if you don't really care as long as you don't get food poisoning, this is a decent place.",

Teharu may have been my very first sushi experience in the Greater Phoenix Area and the revolving bar novelty had me hooked immediately. The solid sushi quality and constant mission to make a plate stack reach the high heavens kept me coming back all through high school as a cheaper alternative to places like Mido. I'm talking near weekly visits -- would not be surprised if you could catch my ugly mug multiple times in the pictures of satisfied customers plastered on the walls.  During my recent visit to Teharu, I was surprised to find it busy as ever especially after hearing about it kind of drop the ball over the last four years. The revolving resto hype and novelty is definitely still reeling people in. After a solidly long wait to be seated, we grabbed a few passing plates to find that the sushi was indeed on the decline, a few rungs shy of mediocre. Definitely lacking in freshness, which is concerning considering we saw the plates hit the belts not 30 seconds before we nabbed them. We each had maybe 3 plates max before calling it quits and opting for a drive thru burger elsewhere to hold us over.  Holding out hope for some inspired culinary comeback story, but til then will probably aim to hit up the spread of other sushi joints in the Valley.",

Most of the rolls are just sashimi on top of California rolls. It is a good place to go with a small group and sushi newbies since everyone can get what they want and try a lot of different sushi without breaking the bank. My favorite thing to get is the Salmon nigri, you get two good sized pieces for only $1. I wouldn't recommend the sashimi plate since you don't get as much as with the nigri.   Depending on what time you go there is sometimes a 15-20min wait.",

    "text": "My two cousins and I went to Teharu as a last minute decision.  The plus side is that the sushi is inexpensive and it was delicious.  This restaurant serves the sushi rolls and apps conveyor belt style.  This means you are choosing various plates of sushi which are color-coded by the plates and those colors correspond to pricing.  the plates of sushi have lids on them so that (hopefully) germs are not attaching to the rolls as they roll by people in the restaurant.  One major issue that I did NOT like was that our table was not bussed throughout the evening.  We had piles of plates and lids and straws laying on the table.  I tried to pile things so that we had room to eat but I cannot stand having so much dirty things on the table while eating.  Last, as a seasoned sushi eater, I would suggest being picky about the rolls that you do choose.  I would have also appreciated more nigiri, but I don't think you are able to order sushi?  Or maybe you are but they don't tell you and they don't give you a sushi sheet.  Regardless, it was a fun last minute excursion and dinner place.",

The sushi is mediocre at best. It's a conveyor belt style so you get what you pay for. I tried ordering off the menu some nigiri and clearly it wasnt fresh considering they served it to me about 30 seconds after I odered. When your order nigiri it comes in 2 pieces on the same plate (priced on the menu as 2 pieces) but they serve you an empty plate under the sushi place which establishes you had two pieces of nigiri. Not understanding why they served me and extra plate under the nigiri I put it aside. They charged me for the 2 pieces of nigiri and they extra empty plate. When I asked why I was double charged they said they only charge the top plate. This was very confusing and not worth arguing the extra 3 dollars. In the end there are way better sushi places. I recommend seskan, sushi & cocktails, ahi revolving sushi, and ninja sushi. Cheers! Happy eating!",

At some point and time they started counting on quantity over quality. The portions got smaller and smaller, to the point where I went this evening and the salmon was literally paper thin. So essentially prices are the same but you get less. What?!  Service was not great as it felt like it was understaffed (big difference from the first time I went there).  The worst thing was the cleanliness. Tonight was the first time that I saw plates on the conveyor belt without covers on them, which was a big gross out factor for me.  I will not be going back until they fix the quality of the food and the service to the old standards of the past.",

I came in an was greeted an seated as soon as I came in. I was alone this time so makes sense. My waiter was very pleasant and super happy. I came in for some sashimi so he took my order and gave it to the guys behind the bar. It took a little time to get my things but nothing to bad.   During my wait I was attended by my waiter and this other guy who was running around helping other customers. When he came by he asked if I wanted to order something since I wasn't taking anything off the belt. I told him I had an order coming and he went to check on it. I thought it was nice that they were actually checking in on me.   My food came by soon after and it was as good anything else I get here. The price was great and my waiter came to refill my drinks again and checked to see if I wanted to get anything else.  Overall I had a very nice time. The service was MUCH more pleasant and enjoyable compared to the last few times.  Only word of improvement I can offer was when I recieved my food I had like a stack of 3 plates for each order (which was 3) nine plates all over the place. Little bit of a mess. Since I ordered on one of those sheets I figured they coud have just charged me by that instead of all the plates. Although that is the norm of how they charge there so I should've have expected it.",

We went fairly early on a Sat (5:30 ish) and there were probably 15 people waiting for a spot. We didn't wait too long though, maybe 15-20 min. After being seated, you can begin eating immediately... well, as soon as something you like comes around the belt. There is a small sign before a series of plates with the name of what is on the plates- I wish it also had a small description since there were a few things that I wasn't familiar with and couldn't find online (mountain potato roll... tasty, but I have no idea what was in it). I liked that each plate only has 4 or so pieces, allowing you to try many different items and minimizes the risk of trying new things. Additionally, their prices are very reasonable, with no plates costing more than 2$. We enjoyed the mtn potato roll, the seared tuna, gyoza, inari, asparagus rolls, cream puffs (yuuuummm)... most everything. The edamame was kind of a waste... not salted, with some pods empty when we got them. Additionally, we didn't care for the vegas roll. Overall, we really enjoyed this place and would come back if we were in the neighborhood.",

Also looks like a great place to bring kids. There were several families and the kids were having a blast watching the options go by and guessing what was what.  The only semi-negative was that even on a Tuesday, the wait was about 25 minutes.

I've been craving sushi the past couple of weeks!  So on our way to the restaurant when someone says, \"is this the place where the sushi is on a conveyor belt?\" In my head, I was like, \"Yay! revolving sushi!\" I haven't had revolving sushi since last year while in HI. Interestingly enough, one of my co-workers commented on how he's never been or even heard of revolving sushi before. I shared with the guys that it really isn't anything new. It was a huge trend in the late 90s and  then it faded out only for it to be the in thing couple of years ago.  I even told the guys, for us residing in Vegas and Vegas being such a foodie destination, I'm surprised there aren't any in Vegas.  So I'm excited because I'm so looking forward to get a crunch roll!   We get to the restaurant at about 11:15 am and the restaurant is already packed. For some reason, they only opened up half of the restaurant so we had to split up for lunch, 4 on a table way in the back and two that just opened up at the counter. Of course, I want to be at the counter!  So I get my usual seaweed salad and gyoza and two other sushi dishes as I patiently waited for the shrimp crunch roll which disappointingly never came :(  I guess I'm spoiled and asking for too much?  Good customer service, okay sushi, disappointed there was no shrimp tempura options.",

I saw so many rolls go around and around their tracks that weren't getting eaten, therefore, just sitting out in the open {with lids for germ protection} and not refrigerated. With the mayo, fish, etc. on the rolls this made me so nervous!   How it works:  They have a variety of different sushi, rolls, edamame, cucumber salad, desserts, drinks, pot stickers, etc. rotating around a huge bar-type setup. Each item is on a colored plate and the color associates it with the price. The prices were $1, $1.50, and $2 depending on which plates you grab. Then, at the end the waitresses add up your plates to determine your bill. While service is extremely quick because you simply just grab what you want, I believe that as a result, the freshness goes out the window. Out of the few rolls that I tried, they were all pretty fishy and warm. My pet peeve is warm sushi! It has gotta be COLD! I ended up sticking with the cucumber salad, pot stickers, and edamame to play it safe.   The scariest part for me was that some of the items literally looked like plastic. The crab was 100% artificial and looked that way. Yikes, it just freaked me out.   That said, I won't be back but if you aren't super picky about the quality of your seafood/sushi and want a quick, cheap sushi fix, I can see how Teharu could be a great place to go.",

The toppings are all over the place instead of being placed nice and neat. This was by far the worst Teharu experience I've had and will not be returning to this specific Teharu.

It was part of the unspoken agreement: you sell me decent salmon nigiri for $1.50 a plate, and I overlook the fact that the male servers always make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them by trying to eat here and that half the things I order never actually make it to my table. But it turns out there is a limit to what I'll endure for cheap and fast sushi after all.   I arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night and was largely ignored, which was pretty much par for the course. What irritated me this time in particular was that about 15 minutes in, I finally had to get up and get an order sheet for myself because the servers were painstakingly avoiding eye contact with the customers at all costs. To add insult to injury, they started clearing tables. I had to I guess we looked like we weren't going to use any? I assumed they were about to close, but then discovered that they were in fact open until 10:30.  Long story short, if you really like California rolls and don't mind being treated like crap, this is probably an excellent restaurant for a casual dinner with people you don't mind sitting around, not eating with.",

Didn't feel like driving to North Scottsdale so I went to this location for the very first time.  The quality of the rolls was much shoddier (loosely rolled, far too much rice, not sliced all the way through for clean separation) and there was no organization to the rolls on the conveyor belt. The assortment was also much more sparse--about half of the assortment that North Scottsdale has. The only nigiri they had was Hokkigai and Hamachi; there was no ahi, salmon, unagi, etc.   I will have to time my Teharu fixes for when I go to North Scottsdale.",

The prices for the sushi is pretty reasonable. I got a crunch roll, shrimp tempura roll, bake scallop roll, and baked mussels. The baked scallop and baked mussels were special orders you have to tell the waiter and it was well worth it for me because I ordered a few of them and they were delicious!!  The customer service was pretty good and they were nice and polite. A downside I can think of is that their revolving sushi is usually bigger. So, I don't know if it's because it was a weekday and maybe there are bigger parties on the weekend. Overall, I liked it, not a bad place to bring a date.

It seems as though most of the servers are still here, as well as some of the \"cooks.\" If you ask for anything special like you would at a normal sushi resturant they have a bad attitude. If there is a dish that is supposed to be warm and u ask for a fresh one they grab it off the conveyor belt. The last few times they have produced so much of the food that way it can last for two or three hours... it's sushi and it's supposed to be fresh...",

We ate a moderate amount with 2 bottles of diet coke and tip for about $25. We could have ate more, but we were full!   The bathrooms were a mess! That is why they only get 4 stars from me. Toilet paper was not mounted (just sitting on counter). I actually felt dirtier coming out! Anyways, fantastic food! Go!",

I touched the other piece and the same slim. It was also a little warm.  Not good.  I did not get sick, but worried about it for hours.   The place was almost empty at lunch time.  Humm, why?

We decided to go back today for a late lunch 2:30-3:00pm and it was a totally different place.  The food was all old. The cold plates were room temperature, and the hot plates were cold. None of the items were being restocked, and it was the most popular items that were gone (edamame, Cali roll, pot stickers). We waited for the whole rotation to go by a couple times before asking when they would be refilling it, the waitress literally walked away with no answer. Nothing.  There was another woman asking if the desert items would be coming, deserts never came.  As we were leaving with disappointment the chef came out of the back where it looked as if he were sleeping.  I will return to this location for dinner only. Never again for lunch.",

I had plenty of seating next to me that would fit my family so I didn't worry but once someone sat down I told another one of the host/server that I had my family coming he simply said no. I was blown away by his response my family and I had made a special trip to visit this cool conveyor sushi restaurant and come to find out I could have gotten better service at jack n box.  I tried talking to a manager when when I spoke to one of the girls in Spanish she confided in me that the owners are just as bad just as rude and are quick to kick people out if the restaurant isn't full.",

We are having sooo much fun trying independent places instead of big chains; we are discovering a new world of great places right here within a few miles of us...  Based on what others say, I think we made a good decision in going when Teharu is busy, a Friday night. 2 of us waited about 15-20 mins for seats, which was fine. Because they were so busy, all of the sushi we had off the belt was fresh & delicious, lots of variety. It's not super high-end gourmet sushi, but we didn't expect that from a volume revolving place. A nearby diner ordered special custom items & said he's happy every time & that the staff is wonderful about special requests. He also says the variety is constant, regardless of traffic flow.  We tried a bunch of different things. We like the belt, as we branch out from menus; \"What the heck? It's $1.50/$2, let's try one!\" Although of course personal preference plays into it, all were really good in flavor & quality. I had plenty & my teen stuffed himself (that means a lot of plates), plus a soda & a $4 big asian beer, all totaled about $24. WOW.",

I'm disgusted my friend spits his food out I wave down server and she comes and kills roach and then says no worries we just got sprayed because or bug problem. I ask to speak to manager and manger tells me they have bad roach problem and will have them come spray again tomorrow because they just Sprayed today. What made it so bad was that it seemed so normal that they have roaches running around on the conveyer belt. I will never go back that is unhealthy and a disease waiting to happen",

You wait for a seat at the sushi bar by signing your name in a notebook at the door, which means no person greets you.  The food is below average and extremely unappetizing in view.  Very limited selections and tons of the same stuff comes around and around.  The prices are low and if you like sub par sushi, it is better than mass produced sushi at the grocery store.  In all fairness, the 3 servers were handling a full restaurant.  I may try again as it is cheap and two items I had were ok, but I would not venture too far on the menu.",

We order drinks and start. Make sure you order everything you need because the waitstaff kind of forget about you after the initial contact.  The sushi is very mediocre, some rolls are good but are drowned in sauce. Most rolls are variants of the California roll.

The novelty of this place is that you get your sushi for a revolving conveyer belt! And they've spaced is so that it goes throughout the restaurant. Good for allowing people seated at booths to also access the belt, bad for if you want a certain type of sushi and need to wait for it to roll all the way around again...  I will say upfront that the quality is not the best. And over the years, I think the rolls have gotten smaller... And sometimes you don't know how long those rolls have been sitting out on the conveyer belt, waiting for someone to take them. On the plus side, the popular rolls are replenished quite frequently so those are always freshly made. You can even order from the chefs if there's something you want that's not on the belt.   And the prices can't be beat! From $1 for the cheapest, and $2 for the most expensive, the sushi comes on plates of 2-4 rolls. This is probably the best bang for your buck if you want to try a variety of different rolls. I always end up getting full on less than $10, which is pretty cheap for sushi!",

    "text": "This place is cheap, and I'm talking Fred Mertz cheap.  In fact, while I'm in the ballpark of I Love Lucy, let's recall the chocolate factory episode where Ethel and Lucy are shoveling chocolates into their mouths.  That's basically what goes down when I walk through the door in this place.  \"Pick that plate up, I wanna try that!\"  Even if I don't like it, I'm out what, $1.50?  I've lost more trying to get the mini Rubik's Cube key chain out of the 50 cent machine at the grocery store, and I've yet to leave the grocery store with the victory key chain.  Teharu is a bit uncomfortable at first, especially when you see that the conveyor goes behind a wall where who-knows-what happens, but can you really justify that discomfort whilst stuffing your face with raw fish?  Sushi lovers have all had bad sushi and it's really never as bad as you imagined it, so what's a sneeze or two on a roll (if that's the case)?  Honestly, you can't beat the prices for the quality of the food here.  No, we're not talking 5 star sushi, but definitely a good place to satisfy a sushi craving when your pockets are light.    It's also a decent place for a first date since the atmosphere refuses any awkward silences.  You're guaranteed to either be seated next  to the chick posting and filtering every roll on Instagram (that's me), or the old man asking his grandchildren what the hell the orange stuff is on top of the food and how can they eat that Asian hot sauce.   Just don't evoke your inner rudeness and reach across your neighbors... it's happened.  I've never had a bad experience here or spent more than $20 eating more sushi here than any human should be allowed to consume at any given time.  Sure, sometimes you get a roll with a texture that is the equivalent of blow-out-tire-debris on the highway, but again, we're talking color-coded plates to mark prices that don't exceed $5... for sushi.  And sometimes for canned fruit cocktail, which most likely the old man will be eating after he realizes what the orange stuff is.  A coffin is the only thing that could prevent my patronage here, especially after my bills and rent are paid but my stomach says \"gimme something fancier than Kraft\".  Decent sushi for a decent price.",

These conveyor places put out a lot of product all at once, so naturally they aren't going to use the top-shelf stuff...it's cheap, basic, dry, whatever fish and rice. The Tempura here is junk, it's all breading and no meat or vegetables, by far the worst tempura I've had in a long time. I can usually polish off a tempura plate even if it's average, but I gave up after 2 or 3 pieces, no thank you. The sashimi pieces are dry and room temperature..not even slightly chilled, and that really ruins it. Sashimi is supposed to be served fresh and COLD not 70 degrees and dry.  The service was slow and it took forever to get a first water, refills took a while too, and when we were seated we got no menus, it was pretty much a \"sit here, shut up, eat, leave\" routine. You can tell the staff never learned any hospitality skills. The overall setting is odd, there is the main half of the restaurant where everyone will be surrounding a conveyer, but the other half of the dining room is empty and bare. There is also a huge wait, at least 20-30 people were sitting there waiting for a spot to open up...yet there's a whole other side of the restaurant with an empty conveyor being unused...why not open it up? I don't get it.  Average, meh, whatever fish and rice, and terrible tempura that's really all there is to it. The one plus is that it's cheap for 1 or 2 people to grab a quick bite, other than that it's not worth remembering or going back. It's MEH at best. A week or so after eating here I read yelp reviews and saw how many health violations this place had, I felt lucky nothing got me and my party sick! Won't be returning. Go down to the street to RA or something.",

For top rolls definitely get their las vegas roll fresh out of the oven or the baked scallop roll. Their philly roll is pretty decent as well. They do have a menu you can order from which is great for those kids who are picky eaters. They even have chocolate milk and fruit cups for them. You can make reservations just do it a good amount of time in advance. The service can be slow sometimes so it's great that you can serve yourself. Just grab a plate and once your done stack them. Make sure you flag down an employee when you want your bill. This place also makes it easy to seperate bills at the table. If you want rolls fast just ask the sushi chefs when you can since most of the time you sit in front of them. Overall just test out as many rolls as you want because it's cheap and not so bad.

The service is always good, fast and friendly. Its clean and usually seated quickly (they can get really busy--a clue to the quality--so peak hours can cause a small wait).

Teharu greets you with a large conveyor belt filled with a colorful variety of sushi. From California rolls, to tuna, to las vegas, to edamame--teharu sushi has it all and all of it is fresh! They have several staff in the center of the conveyor belt preparing new sushi every few minutes! If you see something on the menu that you haven't seen come acrosd the conveyor belt they can make it for you.   I love that their plates are color codded so you can easily see how much each plate is and how much money you are spending--which probably is not much. I usually spend no more than $10- $12 and I am stuffed. But, be warned sushi does not last in your stomach long, so be prepared to take some take out with you! They have a full menu filled with not only sishi, but a variety of teriyaki and rice dishes.  This will continue to be my go to sushi spot whenever I am in AZ!!!",

    "text": "I came with a group of 4 at around 11am on a Friday, it was a full house but luckily people were leaving so we got seated almost immediately. It took around five minutes for a server to approach the table and give us plates and water. Then another 10 minutes for her to grab our order sheet. About 30 minutes after the paper was taken for our order to come out even though it was all sushi and sashimi pieces and most of the restaurant had already emptied out. Obviously service could be improved significantly, we were kind of irritated by the wait time. The waiters were more concerned about bussing tables than taking our order. It was also hard to catch a servers attention for more water.   I'm giving this place a 3 because it is pretty cheap -plates are $1, $1.50, $2 and the sushi isn't too bad.   The revolving sushi bar is fun to look at and it's exciting when you do see something you like and grab it. However, most of the items on it are not desirable like a fried onion roll (what?) and a lot of imitation crab rolls, a lot of drinks, and peach cups. There's almost never sashimi or sushi pieces on it.   The paper menu is pretty extensive so most of what you get should be from there. The fish isn't the freshest but pretty good considering it's pretty cheap for such large cuts of fish. Each sushi piece and roll however had WAY too much rice, as if they want you to get full faster. The unagi (eel) was good, white tuna was pretty yummy, and salmon was delicious. The sweet shrimp was also surprisingly not bad. I wanted to try uni but they didn't have it that day. The rolls don't have descriptions on them, I blindly ordered a dragon roll which is basically an imitation crab roll with unagi on top.  Red snapper (white fish) was only $1, it's so cheap it's kind of scary! Haha, overall, a fun experience and pretty cheap. We ordered a lot and the total was only $80 including a 20% tip. Would have been 4/5 stars if the service wasn't so slow.",

Not sure if she is the manager (older Asian lady with glasses) the sushi chefs and other servers give good hospitality and service. Almost every time  we go and we go FREQUENTLY the manager lady rushes our service and makes us feel very uncomfortable. This has been one of the only places I actually asked for management to speak about her discrimination towards us. Anyways the sushi is bomb! My favorite is the HARU POPPERS! My lady loves the mussels! We will not stop coming here although the manager lady is very rude. (Might catch these hands if she's rude to my family again lol just kidding!!!!) but I hate rude service!! Happy Yelping",

One of the conveyor belts was out of order so I was sat, by a server, up at the bar.  I watched the chef, whom I don't think was an actual chef, slop roll after roll together like she was trying to fold fitted sheets - everything looked loose and sloppy.  As the rolls belted by me I saw little variety compared to some of the other locations I've been to.  I chose the squid salad which was actually awesome.  I then chose a rainbow roll.  Oof.  It was bland and the roll itself was actually warm.  Like it was sitting out far too long. Gross.  I wasn't sure I wanted more but decided to dare myself to eat another roll.  I can't even remember what it was but it was more rice than anything, falling apart and straight up tasted like I ate a spoonful of mayonnaise with each piece. I felt my stomach give me the middle finger.  I didn't finish it.  I paid, I left. I won't go to this location again.  I didn't get sick but maybe the health department should take a gander in there.",

The best thing about this place, in our opinion, is the price. Yes, this is sushi for the masses.  However, everything my girlfriend (who is a regular and loyal patron) and I ordered was good. Considering that we selected a total of ten items, including Shaggy Dog, Hawaiian Roll, Baked California Roll, Caterpillar Roll, and Salmon Lover's Roll, our check was just a little more than $20 for the two of us. Great lunch spot for sushi. We will definitely be returning.  Photo design by Billie Z.",

When she found that I had a bottle of siracha in front of me she freaked out asking me why I had this. Told her she was nowhere to be found and if she was doing her job I wouldn't have had to get it on my own. She proceeded to grab the bottle of siracha from me without asking if I needed anymore.

    "text": "It's been several years so I feel the need to update my review. This is a restaurant that you come to solely for the cheap prices and the ok food. You do not walk in expecting good service or management  so when you do get it, you are pleasantly surprised.   The servers here have more bad days than good days and it's usually reflected in their service and attitude. I think they work long hours and they probably don't get the best tips so their morale is probably kind of low. But they try, I could see them trying at today's visit for the most part.  Some ways to get around this problem is to ask for everything you want the second you are seated, if you are a single Diner ask for two waters instead of just one since refills will be slow to come by usually. Ask for more napkins and wasabi Etc. Getting all these things in the beginning will lower your annoyances later.  The food: You are getting better than supermarket sushi but lower than a regular style sushi restaurant. If you don't want to wait for the conveyor belt, order straight from the chef. I was there for at least 30 minutes and did not see one tiger roll which was a shame because I'm pregnant and most of things that were served had raw fish in them.( I'm not generally a pregnancy food follower but I know enough to not go Raw here. I'll gladly eat the shit out of some Sashimi @ Kabuki though) anyways I could have ordered it from the chef but I really just didn't care too so that's on me.  Some things are just ridiculous like how they don't have enough bowls of ginger per seating, so expect you ask your neighbor for some of theirs.  All in all:  This is a convenient fast food sushi joint that can be enjoyable if you just overlook its quirks- they haven't changed in the years that they have been around -they are not going to change how they run things now. All you can do is change your expectations and just be glad there aren't any roaches running around anymore.",

    "text": "Someone told me about this place a long time ago but I'd never gotten around to actually going until this week.  To my surprise it's only about 2 blocks away from where I work too!  The seating kinda sucks, especially if you have more than two people.  I was with a group of four and instead of having bar top style seating where everyone is facing the conveyer belt so that they can grab their own stuff, they have actual tables where only two of the four seats are next to the conveyer.  Therefore the people on the outside have to either reach in front of the other people or constantly be asking for stuff to be grabbed for them.  Not ideal.  The sushi itself I would put at average at best.  Everything had a general temperature of lukewarm whether it was something that should have been cold or hot, one of the downfalls of this system I guess.  I will say the cream puffs were delicious though, but really who goes to a sushi place for cream puffs?  The service wasn't great either and I mean I guess that's another flaw in this kind of system, your food comes on the constantly moving belt but trying to get your drinks refilled or get the check was a little bit of a hassle.  Basically I think this is a cool place to come for the experience but this is not a place I would go to when I want some good sushi.",

If you get rolls, there are usually about 4 pieces on one plate.  Larger rolls such as the Las Vegas Roll (which is deep fried) will come as 3 pieces.  They have the usual suspects of sushi: salmon, maguro, yellowtail, bbq eel, as well as octopus, squid, and the uncommon conch (which was too rubbery and tasteless for me).  As well as sushi, you can find ramune soda, pudding cups, orange juice, and various desserts.  They had cream puffs and cheesecake for today's dessert.  Our total for 2 people with sodas was ~23 dollars, not bad for a sushi dinner!  P.S.  If you order soda ($1.75), it comes in a prepackaged plastic bottle so no unlimited refills, but it will give you ~2 drink cup's worth.",

    "text": "Teharu is fairly unique in that it's the only conveyor belt sushi restaurant that I know of in the Valley. I think there has been one in the works in Cityscape for some time, but it's been in the works for like... 1 year and a half at this point. :P So I'm not holding my breath.   For the uninitiated, this place is exactly what it sounds like- a conveyor belt sushi place. You go in, wait to be seated- if your party's not too big you'll be seated by the bar. Two rows of conveyor belts wind about in front of you, along which parades an near endless row of sushi. Mmmm. They're on color coded plates, kept hygenic with little plastic covers on top. Just reach out and take what you want! It's as simple as that. Make room to stack your plates up, because that's how they charge you.   This place is almost always somewhat busy, which I think speaks to the fact that this is a pretty decent little place. It's not the most amazing sushi, nor is it the cheapest. But it's pretty darn cost efficient, and for the price you pay you can get a lot of bang for your buck. And for those worried about freshness, the turnover is pretty good. Good enough that their tempura is still hot and crispy (not soggy), their rolls fresh, and their gyoza hot and succulent. My husband and I much prefer this place to the all-you-can-eat sushi buffet not far from this location. Mostly because for the price of one person at the all you can eat sushi we pretty much eat as much as we want at Teharu, and emerge pleasantly full. (Not like I can't eat any more sushi for a year, which is quite the statement if you know me.)   Definitely worth dropping by if you're in the area. It's not something I would go out of my way to get to, but if were in the area I try to go. I do like to joke though that it's not a good first date place. I don't know about y'all, but I wouldn't be watching my date. I'd be watching the little row of marching sushi plates, trying to catch sight of what I want to snag next!",

I asked for water twice because I waited 6 minutes after the first time before anyone even walked by the table again. If they are busy enough to need to turn their tables quickly, then why does it take 5-10 minutes for a water? When someone asks for a drink after the initial first drink order has arrived, it's probably that they're thirsty. So now I can't eat anymore until I have something to wash it down, therefore I am taking more time that someone else has to sit and wait. Get it together.  Oh, my daughter also had a hair in her sushi. Not as pertinent but still worth mentioning. If the service staff could brighten up and smile a bit more, and be a little faster when someone is thirsty they would get at least 4 stars. So management, don't ruin what a good thing you have!

So basically my daughter who is 3 was sitting on the counter and Jenny polietly told her to get down and sit on the chair, which was fine. What wasn't ok was when she looked at my sister in law and said \"oh don't look at me like that I wasn't rude to you\"...not cool, she also looked like completely troubled to get me two Waters like it's such a burden to do your job. My wife and I always tip well. And that is not how you get a good tip. Another thing she complained about to my wife was how my brother in law wanted water and my wife asked about another water and then she said snobbily said that she didn't have room enough on her plate to carry it. And the entire interaction was very rude. From here were going to come back but if the service doesn't improve then we're going to have some pretty bad words to the management the servers and everything. Like seriously the restaurant could be so much better if you were just a little nicer. This isnt Japan. You want tips.

I don't eat fish so I ordered the avacodo rolls and the avocado was very soft and perfect, I also ordered the Inari which I recommend for kids, It's a tofu pouch with rice inside. It was a little hard to understand the servers when we tried asking what was in the fried onion roll. This was a good experience and I look forward to coming back!",

    "text": "My friends suggested we try this place for sushi. This is one of the worst sushi establishments I've ever been to. First the waitress sat us in the way back And she didn't even hand us a menu!! The only reason I knew was because the ppl beside us started ordering off menu items.  Second the sushi did not look fresh the mayo was turning a different color and not many choices. Also on the conveyor belt were weird items like juice boxes and random stuff that looked like they took stuff out of the fridge...the only pro is that their plates are cheap. But I rather pay for higher quality & a better experience",

But, yeah, people came in groups! I was surprised at the number of large parties, which is just as well. Teharu, in addition to sushi bar seating, is mostly table and booth seating.   As for the food, I found that the fish was fresh and the rice was decent. My favorites were the mackerel and salmon nigiri. But, sadly, I did not overly enjoy the rolls. They were not bland, but they also were not overly flavorful. Also, the wine selection is very short and also not very interesting.   But, in all, a very good price for dinner.",

    "text": "I love this place. The food is reasonably priced and delicious but the service IS THE WORST! It took 40 min for my shrimp tampura to come out and when I asked if she had put my order in she said she forgot with a quick \"sorry!\" Before running away. The food line doesn't have as much variety as it used to ! I order ebi's that are rarely added to the rotation. They no longer serve taco's  . The whole place gives the overall impression of not being organized. You have waiters literally running from one end of the building to another  dropping things shouting at other waiters and the cooks from across the floor. Basically any time we need anything it's a hassle to get without waving someone down and waiting an extra 15-25 min. The person who sits you down isn't the waiter don't be fooled! They won't come check on you or refill your beverages. But besides the big negative the food is good and at such a great price. My boyfriend waited 30min for his food that never arrived and when I asked to speak to a manager the manager told me there was nothing he can do and the price of the meals remained. No discounts or anything and when I told him how upset we were he said \"everyone is in the same boat and waiting long times\" as if that made it okay..... not too mention we waited 30-40 min to be seated in the first place. No remorse NO APOLOGY And he didn't even look at me while having this conversation. I understand you can be busy but in the cs food industry number one rule is BE TENTATIVE. It was so shocking that he did not care even the slightest bit that our experience was one of the worst we've ever had. In total customers are seated and forgotten  and the manager clearly has no professional respect for the customers that provide his paycheck and the waiters don't get tipped due to their lack of CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'm not a massive complainer only when it surpasses the usual. This place was a HUGE disappointment over and over again. NEVER COMING BACK AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT unless you have a couple hours to spend WAITING.  We do however LOVE the Superstition location. Waiters stop by and check on multiple times. They provide and actually done in restaurant experience and the food is also high quality for the price you pay. It's a bit more expensive the honestly the customer service makes it worth it.   Customer service here SUCKS. And so does the managers",

It's a great place to get \"discount sushi.\" I've been visiting here for years now and I've seen some great improvements--the music that used to blaring loud is now reduced and the overall hygiene of the restaurant has seemed to improve. The Haru poppers here are amazing and is the first thing I order every time.  The service, however, can be improved. Some servers are respectful but others barely speak or smile at you, and just don't look at all happy. Overall, I like this place a lot and the prices are great for college students.",

Don't go when it's busy its such a nightmare getting a seat or service.   I've been coming to this place for years, the west side is rarely open so seating is a bit of a hassle, and when it is open the selection of sushi is different from the main side (which has he sushi chefs right in front of them).   Still one of my favorite places to to go for lunch or dinner, i recommend the squid salad or the teharu roll",

Going in it was really busy! Which I expected on a Friday night. I liked that the sushi on the conveyor had lids on them not like back home. The prices were hella cheap and I must say the portion size was a good deal for the price, comparison to genki sushi price and portion! That was a big plus for me. I liked the hawaiian roll! If you're an ahi fan you must get it! The rainbow roll is also Yums!  The only downfall which lacked my 5 star rating was the service:/ I didn't get everything that was on my list which they give you at the start to check mark what you want. Also all night they didn't refill our water. I had to share with my boyfriend! No one came to ask if we needed anything and I felt as if I needed a buzzer just to get the waiters attention! So glad we had our sake bombs to keep us occupied. I understand it was busy, but I think they need a better system or more workers to care for everyone's needs.   Overall I would still go back! The sevice just needs working on!",

Quick, easy, good for everyone-including kids (there's pudding, cheesecake, apple juice, california rolls, etc) rolling alongside the crunch rolls, spicy yellowtail, rainbow rolls, spicy tuna, philly rolls, and tiger rolls. Rolls range in price from $1-2/plate. You can choose to sit at the sushi bar if you're solo or they also have tables that accommodate about 4-6 people. Parties over that and chances are you'll have to be split up. Every time I've been here, the sushi's been great, I've stayed away from the octopus stuff though, looks creepy. The only issue I ever had was when I snagged the steamed clams from the belt and they were cold. I think they wised up on that because I never see them anymore. You can also order special rolls on the spot. My absolute favorites are the rainbow roll, tiger roll, and crunch roll! I've been here more than a handful of times and will continue coming back to get my sushi fix!",

The good thing about it being busy is fresh sushi but the downside is waiting forever to get those rolls. If you can't find what you want you can always order it which is nice. I think the prices are decent, most plates are $1.5-$2 for 4 pieces of sushi. Do not go there on a Sunday night... I feel like that is when the sushi looks like it has been sitting out for awhile. I won't say it is the greatest sushi but for the price it is just fine. I do love the \"harupoppers\" though but I'm not sure if those count as sushi.",

We are lovers of Sushi!  What I really like is the fact you can sit down and immediately start eating.  No waiting once you are seated.  BIG fan of the Conveyor Belt. The Prices are really good.  I mean really good. $1.00 to $2.00 per plate.  Rainbow rolls my husband's favorite... I LOVE the Haru Sushi. It is crab with fresh Ahi wrapped around it and a slice of avocado.  Melts in your mouth.  Yummy!!  The green Chile stuffed Poppers are to die for. Don't remember what it is called.  Don't see what you want.. Just ask and they will make it for you!  We get out of there stuffed for $20.00.  Even with a large Kirin Beer.  The staff is friendly and come around for drink orders but it is pretty much serve yourself.  It is a busy place they are constantly putting out fresh plates.  No need to be concerned on freshness.  And again they will make it fresh to order. We are fans and this has become our new favorite place for Sushi!",

Didn't get to try any of the salads, but the seaweed salad looked phenomenal.  We weren't given plates to lay our chopsticks on, so we grabbed some empty ones from the conveyor belt as it was hard (being in the corner booth) to get anyone's attention.  They turned OFF the conveyor belt while we were still sitting and munching at our table so a waitress finally walked over and said that if we needed anything to go through her.  Then she disappeared, walking throughout the restaurant.  She was nice....but never came back to us, until we asked for our bill then she got a little bit snotty with *why did we take the plates off the conveyor belt*.    Because we were never given any plates to put our chopsticks on and we didn't want to just lay them on the table or on the dirty plates.  So, they were a little miffy about it since there were drinks or snacks that we could have been charged for (but again, any *normal* person would notice there was an empty snack/soda/juice container on the table to correspond with the empty plate--duh).    I can see how this place would fill up fast and could get insanely crowded.  I just didn't like the fact that they TURNED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT while we were still sitting and eating--that's a sure sign of them not so subtly saying \"Please leave\".  Really felt like they tried to rush the two last tables on that side of the room OUT the door so they could clean and close up that portion of the restaurant.  I didn't enjoy that.    IT was a little bit loud in there--reminded me of 90's pop rock sung in Japanese--cute, but annoying.  Definitely could have been turned WAY DOWN.",

    "text": "For the longest time I've had my friend Tiffany tell me all about this sushi bar called Teharu that sits right next to NYPD Pizza, at the intersection of Priest and 48th Street. It seemed like a good place for a fun dinner, and I've always been one to open up my appetite to new places, so I gave in on my friend's requests to go. Teharu was fairly close and I wasn't really going out of my way to try this new place. The location was about three or four miles away from where I live, give or take a few miles.   When we got there, the exterior of the restaurant looked very plain. With tinted windows and boring, gray letters that read \"Teharu\" across the top, I was already feeling doubt about this place before I even walked through the door. When we ventured in, it was like a slap in the face. Why? Well everything on the inside completely contradicts everything on the inside. The place was about half full, not too busy it seemed. Lots of faces were smiling and there were a lot of cheerful conversations going on through the atmosphere. In front of us was a little stand that had a sign that said \"Sign in and wait to be seated\". We were there for no longer than a minute or two before a small waitress with a huge grin came and greeted and seated us. We had seats right in front of the conveyor belt which was really exciting for me.  Right when we sat down, the waitress had already been asking for our choice of drinks and anything else we needed. Practically right in front of you, there is a chart, with different colored plates labeled with different prices ranging from 1.50 to 3.00. So right off the bat I already knew that this place wasn't expensive at all, when usual sushi bars are a bit pricey, charging almost 6 or 7 dollars a plate.  As I see each plate of sushi coming and going, I certainly didn't know where to begin. I had a few doubts, because with the plates continuously rotating until someone picks them up, you never knew how long the food was sitting there. Yet no one seemed to have a problem with it, so it must've been safe to eat! I've always been a big fan of sushi and the endless combinations of fish and vegetables so I couldn't wait any longer. The first plate I picked up was called a Spicy tuna roll. The plate was blue, so according to the chart in front of me, it was only 2 dollars. The first bite tasted exactly like how the name was, tuna and spicy. It was more delicious than what I expected it to be, so I downed the other 3 rolls right after the other. Another thing that I really loved about this place was that everything was convenient. All the sauces and napkins that you needed was already right at your table, so there was no need on asking a waiter for one. Although the workers came around and asked how we were doing often, there wouldn't be much of a problem to ask them for a thing or two. They were always right there if we had any questions or needed anything. A few conversations later I had already went through a few plates of sushi, and I had to admit I was getting very full very fast. I had another plate of Spicy Tuna rolls, along with a plate of tiger rolls, salmon rolls, california rolls, and dragon rolls. Even though the names on some of the selections were quite unusual, the taste brought it justice. There's a wide variety of selections, so even though some didn't seem appealing to me, I was sure that other customers were glad to have them. When the waitress has asked if we were ready to go, she had our check and we were out the door very quickly. I loved the employees, the food, and the environment. I will definitely be back soon, hungry for more.",

    "text": "I love Teharu Sushi.    First of all, for everyone that's complaining about the service, look at your bill.  Aside from the conveyor belt bringing the yummy sushi, handrolls and appetizer gifts your way, the best thing about Teharu Sushi is the bill.  Sure, it takes a while to get a seat or table  but when you do get a seat,  it takes less time grabbing your OWN food off the converyor belt than having to sit at a high priced sushi restaurant to basically serve you the same thing only 3x's the price and wait forever as well.    Cheapest plate, $1.00, most expensive plate $2.00.  Someone tell me anywhere else  they can get a $2.00 shrimp tempura roll?    You can't go into a restaurant with prices so low and expect 5 star treatment.    I'm not saying this is the best sushi place in the world as far as quality but if you're looking for a fun time with company at an inexpensive place, I recommend this place.",

It's definitely not fancy nor \"fine\" but what do you really expect when you're paying one dollar for a plate? Quality comes with a high price. The prices of the plates is what makes it fun because you can try something new without being afraid of ordering an entire roll of something you can't stomach and paying a bundle for it. Have I mentioned sake bombers are 5 dollars and a regular large Sapporo is 3.50? Not bad for going out.  All the waitresses have been fine. Some more English-friendly than others but always very attentive. 10 seconds after I grabbed some mandarin oranges off the belt our server was behind us with a spoon, ha.  I also like the fact that you can eat at your own pace and there's no pressure to order or finish in a typical time frame. The veggie tempura was pretty good and the miso soup was yummy too.  Overall, it's a lot of fun to eat here. It's nice-When you leave, the sushi chefs and servers all say good bye.",

I wouldn't describe it as \"really good\" or \"great,\" but it's definitely good enough to fulfill a sushi craving. And did I mention the price? I think you definitely get more than what you pay for here.   Because of that, you can expect it to be packed most of the time. However, I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes, and that was only because we were a large group. Other times it's been 10 minutes max.   The coolest and most novel thing about this establishment is the conveyor belt delivery. I had never seen one and I loved it! You can also order things if they are no available on the conveyor belt and they will make it for you.   One of the main reasons I don't give this place four stars instead of three (and the four-star rating would mostly be due to the prices) is because of how dirty the floors are every time we go. I understand the high foot traffic and all that, but there's a layer of grime all along the edge of the floor. Gah-ross.",

It's was so delicious that I ended up having 4. :D The prices are based on the color of the plate you grab. It's a perfect set up. As well as sushi, they have a full menu of items to choose from.

(It's a rotating sushi bar) so seating would be a little awkward in a big group.   You pick the sushi you want to eat off the belt and just grab it and eat it! The prices are based off of the color plates you have, which they total up at the end. Let's just say I myself ate 4 plates one time, and the bill was under $13.00!!! I think it was like 3 rolls of sushi and something else. Now try doing that at any other sushi place.

However, it might be better to consider the sushi here \"fast food sushi.\"  The rolls are small and pretty basic overall, many are variants of the california roll with different items on top.  i.e. california roll + chruncy topping = crunch roll + salmon = salmon roll + potato = mountain potato  and so forth.  The deep fried rolls are good if you can get them fresh, but by the time they come around the conveyor belt, that is often not the case.  While I love the atmosphere and the simplicity of the dining experience, this is not the place to get real, authentic sushi.  Also, this restaurant is always packed.  There was a waiting list to sit at 3 in the afternoon.  As such, it can be difficult to get the waiter's attention when you need a refill of water or the bill.

    "text": "As with all my reviews, my review of Teharu will compare the food relative to price. Who cares about service right? Go to China and tell me about service. Food is first and foremost.   Nigiri. $1 - Salmon: average quality for being priced at $1, wait how can I say that since I've never had $1 salmon nigiri???? its $1 and throughout my 4 years of going here, not once has it had a fishy smell. No fishy smell = $1 well spent.   -Tuna: similar to the salmon there is no fishy smell, and is $1, this equates to good spending.   -Tamago: not a big fan, had it once, was good. I can't really judge because I dont ever eat tamago but as stated earlier its $1, thus, no mold = $1 well spent.   Nigiri $1.50  -White Tuna: generous cuts given the price. I must emphasize price, some yelpers may disagree here with the cuts but relative to price it is very generous.   - Hamachi: Great and consistent generous cuts.   - Saba: They never have it.   Nigiri in General.   -Uni: Hardly anyone in phoenix eats this stuff which means its hard to find fresh, its a shame because I love this stuff but am too scared to order it here.   -Amaebi: I would not get this, like the uni, many arizonians do not like this stuff. They are unable to turn this stuff over quickly because of this the amaebi like the uni have a significantly longer cycle time, long replenish rate = no bueno!   Conclusion - Good bang for buck! Being a supply chain alumni from ASU I am all about being cost effective, and this place is the knees bees of cost effective sushi dining. Get full off of sushi for under $10? This is unheard of and because of that I give this place four stars. Economically friendly sushi is hard to come by, and at prices as low as a dollar for nigiri, if it don't stank I'll have a drank! :D",

    "text": "Revolving Sushi bar and Fine Japanese dining~ That's what the sign says.  Cool little color coded plates of sushi ride around on a moving belt before your eyes. Small portions make it easy to keep grabbing plates, then they add up the colors at the end and bring your check.  White= $1.25 Yellow=$ 1.75 Green=$ 2.25 Brown=$ 2.75 Black=$ 3.25  There is everything from Egg to shrimp and tuna etc. in 2 pieces and all kinds of rolls in 4 pieces, even little desserts go by. Also a small menu with tempura ,teriyaki, salads etc.  Don't see what you want? Just ask and they will make it appear!  I had a crunch roll and tuna avocado roll and an order of tuna (see pics) + drink and a tip was only $10.  Was the sushi Good? ~ it was OK (for $2 I can't complain), I liked the crunch roll, the tuna wasn't cut properly with the grain so you couldn't easily bite a piece off.  I don't know that they should be calling themselves  \"Fine Dining\" it's about as FINE as McDonald's if you know what I mean.  Don't go here here for quality sushi or atmosphere, go because you want sushi and only have $5 bucks to your name.  2.5 stars",

The sushi is usually pretty good and I love that you can request whatever type of roll you like and they will make it upon request. However yesterday the service was junk. We went at 4pm, not a very busy time. Our server took a good 10 mins to bring us soy dishes and chopsticks. She brought a water for my but we waited another 5 mins for her to bring water for my 3 kids. She was chatting it up with the other servers, laughing and standing around. The sushi chefs were kind enough to refill our waters and give me the spicy mayo I had asked for twice. It was very irritating, the service makes me not want to go back. But the sweet sushi chefs and cheap prices will keep me coming back.",

My sister brought her visiting friend here, and there was a bug on the plate of sushi. When they told the server she looked at the bug, and then squashed it with her finger on the plate. This is highly disgusting.   It makes me wonder, f there's bugs in the dining room, what does the back kitchen look like?  I really hate to give this place a bad review, because they food was good, prices are cheap, and who can beat a $5 sake bomb? But after these experiences with witnessing bugs I'm never going back.",

    "text": "This place is far from where I live, but so worth the trip! Had some wonderful friends take me here. I love conveyor belt sushi, and I've missed it - prepare yourself because I am about to brag - ever since I last went to Japan. The sushi quality and variety wasn't bad either...although, I was a little sad that more of the different rolls started coming out about 40 minutes after we were there and I had already stuffed my face to the point where I couldn't eat anymore. I was surprised to see they had gyoza and even cheesecake! Both were good, btw.   NOW - my only complaint about this place was the two waitresses we had that day.  We strolled in just after 1pm and immediately upon entering were abruptly told to sit down at the waiting bench. Okay. The first waitress comes back and tells us that our table is ready. After surveying the sushi bar, we politely asked if we could wait for seats at the bar. Her response was a heavy sigh as if we asked to be seated on the actual conveyor belt, then she walked away.  Sooooooo...does that mean we can or can't? I didn't know, as she walked away from us without an actual answer besides her obvious body language. Come on...I could understand if it was really busy and there were people behind us - but there was neither. So after waitress number one doesn't come back, waitress number two tries to seat us at that same table and we politely asked her the same question - \"May we be seated at the bar please? We're fine with waiting.\" Guess what?!?! SAME REACTION! Walked away and everything... Again, soooooooo does that mean we can or can't?  After a few minutes of waiting I finally got my answer (not verbally), but we were seated at the bar. The food made up for the blatant rudeness, but it is the customer service that is the reason I'm taking a star off. My friends go here fairly regularly and assured us the service was never like that before... I'm taking their word for it and will definitely update my review after my next visit to Teharu Sushi.  Oh...and after all my ranting, let me not forget to mention something positive - the bill was cheap!!! I seriously thought I ate about $30 worth (I SO was not counting), but it only came out to half that :D",

Maybe $12.   I can see how the strongest arguments for a place like this would be price and convenience.  I'm an asshole so I look at it as a type of \"Competitive Eating\" environment where we are all racing to see who can make the highest plate tower. I realize I'm given a substantial advantage being as I'm the only who even knows the contest is going on, but it's still a challenge. What can I say? I enjoy challenging myself. It says so on my resume. But I digress.  The food is okay. The nigiri is thin, but it's also $1 for two pieces, so I'm not going to complain. The rolls are basic but tasty. You only get 4 pieces on the plate, which is good for just one or two people because you can try stuff without committing to a whole roll. It's basically Sushi for Beginners rolling around on the conveyor belt and though I hear that you can special request things I haven't tried to do so yet. The highest priced plate is $2 so I'm not even sure something like Uni or Ikura is an option, though it would rock my world up if it was.  Another fun thing about the belt is that it's not all sushi! During my visit there were little bags of trail mix, pieces of cheesecake, a can of V8 (wtf?), and little Japanese sodas all circling around, waiting to get picked up. I like this concept and feel it should be expanded to include shots, beers, Yoo-Hoos and those Lik-M-Aid things the ice cream man used to sell. Those things were so good.  All in all, the food probably won't blow you away but it's fun and funny and you feel like you put one over on everyone when you eat 10 plates of sushi and your bill is only $13.50 including the can of V8. A-OK!",

The food is usually pretty good but typically not fresh (unless you put in your own orders...even then they will sometimes grab what's on the conveyor belt) and the service is typically awful (with the exception of Andrew)! We have tried eating there several times just to see if it got any better, but it doesn't. We have gotten sick 3 separate times and now refuse to go back. It's clear their focus is revenue and nothing more. It's a shame as it could be a really, really great place if they didn't sacrifice quality and sanitation so much. Yes, you get a LOT of food for your money, and it typically tastes good going in your mouth, but beware you may pay for it later out the other end. Don't waste your money here, the business needs to understand that their sanitation needs a second look. I know people go just because it's cheap but it's not worth it. DON'T GO!!",

My little daughter loves it also especially with the eclectic variety of cream puffs, seaweed salad, and soy beans.  The seared albacore is sometimes dry so chase it down with some white tuna.  The Unagi sauce could use some help also, needs to be thicker and sweeter. They sometimes seem to be understaffed because it feels like have to wait a while to get my check - maybe because the food is moving in front of you and you are so tempted to grab just one more plate,, and another one,,, and another one.

What caused the change? The German cockroach climbing the wall behind us. This wasn't a sewer roach. When your house becomes infested with roaches, these are the roaches you find. There is never just one, and the fact that it was in the dining area has it a little too close to the food prep area (which is smack in the middle of the dining room). I'm not generally one to generally worry about a bug or two. Flies come in through the door, etc. Roaches are a different matter entirely. Our last visit was just that... our last visit.",

I never even found prices that cheap in L.A. where you have sushi places on just about every other corner. Plus, this place is good!

Items are served via conveyor belt (if you're sitting at the bar) and plates are color-coded to indicate price. With the plates ranging between $1-$2 each, this is definitely a great bang-for-your-buck restaurant. Between 4 diners we came away with PLENTY of sushi for $10/head.  The Bad: The selection of sushi is certainly far from the largest I've ever seen. Should you be wanting a wide sampling of the cuisine of Japan, this is no the place to go. None of the sushi was gourmet-level, but everything I had was delicious.  I'd highly recommend Teharu to anyone who wants to sample various sushi without comitting to $7-$10 per item. This is also quite the novel change of pace for sushi afficianados looking for a very different serving style.",

If you do not plan to eat more than 4plates worth of sushi then this place is price reasonable. However if you go hungry and are ready to eat and stuff your face, then the price can be hurtful in the end. It was a fun experience and I would go again but, not often. Not a place for more than two people.",

Limited tables due to belt being half closed  She refuses to allow party of 2 to sit at tables. - skips name on waitlist for 3 or more people.  Most people go on lunch/dinner break so extra wait stinks!  Today - she told me she didnt speak English as she never pronounces my name correctly. - shouldn't work in America if she does not speak English serving Eng Speaking Guests.   Love the food and Chefs but she needs to be fired!  She stated that I complain everytime about 1/2 restaurant operating - maybe you guys should fix Problem!",

A smile or simple hello would help them out a bit.   Anyhow yes the food is on a moving circle thing and you pick what you're craving it's super simple. Honestly I liked almost all my rolls except the shrimp tempura it had no avocado, but that's an easy fix. I really liked that they had all the rolls and salads labeled right before them so we did not have to be asking what something was. My favorite roll was the rainbow roll and the seaweed salad was really good. My friend had baked mussels and he said they were super delicious in case anyone likes those. They also had a cheesecake that was so good that we had 2 lol  I would come back the prices are really really cheap and it takes the craving out of sushi without  having to spend an arm and a leg. My bill was $13 and had a ton of food and that includes my sake bomber.",

That's standard practice and a common courtesy for larger parties.  3) The discrimination against people with an accent is appalling.",

We aren't normally in that part of the city but we have visited Teharu Sushi in Scottsdale many times and have always enjoyed it so when we were in this area even though we weren't sure it the two are the same we decided to give it a try anyway.  It was around 1pm so after lunch rush. Signed in and didn't get the normal cheerful greeting from the employees like the other location.  Fine, we sat down and waited. Lots of plates/space not cleaned up. An employee finally came to greet us and asked how many we had but then disappeared. It was another few minutes before we were greeted again and then a few more before we were seated.  Ok now the food. All rolls and no sushi. We decided to order from the chef, never had to to that at the other location.  So we ordered a couple orders of salmon and tuna. It took about 10 mins before the salmon came and that was after a table that was seated after us received multiple plates of sushi. The tuna never came.  We finally gave up and closed out. Took another few minutes before the plates are counted.  Because the server could not multitask.  She actually counted the plates for another table gave them the bill and ran their credit card before she came to count our plates and took care of us.  Good thing we don't live near the area and will never have to return.",

Pros: - If you select food from the conveyor belt, you can eat somewhat quickly and inexpensively. - The quality of the sushi has been consistently decent (not great). - Handrolls and other sushi from the menu is much more fresh and much better than that from the conveyor belt.  Cons: - Most of the time they only have 3 or 4 tables open (mostly counter seating.) Not sure why this is the case since the entire restaurant is set up with access to the conveyor belts. - Quite often there is a wait (see \"Con\" line above = open more tables up) - Because of the previous \"Cons\" the servers are often running around and service is often mediocre. The last time I was there the server told me I couldn't have a table and had to sit at the counter even though tables were open. Also, the server gave me attitude each time I asked for something. A woman next to me even noticed the harsh treatment and gave me her fork for my daughter to use. Each time I asked for something (drink, napkin, ginger, more wasabi) she would rush past me and ignore me and then I'd have to ask her several more times. - Some of the sushi from the conveyor belt doesn't seem to be the freshest and often I wonder how many times it's been spinning around on the belt.",

For some reason I love the same concept when it involves waiting around a conveyor for a plate of raw fish.  Walk in, and sign up.  This is smart eliminating the need for a hostess that does little.  Get to your seat tell then what you want to drink and start looking at the plates. From what I saw most nigiri is $1 or $1.50 for two pieces. They are a bit smaller that normal ngiri. The Quality was decent Not great or gourmet but not bad or scary like you may think $1 sushi is.   Rolls come in 4's (spicy tuna $1.50) and fancy 4s  (Hawaii roll $2) plates.  I really enjoyed the Hawaii roll which is just a spicy tuna roll plus tuna on top and a siricha and mayo mix.  Part of the fun is watching everything go by and wondering what will be next.  The best spots will be near the cooking area as you get first pick at the plates.  We go here early at 5:15 on a rainy weeknight and it was busy so, worries about general fish freshness can be avoided.  However I do wonder how they keep track of less popular items,  like the squid salad or mackerel. The whole hour we were here I think I saw the same plates make over 10 lonely trips around.  I did learn that you can ask the cooks in the center for special orders too if you don't see what you want, however I did not test this.  They also have non sushi items making their way around, from edamame, cream puffs, cheese cake, Asian drinks, pudding cups and some jalapeno popper concoction.  If you want a fun cheaper sushi meal give this place a try. Its not the best sushi but its fun cheap and unique for Arizona.   3.5 stars if I were allowed FYI  In the end they add up the plates and you pay. hooray, I am not sure how to tip at a place like this.",

    "text": "So I have been going here for years. We have other sushi places closer to us but drive 20 minutes because normally this is our favorite. But over the last few visits things have been getting worse and worse. The food itself is still good, the problem is the staff. We walk in and there are 2 large groups ahead of us and 1 small group. We visibility see open spots at the bar but have to wait to be seated. I hear one of the big groups talking to one of the staff members who is telling them it is going to be nearly impossible to seat them because 6 six people is too many to sit at the bar. They point out to the staff member that there is a whole row of empty tables that will work. The staff member tells them that they can sit there but will have to walk to an from the bar to get food because the owner refuses to turn that side of the conveyor belt on. They reach an agreement and get seated. Meanwhile more chair are opening and we still can't go to them (a total of 20 minutes) because no one is bothering to clean them off or check the names in the list. When we finally get seated our waiter takes our drink order, puts it down, and proceeds to disappear for the rest of our visit. The staff mostly stands around or talks with each other and had no sense of urgency when it came to taking care of us. No one ever checked in and we had to wave someone else down to get our check. He had to count 3 different times the number of plates we had, and then got someone else to come over and check his counting.  I am hoping that the owner sees this, I hope they take note and open up the second side again. I hope they hear the service their staff is giving.",

Very luckily 6 seats cleared at once at the bar. They sat another party ahead of us! When I asked they said they didn't seat parties of 6 at the bar. They failed to mention this rule before we waited 20 minutes. They were horribly rude when we tried to discuss what was happening. The woman who said she was the manager stopped me mid-sentence and said, \"Can you listen to me for a minute.\"  I couldn't believe how disrespectful she was. They lost 6 loyal customers and that is very disappointing to me.",

I have eaten here previously and had an an enjoyable experience, but today my wife and I went to this location for lunch and I have never had such  appaling service. We were told to sit at the sushi bar and asked for a table because I am in a walking boot and the sushi bar was an uncomfortable fit. One server told us to sit and wait for the table. Another then asked if he could help us, and when we explained we were waiting for a table he went to confirm with the first server. Then a third server (I assume she was their boss by the way she sopke to them) told my wife there was no table for us and \"You sit here!\" In a loud commanding tone pointing to the sushi bar. My wife and I were absolutely stunned at her rudeness payed for the 2 plates we ate, and left. If Teharu is your jam, head to the Scottsdale location for better service and fresher fish.",

It is perfect for that sushi fix when you don't care for super high quality. Plus once you are seated (there's a wait during peak hours but is a steady flow), you just grab your plates and dig right in. This has been our go-to for years and will continue to be. What's more fun than your sushi rolling right in front of you, ready to eat for no more than $3? Not much. Oh and this little detail may be small to others but I truly appreciate the bottles of unagi/eel sauce available at the bar for us who like sweet instead of salty soy sauce. I always have to ask for eel sauce at all other sushi joints. There is also unlimited pickled ginger at the bar/tables for your ginger lovers.",

I'll be the first to admit that sushi in Arizona doesn't really impress me (I'm from California) and this place is added to my list of places to not eat at again.   The sushi going around on the conveyor belt is warm. I got one plate off the belt, didn't like it, and then ordered directly from one of the chefs hoping that it would be better.   I got some maguro nigiri (tuna over some rice) and it was really badly cut and did not taste fresh at all.   I also got some other rolls and pieces of nigiri, and the quality and taste did not impress me. Their Haru Sushi did not taste good and had way too much of the fake crab mix. Almost all of their rolls use that fake crab mix and I hate eating it. I don't know how it first was called a California Roll, but I do my best to never order rolls with it. Give me quality nigiri or sashimi anyday. Sadly, you won't get it.   Save your money and go across the street to In-n-Out.",

The sushi quality is definitely not as good as say Shimogamo in Chandler or Sekai in Mesa, but there are a lot of other aspects of the restaurant that will allow you to forgive that. I don't really judge conveyor belt sushi places on the same on the same playing field as non-conveyor places because the experience is quite distinguished.  First great thing is that if it's a busy night (talking like Thurs-Sat past 6pm) and you're nearby and you call 30 or so minutes ahead of arriving, your name will be called just as you walk in the door (has worked for me twice, kinda strange actually). Otherwise, it's only about a 25-30 minute wait at its worst for walk-in sushi appointments.   Secondly, the food is cheeeeeap. Definition of a \"1 dollar sign\" restaurant. If you've been to conveyor belt sushi before, you'll know that they charge by the color of the plate(s) your chosen dish is served on (green is like a buck, red might be a buck fifty, don't remember offhand but no one dish from the conveyor is really over $3).  Third, with all the money you saved by not going to Ra, you will be able to buy more drinks!  Fourth, good service. They will leave you alone after they get you started and are pretty available if you need them. Well staffed restaurant.  Fifth... hm... shoulda stopped at fourth but 5 is a better, rounder number.  There are a couple of sushi places I want to hit in North Scottsdale first, but I will soon return to Teharu.",

I also grabbed the cucumber salad (more sweet than tang, reminding me of my grandmothers bread and butter pickles), the seaweed salad, the rainbow roll (decent fish, but the avocado was dried out), the maguro (far more pink than red...), the salmon (a little on the slimy side, but it didn't smell or taste funny, just weird texture), and tried, at the behest of my less sushi experienced colleagues, the baked scallops on top of a california roll (just plain weird - the top was a combination of crab and baked scallops with some cream sauce, which I'm still tasting now, 4 hours later...).    This was the first conveyor belt sushi place that I've been to in the US, but I knew that just like all sushi in the US, it wouldn't be as good as what I'd had in Japan.  Even considering, I don't think I'll be recommending this place to the rest of the team in the future.  This is a good place to introduce people to sushi, and it's cheap, and fast (once you have a table), but if you've been to Japan and had the real thing, this Americanized version just won't cut it.",

If you're a sushi snob, this place may not impress you since the sushi is somewhat mediocre (you get what you pay for!) although it's definitely worth checking out.   The sushi comes on plates (ranging from $1 to $2.50) and travels on a conveyor belt around the sushi chefs - definitely a fun experience! There's a variety of rolls and salads to choose from, as well as random things like Asian soda, juice, pudding, cheesecake and cream puffs.  It's can be a hit & miss depending on the time of day and how busy it is. Lunch & dinner time may have you waiting a while. Be sure to get your name down immediately on the notepad by the door and write how many people are in your party. The staff are friendly and attentive. Once seated, how much time and money you want to spend is entirely up to you! It's definitely a great place for a quick lunch! I go there at least once a week for my sushi fix!  Although what's offered is on the belt, you can make requests for items you don't see. Overall, I'd say this place is enjoyable. The atmosphere is relaxed, casual and clean. Definitely a must-try! Bring your friends and family! At the end, stack up your empty plates! You'd be surprised how many you end up with when you're not paying attention! ;) Enjoy!",

    "text": "Back when I discovered Teharu in 2008 (didn't discover Yelp until 2009), it was still this secret little gem that I slowly introduced to all my friends and family (wait, could this all be my fault?!) But now, it seems during any meal time, there's quite a long wait, and not enough staff. And when you do finally get a seat, the selection on the belt is pretty limited since most of the popular stuff goes fast.  I was just recently here with some friends and we waited about 15 mins to seat us (3 people). I've been coming here intermittently (I no longer live in the US) but the last few times I've gone, it's just been disappointing. Normally, the staff is forgetful, slow and useless, but at least the last time I went the staff was fairly competent. But we ended up having to order some rolls and the most basic of our order (a crunch roll.. c'mon, a california roll with tempura flakes) took the longest. So long that we asked 3 different servers, and it actually took about 30 minutes to come (when the chefs finally made a batch to put on the belts). But any time you order something expect it to take a while.  I hope that they improve the service here - I always loved Teharu, fairly decent sushi at really cheap prices. Not the best, but definitely the most fun. I want to keep loving Teharu... please improve!",

Second trip ... no clue ... a friend paid but I would be willing to be it was closer to $15-$16 range.  Great for lunch with a crowd.  Accommodated 8 of us pretty easily.  If you go for lunch get there around 11:30.  Too early and not enough rolls are out.  The fun ones start coming out when more people show up.

The sushi selection is more on the limited side; however, I was pleasantly surprised of how fresh the yellowtail and the octopus was. The food was a good solid 3.5 stars. . . . so why barely 3 stars?   SERVICE sucks! Perhaps I may have internalized resentment growing up in a Korean American community and experiencing various Korean owned and serviced restaurants, but damn these people had no shame. I made a reservation at 7:00 pm and they seemed to be clueless of my reservation. They repetitively asked my name and I answered as patiently as I could. Now the repetivive question was not due to a language barrier but I swear they seemed like they were hoping WE made the mistake. Even after we were seated, they continued to question what my name was and if my reservation was for a certain time. We felt like they were going to take away our seats even after being seated because of their persistent questioning with 2 different servers taking their turn interrogating us. Not to mention, the spilled soy sauce that we almost slipped on near our table.   So on average, I gave Teharu 3 stars. I am hoping for better service in my future visits. Good sushi, excellent price, but poor service.",

They're really nice & accomodating.  They'll ask you how many plates you want too.  I usually only request one, and they put the rest of that roll on the conveyor belt.  My favorites include: -Hawaiian roll: spicy tuna topped w/ tuna -Spicy crab & shrimp roll -Haru sushi: two pieces of tuna wrapped around imitation crab & topped with a few slices of avocado -Haru popper (mispelled 'poper'): tempura-fried stuffed jalapenos -Crunchy California roll: I only eat this if it's topped w/ eel sauce (they should have a bottle of it there for you) -Vegas roll  The asparagus roll isn't good.  I've only tried it once, and refuse to try it again.  The rice was dry & so was the asparagus.  I would say the quality of the fish isn't as good/fresh as Mido Sushi or Kabuki, but hey, it's only $1-$2 a plate!  Being a petite little Asian girl, I usually eat about 6 plates on my own.  The wait is terrible during dinner hours, especially on a Friday night.  However, the good part about this place (other than price) is that once you get table, you can immediately grab plates off of the conveyor belt!  I always end up grabbing at least two plates before actually sitting down & getting utensils from the waiter. :)",

They now have a sign in sheet with a sign stating that you need to sign in when you show up in order to be seated. They are still crowded like usual, however it seems like they've hired a whole new wait staff. There's no longer just one or two people running around trying to keep up, they have enough people there now to make sure you're taken care of and you have refills etc... when you need them. Their sushi is still the same, that is to say good when fresh, if they're not busy I wouldn't go for anything that's supposed to be cooked e.g. gyoza or vegas rolls, they get kind of gross when cold. Overall, the experience here has improved and it doesn't take forever to get your check anymore. Much imporved Haru, I'm proud of you!!",

    "text": "If you're looking for the greatest sushi place ever... you may want to look somewhere else. If you're looking for a place to chow on decent sushi on a tab under $15, then you've found the right place.   Teharu Sushi is a restaurant done in the classic Japanese style, where there's a conveyor belt running along the bar and most of the tables. Along the belt is a gamut of various sushi stylings. Nigiri (raw fish on rice) or rolls, gyoza (potstickers), edamame (soy beans), and other random fare (like pudding cups and Japanese soda) run their course through the restaurant, beckoning you to grab them.   And that's what you do. See something you like? Grab it off the belt, and go to town. Each plate is color coded, denoting the price (anywhere from $1-$3). This allows you to have a large sampling of many different kinds of sushi, rather than dropping $6-12 on a single large roll of sushi most other restaurants force you to do.  The sushi isn't spectacular, and runs the course of familiar rather than out of the ordinary more often than not, but the fact that you can sample multiple varieties rather than committing to just one for the same price more than makes up for it.   They also sell 22oz. bombers of either Kirin or Sapporo for $4. All day. No happy hour special, $4 for a large beer. Amazing.  For the less adventurous, they actually have a decent sized, decent priced normal menu too. My wife ended up getting the salmon teriyaki one time when we came here and was very impressed.  The conveyor belt is a bit of a novelty, but after the dozen or so times I've gone, it still hasn't worn off. It literally saves this place from being a mediocre sushi bar to being a fantastic sushi bar. Being able to have so many different kinds of sushi and a beer for under $15 is the reason why I love this place so much. Definitely check it out, you'll be hooked.",

They continued to call \"Nick\" for almost 20 minutes when it was very clear that \"Nick\" had left (1 star). All I could do was laugh. Once we were seated, the service was very good (5 stars). We put in our drink order and it was brought to us with in 2 minutes! Nice job waiter dude! The sake was just horrible, probably the worst I have ever had (1 star) and let me tell you I can put back sake. The miso soup was pretty good (4 stars). The sushi was not the greatest. Their specialty roll was good but the rest were mediocre at best (2.5 stars). The price was reasonable but I don't think we will ever go back. My significant other really disliked Teharu, he voted for 1 Star but I thought that was pretty harsh. Anyway, I like the whole \"sushi on a conveyor belt\" idea. I have been to a couple other sushi places like Teharu and they are always fun and entertaining, but the sushi was much better. Hope this review was helpful for anyone that is on the fence!",

They don't get your drinks quick enough and getting the attention of our server can get tricky.  Normally, I have dinner at Teharu. Today, I wanted to try something different for lunch. Like most people, lunch is a relativity short period of time. I wanted to grab something and get out. They open 11 am so a couple of buddies and I thought we come in right at 11.  We walked in the door at 10:57 and nothing was on the conveyor belt. This was a bad sign already. We should have headed into NYPD for a slice of pizza. They made us wait for about 5 minutes which was reasonable. We sat down. They actually got our drink order pretty quickly since we were the first ones to arrive.  The older lady came back with our drinks and by that time, we have been sitting for about 5 minutes. The only thing going around the conveyor was cream puffs, cheesecake, and soda. Knowing that I had a time crunch, I wanted to place my sushi order so that I can finish my lunch and be on my way. The older lady flat out said no. \"The sushi chefs are busy\" and walked away. I was astounded. Seriously? If your hours of operations say 11 am, you should be ready to feed your customers at 11 am.  She came back after 5 minutes realizing what she had said. She asked 1 out of 3 people what they wanted. We order 4 plates of one roll. She came back with only 2!  We ended up staying 30 more minutes, attempting to get some sushi. The options at 11:30 were very limited. After sitting for 30 minutes, I didn't see a single crunch roll, Philly roll, California roll, or dragon roll and we were prohibited from making requests.  Our meal was 19 dollars and some change for 3 people. THREE PEOPLE! We were ready to get our grub on and eat some sushi and the server basically said, no, you can't get your sushi right now because we are busy with opening the restaurant.  This was poor customer service. I requested our bill at 11:30 and it took another server 5 minutes to come back and count our plates.  In the end, I had maybe 3 plates of sushi. I was starving still and I took 15 minutes extra for lunch because I didn't want to walk out on Teharu Sushi. I was pretty forgiving but they simply wasted my lunch hour today. I now know to never go to Teharu during my lunch. There is a high chance I won't make it back in time and have my sushi!!!!! :(",

The price was super amazing, between $1-$3 a plate, which comes with 3-4 pieces of sushi per plate. The soda ($1.75), is in a plastic bottle so no unlimited refills however I have yet to need a refill while eating there. The majority of the seating is at the sushi bar. There are only a few tables there so it is hard to have a group conversation unless you are lucky enough to get a table. I have wanted different rolls than they offered and asked them to make them for me. They made them quickly and without hassle. The staff has always been very nice and attentive.",

    "text": "Found this place a few weeks ago on Yelp, as I just moved to the area.  Plus: Decent variety of sushi on the conveyor belt. Inexpensive (generally $1-2 per plate); portions are not surprisingly small, but it gives you the chance to try a lot of things. Love the baked mussels. They have small sides, like udon soup, for only a few bucks to round out your meal.  Minus: Not much space at the counter, especially with stacks of empty plates and lids in the way. Service is somewhat inattentive; can take awhile to get drinks or a soy sauce bowl with wasabi (they should just have these on the conveyor). I always feel like I'm inconveniencing them when I ask for something. Sometimes have to ask for certain items to be refilled when they're low on the belt; if you like something, grab it while you can because it might not be there the next time around!  My biggest complaint about this place is it's always crowded. Even at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, the counter will be completely full. The restaurant is a good size, but they seem to keep half of it closed (including half the conveyor belt) to crowd everyone into a small space where the sushi chefs work. Out of 4 times I've been there, only once was the other part open and they were in the processing of closing it down. Tonight I came in around 6:15 and there were 15 people waiting and only half the restaurant being used. We ended up leaving; very frustrating, because they have the space and refuse to use it.",

I did like the concept of sitting down and immediately start eating. The variety was nice but the food itself was luke warm at best (I like my vegas roll and dumplings warm). The best thing I ate was the \"I love salmon\" roll. Service was OK, our drinks took a while to get to the table and staff was a little too casual for my liking. Our waiter pretty much insinuated I should be able to handle drinking a large beer because thats all they serve in the beer I wanted. When my friend asked for ginger ale, the waiter laughed and said \"we dont have that\". When she ordered lemonade, he brought back an arnold palmer. I get they were busy but a little attention would have been nice. Overall, I would probably come back for a quick and cheap meal but I can't say I will be running back anytime soon.",

    "text": "I always thought I didn't like sushi! I've had friends take me to pricey, fancy sushi places - I tried many things, including eel, but I just didn't like anything. Plus, there were many dishes of sauces that no one at the table was using, or could tell me how to use. WTF?      I really, really didn't want to go for sushi, but I *did* want to hang out with my friends. I figured I could grab a California roll or two, and grab a burger or something later if I wanted.      But I found stuff here that I liked! I mean, REALLY liked! There was a list of what's in each roll, but on this day there were a LOT of dishes that weren't on the list. Some of them my friends could tell me, some not. They also had fun stuff like \"Haru poppers\", which are chilies with stuff in them. Not sure what, but it was good! I also don't know what's in the \"Tiger Roll\", but I was adventurous & it looked good, and since it was on a $1.50 plate, I took a chance. Not only did I love it, but I could confirm for one of my friends that it was a non-spicy dish, lol.      None of us care for wasabi so those dishes went untouched ... most things like the Spicy Shrimp & Crab rolls didn't need anything added, but the Tiger Rolls benefited from a couple of drops of soy sauce. I didn't know what the usagi (or whatever) sauce was, but it tasted like a soy bases fish or eel sauce. I didn't care for it, but I like having choices.      And that's what's great about this place! You can look at the food, and think \"Hmmm, maybe not\". You can have green tea hot or iced, or you can have soda or beer or plum wine! It wasn't that busy so there were a lot of empty spots on the conveyor, and I never did get a Philadelphia rolls 'cause everyone else grabbed them, but I definitely had a good time with friends & filled up on food I loved for $10!     One of my favorite things is the weird random stuff. Sometimes you'll look at the conveyor and there will be a can of Vienna sausage, Spam, mixed fruit, or a cup of chocolate pudding. I'm wondering how many people get dragged to sushi against their will by friends - this way, you can say \"MAN, ok, we get it, you don't like sushi, here, have some Spam!\" I almost grabbed the pudding because FUNNY, but I'd already had the little ice cream puffs thingies (YUM), so I didn't. Maybe I'll have some Vienna sausage next time. Nah ... too many yummy dishes!",

Now if they would do the same w/ the wasabi......  Lots of nice choices.  Liked the squid salad, something different.  Not sure why the salads (cucumber, seaweed) are running more than the standard sushi plate, unless they are pricing it up on volume??  They have some fruit and dessert options going round on the belt.  They even had inari, my idea of Japanese dessert.    Overall sushi quality is average and enjoyable to snack on.  The prices make this place a 'must return' and do so often.  Friends made-to-order salmon handroll was $1?!?!?!",

What better place then Haru Suhi, it was recommended to us by a friend thats live near there, and we were hooked. The place has a traditional REVOLVING sushi bar just like they do in Japan. ( you sit at the bar, and sushi comes around on a moving belt )  They always yell hello in japanese when you walk in and once your seated ( which sometimes you might have to wait if you wanna sit at the revolving bar)  you can sit down and start eating right a way. There is already sushi on moving belt, you just take the plate you want and start eating.  The portions are small but this way you get to try alot of different rolls and types of sushi instead of filling up on one or two rolls ( which is what I think what they wanted).   They charge you by the plate anything from $1.00-$2.00 and if you dont see anything you like they will make anything you want ( but charge you accordingly). I recommend the VEGAS roll, BAKED SCALLOP roll, HARU sushi, and SIZZILING SALMON are some of my favorites.  We were so full! (sushi coma) we had 14 plates ranging from $1-2  and our bill was $31 and some change, with tax, for the both of us. CHEAP!   anywhere else we would have spent $50 at least.  We go there at least once a week or every other week just to eat there, and we live in Central Phoenix. Its worth the drive for us.",

The two experiences were worlds apart. When we walked in, the tables half of the belt was closed and only the bar was seating, as is typical for slower hours, but there were about six other parties waiting when we walked in the door and another six or so had come in by the time we finally got seated and it wasn't until halfway through our meal (and who knows how many more incoming parties) that they finally opened the other half of the belt and began seating at the tables. I can't see any excuse or justification for a business to willingly keep half the seats in their restaurant empty when there are about 20 hungry paying customers waiting at the front. Even though we were off to a bad start, the food and service were both good. Not wonderful, but good, though not nearly as good as the Scottsdale counterpart. Three stars because the service (once we were seated) and the food were good but not good enough to make up for the fact that they were happy to allow scores of patrons to stand there for 15-20+ minutes staring at the empty tables they aren't being sat at.",

I had to ask for our order 3 times.  It took the lady making the sushi over 25 mins to do 6 orders of egg.  I noticed that she was busy talking to the men on the other side of the sushi bar and was not filling our order.  It is to bad becasue the sushi is reasonable.",

I also love how the plates are each $1.50 or $2.00 and the portions are small (3 pieces to a plate) so you're not stuck with 8 pieces when you order one roll. This way, you can sample a little bit of everything. I got 2 rolls, edemame, dumplings (forget the actual name) and my husband got 4 rolls and the total cost? $15! Hot damn, we WILL be back!!!",

This has been a very fun omega 3 plan you can't get at home.   The service can vary though ...after a while of regular visits they were treating us well until recently when some of those employees left. Last visit we were left dealing with the turnover and owner who clearly possess little recall for a good  customer.  If the owner is managing the tables, plan on an unbelievably long wait for your bill and not even a friendly nod for a 50% tip.  Try to have cash in the exact amount as it took 15 minutes to get our change while the owner hung around the cash register doing what, I'd could never guess.",

I was a fan of their yellowtail and spicy tuna topped with tuna and my girlfriend swears by the Haru Poppers  I'll be back as often as I'm down on this side of town for sure considering our party of four ate for $40!  I spend that on myself alone at a Sushi Brokers or Kabuki.  Different quality of fish for sure but still a great bargain with good tastes.",

I admit that I have had a few days I have come that they are busy and have had to wait a few minutes , however I have never had bad food here if any I have had some of the best tasting sushi especially for the price. I think that as a small business owner that there are way to many people ready to give businesses a bad review, when the service isn't quite such a perfect experience that they expect. I have been at this place enough to know that the food is great for the price and the service isn't top notch but they don't have to do much as YOU serve yourself.How much do you think the waitresses need to jump when you do that. I wonder about people sometimes!!!",

The last 2 times I have gone there have been issues. Today was the final. I didn't see asparagus on the conveyer so I placed an order for the rolls. I waited 28 minutes. When I finally flagged someone down and asked about my rolls they said \"they are making them now\". Another 10 minutes and we finally ask for the check. When he is tallying up the plates I said \"hey I don't want to be charged for those rolls cause I have been waiting 30 minutes\" he shrugged. Someone in my party said \"what happened why did it take so long?\" The server responded with \"I don't know sometimes they just don't feel like making it\". My friend said \"are we allowed to sometimes not pay?\"  The server went to ring up our total - in plain site- and stood there mimicking and making fun of our table. When he came back with the bill I said \"is that funny over there?\" My friend said \"were you making fun of me over there?\" Here is the kicker - he said \"yeeeesss\".  After bringing us back our change he THEN said he was sorry. I said that should have been your first response. We let him know we will not be back, which bums me out because I really did enjoy this place. Granted, it's like a buffet wherein you serve yourself.  However, there are servers there to refill your drinks, take your special orders and so on- you should still have a sense of customer service.  I really hate to not return, but I'm not.",

I mean, a conveyor belt is super fun, but raw fish riding around the restaurant without any refrigeration is a scary notion.   I am not a fish person, so I stick to shrimp and krab/crab (yes, I know krab is pressed fish.. ) and didn't try any of the fish rolls, but everyone else at the table mentioned that their rolls were all fishy.  Fishy fish is a sign that it isn't very fresh.  A lot of people complained about the service...I didn't think it was particularly bad. You would get the same type of service at any other buffet-type restaurant.  It is cheap, but so is Taco Bell.

The nice thing about eating there is that, at the end, they will stack up your sushi plates... Alllll.... the way up there... it's fun and make the occasion memorable.

In addition to sushi they also put pudding cups and fruit cocktail into the rotation, which confuses me as I don't come to sushi bars to eat pudding. :P I've never seen anyone take any of the pudding or fruit cups off the belt.   It gets super crowded at lunch, and slow, so if you're in a hurry this isn't a good place to go. The last time I came here for lunch the wait was long, and crowded, and for some reason they only had the sushi bar open had the dining room closed off, even though the conveyor belt hits every booth in the place. There were a few groups of people  waiting, and they could have been seated at the booths, so the sushi bar would have been freed up for everyone else. Service is a bit slow, but they are polite and cheerful.   I haven't been here in awhile, so I plan on going again to see if anything has improved.",

The purpose of sushi is for it to taste fresh and to be made to order. However when there are numerous plates revolving around, becoming room temp, it does not make for a good dining experience. We tried the lobster roll and I've never seen lobster that looked like tuna and tasted like one would imagine how cat food would taste. So, we decided to order off the menu in the hopes that it would be fresher since it was just made. WRONG!!! The tuna roll was warm and the Philly roll smelled \"fishy\". We literally left everything untouched.  This was the worst dining experience I have had since being in Arizona for three years. I def would advise any and everyone to stay away from this place unless you are looking for a fast food version of sushi.",

    "text": "Hello to all my fellow Az foodies!  Today I would like to tell you why I think if you are looking to enjoy some sushi and you think about trying Teharu in Tempe you should get back in your auto and drive over to your local grocery store and buy it there!  It has to be better than what you will experience here.  My friend has been RAVING about Teharu in North Scottsdale.  She tried it a few months back and has been a frequent customer since.  She came out to Tempe to meet for some sushi and having heard so many great things about the Scottsdale location and that the owner of each location are brothers I was super excited to check it out.  We went at 2:30pm, the place was pretty empty, yet that converyor belt was full of shushi... I am not sure who all that food was for but lets stop a moment and think about it... ok, so this conveyor belt runs the length of the dining room and there are maybe 10 people in the restaurant and you have to wonder just how long that food has been taking the \"conveyor ride\".  Absolutely NOTHING looked fresh and or appetizing....the freshiest looking food was the little cans of fruit that were \"just along for the ride\".  The signs indicating what the items were, were scarce.  They have maybe 4 or 5 of each item and each one had a different look and color....scary stuff!  The fried items sat under a plastic cover with the moisture dripping back into the food.  In theory conveyor belt sushi sounds good and although this may be common in Japan... this is Not Japan and it just doesnt work!  There were several items we had to take off the belt just to try and identify and we put it right back on...  I know you dont even want to consider this but.......... whos to stop someone from lifting the lids and touching the food as it goes by?  Like you, I would hope noone is inconsiderate enough to do something like that but really..... happens all the time!   Do you really want to chance it?  I tried  a couple items before I just couldnt do it anymore.  The ends of the fish were discoloring and turning up .  I wont bother to go into detail about any one item because there was not 1 item worth talking about.  My friend assured me that the Scottsdale location was nothing like Tempe and she said if she had tried Tempe location first she NEVER would have gone back or tried the other location.  It's the same for me... I made the mistake of trying Tempe location and I have absolutely no desire to try Scottsdale..  From what we were told 2 brothers each own one of the stores but they are run completely different..  So, heres a tip for the brother who owns Tempe location.....  LISTEN TO YOUR BROTHER!  DO WHAT HE DOES.... you are giving TEHARU a bad name!!  What would your mother think?  Oh yes, almost forgot to mention the employees... theres plenty of them... standing around ... but try to get some more water or wasabi!  HA!  I would honestly have to say in the MANY years I have been ejoying sushi...this was the WORST I have yet to experience.  One of the many reviews I read on Teharu wrapped it up to this... \"mediocre at best\"... I feel that was extremely generous!  Usually at this point I say... go, try it...see what you think but I gotta say....  Dont waste your time or money and dont insult your taste buds.  Spend a few bucks more and go somewhere ...anywhere else!  And so I say, enjoy each day as though it were your last and enjoy! Bon' Appetite",

The longer you sit there the more inclined you might be to add another plate. I resisted more than 3 selections and we hailed a server over for the bill.  Not a bad spot for fast sushi.",

There is awful K-pop on the speakers.  And yet, the place is where I go when I want sushi, and it never fails to deliver. It has a good mix of \"real\" sushi and \"American\" sushi, and everything is fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt is a fun way to pick and choose what you want to eat.  Even my wife, who is quite picky, has found a couple of things she now eats at all sushi places (cali roll, spicy crab and shrimp roll, edimame).  You can order specific rolls if you don't see them coming up (Baked Scallop Cali Roll), and count on delicious Las Vegas Rolls and Mountain Potato Rolls to kick the flavor up a notch.",

My family of 4 sat here for 25 minutes and none of the sushi on the left side had been replenished in that time. There are two belts. We ordered our own rolls to come out and that took 20 minutes until someone had finally asked if we were doing okay. We were fed up and just had them cancel our orders. Another couple next to us had ordered the same amount at the same time as us and there's had already came out. You get what you pay for, even then it's still not worth it including tip. We left hungry. Come here with caution.",

We waited 10 more minutes, then two cops walked in. It had been about 25 minutes into our wait when the waitress came and sat down the cops who walked in last. I was livid. Cops should not be getting any sort of special attention and especially not if there's a wait. My husband and I held our tongues. 5 minutes passed and the same waitress went ahead and seated the white guy before my husband and I who at this point had been waiting 30 minutes. When I addressed that we had been waiting longer, the waitress made no attempt to apologize or anything. Not only did I feel that Teharu showed a lack of equality but also proceeded to show discrimination towards us. I would rather pay more for sushi than go to a place that has no sense of customer service. I felt very disrespected and do not plan on returning here again.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been trying to find a revolving belt sushi shop around Arizona for a while. In the Pacific Northwest, there were plenty, but we really had to scour yelp to find some in Phoenix. I stopped in for lunch today (a Sunday) and it was quite busy. When we arrived there were thankfully just two tight spots near the revolving belt. When I say tight, I truly mean that you have to be careful not to bump into the person next to you tight. I noticed a lot of the dishes revolving around the belt didn't have covers, which was slightly concerning because with so many people hovering around the bar, I didn't want some stranger breathing all over the dishes I chose....so I mentally decided that any dish without a cover was a no-go for me. Out of the numerous plates we tried the only one that seemed appetizing and fresh was the salmon nigiri, which we had to ask one of the chefs to make us. I also noticed that unlike most revolving sushi joints I've been to, they don't mix up the plates very well. For example....they may have ten seaweed salads all lined up in a row and you'll have to wait for them all to pass if you didn't want seaweed salad. The next round of plates might be cream puffs and you'll have to wait again to see a new selection of plates. Most other places I have been to would mix up the plates so that you don't have to sit there and wait. When we were here, there wasn't much variety in terms of the types of plates that were circulating and since the sushi didn't taste fresh, we decided to leave. Maybe we came on an off day....I hear the one in Scottsdale got pretty decent reviews. But as I like to end reviews on a good note, I would say that I enjoyed the decor of the shop and the modern pop music they played was very good :D Chefs were very nice and accommodating",

I couldn't help but notice how dirty the place was upon arriving, with raw fish it's definitely a certain level of cleanliness I except, like spotless. I ate one roll and noticed how old the rolls on the conveyor belt looked, as if they screamed food poisoning. The one roll I did have was tasteless and made of fake crab, it was cheap though I guess you get what you pay for in that regard. I left and just went to the in-n-out across the street, so much for sushi night.",

You're choosing really what you want and how much you wanna eat so that's a good. Now it's not like the best sushi on the planet, but it's definitely better than some places that's say they have some really good sushi. The have some of the most basic rolls to some fan favorites like Vegas and tempura rolls. I think the most we've ever waited there is like 30 mins but it was really busy and it was obvious we'd be waiting a while. But I will for sure come again to this place.",

We ordered a plain udon, which is an item they have consistently kept the same (with the noodles, fish cakes, seeweed, etc). There were so many new workers there, that they had no idea what udon was and kept thinking I wanted tempura. Thirty minutes pass, and I get a bowl with hot water, no seasoning, and warm noodles. I sent it back and they just added fish broth to it and then gave it back. Because their soup tasted nothing like the soup I've had at this location for seven plus years, I told them to remove it from the tab. Unfortunately, this waitress insisted that it was my fault for not liking the soup since she couldn't handle the criticism and fact that it didn't taste like it used to. Then she persisted with arguing and arguing on and on about how this instant pack of noodles that costs less than a dollar to produce was wasting her businesses money. I rebuttaled by stating the facts: I have eaten there for years. I have always ordered the udon and it never tasted fishy and gross like this. Supposedly she is the boss of the restaurant, but this hag needs to understand that \"The customer is always right\". Somebody needs to translate that for her in a way that her arrogant narrow minded conceited self can understand, because then this business WILL fail.",

Teharu prices are super affordable (dirt cheat, for lack of better terms) compared to your average sushi restaurant. I prefer Teharu over Eastwind in DT Chandler, which offers the same concept.   If you're dining in, you will get to experience the conveyor belt. It's a neat concept until you realize that the same plates have been making the same rotation so maybe it's not so fresh.. but you can't ask for too much when you're paying $4 max on a plate. For that reason, I chose to order take out today.",

You would think they would be on top of that and try to get people in and out faster.

The two reasons I wanted to visit this place; cheap sushi and the conveyor belt that the sushi is delivered on.  Very cute and kitschy. This isn't a place to go if you want to impress a date but a great place for friends/family to hang out and get inexpensive sushi.  Loved: what other sushi place serves cream puffs? Granted, it's the same cream puffs that you get in the freezer section of Costco but still - adorable. Your sweet, Teharu and I like you for that.  I am easily entertained and came up with many fun things to do with that conveyor belt that may or may not get me kicked out of the restaurant - things like sending notes with the food to other patrons. Funny, yes. Entertaining for me? Absolutely.   I'll probably go back but it won't be a \"MUST HAVE TEHARU\" craving sensation.",

But hey, I'm a college student and I like to get my low fat sushi fix on a $10 budget sometimes. I'll rate it for what it is: fun and cheap with not the best sushi, but it'll do. If you're not used to revolving sushi places (lots and lots in California), 90% of the time sushi left standing there rotating is not going to fresh and warm. Although fun, if you want sushi a little bit colder you're going to order it from the chef. You're just going to the get the most basic variety of sushi here, and it's mostly the lower grade fishes.   However, it's recipe for fun for groups: cheap instant sushi and Japanese beer readily available. Oh and guess what? J-pop and Anime music playing in the background! As far as service, this place is consistently packed whenever I go, so expect service to be slow.  Bottom line: Cheap fun with friends, but you get what you pay for....not that great of sushi, but it's price is enticing for any poor student such as myself.",

    "text": "I have been here several times since my last review, and while I still like the concept and the food, the service has gone downhill.  The plusses include a drop in prices, meaning that you can definitely have your fill of sushi (a variety in fact) for under $10. Each plate is now between $1 - $2, with most plates falling in around $1.50 (red, green, and white). The last two dinners I've had here were by myself and also with a friend. The total before tip was around $6.50 and $15, respectively.  If what you want is not on the conveyor belt, you can still order from a sushi list for the same price. Definitely try the Amaebi (sweet shrimp) where they take two prawns and chop them in half. The bottom half is eaten raw and the top half with the head is deep fried in batter. Yum!  The soft-shell crab roll can be anywhere between good and awesome depending on which sushi chef puts it together. One day when we ordered this, the presentation was great (legs dangling out of one slice like spiders) and big, another day the rolls were small as if just another mini shrimp tempura roll (and no legs! the best part! ugh!).  Unfortunately, because of the drop in prices (and probably also due to this crappy economy) weekday lunch hours are SLAMMED. The last time I was here for lunch, there were only 2 waitresses attending to the whole restaurant. In the 50 minutes we were there, it took about 10 minutes to receive our waters and wasabi after sitting down and 30 minutes to pay for our food after eating. Nevermind that my water wasn't refilled at all.  I will still come here to eat because of the value and because it's actually decent sushi. However, having lunch here now is definitely out of the question unless I take a lunch around 2-3pm...or have some killer time to burn.",

Sat down by the windows, didn't start picking out the plates of food until we received our drinks.  Each dish cost differently depends on the colors of your plates.  The food is okay, not excellent, but it gets expensive soon after we started eating.

The way they make the nigiri is just done poorly. Not to mention, the freshness of their fish has become questionable. The last time I was there I went with my sister and we had salmon nigiri. The salmon was cut weird, almost like a triangle, and it was falling off the rice. Normally the salmon should have the stripes visible and it should sit comfortable on top of the rice. Anyways, it tasted pretty bad because the fish didn't taste fresh or tasted like salmon at all...and it was a bit chewy... We left right after that. Please note also if you like tuna, notice that it's a brownish red...not bright red. It means it's not fresh anymore so BE CAREFUL! Don't even get me started on the service...awful!!! The staff is not too nice. With this in mind, you have been warned!",

    "text": "Conveyor belt sushi restaurant. Sushi. On a conveyor belt. You really can't get much more simpler than that. At Teharu, you get what you pay for. Don't expect your dragon rolls to be spewing fire or your nigiri to be decorated with any garnishes or anything. If you want crazy fancy fish, go to RA; it's LITERALLY right down the road.  If you or any of your friends are new to the whole sushi thing, definitely try this place out. With the conveyor belt concept, you get to try out a little it of everything (About 3-4 pieces on average from around $1-2). Most of the rolls are pretty much modifications of the California Roll. If the belt looks empty, just try to steal an order sheet and give your waiter your order; *usually* you'll get all your stuff made. Ignoring the insanely long lines on the weekends, the service is not bad. If you want to be seated down quicker with a bigger group, try coming in on a Thursday night around 5:30 or 6. Both conveyor belts are open then.  The service is really nothing to much to brag about. Pretty much all the food is self-served. If you want something from the waiters, ask for it. They can't read your mind. And they all work collaboratively(You don't have one specific waiter serving you in other words).  At the end of the meal, you're probably going to pay under $20 for sushi and leave full. Again, don't expect much. You get what you pay for.",

    "text": "Cliff notes - Cheap: $1-2/plate - Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor - Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol  This place is definitely good for what it is, \"it\" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to \"reduce costs\" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.  On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time).   I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).  For those claiming to be \"left to fend for themselves\" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called \"the menu\" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as \"descriptions\" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF  And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",

    "text": "I have been to this location a number of times,  and each time left with a different opinion of this restaurant. Believe me when I say consistency with regard to service is very inconsistent. The food though,  is generally good for the price. If you have not visited, you owe it to yourself to try it. The restaurant feel is very reminiscent of a Chinese buffet. It is not high end by any means, and servers are there simply to fetch your drinks. Upon sitting (hopefully next to the conveyor belt),  you can immediately enjoy Sushi by picking your desired plate off of the constantly moving conveyor. Choices range anywhere from Chinese soft drinks to fruit juices; from seaweed salad to edamame; from California rolls to jalapenos stuffed with crab meat and fried in tempura batter; from cheese cake to cream puffs. You get the point. Generally your choices are good for an average to low price sushi joint with plates ranging from $1.50 to $2. Food wise, this place is great. A party of two can have their fill for less than $30, and this is eating to fill you up.   Service is often where this place falls flat. Today, I stood at the booth waiting to be seated with clearly several spots open. We were only seated because I grabbed someone from their duty. He asked a woman,  who was standing there staring at us the entire time,  who suddenly gave the nod like a kingpin leader giving approval to whack a guy. Other experiences were great.  Seated quickly. Another bad experience had us waiting for our bill for close to 30 min.   When service is good, expect a great experience. Just don't expect the same treatment the next you come.   Food and price alone earn this place 4 stars. Inconsistency of service knocks it down two. Today's experience was unacceptable.",

As soon as I walked in a person told me in a rude manner to \"come here.\" I looked puzzled and said come here and she said yes come here as if she was talking to a child. I was highly bothered by this and had to fight my natural instinct to \"let her have it.\" Instead I kept my cool and just imagined telling her off. She was very rude and unprofessional throughout the entire interaction. I guess I shouldn't be surprised based on some of the reviews about the poor service other people have received. I wouldn't trust eating here based on the service I received. She needs an attitude adjustment and to be fired and never be in a position where she has to deal with the public. In case the manager or owner wants to know (I doubt it), this happened on 10/23/17 in the early evening.",

We watched as one of the chefs lick his fingers and then resumed rolling sushi with the same gloves. Eventually I had to get up and grab sushi from the first belt before it got soggy and old. The server then came over to laugh at us for grabbing our own food, then over charging us and the icing on the cake: SAID I SHOULD TAKE MY SHIRT OFF!! We left and the only other people on our side of the belt to stay still weren't served in that hour and we were sat after them. I won't be returning to this location.

(And yeah, in case you wondered, my yardstick for a freshnes assesment on a sushi joint is if I had to spend that night curled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor, white as sheet and drained of all color, weakly clutching a wastebasket and praying for the sweet, blessed release of death.  And the good news is that DEFINITELY didn't happen.)  The food was cheap and I really appreciated that part of it as it's getting harder and harder to afford work lunches that consist of something more than a PB&J at my desk.  I think the most expensive item on the rotating sushi belt was about $3 a plate.    The service was friendly and prompt and I have no complaints there.  The only suggestion I'd make is to make sure to have your doors unlocked on the second that you advertise that you are open for business.  I walked up and tried the door at almost 5 minutes past 11:00 and it was still locked and I had to stand there like a fool waiting for someone to come and unlock it and let me in for lunch.  Overall not a big issue, just a minor observation.  Anyway, this was a unique experience for a very small outlay of money, and for me that is a recipe for a return visit!  ;-)",

The great thing about a revolving sushi restaurant is that you don't have to wait for your food. As soon as you sit down you can start grabbing. We tried several different items -the best were the rainbow roll, the potstickers and the tamago, which is a sweet egg sushi that I'd never had before. Overall the sushi was decent, not the best I've ever had but I wasn't really expecting that honestly.   But it's great because you can eat just as much as you want and you can try new things because it's only a buck or two per plate. I thought it was a ton of fun, the food was decent and it's cheap.

It's incredibly inexpensive and the sushi comes on a conveyer belt! What more can you ask for. =P  I think that the sushi itself is quite tasty for the price you pay. Each plate is between $1 to $3. Not to mention they have such a variety of sushi to choose from. Not only is the sushi cheap but even the drinks are reasonably priced! You can get a beer or glass of wine for $4. I usually HAVE to come here at least once a month to get my Teharu fix in for the month because I seriously love this place. I'm little so I'm usually full after maybe $3 or $4 worth of sushi. lol. My favorite roll there is the baked scallop roll. It's basically a California roll with baked scallop on top and it comes out nice and warm for you. =)  The staff is also very friendly and helpful. They're very good at bringing you what you need quickly, no doubt about it.   I think one of the  downfalls is if you come in the evening or on the weekends there is a pretty long wait to get seated. Also, if you come during the day or when it is less busy they don't have a big variety of a sushi selection like they would when it was busy. But don't worry, because it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. =)",

Sushi can be a very expensive venture and this place is cheap and tasty. All the food is pre-made by Mexican women who are more factory workers then sushi chefs. The pre-made plates are rotated on a convayer belt, and you grab plate by plate. Each plate is 1 to 3 dollars.   That being said, stick to lunch and dinner times as sushi seems to sit out for hours here during off hours.   Keeping prices low for consumer is the bottom line here. A plate of gyoza can run a person 6 bucks at other places while it's only 2 here, and it does still taste good. But, the restaurant itself is rough and a bit rundown, staff also seem pretty tired as they are always on the move and probably deserve way more money. I greatly enjoy this place tho, as I can scratch my sushi itch without blowing the bank.",

Her response was its your responsibility, you should have asked. This was the start of our visit..  When we finally were sat down the food was warm and in an unhealthy way. Along with no one knowing whats going on between under trained staff to poor organization.  That gets into the next step where the restaurant allowed 1 party to consume more than 45% of the sitting area leaving everyone else to wait for a spot because what they didnt take in tables they took in chairs...  I was excited to try this place but now im just afraid i might get sick. Do your self a favor and fresher food elsewhere with a hell of a lot better service. (Self checkout on gas station sushi would be better)",

The sushi is not cut with much skill (large chunks, uneven slices).  There was actually a bone in my salmon (traditional sushi, not a roll).  My buddy ordered yellow tail (not available on the conveyor belt)...they brought out a plate with 4 huge chunks, each more than 2 inches thick...almost too large for him to eat, and there were still signs of skin on the fish.  A quick cheap eat...sure no problem, but keep expectations low.",

Wasn't busy like it usually is and the servers were quick to seat us and explain how everything worked. The food was good and fresh and you could see everything happening right in front of us. ( chefs were preparing all the sushi in front of us). I definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for good and inexpensive sushi. We spent a total of $36 and had like 20 plates of sushi. They do have a little sign at the table explaining what each plate costs. The amount of each plate is around $1-$3. So on average you'll spend $1.50 per plate. Which is a very good deal considering how much sushi you get on a plate. Overall it was a good experience !",

Sushi traveling around the restaurant on a conveyor belt while the customers pick what they want to eat; only eat what you pay for and eat only the items that fit in your price range. It's a good concept and is often entertaining.   This location may have messed this up a little bit. I'm not sure if it is just this location or if it was just that evening; the place was empty. The seats were empty, the conveyor belt was empty. We sat and picked a couple of items that we probably wouldn't normally eat, but ate them because we were hungry and that's all they had. Being extremely disappointed at the limited selection, the server finally told us 15 minutes later to order with the chef because they won't be making much for the belt due to the slow evening.   That was fine I guess, but there are better non-revolving sushi places that we could have went to. I wanted the gimmick. I wanted the to see a gallery of food passing before me as I made my decision of which one to devour.   Overall, the food was okay. It wasn't bad, but without the belt, it's just a below-average sushi restaurant.   Good thing is the prices are pretty cheap!",

The quality of the sushi that they make doesn't seem like anything special. The work they put into the food seems like they just make it or make it quick enough to continue feeding customers. The sushi dishes I had looked messy and their roll were not tight enough that each piece I grab, everything tend to fall apart. Or they could be sticking to one another, and they tend to come apart when you're trying to grab a piece. I felt like this place just cares more about just getting people fed than the quality of the food and service they provide for customers. I just think anyone who opens a Japanese restaurants should put more effort into the Japanese culture food because sushi is a big thing in Japan and it's their tradition and culture that they reflect on their food.",

So I sat myself at the bar where all the EMPTY SEATS ARE. She came out rudely yelled at me for sitting myself, she came back with my water and slammed it down in-front of me. WHO TREAT GUEST LIKE THAT? This family with a baby came in and you can hear her yelling to her staff to sit them in the corner cause the baby was crying so if you have young children don't bring them here. Later two guys came in and SHE MADE ME STAND UP AND MOVE OVER SO SHE CAN SAT THEM. When I asked for the menu to order she yanked my order out of my hand and threw it to the lady that was standing inside the bar right over my head.

And the Poppers, I can't remember the first part of the name...these are jalapeno poppers, sushi style. So good! MUST TRY!

The sushi is uninspiring and resides in the ladder end of mediocrity. Long waits on the weekends/nights, coupled with few employees and an un attentive wait staff makes this place fall by the wayside in my book.   However, I will say, if your with a big group of friends who wanna get a quick sushi fix for lunch, this is an excellent option. Everyone can see what they want before they eat it, so it reduces the, \"What's that look like,\" and \"What's in that,\" questions you may come across at a more traditional sushi joint. And of course IT'S CHEAP (but cheap for a reason people so don't expect \"la creme de la creme\"). I've been back a few times with friends who haven't done revolving sush' and I will say, they're consistent in quality.  Good atmosphere, with some aesthetic appeal. The walls are littered with pictures of patrons who have created skyscrapers with empty plates of consumed fish. So if you want your picture on the wall of fame, bring your appetites. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.  - Cheers",

Our personal experience has been that the best time is generally between 6PM and 8PM. To grab fresh stuff off the belt that is.   As mentioned by other reviewers, they'll make rolls fresh for you. The other reviews are all pretty much on the money. It's definitely a fun place to go with friends and affordable. The wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food is a super value, great price for good quality sushi.",

My hubby disliked the sashimi because the ones he grabbed had been on the conveyor too long and were warm. Its biggest feature is also its biggest drawback. They should have some sort of marking system for when dishes go out, so that if they're not picked up by anyone fast enough they toss them.   It took them a while to get the check and they had issues splitting it.",

In other words, she didn't care if the other customers were poisoned!!! We've also noticed that the usual friendly staff seem to have been replaced. We recognized very long-time employees.",

What is wrong with it is the sushi sucked in my opinion. Their tuna sushi which went around the belt several times was grey. That is not appealing to me at all. And I thought their pitchers that they served your drink in looked like someone's water bottle they pulled out of their lunchbox. Did not dig that. Also the staff don't help you so you're left kinda lost to figure stuff out on your own. Teharu you get 2 stars. Fun atmosphere though.Best thing there was the baked clams.",

The conveyor belt is always stocked with a good variety and also have other things besides sushi on the menu.   The service could use a little work.  Had  a couple of people with me and we must have had a lot of plates because my bill seemed a little more than what we had.  So make sure you count all your plates and make sure the ticket matches the food.  I think i paid 10 or 15 dollars more then i ate.  I usually keep track of how many plates and what color so usually know what my bill is.   I will visit when i'm in the area again but will keep track again.",

If you haven't been to this place, let me advise you if you are searching for RA or Blue Wasabi( which is my fav place)  grade rolls & prices then this isn't your place. This place is fast, fun and cheap, that's right cheap and your food is on a conveyor belt!! How cool is that?? You pay by the plate and the most expensive plate is 2 bucks! They have a variety of sushi that can please anyone's appetite. I have to say my top 2 favs are the Haru Poppers, which is crab salad mix stuffed into a jalapeno & dipped in tempura batter & fried (oh sweet heaven!)  and the Haru roll, crab salad mix wrapped in tuna with acovado on top (melt in your mouth good!) I also like the spicy tuna rolls, Vegas rolls, krab rolls, philly rolls, and of course the Cali rolls and edamame. Also they have cream puffs & cheese cake and other various things beside sushi on the belt.  They also have Sake & beers & sodas & teas.  At Teharu you can get full on sushi and barley put in a dent in your wallet!  Sometimes you have to wait for seating, I have come during lunch rushes & dinner rushes and had to wait both times, also when waiting on your check can be time consuming as well. But over all this place has a cool vibe to it and its fun. If you havent tried it, you should.",

Plates of half-rolls or two pieces of nigiri (the fish on rice, if I got that right), as well as drinks, desserts, edamame, and a few other things go around the bar on colored plates (color indicates the price).  Most of the plates are $1-2, some of the best sushi prices I've seen.  The sushi itself is good.  Not fantastic as far as I can tell, but not awful.  I'm no sushi nazi. If you don't see something you want, you can order it at the bar.  They've got a few beers, too.  I really like this place because I can fill up within 5 minutes of entering.  I've gone here a lot this summer, and the service was always good, and the food pretty consistent.",

My husband (a big eater) and I leave *stuffed* for around $25. That's by far the least expensive price we've found for a sushi dinner.  I agree with some of the reviews that said you don't know how long the sushi has been sitting on the conveyor belt. However, I'm guessing those people aren't aware that you can order the sushi you want - and it's made fresh for you. We either keep an eye out for the sushi that has been put out the most recently or ask the chef/waitress for the rolls we want. Just ask for a menu; it shows the different types of rolls you can order.   Tip: go with the \"Haru Sushi;\" it's my favorite!",

I agree not to expect fine-dining but will give you the sushi-fix at a great price.  Also with the revolving sushi - bar concept you get instant gratification (My advice is to wait until something looks really good before picking up - they have some really good stuff but also alot of mediocre sushi on the line.

The sushi is perhaps not world famous quality but I had no issues with it, and I can't say I'm a sushi snob just a sushi lover.  I don't know how often I'll be coming here because it's far from my house but definitely a different experience that I'd do again.  Much like Katie V. suggested it's fun to be able to visualize your sushi and pick and choose and see the plates just piling up. For some you get to feel like a competitive sushi eater...well maybe not but you know what I mean. The service is maybe lacking but if you like to try a little variation on your typical sushi meal this is definitely worth trying.",

If you've never done conveyor belt sushi, you just grab things off the conveyor belt as they roll past you, and you are charged according to the color/size/shape of the plate, depending on where you go.  The sushi here is okay, but just make sure that you grab the ones that are fresh.  I usually just keep an eye on the chef and keep track of what he is preparing.  Sometimes, you'll see the same sushi rolling past you for the 100th time before the chef decides that no one wants it before taking it away, and that, my friends, is void of appeal.  Does anyone else find it hilarious when a kid's fruit cup or a ramune (a Japanese soft drink similar to sprite) roll past you on the conveyor belt in between a california roll and an alaskan roll?  3 stars just for that!",

    "text": "I finally got around to trying out this revolving sushi joint. I was excited because 1. I've never been to a revolving sushi place before and 2. I heard it was cheap. I wasn't disappointed.  We went on a Tuesday night around 7, and while the place was decently busy, we got seated right away. I think it helped that there were only two of us. There are plenty of tables, but if you want to sit right in front of the conveyor then it's probably best to stick to a group of four or less.   We were asked what we'd like to drink, but other than that it's basically a dig in and help yourself kind of place. (And yes, you might have to get your waiters' attention for more drinks or for the bill, but since you're picking out the food yourself, that makes sense to me. It's going to be hard to tell when someone wants something or is done.) Anyway, it's easy to get excited by all the choices going by you and just start grabbing up everything you see. But stuff does come around multiple times, so next time I think I'll pace myself a bit more :)  They pretty much offer standard sushi rolls, nigiri pieces and Japanese appetizers. It's fresh and pretty good considering the prices of the plates. The food comes on either $1, $1.50 or $2 plates. For those prices you get slightly smaller appetizers and the rolls have four pieces, but it's still an amazing deal. Some specialty rolls or items are a little more than that, as signified by being placed on more than one plate.  They also throw some random things in the mix, like Japanese sodas, juice, and I think I saw a fruit cup. But to me, that's just part of the fun.  All in all, I think we stuffed ourselves on almost 20 plates, got two large sakes, and only spent about $40. Had we not completely stuffed ourselves, we could have easily spent less. I'll definitely be back :)",

I was referred to this place by a couple different people and was told it was amazing (although they haven't been here in a while). The first time I ordered about 6 different items and was amazed when my total price came out to about $11. The place was also crowded with a fairly long wait so I assumed the rolls would be coming out fresh.  When I got home my experience quickly changed...I ate a California roll and it tasted fine, not great but not bad, a piece of salmon sushi which was also fine.  I then tried the spicy tuna and it was disgusting!  So fishy that the spices couldn't cover up that taste.  Followed by the tuna nigiri which was also extremely fishy.  Sadly I couldn't even finish half of my order because it contained tuna or spicy tuna.  I decided to try and give it another shot since it was so cheap and just to avoid the tuna altogether. I again ordered about 6 items coming to around $11; when I placed my order I was told they may not have the spicy salmon and asked if it would be fine to replace it with spicy tuna, I quickly said no and provided another possible substitution.  I ordered salmon skin so it took a while (as expected) but I ended up waiting for the spicy salmon at the end; I was advised that \"they were able to find some\" which alone made me extremely nervous.  I finally get my food and head home hoping that this experience would be different than the last. It wasn't. The spicy salmon now tasted fishy and the rice tasted hard and stale. The California roll was so covered in mayo that it wasn't enjoyable, the salmon skin was extremely salty, and the salmon nigiri was slightly fishy.    I do have to say that the staff was very nice and helpful both times I was there which was quite unexpected based on the other reviews.  It would have been great to find sushi for such a low price but there is a reason the great sushi places are much more expensive. I have had a lot of sushi from a lot of different places and I will not return here again, I also would not recommend this place to anyone. I would rather spend twice as much and go to a place like Sushi Eye where I know the fish will taste fresh and delicious.",

    "text": "The ONLY thing that concerns me about a sushi restaurant is the freshness of the fish. I am VERY picky about that. After freshness, I decide whether I'm going back, and how often, by generosity, price and ambiance. The main reason that I'm giving Teharu \"Conveyor-Belt\" Sushi five stars is because I've been there three times now (my husband much more; he goes with coworkers) and I've always been satisfied with the freshness of the fish. The next reason for the high rating is that it's fun, and the third reason is that it's inexpensive.  Note: I've always been there during the lunch rush, when there is high turnover of the food.  I like that my favorite item -- squid -- is just as cheap as everything else. Yesterday they even had little baby squid legs! The items offered at any given time are luck of the draw, so grab what you like when you see it.   The conveyor belt itself is funny. Queues of sushi are punctuated by random solo mutant items like pudding cups, imported soda pop and -- just once -- a can of V8.   There is a badly-xeroxed and inexplicably incomplete guide to roll ingredients on each side of the bar, but you can ask the sushi chefs or waitresses for ingredients.   I'm not sure why people said the service was poor; there really isn't any service to give, other than drink refills and the occasional clearing of lids, and these are done promptly. (You keep your plates in a stack so the waitresses can count them up at the end. You're charged by the plate - $1, $1.50 or $2 - depending on the plate color.) Maybe they were sitting at the regular tables.  Teharu Sushi is a fun place to take an out-of-town guest or client. If you're skeptical, try it at least once! It's not the most delicious tuna or salmon you've ever had, but I've always found it to be fresh, it's a cool experience, and it's very affordable.",

Also echo the other comments about rude or weird waitstaff.  My experience was this was I was sitting and waiting for a dish to come around when I was approached by a woman who told me she could order something for me, but did so in a tone of voice that a kindergarten teacher might use to inform Billy that if he needs to go to the bathroom he can raise his hand.  \"These stupid customers\" oozed out of her.  I'll go back and try it again (2x already).  But one or two more crappy experiences with the staff and that'll be it for me.",

Thanks to the folks on either side of us, we'll go for some of the specialties they suggested the next time.  We went at about 6pm on Monday and the wait wasn't bad.  By the time we finished, there were several parties waiting, but we were told that Saturday nights there are usually people wating outside.  We will go back again!",

It's always crowded when I go, but they only seat people at the \"bar\" are where the conveyor belt is. Granted that's what most people are there for, but it seems there is a conveyor belt(s?) that go around the majority of the restaurant, but only the one around the bar is ever in use. Last time I was there,  someone in another party had to ask for a booth to be bussed after it sat there for 20 minutes untouched, my name got skipped on the list so 4 people that came in after us got seated before us. I said something to two different servers and was told \"oh sorry, I don't know how you were skipped, you'll be next\" before we actually got seated. The first time I went, I had a similar experience but thought it would be a fun place to take a friend. This second time proved that it's not worth going out of my way for",

They have another side with chairs which I almost never see utilized. Instead they they use one half of the restaurant to seat people. When you get there you almost always have to sign a list with your name and party size. Then wait on the side like the kid last picked at recess watching all the other people eat. Meanwhile they have plenty of room on the other side to sit...but it's never open. You can't even sit down at a table and be offered a water you just sit and wait until other people have had their fill. Luckily I've never gone with more than one other person. I bet it's awful if you had a large party you would likely have to wait 20min or more.  When it can easily be avoided all together by opening up more seating. Despite other reviews I've seen I wouldn't recommend going at busy hours if you're really hungry and with a large group.",

When my coworker invited me to check out this place with her I jumped at the chance.  Although I was a little nervous that it was so cheap, I was determined to replace my qualms with a sense of adventure. Luckily, we arrived for lunch at 11:00, I know it's early but by 11:30 eager sushi eaters started coming out of the woodwork and had to wait for a seat.  As we sat down the server took our drink orders and gave us our drinks rather quickly.  That was the last time we saw her until the check came.  I can't say enough good things about what it's like to sit down at your table and already have the food in front of you.  The first thing I tried was the salmon sashimi it was honestly one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had.  Next I tried the tuna sashimi, meh, not so much.  Everything after that was delicious.  My coworker and I just kept grabbing and grabbing.  The plates ranged from $1.00 - $2.00.  When our bill came it was $26, for both of us!  Stop what you're doing and go eat there, you will not be disappointed.",

A large conveyer belt snakes its way through the restaurant, encompassed by bright yellow walls that look like Pikachu took a thundershock dump on the joint. Okay-- so the interior decorators didn't get it right, but the cuisine they most certainly did.    I sit and stare, the sushi plates ride down the conveyor belt at a steady pace.

Price is low and allows you to start lunch/dinner right away which is nice when you are hungry. You may have to wait until what you like goes nearby though as you have a lot of options to choose from.  I like the baked scallops and sometimes they are none on the belt so you can ask directly your waitress for it and they'll bring it to you directly at your table, which is nice.  Most of the rolls are 4 pieces, which is okay for the price you pay. Stacking up the plates if a fun exercise and you can see pictures with a lot of plates from customers.  Lunch can be busy and waiting is not uncommon but it goes usually pretty fast and voila, you are part of the bang wagon!  You won't find individual rolls here like you would as Sushi Eye, it's 100% conveyor. No Hand rolls either, deal with it!  I like the concept as far as it stays cheap but good enough to come back again. Don't expect extravaganza here, bells and whistles are out of the equation.

I called this place for several days to make a reservation for my curious diners of 10 and not once was that phone picked up on the other end.  Maybe the ringer was on silent! Well, we showed up, signed in and waited in line. I was nervous because I wanted all of us to sit together.   I got the attention of a waitress to tell her about our dilemma and she said, \"Yeah, we take large groups but you have to make a reservation.\" Really? What a novel idea. Imagine my frustration. I told her to make it work.  Surprisingly, our wait was less than half hour.   So, you could say we all sat together if only the conveyor belt was not running between our two tables.  I guess it was the best they could do \"last minute.\" Nonetheless, we made the most of it.    I was apprehensive about the service from all the reviews I've read, but I must say the waitstaff was on their best behavior.  I thought they were friendly.  I find that it's quite True about where you sit because most of the sushi we grabbed were cold. We were closer to the end of the belt! But we love the saki. We even did some bomb sakis for fun.  Overall, it was a cool spot and a nice experience!",

If they mispronounce it and you don't catch it immediately they will move right down to the next person on the list. =)  We have a few favorites and you simply cannot beat the price for the variety that this serving style allows. They also accept any special orders and make them quickly. My boyfriend always orders 2 spicy tuna handrolls and they make 'em huge!   As long as you pay attention you can be sure not to get the warm types that have already cooled. Overall, Teharu is a great little place. Anyone we've ever referred agrees!",

We has lunch there today and ate until we were very full... like \"I can't eat another bite full\".. and our bill was $28.50 and $4 of that was drinks.

It's a lot of fun to sit there with friends and just grab plates as they come by. It's the most adventurous I'd ever been with sushi, since I could SEE it, I felt more confident in grabbing it. It's cool cause each person can keep their own plate stack, which makes it easy to split the bill. Plates range in price from $1 to $2...some things were on two plates so they were *GASP* $3. Between that and the beer special ($4 for a large Kirin light) - it was a steal.   Totally recommend it for a cheap night out with a group of friends!",

They had seating open for only half the restaurant when it was super busy. It's not the first time this has happened & it is super upsetting. I understand the staff is trying their best & people take too long to eat & socialize after but they need to do something about this. We waited for more than an hour and a group who came waaaay after us got seated before us. If they waited just a little for the belt seating or saved a table and added chairs, we could have easily been seated. Instead, they put me and my party off to where we were literally the second to last ones waiting to eat sushi. I give the staff and service a one star but the sushi is 4/5",

Why I really, REALLY like Teharu: The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from. All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, they'll gladly make it for you. The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down! The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip. The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones.  Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time.",

On my second visit, the line was out the door and people milling everywhere waiting for a table, they didn't want to open the 2nd half of the restaurant (even though that's also run on a conveyor belt).  Again, the wait staff was completely clueless and we couldn't get them to respond to any of our requests.  I do like their squid salad, bake mussels and a couple of their rolls.  Their prices are cheap and it's fun to see your food coming and just pull things off the conveyor belt as it goes by.  What kills me that the people who work there seem like they would rather be somewhere else and can't be bothered to give you the time of day.  Overall, I would def come back...but expect to be ignored anyway so I won't be disappointed.",

When it is fresh, it's amazing. Their specialty: Haru, unagi, squid salad, and gyoza are my favorites here. I've been to 7+ conveyor belt sushi places and this has been the best at the lowest prices.

Choose from standards such as nigiri, cali rolls, and gyozas to ridiculousness like V8, fruit cups, and cream puffs.  Wash it down with some Japanese marble soda or just a good ol sake bomb.    The value is fantastic; each plate you pull costs you $1-$2, with a plate generally consisting of 2-4 pieces of sushi or a few ounces of salad.  You can stuff yourself silly here for under $20, can't do that at any other sushi place unless you suffer from anorexia nervosa.    A bottle of unagi sauce comes with every table (heart)  The main tradeoff is that the quality's not as good as you'll find at a higher-end sushi establishment, but still very edible.  Also the place gets  zerged during dinner hours so be prepared to wait a bit even on a Wednesday or Thursday.   Service can be slow sometimes so bring a bit of patience.  Give this place a try so they make more $$$ and can open a second spot further up north =D",

However, I have to agree with the comment that they are \"as fine as McDonald's\" because the sushi I had there wasn't very tasty.   However, their greatest faux pas is not mediocre sushi; it's location. If they were up by ASU, there's no question they would be busier. But they are way out in a strip mall in SW Tempe, and I was one of only two customers at the dinner hour. I hope they get more of a lunch crowd.  If I were them, I'd 1) change location. They're open til 11pm, so they should be around a college or more populated area. 2) put sensor strips on the bottom of the plates so they can tell how many times the sushi has gone around. The same plates kept going by the whole time I was there, and who knows how long they had been on the belt. 3) The unagi I had was pretty good, but the tamago was tasteless. Figure out which items are tasty and which could be improved. Then improve them.",

Stuff like maguro, sake (salmon), shrimp, and an endless number of \"rolls\". They also have cheesecake, cream puffs, and little kiddie drinks like Lamune if you need the sugar fix. They charge by the colors of your plates. I don't remember what the color scheme and pricing chart is but all I know is 2 people can eat till being stuffed for as cheap as 20 bucks. That's Kaitenzushi (revolving sushi) for you. That's gotta mean something in this economy right? That's probably why it's always packed when I go. If you go at some prime time be prepared to write your name on the waiting list and wait 15 minutes or so.

Nothing like a lukewarm mouthfull of clam, or tuna, or everything. All the fish was mealy tasting because of this.    Again, it's really cheap though, so think of buffet style sushi without the benefit of an ice bath.

    "text": "Ok, I went here for the first time last Friday with some people from work. We got there early to avoid too much of a crowd. The night before I had read some previous yelp reviews and the overall theme seemed to be \"Good food, poor service\". Well, I will be another to add to that. I am not a sushi fan, but there was a menu with a few other items you could get. I got the shrimp tempura with a side of rice. By the way, the menu says the rice is $1, but don't be surprised when it says $1.50 on the bill and they don't care when you ask about it. \"The price has gone up\" and pointing out that the menu is incorrect gets you nowhere. Again, very poor customer service. (For me it was the principle of the thing, not the $.50.) Anywho, shrimp was awesome. I even got some pot stickers off of the conveyor belt that were great.   Getting someone to help you can be very difficult. There was one server, who was not ours, who graciously helped us when we could not find our gal. Unfortunately, he only helped through taking our order and then we had to wait for the invisible woman to bring the food out. There were 10 of us at 2 tables of 5 each, so I usually give a little leeway, but there were tables seated after us who were getting their food before us and others that got their checks before us (which was a pain in it's own right).  Overall, would i go again? Yes, but only if I made sure I had plenty of time. The food really is that good. Just remember to put on your patience panties and suck it up. If you aren't in the mindset to deal with this nonsense, best go elsewhere that day.  Another thing of note, if your party has more than 3 people, good luck trying to sit at the bar. They will make you sit at a table. Humph. We wanted the bar. It was not in the cards.",

I frequent Raw and Sushi101 and the quality is definitely comparable. Special secret: ask for the hand roll menu if you're not into the whole revolving sushi bar thing. Personally, I love their Vegas rolls and Rainbow rolls. Crunch roll is always a safe option as well! Super casual- Pop music usually playing and almost always packed for dinner. Definitely get here before 5 if you're not one to wait.   Only downfall- slow turnover, which contributes significantly to the wait. Not recently but a couple of years ago, I remember waiting over 45 minutes to get the check however, it seems to be improving. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu.   I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...?  Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss.   I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad.  When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve.   Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me.   So long story short. Try it for the experience but don't expect much cause you know, for the price and all.... ( last part was sarcasm if you didn't catch it )",

They charge $1 extra for it, but whatever that's fine. Now the only thing that really annoys me is the lack of communication and bad customer service with the employee's. One day I'm told I have to pay extra for sauces and the next day I'm told no that's not policy it was a battle every time I was in there. It seems like it depended on which employee would ring me up, it was super annoying. There is an employee I can't remember her name such a shame because she was such a sweetheart every time I ordered my food from her I never had a problem. It's hard to rate this place but I would say customer service 2 stars with the exception of the young lady she deserves 5 stars. And food rating I would say 5 stars what can I say the rainbow roll with spicy tuna is my weakness lol. This place also is great if your trying sushi for the first time it has different levels of sushi plates. For example you can start with just a white plate those are cheaper and aren't that crazy with raw fish or sauces the plates are more on the plain side, kind of like an introduction to sushi. Btw the plates are in different colors which it's a very nice system so your aware of the pricing. Well I can go on and on about this place, until now in total I will be giving 3 starts hopefully customer service can improve and the other employees learn from the young lady. P.S she's more on the younger side, has black glasses and ponytail most of the time.",

I waited over twenty minutes for one roll, which came out cold, while the gentleman I asked was listening to music behind me sitting in a booth, had to ask several times for eel sauce, waited over 40 minutes for a seat while several larger parties went before us when we checked in first then the waiter offered to bring us food at the waiting booth, and all the cold sushi that should have been warm you could imagine.

The conveyor belt and cheap sushi is the only thing they have going for them. The sushi IS cheap, so no, I don't ever expect much quality out of it, but it's fun to eat cheap and pick whatever you want. But the staff, I've just had too many irritating encounters. They won't come outside to call names on the list (if you're not inside attentively listening, too bad so sad they'll skip you), they don't ever properly seat you anymore, only loosely point in a vague direction, we've asked to put in an order and instead of asking us what we'd like, this waiter turned for the paper menu and handed it to us and left, tried to order miso soup and was told \"I'm not a waiter\", we've ordered sushi and actually waited over half an hour for it and it was not crazy busy. We've even tried to call in to order food and the same rude waiter said \"it's gonna be awhile\" and was put on hold without taking our order, so we hang up and just decide to order it at Teharu to go, and upon pulling into the parking lot, it's not even that busy. Obviously I do continue to go, these are all very separate occurrences, but I'm just overall disappointed in the staff. It seems like the ones that are actually friendly are very timid, but the rude ones will give you all kinds of attitude. I never feel welcomed when I come here, and I don't expect it anymore.",

And for some odd reason half the restaurant is just regular tables, but no one sits there bc obviously... you want to be at the conveyor belt where the sushi is.

As soon as I got it in my hand it came apart leaving me with a sloppy mess all over the little plate.

I mean, if they can't make it right in the kitchen, how is it gonna be on a roving belt?  My worries were for naught.  Despite the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 7:45pm (yes, it was that crowded), and having trouble finding it (there is no sign from the street -- you HAVE to know where it is), it was all worth it.  My companions (all fish eaters but me) LOVED it. They said the fish was fresh, delicious, exciting etc. I loved the seaweed salad and edamame to start, and then went for two dishes of Inari, a place of veggie rolls, and then wound up ordering 3 orders (so a total of 12 individual) avocado rolls, because none were coming around.  All that, plus iced tea, cost me $16.  AMAZING.  My partner ate all sorts of rolls; her favorite was the I Love Salmon Roll and also the Caterpillar Roll, although she enjoyed the Rainbow Roll and Dragon Rolls as well.  Wasn't impressed with the Las Vegas Roll, and wished that they had more exciting, different, unique rolls (they had one; the Haru Sushi, which she did enjoy).  Her total, with iced tea? $18. Seriously. Oh, and we shared a place of cream puffs for dessert.  There were no plates more than $2. The cheesecake had two $2 plates, making it 4, but other than that, nothing, including special orders, was more than $2.  The avocado rolls I had were some of the best I've enjoyed (they were bursting full of avocado, instead of one small piece), and the Inari was delicious. Ginger on the table (as well as unagi sauce and soy sauce), quick to fill up iced tea. I was in heaven.  I do wish they'd have more vegetarian rolls so I didn't have to order them. The whole time we were there, only one veggie roll went by - the one I ate.  No cucumber, avocado, daikon, etc unless you ordered them. I also wish Wasabi was on the table, instead of brought to you in a hunk; I didn't want to use it all at once, but I had to take it out of my dish to save for later and put...where?  Also, I loved the \"other\" options, like juice, V8, Ramun (Japanese soda), pudding cups, fruit, cheesecake and more on the belt. Gave lots of options.  It did take forever to get our bill, but all that aside, we will most definitely be back.",

The only reason they do not get 5 star is that we had a large group (with a reservation) and they did not open the other half of the restaurant to make it easy for everyone to see the food. so now with 15 people stick out from the conveyor the first to sit down had to grab and pass down orders for everyone else. makes enjoying your food really hard.",

Not Teharu, almost every plate is under three dollars...the problem is controlling yourself from overeating because of the prices. I don't think i've ever had a bill larger than $10 for myself and thats pushing it. The staff is wonderful and if there is a wait they are happy to seat you as quickly as possible. If the roll that you want isn't on the conveyer belt, all you have to do is order it from the waiter or if you are seated at the bar ask the chef. I also love that they keep a bottle of unagi sauce on the table--I put that on everything!",

For picky eaters and folks who don't know much about sushi, it is difficult to know what the ingredients are just by looking at it. 3. Definitely not the best sushi place around, but they said they were. 4. The colors on the plates are not as obvious as they used to be.",

To me, it's not worth the wait. It's cheap sushi sure, but you get what you pay for, find another cheap sushi place for less of a wait. I don't recommend this place to anyone anymore.",

We arrived at about 3;30 Nov 3 on a Sunday and waited for a seat at the rotating sushi bar , as we waited I started noticing the tacky decor and obnoxiously load music that did not fit a sushi bar at all (PLEASE TURN DOWN YOUR MUSIC) when we sat I noticed the food looked \"old\" and not much to choose from, I thought well it is 3;30 , right between lunch and dinner BUT it's Sunday and people go out to eat at all times on this day.   The rice for the sushi was clumpy and tasteless , the fish was NOT up to even my standards and I'm no way a sushi snob, It just did not taste fresh .   So I ordered the spicy Ramen noodles ($5) off the menu which said they were Korean style. If those noodle were Korean then I'm a lock for being the next President, these noodles are exactly like the top ramen noodles you buy for 10 cents in a grocery store (swear to God , don't believe me waste $5 and see for yourself) with a few chopped chives and scallions but you can make these noodles at home . Anyone  reading this should be offended by their offering of noodles and saying anything but these noodles are grocery store style noodles.  Lastly the customer service (or lack there of) I get this place is self serve but after we ordered our drinks there was absolutely none. I had a beer and was never asked if I wanted another , I know I could of asked for one myself  but after the sub-par food and store bought noodles I just wanted out , My daughters boyfriend said this place use to be way better. All I know is  they will never get my hard earned vacation money again.",

There is a new server who literally put my kid in his place, scooting his chair up to the table and telling him to eat... some parents may be upset, but I think my kid needed to hear it from a different adult.  LOL. So I didn't mind.  Decent sushi at a reasonable price.  We go here often.  My only concern is that since it is served off of a conveyor belt, sometimes the sushi is room temp and the items that are supposed to be hot are cold.  We always order off of the sushi menu.  We do love it though.  Great for a much needed sushi fix.

I was also really excited to experience the rotating sushi bar for the first time. They had a sign that said sign in and sit down. There was a family immediately after us. When the waitress came, she didn't look at the sign in and just ignored us and right before seating the family she last minute asked who was first. So we sit down and politely asked for waters and a menu with prices and a graph that explains the different prices to the different plate colors so we know what to pay. She said ok and brought the water. we asked about the menu again and she said ok. We were then ignored for 20 mins. We found a menu laying on a table on the other side which didn't have prices and no one helped us for 20 mins. We didn't get any food. We kept trying to make eye contact and politely ask the chefs making the rolls and no one could help us or tell us the prices. So after being ignored and seeing our waitress decide to bus tables instead of getting us a menu, we left. We were very frustrated and confused as to why were ignored and why the service was HORRIBLE! The food looked decent but we didn't even get a chance to eat it because we were blatantly ignored.

YES!  Their special item is Teharu sushi, which is a piece of fish (salmon or tuna) wrapped with really creamy California roll stuffing topped with slices of avocado and a drop of teriyaki sauce. It has to be requested, as it isn't available on the conveyor belt. I highly recommend it!  Service is also very quick and friendly. If anything is not on the conveyor belt, you can request it from one of the sushi chefs or waiters. I've been happy and satisfied with their service each and every one of the gazillion times I've been here.   To be quite honest, I almost wanted to be selfish and not review this restaurant fearing it will help attract more patrons, thus compromising the quality and price. But Yelp has been good to me, so this is my way of giving back. :D",

I tend to stick with the Philly roll because they put more cream cheese than most sushi places.  I love that because I love cream cheese.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the wait can be a challenge and you can never be sure how long certain rolls have been sitting out.",

Plus most sushi places I go to, I can only eat two or three different rolls because they usually come with six to eight pieces. Most plates at Teharu come with only four pieces, so I can have more variety. The sushi is great, but sometimes it's better than others depending on what time of day you go. The busier it is, the more frequently they are putting out fresh rolls. The staff is always friendly and constantly refilling drinks. If you love sushi but don't want to spend a bunch of money, then this is the perfect place. My fiance and I eat a decent amount and it usually costs around $20-$25 including drinks.",

    "text": "Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.  20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \"large parties\" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.  So here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning.",

Best part is its cheap, if your looking for bang for your buck this is definitely the place, dont expect quality though! Its very cool to be able to eat sushi cheap and try a ton of different kinds of rolls, but when you have had good sushi its hard to go to this lower quality taste. Yes its awesome, the sushi is on a conveyor belt, tons of different rolls to choose from and you can actually see it and pick it up and try it. Yet the taste, just room temperature, bland and squishy. I do think this is a great way to start out trying sushi for the first time! It was frustrating that most of the signs were old/rubbed off so you couldn't see what they said to figure out if you wanted to try the roll or not, or remember it for the future at different places. The staff working this day didn't speak a lick of English, which can be super frustrating when you are just asking for a water and you cant explain that any different. They had pudding and cheese cake on the belt for dessert which I found funny, but I tried it and its basically a piece from a store bought cheese cake. Funny part, since no one spoke English I couldn't get a fork, also they were really bad at paying attention to customers who needed things. They kept disappearing, very bad customer service. so anyway, I had to eat my cheese cake with my fingers! Try eating cheese cake with chop sticks..... doesn't work, fingers thanks for the help! LOL! After almost finishing my piece of cheese cake she saw me eating with my hands so she brought over a fork! A little late, I was done shoveling it in my mouth haha. If you want cheap Saki Bombers and Sushi, come here for sure, good deals! Looking for a cheap date, this is your place. Still an overall meh with me! I like more quality in my food!",

Service was ok, but I didn't appreciate ice water being spilled all over my 7 month old son. Also, the little plates of sushi have lids on em. I understand you need the colored plates to figure out what to charge, but do we need the lids cluttering up the table? We don't need a bunch of trash all over the table. Take this away!  Sushi quality was fine. Not the best, not the worst. The price is very reasonable for the quality, so I was happy with that. Also, though it was weekend lunch time, and there were some customers, it was fairly quiet which was great.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick sushi fix for a reasonable price, this is a decent choice.",

They keep half the restaurant closed so the wait is unnecessarily long.  The service isn't great,  we often spend most of the time without getting refills on our drinks. Long story short,  good,  simple cheap sushi.  May go elsewhere soon if they keep closing off half the restaurant though.  Editing after dinner: the conveyor was empty almost the entire time we were here.  We never received two of the rolls we ordered and never received refills on our drinks.  We have even waiting 15 minutes to get our check to leave. This may be our last visit. Teharu has truly gone downhill.",

The options also were not very appealing to me. You can order and have items freshly prepared too, but I feel like that defeats the purpose. Even though the prices are low, I still don't think it's worth it for the quality and amount of the food you are getting, since each plate is often just half of a roll or a really small roll. I would normally pay $24 for two full and hefty rolls at other restaurants, and this always is enough for me. At Teharu, I could easily order eight plates of $3 rolls, but the quality and freshness of the sushi would not be as good. The atmosphere also isn't the best. The seats and tables look and feel really worn, and the seating arrangement for the conveyor belt makes it inconvenient for larger groups.",

The conveyer belt adds a bit of fun and it is nice to be able to start eating as soon as we sit down.   The biggest downside to Teharu is that everyone else likes them too, so they are always busy.",

    "text": "A last minute decision to come to Teharu Sushi turned out to be an awful one. It being a Sunday evening with a majority of restaurants closing early, we didn't have too many options so we came here.  We arrived two hours before closing and the restaurant was empty with the exception of the very few tables occupied. There were 4 sushi chefs working behind the conveyor belt yet none of them welcomed any of us upon walking in.  Having been to other rotating sushi locations in So Cal, Teharu sushi has limited options available and their kitchen items menu is pretty non existent. The plates cost between $1-$2. Everything on the belt was basic; California, spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow and spicy crab. In regards to the taste, the quality was poor as the seafood did not look fresh. Even the rice fell apart upon taking a bite.  Service was extremely poor. The server kept forgetting our orders, accidentally dropped our order on the floor and at times had to be approach to ask for items such as more napkins and drink refills. With the manager sitting directly across from our table, she decided to ignore our party while she continued to dine on her meal though it was obvious we were frustrated with the lack of service and disappointment in food.   Never would I return to such a place that could careless about the food they serve or paying customers.",

We arrived at 5, and there was about 3 pieces of actual sushi going around the belt for about 30+ minutes (see picture) when I finally got the attention of the staff, asking for a water and when sushi would come out, and she wordlessly handed us a special order form. We filled out a few different types of sushi we wanted, got one, waited another 20+ minutes (watched some of the things we ordered be put on the belt but didn't grab them before they were gone cause we didn't want to double up on our orders). Finally we asked and they gave us one of the other 4 rolls we were waiting on and we decided to cut our losses and leave, sadly.  I wish I could whole-heartedly recommend this place like I would have before. The sushi is still good and good price.",

    "text": "I rarely leave reviews, but when I'm treated as poorly as I was tonight, I feel my experience should be shared.   My family came in tonight and asked for a table for 8. We were led to a table made for 6 and watched as an employee moved two chairs to the end of the table (the other end of the table was against the sushi conveyer belt). These two chairs were literally touching the chairs at the end of the long sides of the table, leaving absolutely no place to put your legs.   So I said to the employee, \"Um, if you set up the chairs like this, where should we put our legs?  Is there a better solution for a table of 8?\"  He asked me to hold on and went to speak to someone else.   Moments later, an older woman came over to us with a very aggressive attitude and said, \"Ma'am, if you don't like our service, you don't have to eat here,\".  I was completely taken aback by her approach and tried to explain that I was only asking if there was a better set-up for our party. She continued to berate me, making fun of my facial expression and telling me that this set-up was the only way to seat 8.  I told her I didn't have any issue with the set-up if it was the best they could do...I was honestly just asking. She walked away and we sat down.  Then the woman approached our table *again* and told us that we didn't need to stay if we didn't like their service.   A restaurant telling me twice that they don't need my patronage is enough for them to lose my business forever, so we left. I will never - EVER - set foot in that restaurant again.",

When we left, they had closed the west side of the conveyor so there were about 25 peeps waiting for a table.   Conveyor belt sushi is always a mixed bag.  It's the Winco of sushi, so you serve yourself but don't expect the quality stuff you get at your favorite place.  The draw for these is: you get to try different rolls for a minimal investment (about $2 per plate).  Between us we racked up 13 plates and it came to about $27 plus tip.   The service here is among the worst I've seen. You get your table, your drink and then the only sound you hear is the quiet hum of the conveyor going past your table. No service at all, unless they need your table, which they did.   Some of the better rolls, IMO: Philly, Tiger and Las Vegas.",

I feel like that minimize the items they make during dead times which is fine, but use fresh fish, not something that looks like it's been sitting out for hours. Here's hoping I don't get food poisoning. Travel down Ray a little bit and find way more sushi places at the same prices.",

Little to my surprise that this was the worst sushi restaurant I have eaten at. The sushi was not only small portions, but low quality. The sushi wasn't even cool, and there were few options to even choose from. The customer service was horrible as well. We only received one drink and never received a check up on how we were until we were already waiting 15 minutes for our check. $19 for a sushi date is a deal, I get that, but I prefer quality over cheaper price. Go to Kiku revolving sushi instead! *not affiliated with any restaurants*",

It's usually pretty busy, but you'll get seated fast enough. People are in and out quickly. The staff is kind but not intrusive. The sushi isn't gourmet, but it's good for the very low price. You can fill yourself up for less than 10 dollars.  If you can, sit towards the right side of the restaurant, as you enter. You'll want to be towards the bar as the items there are freshest. The left side under the TV gets last choice of the items. If you get seated there - no sweat - just flag a waiter and order something direct from the kitchen no extra charge (these direct orders are the best anyway). Recommend the Haru Poper, if you're OK with the spice. The Vegas rolls are good too (especially when fresh).  Great quick and inexpensive sushi bar. Mostly for the price I give it 4 stars.",

However, I'm writing to comment on the customer service, which basically doesn't exist. The servers are never overly friendly, and there is one female server who is downright rude. We've joked for a long time about how moody she is but our most recent visit was ridiculous and I've finally decided it's time to call her out on Yelp. During this visit, she was curt and abrupt with us from the start even though it was not very busy in the restaurant at the time. She slammed our waters down on the table and would not acknowledge my husband when he tried to give her an order sheet. He ended up handing it to the chef directly. She then tried to count our plates before we were done, even though it was clear we were not finished. When my husband told her we were still eating, she stomped off like a spoiled child. By the time we were ready to check out, she flat-out ignored us, and it took several minutes to get her to come tally our bill. The only times she spoke to us were when she asked what we'd like to drink and then if we were finished. She acted as though we had insulted her from the start and I'm pretty sure we didn't do anything but walk in the door. Because this place is often busy, I don't think they have to worry about her bad customer service running people off. However, she is there to take care of the patrons and Teharu would be better off if she were gone. We will continue to go in spite of her bad attitude, but our visits would be much more pleasant if she was, too.",

That being said, there are some guidelines that I recommend following to ensure you get fresh sushi.   #1-anything fried, which should be hot, you should definitely order fresh... unless you actually see them put a new line of plates out on the conveyer belt. You can do this by asking one of the waiters/waitresses, or the cooks behind the counter.   #2- don't grab the last of anything. To me, that means it has gone around a few too many times. Again, if you saw them put it out, the rule doesn't apply.   #3- go during a busy time of day. Yes, you'll probably have to wait a little bit for a seat. But the sushi is being turned over faster.   #4- there's a secret menu! I recommend the volcano roll. Careful though, it comes out hot!   No, this is not my FAVORITE sushi place out there,  because the quality isn't the highest. But when I want to get my sushi fix on a dime, this is the place I go.",

They just literally don't notice you walk in.   We've had to just seat ourselves after a few minutes of just standing around being stared at.   The food is not really fresh. There are only a handful of dishes worth eating and the cheesecake is pretty good to. All the fried dishes are cold and the salads are sad and wilted.

One time I counted it going around 11 times! Second reason, if you order to go it's way better quality. It's specifically made for you. I order to go at least 3 times a week here. I only down around 12 or less every time I come. Very inexpensive. But if you come in to sit down they will ignore you for about 20 min lol. Sit your self down if you see open sitting ! I have before.  The sushi quality isn't amazing! But it's very very good for the price. Love love love it!",

Teharu is decent nothing more, nothing less.Nothing will make you sit back and go OMG this yellowtail just melted in my mouth its soooo fresh, but then again, few places will.  Its fast, cheap and fun to see the sushi rolls come zooming out on a conveyor belt.  The plates are all color coded, with different colors meaning different prices[ie blue-2]  If you want something extra fresh ,simply order it.  A word of warning- friday night, or saturday night?You are in for a loooong wait, and it gets -very- loud, with K pop blasting from the speakers at pop your eardrum volume.A romantic date place, this is not.A quick way to get your sushi fix and not be sick for days?Yep.  I'm quite fond of this place, and my teen son LOVES it.",

I usually have to request them and they always taste great. Not the best, but considering its 2 dollars for 4 pieces of a dragon roll, that is a screaming dea! I always put a little sriracha on my dragon rolls and a little extra eel sauce and I love'em. I work nearby and come here at least once a week. I look at this as the equivalent of fast food sushi, not the best, but still damn tasty. I and my co-workers have never gotten sick eating here. This place is only good for the sushi and haru poppers.   I do recommend ONLY sitting along the primary table area. There are two conveyor belts and they are not linked. The best and freshest sushi seems to always be by the area where they make it.  The wait staff is hit or miss, but the cooks are fantastic and cool to talk too and watch them do their thing. This is a great place to come eat as you can get back before your 1 hour lunch is over. I have only ever eaten here during lunch time between 11-1. It can be crowded but the longest wait I saw was 15 mins, during the week.",

As long as it is busy, the food stays fresh.  Some of the concoctions are not very tasty, but perhaps someone other than myself would find it delicious.     I can't give it 5 stars since I've had not so good experiences there in the past AND they never give enough wasabi, but the place is cheap and fast, so 4 stars it is.",

    "text": "Been here multiple times, still one of the best revolving sushi around town. This place is usually busy but if you get there just before it opens than you will be seated right away.  The atmosphere is pretty good, prices cheap, food is good, and service is good. When coming in the restaurant is pretty big, probably too big for the actual used space. They have one main rotating sushi bar where everyone sits around and grabs things off the conveyer. That only takes up half the room; the other half isn't really used since most people want to sit near the conveyer. I believe they should do a remodel to kind of utilize that unused space; this way they can add more larger tables on both sides for bigger parties while getting the benefit of the conveyer.  Food there tastes a whole lot better than other revolving sushi I've tried, and they keep adding other selections to their menu. I definitely recommend getting the Haru sushi, and if it isn't on the belt then order it from the waitress.  Portion of each dish ranges from 2-4 pieces depending on which thing you get. Price per dish is reasonable ranging from $1-3 dollars. I could easily rack up a $15-20 dollar bill on my own if I don't pace myself.  Service here is generally good, once they seat you and ask if you want anything to drink, they pretty much leave you alone. I suppose that could be a good or a bad thing depending on how people view it. I personally like to be left alone while I'm eating. I think it's nice that they leave you alone here to eat, but they need a little improvement; there have been times where I've had to flag down the waitress to get in an order or get our check.  Overall, I will continue to go back here anytime I have the craving for some cheap sushi.",

I've had a lot of very good, high quality sushi from all over the country and have no problem coming here anytime to grab dinner and be satisfied.  The vibe, the atmosphere is fantastic. Typically very friendly when you come in the front door. Very typical, and welcome greetings from the entire staff when you enter. The food as mentioned is very good and especially when you start to consider the prices. The cost (determined by color of plates floating by) are very low for the food you are getting.  I couldn't be happier with this place, the staff and the service. Anytime I have visitors here from LA, Texas, I make sure to take them and they are always blown away.. and frankly jealous I get to live merely minutes from here!  If you're coming with a larger group, keep a heads up that you won't see immediate seating since this place is made mostly for smaller parties of 4 or so.",

Well, when we found this place, my husband and I couldn't resist and decided to give it a try.  When we arrived, it was really busy, the seats around the \"bar\" area was completely full, but it looked like some people were getting ready to leave.  Eventual, it came time for us, and we were seated at the very end of the belt, right before it disappeared into the back.    At first, it seemed there was a good selection, we began to pull off plates, and then we began to realize that everything was spicy.  Then one by one, we began to regret our choices, the fish didn't seem so fresh, and anything that wasn't spicy, was not too fresh, I guess they make it all spicy to hid the old stuff.  I think it was a good try, but doesn't hold up to our standards, we have had some great sushi, so this isn't our kind of place.",

Mr. Chef Gordon Ramsey, you can come out now.   I've always liked the idea of sushi plates rotating on a conveyor belt allowing you to pick and choose but when the sushi on the belt looks older than Betty White and smells as bad as vomit, it's the first sign to run. However, with a starving party of 14, I was overuled on leaving, so we stayed.  Not want to risk getting bubbleguts or worse food poisoning especially while on vacation, I sat back and watched the made for reality episode unfold.   8:00pm: Our large party is seated 8:15pm: Drink + kitchen orders are placed 8:20pm: The sounds of glass shattering and plates hitting the floor get the entire restaurants attention, one of the waiters has dropped a full tray of plates and dishes. 8:40pm: 25 min after placing drink + kitchen order, waiter heads our direction walking over the \" wet floor area \" I see a bowl of miso soup and rice flying in the air. There goes an additional 25 min. of waiting some more. 8:50pm Sushi chef making baked mussels scrathes his scalp and continues preparing the food. I guess their secret sauce must include dandruff.  9:00pm The drinks + kitchen items are delivered but the teriyaki beef is missing. The server goes to check. 9:10pm: First the dandruff and now there's a fish bone found in the miso soup. Really? 9:20pm: Everyone at the table is miserable and complaining about the food.  9:25pm: 20 minutes later, we ask for an update about the Teriyaki beef. The waiter goes back to the kitchen again. 9:35pm: The server returns with a BS answer. The kitchen never recv'd the order because of recent issues with the wi-fi which caused a system glitch. It might have been believeable had it not been for the waiter who originally took the order overheard laughing that he forgot to place the order. 9:50pm: The kitchen order is delivered as soon as were about to leave, almost 2 hours later. I ask if the manager will comp the $6.00 dish and the server returns with the Manager says \" No, you get your food and you must pay for it. \"  9:51pm: I'm still contemplating who to Hadouken (refer to Street Fighter )  9:52pm: What a waste of life, we pay the bill and leave.   Anything that could have possibly gone wrong, went wrong. One of the worst dining experiences ever. Disgusting sushi, a unsanitary chef and horrendous service, Teharu Sushi is only worthy of 1 star. This place is a joke.",

The prices were much more reasonable that the aforementioned place.   We will definitely go back when we want rotating sushi.   I only wish that they had at least one or two oriental sushi chefs. Nothing against hispanic sushi chefs, but it's always a plus on the ambience and experience if there is an asian sushi chef. It was a friday night, so I'm guessing they don't have any.   I wish the wait staff was a bit more attentive - Our waitress had the habit of not refilling our teas unless our cups were bone-dry. Also, I wish they would keep tally for each of their tables by taking away the pile of plates every now and then. The tower of plates resulted in my spilling my drink.",

The server (one of two) brought the plates and I asked her if I could have 2 more small ones without wasabi. She stated that some of the ones she brought had no wasabi on them. I said I know but still needed 2 more. Her reponse?? \"What do you need them for?\" UM really..? I just do. She leaves, returns with my plates and waters. OK so at this point I'm better, but then there's absolutely nothing on the conveyor that my kids will eat so I order 2 crab rolls.. took forever.. OK whatever. My husband and I get a Vegas roll off the conveyor. Frozen. Understandable since it's been going in circles for God knows how long. So we decide to put an order in so it's made fresh. Not so much. They pass it over the conveyor from the bar and still cold. I ask for them to make fresh hot ones because if I wanted them cold I'd get it off the belt. Get eyes rolling. Ordered baked scallop roll. Cold. I mean seriously! So needless to say cancelled everything else I ordered and left. Like I said I LOVE this place normally, but not so much today. Which is a shame since I moved about 40 mins away and decided to come here since we were in tempe.. very disappointing",

    "text": "I love the concept! This place is great for groups because you can try a lot of new things, and if you don't like it, someone else in the group will. Going with a group also reduces your bill, so it comes out to $7-10 per person. I think the quality of the sushi is lacking, but I don't think anyone expects beautiful, decorated rolls when the chefs are producing dozens of rolls in minutes. The fun of selecting sushi off a conveyer belt, and the practicality of doing this with a group are what keep bringing me back. The rolls themselves aren't the best though.",

Teharu is always busy so I dropped that fear as soon as I walked in the door! This place rocks my socks off! The restaurant is small, so get there early or go on a weekend for lunch if you don't want to wait for a table... however, my motto: if there is a line or a wait, it must be good!... and it was!  Our waiter was very friendly and so were all the sushi chefs. My hubby asked for a specific roll and they made it for him on the spot! The sushi is all really fresh and they make a bunch of different rolls and other things as well. It was a fun time and I can't wait to go back! My hubby and I had a tall stack of plates (I think we tried almost everything... prolly not but it seemed like it) and the whole bill was under $20!!!!",

    "text": "My mom brought me here for lunch after DD's swim lesson.  The place was jam packed with people waiting to be seated near the sushi belt.  We asked the host how long the wait would be and he generously offered to open up a table for us, if we would let him retrieve our sushi for us instead.  So, we bit.  What was a little annoying was that there were at least five parties ahead of us who could have filled the other tables, but they were made to wait.  A better solution was obvious, to us (at least).  Why not open up the second belt?  We suggested this to the host/waiter, but he said they only open up the second belt at dinnertime.  I understand what your normal operation is, but when you have a full restaurant...   Anyway, two tables were sat after we got our food and three or more of the original parties were still there when we left.  Would I wait that long to sit near a belt?  No way.  The good part about Teharu is that it is decent quality sushi (nothing special) for SUPER CHEAP.  Four adults and 1 child got away with a $38 bill, including one large beer ($4) two soft drinks and a juice.  Also, that included shrimp tempura and a bowl of rice for the little one.    The bad part is that the shrimp tempura was not completely cooked (the batter was still somewhat undercooked on a couple pieces).    Also, the music was quite loud.  It wasn't really my style.  As an aside... They were playing a Pandora station with commercials and all... I don't think Pandora would be too happy about that, either!  I think you have to have a commercial license for that!  It appears to be a clean place, so eat here with confidence.  Overall, I would eat here again if it pleased my mother.  Still, I wouldn't head to this place on my own.  I favor Mido Sushi (just a few blocks away) for many reasons.",

    "text": "BEWARE OF THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!  I am absolutely FURIOUS!  After receiving TERRIBLE service (on a Friday night, nonetheless), which included my server not bringing items that I ordered when the conveyor belt was empty, my friend and I both decided not to tip him because of his terrible service and attitude in response to our requests. Today, my friend checked her online statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharged $2. I go online to check my statement to find that I had also been overcharged $2. Checking with the 3 other friends who ate with us and decided to tip the server, we were the only 2 who were charged an extra $2 on top of our bill. Furious, I called Teharu, was told that the manager was unavailable and proceeded to begin explaining my situation and was asked if I left a tip. I explained that I hadn't because I had received terrible service. In my opinion, by not leaving a tip I am helping my server to realize that he did a terrible job and he will therefore reevaluate his service and perhaps improve upon it. Being that many people comment on their subpar service that they receive here, the servers must not be tipped very well. Is this the way that Teharu responds? By overcharging customers illegally? When I sign a Merchant's receipt, I am agreeing to pay the amount that I write...NOT any more than that. It's no wonder that their service does not improve...Teharu is illegally making customers tip their servers (I bet we are not the only ones that this has happened to) which causes the servers in turn to have no incentive to improve their customer service. What upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is \"no proof\" that I had been overcharged unless I bring in my receipt and bank statement, in which case they would refund $2 to my account. Obviously, it's only $2 so I'm not going to go all the way there just to get it back...I'll probably spend more on gas doing that. What infuriates me however is that when I explained that what Teharu did was ILLEGAL and FRAUDULENT, the woman on the phone was absolutely unfazed and did not seem to care about her business' immoral practices. Furthermore, my friend is a very light eater and $2 was nearly 33.3% of her bill. Imagine that - terrible service and a 33.3% tip? This business is absolutely terrible...I refuse to support a business that cheats customers out of their money by means of illegal and fraudulent practices.  UPDATE: My friend spoke to the manager, who was apparently on break when I called earlier, and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and considered intervening (but didn't). The manager continued to claim that this was a \"mistake\" and that it happens \"often\". My friend said that he seemed concerned and wanted to help us by offering to refund us $2. However, we do not care about the money, but rather that this does not affect other people. Therefore, our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharged, but rather that this business is not taking the necessary actions to ensure that their customers are satisfied and treated with honesty and respect. Being that the manager recognized that this is a problem that arises often, I do not understand why they are not taking this issue more seriously and investigating the source of this problem...if it happens so often, how is it an accident?! We expressed that we do not think that this is an accident in any way and that we will be contacting the police to investigate Teharu's fraudulent business activities. Furthermore, I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.  If you have eaten at Teharu and paid via credit card, I highly suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharged. If you were overcharged, I hope that you will either comment on this post, submit a complaint to the BBB, or call the police directly as I will be contacting them shortly. I do not feel that anyone should sit by and allow a business to conduct themselves in this manner - it is not only wrong, but ILLEGAL and I am determined to put an end to Teharu's fraudulent practices.",

We received the tuna and salmon nigiri since they were raw but we had waited 20 or 30 minutes for the salmon skin rolls. We heard a ding from one of the toaster ovens and thought it was our food but no rolls came to our table for another 5 minutes.  None of the chefs checked that oven to see what was inside.  We asked the waiter,  who never checked on the table that was just sitting there waiting,  and she had asked the chefs if they had any of the rolls started.  They said no and said they lost our ticket. We just got the check but on the way out,  I finally saw that the chef had taken out the stuff in that oven and started making the rolls. We waited so long for nothing and the food was pretty much already done.  It just took one of the three chefs to check on that oven. An apology would've been nice too since we wasted our time waiting.   None of the waiters offered to help us and we had to flag them towards our table all the time. We have been there quite a few times,  but it seems to have worsened over the years.",

    "text": "Teharu Sushi is a neat change of pace from your standard sit down restaurant or standard sushi bar.  This place can get crowded so be prepared to wait a little bit depending on when you show up - simply add your name to the wait list if their isn't a hostess right at the door.    Teharu operates a conveyor belt where small plates full of sushi, sushi rolls, and other miscellaneous items (pudding cup anyone?) pass in front of you for your choosing.  With a conveyor belt you might be expecting top notch sushi but I would simply describe the fare as \"decent\". The prices are quite good though as you can get your fill of Sushi for $10-20.    The selection of rolls and sushi is alright - you will see a lot of the standards, nothing too exciting though.  Some of the rolls seem a little strange to me such as the ones with potato shavings, onion shavings, and the phillie roll with cream cheese and red meat...for American palates I guess.  Ultimately, you can probably find better sushi in the valley but you will also probably spend more money and won't get the fun conveyor belt experience.    Check it out at least once for yourself.",
