    "text": "Came at prime time on Friday night. Was a bit of a wait, but not excessive. The king crab appetizer was enough to serve as an entree. It came with microgreens and summer squash, and was worth the $19 price tag. We also had a side of steamed tricolor cauliflower with ponzu sauce-worth the 3 bucks, but so much more could have been done with this. The roasted corn and poblano soup was outstanding.  Try the fruit pie and gelato for dessert.  I will probably try short ribs next time I come.  Jody, our server was top notch. \"Howie Burger\" with the gruyere cheese and caramelized onions was good combination per friend's report.  Aside from the burger, all the items we ordered were from the small featured menu, which generally features local seasonal ingredients.  It's noisy inside, so pick somewhere else if you want an intimate romantic dinner.  There is a back patio if outside dining is a realistic option.",

    "text": "One of my coworkers has mentioned Chelsea's more than once and after a morning of walking dogs at AAWL, I shot up 40th street to try Chelsea's. The interior is contemporary and open, the bar seating is interior but open to the patio.  The patio has several tables and umbrellas but I can see how it can fill quick.  I arrived at around 1140, they were still serving brunch (which I believe is served till 2 on both saturday and sundays).  Not really feeling what I saw on the brunch menu, I asked for a lunch/full menu.   I ordered a  white sangria which was refreshing and served with crisp apple slices and juicy sections of orange.  I finally decided on the Howie Burger cooked medium.  It is served with a nice gruyere cheese carmelized onions and a dijon sauce.   I was expecting the onions to be more simple and not marinated with a balsamic vinegar and I found the dijon sauce excessive and rather sweet.  I can't complain too much the burger patty itself was cooked perfectly medium as ordered.  All said and done I wish I had ordered the regular burger.",

The servers are great and the valet takes good care of you.  Notice the almost always there Bentley in the front of the restaurant! I am guessing this is the owners. A little pricey but great food, people and atmosphere!  I go about once a month. I would definetly go and check it out!",

The fish was cooked perfectly and the handmade tortillas were to die for (I just wish there were 1 or 2 more). I was lucky enough to also try the Howie burger which was also very tasty and cooked to perfection (oddly enough it was a bit sweet, which I thought I would never say about a burger). The only down sides to our meal were the wait and service. I would definitely recommend reservations on the weekend. Our waitress was absolutely terrible, probably the worst service I have had in quite some time, so the rating is primarily on the food. The atmosphere is also really nice and I would definitely plan to bring out of town guests or go on a date with the husband soon.",

The veg nut burger was absolutely delightful, light but still filling. The cole slaw salad it was served with was also quite flavorful. The meat-eating bf thoroughly enjoyed the porkchops, which appeared tender and juicy. The food was amazing, the customer service was great, and the prices were modest. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice, the decor an lighting set a great atmosphere for a casual, yet classy dining experience. A definite must-try!",

Yes of course you would, because that combination is delicious and awesome. But not at Chelsea's kitchen - you now get a smaller portion of huevos rancheros with a side of... wait for it.... strawberries. SERIOUSLY??? NOT DELICIOUS! When we asked the server about the substitution she informed us the beans and rice have strictly been forebode from the menu. GROSS - how can you honestly serve huevos rancheros and tell me there is not one single bean or grain of rice in your kitchen?? We used to come here at least once a month for brunch, but we won't come back until the beans and rice have returned and we can enjoy huevos rancheros as it should be. Chelsea's kitchen - getting rid of this delicious side was an egregious mistake. Fix it.",

    "text": "For dinner, my friend JB wanted something reasonably healthy and wasn't overly anxious about the price, as long as it was casual and allowed for conversation. She also mentioned recent cravings for rare-cooked tuna. Remembering the tasty tuna tartar appetizer I once had there and the tuna burger I'd seen on their menu, I took us to Chelsea's Kitchen (CK).  Chelsea's Kitchen is one of Craig and Kris DeMarco and Bob Lynn's several brainchildren that make up the LGO Hospitality family, which includes Arcadia's trendy places to be seen, Le Grande Orange Grocery, Le Grande Orange Pizzeria, Postino Cafe, and Radio Milano (one of two branches, the second being in Pomona, California). I'm definitely not a scenester, and CK tends to cater to the slightly older, not-so-trendy-but-still-in-the-know crowd who wants a good meal and a low-key atmosphere.  My work group goes there regularly for lunch, and I've liked every meal I've had there. I'll put a warning in about the Howie Burger--after awhile, the bottom bun gets soggy. The regular burgers hold up much better. The restaurant's lightly honeyed cottage cheese side is a nice alternative to fries.   Their menu is straightforward and to the point--no frills, no garnishes. The interior is the same. Hardwood tabletops, a few giant, yet minimalist stone pots for fake floral arrangements. Seats to lounge in. Nothing soft and flowing, but comfortable all the same. A band of windows, shaded by the roof's overhang, enwraps the dining room, bringing in comfy ambient light. That night, the comfy lighting was dim, but not so dim that you'd need a flashlight to read the menu and get a good look at your plate. Everything's clean, right down to the design lines. Even the busy open-view kitchen's stainless steel gives off a well-scrubbed look.  The hostess greeted us with a smile. I saw folks on the front patio and suggested we sit outside, too, remembering how loud the dining room's music can get and how close the quarters are. They sat us at the rear patio, along the canal, which I think was nicer than the front would've been. A very short time later, our waitress arrived to take our drink order, and we both ordered lemonade.  The service the whole night was quick and attentive, which was nice as most of the tables inside and out were seated. The servers weren't obtrusive while we had our animated conversation over our meal. We weren't waiting long before our lemonades and glasses of water arrived. The lemonade was cold and fresh, though after a few sips through a straw, some of the pithy stuff at the bottom started sending a face-puckering, bitter wash over my tongue. Unfortunately, there was no sweetener at the table, so I took only occasional sips. At the least, it was refreshing. And while I didn't love it, but they were quick and liberal with both lemonade and water refills at my table, topping us off whenever we got close to half empty.  Looking over the menu, the first thing I pointed out was the tuna tartar with guacamole and tortilla chips, and we decided to split the appetizer. The tortilla chips served with our appetizer chips were pale, fresh, crispy, and salty--all the components of a very addictive food. The only petty complaint was the one single chip that was just a bit chewy. The tuna tartar and avocado accompaniment was nicely done. It was simply seasoned, which is essential for letting the buttery tuna shine through. Avocado and tuna are a classic combination for a reason--they work well together, with the avocado buffering the fish (not fishy) taste, and the tuna polishing the avocado's taste. The crisp, thin chips gave a nice, brief crunch without overwhelming the tuna's and avocado's texture. Unfortunately, the speedy service worked against us, and it was just a few minutes between arrivals of appetizer and entree.  Sometimes, the skinny seasoned fries are limp, but the seasoning is consistently tasty. The tuna burger was beautiful, served with the top bun and all the accompanying fresh veggies to the side--lettuce, thinly sliced tomatoes, fans of avocado slices. I put the two together, sliced it in half, and had to give it the smackdown to make sure I could wrap my maw around it. The burger was perfect--moist, flavorful, scrumptious, and rare. The bun was fresh and soft. The glaze was awesome--slightly sweet and tangy, and the burger's edges were crisped, offering a nice contrast to the soft middle.  I wanted a place to tuck away and have good food. The open dining room where you can see the face of every other diner doesn't allow that, but there are plenty of patio niches that make close conversation easy, making the restaurant good for groups, despite the tight spaces between tables you sometimes have to navigate, but even better for a few friends if you sit outside. You probably won't find yourself daydreaming about the fare, but it's good and consistent enough to choose in a pinch when you don't want to blow a load of dough on a really good tuna burger.",

I have never had a problem with service on the restaurant side, only at the bar and patio.  I took a first date there on Sunday evening.  We arrived at 5 pm and were just going to get some cocktails and maybe an appetizer.  We sat in the bar area inside. Not at the bar, but at the pub tables.  We were talking, enjoying our conversation and about 10 minutes into our visit, we still hadn't been approached by anyone with a greeting or menus.  We kept talking but now I was trying get the attention of the server.  There were only 2 other people at the bar.  They weren't busy.  Being a first date, I didn't want to make a scene, so I suggested we go somewhere else.  I was still trying to get the attention of the server and/or bartender.  We kept enjoying our conversation and finally, after 33 minutes (I am not kidding) without so much as a \"hello\", we left and headed for Hillstones.  I was so embarrassed as Chelsea's was my suggestion.  I WILL NOT be giving Chelsea's my business anymore.",

The woodfired grill gives the lean meat great flavor, and the handcut fries are fresh and delicious. Try them in ranch dressing. This place is real trendy and always crowded.

We had a party of 5 people, one being my 8 year old daughter.  I ordered a steak, a cocktail and dessert at the end.  A few things didn't go well, including somehow they did not even put in my daughters meal order and we had to ask where her food was 3 times before we found out.  She was upset because we were all just about done eating when they finally brought her food out. We had asked to have a manager come over a few times before what looked to be a young kid came by and never once said he was management or even address the problems we were having at our table.  My steak was also not cooked the way I asked so it had to be sent back which I hate doing but it was Mother's Day dinner and I should be able to eat the steak the way I ordered it especially at their prices.  After much miscommunication between the waitress and one of the managers who looked like a young kid, the head manager, Chris finally came to our table to talk to us about the terrible Mother's Day dinner experience we had.  He was extremely nice and did what a good manager should do for good customer service.  We will go back due to Chris making us feel like we actually mattered and not just another customer they didn't care if we come back or not.  We are grateful that Chris went above and beyond our expectations and that is the only reason we will be going back to see if they can redeem themselves with better service.",

We got there in about 15 minutes and it was packed. The place was lively and had a great buzz. We gave our name and also waited by the bar in case 2 seats became available, which they did. We got served right away by very friendly girls behind the bar.  Half the bar is inside and half outside. They had heaters on the outside part as well as tables and a fireplace. It wasnt too cold since as it turned out, that is where the seats we got were. Now for the food, I ordered the vegetarian tacos, which were so good, The vegetables were not your basic veggies, they gave me carrots, spaghetti squash, ear tree mushrooms, bok choy and parsnip. The tortillas were 3 inches in size so that helped with keeping the calories down. They were delicious. Served with kale salad and quinoa/bean mixture. My husband had the short rib tacos, the meat was so tender and flavorful. He had the same sides as I did. We passed on dessert only because we had eaten gelato at The Gelato Spot in Old Town Scottsdale, which by the way was amazing. However, Chelsea's desserts looked yummy. Next time perhaps,,,,definitely recommend this place.",

Sat at the end of the bar and ended up overhearing  the servers complain to each other rather loudly throughout my whole meal.   Apparently the owner is narcissistic as they mentioned it at least 10 times. Who cares.  Perhaps my experience would have been better away from the chatty negative staff, but the food for me was subpar and the whole place felt kind of chain like.   Did like the patio tho, maybe next time.",

Service is well coordinated and someone is always around to help with whatever you may need.  On our last visit we enjoyed the green chili soup and the locally sourced grilled vegetables.  Chelsea's does a great job of using local sources and highlighting them on the menu.  Also well priced entrees for brunch.  Located right on the canal so very nice please to walk or bike to as well.  Highlight local breweries as well.  Good for families as well especially on the large patio area!  Give them a try!",

Great for dates or a small brunch gathering. The only criticism I would give is that I got the eggs Benedict and my egg was cooked thoroughly all the way. It's a shame that the egg wasn't poached correctly, but the dish itself still tasted good and was a filling portion.  I would highly recommend getting the white sangria, it's delicious!",

No greeting, no smile. \"What do you want ladies\"? Drinks took another 15 minutes to get. Had to flag her down 20 min later to take our food order. Our food was put down on the table and our waitress never said a word, just walked away. Food was delish!!! But the crappy service took the pleasure out of eating. Felt very unwelcome!!!!!",

It had been approximately a year since I had been to Chelsea's Kitchen. I hate to say it, but my experience was badddd: *Server was not welcoming, actually quite rude. Did not welcome us - just went straight into \"what would you like to drink.\" We asked for a side of salsa - had to ask 3 times. Did not check on us throughout meal. It was bad. *Food: -expensive for what you get - $100 for 3 people. That was for 2 of the cheaper glasses of wines, 1 appetizer, 3 entrees. Maybe I wouldn't mind paying if it was worth the $100. -largely the SAME menu that you can get at either La Grande Orange or Ingos for a FRACTION of the price (I wish I could underline FRACTION). -Menu really hadn't changed in a years time!? I was excited to try something new here, and I didn't really have that option. -Chips and guacamole for the appetizer. Guacamole and salsa were tasty! Chips were way over salted, a bit greasy. Come on, they're just chips..... -I got the Ahi Tuna burger: came on a plain hamburger bun that I could have bought a Fry's. The Ahi was good. My side was French fries - the came out soggy, stuck together, and greasy. $15 wasted. -Sea salt chocolate chip cookies upon exit? Yep none - they were out. *Valet - awesome experience, those guys were working so hard.  Final thought: Thank goodness La Grande Orange and Ingo's are still affordable and amazing quality. I will be going back there, not Chelsea's Kitchen! Good luck.",

The chicken has some sort of rub that gives it s beef jerky taste, prob my favorite item. Also seems like a good spot for a business lunch or happy hour. Only negative is its a little pricey for what it is which is new american food. But considering the area and vibe its def worth checking out!",

    "text": "AMBIANCE: upon walking into this location from the chilly weather outside, I was pleasantly surprised. There were big lamps, a fireplace, and just an overall cozy, warm atmosphere and the place was packed! The patio was set up with string lights and gas heating posts. While waiting briefly for a table, it was amazing watching the kitchen crew hustle in such a small space and organize the rapid delivery of plates. I was happy to recognize the same expediter from Ingo's. No food sat in the window for very long and didn't leave without total quality control! We were sat within 15 minutes, which wasn't long considering we didn't have a reservation and it was Friday night and Christmas week. This place has a very chic, upscale vibe with many families and couples and it was abuzz with conversations, but not too loud.   FOOD: I was looking forward to the Dixie Pan Fried chicken, as fried chicken is my favorite comfort food. It came as 2 very moist and juicy chicken breasts with a crispy coating that was cooked perfectly, not too dark brown like at other places. They came on a generous portion of mashed potatoes and they went very well together. My only wish would be a jus or gravy to add to the mash, but this dish was amazing as is. I also very much enjoyed the daily vegetable of roasted heirloom carrots in what I tasted was ginger and honey. My dining companion had a burger with their homemade fries. It was very big and tasty using high quality beef like at Ingo's. I give high marks for restaurants that serve a middle size of wine between a glass and a bottle (10-12 oz. carafes). Everything was priced very reasonably for what you get.   SERVICE: our server (and all the other servers we watched go back and forth) was always moving quickly and efficiently to every table. There is a real energy to this place that has a lot to do with the people that work here. I was impressed when a manager checked in with us to chat about our experience. You can tell that she really loves what she does as do everyone else here.   I'm glad I found this restaurant as it will now become one of my favorites to frequent regularly.",

I strongly suggest sitting on the patio during your dining experience.  I've had a few things from their menu including a green chili burger, nachos and tacos. They recommend getting your burger done rare to medium rare but I am not one to eat my meat that pink and uncooked. The burger wasn't my favorite but the nachos and tacos are delicious.  Be careful what you order during happy hour. I feel it is slightly misleading in that you think that all wine is five dollars a glass when it is actually only certain glasses of wine. I ended up spending $17 on one glass. For that price, I could get a whole bottle at the store.  They have free salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door. Being gluten free I haven't been able to try them but I've heard they are delicious.",

While the place was busy, there was no wait and we were seated immediately.  Our server was quick and friendly and we had multiple folks helping us throughout the morning.  We had:    - 6 Deviled eggs with bacon - sooooooooo yummy!!!!! ($7) - Bottomless Mimosas ($12) - Arnold Palmer (can someone tell me where all of that foam comes from?) - ($3) - French Omelet (Gruyere cheese & spinach served w/spinach and English muffin... why not a croissant?) - ($12) - Lobster sliders with green beans ($16) - Side of sauteed spinach (no charge since they gave us green beans in error) - Red Velvet cake ($8)  Total = $63.39 with tax no tip  The food for the most part was good.  The French Omelet while touted to be a local favorite was just okay.  The Lobster sliders while small actually had more flavor.  I enjoyed the bottomless mimosas and appreciated that my glass was never empty.  We asked for the red velvet to go just because we were stuffed from everything else.  On the way out we grabbed a couple of the salted chocolate chip cookies as well and they were equally delicious.  I liked the vibe and decor of this place and the service was just fine.  If in the area again, I'll certainly like to come back to try some of their other menu items.",

    "text": "Such a good Saturday brunch spot. Our server, Kim, was the best - so nice and great conversation. We got the deviled eggs with bacon as an app, very very very good. I got a burger with the home-made fried, it was very tasty, better than I expected. The short rib tacos were amazing; I would only suggest adding a white shredded cheese, the home-made corn taco shells were such a nice touch and they tasted very fresh. The kitchen under-cooked a separate burger on the table, but they offered the fix it and they were concerned about the mistake (he ordered it well-done and it came out medium; I don't see this as a mistake as a burger should never be cooked well).  We got the unlimited mimosas - very quick to refill.   The manager is very observant and walked around throughout our time in the resturant checking on tables - I liked this, it's nice to see people care.   DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE RED VELVET CAKE!!!!!",

If I had only been to Chelsea's once and ate the short rib tacos, I'd probably be giving this place 4 or 5 stars. But since I've been there several times (at the request of visitors and friends) and have tried several items on the menu, I would have to say Chelsea's is your typical American new style restaurant. It's just OK. I will say though that if you do go, the Short Rib Tacos and the White Sangria are the things to get. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend other items as they do not stand out. Also as a random comment, they have some neat bathrooms.",

I might have given it 4 stars because the wait was a little long, but what can you expect with food this delicious. Once we sat down it took no time at all and our food was there. It was by far one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the one with harvati cheese, sauted onions and lettuce. My friend got the ahi tuna burger and raved about how good it was. Both burgers came with fries which were amazingly seasoned and we got an order of the market carrots with a pesto sauce, cheese etc- really great. I would go back in a heartbeat.",

We went with first available so we didn't get to sit outside on the patio but what a nice space. No wonder it was crowded! While we waited which was only like 45 minutes I had a drink called Mind The Gap. It was so good I asked them for the recipe on Twitter so I could make it myself. It's a mix of cucumber vodka and cardamom and Serrano simple syrup. It's delightful.  For dinner we started with the devil eggs which were so good. The smaller size comes with three which was perfect. We also shared a pitcher of white sangria which is an absolute must. The come mix it at the table and pour it into everyone's glass and add fruit to your glass too so it doesn't spill everywhere. One of my friends and I both got burgers which were so good. I had the green chili one with a lettuce wrap. It was really flavorful. It's served with fresh cut fries which were really good. I'm a lover of French fries!   The service was also really really good which can make a good restaurant really over the top. Not to mention the free chocolate chip cookies you can grab on your way out.   Cannot wait to go back!!",

My go-tos are:  - chicken nachos for the table to share  - burgers w/ the grilled poblano - fish or steak tacos - chilaquiles - Brussel sprout salad - keylime pie - sangria, mimosas & bloody Mary's  Other pluses- they have patio seating when the weather is mild.    Negatives include: limited parking but they have valet. Also It's loud so it's better for groups.",

The salad tasted very fresh. The tacos were so flavorful and what really spoke to me was how tender the meat is here. The butter pecan gelato was so delicious I asked for two scoops! Yum!

First they offered a special M-day menu but when I ordered off it they no longer had any left so I was left with ordering tacos. The meat was overcooked and the lobster was chewy. The posole barely had any meat or hominy, so we were left with improperly strained red thick soup with tortilla strips. Then we got excited for dessert. We ordered the imfamous red velvet and some coffee. Five minutes later they come back and say they are out. Seriously, how do you not make sure to keep enough in stock on such a busy day. They still brought the coffee which we no longer wanted as it was supposed to pair with the dessert. Now I will give them this, they did attempt to make it better. They found a slice of red velvet left at the sister market which they gave us free, plus a gift card to come back another day. Although they certainly tried to rectify the issue,  the night as a whole was disappointing. My husband does business in the area so he will probably stop to use the card, but you wont be dragging me there anytime soon.",

The food is consistently good, the service and atmosphere are top notch and it's in a great location, but I can't seem to give them five stars.  I have always gotten their tacos and most recently tried the seared ahi ones that our server said were only on the lunch menu but I could get for dinner. The ahi was perfectly done and tasted great but didn't really jive with the soft taco fixins. Still it was tasty and I ate and liked it. JD had a cheeseburger that he described as \"meh, not as good as Delux (his gold standard)\".   Maybe my only thing against  Chelsea's is that it has yet to serve me anything so special to make me YEARN to go back again. If someone suggests it for dinner I'm all in, but would I ever be the suggestee? Nope probably not. Perhaps I should try something new the next time I go and I just might fall for Chelsea's a little harder, but for now she's just an acquaintance that I don't talk bad about but neither do I praise.",

    "text": "Wish I'd happened upon joyce k's review, prior to trekking in here last night, cuz the $14 ahi burger jump started an oddly disappointing evening.  Very thin composite patty, neither grilled not seared pink inside, but griddled grey all the way through, like a Boca burger. The bun was maybe one grade above a commercial McDonald's bun. Soft and unsubstantial. Since this $14 entree excluded sides, I paid an additional $3 for \"root vegetables\", apparently Chelseas' code for 'colorless scoop of undercooked fried potato cubes'.    We'd eaten here a year or so prior and had a more than respectable meal with a charming young waiter, so were genuinely surprised at how cobbled together and prideless this dish appeared. Yet even I admired how our strategically inattentive waitress 'forgot' to ever swing by and inquire how little I was enjoying this star crossed (or was it Starkist?) patty.  She gets it...this restaurant biz.   A grand total of four beers on tap, starting at $7 a pint? You do realize, Chelseaphiles, the object of your rather pricy affectation abuts the backside of a gas station along the guanoed canal and a bug infested apartment eyesore looms across the street?  Yeah, sure. It's \"Arcadia\". Whatever you say.      As a weird and perhaps inappropriate aside, it took my actively searching wife and I most of the evening to spot a single 'person of color' in this sprawling, adequately lit establishment.  It was packed with a forty minute wait, so we're talking hundreds and hundreds of people.  I finally saw an older woman off in a corner who the missus confirmed vaguely looked Philipino. Sure, it's just one snapshot on a Thursday night, and I have nothing against PV Caucasians descending from hilltop palazzos for a \"comfortable\", burger, cookie and confab.  White folk gotta eat.  Heck, we're hungry, white and reside on a gentle knoll ourselves. But all the same, in a major city in 2011, it's probably fair to at least wonder if such a notable absence of color was entirely coincidental or, like some of the food and service, a product of less tasteful intentions.",

Highly recommend this one!  Why not 5 stars... more family orientated, less chic, but if that is fine with you, then assume a 5. Great for a date too by the way.",

The food was excellent and our only complaint is they brought our appetizer out with our main dishes...otherwise it would have been a 5 star experience.

    "text": "Well, it happened. Somewhere along the way, I turned 23. It happened without fanfare, or angels descending from the heavens with rare Tori Amos bootlegs. In fact, it passed quietly, with a certain stately dignity, marked only by the receipt of some not-so-modest gifts and some co-workers taking me (and a few other co-workers with October birthdays) to Chelsea's Kitchen for lunch. Oh, and my boyfriend baked me a cake. And decorated it. And is the most wonderful and amazing boyfriend, ever. But this isn't his review, so the lovebird shout-outs stop here. I promise.  Chelsea's Kitchen is just \"the cuteness.\" I know that, unlike my birthday, the phrase \"the cuteness\" is devoid of all dignity. I know this. But, the fact remains: Chelsea's Kitchen is \"the cuteness.\" The landscaping and decorative touches outside, (the little pond! the lovely patio), to the bright and rich interior...I pretty much knew I'd like it when we were walking up. Note: many reviews mention that it is a cutthroat parking situation during lunchtime. My work caravan arrived at around 12:15, and parking was easy. Maybe we were lucky. Maybe it's not actually that bad most of the time. I don't know!  Our waiter was friendly and courteous, and attentive without being overbearing. He kept the Arnold Palmers coming, which was much appreciated. Speaking of the Arnold Palmers, they were awesome. I know it's just lemonade and iced tea with a wrinkled little mint leaf floating on top, but, damn. I was hitting them, and I was hitting them hard. I might've just been in a cheery mood and feeling overly generous, but they were totally the tastiest Arnold Palmers I've ever had.   I eat red meat very sparingly, but the Green Chile Burger was too tempting to pass up. And, guess what. I ordered it...medium well! My mother instilled me with a fear of Ecoli so strong and persistent that I have never ordered a burger or any other cut of meat without making sure that it would be \"well done.\" This was a momentous occasion, but I kept my triumph to myself. Why share my crazy with my innocent co-workers? Gotta save this weird shit for Yelp.   The burger was delicious. I don't really even like burgers, and I thought it was super tasty. The fries are seasoned, crisp, and equally tasty. Paired with an Arnold Palmer from the gods, I was a happy little birthday clam. The desserts were tempting, but we were all stuffed and ready to head back to the daily grind. Even the kids menu looked pretty good. PBJ sushi? Cuteness! \"The cuteness,\" to be exact.  Pricey for lunch, but worth it, I think. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend.",

Tuna Tartare with guac appetizer: AWESOME. A bit hard to eat, but very good.   White sangria: PERFECT (x2) under the \"misters\" on a hot September evening. (105. I've never even SEEN misters, I like them. Like running through the sprinklers while you eat, but not so wet). Actually, no...I know exactly what it's like. Being a piece of produce at the grocery store...the only thing missing was the kitschy little \"I'm singing in the rain\" bit they play...For some reason, that always makes me smile.   i digress, but at least I am well watered.   Swordfish Tacos: The fish was excellent. Tortillas were a bit soggy, but only due to the massive amount of toppings. I also tried some of Jared's Steak Tacos. They were a little skimpy with the steak...boys need to eat! But, it was well prepared.   No room for dessert. Ok, that's a lite. We went to Gspot for gelato ;)   Really great spot, props to GK and JM for the tour!",

I ordered the short rib tacos which I would highly recommend. They came 'deconstructed' which I liked allowing me to put what I'd like on top. Served with pico, guacamole and a kale salad type of topping. Absolutely delicious homemade corn tortillas. My guests ordered the filet which was great and also the special pork tacos which she enjoyed. The only reason for not giving five stars is that we were constantly swatting flies off of our food the whole time we were there. Overall I would recommend and I'd definitely go again.",

The buns are not vegan, so I opted for the lettuce wrap suggested by our waiter. Several of my dinner companions had meals that came with house made tortillas. They were excellent and I used a couple to sandwich my burger.   The house made cashew cheeze spread was superb. Possibly the best I've had.   My side dish of green beans and greens was also delicious.   The service was top notch. Our waiter was friendly, and attentive. Food runners assisted in getting our meals to the table fresh and hot.   The atmosphere is somewhat noisy. I'm not sure the loud music was helpful.   I would go again to try the other almost vegan option: veggie tacos.",

The quantity was generous but the quality was substandard. For my main meal I got the fish of the day; pan seared halibut. It looked presentable however when I took the first bite I realized it just looked pretty and lacked True flavor. It was so bland. It was accompanied with beans and asparagus. That was the highlight of the night. I ordered a mint chip gelato for dessert and I am not kidding when I say this it literally tasted like mouthwash.

My guy got a burger- unfortunately he ordered a medium rare and it came out well done. The meat they used for the burger was so top notch that is still tasted great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area and will be back on my next visit to Phoenix!",

You can't go wrong with the Deviled eggs appetizer with bacon on top (needed for salt and crunch). I feel like if you are wanting something more than a regular salad they have lots of great options to make you feel like you aren't eating just another salad. Ceviche is decent, I enjoyed it but probably will order something different when I go back.   Dinner Entrees were decent but I'll probably stick to this place for brunches and lunches. Great place for bridal shower or bachelorette party. My husband didn't enjoy this place as much as I do.   Don't miss the salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out!",

I went to the restaurant at 4:30 and like an hour after we got there and got seated it started to fill up pretty quick. For a drink a got a Coca-Cola which was bottled and from Mexico which means that there is real sugar instead of fake sugar. Then I got fried chicken and mash potatoes which comes with a small savory roll and that dish was so good and I would definitely recommend that to anybody. The rest of my family said that there food was pretty good but my dad said that his salad was bland. When we all finished me and my family friend got pumpkin pie but our waitress was a complete SAVAGE because she knew that I wanted pumpkin pie because I tried to order it before she came back to actually get our order and when she came back she said that they were out of pumpkin pie which gave my face the oh crap look on my face but she said just kidding and I was relieved. I loved the pumpkin pie and my family friend said that she was not a fan and had better. The seenary was really cool because there was a lot of trees that had cool lights on them, I loved this place and I definitely recommend this to anyone",

The ambiance is awesome as well, with a really cool outdoor patio/open wall bar set up. For dinner I had a Caesar salad followed by a delicious rotisserie chicken. The potato side had kale mixed in and it was so buttery goodnessy I almost licked my plate. Vegetable of the day was broccoli with a spicy ragu which I thought sounded gross til I had it - also incredibly tasty. Seriously this was the best food I had on my trip to Phoenix! Make sure you grab a free cookie by the entrance. Nothing makes me smile like a salty cookie. This place is the bomb!",

The customer service definitely was lacking. Not a single smile nor any personalization of any kind. The ambiance pretty much says, \"eat quickly and get out.\"   The food is a quite pricey for what you get. $17 for a salad? That being said, the quinoa salad that i had was very delicious! Crispy and except for a few too many bell papers, definitely worth trying. While I live right down the street it would be tough for me to come here when there are other places to see.   While I'm here I am noticing that the management is on top of their customers, and wanting to make sure they are good. This is highly appreciated, and admired. They fact that they are out and helping wherever is needed is pretty unique.  I might have to come back and give this place another try, and hope to see better waitress service, and not eat as much so as to try their really good looking desserts.",

LGO Restaurant with many items from the LGO menu. The exception is there is nicer seating and more than the LGO down the road.  Tried the Short Rib Hash which was very good was served with onions and potatoes topped off with an egg on top served with a English Muffin. Also had the devil eggs which came out on a wooden plank.  Service was exceptional and always filled up our water and ice tea before the glass was below the middle of the glass.  Personally I prefer the ambience of the LGO Restaurant down the road but both restaurants are a can't go wrong.",

We wanted to go somewhere with a great patio where we could enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring weather, and also have a nice lunch.  We were not disappointed! The patio is perfect! It is surrounded by pretty trees and flowers. It has just the right amount of shade, you can enjoy the sunshine, but you don't feel like you are baking.   We had the taco platters. I had the Ahi and it was great. My friend had the swordfish which was also great. We enjoyed our yummy tacos with a couple of Prickly Pear Margaritas, which tasted as nice as they looked.  I will definitely make the drive to Phoenix to visit Chelsea's again.",

Within about 24 hours from my original post, I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing for our \"just okay\" visit.  She gave us a gift certificate to go back.  We took up the offer and returned for a full dining experience.   We were extremely impressed.  I have to say our waitress, Jessica, probably provided the best service I have ever received, at least the best I can remember in a very long time.  She was able to read us to know whether we were there for a quick dine or relaxed long dine.  I had a red wine that was delicious. We ordered the fish tacos and a hamburger.  Keep in mind, the price is more on the high end, but they delivered on taste and presentation. The food was brought at the right time.  I get nervous when the food at a place like this is delivered too quickly... I will definitely be returning as the food, service and ambiance is deserving of a 5 star review.",

    "text": "I visited Chelsea's Kitchen for brunch with a large group and have to agree with most other reviews-- this place is fantastic.  Nearly everything on the menu looked scrumptious and as a vegetarian I found that there were sufficient choices for the veggie inclined.   I toyed with the ideas of a spinach omelette with gruyere cheese and a veggie burger, but ultimately decided on Chelsea's Hotcakes.  I was absolutely delighted-- these are not your standard run-of-the-mill heavy, doughy, bland pancakes, people... these are special!  They're light and fluffy and infused with an orange essence.  Tiny bites of heaven.  Truly! They were served with a side of fruit seasoned with mint leaves.  I loved the refreshing mint-- although the fruit itself could have been slightly fresher-- the grapes had probably seen better days about a week ago!    The decor was tasteful and relaxed and the service was fantastic.  Our server was attentive and patient with such a large group, which isn't always the case. Although I didn't partake in any of their brunch cocktails, others I was with enjoyed the pomegranate margarita and white wine sangria immensely... perhaps a bit too much in fact!    As a nice touch, as you leave, instead of the same old overdone mint, we were offered a delicious chocolate chip cookie topped with sea salt.  The perfect salty-sweet combination.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back and sampling more of their tempting menu selections.",

It's a small menu, but there are a few things that look to be worth trying. This time I went with a French dip with fries. The sandwich was good - quality meat and bread with a nice flavored dip. The plate was piled high with fries - easily twice as much as there should have been. But they were very tasty - nicely seasoned, with a little sugar and maybe a hint of cinnamon.  For a nice place with all organic food, the prices were definitely reasonable.",

The waitstaff is always nice and helpful, and the food is always good, despite the fact that every time I go there I order the same thing (so that doesn't allow for much variation in my review).   Anyhow, what I usually get, the Ahi Tuna Tacos are ALWAYS great. The tuna is perfectly cooked, and melts in your mouth every time you get it. With the taco plate comes some of their shredded kale salad, which compared to other kale salads ive had, is the best, and somespicy aioli, tortillas and hot sauce. The aioli is the part that completes the whole meal!   Also, their chicken nachitos are the best nachos I've had at any place in Arizona that doesn't serve predominantly Mexican food. Very cheesy and crunchy, with a good assortment of other toppings. Sometimes, the chicken is scarce.   They also offer free sea salt chocolate chip cookies at the end of your meal which really do put a cherry on top of the whole experience! The perfect ratio between sea salt and cookie!   the two cons to Chelsea's  Parking: They only offer valet. Even though it's free, it's somewhat of a bother.  Drinks: If you order a soft drink, like Diet Coke, or whatever, they only give you one can, which you pour yourself, and if you finish before your meal is over, they don't give you a second one without you having to ask (and an extra price added to your bill).  Despite these two things, Chelsea's still deserves five stars.",

Service at the bar was lacking, but the drinks were pretty decent once we got them.   Started with a bloody mary, dad had a bloody maria--both served with pickled green bean in lieu of other garnish. Odd, bitter, inedible, but just the garnish. The drink itself was tasty and pretty well proportioned. It even had just the right amount of ice.   We ordered the chicken nachitos, which were plentiful and delicious. Everyone munched on these hardcore, and we still had some left over when our entrees came out!   My husband and I shared the Brussels sprout salad and neither of us found it appealing, which was a disappointment. We also shared the short ribs, however, and these were really to die for! The meat was fork tender, and the sauce was quite nice.  My father had the taco platter with steak, I believe, which I tried and found a little licorice-y. My mother had the cheeseburger, which was tasty but nothing special.",

Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly hostess who offered us a sampling of their salty chocolate chip cookies. Tempted, we told her we would try after lunch. The wait staff was very attentive and took our orders promptly. Drinks came out soon after ordering and we did not wait long for our lunches either-   white sangria: light and crisp, refreshing with the fresh fruit Arnold Palmer: the perfect balance of lemonade and ice tea. On a hot Phoenix day it's perfect! Short rib tacos: a must! The short ribs are tender and not fatty! Plus the tortillas are warm and just the right consistency to stand up to this meaty taco filling!  Seared ahi tuna- good if you are looking for something light.  And for dessert: red velvet cake! This slice with cream cheese frosting was mouth-watering! There is a misproportion of cream cheese to Cake, and the cake is slightly densier than we prefer, but it was flavorful and addicting the more you ate. The under study on this plate, but deserves recognition is the buttercream gelato! Yum-o!!!   At the end of our meal, our bellies were full and satisfied. I would definitely recommend this place to others, although warning: it is on the pricier side as other yelpers have mentioned!   Lastly, before leaving the hostess remembered I wanted to try the cookies. She came to the door and opened the jar before I left! How sweet!!!! (cookie was alright not my favorite)",

    "text": "First time here. Took my BFF for her birthday at the recommendation of a few friends. And I informed our waiter of that.  When you get there no choice but valet b/c they take up the bulk of the pkg spots. It's free but don't forget to tip!  We got a table inside right away.  Our waiter was tied up so another server came & took our drink order. We both ordered ice tea. I asked if it came sweetened or unsweetened. She said unsweetened. Got the ice tea & not happy w/ taste b/c she neglected to tell us it was Passionfruit (& sweet) flavored. Think that is important to let the customer know. Sent it back. And asked for a Sprite. So it took a while to get that & was surprised to get a CAN of Sprite? So for the cost of a can (outrageous) it took that long to get one?!  We ordered an appetizer & then our meals. Our waiter checked on us & said the appetizer would be out in a few minutes. Imagine our surprise when our entrees came out and no appetizer. The girl who delivered them had no clue. Our waiter came over & apologized that it happened. The mgr brought the appetizer & they both informed us it would be comped.  Then since it was the BFF's bday we ordered a dessert to share. Imagine our surprise when the dessert was delivered by someone else with a lit candle saying Happy Birthday!!! And it was the wrong dessert.... So we politely said thank you & blew out the candle and set it aside. Waiter came over a few minutes later and immediately saw it was wrong one, apologized profusely, took it away & brought back the right one. He also comped that as well. So service-wise it was ok. And they really did their best to make up for it. I attributed it to it being a beautiful Sunday brunch rush. And that is why I only gave 4 stars.   Now that was the service.... The food was another story..... 5 stars for sure!!! Deviled eggs w/ bacon/truffle - ahhhhmazing! Prime rib - perfect! The veggie was asparagus & I abhor asparagus so the chef made me some fabulous sauteed spinach & I adore spinach. BFF ordered the short rib tacos - mouth watering! Guacamole was fabulous! So we totally picked off each other's plate. The red velvet cake was yummy & vanilla bean gelato even yummier!!  We decided even with the lapses in service, our waiter was great, he made up for the lapses, food was fabulous, we would go back & also recommend it to others. Everyone can have an \"off\" day and if we go back and get a repeat in the service area.... then we will reconsider coming back or recommending to others.",

The best eggs bennie too (with homemage english muffins)... but after tasting huevos rancheros, it's hard to bother with anything else.  The prices aren't  exactly budget friendly - but worth the occasional splurge.   Word to the wise: Mimosa's are bottomless only on Saturday - we mixed the days once and ended up spending 40 bucks on breakfast booze while the food was 20 :/",

The restaurant has a laid back, comfortable vibe to it...definitely a place you feel relaxed and can enjoy your meal.  The service was fantastic and the food was amazing.  I enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich with the fresh vegetables on the side...the swiss chard and cauliflower with a lemon zest were absolutely perfect.  My friend enjoyed the tuna tartare and a small side kale salad - she was very pleased with her meal as well.  This is definitely a restaurant to add to the regular rotation!",

    "text": "First time i had been here over the weekend.  Took a business guest for dinner because i had several friends tell me about how good it was.  Must have been a bad night because there were several mess-ups.  Just a note to the restaurant on these things:  I ordered lemonade to drink.   This was the oddest tasting lemonade I have ever tasted.  I asked for something different and said it had an odd taste and I asked what was in it.  Server said fresh lemons and then egg whites.  EGG WHITES?  Why are egg whites in my lemonade?  What if someone had an egg allergy?  You wouldn't really expect egg in your lemonade???  Anyhow, i would stear clear of this concoction.  Ordered guacamole and chips.  That was slow coming and then the waitress comes out and turns out it was delivered to the wrong table near us and those people had been waiting to tell someone that it wasn't theirs.  So we finally got that order.  Upon eating it, got a big hard chunk in my mouth which was the 'stem' of an avocado..  Later, as we we waiting for our main course of filets, yet another server tried to give us food that was for someone else's table.  Is there a problem with this??  When the steaks arrived I will say they were the better part of the meal.  Cooked well and tender.  Luckily something came out good because next..  Was the dessert.  I ordered the chocolate flourless cake and it was fairly bland to me.  Maybe after eating the hearty steak my taste buds were off but i really didn't like this at all.  It was extremely heavy.  I only had a few bites.  Since i didn't really like that dessert i noticed that they had a big stack of chocolate chip cookies by the door.  They looked great.  However - they are NOT GREAT!!  Horribly salty and now i was leaving without anything to drink!!  Well, i guess someone likes this place because i know they are always busy but i don't think it was of my taste and i was embarrassed that i took my business guest here.",

It was restaurant week so maybe that was the downfall of service. The Roasted Prime Rib was awesome!  UPDATE: I was contacted a few short hours after my review and they are truly committed to service! Based on the offer they have extended to my wife and I, we will be back. 2nd review to come........  Ok, went and used the very generous offer from Chelsea's. Service was much more improved. Food was still really good. Food was never the issue, it was service. Great friendly, fast, no issues. Must have just been a fluke the last time. Will be back! Thanks Chelsea's for making this what it should have been....a great dinner to start the night!",

I had the Buck & Rider cocktail which was perfect for any whiskey lover. After only about 25 minutes, we were shown to our table. I love the decor and the openness of the restaurant. Next time I definitely want to try and get a table outside. For my main, I ordered the daily fish special. It was cooked perfectly and paired with slight sweet sauted vegetables. My friend ordered the filet. I tried a bite and it was also perfectly prepared paired with mashed potatoes and green beans. I can't wait to come back!",

I get the feeling that I didnt get to witness this place when it is in its prime, but what I experienced was good, very good.   I never really left the patio, because the ambiance out there was amazing and induced mingle - which was the purpose of my evening. The option to sit down and have a more personal conversation was always there, but never used. Instead I browsed through the crowd silently, staying out of the conversations unless I was called out on being the smirking observer.   The service was not super attentive, but very friendly and knowledgable. I felt very at home at this place, and never that I had to become indescreet to obtain service. I also had some awesome porter, which name was forgotten by the first sip.   The sortiment of beers and drinks is way sufficient. I will be coming back here, it is just in a part of town I dont frequent all that often. Kinda sad, I wish I did.   Chitty chitty .. der kritiker",

The price fixe made it a good deal, otherwise I would have probably stuck with just the ribs.  Awesome service on the patio, much quieter than inside, and our waitress was perfectly attentive.

It was real good, very light, but that was fine because I had the nachos as an appetizer..the best nachos! We finished it. Then my sister had the sea bass, she gave it a 3/5, yummy bread crumbs! And then my boyfriend had a chili burger which he said was his top 5. They have really yummy fries! Oh and you need to order their flourless chocolate cake. This restaurant was so packed but we only waited for about 20 mins, while waiting we just hungout at the bar and had beer. I was def satisfied compared to sundays brunch!",

And the food is great and reliable -- the tuna tartare with guac is a good sized portion (if a bit underseasoned) with what seem like housemade tortilla chips. The Howie burger is nice, fat, well seasoned and well prepared version, the short ribs are deliciously tender and enhanced by the optional egg, and the free salted chocolate chip cookies hit the spot. The veggie burger is a bit crumbly, but it's a minor quibble, and the flavor (I believe it's a bean base) is appealing. The service is also noticeably pleasant, helpful and accommodating. Just a great place for a relaxed dinner any night of the week.",

    "text": "Yesterday I visited with my friends for my second time at Chelsea's kitchen. It was our first double date and we all agreed on how good our previous experiences at Chelsea's kitchen had been.  We were seated in less than 20 minutes as first available to a table outside, but when we realized how chilly it was, decided to ask for an inside table and wait at the bar longer. We had a couple drinks at the bar, the old fashioned was good but some drink with China China in a martini glass was not so good. We were finally seated at a booth inside and although the lighting was very poor in our area, we were glad to be seated. Waters were brought to us but then it took more than 10 minutes to get a waitress to come greet us and be a part of our table. It felt as if our waitress was not so happy to be working or was more in tuned in technology than looking at us and acknowledging us. Even when she talked her head was down at the tablet and it just didn't feel as friendly as a waitress would be or atleast portray to be. The food was really good, steak on the surf and turf tacos was more medium rare than medium well like asked but nevertheless had good flavor. I love the short rib tacos at Chelsea's kitchen and one of the reasons me and my boyfriend continue to eat there periodically. But I felt as if it wasn't one of our best service experiences and waitress could've been more involved considering a 86$ tab for two people dinner.   Recommend short rib tacos anytime, they haven't disappointed ever!",

We ordered a Sunday Brunch special item  which was a baked  mixture of shredded pork Mexican spices seasoning(forgot the name of the dish) with black beans, guac, sweet potatoes and a baked egg which was all perfect. The other dish was hot cakes. It was very simple but tasty it had a hint of lemon so it was a nice tart change from a traditional pancake. Very thin not too heavy and I think the serving was 4 or 5 hot cakes.  The service from beginning to end was great. The host was very energetic friendly and prompt. Our server truly made our day. We had mimosas flowing not thinking to ask/confirm if they had bottomless on Sunday's. We didn't ask till the last round which was probably the 3rd or 4th at the most. Not complaining at all but just asking/confirming. She comes back shortly after saying sorry I didn't ask and said she will have her manager bill it at the bottomless rate they offer on Saturdays. When the bill comes they were taken off completely!! This was not expected,  required or needed but a very generous gesture! Leaves a great impression on my 2nd visit of many to come.",

I consider Chelsea's to be one of those main staple restaurants in Arizona that is a must try for people visiting and residents to visit occasionally.  I have been here quite a few times and I have never been disappointed with the food or service.  Every time I visit Chelsea's the parking lot and the restaurant are packed.  The thing that excites me about Chelsea's is that on most of there dishes they add a little unexpected twist on a traditional dish that is very well accepted.  The all-season fries are very good since they make them in-house to order.  The fish options, burgers, and salad's are very well executed as well.  The patio is very nice to relax and enjoy your meal if the weather is nice.  Oh! The homemade sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door are amazing.",

I realllly wanted to sit out back under the lights because the vibe is so amazing but when we got there at 6 the wait for the back patio was 40 min so we just sat out front. They also don't take reservations for parties less than 10 or maybe was it 8, so if you want that backyard vibe I suggest getting there earlier.  We sat out in front which was a cozy patio, except it was super cozy that you could hear everyone's conversations around you. The tables were also really wobbly and guests waiting for a table were literally sitting below your legs on the benches. That was kinda odd. Verrry intimate.   Our server was Christina and she was great. I couldn't decide what to order, I was literally debating between 3 things and she narrowed it down for me- The wood fired rotisserie with potatoes. My sister got the prime rib also with the potatoes and the purple hands wine. I got an ice tea (which I believe is the same kind lgo brews) it's delicious. The wine was a little on the pricey side being $24 for a pint- we would've been better off just buying the bottle. However the wine was so good, too bad you can't buy it in AZ. Everything was cooked to perfection. The potatoes were out of this world, I was so full but could not stop eating them. The dessert looked amazing but we ate so much we couldn't bare another bite. My sister loved her prime rib and also- the cooked it to a perfect mid rare, she also was obsessed with the potatoes.   The server was great and even tho we didn't have much meat leftover, she suggested taking it to go if we had a dog at home. Let's just say, my Vizsla was very happy!",

Opted for their Ceviche. We each had one cocktail & had to leave to catch the show we had booked. We got super sick from the Ceviche. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the ambience. The patio seating is great. Stay away from the Ceviche.",

Also, don't forget to grab yourself a chocolate chip cookie on the way out.",

I have been here several times for meetings and my experience has always been consistent and enjoyable.   I have recently had the green chile cornbread, the green chile burger, and deviled eggs. All were fantastic and cooked wonderfully. The food is awesome. The vibe is awesome. Sitting out on the patio, very enjoyable and relaxing environment.   The staff is so kind, attentive, on their game and take care of their guests very well. My last visit the manager came and asked how everything was and I like that service. It's important for the customer experience and vital to keeping a business thriving. I appreciate that greatly and can't tell you how long that goes with me.   Two personal pet peeves but doesn't bother my review. Texas Pete hot sauce because I lived in Winston Salem, I dislike the hot sauce very much. Also, parking with the valet is annoying but so be it, it's complementary when you go there so I'm sure the restaurant pays for that service.   No negative things I love coming here and I've had great experiences every time.",

    "text": "NomNomz: 5/5 Libations: 5/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: A little fancy, trendy  Nomz: Amazing every time I go! Some delicious starter options ($5-$16). The Deviled eggs are out of this world, and a decent size order as well. Topped with crispy bacon flakes (if you want) you'll be in food-heaven. The Tuna Tartare & Guac ($16) is another top order for us. Next. My go-to brunch indulgence is the Eggs Benedict ($16), but they offer a Crab Cake Benedict as well ($20). Another popular breakfast dish is always the Huevos Rancheros ($16) and Chilaquiles! ($16). I've always wanted to try the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes ($14), they always look delightful. They've got a few salads on the menu ($14-$16; the Tuna Sashimi is my fave), a few mouthwatering burger selections at $15 (+ Ahi Tuna Burger $16), Grilled Salmon ($26), Prime Rib ($27), Short Rib Tacos ($22), Grilled Swordfish ($23) + more! They've got some great sides, as well (all $6). We have a tradition where we always start with the fries. It's a heaping order, but you'll be surprised how quickly they go down because they are probably the best fries I've EVER had. No joke! The seasoning they put on it is like crack, once you start you can't stop. But seriously...  Libations: There's always a wait if you don't go pretty much when the doors open (to get a table on the patio, and let's face it, the patio is the sh*t) so we usually wait at the bar and grab a quick drink. Their white sangria is some of the best sangria I've ever had. They serve it by glass or pitcher, so pitcher recommended if everyone wants a glass ($8/$25). They've got a pretty decent sized wine list ($9-$10), a few really great beers, and great cocktails to select from as well, I've been wanting to try their Prickly Pear Marg! ($11) Next time for sure.   Service: I've had some absolutely stellar service here, but then I've had a couple cranky ones that aren't very pleasant. It's a bit of a hit or miss sometimes. I'd say majority I've had amazing, but some left me wondering why that person works there :/  Treats: There are free cookies on your way out the door (sea salt, choc chip) you won't want to pass up on no matter how full you are.   Overall experience: I always plan a brunch here when friends come to visit. Beautiful on the patio when the flowers are bloomed around the patio. It's a bit of a bird haven with all the flowers and trees surrounding you. I love it, but if you have a fear of birds then that's your call. It's worth it though.

Hostess and bartender were so off-putting (curt, impersonal, seemingly disinterested and annoyed) that it influenced the overall experience. Our server was adequate but also somewhat disengaged. Our meal met expectations but because every interaction with the staff felt like we were a number in a cattle call, all three of us wished we dined elsewhere. Really sad, I can't say that I will elect to go again any time soon.",

The good news was, the leaves that fell into our drinks and food hopefully soaked up some of the ashes from the fire.  The service was spotty at best and the prices are too high for the food quality, the service and the entire experience.

    "text": "Solid food, atmosphere, service and variety.  HOWEVER, a major (and surprising) screw-up is that their \"Grilled Salmon\" is FARMED!! Boo! And it's NOT DISCLOSED as such on the menu. In fact, it's actually blatantly misleading/borderline False advertising, as just an inch above the salmon item on the menu, it states \"using only premium, domestic, and organic meats of the highest quality.\"    Most people would rightly assume based on this statement that the salmon is not farmed, but is wild. So they are not likely to bother asking the server if the salmon is farmed. And at $25, especially so.  We did ask and were really surprised to hear it was. Beyond \"yes,\" there was no info given as to where the salmon farm is, whether the farm is sustainable, organic, etc.  This is a glaring omission at least and a blatant attempt to mislead at worst. This review is meant to alert those thinking of ordering it so they can make an informed decision, as well as a request to management to change either the type of fish or how it's presented on the menu.   Note, I understand farmed salmon is extremely common and becoming more so and shouldn't surprise diners to find it on many menus. However, when there is a statement specifically leads one to believe it isn't, we have a problem.  Why such a big deal? Depending on the type (and location) of the farm, farmed salmon can be MUCH different nutritionally from wild. I know some say there are sustainability/contamination (Mercury) issues and there is a debate about the differences. However, it should be transparent what you're getting.   On other notes:   Brussels Salad at $15 w/o meat is overpriced by a lot. Also, there are TONS of dried cranberries on there which aren't disclosed on menu. Overall it's just OK. Also, be sure to ask about the dressing as that is missing from menu too and may not be to your liking.   Deviled eggs are a bargain (6 halves for $7) but really pretty bland.  Tuna tartare is also pretty bland.",

It is a very nice looking restaurant inside, and it is kind of serene tucked inside an area dense with trees in the midst of a bunch of other businesses.  I had no qualms with the service either. That was just fine. The reason I have a hard time rating Chelsea's anything higher than a 3-star is simply that the food was just...underwhelming. The hype + the cost had us both expecting to be blown away, but the suggested short rib tacos and green chili burger didn't live up to comparable items at other restaurants for a fraction of the price.  I would still say it was a pleasant dining experience, but there are plenty of other places in the valley that offer more flavorful food and at far better costs.  -------------------------------UPDATE-------------------------------  I have to hand it to Chelsea's. Customer service-wise, they are a shining example to all other restaurants in the valley. Due to my original 3-star review, the management asked that we give them another chance, and invited us back, on them. This time we tried the chicken nachos, which were tasty and filling. So filling that we were unable to finish even half of the burger we'd both ordered.  We brought this kids this time, and they can be difficult, but Chelsea's was completely accommodating. This restaurant may appeal to the well-to-do, but the service is anything but pretentious. The servers and the management are masters in customer service.",

    "text": "Curious who Chelsea's namesake came from??  Whoever is the inspiration:  THANK YOU for the fresh ingredients (local markets), Jidori (free range) Chicken is used:  \"It's like Kobe beef but for chicken\", some organic ingredients & gluten free dishes available or can be modified to your needs.  They have a kids menu which is free 3-6pm daily.  And a great $5 happy hour drinks from 3-6 as well. Hmmmmm I personally think that's good timing haha!!    Also, must try their Weekend Brunch with their unlimited mimosas for $12 pp. Thank goodness it's walking distance & they have a bike rack for us locals!!  Now our food was amazingly delicious:    SEAFOOD PAELLA (mussels, shrimp, chorizo, jidori chicken, green chile, rice) is a definite must have again!  The jidori chicken placed on top of dish was moist & the skin easily peeled off. My niece loved the mussels!  REAL Corn Bread w/ Green Chile made at Chelsea's gluten free and in limited quantities cause it's fresh & yummy!  Market fresh vegetable was sauteed Broccoli di Cicco (Calabrian chile vinegar, Parmesan Reggiano, house-made breadcrumbs) \rFRENCH PRESS Coffee- Organic Coffee (MR. ESPRESSO oakwood-roasted organic coffee from Oakland, California) woke me up very nicely.  And it's a very open feeling with great decor inside or out with local Plants abounding & next to canal. Quite beautiful AZ landscaping.  The staff & Steve W. was very friendly & professional.  Steve gave me great recommendations for next time at Chelsea's & other LGO's locations. Yummmmm can't wait to try more.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Chelsea's with friends on a Saturday night. First, our waitress was not very attentive at all and never introduced herself. She didn't offer suggestions or a smile, ever. She just stood at our table like an annoyed waitress from a dive diner who hates her job. We ordered two bottles of wine which turned out to be very good for the price.  My husband had the short rib tacos which were wonderful and plenty of food.  I had the Brussels sprout salad with salmon. I was disappointed with the size of the salmon filet, it seemed to be about 1\"strip of fish. Maybe a third of what you'll expect when ordering a salmon fillet at a restaurant. The salad was fresh, but way too sweet and for many that is not an issue but for me I prefer a more tangy dressing. This was a pretty bland salad. My daughter ordered the hamburger and she liked it well enough but felt it was to thick and difficult to pick up and eat. Our friends ordered the grouper and filet mignon. I didn't taste theirs but per their report everything was just  \"okay\" ,not outstanding or memorable. The patio atmosphere was the most redeeming aspect of our dinner. Beautiful ambience.  I will probably not come back to Chelsea's. Mainly because this was our suggestion for taking our friends to for dinner and the waitress was unbelievably awful and ruined our entire experience.  Another negative for this place is your only option for parking is to use their valet, ughh!!",

    "text": "My wife and I picked this restaurant at random as a place to go for our anniversary dinner this year. Not knowing what to expect, I had low expectations. I'm happy to report that Chelsea's Kitchen far exceeded those expectations in every way. We arrived around 6:30p on a Thursday evening (no reservation) and were given a 25 to 30 minute wait time. We ended up waiting only about 15 minutes and were seated on the patio near the big fireplace.  My wife prefers not to sit outside so I thought this might be a problem but they had heaters placed all around the patio so it honestly felt like we were indoors. Cozy ambiance, string lights and trees to hide the road and cars - very nice setting. Tables were spaced far enough apart that we could talk at a normal volume and not have to overhear others' conversations.  Our waiter was attentive without being overly intrusive. I ordered the swordfish taco platter and my wife the short rib tacos. Both plates were delicious. The tacos come out with all the meat and fixings (guac, pico, kale slaw, sauce, etc) and then they bring you out fresh hot street-sized corn tortillas, as many as you need - and you build your own tacos. Serving sizes were large enough that neither of us could finish our plate and had to get a box.  Chelsea's is definitely one of our top restaurants in the Arcadia district. The prices are a little high for us so it will probably be a place for special occasions but definitely worth every penny. Highly recommend it.",

I could have had 5 orders of that myself. I'm still craving it now.  Also had a mimosa, the hot cakes with a side of bacon.  I personally didn't like the hotcakes but a couple gals at our table tried it and they enjoyed it.   My only one tiny complaint is the shedding of the trees above all the patio tables. They do give tons of shade so I cant complain too much. Just make sure to watch when you take a bite or drink that you don't take in twigs or leaves.  The server even had twigs in the water jug she used to fill our waters so one of us had the surprise twig added to her water.  Oh and have a friend check your hair before you leave to get all the leaves out of your hair. Yeah, you'll look like a couple of monkeys searching for bugs in their fur, but everyone else would be doing it too.  Looking forward to going back for lunch and dinner and having more deviled eggs!",

And don't you dare forget to grab a (free) salted chocolate chip cookie (or 2) on your way out.    The only reason I'm not giving Chelsea's that fifth star is because of an incredibly rude server I spoke with today.  I called to make a reservation for my best friend CHELSEA's birthday this week and was told they only can book for 12+.  I asked if they could make an exception for 8 people and she said 8 isn't 12, sorry.   I wish she would have been a littler nicer - kindness goes along way, especially in the service industry.  Will still be going back because this is one of my favorite places in Phoenix, but beware of their policy and the varied customer service.",

Now that I've got the good stuff out of the way, I thought the food was bland and overpriced. I paid $18 for a tasteless serving of short rib tacos. The meat was tender and juicy but had no flavor *at all*. I did enjoy the small kale salad on the side of the plate and the fresh corn tortillas were amazing but the main part of the dish was pretty boring for how much I paid for it. My dining partner had a cheeseburger, which was pretty good in comparison, but those are pretty hard to mess up, but for $13 it could have been better also.   Another reviewer mentioned the lack of people of color. I noticed that too about this place but I feel that way about a lot of Phoenix establishments, it's a remnant of the enforced segregation in Phoenix that ended not too long ago.

    "text": "Believe the hype about Chelsea's Kitchen. When in Phoenix, this is the only restaurant that we MUST go to. There are only two negatives I can think of...the parking situation and the lack of reservations.  In the summer we'll eat inside but the patio is a must when the weather is nice. You have to get the tuna tartare & guacamole. It's one of the best appetizers you'll eat. I always get the short rib taco platter and leave with a doggie bag every time. They'll even give you extra house-made tortillas for your left overs! I've also had the brussels sprout salad, the kale and quinoa salad, the green chili burger and the ahi tuna taco platter. You really can't go wrong.  On the way out, don't forget to grab a freshly baked sea salt cookie!",

After having a fantastic brunch (we made reservations) we even went back again to try to place a to go order of their corn bread (note: only available in person and after 5). My mom and sister are gluten free and the corn bread was absolute heaven - even for someone without an allergy. We also had the sangria (yum!) which was a great price for a pitcher to share - the Brussel sprout salad and the kale and quinoa salad. The special of the day was also delicious. You have to try this place!!!",

There was barely any amount in the bowl, as well. They forgot to order the cornbread, so that never arrived. The burger kept sliding out of the bun.  The steak was tough, undercook and had to be recooked. I have eaten here before many times and it was great, but after yesterday, I will never return.  Yuk!",

I thought the restaurant was loud and there were quite a few tables that were open.  On to the food:  1. Appetizers: Deviled Eggs with bacon were excellent so were the nachos. My suggestion would be to layer the cheese because once you get below the toppings you are simply eating chip. 2. We all shared the Brussels sprout salad and it is unique and very tasty. 3. Main course: I had the prime rib, below average at best. Very dry and lacking flavor. My girlfriend had the chicken, again very dry and no flavor. The others in our group had the short rib tacos, very good, the ahi tuna with guacamole, again very good. I was disappointed with the prime rib and even mentioned it to the waitress...no manager came to the table and I certainly didn't feel it is her responsibility to apologize for the chef but I think a table call would have been nice.  We will go back but I will only order what I know they make well. Nice ambiance if you are looking for a less than intimate environment.",

The Nachitos are so simple, but done to perfection.

But I have to say I'm not thrilled with the food. The veggie options are ok, at least there is more than one choice. The flavor is less impressive though. The veggie tacos were blander than bland. The actual veggies are lovely and change seasonally: spaghetti squash, mushrooms, peppers, etc. But can I get a little salt and pepper on these bad boys? They tasted like nothing.  The veggie burger is the same as LGO, but was perhaps prepared differently. I didn't get any of that smokey goodness I love so much at the sister restaurant. The guacamole was also lacking. Good thing they brought out a few orders of those little handmade tortillas though, cuz those suckers are melt in your mouth deliciosos.  There is also a happy ending on your way out with some killer sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Between the wine and cookies, I'm good. Just wish there was a little more oomph to back up the price of the meatless fare.",

It was my first try, and ordered the Egg Benedict, friends ordered the French omelet and the Daydreamer, presentations on all dishes were great, colorful and a sense of healthy. However, they were very salty, I mean really salty. Especially the canadian bacon in my egg benedict, I only had one piece, and that was swallowed with all the spinach, egg and muffin, plus the oj... I don't know how could it be that salty, but it was. I had to stop at the 2nd piece, I don't wanna spend the rest of my day with bottles of water... the French omelet according to my friend was good, but the Daydreamer, was a bit on salty side as well... I guess we just ordered the wrong food....  If you have allergies, I don't recommend you have the backyard seating., at least don't do it on a windy day. It's a bit windy yesterday, and while the 2 hours we were outside, every time the wind blew, the little flowers on the tree went flying everywhere, our hair, our table, and food! My friend was literally sneezing non-stop.. so just a little note to consider your own health.",

    "text": "Short Version: 5/5 on service and 4/5 on food. Great consistent service and food. Get the Surf and Turf Tacos or the Salmon or The Fish of The Day. Best Arnold Palmer I've ever had! BRING BACK THE LOBSTER SLIDERS!!!   Long Version: I come here a couple times a week at least because it's very close to where I work. It can get spendy coming here so frequently, but you know exactly what you're getting and the type of service you'll receive. This restaurant seems to have their process locked down. There can be a wait some times during peak hours, so try coming 30 minutes before or after 12.   I typically get 1 of 3 things which are all great: Salmon, Fish of the Day or The Surf and Turf Tacos.   The salmon is baked perfectly so it's not too dry and not undercooked. It comes on a bed of the vegetables of the moment so it changes a bit from week to week.   Their Fish of the Day obviously changes, but I've never had a bad one. Yesterday I had the Striped Sea Bass and it was awesome. It was fried so the skin was perfectly crisp, but the fish meat was moist and juicy. It came on top of artichoke hearts, which were also perfectly tender.   The Surf and Turf Tacos come with tortillas, a side of Kale Salad, Filet Mignon and Seasoned Shrimp. Pretty self explanatory, but part of what makes this one so tasty is the chipotle sauce that comes with your tacos. You make your own tacos so I'm usually liberal with the chipotle sauce. I never end up with enough tortillas though so I always have to ask for more. The tortillas are on the thicker side, but very soft.  Last but not least, my absolute favorite thing at Chelsea's Kitchen that would've given them a full 5 out of 5 stars but they got rid of it, THE LOBSTER SLIDERS. It was a perfectly crisp lightly battered (perfect, not heavy at all) fried lobster with bacon inside two soft slider buns. Everyone at our office was pretty upset that they got rid of this. Total bummer.  The Arnold Palmer is so perfect. Fresh made lemonade and they do a funky thing with egg whites to create a fun foam in it. You don't taste any eggs in it, don't worry. Get it!",

    "text": "After driving past numerous times because it looked too crowded, we finally stepped foot into Chelsea's Kitchen last night.  It didn't start off too great, I found myself frustrated with the host chatting up some guy who seemed to be already seated with another  party or something like that.  I was hungry and got more annoyed than needed, but it's not that hard to stop your conversation and get us seated!  That said, as soon as she did acknowledge us, we were seated immediately.  Our waitress, can't recall her name, was extremely friendly. I'm not much of a wine drinker, so I can't comment on that, but I was impressed by the small but delicious beers on tap.  From the typical four peaks, to a Deschutes Mirror Pond and an O'dell's 90 schilling, I was a happy man.  In additon to the menu, they also offered some daily specials, from starters, to mains, to sides.  We had an appetizer on special that day, a \"new style\" sashimi. Slices of tuna and yellowfin, with a ponzu sauce, picked wasabi, slices of hit green chiles.  It was delicious, my only complaint was that I wanted much more.  The menu is comprised of varieties of tacos, burgers, and salads. A few fresh fish mains and other seasonal mains made the menu varied but not too big.  It was still hard to make a choice.  We had decided to get the howie burger, but didn't know what else. Our waitress recommended first timers to Chelsea's to partake of one of the taco meals.  She called it a good introduction to Chelsea's.  In the end, we went with the Howie burger and the short rib tacos.  The tacos, which are presented in a \"make your own\" style were delicious, the braised short ribs extremely flavorful and tender.  salsa fresca, guacamole, rice, beans and salsa complemented the very fresh tortillas.  The Howie burger, made up of a hand ground patty, came with gruyere and freaking delicious carmelized onions that still managed to be tangy as well. I need to figure out how to do that at home.  I got it with a bun, although you can get it sans bun or with lettuce.  I opted for some fries, but could have gotten other sides.  Being a former vegetarian, it's nice to see a few options for our meatless friends/fiends.  The whole floor team is very efficient, water was always full, food was put out quickly.  If you get up from your chair, someone will refold your napkin.  A nice old school touch.  We had some good organic coffee and a pretty amazing key lime pie. The pie was also great because they DON\"T USE FOOD COLORING! That is one of my biggest pet peeves, real key lime pie comes out yellow, don't color it green my friends.  For a starter, multiple beers, two meals, coffee and dessert, when you added a generous tip, we still came up around $100.  When you consider the wonderful food, great atmosphere, and amazing service, I think it may possibly be one of the best deals in Phoenix!  It was also great to see many different generations of diners.  From little ones to the older folks, all seemed to have a wonderful time.  It's safe to say that we'll be back. I'll just make sure to make a reservation.  This place is always crowded!",

I got the green chile burger and fries and despite help from DH, I still couldn't finish this overwhelming sized burger and fries.  Bring a friend or an enormous appetite when you go.  Delicious food: guacamole was chunky and fresh, salsa was spicy and chips were freshly made, burger was good, but perhaps not a date nite food due to sloppy spill factor, coffee was terrific and orange juice was fresh squeezed.  DH got the Chilaquiles and LOVED them.  I snuck a little taste and loved the mix of red ranchero and green salsa pools at the bottom of his plate.

So many taste bud pleasers in one dish; from the sweetness of the grapes to the salty parmesan cheese to the earthy Kale to vibrant lemon vinaigrette. Then I had the short ribs for my main dish. omg! So tender and perfectly cooked. No knife needed to cut into these delicious little pieces of meat heaven. They are nestled on top of mashed potatoes that would make grandma cry- they're so good and creamy. Then I finished with a scoop of one of their seasonal gelato - peanut butter chunk. Whew! So delicious.  ** notes I love the simplicity of the decor but the attention to all the little details.",

I was feeling indecisive on what to drink, so he asked me my likes and dislikes and came up with one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had.   The shredded kale salad is spectacular and you're safe with any type of taco--they're through the roof. The Mac and cheese is a bit too greasy and cheesy for my taste but dessert is always a winner. Try the key lime pie and cornbread cake with dark chocolate icing (my personal favorite).   Inside or outside, you're guaranteed great ambience. The patio is one of the best in Phoenix--huge with beautiful trees and fireplace.   So, with all these wonderful factors, why is the service so consistently so-so? Last night we were greeted and then had to wait 20 minutes before asking a passing hostess to take our order. The server never apologized or even acknowledged the incident and was very aloof the entire evening. The fact that we were there for a celebration made her behavior even more disappointing. On previous occasions we've been ignored like this too, so I expect this low-grade service to be the norm.   To be safe, sit at the bar!",

A waitress spilt wine, thank god it was white, on my sister who had a cute outfit on and not only was she apologetic and helpful, so were the other waiters and waitresses. The manager rushed over and handed us a 20 dollar bill for dry cleaning and a $25 gift card for the restaurant, I heard the bar staff asking our bartender to get us our drinks immediately which were comped. Way to make us happy after a sour accident!",

I love that place!\" Every time I search the menu, order something I don't really want because nothing sounds that appealing, pay too much for something I don't want, then go home bitter and vow I will never go back there again.

I always hear from people at the airport that the street side location is so nice and I have to say I agree. It's so pretty, the layout and the patio area was gorgeous the day we went since the weather cooperated. Since the street side location has more items than the airport, I decided to venture to give them a try, such as the lobster slidersand the mac and cheese, both items that I wish were available at the airport cause they were delicious. The service was awesome; the staff were really friendly.  Next time, I totally need to try the veggie tacos or the tuna burger. My mom liked her Howie burger and I told her to get it with the kale slaw, but I ended up eating her kale slaw and she had to get a side order of fries lol. I really wanted to do dessert, but that didn't happen cause I should have known better; I should have known to leave room for dessert. I know, I was a ditz that day and wasn't thinking, but next time I'm all over it.",

The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic.  The signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you daintifully sip your way into alcoholic bliss.  The oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' situation.   The cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure. They soothe the restless 'fat kid' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving Cheslea's Kitchen a bit more bearable",

We started with the guacamole and chips - which were to die for.   We each fought over it.   As soon as our chip stash started to dwindle another plate arrived...that never happens (unless you are at a mexican restaurant)  I ordered the brussel sprout salad and it was amazing.  the ingredients were so fresh and plentiful.    The only thing was the service was a bit slow - even for us arriving so early and it not being crowded it did seem like it took quite some time to get our main orders in and then to get the check when we were done.     Oh and I did I mention the yummy chocolate chip cookies waiting at the front door when you leave...I only grabbed one, but it was soooo delish!

Our first time dining here, we were ravenous, so we ordered the nachos thinking it would be a good small starter. Except it was huge. And we were SO stuffed that we ended up getting our entrees to go, hah! The short rib tacos and burger were delicious even the next day after.   On our most recent visit, I tried the Prickly Pear Margarita - it was ok, but tasted more like a slightly spiked tart lemonade. Meh. You can't win 'em all, I guess. We also tried the deviled egg - really good, but I mean, come on. I have yet to meet a deviled egg that I didn't like.   My cousin ordered the kale salad with grilled salmon and it was superb. LGO does a great salad - at any of their locations. The Green Chile and Howie burgers were amazing. Now that, my friends is how you do a burger. And the fries? Now THOSE are crack fries.   Yeah, it's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it for the quality. Will definitely be back to try brunch out on the gorgeous patio before it heats up too much.

Sat down outside and got a Bloody Mary and sangria at the bar. The time didn't go by too slow and before we knew it we got a text letting us know the table was ready. To start we had the chips and guac. FIRE stuff right there. We also asked for lemons with our waters 3 different times and they never came. Food was great and came out the kitchen quickly. Had the eggs Benedict and hotcakes. WOW. Delicious.",

The overall review of this place is so promising that we did not mind waiting quite a bit for a table. The ambiance was nice, casual, and has a friendly atmosphere.  We finally got a table after waited for about half-an-hour. We were seated outside, which was even better atmosphere. I ordered Tuna Sashimi Salad for a starter and Wood-fired Rotisserie Chicken (served with homemade spaetzle and chicken jus). While my husband ordered Chelsea's Cheeseburger.  Long story short, loved everything that we ordered EXCEPT the Wood-fired Rotisserie Chicken. It's hardly cooked, although I didn't see any blood, but it was nearly inedible. I was so put off by it that I just want to get our bill and get the heck out of there and vowed never to return. The waitress found out about the chicken when she cleaned the table and noticed that the chicken was not fully cooked. She apologized and said that we wouldn't be charged for it.  I would have given this place 4-5 stars had it not been the lousy house specialty. It was the one that really ruined my experience. It was a total waste of time and money.",

    "text": "I've been to Chelsea's in the past so this really isn't my first time here nor was it my only great experience but that was my pre-Yelping days so here it goes.  I took my mother here today for a second Mother's Day outing and arrived a little after opening which was good as the place was packed by noon. The hostess was friendly and sat us at a booth. I love the interior of this place; lots of brick, stone, wood and high ceilings not to mention a beautiful bar overlooking the patio which I will definitely be returning to check out more closely.   Started out by ordering the Prickly Pear Margarita...so yummy and it's a pretty drink (hot pink). Perfect for the hot weather. We split the Del Mar Salad...amazing! The shrimp and crab tasted fresh and there were generous portions of both along with jicama, avocado, and tomatoes. Afterwards, we split the French Dip with fries. The meat was so tender and delicious! Next time, I'll probably add cheese as I felt it was only missing a slight something. The fries were yummy and they tasted like they were seasoned with something sweet...unexpected but good none the less.  Our server was Cara and she was great.She was very friendly without seeming fake and over the top.   My only problem is how to avoid going to Chelsea's Kitchen all the time as I've moved in right near by. I guess I'll need to remind myself that while it isn't unreasonably priced, it's not the cheapest either. Who knows if that will even stop me?",

However, I am a patio lover, so I prefer sitting outside, at the caved in by trees and umbrellas patio, with a mighty fine fireplace!!  Our food was just okay, I had their Green Chile Burger and It was good, It could have been better, I'm sure. It was just missing a kick, maybe complementing veggies or sauce?? I'm not sure, but something!! Honestly, I don't really eat burgers all that much, but when I crave a fatty burger I expect it to be amazing and nothing less, come on now!!! :)  We also had the ceviche as our appetizer and that was delicious, super small portion though, that is the reasoning for my 4 stars this time, such a small portion on one of my favorite dishes, CEVICHE!!! OH WELL :) Other than that we enjoyed the bottomless Mimosas and a fine pitcher of the oh soo delisiosa Sangria!! YUM!!   No dessert, or tummies were full of Sangria and Mimosas!!!  What a heartbreak  :)    Parking is impossible during peak hours, so be early!! :)",

The ambiance here is unparalleled. Best patio in Phoenix hands down.   What I continually struggle with here is the hostess and seating rules. There are just too many rules and it's not welcoming to guests. I feel like it is stressful to get a table because of all the rules.   1. Only take a certain number of reservations. 2. No reservation for party less than 6 people. 3. No reservations for the patio. 4. Whole party must be there before seating. No exceptions. 5. If there is no wait when you arrive, but not everyone with you - then you wait and they seat other groups ahead of you to the point when there may now be a wait for a table when your whole group arrives.  The list goes on. I get the logic for the rules but it seems like there has to be a better way. It is a big turn off to enter a beautiful restaurant and then be bombarded with instructions from the hostess. I mean, I need cliff notes to have dinner here.   I just feel like dinner shouldn't be that complicated for the guests. It should be easy, fun, and delicious. Nothing more.",

    "text": "Chelsea's Kitchen is the perfect Sunday brunch location.  Brunch is the best meal.  Why is that?  Because you can drink and eat breakfast at the same time.  You can't drink at breakfast . . . that is frowned upon.  You sort of can't eat breakfast food at lunch or dinner, unless you are at Denny's.    And I only go to Denny's after a night of partying . . . but back to Chelsea's Kitchen.  Chelsea's Kitchen is the best place in town to go for brunch.  It may not be the best thing since sliced bread but I can't imagine going anywhere else for brunch.  Meal:  I got the hash, a mimosa, sangria, and coffee.  The fiance got veggie omelet and she went with a bloody mary.  Taste:  The drinks are great!  The hash was a slight disappointment as the beed was a little dry.  The fiance's dish was great.  Hopefully next time they don't run out of the ingredients to make eggs Benny. 7 out of 10.  Value:  It is slightly on the price side.  The drink sizes are generous.  I feel that given the taste of the meal and the portion sizes, the value is above average.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  One of the things that I rarely see at a restaurant is waitresses helping each other at and managers who are willing to lend a helping hand when it gets busy.  That helps make things run efficiently and minimizes delays.  Chelsea's Kitchen did both of these things and the service we received was the highlight of the meal.  10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  We sat outside.  Leaves were falling.  Fire place was going.  It was a perfect day to eat outside.  The overall decor is clean, classic,  and timeless without appearing to be stale. 5 out of 5.  Overall:  I think Chelsea's Kitchen is one of those places you can make it a weekly staple.  It can become a weekly tradition.  I recommend getting there at around 10 am or so on Sundays.  Any earlier its packed and going later just takes the fun out of having brunch. 26 out of 30 points, 4 out of 5 stars.",

What we were served was overpowering red onion with a small couple of pieces of zucchini that tasted of onion. Mashed potatoes were cold. What I hate the most is \"free valet\" at restaurants. No valet when we arrived but they were setting up when we left. The attendants had cones so close to existing cars that they were being caught on cars when patrons tried to leave which was followed by an attendant kicking the cones around. I guess he wanted to let everyone know either his dissatisfaction or show his laziness. Either way it was a poor representation for the establishment.",

The flavors were supposed to dance in my mouth...rather they laid there doing nothing.  Which is why the 4 stars instead of 5.  If I could do 4.5 I probably would because everybody else in our party of 6 really enjoyed their meals.

We started off with drinks Goodnight Emilie was fantastic!  The perfect amount of mint to balance the grapefruit flavor.  My boyfriend had the Mageuy Mule.  If that is your kind of drink then you will love it.  He thought it was great but it's not my favorite.   Starter: We tried the plain chips and guac.  The guac was good but nothing to write home about.  The salsa however!  We practically were licking the bowl.   Main Meal: I had the Paella and he had the Surf and Turf Tacos.  Both were awesome.  Mine actually had so much leftover we ate it the following day for dinner!  The blend of flavors in the Paella is well worth the trip.  The chorizo they mixed in topped it off.  The surf and turf (again more my boyfriend's thing) was beautifully presented.  He is very picky when it comes to his steak.  The steak for the tacos was according to him \"Perfect\" and he even said to get it to taste that way takes time and care.    We did go for a date night on this one and the atmosphere was romantic but not too stuffy.  The staff was friendly but what was even more fun was most of the other people there were friendly, fun and out for a good time too.  Families, couples, all ages.",

This place is perfect for special occasions...but don't let that stop you from going there just for fun! Their cornbread and deviled egg appetizers were amazing as were there entrees. I got the chicken and my husband got the tacos--yum!   The ambiance was also perfect.  They have a super cute patio with lights and a beautiful outdoor fireplace.  In addition, their staff was extremely friendly and helpful. If I could eat at Chelsea's Kitchen everyday, I would! I am still dreaming about our dinner there.  I can't wait to go there again! Until next time, Chelsea's Kitchen!!!",

We had the cornbread which was AMAZING! The green chilli was so good in the cornbread.  The short rib tacos looked amazing, but were a bit one dimensional.   The French fries were AMAZING! They were seasoned and thin and crispy. Really outstanding!  The the service was 5/5. The food was 4/5. We will be back for sure. The menu seems to have so many things we want to try.",

After checking out the menu I went with the Chelsea's Eggs Benedict, they were made with LGO's English muffins, if you ever been to LGO, then you already know these muffins are amazing and bigger than a normal muffin, so I asked for extra hollandaise sauce, just so every bite was covered in goodness.   When my order came, not only was it saucy, it also came with a little extra more of hollandaise sauce, it was nice to see they were not stingy with the sauce.  When I ordered it I didn't ask or pay attend to see if the meal came with potatoes, I just assumed potatoes would come with it, because in my head, breakfast potatoes and hollandaise sauce are amazing together too. But no, it comes with a small bowl of fresh fruit. Next time I know to order a side of potatoes.  Also not on the brunch menu is the Chicken Nachitos, but you can in fact order them at brunch, if you haven't had them, you really should, and there is plenty to share.   Another great meal at Chelsea's Kitchen, I'm sure I'll be back around soon.",

She said she'd void the charges and then split the tab between two cards. Great.   The problem? The charge was never voided. Called and the manager said he'd take care of it with the accounting department to reverse the charge. Nope. Called manager again, said he'd check and never called back.   So, we paid $300 for a bill that should have cost us $100.  Hello Customer Service!! We've spent too much time dealing with this!",

Along came our server after we sat down and she was amazing right off the bat. She was personable, knowledgeable, and had great energy. We ordered the nachos, surf and turf tacos, and short rib tacos. Everything was beyond our expectations. These tacos are there than some Mexican restaurants! The surf and turf was an obvious favorite - the steak was so tender and the lobster was so fresh.   On top of that, our nachos took longer than they should (didn't even realize it because I was enjoying myself so much) that the server then offered us red velvet cake and gelato. It's the small things people!! Great customer service sticks with you and this is exactly what this server did. I'll be back, with many more friends!!!",

I typically like coming here for brunch and sad to hear they discontinued their bottomless mimosas. However, you can still get 1/2 off bottles of champagne with juices included. The chilaquiles is my ultimate favorite. They fresh squeeze their juices everyday. The Wycliff champagne is my favorite (that's what they used to use for bottomless) it's a Brut. Iesha helped us at the outside bar today on this beautiful morning. She was super helpful and took a picture of me and my boyfriend celebrating on his birthday weekend. She also recommended the lemon hot cakes next time. To top it off the manager stopped by and gave us a free lemon cheesecake and strawberry sorbet....yum & yum! can't wait to come back, great service!!",

Parking lot is tight and you'll have to valet most likely.   Well worth checking it out!",

This visit was great also - we are stuffed. Definitely a great place for brunch. The environment is cozy inside with the real fireplace crackling away and then outside you can dine on the patio where there is another fireplace. In the front there is a BBQ for the kitchen that makes the whole place smell incredible!",

The food was AWESOME! I had the short rib tacos. The meat melts in your mouth. Came with cooked kale (looked pan fried), tomatoes, mound of guacamole and salsa.    He had a burger and fries, I was so into my food I barely glanced at his but it looked great and he said it was delicious.   We booked the space right then for the large party.

    "text": "This restaurant has a delicious brunch menu. My parents were in town, so we decided to try a new place that has been recommended to me many times. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 10:45 and were seated with no wait, so I was pleasantly surprised!! My parents chose to sit inside, but if you love a good atmosphere and the weather is nice, the patio out back is adorable! We ordered the highly recommended cornbread w/ green Chile and it definitely delivered. It's served in the square cast iron skillet it is baked in, so there's plenty of crispy sides to go around! It's cut into four generous triangles and each bite is full of green chile and corn. My dad also wanted to try the deviled eggs with bacon. He really enjoyed them but since I am not the biggest fan of deviled eggs, I defer judgment to him. He also ordered the roasted broccoli (their seasonal vegetable), which was delicious and had a good amount of acidity that I enjoyed. My mom and I both decided on the Santa Fe style eggs, which comes with what seems to be braised kale, carne adovada, a flavorful and smoky red Chile sauce, two fried eggs over easy, guacamole, and some handmade tortillas on the side. I made little tacos with the tortillas and plenty of filling and each bite was heavenly. I would've liked if the tortillas were kept warm in some sort of container instead of just in some parchment paper on a plate and a tad bit more of the red Chile sauce would've made the dish absolutely perfect. Next time I visit, I will have to save some room for dessert, or at least look at a menu!!",

    "text": "I've now gone here twice and have some mixed feelings about my experience.  Overall, this place definitely has some good factors, but they're missing some consistency.  For example, both waitresses I had recommended the short ribs.  I had them in their tacos during my 1st visit and have to admit they weren't my favorite.  If anything, they should be recommending their Colcannon Potatoes to everyone.  Some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  If these don't come with your food, order a side of them!  The Chelsea's Cheeseburger was decent.  Be aware that the french fries have a strong BBQ seasoning on it.  Picture the flavor of BBQ Lays.  The patio is really nice as long as it's not too hot.  Get there early if you want to sit outside.  Don't forget to grab a cookie on your way out.  Beware of the little crystals on them...they're salt, not sugar.  If you like salty sweet, these will be right up your alley.  Plus, they're free!  You need to try their red velvet cake.  I hate frosting, but I eat every ounce of this cream cheese frosting.  So well balanced and a good density!",

Melts in your mouth would be an understatement - delicious. My friends ordered brisket and they were in heaven.

I chose Chelsea's because of my previous experiences there - CK has always been a go-to place with a consistently fun atmosphere, attentive service, and delicious food.  Yesterday was no exception!  We started with an order of shrimp ceviche for the table. I've had it before and it was just as delicious yesterday as I remember... I love all of the ingredients (avocados, tomatoes, jicama and lime juice) and the lightly salted tortilla chips it comes with are the perfect compliment.  I ordered the Del Mar Salad (gulf shrimp & jumbo lump crab on  shredded iceberg with avocado, pico de gallo and olives).  The others at the table had the short rib tacos (see Stephanie's pic above), the ahi tacos, and the brussel sprout salad... I was full after eating all of my food and tasting some of theirs.  But when the table ordered a red velvet cake for dessert (see pic above), I looked at it and I knew I need to have just one bite.  Mmmm - it was heavenly!  Our waiter, Stephen, was pretty heavenly too... :)  I am sure I will return again and again - thanks CK!",

    "text": "This was a second trip for a friend and me, the first being overall extremely positive so decided to unleash it on our significant others. And they were very happy we did. Once again, we were greeted pleasantly at the door and taken to our outdoor table. The patio is such a lovely setting, making you feel secluded in the city. And our server was accommodating as we kept changing tables trying to avoid the sun. Bear in mind, the fact that it is late May and you can dine outdoors without misters speaks well overall for the patio.  Two of us chose brunch (the SW baked eggs) and two chose green chile burgers. The eggs were served in a cast iron dish which really retained heat and allowed the eggs to continue cooking, which was nice as they arrived a little runny but set up nicely as the meal continued. There was no shortage of tender pulled green chile pork and pinto beans in the dish, very flavorful and satisfying. AND it was served with four freshly made corn tortillas. The tortillas were obviously fresh and had good flavor, but I couldn't eat more than one. I was more intent on what was in that little pot of cast iron tastiness!  The burgers came as ordered- medium rare. They were covered in roasted green chiles and I was told the chiles were delicious. The burgers looked good... I will only know for sure when we go back! The only comment I heard about the burger was that the bun seemed a little big for the burger. Fair enough. The french fries that came with it were not your average fries. They are covered in a savory sweet seasoning (think brown sugar with paprika and seasoned salt) and were very good. I'm not sure I could eat a whole order of them, but they were good for sharing.   On the previous trip, I had the brussels sprout salad and was pleasantly surprised as this isn't my favorite veggie but decided to step out a bit. The sprouts were bright and tender. I was asked if I would order it again and my quick answer was no- I need to try other items. I would also kick up the dressing with a little more acidity or salt, just to make it a little more dimensional. And maybe some toasted almonds. Yum!  The menu has a wide variety of items that are sure to please just about anyone and will be added to our list of places to return to.",

Everything tastes fresh and perfectly cooked. My party got an appetizer, several entrees, and dessert. Nothing was less than extravagant. They have many different types of dishes that I'm sure would please even the pickiest of eaters (like myself). On top of all of the food being delicious, I ordered a drink that I didn't particularly care for because it had a certain liquor in it that I wasn't aware of and the server kindly exchanged it for me at no additional charge. Chelsea's Kitchen is fabulous and I highly recommended it to everyone.",

We had to present our voucher to the waitress upon ordering.   In doing so, we felt as if  her mood changed immediately when she saw the voucher.  Maybe it was just our thinking, but we did not receive as good of service as the first time.  She did not box our food or even crack a smile to be honest.    I have to stick with my first review about the food.  I had the steak and my girlfriend had the ahi burger.  She said she liked it more than what she ordered the first time.  I did like my steak, but again the food wasn't hot when it got to our table.  Overall, the food is at best mediocre.

We had the Tuna Sashimi ($18) and Kale & Quinoa ($14) salads.  Both were good!  The key lime pie ($8) is to die for and this wasn't the first time we've had this \"must have\" dessert!  A small gelato ($4) was a decent dessert option for a very reasonable price.  Nice wine and draft beer selections available!  Our server was very helpful in assisted us with a wine choice. - Service 5/5 - server Stephanie P. was attentive, made recommendation as requested and she was pleasant!  A manager and another service assisted with our table and ensured a service experience that was \"top notch!\" - Valet 5/5 - I dislike having to valet my vehicle, but the valet was friendly and even ran out to my vehicle when I forgot my reading glasses!  - Hostess - 5/5 - friendly and we were seated in about 10 minutes.   - The establishment - 4/5 - it is a bit noisy in the restaurant, but it was a Saturday night.  If you are looking for a semi-quiet date night then this might not be the place for you.  Also, with 100+ degree days in Phoenix the open concept in the bar area made the rest of the restaurant a bit warm.  Bottom Line: A restaurant worthy of your patronage!  Overall, high marks for Chelsea's Kitchen!",

The only down was my friend wasn't a fan of the Bloody Mary, although pretty in the wonder women glass! The atmosphere was clean and bright. It will definitely be back and order the devil eggs",

What an excellent man-- very genuine, relatable and personable. As we were about to eat dinner, my dad received a phone call that his father was about to pass on. He wasn't going to be able to sit and enjoy his meal. Cameron took it upon himself to package the food to-go for my dad and then comp'd his meal. We were not expecting this at all! This act of kindness will never be forgotten and left a long-lasting impression, especially, when it was our first time dining at Chelsea's Kitchen. The food was superb, but service is just, if not MORE important. Thank you for a great experience!",

The back patio was beautiful with flowering trees. I was surprised there weren't misters on the patio which would have made it much more comfortable, but we did find tables in the shade so it was okay. We started with the deviled eggs and the tuna tartare & guacamole. I wouldn't normally order deviled eggs at a restaurant but our friend recommended them. They were no-kidding the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten!! The tuna was awesome too! My husband and I split the Howie Burger (havarti, carmelized red onion, and dijon sauce) and the Del Mar Salad. Oh my goodness!... Both were outstanding!! Our server (a young lady) was super nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. The bathrooms were clean (although stall #1 splashed my friend when flushed... yuck!).",

Only complaint is there could have been alot more chicken and cheese--and maybe some mild sliced jalapenos on the side and a little more quac and sour cream, but excellent overall. Also, had the trout lunch special which was trout, sweet potato and some greens that were stir fried.  Good taste--fishy but it was trout which is fishy usually. I love this place, so will be back.  It's kinda hidden and out of the way which I loved myself.  This is a place great for talking to your tablemates or for a romantic dinner.  And one of the things I particularly loved about Chelsea's is that nobody rushes you out the door.  And, by the way, when going out the door look to your right at the bunch of carmel chocolate salted cookies under a glass trifle container--take some for your ride home = they're free! Valet parking which is free, but we came so early we parked ourselves.",

It was the perfect portion and delicious, and tasted very fresh. If I wasn't on a diet, I would have gotten what my friend got, the Chelsea's Kitchen Cheeseburger, which looked sooooo good! I'm going to keep going back there because everything on the menu sounded wonderfully delicious.  The service was awesome too. We were seated immediately, drinks a second later, and it seemed our meal was in front of us within minutes. All the servers were polite and efficient :) The interior design makes it a great place for anything too. My friend and I were just there for a casual lunch, but I can see going there with a large group, or on a date.  I'm certainly going to be a Chelsea's Kitchen patron from now on!",

The soft taco shells come on the side, so you can just attack the Ahi, a little Guac, and the Taco Fixins without restraint.  This is besides the fact that it's a clean, well managed, high service operation.   You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The number of 5 star reviews this place has just baffles me. I have tried... really really tried....to love Chelsea's. The location makes it a popular spot for work lunches and happy hours so I get dragged in here at least once every couple months. With the exception of maybe the short ribs, I have never had anything but mediocre food and mediocre service. I am starting to think that the people who think this place is 5-star worthy just don't venture outside big restaurant chains that often. Chelsea's must seem like nirvana to someone who is used to Applebees, but there are SO many better places in town!  This last visit finally caused me to put the place on my shun list and prompted this review.  We went during the lunch rush - not their fault - which meant we had to valet (\"free\"...sure). But the hostess was nowhere to be found when I walked in and they clearly needed more than one person working the front for a little while during the big rush (hello? manager?) She eventually took my name but did not write down the number in my party. My friend got there and walked in to inquire as to the wait time. No big deal, 10 more minutes. Twenty minutes later, as we were melting away waiting on the patio, she went back inside to inquire again. The hostess was surprised to see her. She had forgotten we were out there. She sat us at one of the 7 tables that had come available while we waited.  Then the servers couldn't figure out whose table it was, so two people came to take our drink order. Again, not deadly, but still annoying after the hostess experience. Once they figured it out the service smoothly enough. I was a little annoyed that my club soda came in individually priced little bottles. had I remembered that I would have just ordered water. Right around the time our drinks came and the server went to take our order I realized how loud the place was. She was literally shouting so that we could hear her describe the specials.  This whole visit could have probably been saved with awesome food. But once again the food was just, meh. I ordered the Crispy Chicken Spinach Salad. The chicken was flabby and greasy, but not crispy. Most of the fried part actually fell off in peels of fat when they sliced the chicken. I tried to save a couple pieces, but the coating was so tough that I ended up just stripping off what hadn't fallen off on its own. The rest of the salad was pretty good, maybe a little overdressed.  My friend ordered the Howie Burger which she pronounced \"Good, but you can't screw up a burger.\" I beg to differ, considering the Vig manages to do it every time, but she seemed happy enough to eat the whole thing so that's something. The fries were seasoned with what tasted like the seasoning on BBQ chips and were a little tough. I don't like sweet seasonings on fries and this spice blend tasted like it had quite a bit of sugar in it. Maybe that's a personal preference, I thought it was weird.  Previous recent failures included: Fish tacos - good fish but way too much of the melon salad on top and soggy tortillas Brussel sprout salad - again, could have been great, but overdressed and soggy and skimpy on the other ingredients Green Chile Burger - ordered medium...came out dry, heavy, and grey  Monica is still one of the loveliest bartenders in town, so I may get suckered into happy hour once in a while, but will stick to drinks for the remainder of the visits to this place.",

    "text": "First time coming here I drove into the parking lot with what looks like more than half of the parking lot filled with cones for valet parking. The parking lot doesn't look like it would be difficult to get to the front door - so in a sense seemed a little pointless. I found a shaded parking luckily.   Patio seating was available. Walked in and was immediately greeted. First couple impressions was that it smells good and that the ambience was trendy and fun! The place looked pretty packed and I can tell I already want to come back for a second visit.  I was deciding on their huevos rancheros, the chiliquiles, or their brunch special: baked egg and green chilies. The server suggested the chiliquiles for $14, and boy am I glad I got that!! It's chicken and hard fried egg topped with pico de gallo and a red and green sauce. OMG!! Delicious!! Ate every single bite. And then enjoyed a couple mugs full of French press for $3. Maybe more than one is not suggested because I became jittery.   The whole time I was a bit hot. At first I thought it was the tiny spiciness of the food but I guess the ac wasn't turned down enough or something. The women's bathroom has 3 stalls and the first one was doorless!!! How?!?! Kinda weird for a place that has valet parking.   Overall I enjoyed my experience there and would come back for the food and ambience!!",

Service is also on par.   Friendly and prompt.   What more cud you want.   Service tonight was with Janel.   She was great!    Our food came out quickly and was hot and cooked just as we ordered.   The rib eye tacos were amazing.   They serve with fresh made corn tortillas,  pico de gallo, guacamole and a very tasty kale quinoa salad.    Thank you to Chelsea Kitchen for another great meal !",

    "text": "A gluten free friendly gem...especially offseason!   Received such a warm welcome as we entered into the restaurant through their front misted patio with lush greenery. This is a beautiful oasis in the desert city.   Our server, Emily, was a friendly and attentive problem solver as we asked a battalion of questions about gluten free options and cocktail recommendations. On a warm night, her sparking rose was a perfect recommendation. The slight sweeetness and bubbles worked well with their gluten free cornbread. The yummy green chile cornbread was moist and served warm in a cast iron dish. It is soft and crumbly on the inside with a crunchy sweet crust.   For dinner our table ordered rotisserie chicken, caesar salad with grilled salmon, and the special (halibut). All our dishes were served at the perfect temperatures. The portion sizes were enough to make us not want dessert. The food tasted as previous reviewers touted. Nothing over spiced...food perfectly balanced. Emily was super informative on their gluten free options and there are many to choose from.   With regards to their gluten friendliness, they have the ability to mark all food allergies on your food order to alert the chef and kitchen of your specific needs. Emily was a great partner to make sure my food was as good as it was safe. I really appreciate the additional measures they take.  Their serving system makes use of various people to assist you in your dining experience which, at first, seems a bit chaotic. However, their communication system (handheld devices) made sure nothing was duplicated or missed. Surely something to see! Dining in the 21st Century! We will be back...and next time we cannot wait to check out their beautifully lit fireplace patio. It looked so romantic!",

The place is able to mix some figurative water and oil - water being chillness and oil being professionalism - and make it into a wonderful experience.   I am not sure how long this place has been around, but I think it can eventually corner the market for exquisite breakfast, brunch, or lunch eateries.   Can't speak for dinner cause I didn't dine for dinner.  They offer the Bottomless Mimosa deal, but don't give you light fizzle champagne with lukewarm orange juice. They give you the ice cold Miller Lite commercial deal, combined with a freshly popped Mexican Coke bottle type carbonation. Honestly, need I say more how great this place is?  But I got to. Food is the bomb . com. I ordered the spread of a man who could only watch the food channel and dream of eating where Anthony B ate. I assure you that whatever you get will satisfy your palate and stomach.   One slight drawback that almost made me give the place four stars, and that is the parking situation. Get there early. You are probably thinking early means I can leave 30 minutes later than when I planned to. Nah fam, get here early. Probably like 60 parking spots total for a place that will attract that many in its first hour.  My friends and I had a splendid time here. I wish I had gone here more to be honest. Chelsea's is a place to make memories.",

The seafood in the salad reminded me of being home in Seattle, on my own boat, eating fresh crab, that's how good it was!  It also had a pleasant after heat in the dressing that caught me by surprise after I devoured the salad.

The first time I went the only vegan options on their menu were a stripped down salad and a very light watermelon soup. It was good, but I was still hungry. They have some other menu options that can be made vegan. The veggie tacos can be made vegan - subtract the cheese and the kale slaw. The veg burger is vegan if served on lettuce - subtract the bun, which probably has dairy. The wait staff assured me that the bread crumbs in the burger are vegan. I have no problem with the prices of the food, unless I have to subtract parts of the meal and then pay for additional sides to make up for it because I am still hungry. Since my husband feels the same about the food, it is definitely not a date-night spot for us. So I will only go here if someone else, a meat eater, really wants to and I enjoy their company (and I've had a snack before arriving).",

The back yard setting in this Arcadia restaurant is seemingly perfect all year round, with their giant oaks (?) for shade during the sunny months, and a large, wood-burning, brick chiminea for those ten-or-so cold days of the year.  The outside is outrageously cozy.  And when you're back here, it doesn't really matter all that much how *good* the food is.  Oh, please believe, its pretty damn good and cooked very well, but in this setting, a Betty Crocker Mug-o-Lunch would taste like a Thomas Keller creation.  I've spent birthdays and NYE and Friday night, pre-festivities dinners here and each has been unique with varying menus ... something I've always appreciated; progressive restaurants who employ confident chefs willing to expand their craft without alienating their core patrons.    I won't recommend a dish.  Its all good.  The desserts are charming too [read: the sundae].  What I am recommending to you is the setting.  You can't go awry.",

The atmosphere is nice enough, although the space is so massive that it has that subtle, distinct overpriced-cafeteria flavor that LGO seems to have mastered.   I ordered a 12 dollar \"Santa Fe green chile burger\", which the menu describes as having the following ingredients: \"wood-fired poblano chile, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheddar cheese & chipotle aoli.\" Sounds glorious, doesn't it? Unfortunately, all that glory basically amounts to what looked and tasted to me like a plain hamburger with a slice of Velveeta slopped on top in between two buns. Nowhere did I detect a hint of the famed \"wood-fired poblano chile\". I confess that I don't actually know what \"chipotle aoli\" is, so I can't tell you if there was any on the burger. Maybe \"chipotle aoli\" is like carbon monoxide: you can't smell, taste, see or otherwise detect it?",

Totally kool and definitely my cup of tea.  Oh, and the food was pretty good too... actually, I've been to Chelsea's a handful of times, and I've enjoyed the food and ambiance on each occasion.    You can't go wrong with the rotisserie chicken but tonight I went with the steak tacos and shared the swordfish tacos with Colleen C from Chicago Yelp.  No drinks for me as I was DD tonight - yes, I let the girls have their fun!    Tunes, grub, and ambiance make this place a 'go-to' whether you sit inside or out...",

If you're kidless, the patio is a great place for date night. For Apps, guacamole and deviled eggs are great. For entrees the short rib tacos are my favorite by far and my friends always rave about the ahi tuna tacos. My husband also get the lobster tacos every time! The service is also pretty good. They're attentive and quick once you get sat. They don't take small party reservation so expect to wait. I've always had to wait no matter what day I go. It's also a bit pricey so prepare for a $100+ check if you tend to order all the bells and whistles and/or have 4+ people.",

The design of the restaurant really is gorgeous, light wood tables, copper and stone.  It is a bit loud, but was great as we had a baby in tow.  The food is a bit over priced, the $12 burger was delicious but wasn't a $12 portion.  I would guess rent and snootiness are expensive where they're at and the Ferrari drivers don't seem to mind.  I would like to go back and get the roasted chicken dinner.  We had Guac to start which was excellent and fresh.  You can get out of here with your wallet if you don't drink, but what fun is that?",

I enjoy that you won't find a Budweiser or Coors here (don't hate... I love my Bud Light poolside as much as the next red-blooded Arizona asshole, but it's a nice touch to expose those who might otherwise be unwilling to something new and delicious. Case in point: my father, a republican, Nascar-watching Miller Lite drinker, loves to have a Stella while he's here. That's saying something.). The food is wonderfully and artfully prepared, and my otherwise simple male companions always find new favorites here.   The menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering (the spit-roasted prime rib, dixie pan-fried chicken), but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas, but insists she's in Arcadia (Arcadia Featured salad, Vegetarian Nut Burger).  This could be why my Chelsea's is the only place my kooky family can agree upon.",

    "text": "I own a business in south Scottsdale and being a foodie, I am always very concerned about people's dining experiences, especially if they are from out of town. I am a self-appointed concierge! lol.. but seriously... nothing worse than getting sent to a crappy restaurant.  So, there area a # of restaurants that I just love. To me, a restaurant is good if 1/ the food is good and 2/ the food is good all the time. And I want atmosphere. Oh, and a hot server wouldn't hurt either. Ha!  Well, that last is a wish but ... anyhow, I love Chelseas.  I have never gone there and had a bad experience.  The food is consistently good.  I think too it is a good sign when you walk in a restaurant and the air is just redolent with heavenly cooking smells.  I always get the same thing n foodwise there  but it is always tasty.. the fish tacos.  They have a wide array of types of tacos you can get and there are actually two types of fish tacos.. ahi tuna and swordfish.  They are deconstructed.. meaning.. you put them together yourself.  My favorite is the swordfish.. yummy!  The only weird thing that I have seen is that lately, they have done away with the beans and rice side and replaced it with a kale salad.  I am like.. what??? How is kale Mexican?  But you can request the beans and rice.  The other thing that is funny are the small baby tacos.  I guess that is the trend but they crack me up. Literally, my wine glass was bigger.   Other items that friends have gotten that I would recommend are the short ribs with poached egg and the roasted chicken.  One last thing:  I can never make it out of there without taking a cookie (or two!) from the dessert plate by the door.  What a nice touch!  And they are soo tasty.. soft chocolate chip with sea salt on top.  BTW.. the sea salt is inspired!   So.. go there. And the plus is that they do have some hot waiters!",

We had Caesar salads to start, he had the pork tacos, I had the grilled salmon for dinner, and for dessert he had the key lime pie, while I tried the chocolate pave.  Everything was delicious! The chocolate pave I took home with me and it took a couple nights to finish it was so rich! So good though.",

It isn't fine dining, but the food is good and I'm always in a good mood as I walk up to the front door of this establishment. The service is always friendly, from the host at the door to every server or bartender I have ever dealt with there.   I love the bar, whether I'm sitting on the inside or outside sections. If the weather is good, the patio tables are SO worth the wait. Last weekend, after a long morning run, Chelsea's Kitchen was our reward. As we sat, drinking our beers, we planned a future backyard filled with mesquite trees that provided a natural canopy of shade. Seriously, I could have sat there and drank all day. Come to think of it, I don't know why we didn't.   Food-wise, I am a huge fan of the rib-eye tacos. Their burgers are are excellent, as well. You're not going to see a James Beard award associated with Chelsea's Kitchen. It's not that kind of place. The food is good and simple. The ambiance is casual and fun; nice enough for a business dinner, and casual enough for lunch with friends. I've never walked out of there anything but happy and will return again and again.",

It's juicy, it melts in your mouth, and it's found only at Chelsea's Kitchen!  ...then there's that thing about putting a fried egg on top of it.

I really liked these tacos because they gave you the meat, a kale and quinoa salad with grapes (yum), pico, and guacamole all on a plate and the tortillas separately so you could build your taco. The tortillas were pretty small but it didn't matter cause the flavor was there and they were so so good.   We ended with the pecan pie and red velvet cake and they were just as good. The red velvet was surrounded with cream cheese frosting and it was heaven.   I will be coming back!",

There are artists back there in the open kitchen creating masterpieces.  I had the \"award winning\" short rib tacos.   I wanna give them an award!!!' My wife, on doctor's orders has to go vegan .  She had the vegetarian tacos.  Wonderful.  I even liked the kale salad side dish.  I'm a guy!  Our waiter, James, made the best recommendations.  I give my highest recommendations.  Eat here and if you don't like it dinner is on me.......  not really but I'm confident that you'll love this place.",

But the inside restaurant was cute too. I would've loved bottomless mimosas but $15 bottles weren't bad either. The food was delicious. I got the chilaquiles which was super tasty. I liked that it had both red and green sauce. It looked small but it was a lot and it was filling. My friend got the short rib hash. There were hardly any potatoes, onions, or anything other than meat but it was delish so she wasn't mad about it. We also got a side of bacon which was heaven on earth! The service was good, we never waited long for anything. I'm definitely coming back!",

We were shocked that his happened as we were mentally preparing for at least a long minute wait.   Bonus   Tasted the salted caramel cookies. Give those a big miss. Way to much salt on top. It was if I just gnawed on a salt lick. Can't warn you enough to avoid these cookies ........ yuck. So much potential so sad      Salt seems to be an issue here. Ordered the Dixie style chicken which is so moist   The potatoes on the first couple of bites were absolutely delicious as I ate more the clawing taste of to much salt was there   Chefs please east up in the salt.  Distracts from the meal.  My companion agreed with the to much salt in the spuds   The broccoli pastry thing that came wii the meal was so greasy   I had to ask the server \"what is this ?\"  Mystery pastry  The broccolini with fresh mandarin on it was a hit.   The short rib tacos were pretty good. Larger chunks of meat than expected to go on a very small taco. The kale and quinoa salad was better than it sounded   The noise level was extreme.  No sweet romantic conversation here   Al conversations were a yell  Overall pretty good meal. The enthusiasm with the salt detracted from the overall taste experience",

First of all, the ambiance is great, we waited for a table on the patio, and it was perfect. Service was also great, sorry I don't remember our servers name, but she was very good.  I ordered a salad, and went for the brussel sprouts one. It was a work out for my mouth, very chewy, and not as yummy as I expected. It did have cranberry and nuts in it as well, but wasn't really that tasty. Sorry Chelsea, but not sure that is a salad worthy dish. My table partners did enjoy their dinners, so I guess it was just me. We will always be back. Can't resist your cookies by the door!",

It wasn't very busy (no doubt due to the fact it was pouring with rain and the streets were fast becoming rivers), the fire was going and it had a wonderful atmosphere. The decor was homely, yet sophisticated. The service was friendly and efficient without being too phony. The food was delicious - especially the crab cake Benedict and the Santa Fe eggs. We couldn't resist a slice of the key lime pie after our hard work hiking that morning. It was very light and fluffy and served with homemade strawberry gelato.  If I ever come back to Phoenix, I will definitely make another visit to Chelsea's Kitchen.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Chelsea's when I read on it here on Yelp but unfortunately maybe my hopes were too high. It was a long drive to Scottsdale to experience Chelsea's and upon arrival I was impressed with the appearance of the place. I was quickly seated and was given a menu. That menu however had coffee all over it.??? I asked for and received another menu and notice that my companion also had coffee all over her menu.???   I had some of the LGO English Muffins and they were quite good. They're not your grocery store variety of English Muffin that you usually get at so many places in that they were larger than standard. Not the Wolferman's(look it up) size of EM but larger than grocery store variety. What was special about it is the whipped butter with a bit of orange marmalade in it. Very good. A suggestion would be a butter knife served with the Muffins instead of the cutting knife that adorns the settings.  I ordered some coffee and was pleasantly surprised to be served French pressed coffee. What a nice touch.  I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict as that's what really caught my eye on the online menu. The CCB is billed as having Jumbo Lump Crab in it, however, what wasn't mentioned is that it was \"pan fried\". The result, IMO, was a greasy patty of something that could have easily been Pollock and who would have known. Maybe my taste buds were all ready for something else, like freshly steamed crab meat or just plain steamed crab meat. Oh well, my server Kim was great about everything and graciously comped the dish since the main selling point came well short of the mark.  A side note that needs to be mentioned is the issue of dead insects on the window screens and sills. This is not very appetizing if you sit near the windows and at least they were contained in the dead space( no pun intended) between the window and inside screen. I was assured that it is an issue that the management is addressing but all you should have to do is vacuum the screens and sills prior to opening for the day. I was there early enough that this shouldn't have been an issue yet it was.   My dining companion had a French Dip plate that she liked. The Fries served with it were very good as well.",

The combo of top notch service, delicious food and a fab atmosphere has made me an official fan of this place. I love that they send text messages to alert the customer when the table is ready!  We started with an order of the shrimp ceviche to share. We were hungry, so the portion was perfect for two to share. All the traditional ceviche flavors made it into this dish, but the jicama was a delicious and crisp addition to the dish. Yum!  My friend opted to order off of the Restaurant Week menu, which was 3 courses for $30.00, and of course I had to have a tasted of each item! Chris started off with the Caesar Salad, which was perfectly dressed. For this entree, he ordered the Short Ribs served with a side of delectable mashed potatoes and some sort of root vegetable. Did I mention the short ribs were topped with an egg? (I think it was over-easy). I've never had an egg with short ribs....and it was the best decision Chris ever made! Red Velvet cake came for dessert. The cream cheese frosting was nothing short of perfection.   I ordered the grilled salmon for dinner. Some might say that was a boring choice, but I was in the mood for something simple. My choice certainly hit the spot! The salmon was grilled to perfection (medium rare), served with some fingerling potatoes and green beans. The green beans were a little to crunchy and a little charred for my taste, but still enjoyable.  Our server Alyson, who was pleasant and on-point all night deserves a shout-out. Thanks Alyson!  I will definitely return to Chelsea's Kitchen.  Thanks Gabi M. for the suggestion!",

    "text": "Phenomenal food!!  I wanted to try this place because I saw reviews for the short rib tacos.  Short ribs are one of my favorite dishes so I had to try them. I went with my husband, my mother and two daughters (3 and 5) this past Sunday night. I had read some mixed reviews about the dishes not being worth the price and the short ribs being too expensive.  PEOPLE THEY SERVE GRASS FED BEEF!!!  Grass fed is always more expensive (not to mention healthier for you).  Short ribs in general are always expensive.  If you want GMO corn fed beef filled with steroids and antibiotics then go somewhere else. You will probably still pay the same price for short ribs and only save a couple dollars on the burger.   My husband and I both got the short rib tacos and neither one of us could finish our meal.  The kale slaw was amazing and I'm not a slaw fan or a raw kale fan.  This kale slaw had quinoa, shredded parmesan and a delicious light dressing on it. Even my three year old enjoyed it. My mom thought her burger was delicious and so were the seasoned fries. My kids loved the homemade mac n cheese.  My kids and I are gluten intolerant and our server was very sensitive to our needs. The kids received gluten free pasta and the server assured me my ribs were also gluten free, served with warm, corn tortillas. I really enjoyed my leftover tacos the next day for lunch with fries.  I will definitely be coming back here again and it was definitely worth the price!!!!    I read some reviews about bad service but we did not experience that.  The place was packed when we walked in and our server was very attentive to us. The only thing that took a while was getting some ketchup but other than that the service was great! The servers have iPads to take orders so that your order is immediately sent to the kitchen before the server leaves the table.  The food came quick for how packed this place was.  I also liked that wicky sticks were given to my kids when we sat down. They love playing with those and I usually keep them in my purse for restaurant visits. It was nice that I didn't have to pull out my own stash. Overall this was a great experience and I can't wait to come back and try out the patio seating.",

Anyone can enjoy these whether carnivore or herbivore. I would recommend substituting the kale salad with cannelloni beans but the salad is also great. The kale could have been massaged a tad more but it was still enjoyable. Service is good and ambiance is too, however, the lights are dimmed--a little too much--sometime around 7.

    "text": "I will say that the food and the wine I had were amazing.  However, the service was AWFUL!  My friend and I came in for the first time on Friday night.  There was a 20-30 minute wait which is to be expected around 7:00 on a weekend.  We walked to the patio area and grabbed a hightop for two.  We were pleasantly surprised that the full menu is served at the cocktail tables.  I asked our server, Kerry M., about the Roth wine.  She told me that it was a great wine and that she often brings a bottle of it home... I asked her to elaborate and tell me what it's like.  The only thing she could tell me was that it was bold (it's a cab... duh it's going to be bold) and asked me a few times if I'd like to try it (obviously because she didn't know what it was like... even though she said she brings it home all the time?).  I decided to just skip the drama and order a glass.  To make it easy on our server, we ordered our appetizer and entree at the same time as our drinks.  We ordered ceviche to start and the rotisserie prime rib for our entree.  After about 15 minutes, with no appetizer, our entree came.  While I was upset that our server forgot to order our appetizer, I didn't want them to send back our entree.  A lot of times when you do that, they save it for you on the line, and then it comes back with dried out potatoes and meat.  So we just kept it.  When we ordered, we asked what side came with the prime rib.  She said it came with the seasonal vegetable (helpful right?).  So then I asked her what the vegetable was.  She said butternut squash.  She could sense our hesitation and asked if we wanted to substitute for mashed potatoes.  When the mashed potatoes came out they had some sort of green mixed it with them, not regular mashed potatoes.  Definitely would not have ordered them if she had featured them with the ingredients.  They also brought out our entree split, with two sides of mashed potatoes (like giant heaps)... and it seemed like an awful lot of food.  The manager later told me it was the normal size, but for $31, I just don't believe it.  I'm tempted to go back and order it for just myself to see if she was lying.  Finally we get to dessert.  We decided to order the red velvet cake, which comes with there vanilla gelato.  We noticed on the menu that the strawberry gelato is vegan (and therefore dairy free).  So when we ordered dessert, I told our server specifically that my friend was not good with dairy and asked if we could substitute the strawberry gelato.  She said yes and brought it out... However... she did not tell us that the Red Velvet cake doesn't just have cream cheese frosting on the outside of the cake, it is also layered in... Would have been nice to know when you specifically told her your friend isn't good with dairy right?  We asked to see the manager and she came over promptly.  While we explained all of our frustrations with our meal, she proceeded to argue with me.  She said that the mashed potatoes are featured on the menu with the weird ingredients.  I checked, it just says mashed potatoes.  AND, we ordered something that doesn't normally come with mashed potatoes, so even if it was on the menu, it wouldn't have been listed under the entree we ordered.  She ensured me that our entree was in fact split (TBD...).  Finally, she told me that all cakes are made with dairy, and that basically my friend should have known better?  She said she also suffers from an egg allergy, so she too can't have dairy (what?) and understands my friends problems.  Well, I ate the frosting between the layers so she could have some cake, and it didn't bother her stomach, so there definitely wasn't dairy in it.  After she left our table, she comped our food.  As nice as that was, I came to the restaurant expecting to pay for a nice meal.  I was happy she took care of part of our check, but I was still very frustrated with the service.  Our sever was not knowledgable and the manager continued to say it was just a miscommunication which seemed like she was insinuating it to be my fault.  I've worked in the restaurant industry before.  I worked at Hillstone, which is down the street from Chelsea's.  I don't know if this makes me a bit of a service snob (for those of you who've dined there, I'm sure you understand), but verbiage is key.  Our server was noticeably upset when we left, but I'm sure happy when she saw the $40 tip she received on our $77 (before the food was comped) bill.    Will I eat there again?  Probably.  But I hate frequenting a place when I have to say \"The food is great, but the service sucks.\"",

    "text": "40 minutes, 125 dollars later. Pathetic.   I love to eat out. I am a total foodie and because of that, I've eaten at a lot of places in the valley. Good, bad, everywhere in between. I came here with my mom for Mother's Day dinner. Seemed odd that I had never been. Highly rated on yelp, great patio, and I love LGO so this seemed like a perfect choice. Boy was I wrong.   We felt rushed the entire time. From the minute we sat down at our table with the waitress repeatedly asking if we were ready, until the moment we paid our check took 40 minutes. How is that even possible? Forty minutes for three courses on Mother's Day. It's not like I wanted to spend time with my mom or anything. Our appetizer came out with our soup and our entrees. For entrees priced at over twenty dollars I would rather not be rushed through my meal. I felt like I was at Applebee's.   The food was mediocre, especially for the price. We got a variety of things off the menu including the short rib tacos and pan fried chicken. Both lacked seasoning and I felt like I could have made them at home.   Great ambience especially on a nice day, but if I'm going to pay 20+ an entree I expect better service (or any service at all) and better food. Highly disappointed. The only reason this place got two stars instead of one was the free chocolate chip cookies at the front on your way out.",

I told the waitress and she offered to get me something else so I ordered the short ribs tacos that so many Yelp users were hyped up about. The tacos were okay, but nothing special... paid $20 for the tacos and $2.50 for the soda.   Overall, friendly staff and decent environment but better chefs are needed especially at these prices...",

I won't get into too much detail about what we ordered but I would recommend the prime rib.  Our server here I forget her name was great.  She was very pleasant and since we told her we were out of town and wanted to visit the downtown Phoenix area she gave us some tips on where to head to.    Nothing beats having brunch sipping on a bloody mary and some wine w/ prime rib people watching.  The crowd here does seem decently well off and I saw a few beautiful women.  I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely return if I was ever back in the area.  Patio seating for the people watching.",

We walked by the open bar to see if we wanted anything to drink while we were waiting.  By the time we walked by to the entrance, they were ready to seat us (it was definitely less than 15 minutes). The place is dimly lit and it has a very casual but a nicer atmosphere.   Our waitress was very nice and asked us if we had questions regarding the menu. The wait staff is very responsive and attentive.  We ordered the chips and dip (guac and salsa) as an appetizer. The guac wasn't anything special in particular but it was good. It tasted like fresh guac made from fresh ingredients. The salsa was good, it was a chipotle salsa, nice and spicy - good kick to it!  I ordered the Howie burger with the kale slaw. I definitely like the kale slaw, I RECOMMEND it. I am a big kale and quinoa fan, I make my own. I really like the grapes and sunflower seeds to it, it gives a slight sweetness and crunch to the salad. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The cheese was melted and the onions a sweet and nice texture to it. I enjoyed it a lot.  I would definitely recommend trying this place. Try their kale slaw!  (Today [7/4] they had the buy one entree, get the other entree for $4 ---greatt deal!)",

They have a very nice patio which is great for beautiful days like today  Cons: Valet parking....really unnecessary Their soup of the day was not very good...a pork posole... it did not have a ton of flavor and was not hearty enough...

    "text": "Despite having heard wonderful things about Chelsea's Kitchen, I've never made it in to dine here before until last night.  I don't know why I waited so long, but I wish I had come sooner.  Aside from being easy to find, Chelsea's has a low key look from the outside, but easy to find and spot from the road.  Upon pulling up, I realized that they had complimentary valet.  Nice!  Place is wonderfully decorated without coming off as intimidating, and has a great clean, sophisticated look yet still makes you feel comfortable eating there.  I like that.   I was greeted right when I went in and was waiting for my friend Robin and her mom to arrive.  I waited outside and realized that there's a table for 8 people right outside the front door! I hung out there until Robin and her mom arrived.  When we were seated, staff was warm, friendly and attentive.  Hostess made sure we were comfortable where we sat and the server was right on it the whole night through.  Since I had never been there before, I had a few questions about the menu, and in between the server and my friend, they were able to answer everything for me.  I went with the Chelsea's Cheeseburger minus the Russian Dressing.  Friends mom went with the Wood fired chicken quarter, and Robin went with the Ahi Tuna.  When the food came out, it all looked really nice! Burger was awesome, and the fries were sweet potato (i think) and were excellent.    While we were eating, the guys at the table next to us ordered a steak of some sort, and it was HUGE, and looked absolutely delicous. If I hadn't already eaten, I very well could have gone over there and taken the plate away from the poor guy it looked so good.  I didn't get a chance to see it, but I heard that the patio is beautiful. I was going to go look, but I was so engrossed in my dinner and conversation, that I never got to check it out. Next time I will though.  I would like to say that I wish I had come here sooner. This is my kind of dining establishment, and its absolutely worth every penny you spend here, and worth every mile you drive.",

I came in to celebrate a milestone achievement for a friend of mine and we were treated to a PHEEEEEEENOMENAL feast!  We started off with the prime rib and short rib but ended up getting the chicken, mashed potatoes, deserts basically as much as we could handle to ensure that we were uncomfortable.  The managers stopped in to make sure our experience was top notch and everything from the ambience to the seating selection exceeded all expectations.  Our server Matt was on point and super friendly ensuring that we were comfortable but these times call for eating like a fat kid and laughing to drinks and good company.  I will be back!!!",

I'm a little bummed that I didn't order the side of mac n cheese, but I will definitely be back to try it.

We got there on a Friday evening without reservations about 8 pm.  Fortunately they had a table open up right away.  We had a great experience.  We both had  the Watermelon Gazpacho Soup.   I had the Brussels Sprout Salad (bacon, almonds, manchego cheese) And my friend had The Del Mar Salad (shrimp, crab meat, iceberg, avacado, olives).  The salads were so huge and filling and delicious.  We enjoyed our meal and our time together so much that the next night I decided we should go back.  We did and the same server was there and was so sweet.  She remembered us even with all the many customers she serves.  It was just as great the second time.  Love Love Love Chelsea's Kitchen!",

Since moving here from that \"coastal state next door\" Phoenicians probably do not want to hear [from me] that they are not invested in the great weather here and as outdoor-oriented as they should be. It also does'nthurt that both the food and the clientele here is just the best! ....a great place to meet friends for happy hour or take a client. Everything I have had here is first-rate. The mac-and -cheese appetizer is comfort food nirvana, the lobster bisque is the best I have had, bruch is relaxed with a choice of everything from pancakes, chiliquiles, to burgers....something for everyone. My husband had the short rib tacos and was unable to finish everything.....lean meat, home made tortillas. They were excellent. I had the huevos rancheros, and the red chili sauce had just the right amount of spice and smokiness. Have I mentioned their wait staff is attentive and friendly? If it gets any better at Chelsea's, I will happily come back and give them a 5th star!",

    "text": "As a seasonal resident of AZ, this is the very first restaurant that was so poor that I felt compelled to comment on.     Well I thought I'd give CK another try after 2 disappointing visits. So for a late bite we arrived around 9:30 pm, the place was dead, staff talking amongst themselves, smelled great and asked to sit on the patio. The Hostess tried to sit us where it would be convenient for the server, but we chose a more intimate area and got a vibe like we might be asking for something out of the ordinary. We were coldly greeted by our server, who looked similar to every other server, young, averagely attractive, no visible outstanding qualities. Yes, I work in a seasonal food service business and hire and fire these clones daily. Anyway, this is our mediocre apathetic workforce of today. We received our wine and I noticed my wine glass was dirty or smudged. I decided to just let it go, but as I thought about it and the level of detail I require in my own business, I decided to ask for a new glass, but only once our food had arrived, fearing kitchen reprisal. The server brought our food, and I asked for the new glass, pointing out the smudge, which she immediately snatched up the glass, noted the smudge and left the table without one word. Now onto the food, well where do I begin, poor plate presentation even for a $12 veggie burger, very anemic like the server. Oh, no utensils or napkins or even an offer of water. I waited a few minutes and decided to get my own utensils, which were neatly wrapped in a napkin by the patio door. I turned the bun onto the veggie patty and it is cold and I decide I will not eat this, it is beneath me and how can someone serve something so pathetic and get away with it. When the server checked on us, I told her I wasn't happy and explained that I thought the bun should be toasted and her attitude was its not our policy to toast the bun and I should specify how I want my bun. With this I asked for a credit to my bill and she took the plate, turned and curtly walked away. Once again, no apology or attempt to rectify the complaint, only a confrontation that I the one paying her salary was some how responsible. We left with no parting adieu, never to return. We drove to their sister venue, Postino, which for the second time we had a great experience. Staff were personable, professional and uncloned. As for CK, go if you like camouflaged mediocrity, enjoy being snubbed by the people who are suppose to serve you and paying for it. I'll take mine at the S&M.",

    "text": "Just got back from Chelsea's Kitchen with my boyfriend on a nice Sunday afternoon early dinner. I heard about this place a few times from friends and decided we should go check it out. When we walked in the restaurant smelt tres good! We decided to sit outside - great choice there was a big fireplace and lots of heat lamps which I sat right underneath.  We asked the waitress what they had for happy hour (everyday 4-6) it was around 5. She recited the drinks but we had no idea what she was talking about when she said the food part of the happy hour. I understood nachos and we got that (minus the chicken, im a veg head) Those were good, they say it is a smaller portion of the Chicken Nachitos on the menu ($13) they were $8 (for happy hour) and pretty good, good portion of guacamole on top and we both enjoyed them. My bf got a beer (happy hr - $2.50) and I got the white sangria (happy hr it was half off $3.50) - pretty good, needs more fruit. However, I saw a table order the pitcher and we regretted not doing that (tons of fruit and super big pitcher!). My bf ordered Chelsea's Cheeseburger with fries. It was a big portion but he didn't care too much for it. It was $12. I had a bit of trouble finding something to order - all the salads had meat in them! I ordered the Brussels Sprout Salad and got avocados instead of the smoked bacon. Overpriced for a salad - $13 not that big - medium sized. It was good overall but nothing exceptional. Overall the restaurant was really good for the outdoor seating. Probably won't go back since there are soooo many great restaurants in PHX/scottsdale.",

One key criteria for a good dining experience - does it put you in a good mood once you step in? The answer re Chelsea's is a resounding Yes. They've done a wonderful job with the layout from the entrance patio to the fresh air indoor dining area to the indoor/outdoor bar that rolls out to the outdoor dining area for a Southwest feel with a fireplace. How about the food?- ribs, salads, burgers and especially the fish taco's are highlights. I've been a dozen times - for a number of events - drinks/appetizers, business, friends/family. Great people watching and terrific energy. This is one from the LGO family of restaurants.  A real winner.",

The managers Chris and Matt, and our server Lilly, made our visit the most pleasant and memorable we have had for a long time. We felt very welcome and special from the start, when we were seated at a wonderful table, to the finish, when Chris packaged some of those wonderful sea salt chocolate cookies to take home with us.We  seemed to never be without someone refilling our water or wine glasses, or suggesting something new try.     The service aside, I was impressed by the prices of everything, very reasonable, nothing over $20 on the brunch menu except for a few specialty beef items, most everything mid $10s. I was equally impressed by the wine selection and prices, it being Sunday Brunch we settled on a Bottle of Prosecca which they had for only $28, what a steal, and it was fabulous. I even wrote it down so I could buy it myself later.  The food equaled the service, it was all absolutely marvelous.  We had the Deviled Eggs for an appetizer, we order the small serving which was our mistake because they were so good we ended up ordering another.   Then for Brunch amongst us,  we ordered the French Omelet, the Day Break Omelet and the Brussel Sprout Salad. They all went perfectly well with the Prosecca. I had the French Omelet and  it was the best Omelet I have had in a long time. First it was huge, second it was perfectly cooked, the eggs were light and fluffy, third, it was filled with this incredible melted Guyere Cheese and fresh spinach. I tried the Day Break Omelet as well and it was equally as good, and health conscious to boot. I also tried the Brussel Sprout Salad, I had never had anything like it before in my life. The sprouts weren't wilted and soggy like you normally expect, these were green, crisp, perfectly cooked. The crisp srouts coupled with the saltiness of the bacon and the sharpness of the long shavings of Manchego cheese made it a perfectly balanced salad with tons of flavor and textures. I will definately order it again the next time we visit.   For desert, we had the French Press coffee which is always a favorite of ours when its available, and it was wonderful here. We tried to pass on desert, in an attempt at being good, but then Chris convinced us to try the seasonal Pumpkin Pie, evidently it is only available this month, THANKS CHRIS!!!!, it was the best Pumpkin Pie I had ever had, truly, you should go this month and try it before it is gone. I can tell you we will go back for it, and all the rest of the increadible food and service at  Chelsea's Kitchen, you can't go wrong there, we highly recommend it, its a new favorite place to go.",

For dessert we had key lime pie with strawberry sherbet and pistachio and chocolate mint gelato.  This was a wonderful evening and even better because of our server Simone.

I HIGHLY suggest getting the baked mac and cheese with chilies and jalapenos. Unreal. It is off the menu but they still will go out of their way to create this dish. The mac and cheese is also paired well with the pitcher of white sangria. It is so delicious I could drink the whole thing myself; I didn't, but I could. As a vegetarian I feel that I had plenty of options to choose from off the menu. I got the vegetarian tacos. AMAZING. Portions are generous and I have seconds for tomorrow. The only downfall is that they don't take reservations.  But the food is so good, it honestly worth the wait.",

The ambiance was great from the canal, the twinkle lights in the trees and the noise level. Our server was highly informative and offered perfect recommendations. Everyone could not stop talking about their food and we were even talking about it over breakfast this morning.   We took Uber so I cannot comment on the parking but the lot was packed. I would definitely recommend and only knocking off one star for the lack of craft beer support.",

The manager was quick to act after I asked to have him \"replaced\" in not necessarily the politest of ways.  It seems they are willing to go above and beyond...when asked.  Short rib tacos (I know it sounds odd) are delicious...as are the accoutrements.  Good cognac is a rarity and Chelsea's stocked some labels I hadn't even heard of.

On her last visit, she had the brussel sprout salad and raved about it.   For desert, we had the red velvet cake. It was the best I ever tasted.

Since when are toddlers allowed at a bar?!? After finally getting a drink and being seated we ordered an appetizer and a bottle of wine. About 5 minutes later the server took our dinner order and in the meantime the appetizer came out.  At this point we still didn't have the bottle of wine we ordered. We then got our entrees but still no wine. I ordered the halibut which was cooked to a crisp so I had to send it back. Finally the wine arrives!  My entree was then brought back out about 8 min later by the chef. He apologized and acknowledged the first one was over cooked. If I dine here again it will likely only be for a few drinks and an appetizer with low expectations.",

I typically start with the guacamole or Brussels sprout salad, followed by the prime rib or surf and turf tacos, accompanied by the white sangria, and I love to grab a complimentary salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out. In addition, the servers are always outstanding, attentive but absent and friendly, without overwhelming. You will wait about 35-45 minutes for a prime time on a weekend evening, but in my opinion, it's absolutely worth it. You are also limited to valet only on busy nights but it's free with the exception of a tip. I only have two hesitations, the first being that the host staff are just okay. Usually, I find that the hostesses are artificially upbeat and slightly condescending, but not specifically rude. The second being that they don't take reservations, with the exception of large parties. That being said, those issues are minor and I will be returning often!",

Both the interior of the restaurant and the patio have elegant, modern decor. I was impressed down to the thought-out ceiling of the bathroom! The hostess was incredibly friendly and pointed out exactly where the person was that we were meeting. A very nice gesture, she seemed to know we hadn't met him before :) The bar is an indoor/outdoor setup, and we ordered a white sangria (YUM!) and a Green Flash IPA (pretty standard, nothing too special). We were seating within 15 minutes. Fantastic wait service, very positive and was at our table the perfect amount of times. Very gracious and gave us suggestions based on what the wait staff like to eat, which if you have worked in the restaurant industry, you know to listen!   We started with the guacamole and salsa. The tomatillo salsa was roasted and had a unique flavor, we really liked it. The guac was just fantastic, very flavorful. We really like garlic in our guac and you could definitely taste it. Even the chips seemed well thought-out, a unique shape and puffy rather than your standard Tostito. They brought us more chips for free. For dinner we split an order of the Seared Ahi Tacos - WOW. Impressive all around. The menu specified that the Ahi was sashimi grade, which we were glad to see. It was perfectly seared and melt-in-your-mouth tender. I wouldn't be surprised if they make the corn tortillas there. They are on the smaller end (so you can eat more tacos, of course) and nicely grilled. They arrived wrapped and warm. The tacos also came with a very unique kale slaw instead of just your standard lettuce, which we absolutely loved. They also came with more guac, roasted salsa, black beans, a creamy sauce that we are used to having with fish tacos, and wedges of lime. They bring the plate to you fajita-style, so you decide what to put on your tacos. We were literally saying \"Oh my god, so good.\" pretty much the entire meal. Wish we could have tried dessert but after splitting an appetizer three ways and an entree two ways, we literally couldn't eat another bite. We had to struggle to finish the tacos.   We were wearing dressy casual clothes (jeans/button up shirt for him, sweater/jeans/boots for her) and felt very appropriately dressed. The prices are in the medium range here, but well worth it. You get exactly what you pay for - very quality food in large quantities! Definitely make a reservation if you are going for dinner - we went on a Wednesday night with a reservation and still waited about 15 minutes. We can definitely see why this place is so popular. We are new to the area and can't wait to take friends and family to Chelsea's Kitchen when they visit!",

When we found out our 16 month old son had severe food allergies we were worried about taking him out to eat.   Last month, we went to Chelsea's kitchen and mentioned our sons allergies to our waitress to see of there was possibly anything he could eat.  Although, I always carry back-up, it's nice a change for him to be able to eat out with his mom and dad.   Within a few minutes, Chef Paul came out to introduce himself.  He wanted to double check about our sons allergies as he doesn't want things to get lost in translation.  He went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable along with making our son a delicious meal. We went back again today, and once again Chef Paul went above and beyond.  Not only did he come out again, but he remembered us and our son and made us feel just as comfortable as he did the first time. Chef Paul should go around and teach other chefs to be as professional and thorough as he is.  We can't say enough about him ... He is beyond phenomenal!",

The wait usually goes by quickly as you are able to get a drink at the bar and then next thing you know, they are summoning you to your table. The last time we were there was for my husband's birthday. There were 5 adults and the total bill was about $250, before the tip.  One of our favorites is the short rib, yummy, yummy. It is so juicy and delicious. We have never taken any home as there are never any leftovers. It does get \"loud\", but I like to call it \"lively\".  We will be back again soon, I hope.",

I don't like to gorge myself, but I like to get a good value when going out to eat. I ordered the braised short rib tacos, which were around $16. The meat was in a big pile and it came with little tortillas, along with some guac, salsa, rice and beans. I made enough tacos to finish all of the tortillas, and was quite full. Then I noticed that I had only used about half of the meat. At about the same time the waitress arrived at the table asking if I wanted more tortillas and a to-go box. I ended up bringing the leftovers to work and it was enough for a full meal, so it ended up being a pretty good value. Everybody was very friendly and helpful. I probably won't go there on a regular basis, because of the prices, but I definitely will be back for a special occasion.",

    "text": "It may have taken fifteen months for my husband and I to make it back over to Chelsea's Kitchen, but it was definitely worth the wait. We brought some friends visiting from Ohio to Chelsea's Saturday night for dinner and all four of us left full and happy. When we arrived, we were told if we wanted to sit on the patio, we could be seated immediately, but for inside there was about a 10 minute wait. We decided to wait and sure enough about ten minutes later we were sat at a table.   We skipped appetizers to save room for dessert after reading the menu. The beer selection is small as a warning. For dinner, our friends had the salmon special and the ribeye tacos. They both enjoyed their meals, although the salmon special was just a piece of salmon and a small spinach salad. No rice or anything else with it. That was a bit disappointing. My husband had the halibut special which came with rice and a vegetable - a much more substantial plate than the salmon special. He really liked his choice. I had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes - yum! The chicken was moist and delicious, and the breading was not over powering or greasy as sometimes it can be with fried chicken. The potatoes could have been a bit more whipped, but they still were amazing. On my previous visit to Chelsea's, I had the caesar salad which was good.   The four of us decided to split two desserts so we had the chocolate destruction (chocolate mousse cake with an oreo crust) and the ice cream sundae. For the sundae, they basically brought you a sundae bar to the table - you get a side of caramel, side of hot fudge, sprinkles, chocolate and peanut butter chips, crushed oreos, and nuts - which I think is a great idea. The chocolate mousse cake was heavenly and I'm so glad we all split it or I would have devoured it myself.  Parking at Chelsea's is complimentary valet. The food is good and when it's a reasonable temperature out, the patio is nice to sit on (we ate on the patio the first time we visited Chelsea's). Definitely a solid restaurant - I just wish we made it over to that area more.",

    "text": "I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story.   I had 7 people.. tried Chelsea's, Postinos, LGO... read below:  My grandparents were in town, and can't really \"wait at the bar\" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told me they couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.  I also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.  I own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it.   Seems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\"",

So yummy, but could definitely have shared it with the husband. Huge portion. My husband had the short rib hash. That was ok. Probably won't order that again. He regrets not ordering the egg Benedict after seeing 8 tables order it. We also had to try the red velvet cake because of you yelpers:). It was very delicious and rich, hah maybe not for breakfast, but had to try it. If you are on a diet this is not for you. Lots of in between cream cheese goodness. ;). Great restaurant!

They have the best shoe string french fries a girl could ask for with some BBQ rub seasoning that leaves you licking your fingers to the very last fry.   When I first started going there I had to try their cheeseburger and I couldn't put the juicy burger down. Now, my obsession is the Brussels Sprout Salad....with maybe a starter of french fries...sorry, it's just too hard! The salad has a great, fresh dressing while still tasting the delicious bite of the Brussels sprout.  The wait staff in the first two years were patient and attentive. Lately, it hasn't been at it's best, but hopefully it will get better in the new year.  My family and friends haunt this place regularly and we have tried everything. I also recommend trying Dr. B.'s Vegetarian Tacos...well because they're good first off and second off it's my best friend's dad. And he definitely deserves to have this meal dedicated to him.    The decor is perfect for us Arcadia kids and parents and disguises the canal well.   Love you Cheslea's Kitchen!!!",

We both had burgers that were really good.  I think they ruined the fries with that BBQ-ish seasoning- I couldn't eat them.  I usually don't complain about this because I usually know what to expect before I go to the restuarant, but I must say I was a little shocked at how expensive this place was.  There were other things I wanted to try but I didn't really wanna pay $26 for tacos.  I'm the farthest thing from a cheap-ass and I really liked this place but I'm not sure if its the place I'd want to go to drop $100+ on dinner and drinks for 2.",

To start, I'd recommend ordering a six count of the tasty little deviled eggs and make sure you opt for the bacon topping.  The two entrees I had were the green chili burger medium rare and the Del Mar salad, hold the olives. The burger was good, but the bun killed it. I just can't fathom why you would make an in house ground burger medium rare and use a low end grocery store bun instead of brioche. Gourmet burger basics!! The salad was a little off as well. A typical similar salad would not have pico all over it, killing the taste of the seafood. Maybe it's not fresh and that's why...I do love fresh pico, but it just didn't work in this dish.  For the same price point, I'm going to Hillstone or Houston's hands down.",

    "text": "Day 1 of our Arizona adventure. After 5 1/2 hour drive and settling in at our hotel it was time for dinner. So my wife looked on Yelp and found Chelsea's Kitchen. Since I was tried of driving, it was nice that Chelsea's was so close to our hotel. 3.8 miles to be exact.   We arrived a little after 7. Chelsea's was busy, but we were able to get seated right away. We wanted to sit outside, but the back patio didn't have misters and I wasn't too thrilled about sweating in my food. lol Our server, Stephanie, promptly greeted us and took our drink order. Since I was thirsty after a long drive, I ordered a Manhattan. My wife ordered a Martini and kiddo ordered pineapple juice.   The menu is short and simple. For starters, I ordered the Deviled Eggs. You have the option of ordering them with bacon. The menu says, \"don't resist\" in reference to bacon on the deviled eggs. Needless to say, I gave in after no arm twisting and ordered bacon with my deviled eggs. The eggs were so flavorful and rich. I believe the were dusted with Paprika which added to their smokey flavor. My daughter ordered the Guacamole and Chips. Yes, very pedestrian, but the best part was the charred tomatillo salsa that accompanied the chips. It had a nice smokey flavor. My wife ordered the Shrimp Ceviche. She said it was just ok. It has more tomato in it than shrimp.  For my main, I ordered the LGO Reserve Short Rib Tacos. This is a dish that Chelsea's is known for. The tacos fixings and the tortillas come separately. You get the short ribs, which I think were cooked in the roasted tomatillo salsa, guacamole, pico de Gallo, and kale slaw. When you combine all those things with homemade tortillas, you get a very beautiful and flavorful taco. To be honest, I think I ate 9 of them. Not kidding. The tortillas are the small street taco size. My wife and daughter shred the Chelsea's Cheeseburger. They said it was good. The fries had a sweetness to them and they weren't sweet potato fries.  The decor of Chelsea's is warm and welcoming. It reminds me a lot of Houston's. The clientele was a good mix of people. Young and old. To be honest, I felt like I was eating at a restaurant in the O.C. lol There is valet parking that is complimentary or you can self park. The parking lot isn't that big so I can only imagine how crazy it gets on w Friday night or on a weekend. No issues with service or staff. The bartender makes Avery smooth Manhattan.",

The fine aroma of smoked meats just lingers in the air as you walk in, a friend had recommended we meet here for brunch. And that smell alone got me prancing around like a little kid anxiously awaiting Christmas presents.   I ordered the short rib hash, something that seemed to be unique to Chelsea's, afraid it was going to be all hash and no short rib. It was the exact opposite. Everything was beautifully balanced, smoky, salty, delicious.   I could have died right after that meal a happy woman. Too bad I don't live in AZ and can't eat this every weekend. Come hell or high water, though, I'll be back again!",

My lady ordered the Howie Burger with the Spaghetti Squash on the side, while I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna tacos & Brussels Sprout Salad.   The energy and ambiance at Chelsea's is friendly and inviting. Iesha, the bartender is a knowledgeable and an enjoyable person to be around. She recommended various dishes and drinks while listing ingredients that made me want one of everything on the menu.   The tuna was so fresh and beautifully cooked. The salad was amazing with perfect texture and so flavorful, I finished everything on my plate.  My girl raved about her burger after every bite.   Cheers to the best bartender Iesha and the amazing kitchen crew.   The next time in Arizona this will be my first stop.",

Our server was very friendly and patient with our large group of not the lowest maintenance girls. We have food allergies, dietary restriction and ice preferences a plethora in our group and she handled them all wonderfully.   Our first appetizer - guacamole and chips was good but the portion was on the smaller size.  Our second appetizer - french fires (large) was LARGE. The fries were delicious and as I stated the kitchen accommodated our preferences and put the diary on the side.   I had the chopped chicken salad special. It was good but the chicken wasn't the best. It was a little hard and not the freshest tasting.   overall though a great experience and do recommend.",

Prior to my visit yesterday, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Yesterday was a different story.  I ordered a Chelsea's Burger, well done. When the burger came to my table the burger was as pink as the palm of my hand. I sent the burger back. The burger came back well done, but had the russian dressing on it, which requested the first time to be taken off of the burger. At this point, I was upset and didn't even bother sending the sandwhich back for a 2nd time. I was even more upset when I received the bill, knowing I paid $50.00 for a disgusting and inaccurate meal. I ordered a white sangria, that tasted like sugar water. Besides, Chelsea's Kitchen screwing up my order back to back, the food was gross.   Chelsea's Kitchen is overpriced and is not worthwhile. The host looked angry when we walked in, didn't smile. The server was nice, but seemed clueless, the manager brought out the food the 2nd time and the order was still wrong. Like, how does an order go through 3 different people and still come out wrong? With so many better restaurant options throughout the valley, I will NEVER go back to Chelsea's Kitchen.",

The ambiance and restaurant itself was very chic and I liked the sophisticated interior. And as soon as we sat down, our server greeted us kindly and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered the smoked Idaho trout dip, guamocole & chips, the real corn bread w green chile and chicken nachitos to start. There were 9 of us so it was a great start especially since we were all starving. The trout dip was kind of like a tuna salad mix that you put on top of a cracker. It was ok... a little fishy for my taste but if you like trout then this is definitely for u. I loved the guacamole and chips! It even came with salsa made fresh. The cornbread was super buttery and absolutely delicious!! And the chicken nachitos was really good as well!   As my main dish, I ordered the carne adovada which is New Mexico red chile, short ribs w braised kale w guacamole and an egg on top. It was absolute heaven. It came w three hot tortillas that you can make into tacos. The short ribs were done perfectly and the egg over easy just complimented the dish perfectly. I loved it!! Needless to say, I couldn't even finish it so I took it home and enjoying it as my lunch today. Very happy w my experience and the food was seriously to die for!! Did I mention, they give out free cookies?? Yum!!",

I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience... Or a bad dish or drink, for that matter.   Food: everything on the menu here is GREAT. My personal favorites are: Starters - Deviled Eggs & Shrimp Ceviche (even though it's hard to narrow it down to these two) Dinner- Short Rib AND Surf & Turf Tacos (great that these are gluten free), also the Del Mar Salad (but, like I said, everything is great... I just had to pick a few here)  Service: Always top-notch. There's nothing to complain about.  Drinks: They have some unique, yummy drinks... the servers are all very knowledgable about what is in each drink and can make great suggestions, as well.  Parking: Valet is complimentary... there are very few spots that aren't valet and just trust me, you'll want to valet because it's a small lot with mostly valet... so just do it.  ....and don't forget to sneak a few of the salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out... so worth it!",

My friends and i came here after the movies on Sunday. We decided to sit at the bar. Right away we we're asked what we wanted for drinks. Considering we literally just sat down we all replied water. As we decided on our drinks it took the bartender another 15 mind to ask if We decided on drinks. We ordered drinks and then waited another 15mins. My friend literally had to wave his hand (though she was right in front of us) to get her attention. We ordered appetizers. Ceviche and the guacamole. We got the ceviche quick but it literally had two pieces of shrimp. Then we had to wait another 20mins (also had to remind them about it) for the guacamole and when it came out it looked like fake, processed filled with preservatives, like the store kind that are in tubs. Absolutely disgusting. We all decided to leave and go somewhere else. Never again will we be visiting this establishment. Such a shame as their patio is great but man they need to work on customer service AND make quality food.",

Pros: quick service from a kind and attentive staff  with a decent menu selection. Cons: the entire restaurant smelled of smoke from the smokehouse area in back and the food was just average. I didn't have a bad experience but it definitely isn't a place I feel the need to eat at again.",

Chelsea's Kitchen manages to mix a classy environment (multiple lamborghinis in the valet-run parking lot at once?!) with friendly service and dang good food.  I've tried a lot of the dishes here.  The swordfish, ahi, and short rib tacos are always a hit, but I honestly haven't gone wrong yet with the Fish of the Day.  Last week, I had grouper.  I'd never eaten grouper before, but somehow Chelsea's managed to make it tender and pair it with an absolutely delicious sauce.  The deviled eggs are my favorite appetizer, and the chocolate cake paired with a french press coffee is heavenly for dessert.  That said, I might go off my standard meal plan next week... one of my friends had the prime rib and it was perfectly cooked and literally as big as her face.",

    "text": "Made my first trip here last week after hearing great things about it for over a year.  We were winding down after a 3-day business meeting with lots of out of town guests from LA.  My first impression was WOW!, what a fantastic location and a cool setting.  We sat in the back patio that has really nice feel and good overhead cover for warmer days.    I immediately ordered the Basil Gimlet and it was a great starter cocktail, light and really refreshing.    We then ordered the Chicken Nachitos as a so called starter.  This thing came out piled high and full of chicken breast meat.  It was great and a bit much for a couple of people.  You may want to split a meal if only two people share this.  It was delicious even though they could have been a bit more generous with the salsa that came on the side.  Finally we ordered the Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad with the rotisserie Jidori chicken and the Smoked Roasted Jidori chicken with the Market Vegetables.    The Shredded Kale and Quinoa salad and the Market Vegetables were clearly the stars of both meals.  The Market Vegetables consisted of flaked Brussels Sprouts leaves rubbed in olive oil and crisped slightly with butternut squash.  It was really really delicious with great texture.  The same for the Kale and Quinoa.  I love a good kale but throw in some healthy protein and season properly and I may just copy it... and I have already with mixed results.   My only real issue with the meal was that the Jidori Chicken fell a little flat.  It wasn't well seasoned as I would expect with many normal rotisserie chickens but I expected this chicken with the fancy name and the word \"Smoke\" attached to it to be elevated and it didn't quite hit the mark.  I was there with several others that seemed to love their meals but I didn't have any of those.    I will return because of the atmosphere and the great service but I will avoid the \"Jidori\" chicken.  Definitely recommend visiting if not for the locale and atmosphere alone.",

The nachitos ( nachos with chicken) are amazing and even if you don't see them on the menu ask for them and they can make them.  The green chili cheeseburger and the vegetarian burger are also delicious.  Tried The lemon ricotta pancakes today and were really tasty.  The drinks are rather pricey but for brunch you can get bottomless Mamosa's for only $12. The green chili cornbread never disappoints.  Parking can be difficult but they have the \"complimentary \" valet which I do not care for, but they have ample bicycle parking along the canal.",

He informed us of his favorite menu items and got our drinks. The atmosphere is rustic, classy, warm, and charming; the perfect place to chat with a friend, have a business lunch, or even a romantic evening out. The tables are very comfortable and are not packed in next to each other. After letting us study the menu and chat a bit out waiter returned to take our order. We each had the tuna salad and thought it was delicious. If I had not been wanting a healthy salad for lunch I would have gone with the burger and fries because the man at the table next to us had one and it looked and smelled incredible. I will definitely be returning to have the burger. The other dishes on the menu looked enticing as well; tacos with various meats, brussel sprout salad, sandwiches, and fish to name a few.   Chelsea's is not cheap, but you do pay for quality, and you can taste it in the food as well as experience it with the service they provide. We were never without drinks and always waited on promptly. On your way out be sure to grab a chocolate chip sea salt cookie, they are so yummy!

Now children no longer eat free from the hours of 3-6pm, it will cost you $4.00 per child. That was not even my biggest issue. My biggest issue is that I had a very inattentive waitress. My glass was always empty, responses were very short and to me it felt as if she was faking it throughout the whole time I was there. I know that children are not the easiest to handle, but I keep mine very under control. For the lack of service I received and having to pay for my two picky children's meals I will be frequenting Chelsea's Kitchen a whole lot less.",

NOW I can say they have the best swordfish tacos I've ever had ANYWHERE! They also have amazing guacamole, and I HATE AVOCADOS. I can't even tell you how much I despise that green, weird tasting vegetable. But, at Chelsea's Kitchen? I almost ate the entire bowl myself. I also ate their pico de gallo, and my major dislike for tomatoes is much higher than it is with avocado. Chelsea's had me eating foods I never thought I would, ever.   My husband ordered their Dixie Pan-Fried Chicken, and he loved that. I tried a bite and thought it was perfect! He said \"it's almost as good as my grandma's, and that's saying a lot!\"   It was very busy, and being a Saturday night I wasn't surprised, but the service was still very friendly and quick!

    "text": "Wifey and I decided to head out to dinner last night and decided on Chelsea's Kitchen. We've always been super fans of LGO so this just made sense to us. The menu is a bit all over the place, which I don't mind but my wife didn't find much she was interested in.  I had the short ribs with roasted veggies and a fried egg on top. Awesome dish, I could eat that again and again! The short ribs were cooked to perfection, the sauce velvety and delicious and the veggies perfect! The addition of the over easy egg on top was sublime! My wife ended up just getting a caesar salad and the ceviche, which are staples from LGO. Overall great service, ambiance and most importantly good food.",

    "text": "It's hard giving someone a 5 star review becuase there is always something they can improve on... So, my only complaint is that you cannot call ahead and order food to go. Sooo annoying. You have to actually valet your car, sit at the bar, order and wait...by yourself, and chances are you will order a drink becuase you look weird if you don't. Probably bc the place is so packed that they don't want to be just a food joint... they want you to drink. They weed out the cheaper customers and get the more bang for their buck customers this way.   This place gets 5 stars for the patio, the staff, the bbq seasoned french fries, the burgers, the tacos, pretty much any dish... yummy, yummy, yummy. It's tasty American food with a rustic/modern ambiance. It's great for a date the fire places, twinkle lights, and the comfy seating make it a warm place to enjoy a good dinner with your family and friends.",

I was in town on a job and needed a place to take my boss & client for dinner, found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try, couldn't of been a better choice, great vibe all around. Food is New Mexican-American, but definitely not tex-mex.  I'm from CA so a discerning critic on any spin of Mexican but this place does a great job of creating some quality dishes.  Appetizers are upscale taco shop style, tacos are solid, drinks are ok, but we ordering old fashions when maybe we should of gotten margaritas? And don't leave without a cookie, seriously good with the sea salt.   Either way the service was also on point and the design of the place is cool/mellow.  Scottsdale wasn't half bad & this place is the reason",

Chelsea's is busy, but I've never had to wait more than 30-35 minutes.  My go to items:  We order the Sangria.  It is unbelievable.  I rarely drink, but it is a must have.    The Short Rib Taco's.  The Short rib's are excellent, so flavorful.  The corn tortillas are served warm and soft.  The only thing I put on my short rib taco's is the guacamole because it is amazing.  I generally sub out the kale for their mash potatoes.    I recommend this place to everyone and no one has ever had a bad meal.  In fact, when people travel their they generally send me a pic of their meal to make me jealous.  I always am.  Don't forget to grab a chocolate chip cookie topped with Sea salt on the way out the door.  Although, sometimes you have to dust off some of the sea salt.    Great service, always friendly staff and the patio can't be beat when I travel from MN.",

While the second one was much better... the seeds in the bottom reassured me that it was made in house. Our second server was more confident, but less attentive. About five staff members circled our table before clearing our plates and bringing the check. The check came to $40 for one appetizer, one salad, and two non-alcoholic drinks. As i was leaving there was a tray of Maldon chocolate chip cookies, my girlfriend grabbed one and split it for us. She put the cookie in her mouth upside down and ran to the trash, nearly 50 percent of the cookie was salt. I wouldnt mind spending 40 dollars on lunch if the quality was there to back it. My experience does not reflect those that I have heard from LGO. Unfortunately I will not be returning.",

Service - outstanding! Atmosphere - awesome.  I love the smell of a wood fired oven when you walk in.  Food:  Tuna tartare w/guacomole on chips - orgasmic.  I make good guac but this stuff was over the top.  Short rib tacos.  First of all, street sized homemade corn tortillas that were deliciously moist.  the short ribs were absolutely incredible and you can separate the meat by barely touching with a fork.  It comes with black beans which are so well seasoned over white rice.  Fresh salsa, more guacamole.  It was so friggin tasty.    On the way out, they have freshly baked chocolate chips cookies with sea salt, which are complimentary.  I love this place and will definitely be back.  They have such a great menu and so many things to try.    I would have never stopped at this place unless I hadn't read the Yelp reviews.  it also came highly recommended by the Concierge at Intercontinental Montelucia in Paradise Valley.",

The crab cake Benedict was perfect.  You get 2 crab cakes with huge lumps of real crab meat perfectly fried to a slight crisp. Their prime rib was also VERY good. It was a thick cut with just the right amount of fat to keep it nice and juicy. I'm definitely coming back!",

We started with a cocktail on the patio side of the bar, and moved to a table inside when it was ready.  Appearing on our table (we all shared) was the kale and quinoa salad, the cheeseburger on leaf instead of bun, ribeye, pan fried chicken, grilled salmon and the baked mac n' cheese.   Each dish was well presented, good portions and solid flavor. The kale salad and cheeseburger were AMAZING. The ribeye, salmon and mac n' cheese were all very good, and the pan fried chicken was OK. Given the way the four of us felt about all the other items, the chicken was just not up to par.  We finished with really good coffee and a shared dessert of key lime pie with pecan graham cracker crust and the most amazing strawberry gelato any of us have ever tasted. As an added bonus, it's vegan! (A bonus for me, as I have some dairy issues - knowing it was vegan I didn't have to worry about the risk!)  Service was flawless, the room was welcoming and comfortable, and I look forward to many more meals here!",

Even when you say you don't want another one they'll bring one and charge you for it. A stupid CAN.  Brings the class of this place down several notches.  They also brought one of our group the wrong entree - not prepared wrong, but the entire entree wrong. The rest of us were 3/4 done before the right food was brought. No apology, just \"is this better now?\" Well, duh, yes it's better, it what we ordered... Overall, the food was ok, nothing special, most of it needed to be seasoned. We probably would have enjoyed it more if not for the service failures. And free cookies on the way out - chocolate chip with SALT on them. Blech.",

I had the halibut special with vegetables.  It was really nice.  I thought the halibut was flaky and nicely cooked.  The flavors were also well done, nothing too intense, soft subtle flavors but helped bring out the veggies and the white flaky fish.  It was really yummy.

Right upon walking in the place has an amazing smoky smell that is really pleasant and (at least for me) throws me into a relaxed/hanging out with my friends at a campfire sort of mood. The menu has a lot of options for everyone, including vegetarians. I had the vegetarian tacos and they were amazing! The portions are huge, and everything on the plate is perfectly flavored and tastes so good by itself and even better together. The guacamole is spot on fresh, the pico de gallo is bright & citrusy that perfectly balances out the garlic veggies, and the kale slaw is just awesome. Hard to describe the flavor other than hearty greens with sweet tomatoes and wonderfully nutty quinoa - it's totally healthy and good tasting. The tortillas that come with the dish are soft and fresh, though tiny. The whole plate is fantastic and I would happily eat many many meals of it. It is a little pricey at $15 but I do think it's worth every penny, and I had a little bit of leftovers to take for an afternoon snack.  This is a perfect go-to spot for workday lunches or lounging weekend meals. Highly recommend!",

Knowledgeable waiters and chefs. I would eat here every day if I could afford it. Plus all the wine I drink here - pretty great list (but not a lot of Arizona wines - I would take them down 1/2 a star for that if I could).",

    "text": "Oh Chelsea... I envy you. You have 54 reviews, why not one more?  Chelsea's Kitchen is located on a sort of \"landmark\" for me; this location (not building - just real estate) has been so many fun things over the years. I am happy that Chelsea found her home here.  The menu changes with specials and chef's delights, so one night you might find yourself eating a surf and turf and the next a really great seasonal salad.  The drinks are flowing (try the LGO) - I didn't like their beer selection, but no biggie the pitcher of LGOs made us happy.  I LOVE the fact that their menu doesn't have a million things on it....You don't need a million options. Just a few very well executed and well prepared dishes.  We started off with the nachitos - this is a meal in itself. You could share this with a few drinks and be just fine. The chicken didn't overpower the other elements and the tortilla chips are fresh and, imho, the way tortilla chips *should* taste...  This last visit, I had the short ribs. They were tender enough to cut with a fork. The over-easy egg on top was a nice addition. There were tender baby veggies on the bottom which also was nice.  We ended the meal with chocolate pecan pie with fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing more to say about this other than it was fabulous.  There is a burning fire outside and inside, a nice cozy bar that's big enough to not feel like you're standing on top of your neighbor, and the staff (even management) was not pretentious or rude. They were accommodating and happy.  My only drawback is this (and it's not worth taking a star off of)This is one of those really trendy places - so if you get intimidated by that *crowd* or you just don't have the patience for *them* I would suggest going either a little later or a little earlier. But I wouldn't use this as an excuse to not go to Chelsea's.  Simply stated, this isn't a 3 star experience. This is far above 3 stars. Chelsea's continually delivers a great meal with a great atmosphere. It's not hit or miss; but it's not a hole in the wall either....",

We waited and waited and waited and after an hour waiting for our food a lady comes to apologize for the slow service which and said our order will be out soon....tick tock again the order arrived.  My cheeseburger was the worst ever...I should have just gone to Burger King were it taste better.  My friends food was cold and I had enough. The initial server we had never came back to us to see if we needed anything but we notices he was at everyone elses table. The outcome was we didn't pay and we left.  Somehow I am still speechless from the poorest service I've ever received.  Their was no excuse for bad service and bad food! Save your money.",

    "text": "After hearing a lot of buzz about this restaurant, I finally got the chance to check it out.  I had attempted to go a few weeks earlier, but the hour wait for a table was a little too much for my already-growling stomach to handle.  This time we called in a reservation, which made our wait pretty non-existent.   First thing to note was that the place was very busy and pretty noisy.  Not as noisy as Delux, but soft-spoken people are going to have to take it up a notch.  Luckily, my party was comprised of pretty loud people, so we were okay.  When things did periodically quiet down, there was a pretty cool selection of music playing ranging from Iron and Wine to Simon and Garfunkel.   We were seated at a table in the center of the dining room that had two chairs on one side and a bench seat on the other.  Being relatively short, a couple of us found a bit of a challenge sitting in the bench, which is a little lower than at some other places.  It wasn't horrible, but we definitely had to sport excellent posture all night.   To start the meal, we ordered the Chicken Nachitos.  The portion was not giant, like you see at many other restaurants, but a good size for all five of us to split and still keep our appetites.  We ordered a couple of burgers, a prime rib and the crab cakes.  The burgers were delicious, possibly even better than those at Delux (gasp!).  The review of the prime rib was good as well.  The crab cakes, which were a special that night, went over well, although for two crab cakes and an ear of corn, the price of $30 seemed a little hefty.  For dessert we ordered the Turtle Sundae.  It was your average sundea but with the hot fudge and sprinkles on the side, so you can be as conservative or crazy with them as you'd like.   Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Cute place, good food, nice atmosphere.    That being said, I do have one complaint in regards to their beverages.  Soda is served by the can with a glass of ice, something that is the norm in places like NYC and Europe.  That's fine, you don't want the hassle of dealing with a fountain.  I'll deal.  I will say that it is pretty annoying when combating the desert heat of Phoenix.  Charging $2 for a can of soda that probably costs less than a tenth of that when bought in bulk just seems like highway robbery.  Phoenix has always been the land of free refills, proabably because it's really hot here and people need to drink a lot of fluids to survive.  It's not just the soda that they're stingy with though.  A few members of the party ordered iced teas and lemonades, which came already poured in large glasses with ice.  That setup seems made for free refills, but they too were charged for each glass.  Additionally, there were times when our server or another staff member came up to the table and refilled the glasses without even being asked, helping us to rack up a non-alcoholic drink bill equal to the prime rib.  C'mon.  It's hot here.  Really hot.  People drink a lot of liquid.  Why be so stingy with the beverages?",

    "text": "I was very surprisingly underwhelmed by Chelsea's Kitchen.   We walked in and the restaurant smells amazing with the open kitchen and I really dig the atmosphere. Our first impression was that our server- Katie McD- seemed kind of flighty and not very attentive, so that is never a good start. She wasn't very friendly and didn't even attempt to build a rapport with the table. She kept forgetting small things that should be second nature for servers. I ordered my iced tea, and had to wait until she came back with our appetizer to get a straw. (The same happened later to my cousin after she finished her sangria and ordered another drink) I then asked for sweetener and she turned around, grabbed it from another table and then put it in front of me saying 'They weren't using it.\".. kind of awkward.   It has been my experience that great food can really overshadow bad service. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed once our meals came out. Maybe I had too high of hopes for Chelsea's Kitchen, after all I have had an ongoing love affair with La Grande Orange for years. I had the Dixie Pan Fried Chicken and it was just okay. The first thing I sampled was my mashed potatoes.. which were very lukewarm. Same for the mixed veggies (which were otherwise quite tasty)/ We waited about 5 minutes for Katie to come back and check so I could let her know, but got bored of it, and finished eating my now even colder plate.  They have a good portion size, not too much and the price would have been okay if my food had been served correctly (or even corrected). My meal came with a cinnamon roll which was really yummy and so was the red velvet cake we had for dessert. Definitely the best parts of my meal. (Dessert probably would have been better with coffee... if our server had been around to take our order..)   I kind of go back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but I feel like 3 stars would be saying I'd go back and give it another go... and I doubt I will. The stars say it all: Meh, I've experienced better.",

Bottomless mimosas are $12, and although the menu is a little bit more expensive, the food is very much worth it. If you're looking for a unique and impressive dish, try the Chilequiles.

We ate inside due to rainy weather and the first thing you are greeted with when you walk in is the mouth watering, smoky aroma from the rotisserie. It has a very comforting and pleasant environment. I ordered the short rib tacos, which are outstanding and can feed 3 people. They hand make the corn tortillas on premise. My husband had the rotisserie chicken, which was equally amazing. Super juicy and flavorful. Also love that you can order wine by the 6 oz glass or 10 oz carafe. Alissa, our server, was so attentive and friendly and made the visit complete. We will be back again for sure!",

Again, they hit another home run.   We ate on the patio, which filled up by 10:30 a.m. on this particular Sunday. There were all sorts of people, mostly Arcadia types with their Lululemon, Ray Bans and their small dogs. The patio had trees but the sun was out in full force. It was great.  The brunch menu was filled with all kinds of food - salads, pancakes, short rib hash. I opted for a bit of decadence with the crab cake benedict. It was wonderful, full of flavor and not over cooked.   The service was very good. Our glasses were never empty and we didn't feel that we were neglected at any time. Our server took the time to answer all of our questions (two of my guests have some \"food issues\") with a pleasant demeanor and high level of service.   Make sure to review their menu before you go, to see if it's something you'd like, but I'd highly recommend this place!",

Unfortunately it started raining and our table was the only one not really covered by the trees. After I noticed my salad plate filling up with water we asked to move over to the bar. Our server was super sweet about it and got us moved right away.   This is where the three star rating comes in. We overheard the two bartenders refer to us moving to their bar as \"I'm not helping..\" and other things they were clearly upset about -- eye rolls, the works. They didn't say one word to us for the next 25 minutes.   The bar was about half way full and there were plenty of seats. Not that that would ever be appropriate, but I could understand a little more if people were fighting to sit at the bar. Now I know why they're not.",

    "text": "Update: Thank you Chelsea's Kitchen for inviting me back. Fast forward to a couple months and our experience from before was like night and day. We visited again on a Sunday for brunch however this time we dined inside and it wasn't nearly as busy as our last visit. I was able to appreciate the lovely interior decor which is chic, cozy and welcoming. I couldn't help but notice the huge arrangement of fresh, yes, fresh flowers in the center of the dining room and the attention to detail of the wood ceiling, simple yet thoughtful red curtains and large lamps.  The entire ambiance is that of an upscale yet cozy down to earth home.  The music playing in the background is the perfect blend of jazzy/modern/brunchy/feel-good sound, played at the perfect volume. The small but well appointed bar was buzzing with guests and as I passed by it on my way to visit the restroom I couldn't help but notice the large volumes of \"Sangria Pitchers\" being made. Which goes without saying their Sangrias are superb! Let's get to the food ordered...1. Short rib hash with over easy eggs were deliciously made, well presented and enough to feed a village!   2. Short rib tacos which is fitting for a Sunday Supper, these were perfectly made, moist, seasonsed well,  and worthy of eating with just a fork however they do come with a side of corn tortillas, salsa, freshly made chunky guacamole, and a slaw of (kale?), the amount of meat was enormous and I was only able to eat 1/4 of my entree. 3. As a starter we had the chips, salsa and guacamole which were all authentic and made  with fresh ingedients...4. Best for last, the pitcher of white sangria! Spectacular! This sangria is a must if you are here as it consists of diced apples, citrus and is a light refreshing party in a pitcher but definitely packs a punch after 2 glasses. The glass pitcher is a bit heavy to handle, thankfully our attentive server ensured our glasses remained full. The service was top notch and I look forward to now sharing this lovely establishment  with friends and family. Sidenote; I did not inform management that we were invited here, nor did we use the gift card that was given to us from our first visit. Our goal was to truly give them an authentic 2nd chance.",

And the last time we ordered cornbread as an appetizer, and damn was it delicious. And while typically this place has always been solid for us and the family unfortunately our last time here was not so great. Our service was just out of character, Arthur was the name of our server and unfortunately very rude. Would tell us to shhh, when he couldn't find something on his iPad. And although he didn't say anything rude TO us, you could tell by his demeanor that was a really cocky dude. Which in real life is cool but at a restaurant with the family is just unnecessary. It was just awkward every time he came to he side of the table. Either way, make yourself out to Chelsea's Kitchen, but make sure to get served by anyone but Arthur.",

When a restaurant has prices for food like they do, I expect to enjoy everything I eat.  Unfortunately, that's not the case here.  Their food and sides are hit and miss and I don't feel like I'm getting the value of what I'm paying for. For example, I ordered the beef tacos.  The beef was great and prepared nicely with a tasty marinade.  However, the guacamole side was bland and the kale slaw just did not taste good to me (and I usually love kale, the kale salad from True Food is one of my favorite salads!)  Plus the wait on the weekends is kind of ridiculous.  I'm glad they are popular and more power to those who love this place, but it's not my preferred dining destination.",

When I heard word that CK was offering a Fourth of July special (buy one entree, get the second for $4), I thought it was time to see what all the fuzz was about.  Two weeks beforehand, I made plans with a cousin to have lunch here on the 4th.  What a surprise to find out that CK was serving brunch, as well, and we breakfast lovers were thrilled to check out the breakfast items.  While our server went to check on a few ingredients for me, my cousin decided she'd try one of CK's more popular menu items, the Green chile burger, with poblano chile, cheddar, and chipotle aioli. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg#MrEVQGZ6ZpX_8iuN0UWPxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoL...</a>  As you may notice, the kitchen had forgotten to add the chipotle aioli, but this was quickly remedied when we asked for some.  (Service during lunch was very friendly and quick.)  I couldn't decide between the French omelet (which, funnily enough, my cousin and I initially mistook to be French toast and wanted to order this immediately) and the Lemon-ricotta hotcakes, but when I was told I could order one pancake for around $2, I chose the Classic French omelet, with sauteed spinach, gruyere, and herbs <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA#TVcjVg-hfSZCtnFq3FnaZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoL...</a> and a hotcake.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA#dtpAV4WfApPEZx_PvczrxA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoL...</a>  The omelet struck me as overcooked, and it was.  I asked my cousin to try it, and she too didn't like it, so I let our server know, and she quickly offered to take it away and replace it with something else.  I chose a plate of hotcakes, since we pretty much inhaled the first one!  I apologize for the lack of a photo...  My hunger got the best of me.  BTW, cousin loved her burger-- she finished all of the meat!  I never knew she could eat as much as me.  :)  The decor was beautiful-- lovely dark wooden tables and chairs, cozy booths lined with dark wooden beams, and heavy red fabric curtains, lightened with light-colored flowers, adorned the windows.  It felt classy bistro married country French and had a baby.  It worked for me.    A few days leading up to the Fourth, I thought a friend would enjoy trying out the dinner menu with me, so we agreed to meet there slightly before 6p.  It was very busy, much louder, and darker indoors that night.  The wait proved to be around 30 mins, or so, and we were given a buzzer as we elected to wait at the bar.  He ordered a cucumber-laced cocktail, while I asked for a blackberry-prickly pear concoction.  Both glasses were served to us without coasters or napkins, so our glasses left puddles on the table from which water would eventually end up dripping from our glasses to other points of the table, or, in my case, on me.  Even when we were finally seated at the table, our cocktail glasses remained un-coastered (is that even a word?), but now we had water glasses, too.  What a mess...  Before we were seated, I had to use the restroom, and I'd already noted earlier, as we walked towards the bar, that it's much harder to traverse the restaurant's space on my four-inch heels.  Not so much because of the heels, but because the textured floor was very slippery, and it wasn't even wet then.  On my return from the restroom, I had to pass the hallway between the kitchen and the bar, and I slipped on a water spill.  Thankfully, I was able to recover without having to hit the ground, but when I hailed a passing employee to alert her of the spill, how I almost had an accident, and that maybe she could see that it was taken care of, she just looked at the spill, then at me, and then proceeded to head to wherever she was going before I stopped her.  She didn't acknowledge that there was a problem, so I assumed she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it.    The food was OK-- he wanted to try the salmon ($22), but was going to order the filet mignon ($37) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA#W6wIGzyT32_AvSvqe7uuHA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoL...</a>, and I secretly wanted to try the filet, so I ordered the fish, so that we could try both!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoLzudHC50oJLiEWpwV-w?select=oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg#oDlf6yqCLHn7uw3SuZfflg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/IsoL...</a>  The filet was TERRIFIC.  Perfectly cooked- he asked for pink throughout, but there were a few red spots.  Still tasted amazing.  The kitchen ran out of mixed veggies so friend ended up with bok choy, which he's never had before, but soon learned to like it.  The salmon would've been very good, if it didn't have a slight rancid-fish taste to it.  The lemon-white wine reduction helped.  Still, our plates were clean at the end of our meal.  (He was hungry.)  Thanks to CK for brunch and dinner.  In spite of a few mishaps, we all enjoyed the experiences.",

    "text": "Update: After posting this review, the restaurant got in contact with me to make it right. Their response was quick and shows that they really value their customers. I would definitely give this place another shot and I'm confident that it was just an off night. I would like to change my stars to 5 stars now.   With it being noted that we had eaten some appetizers elsewhere first and that we went right before it closed, the food wasn't that great. I think our friends who ordered tacos were a lot happier with their food. (I guess generally people who order tacos instead of a kale salad are probably happier with their food.) We ordered salmon with our salad and for some reason it didn't print right on the ticket to the kitchen and we had to wait extra after all our food came out. When we ordered dessert apparently the freezer wasn't working and the gelato was melted and limited as to which we could order. (They said the freezer wasn't working right.) Our desserts were comped on the whole table because of the freezer situation but I would have liked to have been given more as we had to wait until our friends were almost done eating to enjoy the salmon that went with our salad.",

Bottomless mimosas, amazing huevos rancheros  and burgers. I will definitely be back.  Price wise, it is on the upper end --everything was upwards of $15 per plate. The bottomless mimosas at $12 were reasonable and I believe the valet is complimentary and the line is usually long so that's a plus.   The location doesn't look like much outside but the space has been utilized quite beautifully inside and out with a bar that serves the back patio and inside the restaurant. If you're looking for a hole in the wall, this isn't it. If you're looking for a nice place to have brunch or dinner, this is a good choice.  Edit: on my last visit, I sat at the bar...the service at the bar was trash. Although I enjoyed my food, I had to wait far too long to be acknowledged and it was not busy enough for that to be the case. You don't have to like your job however when you work in a customer serving role,please act like it.",

Well, we got lucky, because our server, Ashley, was a bird whisperer. Not sure how she did it, but she somehow learned to talk to the birds, and get them to move on command. Good thing, because apparently plenty of people have complained that Chelsea's hasn't done enough to take care of the bird issue. Who would've thought that an awesome patio, under a huge tree, would have birds around it?! Personally, I think one of the charms of eating outdoors is to get to hear the sounds of nature. But for those who are scared of flora and fauna, and yet want to sit outside, well, I'd recommend requesting the bird whisperer Ashley - not only is she super nice and super awesome, but she's also got a super power! Even Mowgli would be impressed. Oh, and get the fries - obvi. I could eat those fries all day.",

The lovely walkway leading up to the large wooden door was beautiful. The landscape leading to the door was very pretty and I managed to crack a smile at the water fountain. I love the little bear splashing in the water.   The entrance felt warm and inviting. I'm not referencing the fact that it was 104 degrees. The vibe when I first walked in felt casual, and very relaxed. I was greeted right away by two servers and a very beautiful hostess. I love the warm colors and the open floor plan. The open kitchen to the right was also very nice to look at. The Chef's/cooks were clean, the kitchen looked very clean and very busy. I witnessed no one standing around.  I sat on the patio as requested. I love that there is no bad table there. The patio is surrounded by beautiful trees. I sat in a corner with my back to the canal so I can see the goings on around me. I don't patronize bars, however, If I were too, this is a beautiful bar. From the inside, the bar opens itself to the patio. Very nice, quaint and casual.   I was greeted by Dakota. This young man was awesome.  He greeted me with a genuine smile and a willingness to spend time sharing  recommendations for a first timer. Dakota was attentive, and very gracious.   He recommended the \"Green Chili Burger.\" Sold! the description from the menu got my mouth watering. This massive charbroiled burger patty was at least an inch and a quarter thick. That alone is 5 stars, as most places are serving thin little patties. This medium rare patty was laid atop a thick, crunchy piece of iceberg lettuce, topped with real cheddar cheese and topped again with Ortega chili's.  The seasoned, freshly ground to order patty in concert with the other flavors were enough to satisfy this carnivore, but that's not all...Add to that my requested \"Well Done\" French fries. This sent me over the top. The portions were amazing for the price. I love the seasoning as it had a slight sweetness to it. Dakota said it was a BBQ dry rub with a hint of brown sugar. Mmmmm...mmm.   The price was good for what you get. I am well satisfied. My only shock came at the price of a 12 oz can of Diet Coke. Yes... can's of coke for $2.25. Sticker shock? Absolutely. However, Given my overall experience, I am more than willing to overlook this petty complaint. I will return. This place is great. Certainly worth every penny spent. And hey, ask for Dakota. Tell him Thought Creep sent ya.",

We went on a Saturday night, around 7:00PM and had to wait about 20 minutes, but got a table indoors, which is key in this mid-100 degree summer weather. The food was seriously incredible. I got the burger with a side of french fries (that come in their special BBQ seasoning!!) and they were easily able to accommodate for my gluten and dairy allergies. For those who are gluten intolerant, their fries are gluten-free! My boyfriend got the fried chicken and mashed potatoes, which came with collard greens and garlic biscuit that he said was truly delicious. He got a grapefruit cocktail and raved about that as well.  We would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful restaurant that sources local and fresh. I mean, where else can you get a local,grass-fed burger with a huge side dish for $15, without making it yourself? We will definitely be back!",

I think it might have something to do with it being a \"nut\" burger which is not like the usual black bean or mashed veggie burger.  I also liked how it was chard a little, which gave it that comforting BBQ-like texture.  I chose the steamed vegetables as a side dish which came out as perfectly seasoned and cooked green beans.  For desert I ordered the red velvet cake (its not on the menu - so ask!), and it was the second best red cake I have ever had - the first is my mama's recipe.  I consider myself a bit of a red cake snob, but this one gets two thumbs up!   The parking lot a bit too small, which is the downside.",

Specifically, I think they may have the best veggie burger I've ever had. The tuna tacos are almost as good, when they're on the menu.  Speaking of things that aren't on the menu, they sometimes have a summer melon salad with almonds and avocado...holy sh*t, it's refreshing and delicious. But again, it's never on the menu and only available seasonally, so make sure you ask for it.  I go with Jenn H. all the time, and her favorite is the short ribs with the fried egg on top. Far from kosher, but extraordinary nonetheless. And for what it's worth, Chelsea's was featuring short ribs far before it became the standard of every hip eatery across the nation.  Overall this restaurant is a strong, consistent star. Plus it's open late...and you know I like that.",

Great, fast service with good drink and wine selection. The food was awesome. We started with the nachos that were loaded with yummy toppings and not soggy at all (which a lot of nachos suffer with). We decided to share a few platters of tacos so we could taste everything - the swordfish, pork and rib tacos were dynamite! Everything was really fresh and flavorful. We also opted to share a few desserts. Both the Red Velvet Cake and Key Lime Pie were to die for. I can't say I was disappointed by a darn thing. Above all, great service by the waitstaff.",

I had the fried chicken dinner and was less than enthused.  The chicken pieces were only partially breaded and fried.  After a few sangrias, I decided to enjoy my guilty pleasure... and there was barely any fried chicken skin!  Sadness.  It should have been called a breaded chicken because it was definitely not a fried chicken!  Ok... soapbox aside... my friend had the rotisserie prime rib and it was jam packed with flavor without the heavy salt crust.  Definitely something different to try.",

The service was attentive and professional.  We had the Brussels sprout salad, which was one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and the ribeye taco platter.  The steak was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful.  It was truly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. My husband and I actually split everything and it was just enough.   For dessert we had the pistachio gelato which was also amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

So, the location is perfect.  Second, you MUST have their ceviche! I love it so much that I often go there just to eat it and have a few drinks. It's SOAKED in lime juice and I salivate as I talk about it right now! It really is fantastic.  Equally as good (well, almost) are their Chicken Nachitos which are, believe me, a meal unto themselves (unless you're sharing... and I suggest you don't because they're so good.)  The only drawback at all is that it gets kind of loud in there. The acoustics aren't good when there's a crowd (and there always is.)   Oh, and one more drawback is the parking is inadequate. Unless you're ok with valet (and I personally feel lost without my car keys with me at all times), you should try and go early or late.   But, don't let these two things stop you. It's one of the best places in the Valley for dinner and drinks!",

After a long wait and a really friendly and helpful staff who tried to speed up the process we were finally seated on the back patio. CK's patio is enchanting and to be honest, it's worth the ridiculous wait to sit back there.   After a quick glance at the menu, me and my 3 other friends all ordered... Tacos! One of us ordered the pork, another the ribs, third the steak and me the swordfish.   I'm sure that the swordfish was the best of the bunch though my friends would probably argue that. It was cooked so perfectly, the flavor was amazing and it really did melt in my mouth. The swordfish tacos came with gauc, picco de gallo and a small melon salad.  All of us were in complete heaven. Our meal was amazing, Nicole, our waitress was fun and attentive and the ambiance was perfect. I can't wait to go back.",

My evening started at the bar having a cocktail waiting for my and the bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive.  When my girlfriend arrived I checked in with hostess, who by the way was smiling ear to ear.  She stated that she had a table available either on the patio or in the inside, we choose the patio. From this moment on everything was almost to good to be True. Our server was attentive but not invasive, the food, don't get me started!  I will say this... If u have not tried chelsea's Kitchen, then you have not experience amazing food and great service.  This foodie is now hooked on Chelsea's and I will be there  every week for my fish tacos, and red velvet cake!   Thanks for the great time!",

We had a 30 minute wait to sit indoors (busy Saturday evening) and enjoyed a cocktail on the patio while waiting. I had the fish special for the night, Halibut with fingerling potatoes, tomatoes and a jalapeno crema sauce. It was delicious! Some other dishes ordered at my table were the picnic chicken, which my picky husband loved, filet and the prime rib. All meals were enjoyed highly. Even the complimentary chocolate chip and sea salt cookies at the host stand were delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!",

    "text": "Came here for a celebratory dinner for my friend. There were about 15 in our group and we were seated outside on the well heated patio. We had five heaters around us! We had two servers who were super efficient. They got drink orders in and out with each guest/s that arrived at all the various times.   The group started with 2 orders of the chicken nachitos loaded with yummy guacamole that were quickly devoured. For my main entree I ordered the surf and turf tacos which consists of lobster and filet mignon. I like the fact that Chelsea's Kitchen offers gluten free options without extra charge, but I still went with the corn tortillas that come standard with any taco entree option. Holy delicious! I can't even accurately describe the party that went on in my mouth! The dish came with a kale salad, guacamole, and pico de gallo. There were two dipping sauces, aioli and a salsa type, the aioli came out on top and landed on every bite that went into my mouth. I really wanted to lick the little container it came it, but I had to pretend to be a lady. The filet was cooked medium, but looking back I should have gotten it prepared at the medium rare temperature because the outside was pretty cooked.   For dessert I split the sundae with a friend and I love that you get to put your own toppings on. When you order the sundae you get two sauces: carmel and chocolate and three toppings: rainbow sprinkles (or jimmies for my East Coasters), Oreo crumbles, and chocolate and peanut butter chips! So fun to create your own dessert! The service and food were spectacular (especially for a large group) and I can't wait to come back for another meal!",

The place is very popular and packed at lunch and early for dinner. Come at 11:30 or 1 or expect to wait and have to valet if the lot is not full. Food has been consistently good, fresh and well portioned. Place is loud and casual but upscale. I described it to one person as the kind of healthy fashionable place where the wives, mistresses and exes of all the guys eating at Houston's are eating ( I pause here to make a cougar claw motion with my hand), when they are not clogging up Postino's parking lot or backing into my f*cking car at La Grande Orange. They even have some similar menu items and do upscale \"American\" grill food like salads, burgers, pasta and the other usual suspects with a couple of surprises thrown in.   The nice thing about the kind of generic menu is that there is something on it for every taste and dietary restriction no matter how fussy. I'll clarify, I don't use \"generic\" in the pejorative sense, I'm just saying they have all the usual stuff of a place of this type. Lots of loose action in the house here.",

We started with \"white\" sangria, which none of us had heard of before, despite prior visits. The \"white\" is a pinot grigio so it was an easy decision to order the pitcher. The sangria was delightful - we didn't quite finish the wine, but the pitcher-ful of fruit was polished off.  My swordfish tacos were delicious and filling. My friend's fried chicken (a special) was good but a bit dry. I suggested gelato after dinner; no one had room.  Service was a bit inattentive. The table seated after us received menus, waters and had their order taken before we had a server approach the table. After the first server, another seemed to take over and things got better.  The atmosphere at Chelsea's is good, as others have pointed out. It's a great place to hang out. The setting is beautiful. I will return.",

The decor inside was really stylish but being such a beautiful day we really wanted to sit on the back patio! There were 8 of us total yet the hostess was able to accommodate us quite quickly considering the relatively large number of our party. The patio has really great ambiance and backs up to a canal path that I would have definitely explored had we not had to leave for our game.  My Chiliquiles were delish and was so filling I didn't even need to buy any crappy ball park food later in the day. The Hubby's Prime Rib Hash looked amazing (even though I don't eat meat) and my sister in laws Kale and Quinoa salad was sooo tasty. Add in some White Sangria and a Bloody Mary and you got your self a pretty perfect little brunch!",

Even in the winter it's not cold under the heaters. Too bad the food was  as disappointing as my morning meals there.  Most of the items on the dinner menu don't interest me (their street taco plates and salads, while good, just aren't enough food for me, fried chicken with gravy is way too far on the other end of the spectrum and there ain't much in between), so I stick to the burgers which would be very good if they were executed according to the menu description.  Last week my green chile burger came with a bunch of stuff different from the menu including, of all things, pickles.  Pickles, not on the side, but smack on the green chile burger so the pickle juice could run into the green chile and burger.  Nasty.  I go back for the service, but really need to remember to get a bite before going next time.",

Chelsea's kitchen sounds like a casual kind of place but was pleasantly surprised at the fountain outside, sea salt cookies upon arrival and the cozy vibe inside, equipped with a fireplace. The wait to sit on the patio was almost 30 minutes for our party of 6 so we sat inside because we were hungry. The patio looked beautiful and it was a beautiful day so that was disappointing.  Instead, we were seated in a booth that barely fit everyone,  very squishy and uncomfortable.  I got the dreaded corner seat. We immediately order a pitcher of sangria,  which was poured for us table side. Very delicious, easy to get a few of these down. Service was nice and attentive.  We got the chicken nachitos to start and a huge plate of deliciousness arrived before us. The plate was filled with chips, rotisserie chicken,  guacamole,  salsa, sour cream and jalapenos.  Needless to say, they were a huge hit.   As I looked over the menu to order an entree,  nothing really sounded good to eat. No sandwiches were on the menu,  which would have been a nice lunch option. Salads, tacos, burgers and an random selection of appetizers are the choices down this one page menu. Prices were outrageous, anywhere from $11-30 for a lunch entree. For an LGO concept, this was a disappointment. My sister and I settled on splitting a caesar salad with chicken. Salad came split and was delicious.  I also heard the howie burger was amazing from a family member who ordered it, but didnt try it. My aunt ended up only ordering sides because nothing appealed to her. So, the food we ate was good, absolutely no complaints.  Would I come back? Probably if I was invited. I much prefer LGO down the street though.",

    "text": "I always have a good time at Chelsea's, if I'm meeting friends for an appetizer and a glass of wine. The fries are great, and the guacamole is fresh.   Every time I have dinner there, though, I am underwhelmed.  In my opinion, the food is often mediocre.  We've had steak ordered medium rare show up well done, the Del Mar salad is hit and miss, sometimes fresh and wonderful, but sometimes chewy. Our last visit, the crab cakes (for $33,00) seemed like they came frozen, salmon (ordered medium well) was very over cooked, with \"sauteed\" vegetables that were mushy and indescernable.   Two entrees and two drinks at $92.00, before tip? There are too many restaurants around serving really good food.   By the way, our food came out 4 minutes after we ordered it, which really made me curious.",

    "text": "Whoever Chelsea is, I want to hug and kiss her in all the right places, because she is doing it right!  Lucky and I arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm with no reservations- get off me, I have already taken my beatings for that.  But, as expected, there was a 45 min wait for a table.  And since it was Arizona in July, coupled with the chubby factor and my fight against fromunda cheese, we made the smart move to wait for a table inside.  The good news is that we found a couple seats at the bar to enjoy some adult libations.  What was supposed to be 45 minutes, was actually and hour and since we were pounding drinks, the bar tab was fairly hefty.  Not CK's fault, I just really like vodka and I was sitting at a bar, what else was going to happen?  But, the bartenders were good (AKA long poured) and my liver was in over drive.  Once we got to the table, we found the menu to look great just as others had mentioned, yet we asked the waiter for recommendations.  He suggested the surf and turf tacos as well as the pulled pork (hehe, I said pulled pork, but that was before our date), and the dude with the apron and hipster glasses knocked the cover off the ball!  They were awesome!  But, in the back of my head, I kept hearing this voice from past Yelpers... \"get the mac and cheese... get the mac and cheeeeeeese'.  So, I did what any almost sane/not-so-sober man would do, I got the mac and cheese for dessert!  Take that Dr. Your-Cholesterol-is-too-High!  I did it and I loved it.  If it wasn't so hot and melty, I may have smeared some on the body parts that my tummy blocks the view to!  So, do yourself a favor and get some, even Luddy Style- another meal for dessert.  Service- 4.5 stars- overall good, but the hipster said \"really?\" when I ordered my dessert.  F him.  Get a hair cut and good luck with your artist/acting career, Skinny Jeans. Food- 5+ stars- I can't wait to go back and try some new things and get more mac and cheese- and give Chelsea a 'good game' on her back side. Atmosphere- 4 stars- it reminded me a lot of Hillstone, so it was nice, but nothing special.  Though the patio will be perfect when it's not a bazillion degrees and the chances of down-low sweat decreases. Overall- 4 stars, and it would have been 5 had the wait been a little more realistic.   Maybe they should get a hostess with the mostess that doesn't need to take off her shoes to count more than ten... just a thought.  In the end, it was a great overall date night dinner with Lucky.  A few too many cocktails, great food, fantasies about noodles and hot cheese that I stored away in my spank bank, and the company of the hottest girl in the place.",

    "text": "What an over-rated pretentious place.  We went there on a wine club bike and dine event. First impression was nice. Bike parking by the water entrance, nice patio with trees.  We had a section outside reserved for our group but that section was not covered by trees and we didn't have any more places to sit or even stand comfortably so we sat down at a table next to the group on the patio.  10 minutes later no one brought us water or asked if we wanted anything but  a douche of a waiter covered in colorful tattoos told us we couldn't sit there because it was reserved for guests. I asked him why he thought that we weren't guests and he gave me an attitude about how this is for different guests and we had to get up in a threatening voice. He probably wanted this table for a tip that otherwise wouldn't have went directly to him.  Despite their greediness we still stayed with the group and went inside where I had a Mexican coke but I didn't think that it was warranted to spend 30 dollars on some ribeye tacos and a fancy alcoholic drink because I don't like being treated like cattle.  Within 15 minutes 4  tables opened up and I went back outside where I sat down at a table again and the tattooed jackass gave my wife and me a mean intimidating look as if he was about to get violent to the point that my wife was scared of him and wouldn't dare sit down.  I wonder if they hire their wait staff directly out of tent city.  Anyway, I'm not going back.",

I was surprised because it was mid week, but I thought it must be a great place.   It is a very warm and inviting place, with a beautiful dining room and patio area.   We sat inside.  The service was great, and the food was delicious.  We ordered: Chicken Nachitos, The Howie Burger, The Short Rib Taco Platter, Chelsea Burger, and the Ahi Tuna Burger. The beef is ground in house, and cooked medium rare- which was perfect.  The Nachitos were very good as an appetizer.   The Short Rib Taco Platter was delicious, and the server brought out additional warm tortillas as we were eating the tacos.  Overall, it is an outstanding restaurant, and I can't wait to go back!  They also let me bring a cake for my birthday which was nice!  Don't forget to grab a salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out!",

Well ONE HOUR later after we continually asked we were finally seated (should have just walked out). I brought my date there for his first time and this was already not a good start.   We were seated and I ordered my usual vegetarian taco platter. The waitresses' description of it sounded so good this time around. However, when it arrived there was only ONE vegetable dish on it next to the taco fixings of salsa and guacamole! Half of the plate was empty! On other visits its been overflowing with so much goodness. MAJOR disappointment.   After that I just wanted to get out of there, so we did not stay to get dessert or linger. Not a good first impression for someone at all : /",

My wife had the short rib tacos and it was decent, but could have had more flavor. We finished out meal with pumpkin pie and red velvet cake. They were both fairly good. The red velvet cake was comprised of several small layers separated with frosting. I would have preferred one large moist red velvet cake with only the frosting on the outside, but that's my personal preference.",

Which all in all was a waste of $$ and calories. We also ordered deviled eggs as an appetizer which had sweet relish in them which did not work either.  Bottom line- This place banks on there lame \"waterfront\" ( mud canal) atmosphere to serve crappy over priced food.

We arrived just after 11 and told the hostess we had a reservation, but she turned up her nose and said 1) they normally don't seat incomplete parties; and 2) they don't usually take reservations. Something must have quickly changed her mind, because she led us to a table in back. As noon came closer and closer, I soon understood her reasons...this place must be THE place to have lunch.  We were still stuffed from breakfast, but after taking a peek at the menu I forgot all about the egg sandwiches we sharing earlier. Appetizers, anyone? Why of course...let's have the ceviche! It was fresh, with a perfect balance of seafood and fresh avocado, lime and spices.  For an entree, I chose the grilled ahi tuna taco platter. It was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I felt a little bad for my table guests, because I rarely spoke as my mouth was full every time I looked up. The tuna couldn't have been cooked more perfect...and that chipotle aoili was UH-MAZING.  I tried my hardest to finish and managed to somehow fit almost everything in my stomach. When the dessert menu came around, I reluctantly declined a sweet I think for the first time in my life. I'm still kicking my own arse for not sucking it up and sinking my fork into the shared red velvet cake (made fresh daily).  Thank gawd I was wearing a loose sundress that day is all I can say.",

I was pleasantly surprised, I really enjoyed sitting outside. The building completely blocked the wind from the patio, it was perfect. They also have purse racks at your table! COOL!  It was much quieter outside compared to in and they were playing some Spanish guitar over the speakers, I Love that music.  I decided to order the Grilled Swordfish Tacos,  they were delicious and fresh (see pics) made to order grilled corn tortillas are Amazing! $18  I was still hungry after though..........  I saw some scallops go by to another table and wondered if that was a special because I didn't see it on the menu.  I asked my waitress,and YES they were a special, I decide to order that as well.  OH WOW!!! Absolutely Delicious!!!!!!  3 HUGE pan seared scallops on a bed of sweet corn polenta topped with wild mushrooms and a light gravy/sauce!! (see pics) $17  So ya I spent $50 on lunch for my self! (that's including a $10 tip)  Good food is worth every penny to me, I'll definitely go back but only order one entree next time.  For the record I do think the tacos were a bit over priced but the scallops were totally worth it!  5 stars for my waitress not telling me I'm a Pig!",

Never been here before... we were able to make a reservation since we were 5 people, but we also ate at 6 and it didn't get busy till 7.   I started with a lemonade drink that was supposed to have vodka in it. I think it was missing. The Cesar salad I had I enjoyed very much. And for my main belly stuffing entree I had the short rib tacos. There was plenty of food to feed 2 people. I loved the homemade soft tortillas and gauc.   Would I return, yes. I'd just get a different cocktail to start with.",

There is no analog in Denver, it is good food, great setting, cozy, yet energetic, a spectacular covered patio with a fireplace for those chilly days and evenings in AZ fall and winter months. OK What about the food? Eclectic menu, spectacular salads, elegant fish tacos, incredible guacamole, I had a crispy chicken spinach salad, to die for. My partner had swordfish soft tacos, the tortillas were wonderful, the fish perfectly cooked. The Del Mar seafood salad is absolutely yummy. The short rib tacos were not terrific, but then I am not a big fan of that rib meat. One piece of red velvet cake, shared amongst four, and it was devine, moist, soft, w the best cream cheese frosting. If you are in Phoenix, go to Chelsea's Kitchen.",

The ceaser salad was great, and the soup of the day (was kind of like a tortilla soup) was nice as well. My other friends ordered the arcadia salad and a chicken salad; they both enjoyed it. We also ordered the shrimp ceviche appetizer which was ok, even though I think it's ridiculous to pay 15 bucks for an appetizer. The same price for a salad is also a little insane but I guess if you have the money, why not? Seeing as how I'm a struggling college student, this place is not for me but might be cool for special occasions and the like.  The service was bad. Our waitress was not very friendly and never checked back in on us (2 bites, 2 minutes rule). We had another girl serve us the food and totally gave everyone each other's orders so we had to awkwardly do the switch-around-the-plates thing. We had to ask another guy to refill our drinks. It wasn't hardly busy, which was the odd thing...",

From having to valet park -- 90% of the parking spaces are reserved for valet -- to the menu choices and the food itself, I don't plan to go back.  I ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken, which I expected to be a really great Caesar Salad for the price.  Well, the chicken came as one chicken breast with the bone in on the side of the plate, so I had to cut the chicken off the bone myself.  The croutons were so large you had to try to cut them which is not an easy thing to do with a crouton.  So I would never order another Caesar Salad, and just didn't find that many other things on the menu that I would order.  Very sad.",

I especially enjoy the fish tacos, which come with a surprisingly good side of rice and beans. But my favorite item on the menu is the tuna tartar & guacamole appetizer. Nothing else on the menu really pops, but my friends and I haven't had any complaints yet.  Service is always strong, as with the other LGO properties. This is especially evident at Chelsea's Kitchen where it appears they have implemented the Houston's-style service approach, which is a Good Thing.  Finally, the thing that really makes Chelsea's Kitchen stand out is the building itself.  A great example of the sprawling, airy Arizona ranch-style house with great front and back patios. It can be difficult to get a seat on the back patio, but the rest of the restaurant is pleasant enough that I don't mind. The only negative comment I can make is that the bar is on the small side.",

First pet peeve (that includes Parlor) is being forced to valet park when the lot is half empty. Even if valet is complimentary. We were seated promptly and decor is simply gorgeous. My daughter had the PB&J kids meal and milk. I was pretty annoyed when they charged us for a refill on the milk. So, we got charged twice for two kids milks. I didn't see much that interested me on the menu so I ordered a few things I have gotten often at LGO: the shrimp ceviche and caesar salad. It was very good but odd that I was ordering LGO menu items. Pretty cool were the chocolate chip cookies on your way in/out. Can't beat that!

The chips were cooked JUST right I even used them for my MAC and cheese.   Now the famous Shirley temple yes that drink you got when you were younger to \"appear\" as if you had a mixed drink. Well I'm well over drinking age but a Shirley temple. Sounded refreshing and delicious and the waitress caught my smile when she brought me an old school glass sprite bottle.

I never have seen deviled eggs on an appetizer menu.  But they had them here and they were tasty.  We also enjoyed swordfish tacos and braised short rib tacos.  It was a lot and thought I would finish them.  But surprise the two of us who ordered them are it all.  Everything was delicious and service was great!",

This time I went with a group of six to Chelsea's, was greeted by a very kind host, and sat on the patio. Our drinks took a while to get to us, but no big deal. While our food was pretty good, the waitress Stephanie made the experience miserable. I had to ask multiple times for silverware and a napkin, got a napkin, never received silverware. Ended up eating with my hands. When asked to split the check, she acted extremely put out, and frustrated. A friend picked up the tip for my tab, and when she saw she didn't receive a tip on one of the bills, she said \"wow, great tip\" and scoffed. Very disappointed, sad this place is no longer a go to.",

    "text": "From drinks, to appetizers, main course, and dessert... We had a great experience and my review moves from one star to three stars all the way up to five stars. Before posting this I checked with our group of five people and we all agree five stars for Chelsea's! Our highest recommendations go to the trout appetizer, the brussels sprouts salad, the fish of the day, and key lime pie. The service was impeccable. I am really happy that our experience was turned around so beautifully. MOVED MY REVIEW FROM 1 TO 3 STARS TODAY BECAUSE CHELSEA'S HANDLED THE BELOW COMPLAINT QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY BACK IN SEPTEMBER.  TONIGHT OUR GROUP RETURNS AND I WILL REVISE AGAIN AFTER DINNER.  WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO FINE DINING TONIGHT!  I just returned from dinner at Chelsea's kitchen. I was entertaining a group of five people and wanted to show them a great experience. We started out with appetizers and wine and everything was going well. We loved our corner table. All of the sudden a staff member named Natasha sweeps up to our table and asks if we would be willing to move in order to accommodate a gentleman's 80th birthday who is set on having our corner table. I was reluctant. It didn't feel right but everyone at the table wanted to accommodate this 80-year-old gentleman so we gladly moved to a smaller table.  We watched that corner table all night and an 80-year-old never appeared. The oldest person at that table was about 30. There were lots of exercise buffs and one young pregnant woman. No 80-year-old in sight  While the service at our new table was good, the waiter was cheery, and the food was good: This did not offset the fact that we felt duped by Natasha. Apparently someone slipped her enough money to make it worthwhile to uproot us. So that free first round of drinks and dessert did not offset the sour taste in our mouth from being duped. If Chelsea's would accept reservations so seating could be done in an orderly fashion it would be different. Instead someone like Natasha it is in a position to take advantage of us. Not appreciated.",

They did right there too.  Patio is recommended over inside, IMO, because it can be pretty loud being that dining patrons can see/hear all of the chefs clanging nearby. It's fun to watch, but loud.",

This is serious work and I gave my server grief that at LGO's sister restaurant in Santa Monica, (Misfit), they always assemble my food.   As far as I remember, the taco's are unique to this location.   Upon finishing the meal, I dutifully dragged my guest to the cookie plate which was EMPTY. OH NOOOO! It can't be!   Quickly, we alerted the Hostess who came back smiling with fresher cookies than the person got who wiped out all of the cookies. Ha!   One note: Apparently the space next to LGO (across the street) is going to be a new LGO Concept. Hopefully, I get an invitation to try this as I'll go back for food!

However, last Saturday while dining with 2 of my friends, it was chaos. We were seated indoors and in the center of the dining room when loud shouts interrupted our conversation. At first we thought it was an emergency, but was the staff kitchen personnel who arranges the food to the servers.  He continued these outbursts through our meal and it was just disturbing to us.  When our meals arrived my favorite crab cake eggs Benedict was just the regular eggs Benedict...disappointing. We all agreed that we did not want to wait for a correct dish to arrive and left as soon as we could.  Again, my first disappointing dining experience here, and hope this won't happen again.",

When we walked in they said there was a 25 min wait for inside seating so we headed to the bar to wait as the inside is very spacious. We got the white sangria pitcher which was a great deal compared to a single glass of it. It ended up only being 10 min and the place is very busy. We ordered the small plate of deviled eggs (eggcelent) and the chips with guac and salsa (both were amazing). My friend ordered coffee and it ended up being an organic French press which was a nice surprise. For lunch my friend got the Chelsea Cheeseburger which was cooked to perfection and I got the Ahi burger which was just ok but the waitress had advised me ahead of time it wasn't her recommendation. I substituted the fries for the vegetables which were AMAZING. For dessert we got the red velvet cake which was seriously to die for but I wish it was served with more gelato.  Overall the atmosphere was amazing and the service was impeccable. Would 100% come back again.",

Free valet is nice, but absolutely essential when it gets busy, which is most of the time unless you stroll in at 3 in the afternoon. Every server we've ever had has been pleasant and professional, and most of them are truly warm and friendly people.  Food is incredible. Super fresh ingredients. Have never had anything on the menu that wasn't spectacular.   Must try the short ribs, chilaquiles (brunch), and prime rib. The chicken nachos are amazing. Get an order of those to share and a pitcher of white wine sangria, and let the good times roll.  My wife and I were regulars at Chelsea's for years before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. As amazing as the restaurants are down here, I still wish that Chelsea's would open a location out here. It's one of the things we miss most about living in the Valley.",

Since it was just me I was able to walk up to the bar and find a seat right away.  I was greeted right away.    Since I was feeling a bit sick, I really wanted soup and all their soups are homemade daily.  I forgot the name but it was a chicken & rice soup with a broth base, so delicious.  My guy also recommended I get the kale salad.  The nice part is they will do half portions of all the salads.  I had that with the white meat chicken.  The salad had an amazing light dressing on it and I loved the addition on grapes to give it a different texture and flavor.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and very moist.  I wish I had more of an appetite because there were so many more things I would have liked to try.  They also had a really nice craft cocktail list.    I was also excited about the ambiance of this place.  I really liked sitting at the bar area that was connected to the outdoor seating area.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went a little too far yesterday. After a very late night, we decided to treat ourselves to brunch. We started off the only way you can: with a pitcher of sangria. That thing was large. Ridiculously large for two people. I swear, we each had four or five glasses and still hadn't reached the bottom. It was an endless supply.   Which leads me to this: ordering brunch buzzed is always a bad idea. I am not responsible for the amount of food ordered after drinking.  After my third glass of sangria, I ended up getting the brunch special, which was some kind of baked egg, pulled pork hash with homemade tortillas. That wasn't enough for me, though. Oh, no. I also had to get myself an $8 side of mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the prime rib and tried to finagle himself another mac & cheese, but luckily the waitress talked him out of it ... we don't need to die of a heart attack before noon.   When the food came it was like a little smorgasbord of heaven. Words were not spoken, only cooing and mmmm sounds for rest of the meal. When I finally paused to take a look around, the damage had been done. I ate myself sick. It was one of those: milk was a bad choice moments. It was hot and I had just eaten a ridiculous amount of melted cheese. By this time, I was sinking low in my seat while the boyfriend encouraged me to help him finish off that damn pitcher. I just couldn't do it. I gave up. Threw in the towel. The meal had won and I felt like that guy on Man vs. Food. I actually had to get a to-go box despite all the eating I'd done.   When I got home, I took a three hour nap.   That was some good eatin'.",

    "text": "I picked Chelsea's Kitchen for my birthday dinner, and it was a delightful experience from start to finish. We tried the short rib tacos, roasted jidori chicken, deviled eggs, trout dip, prickly pear margarita, white sangria, key lime pie and red velvet cake. Everything that we ordered was delicious! We came here on a weeknight around 5:30pm and were seated right away at the patio. Food arrived fairly quick for us, which we appreciated. The atmosphere was warm and lively. The service was so friendly, prompt and top notch even while it got more busy during our dinner. Thank you, Chelsea's Kitchen, for giving this first time visitor to Phoenix a wonderful dinner experience for her birthday! We will return next time we're in town.",

    "text": "Free cookie!!!!!  My wife and I decided to try Chelsea's Kitchen for our Sunday brunch date. I think we got there just in time since we didn't have to wait for a table.  I ordered a french pressed coffee soon as I got to the table. It was perfect to start my brunch.   Since we didn't have an idea on what to order, we just asked for recommendations. The server was so knowledgable of the menu. She gave us recommendations on every part of the menu. We decided to order tuna tartare & guacamole for starters, Chilaquiles and Short ribs for our entree.  The tartare & guacamole was big enough to share. The guacamole was placed on top of the tuna tartare. I would have wanted a little more seasoning on my guacamole and maybe a little bit of a kick. Maybe some chili peppers would do. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. I just had better tuna tartare and guacamole.  The short ribs at $20+ was tender, juicy and full of flavour. It was served on top of mashed potatoes and some grilled carrots. Again, it was around $20+... I can have the same good meal for $12 and still get the same satisfaction.  The chilaquiles was a different story. I think it's appropriately priced for the size and the flavour. I enjoyed the crunch of the corn tortilla, the balance of the chicken flavour and the compliment of the spicy sauce. It was original. At least it was the first time I had a mexican lasagna made with corn tortilla, chicken and spicy sauce.  Overall, Chelsea's kitchen had its pros and cons. The pros outweighs the cons. It may be pricey, it may have an ordinary menu but if you dig in just a little bit more... you might find some good food.  I will still come back to Chelsea's. Maybe next time i'll try the short ribs taco. The next table ordered it and it looked amazing.  By the way, they give free cookies on your way out. It was really good. Maybe the best thing I ate at Chelsea's that day were the cookies. Take note, THAT DAY. Maybe it would be different the next time I visit.  more reviews on  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthemealexperience.blogspot.com%2F&s=8867c350c7aa0cabf43cb9c6f3f4f024c3769b2d907a79470d966a0ba14180f9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">themealexperience.blogsp...</a>",

Chelsea's Kitchen is probably one of the most overrated places I've ever been.  I have no idea how so many people have given this place 5 stars.    I mean this place seriously sucks.  A $15 burger that looks like your buddy's dad made it on his old propane gas grill?  Covered in packaged American cheese and \"house made\" Russian dressing but it has Chelsea in its name so it must be great?  Maybe they meant the Claussen burger since the best part about it was the jarred grocery store pickles that were on it.  Really?  Just give me a Zipps burger and the fries will be better too.    Rest of the table got short rib tacos, steak tacos, paella special and another burger.  No one was impressed.    I've been to this kitchen twice, the first and the last time.  Do yourself a huge favor and skip the valet and keep driving down Camelback to somewhere else.",

House made cookies on the way out. We'll be back next time we're in town to try the green chili burger (and order more nachos). I should note that the service was excellent as well.",

Absolutely everything was done to perfection. I also ordered the Pinot noir, emeritus which was a perfect way to wash this meal down. We ended with key lime pie dessert  so yummy!

We waited inside and were in awe of the way they were running the kitchen and getting food out! So organized and precise and clean. The dishes were also being watched to see how long a plate would sit on the counter without being delivered to guests. It was amazing to see that they cared so much. Next, we were seated, looked over the menu, everything sounded amazing. Our waitress came by and we asked her what she recommended, she recommended some plates but said, \"if you let me know what you are in the mood for, I can help guide you down the menu.\" Such great customer service! We went with the Chelsea Bloody Mary and prickly Pear as drinks started with the deviled eggs and the Cornbread. SO GOOD. As entrees, we went with the Short Rib tacos, and the Santa Fe Eggs. No dish disappointed. HIGHLY recommend!",

We opted to sit on the front patio to avoid a 30 minute wait for the back patio.  We started the devil eggs & bottomless mimosas.  Our waitress was attentive, mimosas fill. All of the food was great for our party. The pancakes have an amazing lemon flavor that works perfectly with the maple. The fries has a great seasoning - the burger was good but I could live with just the fries.  I recommend the front patio - it's great for people watching the Scottsdale customers. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is prices. The prices are clearly set for the Scottsdale crowd with $24 Tacos. Our bill for 3 people was $96 which, even with mimosas is pretty spendy.",

I sat at the bar.  The seats are too big and difficult to get in to sit even when there are no patrons at the bar.  I ordered the Green Chili Burger. I asked for vegetables instead of fries.  The bar tender offered me some mix veggies with lentil, etc. I get the burger and the side is something completely different with cucumbers...I hate cucumbers!  So they bring me a fruit bowl...and it wasn't impressive! I would say it was a very small cup of strawberries (or should I say strawberry because there was one or two in the cup) and a dozen grapes. Technically it is a fruit cup!  The burger was not good at all, very average at best. The meat had too much char on it. For $14 bucks, I expect better than average. And it was a small burger too boot.  Heck, I'm still hungry!  I had a beer with the meal and was out $26 bucks with the tip!",

Thank goodness for the bar area 'cuz it  was way too hot outside (although it is charming).  Our lovely bartender, Monica, was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Short Rib Tacos and my hubby, the Green Chile Burger. His burger was a hair more done than his request of med. rare. Did not matter because it was super juicy.  It was a good size, tasty and just enough heat. The Fries were uber good. Not being a fries guy, I was surprised he ate half of them (I stole the other half - ha).  I really enjoyed my tacos. The short ribs were super tender and flavorful, but the portion was too large for me and I took the balance home. Lucky me. The homemade tortillas were warm and smokey. The ribs were so rich I needed to offset it with the homemade salsas, guac. and lettuce. So, good. Even the black beans over rice were creamy awesome. Any place that can get me to eat my beans is okay in my book.  I still made room for dessert. I had to keep it to a minimum and settled on the Grateful Spoon Pistachio Gelato. Delectable cold creamy goodness in 3 scoops. I have not heard of this brand, but I looked them up and they are located down the street from Chelsea's. I'll be paying them a visit another time.  A hair pricey, but well worth it. We'll be back for sure.",

I This, I learned, tastes like a hybrid of salmon and trout.  It's a more mild salmon flavor with the texture of trout.  It's grilled and served over some really fabulous mashed potatoes.  I ate it all.  I tried to eat just half but could not help myself.   For dessert I sampled the Chocolate Distruction and the Red Velvet cake. Lovely.   The bathroom was a walk away.  A walk down a very shiny and very slippery floor. No, I didn't fall, but the potential of a fall on some too high heels is great.  The bathroom is nice and clean, nothing fabulous.

Everyone is going to find something they like here.  FYI, the key lime pie is super good.",

    "text": "We dropped in here last night when we realized we didn't realistically have two hours + to wait at Pizzeria Bianco.   The wait here was about 40 minutes - which surprised me, for a Wednesday, but we persevered with a cocktail at the bar.   I immediately liked the setup -- it was comfortable, for lack of a more descriptive word. The fireplace was burning and the flowers sprung fresh from the vases that separated the dining room from the bar.   For some reason, the menu wasn't really doing it for me last night, which is abnormal, as I'm usually a big fan of comfort foods like fried chicken or spare ribs. So I went with a salad, which was good, not amazing, and it was brought out by my nicer-than-normal server.   We split a key lime pie at the end of the night which was also good but not quite there with the KL pie at Houston's, in my estimation.   All in all, very good.",

    "text": "So, I was missing New York City...especially that really cool farmhouse restaurant called Friend of a Farmer....anyhooo...  I was driven to this jaunt by some caring and concerned friends.  Here is the play by play experience... We pulled up and were valet parked for free.  We walked in after 8pm on a Friday on a holiday weekend and were immediately seated.  The booths are fabulously placed and private somehow.  Menus distributed it took seconds for Alison to offer us their famous white sangria which I winced a bit at because they do not have red sangria at all.  But you know I still indulged.  Then moments later a very HOT guys whose name I did not manage to get but whose profile I did capture, placed our beverages in front of us.  Clinking glasses we realized that having to save to go out instead of going out EVERY day could really be okay.  The economy a concern, we still found the place reasonably priced.  I mean, the cost of the Sangria pitcher was about $20 and that pitcher well satisfied us. Then, due to what was explained to us as having to deal with some \"interesting characters\", and only after one of us went to the host to solicit some attention, Alison...our missing server resurfaced.  She was apologetic and lovely.  Fearing that she might never return, we dumped all that we wanted on her at once...  The sashimi tuna, the shrimp esceviche, the mac and cheese, the rotisserie chicken, the swordfish tacos, and the soft-shell crabs were all drool-teasers listed that we simply had to try!  We even hinted early that the desert of Destruction by Chocolate and Red Velvet and Key Lime Pie might be victims and the CSI team could be tipped off that it would have been us that done it!  Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food, I let my eyes wander around the space that was created.  I excused myself from my friends to continue my search on foot.  I found a perfect oasis outside in the form of a delightful outdoor dining room which we had refused the offer to sit in upon arrival...clearly not knowing how wonderfully appointed this space would be.  There was a lovely fireplace, good intimate lighting, defined areas of conversation, and what appeared to be very attentive service.  I went to the ladies room and found that there was great style continued in there and the room was immaculate... really.  Returning to the table, I was greeted by the appetizers.  All was lovely.  To begin, the escheviche was perfectly marinated.  The tuna was so nice and fresh.  I really had to ask Alison where the tuna came from?  It was confirmed that the seafood is daily sent in from California and that nothing really just sits there...  This gave me hope since I am such a seafood lover and Arizona really has few waterfront opportunities.    The main dishes arrived timely and exceeded expectations.  The rotisserie chicken was so tender, seasoned without being over-done, juicy, and afloat a lovely risotto.  I can still taste it 12 hours later!  YUM. The mac and cheese was a white one but for me it was nothing special...It will please those who want a grown up mac and cheese without actually having any kick or  additional flavor to sort out.  It was a little bland but smooth and would compliment another dish that was full of flavor... I am not gonna lie.  That soft-shell crab was almost as good as being in LaCombe, Louisiana for the Blue Crab Festival!    The  swordfish tacos were adequately portioned and flavorful.  You will not go wrong with this option, especially if you plan on having room for the deserts I mentioned.  And yes, we had them.  They came with a scoop of Haagen Daaz in some cases so we just HAD to order them.  Definitely give this place a try.  It is good for double dates...I think.  Ask the table next to you when you get there...  I did.",

In N.Y. or L.A. valet parking makes sense to me (there is seldom a near-by parking place and you would be forced to walk blocks to park your car).  In Phoenix it makes no sense!  You are never more than 50 feet from the front door in any restaurant parking lot and in the case of Chelsea's Kitchen there's a ton of parking all over the place.  I don't like people driving my car and I object to having to pay an extra $3-5 bucks for something I am capable of doing (and prefer to do) myself.   Rich D.",

You could give them your car and watch them drive it 5 feet to park it in one of the spots in front of the door.  Or, you could suck it up and walk another 10 feet and park it yourself.

    "text": "As promised, thirty-five minutes after entering, at seven on a Tuesday night, with no reservation, in the summer, we were finally seated.  To say this place is crowded would be an understatement. Nowhere to sit at the bar, no place to loiter while waiting on a table. It was nuts to butts in there.  I did what anyone would do.  I went outside, plopped down on a concrete bench hoodged-up next to one of the high-tops where a typical American family was having dinner,mom, dad, teen daughter and son.  Mom was a typical forty-something, can't let go of her youth mom, bedazzled, tummy showing with overflow skinny jeans. She was bitching out her daughter.  Daughter was all; \"You don't even know Gretchen, how can you say she's a bad influence just because her tongue and nipples are pierced, you're so old fashioned! I want a tattoo.\"  Fat son spoke to no-one, he was busy playing video games on his phone. Totally disconnected. I look for him in a bell tower with an assault rifle in a few years.  Then there was forty-something dad: Mindlessly staring away from it all, furtively eyeballing the seemingly endless procession of tang arriving at the valet station... as if he was still a twenty-something poonslayer. Lustfully watching, drooling as they filed inside, their black mini's and f me pumps prominently on display. I'll bet he was probably thinking about how fucked his life is with these three winners.  Me? I just sat there drinking my Green Flash IPA, taking it all in, until the text came that our table was ready.   My salmon was 18 bucks and good, it came with kaleslaw, weird, but good too.  People of all ages here, mostly families.  Mostly dysfunctional families from what I witnessed.  Snagged about a dozen of the free cookies on the way out the door.  Forgot change for the valet. Paid him in chocolate chip cookies. Better than stiffing him.",

Handing a child a kids menu and letting them pick their own meal like the little person they are and giving them something to entertain them until food arives. This is part of what has made a few visits to Chelsea's Kitchen a True joy for me.   Staff has always been superb from greetings to goodbyes.   Food is always amazing beyond words. I've tried the tri tip tacos and the green chile burger and the nachos and the mac'n'cheese. You know I can't go somewhere and not try the mac'n'cheese. Be prepared to eat people. The Food is worth the price. Great heaping portions. Don't be afraid to ask for a to-go box!",

They come generously topped with fresh shredded chicken, silky melted white cheese, chunky guacamole, and sour cream. That appetizer is accompanied by a fantastic red salsa. Yum.   Another of our favorite entrees is the swordfish tacos. The fish is always tender and cooked to perfection. I love the homemade tortillas and kale salad too.   The service is always impeccable.

First of all the Margaritas are really really good. They make their own sweet and sour mix and it shows. Not too sweet, not too sour... just right.      We started off with chips and salsa and guac. Should have skipped this course as most of the items were repeated with the taco platters we ordered. Thought the chips were a bit dry and not salty enough. The salsa was different and interesting but certainly not memorable.       So why four stars? Loved the seared ahi tacos.  The ahi melts in your mouth and the homemade tortillas and guacamole coupled with this fabulous margarita? WoW. Partner ordered the short rib tacos and they were really good too but the ahi won out.  We will try the swordfish next time and start the meal with that fabulous quinoa kale salad that made us sing.     The service was exceptional. We will return and plan on giving a dinner out at Chelsea's Kitchen as a Christmas gift to make sure that happens!",

    "text": "Buy one entree get one for $4 - this was their brilliant July 4th promo. I hadn't been to Chelsea's in years - spent a nice New Years Eve there a few years back. Turns out Chelsea's is batting 1000 for holidays!   This time, we took a Yelp tip and walked to the bat cave as pre-dinner entertainment. Checking in for our 8:15 appointment shortly after 8 p.m., I got a little nervous when the hostess suggested we would be seated in 15-25 minutes - that they \"try to seat reservations within 15 minutes of their reservation time.\" We got seated promptly at 8:15.  I had remembered loving the ceviche and it was as delicious as I recalled.   Went with the fish special which was cooked perfectly and in a delicious simple Asian sauce. Believe it or not, I was given a list of ingredients when I asked for a recipe! How generous!  Unfortunately, they had run out of the Dixie chicken so one of my dinning companions had to settle for the rotisserie chicken which, while edible, was disappointingly dry.  I tasted a corn tortilla that was PERFECT! Had a nice stretch like a fresh flour tortilla but the hearty flavor unique to corn tortillas. While I didn't taste, I saw the lobster taco serving and was impressed with the portion.   Dessert was a flourless chocolate cake described precisely by our server as having the taste of \"brownie batter\" with pistachio gelato.   A single pitcher of house (white) sangria kept our table of 4 quenched.   The ambiance is homey yet elegant. I look forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Chelsea's is not a mom and pop shop who desperately needs our word of mouth to ensure their survival. They are in their own (lovely) stand-alone building complete with valet service for their private lot. The area is commercial and the local business crowd obviously loves this place, and with good reason.  Yelp was the driver for our lunch decision. We got there in the midst of the lunch rush and found the restaurant to be absolutely packed and the din pretty darn loud. I wondered for a moment if the noise itself wasn't going to be conducive to a group lunch but the throng of the crowd told me that the food was going to be worth it. I encouraged us to stay.  The wait wasn't crazy, 15-25 minutes for inside and immediate seating available on the front covered patio for those brave enough to deal with the heat. There is back patio seating with umbrellas but the hostess said it was simply too hot that day for it. Our group opted for front outside seating and we ultimately found that the ceiling fans and misters did do a good enough of a job to make it reasonably comfortable despite some long pants and long sleeved shirts in our group.  Wait staff was friendly, on it and helpful with recommendations and knowledge about the food. Portions are BIG - you'll be hard pressed to order an appetizer or salad for yourself and then go on to eat your sandwich and fries / other. Well you could, but most of us mortals would be sorry shortly thereafter.  Two of us split the brussel sprout salad - it was awesome! Bacon, manchengo cheese and almonds in a light vinegarette. Perfect for a hot day and frankly, just delish. I ended up going with a side for my main dish due to the portion sizes but I could not have made a better choice. If you are a mac n cheese lover, all I can say is welcome to paradise...this could and should, be your last meal. A beautiful bowl of perfectly done pasta with the creamiest, richest white cheese sauce imagineable. I don't know how I'm going to ever look at mac n cheese again...Chelsea...you've ruined me (thank you!)  Others in our party were nearly as enthusiastic as I about their dishes. The swordfish tacos were considered a complete win and the salmon special was cited to be \"excellent\". Clean plates said it all at the end - everyone left happy.  Tip - throw caution to the wind (so long as you have an alternate driver) and get the Shakin Lemonade. The Grey Goose Vokda and healthy sprig of rosemary will make any lunch meeting more fun...and two will put you into orbit. :)",

    "text": "What a wonderful little find here! I'm so jealous of people who live near Camelback Mountain, because that means this kitchen is only a small walk or drive away.  I started off my Sunday morning with one of their prickly pear infused tequila margaritas. I polished that off so quickly that they already had a 2nd one on its way to me only after being 15 minutes there.   From the name, chicken nachitos, you would expect a little appetizer on a saucer with little bites of chicken and a spoonful of guac and chips, but instead you get a huge platter filled with slow roasted shredded chicken, gallops of cheese, heaps of guac and some slices of jalepeno peppers.  Bryan and I shared plates of the swordfish tacos and of course, the short rib tacos - we had to try them since they're award winning, right? Both did not disappoint. They were great tasting and not overfilling since you could pace yourself easily with the small homemade corn tortillas they created. The tortillas were actually white, not yellow, in color and slightly browned and were a little smaller than a CD/DVD in size. It would probably take you about 3-4 little tortillas to finish all the meat on the taco plate. Each taco plate came with a mound of guacamole, a little saucer of salsa, and another mount of kale-quinoa mix that was delicious!   Eating kale and quinoa mixed together definitely was healthier than my usual rice obsession. I know there was dressing on the quinoa mix, but since quinoa tends to have protein in it and not just carbs, it just made me a little less guilt ridden fulfilling my need to eat my way into a Sunday morning food coma. I guess you could throw all that gibberish about healthy eating anyway because I forgot to mention that I also ordered the mac and cheese side... If you look up the word, \"Indulgence,\" in the dictionary, I am pretty sure there is a picture of this mac and cheese next to that word.   The service was okay. I think our waiter's mind was somewhere else, because he didn't check in on us enough. Bryan and his dad ordered coffee and our waiter said that he would refill those coffees and kept forgetting. We finally had to ask someone else to bring us another coffee pot. We said that we needed 2 boxes for separate left overs and he brought 1 box. These are just a few small things, but after reading all the other reviews, I thought the service would be great, so we were all a little disappointed about that. I'm sure he was just having an off day, because otherwise, the atmosphere was really nice. We sat indoors today, but on a late afternoon, it'd be nice to grab a few drinks and sit outside on the patio. It's too bad this place is so far away from me!",

    "text": "Having experienced such great food at the grocery and pizzeria a trip down 40th street to LGO Hospitality's proper restaurant - Chelsea's Kitchen - would prove to be much of the same and with brunch service starting at 9:30am I arrived just a few minutes after the doors opened to find the patio already partially filled as the warm sun and late October breeze filtered through the space.   A large restaurant with an enormous open kitchen, plenty of seating, and vastly more parking than the grocery I'd heard some mixed things about Chelsea's but with the same high standards of food, service, and setting I really enjoyed my visit - though perhaps not QUITE as much as my frequent stops down the street.  Hotcakes:  Having asked my server, Jenna, if I could order the children's hotcakes as a side dish to my main course I was instead offered the option of an individual cake for $2 (as opposed to the children's $6) and happy to take her up on the offer the hotcake turned out to be light, fluffy, and golden brown; perhaps not the most exciting option on the menu but a textbook example of how a pancake should be done - particularly when paired with high quality pure maple syrup.  Dixie Pan-Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Vegetables:  The main reason I visited Chelsea's on the day that I did was because I was going to noca for the Fried Chicken showdown that evening - what better way to prepare for fried chicken than with fried chicken?  With that noted, the comparison between the bird from Chelsea's and that of noca, fnb, or any other are a little bit difficult because of the style of preparation, but all things being equal what I really enjoyed about the chicken at Chelsea's was the moisture content of the meat and comparatively light breading overlying the well brined bird.  Crisp and savory with just a bit of spice further enhanced by the peppery potatoes this was down home comfort food - like the hotcakes nothing fancy, just well-made with superior ingredients, though I will say the mashed potatoes and vegetables could have used a bit more salt...and the chicken was even better with a drizzle of the leftover maple syrup from the hotcakes.  Red Velvet Cake with Butter Pecan Gelato from Grateful Spoon and Fresh Mint:  A thick slice of LGO's classic cake served with a scoop of butter pecan gelato from Grateful Spoon and a mint leaf - much like my meal at Lo-Lo's it wouldn't have seemed right to end a breakfast of fried chicken without a slice of red velvet and while I still prefer the version at Lo-Lo's overall it is only by the slimmest of margins and based entirely on a personal preference for a sweeter frosting, something La Grande Orange shies away from, instead focusing on the slightly sour notes to help temper the otherwise dense chocolate cake.  Six of one, half dozen of the other - and the gelato was excellent, though more butter than pecan, and definitely upping the dish's sweetness factor but a significant degree.  A great room and a lovely patio with professional service and fresh, natural, and delicious food I'm sure I'll find myself back a Chelsea's Kitchen soon - but likely not before a good dozen additional visits to the grocery and pizzeria.",

When I said that it would not fit us, she took us to a larger round table in the south east corner of the restaurant and threw the menus on the table.  The tables at Chelsea's have posts embedded in the concrete floor making them unmovable.  The food was Ok.  Service was OK.  Hostess very rude.  Will not go back again.

The goodnight emily (gin grapefruit and more) and the Guadalupe (herradura tequila and something yummy) were notable, and we ordered a 2nd round (rare). Bar staff, and waitress Kayla R. were really great. Also, free cookies on the way out the door! Will definitely be back the next time we're in Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

I have been here a couple of times and I go back because the food is delicious as I had the fish tacos, beef tacos and Ahi salad (salad was a little disappointing).  The prices are higher than your average restaurant in the area so be ready for $18 tacos.  Definitely a local favorite place in AZ!    What they don't tell you is you can get a free cookie on your way out the door.  So don't forget to grab one!",

    "text": "First and foremost, I can't believe it's taken me this long to come here. A friend and I came in for lunch yesterday...if that's what you want to call it. I'll call it grown up Sunday Funday. I say grown up because we were super classy and drank wine. So we order a bottle of the rose, we're sitting at the baron the outside enjoying the fine Sunday afternoon. The place is relatively busy considering it was that awkward time between lunch and dinner.   We ordered the deviled eggs. um. duh. Of course they were great. Kinda hard to eff up a boiled egg. But there's is real good - bacon on top. Anything with bacon on top is better. Well you know, after some girl gabbing and a few glasses of crisp wine, and some eggs, we just had to order another bottle of wine. The bartender was a gem. So attentive to our glasses - were never empty for more than a minute. She knew what she was doing that's for sure. Then we ordered the baked mac and cheese with bacon on top - so damn good. I might have been buzzed eating but that was some preeetttyyy good mac. And I know mac. I guess the reoccuring theme here is bacon and wine. I don't hate it.   There were these three douchey old men that insisted we scoot over so they could sit at the bar...he kept calling the bartender honey sugar or some name of endearment. I threw up in my mouth a bit.   The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there were like a billion flies. Okay, I get it, I was sitting outside, and they were doing their best with the high powered fans but that shit was still nasty. Flies in or around a restaurant is a big no no. Go get one of those blue zappy light things and exterminate those little fuckers cus I'm pretty sure one ALMOST landed on an egg and that would have been real gross. Flies throw up or poop or whatever every time they land. Yeah think about that. Real appetizing. I'm fairly positive I'll be back for plenty more grown up Sunday Fundays because that outside patio, sans flies, is the perfect little relaxing spot to get a good Sunday buzz.",

The waitress was RUDE! We sent back cornbread because it was cold and her comeback was \"well it was sitting there for awhile\" she could've just taken it back and sent her apologies, not a big deal. Got my food and it was cold, I didn't bother sending it back because I didn't want to wait. And I'm sorry, 12$ for chips?! Rip off. And she took 20 minutes to get our check and run it.  Overall, it's over priced. Food was cold and the waitress clearly had a bad day and took out on us. Probably won't be back.",

The egg was overdone, not runny at all and the meat was cold. I asked them to remake it and it came out tasting great. My date ordered the rotisserie chicken and was very underwhelmed. It was also cold. He ordered a white sangria which we both agreed was good. Then he ordered a pitcher of the sangria and we both agreed it was not as good or strong as the single glass.",

My only complaint is this: I ordered a Caesar salad, and when the waitress asked if I'd like to add shrimp, chicken, salmon, or swordfish I thought to myself \"swordfish sounds perfect\", so that's what I ordered. Now admittedly, I did not ask the price of the swordfish, figuring it can't be all that much, since the menu showed $7 for chicken and $8 for salmon in addition to the $14 for the salad; I had also noted that their seafood salad ( w/ crab & shrimp) was $18.  Boy, was I ever shocked to see my tab for the Caesar salad w/ swordfish ( water as a beverage) was $31; \"buyer beware\" and all that, but the waitress might have mentioned that the price of my salad would be doubled by adding the swordfish!!",

    "text": "Chelsea's Kitchen was on my \"Places to Try for Brunch\" list for a while.  Months ago, I ran across an article on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fazcentral.com&s=0fa138d42d30df740f042caa84e88be5225966540e697d3cd9db6caee611ba88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azcentral.com</a> that listed Chelsea Kitchen a must try place for brunch because they were offering unlimited mimosas for $12 on Saturdays.  Unfortunately, I never made it.  Sunday, 5 of us went to Chelsea's kitchen for brunch.  2 of my friends were there when I arrived, waiting patiently with mimosas.  They immediately told me ... bad news ... No more unlimited mimosas.  I wasn't too bummed out because I thought the unlimited mimosas deal was Saturdays only.  Once our server came over to take my drink order, I ordered a mimosa anyway.  She also told me immediately ... we no longer do unlimited mimosas.  Obviously, this was a big deal for patrons of Chelsea's Kitchen!  After all of us ordered one mimosa, one of my friends ordered a pitcher of Sangria.  The Sangria pitchers are made with white wine only.  There was a bit too much fruit in it for our liking.  It made the sangria VERY bitter, way too much lemon and orange. Another friend ordered a Bellini.  About 20 -30 minutes later the server came to bring us out food and we asked about the Bellini.  She informed us that the bar was a little backed up because it's prime brunch time. ... Understood!  She then also informed us that they do not serve Bellinis and she thought he ordered a Bloody Mary.  Huh?!  Bellini and Bloody Mary doesn't sound alike at all so we're not sure why she thought he said Bloody Mary but hey ....  On to the good part.  The food was out of this world good.  I ordered the short rib hash - Delicious!  Scrumptious from the first bite, however it was cold ...not cold as if the plate was in the refrigerator, but cold as in it sat back there in the kitchen for a while. Another friend ordered the chicken tacos.  He loved them.  Another friend ordered the Mexican chicken meal (I can't remember the name) but that dish was cold!  She let us try it, I stuck my fork into the very middle of her dish and for sure .. it was cold.  Another friend ordered his meal a la carte.  He ordered 3 eggs and 1 order of bacon.  What he received was 1 egg and 3 orders of bacon.  He has about 8 -10 pieces of bacon on his plate and 1 scrawny cold egg.  We mentioned this to the server and she said nope .. this is correct.  My short rib hash came with 2 eggs on top, the 2 eggs on top of my Short Rib Hash was more than the \"supposedly\" 2 eggs on his plate so we all knew this was wrong.  The server's defense \"Well if I were to cook 3 or 4 eggs at home it wouldn't look like this either\".  We all just looked at each other in confusion.  She offered to put in another order for 1 more egg but who in the heck is paying for another cold, very small egg.  Lastly, another friend ordered the prime rib with kale salad.  That was the only warm dish!  Honestly, the only warm one.   Although the flavors were really good, we still ate our food in disappointment because everything was cold and the service was bad.  I was the only one that's never been to Chelsea Kitchen so I didn't know what to expect but my friends have and they were super disappointed.  When we asked for our bill we noticed that my friend's receipt said \"2 eggs and 1 side of bacon\".  We knew damn well he didn't receive 3 eggs in the first place and instead of the server saying \"If I were to cook 3-4 eggs at home\" it wouldn't look like this\", she should have said \"Wow, you're right.  Let me check on this\".  That would have been greatly appreciated.   I'm giving Chelsea's Kitchen a 4 star review anyway because the food was so damn tasty ... everything was.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day. I'd like to try them again ... maybe for happy hour.",

I had the ahi tuna tacos and my friend had the brussel sprout salad. The ahi tuna tacos came with small corn tortillas and a very fresh kale and quinoa salad. The tacos were very, very good. The salad had a very light vinaigrette dressing which was very tasty. I'm no brussel sprout girl, but her salad looked might good and healthy too!  As for the parking -- there is a parking lot, but it gets filled fast. Park in valet and tip the guys generously then you won't have to worry about finding a spot. Trust me.  It's easy and they are FAST!   I plan on going back to try a brunch someday. Can't wait!",

I've always known Chelsea's Kitchen for great tacos and drinks.  Tonight I went for a glass of wine with my friend and she recommended we started with the French Deviled eggs.  Overall an excellent start!  The eggs were creamy meshed with some pickles and bacon that we added giving it some crunchy texture!  The paprika added an extra kick.  For our entrees and went for the tacos of course; short rib for sure with creamy guacamole!  The shorts ribs were smoky and braised to perfection with a nice subtle and not too strong BBQ sauce atop.  The kale salad was definitely a welcoming new texture and taste to my palate.    In the end, Chelsea's Kitchen is close to my heart because since moving here to the valley I've always known of the is place being consistent and being an awesome place for good eats.  They've never failed me and I don't see them doing so anytime soon.  Service is always tops and the place is very welcoming! - Enjoy!",

I also got a lemonade drink of some kind that was very good.  We went on a Tuesday but it was still very busy.... my salad came quick but the Nachitos took longer than I think they should have.  It was very loud and we all had to lean in to each other to hear what we were each saying but other than those couple things, nice classy place.",

    "text": "This place has been added to my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Very friendly and accommodating staff. I like everything from the look, to the feel, especially the food, and of course the smell of this place. Between everyone in the party we had half the dam menu on the table so we all shared a little so we could all try everything. On the menu itself they have lots of great dishes but I will tell you its all about the short rib meat or short rib taco platter. These short ribs are unreal, and definitely there go to item on the menu. You get a huge portion of meat! So smokey and freakin yum, that's all I can say. The special of the night is what I got. Halibut with a vanilla butter sauce and potato fennel puree. The sauce was so good. I noticed myself saying yum out-loud after every bite. Totally comin back soon. This place does breakfast and I will be checking it out. Two things I did not like. First the parking lot is small and 25% is self parking and 75% of it is what they call free valet, which is bull shit. Now if you don't want to walk to the parking garage under the building next to the restaurant you now have to tip a guy that gets your car that is no more then 50 feet away. I feel insulted and taking advantage of when I have to pay to park when I have to pay for the food that brought me here. I don't have to tip these valet guys is what the host tells me. I'm not that asshole but i wanted to be. The second thing was the dessert menu was limited and nothing stands out. So we passed and went elsewhere for that. So next time I cruz by and there is a open space in the free parking area I will dip in for some good eats!!!",

Brussell Sprout salad is tastey and a good way to start the meal.  Nothing jumped out at me on the menu so I went with the burger.  Was pretty good nothing special.  Decor is nice.  Outside patio and bar is really well done.   Maybe I'm down on the spot because they took away the off track betting?  Not sure if it's because I left AZ so long ago but the main reason I was disappointed is because of the price.  Better quality food in SF seems cheaper than Chelsea's kitchen.  Not sure why it is so expensive AZ.    Also, why the hell is there valet in Arizona?  There is a huge parking lot contigous with the restaraunt.  I know the valet parking is free but seriously.  I just had to get that off my chest.",

It was the first time in as long as I could remember that I perused a menu where literally EVERY selection appealed to me.  Needless to say, I had a hard time deciding, but when I did I landed on the tuna tartare app and the short rib tacos for my main.  Had I known the size of the app, I would've reconsidered.  Both the tuna and the tacos were excellent.  Service was fine, though not exceptional.  Atmosphere inside was lively.  Not sure how I missed Chelsea's Kitchen on my dozens of previous business trips to PHX, but glad I know about it now.  I'll be back - soon.",

Not impressed that at 5:30pm I had to valet, when I'm with the family, I'd just rather park and walk (needed to walk off the prime rib and wine anyways!).  This place is not cheap, and with $18 glasses of wine, there is no happy hour at the restaurant!",

I was surprised at all of the debris, pollen, and flies hanging out on the patio.  The food was good, but very overpriced for what you get.  They do let kids eat for free (not sure if it's every night or just the night we were there), and that was nice.  My kids loved the macaroni and cheese, french fries, and fruit that came out for them.  My husband's ahi tuna sandwich was \"decent\", according to him.  I had a caesar salad - nothing out of this world, but it wasn't awful, either.  There were a lot of people there drinking at the bar, so it's probably not the most kid friendly place. Our waitress was great, though.",

I also like the comfortable atmosphere here, on warm days and nights their patio is lovely, with a nice fireplace, those good white lights (not the god awful led ones), and a selection of items that will appeal to everyone.  They open earlier for brunch on Sundays than on Saturdays which we discovered one unfortunate Saturday after we had done a charity walk, and were starving only to discover that we had an hour to kill.  I had my heart set on those chilaquiles as well as some guac, so not even Vincent's market next store could quench that beast and we wound up getting nice and happy with a bottle of mimosas while we waited for Chelsea's to open.  A word to the wise, 2 people can eat off those taco plates and still take home leftovers (I'm also glad to see they took that uninspired white rice and beans off the plate and replaced it with kale salad!), and I never order dessert here when those scrumptious chocolate chip cookies with sea salt are taunting me as I walk out.  I know this is probably bad form, but I always grab at least 2.  I know.  I just can't help myself.",

The bar area was a great place to have a drink, and it is fairly lively.  If you can, sit on the outside part.  They have an amazing patio area.  Plus, they have one of my all time favorite beers (from when I lived in Oregon) on tap - Mirror Pond.  The service & food were great.  I had the Ahi Tuna Burger, and she had the veggie tacos.  Being a gentleman, I didn't eat her food, but she assured me via text message while writing this that the food was really good.  She also wanted to let you all know that they put sweet potato in the tacos, which was amazing.  (Now, I really wish I would have snuck a taco)  Anyway...  Prices were reasonable, and the whole restaurant has a great energy and vibe as well.  It is nice to see all sorts of different groups of people enjoying a night out.  Sometimes I feel all the people in a restaurant can look the exact same.  Go here & you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'm usually no fan of the grill (I tend to opt towards decadent pastas and sumptuous soups), but Chelsea's Kitchen always turns me into a T-rex eating every animal in sight.  The meats and carnivorious fares are absolutely delicious.  I'm a huge fan of everything with fish at Chelsea's.  For appetizer, I recommend the chips w/ tuna tartare and guacamole.  Not a fan of raw fish?  Well, first of all, you're missing out and lacking in taste--no offense.  But second of all, try just chips and guacamole.  So delicious!  For entree, I'm a huge fan of the ahi tuna burger.  The blend of flavors is absolutely incredible!  The swordfish and steak tacos are pretty delectable as well.  Finish your meal with a slice of red velvet cake (complete with a scoop of house-made gelato and a mint leaf) and a salted chocolate chip cookie on your way out.  However, you can't go wrong with any meal at Chelsea's.  I also highly recommend the Arnold Palmer--they say it's the same one as the Arnie at LGO, but I find Chelsea's Palmer to be much fresher and sweeter than it's counterpart down the street (or maybe it's just the juxtaposition between the general saltiness of the foods at Chelsea's and the inherent sweetness of tea and lemonade that makes it so particularly mouthwatering at CK).  But beware: Chelsea's does get pretty crowded on the weekend and even at dinnertime on weekdays, but the experience is well worth the wait.  If it's under 75 degrees, make sure to get a table on the inviting, intimate, and verdant patio.  If it's the typical 150 degree day, the cozy industrial-kitsch interior is fantastic as well.  Service is generally great and the servers are always extremely friendly and caring--however, they will subtly rush you if there's a wait, but the food and environment make up for any perceived rudeness you may experience.  Overall, Chelsea's is where I head to when I need to bulk up on protein.  Hope you have a yummy time at Chelsea's Kitchen!  Cheers!",

We sat indoors both times.  When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is popular, but I prefer indoor seating.  It feels comfortable sitting inside.  The way the tables and booths are set up it feels comfortable, and not crowded.  The spacing is just right.  During peak times, there is a full bar inside to relax while you wait for a table.  We started with tuna tartare, guacamole and chips.  It was a good choice.  We also ordered some beer.  The beer choices were limited.  The table next to us had a pitcher of sangria ... that looked like the better choice.  For dinner we had the short rib tacos and the ahi tuna.  My son had the kids meal mac and cheese.  I've had the short rib tacos both times I've been here, and it's outstanding.  The braised meat is tender, and served with corn tortillas, beans, guac, tomatoes, etc.  All of our meals were good, but the short rib tacos were the best.  For dessert we shared the red velvet cake.  It comes with a small scoop of vanila ice cream.  It could have come with a little more ice cream.  The cake was moist and not too sweet.  It was gone in a minute.    The bill for four including drinks and tip was $120.  On the way out, they have chocolate chip cookes with sea salt sprinkled on top.  A nice touch.  My son grabbed two cookies, and finished them on the drive back to the hotel.  Great dinner!",

    "text": "This is a phenomenal restaurant for any meal! I refer to it to the 'little black dress' of restaurants because it is impressive yet appropriate for ANY event or occasion (or non-occasion).   First of all the decor- the restaurant is comfortable and warm with lower lighting but not in an obnoxious way. At the same time it opens up so much that light comes in everywhere during the day. It is somewhat reminiscent of a steakhouse indoors but more modern and open. The bar is never considered a plan B as it's a prime seat to view the indoor and outdoor parts of the restaurant. You can see all the fresh herbs and fruits at the bar get muddled and used by the talented bar staff and view the kitchen plating which is prime entertainment. The back patio is surrounded by large bushes covered in gorgeous fuchsia flowers making it extremely private and vibrant in the day. At night they have candles and fire places which makes it romantic and beautiful.   The food - a versatile yet diverse menu. They use a smoker so the meat is all incredible. You can indulge in green Chile pork burger or or a Del Mar salad which is fresh, unique and absolutely delicious. Now this place also is a stand out because the spread is AMAZING breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their short rib hash is my favorite breakfast dish in the Phoenix area for example and they're kale and quinoa salad is my favorite salad in Phoenix. With their salads- you don't feel when ordering that you're sacrificing good taste when trying to be healthy. Highly recommend the swordfish tacos which are incredibly fresh too. They also have incredible sangrias i prefer red but they have both and i even love their white sangria equally. The service is second to none as well!   I've been coming here consistently for years and never get tired of it - would highly recommend for anyone, anytime and for ANY occasion- keep it up !",

    "text": "Yelping around after going to Cosanti, I found this gem. I wasn't expecting it to be so NICE, the pictures didn't do it justice.  When I pulled up I saw valet parking-for breakfast- and I thought wow, you're kidding!  But when I saw the Lamborghini and Bentley they'd parked I then thought, well, I'm sure out of my league for breakfast!  Bravely I kept on walking (I parked way in the back with my SUV) and saw an amazing looking patio I was determined to sit at on the beautiful spring morning.  They had an immediate opening outside, and I hopped up to the bar height table.   A very friendly young man came over, gave me a menu and told me about the specials. He grabbed me some water and took my order right away. He was very efficient.   I opted for a sort of huevos ranchera special-with home made tortillas (which I'm not supposed to have, but ate two in an orgy of deliciousness)   I sat enjoying the birds singing and flitting all over the trees, and I decided I had to come back here again - and the food was VERY good.   Eggs cooked perfect, and the pulled pork (they smoke it  themselves out front-check it out) was AMAZING. I ate till I was sooo stuffed (what's new??)  So, bring your Tesla (or regular old SUV) and enjoy a lovely meal-surrounded by nature.",

I came here for lunch the other day and I tried their surf & turf tacos. Steak was so juicy and tasty and shrimp was also cooked just right. Kale salad had nice texture and flavor. I really like their guacamole. Tacos come with a very small tortilla, four small ones are not enough to finish but they bring more if you request. So small my hands got messy trying to eat. It's a street taco size. Portion size is large enough that I couldn't save rooms for dessert. Too bad as I know their dessert here is pretty good too.  It gets pretty loud here and sometimes hard to hold conversation. You just have to speak louder, and everyone else speak louder too, lol.   Liking forward to more of their good food soon.",

Cornbread appetizer was cold, tasteless, chips and Guacamole were good. I ordered the Prime rib, it was also cold and tasteless. Mashed potatoes had shredded Kale infused, not sure why, no flavor, added sauce, butter etc either. Very bland meal, service was horrible had to get up and ask for water and more wine two separate times. Party ended up spending a little offer $550 on the total meal. Bottom line, it was a horrible experience, below average food and waste of money based on the restaurant competition in the area.",

We started with drinks and I was very impressed with their old fashioned, one of the best I've had in town. We followed this with our \"appetizer\" which was actually dessert, Key lime pie and some of the best strawberry gelato I've tested.  That's when I realized, for such a nice place, the portions were very generous! Next we had the devilled eggs that I enjoyed, they had some crunch to them which was a nice twist.  For main course I went with their special which was Brisket, cooked and seasoned perfectly. I savoured each and every bite, it was moist and wonderful. My friend had the nachos, which I would not order again but everything else was great and I look forward to returning.",

The white wine sangria was really good with plenty of apples and oranges.   We ordered the tuna tartare and guacamole with chips. The guac was very fresh and the tuna was a lil over powered with the ginger. For the entrees we got the LGO reserve short rib tacos, prime rib and LGO reserve rib eye steak. The corn with cheese vegetable mix as a side dish was definitely a high light. We scrapped our plates down to the last kernel with this dish. The short rib was slowly cooked and so well seasoned I totally forgot I got tortillas. I ate the ribs and kale straight from the plate.  Overall this place was just perfect. Even with late night service our waitress was great. Food overall is top notch. Every thing was well seasoned and had a lot of flavor. They definitely give you plenty in portion.",

It is a very popular event so the restaurant was very busy. There was a nice, very positive buzz in the restaurant's atmosphere but it was still cozy.  We both started with Martinis the way we liked them - no vermouth and very very cold.   For appetizers, we had the guacamole with hatch chili and grapefruit as well as the hatch chili corn bread. Both were very good!    For main courses, we both had the steak with hatch chilis. It was really good and tasty. We have never had anything quite like this before. We enjoyed it very much.   For desert, my wife had the key lime pie and I had the chocolate ice box cake with vanilla ice cream. Both were excellent !   Service was excellent in spite of the fact that it was very busy. Our server, Victoria, was very knowledgeable, attentive, and polite and did a great job explaining all the various and unique dishes. Very professional.  Overall, it was a great dinner ! We will definitely be back.",

We had an appetizer and entrees coming and were planning on the green chili desserts. There just wasn't room to share a table with strangers, nor did we want to. People wouldn't take no for an answer and literally sat down. I finally gave up and got a box and we left. I told the server about why we were hasty in our departure. She was apologetic. While I waited outside for our car she comped the check. I still wouldn't go back because of the regular crowd they attract.

The aroma was filtering through the air vents of my car and I knew something good was ahead.   The menu is well conceived and offers a broad range of delights sure to please any palette. Twyla's eyes lit up when the waiter announced GF Corn Bread (you won her heart right there). We both raved about the food and use of seasoning that made your mouth beg for more.  We opted to sit on the patio which was delightful at sunset. I can't say enough about our waiter who was the utmost professional, super personable and knows how to provide an experience; he was awesome!  The bar is warming and the open air aspect is one of my favorites. There is plenty of seating for large groups and the bartendars are fun.

I ordered the rotisserie rib eye and husband ordered the filet - both came with mash potatoes and veggies. Husband loved his dish! And well, I Loved my sides! The rib eye was very tender and juicy, but a tad bit bland. The filet def had more flavor/seasoning than my rib eye. Maybe it was because we showed up so close to close of business? Idk - I didn't finish my plate - it was a huge serving! :) I just took it home and will most likely doctor it up and eat it up! I'm really looking forward to the veggie though. If I remember correctly the waitress said it was asparagus, bok Choy, and a whole leek. It was just delish. :) our waitress was great! Very personable and made the night that much more pleasant.",

Our group of three swung by this spot on a Tuesday after our original plans fell through, and we called ahead to see if they had any tables open. They had one, and they so graciously held it for us since we were just a few minutes away. We were seated right when we got there as promised, and I could tell right away I was going to love the atmosphere!   I tried the white sangria and thought it was great. I wanted to order more cocktails but was trying to do that whole \"responsible\" thing. My eyes kept going straight to the Prickly Pear Margarita, so that's what I'll try next time.   Moving onto the food, the brussels sprouts salad with almonds, manchego cheese, and bacon is excellent, and perfect for sharing. I had to order the grilled swordfish tacos because a few people told me about them beforehand, and I'm so glad I did! The toppings were wonderful, and the kale slaw that came on the side is worthy of ten stars. So much flavor, and I felt good about getting a solid dose of greens in. What I loved most about my dinner was that most of it was so healthy - fresh veggies everywhere.   I would absolutely visit Chelsea's again. Another home run in Phoenix!",

In a nutshell.. -complimentary valet is offered -the decor was nice -the food was ok -the service was indifferent with no sense of urgency  Read on for details... -DECOR: I can't quite put my finger on the style, but with the wicker seats we sat in, the plantation shutter windows; and open air vibe especially with the outdoor patio I just felt like we somewhere tropical like Hawaii rather than in Arizona.    -FOOD: We ordered the DEVILED EGGS as an appetizer. The eggs arrived on a cute wooden board, each nestled in its own crevice. The extra ingredients used to dress up the deviled eggs were chives, bacon, and a bit of cayenne for heat.  The deviled eggs were yummy!   For our entrees, my friend had the SHORT RIB TACOS with a side of a kale and quinoa salad; guac; slasa; and made-to-order corn tortillos. I ordered the FRENCH DIP with fries. We placed our order with our server. After waiting for quite awhile for our food, our server finally brought it out to us.  My friend's tacos were yummy, especially the made-to-order corn tortillas. However my french dip was nothing to rave about. Our server must've been dancing while carrying my plate because the au jus sloshed onto my fries making them extra soggy AND the fries that missed the au jus bath were still limp because they weren't fully cooked -_-  The french bread wasn't fresh. Ieft my limp, soggy fries and huge chunks of stale bread on my plate.   -SERVICE: Me and my friend were busy chatting while waiting for our food but after awhile we noticed we had been waiting a bit longer than usual for our tacos and sandwich.  I also noticed other customers in our section, who had been seated and ordered before us, still had not received their food. One of the managers came out to talk to a few tables and appeared to apologize for the delay. At this point our server was hardly to be seen and not once approached us to explain for the long wait.  I flagged her down to ask how much longer our food would be. She clearly acted surprised as if we had just placed our order with her a second ago. She curtly replied \"it'll be out soon, your order is at the top of the list.\" We sat waiting for another 15 min before our orders finally came -_-  By this time there had to have been about a 30+ minute wait between the time we placed our entree orders to the time our food actually got to our table. My friend's tacos came with 3 small corn tortillas and when she asked our server for more, our server acted as if that was the most unreasonable request. She eventually brought  a stack of 10 tortillas and plopped down on our table. I was like WTF, why not give more upfront that way we could have avoided her rude and ungracious attitude?   I was very disappointed in my 1st visit here, both in my choice of dish and in the service.",

We then had the Chicken Nachitos, which were good - it was a huge, heaping portion of nachos that was a perfect way to start the meal.  It was fairly spicy which was a welcomed surprise.  My entree was the Curry Chicken Salad - they didn't overdue the curry powder and there wasn't too much mayo so it ended up being a good salad; I do have to say, however, that the portion was disappointing since it was fairly small.  The service was very good.    It was a nice day and we decided to sit outside, which was perfect for a day like that.  Not all the outdoor seating had shade, but I still thought it worked well.

    "text": "First thing you should know- THE PARKING.  Luckily I got there early enough before all the waiting for tables and being forced to use the valet parking. There's a handful of parking spots you can park in yourself if you're lucky.  I personally just am not a fan of valet parking. All the dudes running around frantically and adjusting my seat...Just nice, but no thanks. I came for brunch on a Sunday around 11 am and it wasn't terribly busy, but by the time I left the crowd waiting outside for a table was quite large. Sat on the patio, it's gorgeous...but the nature. There was this bird that kept swooping down and trying to eat food off the floor from the baby at the table next to mine and it was literally terrifying.  But the foooooood. My friend and I shared a large order of deviled eggs- UGH. Delicious. They're texturally interesting with a little crunch from pickle or something and bacon on top. Really. Just do it. I got the short rib hash which was a huge plate of crispy bits of tender short rib, potatoes, carrots, over easy eggs and an english muffin. It was great. But it needed a little more spice in my mind. Something spicy to bring it to the next level. My friend had eggs benedict and you can't really go wrong with that. Overall, we paid about $50 for brunch for two on a Sunday. A little pricey but the food and atmosphere was nice. Just not the best price point for breakfast for two college kids.",

    "text": "It's taken me forever to get to Chelsea's Kitchen, a restaurant I've been wanting to try for years! I went there this past weekend and was so happy to finally head to this beautiful eatery that has a breezy island vibe with sprawling patios both at the front of the house and back.  It's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for dinner at 9 p.m. on a Friday night -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy booths and striking printed curtains that make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The bar contained a few televisions with sporting events on, so you could dine in any type of atmosphere you wanted -- cozy dining room, spacious patio or at the bar.  Our servers were professional and attentive, and the meal was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took half of mine home. I loved the Lucy's \"Spiked\" Lemonade ($8) cocktail I got, with vodka, lemonade and fresh rosemary. It was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross alcohol taste -- it was easy to drink and tasty.  We started with the Guacamole and Chips ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the ingredients, including the chips and salsa, are all made in-house. The salsa had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the guacamole would have been great to eat on its own.  For my meal, I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian Burger ($12), which consisted of grains, nuts and seeds. I usually don't get French fries, but I did this time, and they had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of oil. The burger was tasty, but the consistency made it difficult to hold together. Not that it matters -- it was a great veggie burger that was really filling.  Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the service of the staff, who made you feel welcome and valued from start to finish. It's no wonder people remain so loyal to the eatery -- it seems like a wonderful place for anyone to have a great meal.",

I've tried almost everything on the menu (with my favorites being the short rib tacos, green chile burger, and veggie tacos), and love the complimentary salted chocolate chip cookie on the way out.  I'd say my ONLY gripe is that I do think it is mildly overpriced--HOWEVER I always, always get my money's worth. This spot is definitely a regular in my restaurant rotation. With their strong menu and friendly, accommodating staff, I definitely recommend Chelsea's.",

The only thing i didnt like was the soda in a can because I just don't like being served cans of soda at a restaurant. Especially when they charge 2.00 for the can.",

Although we did have a lady next to us who repeatedly complained about her food (steak missing a glaze she wanted) but of course she packed her leftovers to take it home. Odd.

I dined for lunch for the first time recently and had the Curry Chicken Salad. Its served very uniquely as chicken salad over mixed greens w/ a side of wonderful whole grain bread to make a sandwich if you choose.   They're rather famous for their soft tacos and new on the list are short rib tacos. Maaaan! They are scrumptious!!!  The dinner portion of short ribs served over mashed potatoes are melt in your mouth perfection! Cut them w/ a fork. Be warned, they serve this dish w/ an (optional) over easy egg on top.   The wine selection is pretty good and the deserts are sinful. Chelsea's is crowded almost every night of the week especially during tourist season.  That's definitely a good sign don't ya think?!

Once inside you think you are at a quaint cabin in Colorado . We sat outside on this adorable patio... Service was fast, efficient wait staff with great personalities. Our bar order was made to perfection... Appetizer: Smoked Trout spread, was an explosion to the taste buds... Awesome! Then came the Brussel Sprout salad we chose to add chicken... OMGosh, there are no words to describe how delicious it was, the chicken was smoked to perfection, then came dessert, real homemade pumpkin pie with Kalua whipped cream, no words to describe, add French press coffee to top it all off and you have the ending of a totally unforgettable lunch.... Can only imagine what dinner must be like!",

What disappointed me most about this restaurant was the service. All evening long we felt like our snooty waitress was not listening to us when we spoke. This was evident when the wrong appetizer was served to us and had to be sent back to the kitchen. Our water glasses remained empty all evening long, ketchup that was requested two times didn't arrive until after I was done eating, our plates, with food still on them, were cleared without our waitress asking if we were done with them, and our final bill was brought out to us without ever asking if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink.  Service was so quick I felt like I was eating at an Applebee's.  Considering the number of similar restaurants in the area, I won't be back. While it has almost nothing to do with the food, It's a shame because service is something that can certainly be corrected if its important to management.",

She immediately connected with me wanting to redeem this landmark on 40th Street just a tad North on Camelback.  This is rare, so my interest was piqued!  My friend Linda and I were going to eat somewhere that day and thought I would give Allison a ring.  She immediately asked if I wanted to have lunch that day (She must have heard my hunger pains!) and let me know the General Manager would be awaiting my arrival.  Linda and I entered Chelsea's and I had a new awakening, like it was a total new experience.  I desired to give them an opportunity so my slate and plate were clean!  FIRST, everyone there was the epitome of 'the Dove girl', which is refreshing!  Perfect posture, not a hair out of place, loving, caring, lovely posture, and more than hospitable.  We were greeted by the hostess who let us pick the seating for our next 2.5 hours of delight, then our 'water girl' named Susanne who was joyfully friendly and chatted with us some about more than water and lemons.  Then we were greeted by Erica, our server, letting me know the menu was open to whatever we desired for lunch due to my last experience there at Chelsea's.  I FELT SO LOVED!  My son had passed away a year ago this week, and I so desired this energy of being taken care of by these lovely women who could have been my daughters.  Linda and I ordered the wine from Santa Barbara, (very near and dear to me as I raised my boys up and down the California coast) and we actually had the carafe, 1 each :-) !  We then enjoyed the deviled eggs with bacon which melted in our mouths, then the 'salad' which I added a touch more salt and then the main event:  The Chelsea Cheeseburger!  OH, how i hungered for a lovely burger, once in a while is a requirement for me!  Well done, ordered to perfection, crisp onions, juicy pickles, yummy Wisconsin cheese, tender bun, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  They could hear my loving moans from the kitchen!  BECAUSE .....  After our main entre', the Executive Chef, Jorge Gomez, walked out smiling with a special desert and coffee (HOW DID THEY KNOW!!!).  He was a lovely guy, knowledgeable, precise, and in love with the love of good eats, both devouring and creating!    During our meal, the General Manager gazed over to make sure we were smiling, laughing and most of all, relishing in our lunch extravaganza; Chelsea style.  I NOW give Chelsea's Kitchen 5 STARS, and as a bonus 5 EXTRA GOLD STARS for directing me back, inviting me to partake in a quality long-lasting relationship with them after they showed me just what they are made of!  Dinner is right around the corner!  Maybe Chelsea's tonight!  Luana Joya Lucia",

    "text": "Went here for happy hour and an early dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday yesterday (Wednesday).  Happy hour is a VERY good deal.  I think it was half off drafts, $5 wines, and 4 or $5 wells.  Their wells were VERY nice stuff;  Herradura silver for tequila, Buffalo Trace for the bourbon.  We sat on the large patio in the back.  The weather was perfect, and the scenery was nice, although the trees were dropping a good deal of pollen.  People ordered a bunch of appetizers to share.  I remember the ceviche was nice, and the guac and salsa were quite good.  The salsa had a nice smokiness to it.  For dinner, I had the green chile burger, which I ordered medium-rare.  It came out overcooked, but it was still quite good.  One of my companions' burgers also came out overcooked.  I noted this to our server, and she apologized and took both burgers off of our tabs.  Excellent service.  I think my wife had the tuna sashimi tacos.  I tried some of the fish and it was good, but not really my thing.  After we finished up, we moved to the bar to clear our table for a party that had been waiting, and the manager bought us (five people left, at this point) a round on the house, in celebration of the birthday girl.  Very classy, nice gesture.  The old fashioned was excellent, quite possibly the best I've had in Arizona.  Great experience over all.  Good food and drinks, plenty of reasonably priced options if you don't want to splurge on an entree, which were in the $22-$33 range if I remember correctly.  The service was attentive and very professional, and the place seemed to be well-managed.  I warn that it did get quite busy by the time we finally left around 830, despite the fact that it was a Wednesday night.  In all, quite a nice restaurant with solid food and drink options and a great happy hour that runs until 6pm.  Very pleasant atmosphere out on the patio on a mild April evening.  Other than the overcooked burgers (to which the staff reacted appropriately), a perfect experience.  I will be back.",

My friends mom paid for about $80 of the tab in cash and they still ended up charging for those items in the final bill. The manager continued to argue with us and would not take responsibility for the restaurant's error and lack of respect. It took the server about 20-30 to check on us each time for water/wine. I will never ever go back there again and I will make sure to discourage other people I know to go there. It was my friend's bday and they made it into a stressful experience. I've never experienced such a lack of customer service and respect in a restaurant.",

The hostess couldnt have been nicer, service was ok. Ate on the patio- perfect evening and only a 15 minute wait. My mom and I split the swordfish tacos- AMAZING! The fish was delish, along with the guac, pico, and kale salad that came with it. My dad ordered the pork carnitas (spelling) and said it was the best pork hes ever had- that's a big statement to make! Needless to say, not a bite was left at our table. On the way out, the hostess gave us the most delicious sea salt chocolate chip cookie. Perfection. The only downside is the small parking lot and valet. We found a spot to park, but when leaving, the valet had blocked us into out spot w another car. Good thing I was still thinking about my delicious dinner to be too annoyed :)",

This place is a little expensive and while the food and drinks are good, it's still a bit too much. Now for super positive stuff:  The food is delicious! If you get the Chicken Nachitos make sure you share. This is a huge appetizer. My favorite app is by far the tune tartar with guacamole. Oh, yum! So fresh and delicious. For lunch or dinner, I love the swordfish tacos. I skip the tortillas and just have the swordfish and fixins on the kale salad...soooo good!!!  The drinks are also delicious! I always get the greyhound which is vodka with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. My husband orders the old fashion or bourbon with ginger ale.  I just noticed that they now have happy hour from 3-6 pm with $5 cocktails. This seems like a winning deal.  Oh, don't forget to take a fresh cookie on your way out.",

Their menu variety suits everyone's taste buds, the ambiance can't be beat, and their cocktails are fresh and fab. The prices are definitely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get!   This past visit, we ordered the shrimp ceviche to start and it was so fresh. The perfect starter because it doesn't fill you up too much! Next, my fiance and I split the Brussels sprout salad. YOU GUYS, this salad is a must. I can't get enough of it! Even if you're not a big fan of Brussels, you'll like this salad, I promise! For my entree, I got the rotisserie prime rib and it was cooked to perfection. I love the horseradish sauce that they serve on the side! Another entree winner is their short rib tacos! Last but not least, don't forget to grab one of their homemade salted chocolate chip cookies on the way out! TO. Die. For.  I know that we'll be back soon!

While I waited for my table I enjoyed a prickly pear margarita and a bite (or two!) of their salty chocolate chip cookies (a favorite of mine at LGO). The flavors were fantastic! I went with my family and they also ordered mimosas and iced tea.   We sat outside once we got our table. It was SUPER busy, but the service was still great and our waters never got below half empty. I ordered the short ribs - and all I have to say is WOW! I enjoyed every bite. It was cooked just right and I loved the guacamole it was served with.   Only disappointment was a lack of gluten free options for my family - my aunt and my boyfriend are both celiac, and they don't have the most GF-friendly kitchen (according to our waitress). However, they make all their tacos with corn tortillas, so that's definitely a doable option!",

The best part is the service- no the food- no the service- AHHH! You get the point. I love the manager Chris, the chef Bruce, and the pastry chef Jeannie. I have been there so many times that I wish I could buy stock in the place!  They treat me like a queen and I am no one. So that must mean they treat everyone like that. That's the way to do business.  All I can say is- GO! I have been there almost 4 dozen times and I feel like I should set up a cot.   This is also the PERFECT place to take people visiting from out of town because they will never have anything like it at home. If the weather is cooperating sit out on the patio. It is beautiful.    I love the DelMar salad, the Brussel Sprout salad, the french dip, and their seasoned fries are awesome! My son loves the ahi tuna burger and the red velvet cake. Our newest favorite is the short ribs. OMG. The short ribs. With the egg.  MMmmmMMmmm.   Try the key lime pie.  It was awesome. I  don't usually like pies like lemon meringue and key lime but my friend got it and I took a bite and then wanted one of my own!!! I recently tried their sangria too. It was DEEEELISH! Just give me a side of fruit please! ;-)  And I must mention the chocolate chip cookie plate on your way out the door. They are to die for. (Btw- the old recipe is better) The right combination of sweet and salty. You must try them to understand. Then you will PLOT how to take more than one, but still be polite, and not look like a slug for taking an entire stack of them. NOT kidding!",

I'm a huge fan of LGO and I also enjoy buck & rider but unfortunately, Chelsea's Kitchen did not represent very well. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere and the back patio is absolutely beautiful. Probably one of the nicest patios I've ever seen at a restaurant. Now, on to the food. Appetizers for the table included deviled eggs (with bacon, of course), ceviche, and tuna tartare. Deviled eggs were good. Ceviche was bad. Literally looked like a bowl of salsa with a few pieces of diced shrimp. Tuna tartare was good, tuna was really fresh and tasty but it was overwhelmed with the huge portion of guacamole on top. I never thought I would say this but that was too much guac!   Entrees:   Ribeye tacos were delicious. Steak was flavored beautifully.  Carne adovada: once again, really flavorful meat with a little kick.  Paella: Abysmal. Flavor was way off and I was not impressed with the meat and seafood inside of it.   Dessert:   Red velvet cake was very good. On the other hand, flourless chocolate cake was a disappointment.   Lastly, their coffee was fantastic! It's a French press coffee and it was so good. Overall, they did have some good dishes but not enough to impress me or make me want to come back any time soon.",

The earthy, wooden decor helped to create a serene atmosphere.  Our host, Blair, was genuinely friendly and attentive. At no point were we left feeling neglected. He recommended the vegan tacos to me, and I was not at all disappointed. The tacos alone warrant 10 out of 5 stars-they could convert at least 8 out of 10 meat-eaters to veganism, if not more. Mom loved her meal as well.  Will most definitely return to this enchanting kitchen.",

I highly recommend both if you've got fish or sushi lovers in your group! Normally I am trepidatious of raw tuna but it tasted fresh and had a great flavor. Their guac is fantastic too, obviously made freshly in-house.  I had the vegetarian tacos which are vegan. You don't have to be a vegan to enjoy (I am not a vegan but loved them). They felt healthy, fresh and not too filling. I didn't feel bloated and disgusting after eating everything on my plate.   Our waiter made great recommendations and let us try beer and green chile samples. If you can get a side of green chiles, I highly recommend it! Shout out to our waiter - I wish I remembered his name but if the owners are reading this, you should give the guy with facial hair who served the patio and worked on 9/9/19 a pat on the back. He was attentive but not overbearing and made great recommendations.   Nobody had anything negative to say. Sit on the patio if you can. It's a super cute place with a great atmosphere. Very much impressed with Chelsea's Kitchen and we will return!",

We sat out on the patio since the weather was nice and there was a nice breeze so it didn't feel hot.   We came during the brunch rush and so parking was full but they had complimentary valet so we didn't have to wait long to have our car parked.   The restaurant is nice and clean. I didn't care for the wix sticks for the kids to play some it was sticky. Would have like the traditional coloring page with the kids menu.   We ordered a couple appetizers to share. The shrimp cerviche had a nice amount of shrimp and I felt we had way more chips than needed. The deviled eggs were delicious since I couldn't taste the mustard which I can't stand. My ahi tuna sashimi salad was good. The ginger dressing was a nice pairing. I didn't like the sesame seeds soon the salad though. The kid's meals were a nice portion of a balance meal. The pancakes looked fluffy and my daughter devour them. The fruits were a good mix. We also ordered a kids Mac and cheese and that came with fries and fruits. The fries were done perfectly.   The rest of the people in my party enjoyed their meals and thought the portions were appropriate for the price.",

In the cooler months the patio and fireplaces can add delight to your date or family meal.  Short rib tacos are amazing as is the Southern Fried Chicken...you cannot go wrong here.

The high Yelp reviews reeled us in and now we're adding our own two cents to the mix!   From the overall vibe (rustic and cool!) to the varied menu, we were impressed from beginning to end. We started with chips and guacamole (free extra round of chips, if you need them like us!) and deviled eggs. All yummy! For my main meal, I had the daily soup (Green Chile Pork) paired with a brussel sprout salad.  I can eat soup yearlong regardless of the season and I loved this one - very hearty! My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf tacos - the tortillas are small, but he enjoyed nonetheless!   Tip: If you're an iced tea fan like me, try the green hibiscus! It's so refreshing and light.",

There was a 45 minute wait for a table inside (it's 102 outside) and of course we couldn't wait that long with toddlers.

We elected to sit on the patio since there were heaters.   Believe me, it was cold!  At least had to be down to 60 degrees!  Art was our server.   Very professional, friendly and competent.  I had the LGO reserve short rib tacos.  My companions had the prime rib, the salmon, and the special tacos of the day, which also had some sort of beef.  I don't like corn tortillas, but they don't have flour.  Art told me it was much better than that bought in the store since they are homemade and suggested I try them.   Uhhhmmmm, nope.   Still tasted like corn tortillas.  There was quite a serving of the meat, well spiced, not hot at all.   A good size serving of the guacamole and the salsa, both of which were quite tasty with the meat.   Accompanying it was a kale salad.   Not bad at all.  My companions roundly agreed everything they ordered was absolutely delish.    I will be back either for lunch or dinner.",

Unfortunately when I went there for Easter they were too busy and not paying attention to the food or service. Personally I do not like going to restaurants for holidays because of that reason. You get subpar service food and often feel rushed because they wanted turn the tables over. All in all this is a great spot to come for food and drinks with a great outdoor patio. If you've never been definitely come by and check it out",

They are know for the Chile cornbread - so don't forget to make room for this for your appetizer.    We sat outside near the fireplace so was a perfect balance to the chill in the air.  I had the special chili of the day; and hubby had swordfish tacos (yum). My daughter ordered the kids grilled cheese and fries and was thumbs up all around.   The patio is dog friendly, and the mimosas were free flowing on the Saturday brunch hour.  What more could you want?    By the way; I usually order the ahi tuna sandwich and it's always amazing- so definitely give it a try.  Their burgers are top rate as well.  They do offer valet parking so you don't have to deal with the mess; and service is quick and efficient",

On this visit we all shared the amazing chicken, pulled pork,prime rib sandwich, hamburger & fries, chicken & mashed potatoes and chicken,shrimp & rice dish. For dessert, we split a red velvet cake, and it was delicious. In fact, all the food was amazing.  We will definitely be returning here for dinner.",

The guacamole appetizer with about a half cup of guacamole and some salsa is $13. A ribeye taco platter with about 4 to 5 ounces of ribeye very thin ,sliced with about 2 tablespoons of guacamole and 2 tablespoons of salsa is $26. No beans no rice. It is served with a rather wretched kale slaw. A martini will cost you another $12 and with 20% tip and tax you are up to $68 per person! Seriously! $68 for a taco dinner and half a cup of guacamole! please! For $70 I can get a pretty darn good meal at a steakhouse with a real steak or even a lobster.... I would skip this place",

Just a little bland and not really anything to marvel over.  Chocolate nouveau cake. Wonderful. Tastes like a flourless chocolate cake or a really creamy/fudgey brownie.  Overall, I liked the presentation and the atmosphere. The service was great and everyone seemed very knowledgeable and professional. I just thought everything could use some more spice/flavor. It was too expensive for what it was, and I will probably not go back unless someone else chooses it.",

The wait was about 25 mins but it went by quickly and when finally seated I found the service to be good.   The food was good, not memorable but good. I had crispy chicken and my companion had the short rib tacos.  The chicken was prepared well and the rib tacos looked good as well.  I like Chelsea's Kitchen and would recommend it.",

I also was able to try the filet, which had a really good first bite, but strangely it lost  flavor by the end.   The reason I gave it 3 stars was because I didn't think the food was that great.

The Howie Burger and the Santa Fe burger were excellent...not a cheap burger but they are super tasty( Fries were awesome also)  The last time we went, we ordered just the Chicken Nachos and the Tuna Tartar....that was too much food for both of us.  We really liked the decor and are hoping to go again when the weather gets a little cool.  Tha patio looks like a nice place to hang out...  Haven't had a bad service experience. It was pretty busy each time we went...",

    "text": "I hate this place!!  The food is way too good; the by-the-glass wine list second to none in the valley, the eye candy is always enjoyable, the service anticipatory; the physical site - indoor and out - extremely pleasant; complimentary (and quick) valet parking; and - yes, the vaunted chocolate salted cookies on your way out.  Why do I hate it then?  It keeps drawing me back!  I am a \"luncher\" - generally later in the day, often near cocktail hour.  Over the years I've \"curated\" my list of 6-8 spots that have great food combined with an excellent by-the-glass wine list; generally visiting each once or twice every couple of weeks.  Chelsea's Kitchen, and its sister LGO restaurant just down the street - Buck & Rider - are supplanting all but one other.  This place has me hooked.  If you didn't know this was a LGO restaurant, a quick look at the wine list would be your first clue.  Excellent by-the-glass offerings at a variety of price ranges.  I can personally recommend the rose cremant, the Foxglove unoaked chardonnay, the Byron pinot, and the Madness and Cures sirah; I am not a fan of the Ironstone Cellar cab -  the Lodi vineyard, should have warned me away.  Larger group, or special occasion (?) - the Vineyard 29 cab ($80), and the Robert Craig Howell Mtn. zin ($75), both only available  by the bottle, are awesome choices, and priced about 2/3 of other valley wine lists.  And, if like me, you are a liquid dessert fan, and have a designated driver or are Ubering - a small measure of the Taylor Fladgate 10 year old tawny port is an awesome finisher.  Ask about wines that may be in stock, but not on the wine list.  Recently I discovered a Rombauer Chardonnay, only available by the bottle, and only until the current stock is depleted.  OK - important stuff out of the way; now for the food;  my favorites from the top of the menu are the deviled eggs with bacon (that's the midwestern in me); the California part favors the shrimp ceviche.  I could eat both the LGO caesar and the brussels sprouts salads as stand alone lunches but then I would miss out on the entrees; so if dining with someone both salads are enough for two as a entree precursor.  The Chelsea's cheeseburger (angus beef), sans bun and rare for me, is a satisfying and enjoyable lunch, especially when paired with a glass of the Byron pinot.  This past month I had the fish of the day which was grilled Idaho trout with the vegetable of the day - chargrilled brussels sprouts - paired with the Foxglove chard, and it was excellent.  On a previous occasion I had the prime rib, served with the obligatory side of horseradish sauce, paired with a glass of the Madness and Cures.  In an earlier reviewI had been critical as my idea of rare, and the chef's, appeared to differ; I like my rare mooing when I get it; the portion I received on that occassion was more medium rare.  Subsequently, I have had two \"mooing\" servings of the excellent prime rib.  The physical layout, along with the rear patio fireplace and ample bar seating - both indoor and out - is inviting and enjoyable.  If you sit on the patio be prepared for birds - lots of birds - chirping away; indoors the restaurant has a high noise level which encourages one to simply sit a bit closer to one's companion, assuming the dining occasion is appropriate for such.  This restaurant's location in the Biltmore area, along with its menu price points,  ensures that it attracts the local, well-heeled crowd, as evidenced by the cars in the parking lot, and the jewelry and accessories on the diners.  My companion on a December Friday evening cocktail hour visit asked me if I knew what all the men in the bar area had in common?  My response, after a moment of surveying, was that, like me - they were all with women 20 or more years younger.  After I recovered from the nasty elbow to the ribs I received; she commented that all the men were wearing Rolexes.  [I guess men and women notice different things.]  The restaurant appears often chaotic, however the service is not reflective of chaos.  Orders are taken when the diner is ready, drinks and food delivered promptly, food and wine pairing recommendations are made by servers who have obviously been trained to address such questions.   I had lunch at the bar recently, and bartender Kayla was able to provide anticipatory and superb service even with a busy bar area.    The General Manager - Natasha - reminds me of my pilot training many years ago; head on a swivel we were taught in yesteryear.  Watching her walk through the restaurant, head on a swivel, seeing all, one observes a True a professional in operation.  Be aware that the price points for this restaurant are inline with the neighborhood; excellent food and wines are fairly priced, expect $25 - $35 person for lunch; $35 - $50 per person for dinner; plus wine/cocktails.  {I recommend a minimum 25% gratuity for superb service such as I have received.}  Enjoy!!",

I love the Brussels sprout salad with chicken, and although it's nice to know its fresh chicken when it comes as half a rotisserie, I'd like it if they cut it off the body. It's easier to mix that way. The crispy chicken sandwich is good, but so big! The half soup half salad with chicken is a good deal because they are still very large portions. Ambiance is great here.

    "text": "Some things are just better when done outside, this includes dining on the great patio at Chelsea's Kitchen  During my visit I did not see Chelsea, if she is even real,  however I did see the kitchen and most importantly, I sat on the vine covered patio complete with a fireplace.  Our meal started  out with the seasonal specialty, a yellow tomato with 12 year old balsamic, goat cheese and sea salt ($10) This dish was decent, the tomato was firm however I would have liked to have had a bit more goat cheese. I always thought yellow tomatoes were not ripe yet, however this proved otherwise.  The ahi taco platter was too alluring to resist, keeping it somewhat healthy I opted for the veggies in lieu of the rice and beans. The high grade fish was seared perfectly, the guacamole was good as was the pico. The Veracruz veggies were just so so, as were the small handmade rough corn tortillas I was excited for.  Come in, enjoy the patio and the food.",

Inside, there's lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The booths are super big and comfortable.  Started with the deviled eggs, which were great. I had the veggie tacos, which came with an interesting mix of beans and greens in addition to tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and delish kale salad. The seasoning was so good and it was just a nice hearty lunch that didn't feel like it was a complete slap in my diet's face.  Husband had a burger, which he asked for medium rare but received medium. Not a big deal - it was moist and delicious. The accompanying fries were excellent and we ate ALL OF THEM.

Service is okay.  The first time I was here, I ordered the hot cakes which were not my favorite. Second time around I went with the short rib hash and it is to DIE FOR. If you can't decide what to choose on the menu, go with this one - it is bursting with flavors! Make sure to also try the coffee, the server will freshly press it right in front of you.

Dimly lit, an inviting bar with cumbersome but comfortable chairs, and if your lucky enough to have a gentleman stranger assist (yes there are still a few out there) then they are worth the effort to get into. We were lucky enough that the weather was perfect to enjoy eating an early evening dinner on the veranda. The atmosphere and friendly staff makes Chelsea's kitchen warm and inviting. I ordered the Ahi-tuna burger with a side of cooked kale that included butternut squash and red pepper pieces blended in. The kale's flavor was the loveliest blend of sweet and savory , so good that I at it first. The burger however was not the most pink or eye appealing , but still was a melt in your mouth tasty experience. I can't wait to return to soak up more of the ambiance, enjoy more of their menu, and taste those LGO cookie samples by the entrance. Chelsea's Kitchen you know how to make a girl swoon...",

Their guac is good but nothing special. The swordfish had a lot of flavor from the grill which was as promised!   The only annoying thing eating was the amount of flies, I know we're sitting with  a breeze because the doors are open, but geez those things got annoying!   The french sea salt chocolate chip cookies are worth stashing away in a doggie bag---- or simply buy a bag for $3.00 which we all did!!   Free valet always a plus!! Unheard of in DC.

I ordered the goodnight Emily cocktail and that was great.  It was a little sweeter than I anticipated but still a fun drink to start the night with!  We started off with the tuna tar tar, and while it was delicious, it was more like guacamole with a little tar tar at the bottom.  It was great but just not what was expected.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken after asking the waiter for his suggestion.  It was great chicken, it had great flavor and a little bit of a kick to it.  My only complaint about my meal experience was the service.  Our waiter was nice enough, but nothing spectacular. I love asking waiters what their favorite meals are, I hate when they respond with \"the most popular dish is...\" I want to hear what they truly like to eat when they pick their meals because they've usually tried everything on the menu.    Overall I had a great meal with friends and it was a fun experience. I would go back when I'm in the area but this wouldn't be a place I would specifically think to come on a regular night out.",

I normally don't like pork because it can be tough, but I was told they slow cook their meat for hours.  Our waitress, Preslee S, was the best. She was attentive, accommodating, and very kind.   Thanks Chelsea's Kitchen for ending our trip on a memorable note.",

She works hard with a constant smile on her face. Her knowledge of wine was some of the most impressive I've seen in the industry in a while. Second, THE FOOD! The steak tacos, Brussel sprout salad, and guacamole are some of the most delicious things I've ever eaten!! I had a cocktail before my meal and WOW were the ingredients fresh! Chelsea helped us select the perfect drinks for us and I couldn't have been more impressed! Can't wait to keep coming back here!",

The entrance seems quiet with a small water pond and serene statue. Once you cross the threshold into the restaurant there is a festive hustle and bustle in the restaurant that makes you want to partake.  The decor is welcoming and warm with an open concept. Plenty of windows and open patio draws you in. We opted to sit on the patio for our Sunday brunch at 10:30 am with beautiful weather. We were quickly seated and once outside, greeted with a heated patio, blazing fireplace and a million singing parakeets. If you don't like birds, this isn't for you.   Service is exemplary. Food is amazing. Coffee is fantastic. We ordered: Crab Cake Benedict - Great portion and abundant crab. Most places skimp, but not CKs. Mac N Cheese - Baked in a Le Creuset dish, it's amazing Kale Salad - Fresh, light, and feels just right. Chilequidas - Meh. Nothing to rave or brag about, if I came back, I would try something else. Coffee - French press Diet Coke - Canned.   All in all it was a great way to say farewell to Phoenix and simply the best meal of the trip. I'm glad we found CK. I'd recommend it to anyone dining in the Phoenix area. Good food. Great ambiance. Fabulous service. There isn't a reason not to dine here.",

It is also a known fact I enjoy a nice wine here and then.  (Shhh!) Insert extra cardio time.  And if you know me well enough, you know I moved to Phoenix for the following reasons:  - The nice views - The nice people  Everything I've just said is available in copious amounts at Chelsea's Kitchen.   A visit to Chelsea's Kitchen is always a treat. I had to re-write my review to (hopefully) reflect the adoration and fondness I have for this neighborhood staple.  Before I forget, let me start with my recent palate adventure. I enjoyed the BEST. BURGER I've Ever Eaten.   In my entire life.  No joke. If you haven't had the joy of savoring a \"Howie Burger\" you should stop, drop (whatever you're doing!) and hussle over there. ASAP.  Emily, our super awesome server, helped me narrow down which burger to dine on. She sold me with her prose and obvious delight in the Howie. Carmelized red onions, Havarti cheese and Dijon sauce played so well together in my mouth I had a moment. A long moment. My friends were just not there. (Sorry peeps. My food took precedence.)  Not only were the ingredients doing wonderful things to my tongue the burger truly was cooked rare. It fell apart in my mouth.  I just sighed as I wrote that. I may have to go back soon for another one.  Yes, every meal at Chelea's Kitchen is divine. They are plated with artistry and presented to the table with flare. The servers all know the story behind each dish and are prompt to attend to any need you have.   It doesn't matter who you encounter during your visit to Chelsea's Kitchen everyone offers the highest level of customer service. That means the hostess, the servers, the bartenders, the bussers, the kitchen and management.  There is no such thing as a bad seat. On a lazy day, if you so choose, you can look out on the canal.  If you feel like it, there's a wonderful patio. (Of course they have misters. That work and don't drown you.)  If the Phoenix Oven is in effect there is glass to protect the Dainty Humans.  Oh, and there is just so much air conditioning you should bring a sweater.  Yes, the wine here is amazing.  So is the sangria. So are the cocktails.  Of course you've heard about the sea salt cookies.   To be honest I've never made it to dessert.  I should probably plan a visit specifically around a sweet. But the main entrees are so good I've never made it that far!  This is the place to bring  - a date - a work colleague  - the family - out of town guests  And pretty much anyone you want to impress. Dress up, dress down, this place is for everyone. This is Arcadia. You will love it here.",

I came here with my boyfriend and our roomate + his gf.  She was visiting so we thought why not go to a fancy brunch?  We were sat promptly and I showed our waitress my e-comp.  We ordered our appetizer and sangria.  Sangria at 11am .. definately a splurge for us.  It was kind of the same as last time minus all the people.  They weren't packed this time but the service was REALLY slow, I say really slow this time because we came when it was open.. there weren't much people there.  Our server was very nice, we ordered ahi tuna guac, sangria, crab benedict, short rib hash, mac & cheese, and a burger.    Ahi guac- this was actually better last time, seemed to be too much guac and not enough tuna this time.  Still tastey none the less.  Sangria- awesome like always  Crab benedict- It was a bit on the heavy side but I'm assuming that the dish itself, hollandaise sauce + crab + eggs + bread = too much too fast.  Maybe if the hollandaise sauce was lighter?  Short rib hash- Again this was my order that turned out to be my least favorite one.  I had high expectations for this because the short rib tacos were so good last time.  However it was a dry disaster.  There were barely any potatos at the bottom and no flavor.  Am I always the unlucky one that gets the worse dish or is it that I have such high expectations? I'm not sure but everyone had a taste and they did not like it.. commenting it was too dry.    Mac & cheese-  If you were in heaven and there was mac & cheese on the menu they would be serving you Chelsea's kitchen's mac & cheese.  They had jalpenos pieces inside that gave it a little kick, AMAZING.    Burger- friend said it was like any other burger, not worth the price.    After reevaluating I would have given this place 2 stars, but the mac & cheese deserves a star of its own.  A place this beautiful makes you expect their food to be amazing.  They should really re-evaluate their head chef, whoever it is should be stepping up for a place this beautiful.   All in all I again I felt like the place was nothing over the top except the prices. I am all for paying top price for a great meal but the food really isn't worth the prices. Pretty hefty tab we racked up...even with the e-comp.",

They have valet parking, because it is a busy place. Here are some things to try: The burgers: made with fresh ground beef, you can feel safe in ordering a medium-rare burger (as they are meant to be cooked). They have versions of this depending on your taste, or your sense of adventure.  The tacos: wife likes fish, I like short ribs. Wife likes lettuce wraps, I like the tortillas. Brunch on Sunday: amazing eggs, and brunch dishes - and if you like mimosa - well, they seem to not run out of those. HAVE THE SUNDAY: really - it is made the proper way, you won't be sorry because you ate the kale salad - its all about balance.",

I found the food priced $3-$5 more than they should be for the quality and quantity.  For example, a burger was $13 and the bun was so thin that it was falling apart as I picked it up.  The Guacamole appetizer was $10.  Pretty pricey for guac.   When we sat down there was a used napkin left on the side of the seat that they failed to remove when they cleaned up (totally understandable, but unpleasant nonetheless).  I picked up my clean napkin and it had a hole in it. My lunch date's chicken was undercooked which they graciously took back and grilled a little longer, but not long enough.  The server brought us the check as soon as the plates were cleared and she never asked us if we wanted desert or anything else before the check came.   When we paid for lunch the server brought just 1 pen so I waited for my friend to sign and give me the pen, but the waitress came by too fast and grabbed the one signed receipt before I had a chance to sign mine.  I still left a good tip, but will likely not be back for a long long time.   pretty place, not worth the price and service, cookies upon exit were great though.",

    "text": "This place is awesome! What a great neighborhood restaurant.... it has a great atmosphere. The main dining area is completely open, same goes for the kitchen (you can see everyone cooking) with friendly waitstaff that were very expiedient!  It's a nice mix of casual and formal, with some people in dresses and others in jeans and t-shirts.  The place was packed when I was in there too. There's a nice patio with shade trees that looks out over the canal (gotta get your lake side views where you can in the desert!) and Vincent's.  I had the short rib with over-easy egg on top which is delicious!! Just a little bit different, but its soooo good. My boyfriend had the filet which was definitely bigger than most other restaurants for the price.  Very good ceviche, and they give you little sea-salt topped chocolate cookies as you leave.  This is a great restaurant that does things just differently enough, like all the LGO establishments, and provides great service.",

    "text": "One of my other favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  My absolute favorites are:  the tuna tartare, bbq seasoned fries, and the short rib tacos.  OMG, the short rib tacos are DELICIOUS!!! I definitely recommend that dish for anyone who haven't tried Chelsea's Kitchen.  It is my favorite!!!  Very cute restaurant, kind of a random location tucked away.  Definitely a mixed crowd and not your senior citizen restaurant that you get every where else in the Phoenix metro area.   They offer complimentary valet service, so it's great on nights when it's crowded!  Don't forget to get some cookies on your way out!",

I appreciated the outreach and was happy to share what details I could remember. Afterwards, they offered me a generous gift certificate and genuinely seemed to appreciate my feedback. A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal. My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous. It was a very busy night and we sat at the bar. Service was good and management came to follow-up with us to ask us about our meal when I used my certificate to pay for part of our meal. I was very impressed with Chelsea's efforts to listen to customer feedback and also their attempt to make their customers happy. I will return to Chelsea's and continue to love the guacamole tuna tartar!",

Love it for lunch, dinner, or drinking on the patio.  I have been here several times but this is my first review.  Service is always fantastic, it is a great place for kids (better without did I mention white sangria).  When it comes to what I like to eat, there are so many choices.  The nachos are my first favorite but you need a friend to share them with you or get as an appetizer for a group.  I suggest ordering them the \"old way\" which means with black beans on them.  I encourage you to find your favorite.  Ohhhhhhh, I almost forgot this place make fantastic soup, this day it was vegan squash.  Prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "I've been to Chelsea's half a dozen times or so, which is infrequent compared to my appearences at other places in the area.  Why, you ask?  1.  Parking.  It SUCKS and half the lot is blocked for valet, even on a Tuesday.  This being 2010, I use a debit card for most of my transactions.  I don't have cash to tip a valet.  I understand its a small lot for a place that busy, so take this complaint with a grain of salt. 2.  Some Pretentiousness.  Somehow Chelsea's didn't get the laid-back vibe of the other restaurants in their empire.  I went on a Tuesday last week, after work, a few minutes before my wife, who was coming from 24th/Camelback, and they wouldn't seat me.  Ever hear the phrase \"It's not what you say, its how you say it\"?  Well, the attitude with which I was told I wouldn't be seated literally ruined my dinner.  I've never punched anyone before, but I briefly considered it that Tuesday night.  And I think 2/3 of the crowd was lawyers just getting off work, dining with other lawyers, who still had that \"holier than thou\" attitude.  While waiting for my table this one fat guy bumped into me three different times without so much as an excuse me.  Its not like I jumped out at him - I was standing in the same spot for 15 minutes.  But I take comfort in the fact that he was obese and I am not.  The Good: 1.  They were extremely open to changes in the dishes.  BIG kudos for that. 2.  The food is great.  Some advice:  \"Medium\" salmon is equivalent to \"half-raw.\"  I now know to order it well done. 3.  The sell a 10 oz glass of wine.  4.  Cool spot, nice patio.",

    "text": "So, I've always liked Chelsea's Kitchen...I like all the LGO places. The decor is beautiful, the food is always good. And it was the same last night except for the one thing I can't get around - the horrible service. I usually feel that food trumps service, and as long as the place is nice and the food is good, I can deal. But the service last night prompted this review. We walked in and clearly there were tables, but we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Fine..they text you when your table is ready. But once seated, we had one waitress come to our table, we weren't ready to order drinks, so she put a folded piece of paper on the table mysteriously and walked away. Then a whole new waitress came over, no explanation. She seemed disappointed we decided not to have drinks. Appetizer came out with bacon on it, when we asked for it without. Then was somewhat rude when answering specific questions about entrees. Took away the plates without asking if we were done with our food, and then dropped the bill on the table without asking if we wanted dessert. Asked for some condiments - took forever getting to us. It seemed like she had made up her mind about us and then decided to not care about our table. Reaaaaallly disappointing. The food was good as always (entrees - 2 taco platters, one Del Mar salad and a Ahi tuna burger) and if we didn't have cocktails for that one time is that a reason to be rude and disappear? Not cool.",

It's possible that it was partially a result of my excitement over finally being on a short vacation, but this was one of the best lunches I've had in a while. We started with the  smoked trout dip, which I honestly wasn't expecting to like very much. Wow was I wrong! It was so good that when we ran out of crackers, my husband (embarrassingly enough) finished it with a spoon...I got a burger and my husband got a tuna burger. Both were great! Here's a tip though: even though the kale salad is great, if your dining companion orders the fries you will be jealous. Not quite sure what the seasoning was, but how can you not like seasoned fries?",

My sister and I decided to try it again.  I'm so thankful I tried it again.  This time we sat over to the right when we went in.  It's funny because we were sitting at the bar (our favorite place of all areas of a restaurant).  We thought we were looking at a mirror and then we realized we were looking at the other side of the bar that was outside.  We had to laugh.  I guess because I've always been seated at a table I didn't care for the place.  Now that I was at my prime spot it felt different.  We ended up ordering the \"Brussel sprout\" salad that was so amazing that I have worked in my kitchen to reproduce the salad.  I now have it down pat, but I'm now a huge fan of Chelsea's Kitchen that I will be back again, but nobody puts baby in a corner and I will be sitting at that bar where I should have been all along.

    "text": "Yessssss. I ate at Chelsea's Kitchen earlier this week and have been thinking about it ever since. Let me start by saying that I walk past this restaurant nearly every day, and the smell and pleasant din coming from the patio, along with the reviews from fellow Yelpers, had built up quite high expectations for my dinner there. And I wasn't let down! Yes it's pricey, but you know that walking in. Otherwise, we were greeted by a very pleasant hostess and shown right to our table (though it was early for dinner and definitely got busier as the night went on). The waiter recommended vegetarian options for me when I mentioned I don't eat meat. There is the house-made veggie burger and (seasonal) veggie tacos, but he also suggested the brussels sprouts salad sans bacon... so it's good to know they have no problem with exceptions on menu items.  I opted for the delicious burger with side of amazing fries! Who's ever had fries with sugar! and salt and a bit of spice? I never did til this dinner, but I now I vow to have them again! My date really enjoyed the halibut he ordered, which was healthy enough to allow him to go for dessert... Tammie Coe's red velvet cake. I don't get the red velvet fad, personally, but I tried this cake and it is so moist and the frosting so rich and creamy. For my dessert, I tried the warm chocolate cake, served with pistachio gelato. So. Good. The cake was like an airy fudgey brownie, with melted bits of chocolate oozing out.   The food was delicious, no doubt, but it tasted even better surrounded by warm, cheerful fires and the rich deep hues of the dining room.",

Inside, it was a busy lunch rush at noon, but we were seated in about 10 minutes.  The menu is small, but the choices are incredible.    Mom and I started with sharing the Brussel Sprout salad (which we thought would have marinated brussel sprouts - but was actual brussels pulled apart to make the \"lettuce\".  It was dressed in a smooth dressing with nuts, dried cranberries and blueberries, parmesean cheese sliced really thin.  Dad had the Del Mar Salad which was covered big chunks of crab and cut up shrimp.  The dressing was sort of tangy, very south of the border.  He said, \"This is the best salad I have ever had in my entire life!\"  WOW! Mom and Dad shared the French Dip.  Mom liked the seasoned fries, saying they weren't too salty/seasoned.  I had the Swordfish Tacos.  The swordfish was grilled and cut into pieces and served with pico de gallo, guacamole, small corn tortillas and a refreshing melon salad that was dressed with cilantro and lime juice ($16). The check comes on a square white plate that has an old fashioned check printed on it.  Mom picked up one for $15. On our way out, we were offered a soft chocolate chip cookie topped with sea salt.  I was really grossed out at the thought, but it was the best little sweet/salty treat I have ever eaten!  The salt just went really well with the sweetness of the cookie! Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food!  Looking forward to returning with the husband!",

The outside patio is great and the service is what it is, Its a good corporate lunch spot but stay away when it comes to dinner, its kinda boring, OH YEAH IF YOU DRIVE BY THIS PLACE THEY PUT SOME CRAZY TASTY SMELLS IN THE AIR SO BE STRONG AND KEEP DRIVING YOUR WALLET WILL THANK YOU.",

The food is consistently delicious, fun atmosphere, beautiful restaurant and great service, what else can you ask for? The pan-fried chicken with the sweet, cinnamon roll thing, are you kidding me? so good! The chips and guacamole is always a crowd pleaser.  If you go on the weekend prepare to wait but stop by the inside/outside bar and grab a margarita and it's all good. I don't usually get dessert but our party decided to split a few and the red velvet cake was to die for! Key Lime pie pretty darn delicious too! If you haven't been to Chelsea's stop what you're doing and go, now!",

I love the chipolte burger! The mac and cheese is definately something to write about don't miss out on the MAC! I also love that they serve the Passion fruit tea. This is very good food at a very good price. I have only had bad service once, I think our server was new or at least I hope she was. Otherwise she was just a ding bat that couldn't remember to come fill our drinks or bring the extras that we ordered. Don't keep this one a secret!",

    "text": "As return devotees to Chelsea's after moving back to the Valley, we were happy to come experience all that is the Chelsea's experience. The Kale Salad and fish tacos can be to \"live for\". The servers are off the charts as are the hostesses. So an \"A'\" for the above and a credit to Management for their skills in attracting and hiring A List Talents. Yet the rest is a flat out \"F\" !!! Chelsea's (on both our visits) has a serious issue with flies.  Serious!! As a refresher, flies  breed bacteria. Anything they hang around long enough is going to become infected. As they land on your food, they are leaving behind bacteria and who knows what else. And with Chelsea's Open kitchen, they are just as present and endemic on your food before it is served. Have you ever gone to throw your trash in the outside bins and  open the cover and there are what seems like hundreds of flies. They breed around garbage. The problem with that is when they are done with the garbage they can end up  infesting your food. Again, we really like the people here and the next day reached out to their GM Steve Whittaker and received no reply. Go figure.....",

Server knew his stuff, funny without being over the top.  Interesting menu choices that have a few surprises without getting silly or pretentious.  No pressure to flip the table, good dessert recommendation and no \"attitude\" when we wanted to share.  The patio makes the top of my list of Phoenix patios for ambiance and decoration.  Love it.  Going back.  Recommending to my friends.  Thanks!",

    "text": "I absolutley LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen! I can't believe I lived across the street from them for 8 months before eating their delicious-ness!  My fiance's brother and sister-in-law came over to our apartment and we were deciding on a place to eat and drink that wasn't too far so someone could still drive us home (we like to eat, drink and be merry). My future brother-in-law suggested Chelsea's Kitchen since it's literally across the street, obviously within walking distance, that way no one has to drive. So we trekked across the street and into a gorgeous restaurant.  It was a Friday night, but for some reason it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Our server was a tall, strawberry-blonde type that made the whole experience even better. I think at one point we even invited him to sit and have a drink with us. We started with a pitcher of the white sangria, which is made fresh daily (along with all their food), and soon found ourselves ordering another....and another. It was so refreshing on a hot summers night, we just couldn't resist. I ordered the Short Rib taco platter, which was absolutely to-die-for! The ribs were so tender, and the fresh homemade corn tortillas were perfect! The plate also comes with black beans and rice, guacamole, salsa fresca and sour creme. I couldn't even finish it all. We all ordered something different so that we could all try each others, but I honestly can't remember what my fiance, or my future brother and sister-in-law ordered. That probably has something to do with the large amounts of sangria I was drinking.  Anyway, we went back again just a few weeks ago and had the pleasure of sitting out on their back patio. I definitely suggest waiting for a seat out there. The ambiance they create with the trees and lighting is perfect for a date, or double-date night. We again started with a pitcher of the sangria at the bar while we waited for a table to open on this busier saturday evening. We were seated within the 20 minutes they promised and got the Brussels Sprout Salad to start off our eating pleasures. I'd never really like Brussels Sprouts and was hesitant at first to try it, but when it arrived at the table I was amazed at how green and fresh it looked that I couldn't help myself. That salad has raised the bar on my Brussels sprouts eating for sure!  We LOVE Chelsea's Kitchen and I definitely recommend you eat and drink and be merry here!",

The lobster was moist and tender and the tortillas were delicious and handmade! Yes it is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and it was well worth the few extra dollars.

    "text": "This is one of my very favorite places, for a special night or just any night.    Disclaimer:  There is often a wait, and the parking lot is small, so you might be stuck using the free valet - but it's totally worth it!    Beautifully cozy inside - big booths and tables, soft lighting, open floorplan.  Gorgeous patio outside, with big trees covered in little white lights.  Very romantic, but also fun for a group and a great, crowded bar for girls night.  The service has been pleasant every single time - no mean feat for so many visits.  I love this food!  The tuna tartare, served over guacamole, is amazing - I used to drive 25 minutes each way just to get this to go.  I highly recommend the ground ahi burger (so delicious!), the fish tacos, the fried chicken (\"amazing!!\" from multiple friends), the veggie tacos, the veggie burger...I'll stop before I've listed every item on the menu, but really, you can't go wrong.  The baked mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes are also to die for.  And don't even get me started on the desserts - keylime pie, red velvet cake, the list goes on.  Over the last ten years, I've probably been here with almost everyone I know.  It's a big favorite with visitors from the East Coast, and even my picky eaters can find something to love (Grandma requested plan chicken and mashed potatoes and had only nice things to say).",

Our pitcher of sangria was more than enough for the three of us to share, and our server Ryan had excellent suggestions and was very attentive. I finally decided on the baked mac and cheese and the short rib tacos. The mac and cheese was fabulous, and I would highly suggest it as an appetizer. The short rib tacos were unique and very well prepared, and the portion was generous enough that I still have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Overall, I had an amazing experience at Chelsea's Kitchen in Scottsdale. I felt well taken care of, and I look forward to returning to this restaurant in the near future. Five stars!",

The only complaint is that the seats were a bit uncomfortable but the environment was great, trendy, yet easy- going.  Our waitress Emily was so accommodating, there was a request for a burger, sub chicken, this was not on the menu but she did ask the chef and was able to make the special order and I was told the chicken burger was a 10!   The fries- seriously a 10 star plate of fries! The seasoning was salty and sweet, the waitress said t was a mix of brown sugar, paprika, garlic salt, pepper, SO SO GOOD!!   I had the veggie Burger. It was ok.  I would def go back. They have an overwhelming, in a good way, menu that makes you want to go back and try more!!  also had the peanut butter chunk gelato= amazing!!!!!! All peanut butter lovers should try it",

I was not upset with the frequent arrival of a new pitcher throughout our meal.   I was pretty impressed with the crab cake Benedict. The crab cake was pretty much all meat, so that was a pleasant surprise. I am pretty obsessed with Benedict's as of late, so I feel like there couldn't be much that went wrong. It came with fresh fruit and it was definitely fresh. A couple of my friends got the green chili burger. My sister told me not to long ago that that is the best burger she has had in her life... sooooo... I will be making a trip back to Chelsea's in the very near future.   Aside from the drinks and food be amazing, the wait staff was STELLAR! Like I said before, they never forgot to replenish the mimosas of our table of 8. Out waitress was nothing short of the unbelievably kind. She kept saying how great, wonderful, and polite we were (that is something I have never heard someone say about my group of friends and I). Needless to say, it was a great experience!",

A good amount of fish and meats.  I had the ahi tuna tacos. The tuna was cooked rare, and was delicious. No fishy smell or taste.   Drink: 4 drafts, craft/import, all out of the ordinary, which is good. Several wines. Full bar for mixed drinks.  Service: excellent. The server was quick, attentive, knowledgeable, accurate, and talkative enough to make the experience enjoyable.   Price: slightly pricey, but you get what you pay for.   Additional note: one guest had 2 golden labs with them on the patio. They were well behaved. I assume the staff saw them and were cool with it. This is a plus if you are a dog owner.",

Yes I'm cheap I hate to pay before I've even gotten in the front door. The good news is they don't charge you when there are no regular spaces so I was ok.  We sat inside and I really liked the atmosphere from the get go.  Very upbeat and the place was pretty packed for a weeknight.  The menu looked good with many selections.  My friend go the ribs and I had the aji tacos and the other woman with us had the veggie tacos.  My plate normally comes with either black beans or fermented veggies.  I kind of could not decide so I had them give me both of them.  I liked the presentation of everything, The tortillas are really good and the only problem is they give one plate for two hungry people.  We had to ask for a couple more plates they were so good.  Everything tasted great and I thought the wait person was super nice and friendly.  There was a cute little baby at the table behind us that made everyone smile.  It is a little loud but not too bad.  It is definitely a good date spot. Overall a fun time",

Any taco option is great, the veggie burger is tasty and the fries are tops.  Service with the hostesses can be lacking. Reservations are not typical here. Making a reservation means you get \"preferred seating\" but are still on the wait list. This means you may very-well end up waiting 45-60 minutes during a rush even with a reservation. Also, I get the feeling that the hostesses skip over less-vocal people waiting.  It is still one of our favorite places, we just plan on a little extra wait.",

Of course the cookies at exit are something we always look forward to ending our meals with.  Panic ensues if they ever look like they are going out of them!!!  My complaint (and I will be in the minority here according to reviews), is Chelsea Kitchen's coffee.  The presentation is great with the French press, but the coffee is always weak and we find the flavor not good at all (this is over the past few years we have been going).  Sadly, this is a deterrent for us when we think of breakfast or brunch places because of our consistently bad experience with their coffee.  So many other great places in town that serve amazing coffee. : (",

Everything on the plate was delicious: the meat, slaw, salsa, tortillas, guacamole...I keep dreaming about how perfectly the slaw paired with the short rib meat. My husband ordered a special that night which was beef brisket from their smoke yard with the colcannon potatoes and he licked his plate clean.   Our only complaint was the slow service. It took a while for our waiter to show up at our table, return to take our order, and deliver the bill. He also made a rude comment when I asked for another glass of water. It was really bizarre and kind of stunned us. But he just seemed like he was in a bad mood from the start.   Anyway, order the corn bread!",

She kept hitting on my girlfriend's brother, told him how handsome he was, etc. I'm not sure if she thought he was paying the bill, and she was trying to get a bigger tip by complimenting him, but it made our experience rather awkward. We were trying to enjoy our meal in peace, but Sara kept coming up to our table to check in on my girlfriend's brother. She pretty much ignored my girlfriend and I the entire time. I just expected more professionalism from a server employed at a restaurant that has been a go to spot for us for a while. I'll come back, but I'll politely request a different server than Sara",

A word of caution about the drinks. Apparently someone thought that creating an ice cube nearly the size of the glass would not only be a real money maker and not be noticed by the customer. Wrong. I noticed it at once and pulled the huge cube out the glass and was left with about 1\" of vodka and gimlet mix. Wish I would have take a picture of it. When I asked the server she said the was a normal poor for Chelsea's. All that for $13.00. Really? I'll probably be back again but will definitely not order liquor here.",

Next I ordered the Chiqueles on the brunch menu and this hit the spot. It is basically a layered casserole dish for breakfast including an egg on top with chicken cheese and much more in the middle. This was the most satisfying delicious dish I have had after a night of drinking . I can't describe how amazing it tasted only that I will be craving this later in the near future. It was very nice to be treated this well at a restaurant from start to finish. Come check it out for yourself it is a five star experience!",

We ordered. I had the French dip. More on that later. After ordering I also asked for a bowl of soup. It also came quickly. The soup was French onion, really bland, no baked cheese on top, and not much of it. Then came the sandwich. Cold. Fries were cold too. I didn't send it back because the place is a favorite of a colleague asking with us. So I sat there eating cold fries and a cold sandwich dipping into the jus, also bland. Oh well, maybe they serve warm salads.",

The place is great, the patio is awesome and the service couldn't be better. Too bad I didn't ask the waitress her name because I should send a compliment to the place about the great service :)  So I ordered a tea (I know, it sounds weird but I was sick). The tea was tasteful and the serving was generous.   After warming up with the tea and taming my upset stomach, I ordered the filet and the house pinot noir.   Both were pretty good.  The mountain of mashed potatoes could be smaller and on the side, instead of under the filet and I didn't try the veggies. But all in all it was a great experience.  Did I say how awesome the waitress was? I'll have to go back sooner than later!",

The atmosphere is wonderful inside and out and sitting by the fire in the wintertime is lovely. We have been coming to Chelsea's kitchen for over 10 years and some of my favorite dishes are the short rib tacos, Dixie's pan fried chicken, jidori chicken, and Ethan's vegetarian tacos. And for dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is absolutely out of this world. But unfortunately, the chocolate cake has been discontinued, and for some reason and the red velvet remains. This, to me, is a mystery. When friends visit from out of town we always come to Chelsea's kitchen and I rave about the food, the service, and the chocolate cake. For me, the flourless chocolate cake has always been the perfect ending to a perfect meal. In the future, I hope the chocolate cake returns so I may again enjoy a perfect meal in a perfect place!",

I mean the meat was so cooked it powdered when touched.  Burnt to a cinder comes to mind.  The last few times our food has either been overcooked or undercooked.  We are going to give the place a break for a while until they change back the managers or whatever is going on...",

    "text": "We were doing a stay-cation at the Biltmore and decided to partake in some of the finer culinary treasures of Phoenix. To that end we had heard a lot about Chelsea's kitchen and decided to go on July 4th for dinner. The restaurant was offering a $4 dollar 2nd entree special so why not.  I had read some of the other comments and I see these comments all over other restaurants about being expensive and complaining about valet parking. You're not in Kansas anymore. Phoenix has become a major metropolitan area and if you want good ingredients you're going to pay a premium and as for valet parking welcome to the big city.  All that being said the restaurant was very busy for a holiday and many for the staff said they were not expecting the volume that they had. Looks like more of us are boycotting California these days. We took seat on the patio and enjoyed some wonder white sangria. This was perfectly balanced and I would recommend it if you're looking for something a little lighter in your alcoholic libations.  Were seated in about 25 min which as less than the 45minues we were told to expect. While the wait staff was extremely pleasant they were a little overwhelmed and the level of attentiveness could have been just a touch more during the dining experience.  We ordered the chicken nachito's to start. A note to those that order..Nachtios inferred to me small but this is a huge plate of nachos. This dish was so close to being stellar that it was sinful but missed the mark for a couple of reasons. The chips were fabulous as was the guac, however the there wasn't enough cheese on top and after we dug through we saw a huge mound of shredded and unmelted cheese. Maybe that was the intent. The chicken was bland and could have sued a little spice to perk things up. If they had done those two things this dish would have rocked the Kasbah.  We next ordered the Brussels sprout salad. I mean who gets brussel sprout salad. Te salad was a large portion and had beautiful texture with blue berries, cranberries, manchengo cheese, and some nuts. Brussel sprouts are not the lightest flavor in the house and when paired with the solidness of the manchengo cheese it needs a dressing to hold up. I know the chef was going for lighter fare in the salad as a whole but the dressing was a little limp in the flavor department compared with the stoutness of brussel sprouts and the cheese as well as the texture in the salad. Perhaps a creamy cumber or Dijon based dressing would have fared better but something a little more solid and this salad would have moved into the greatness department.  My wife ordered the Lobster tacos and I ordered the short ribs we wanted to sample the fries and the Mac and cheese (we sample a lot of everything and leave tons).  The short ribs were stellar and the portion for short ribs was the largest I have seen at any restaurant. You have the option of ordering an egg sunny side up on your ribs and I did just that and it was awesome. The lobster tacos were stellar and the fabulous guac they serve was a great compliment. I saw one reviewer had a little disdain for the corn tortillas. I have to agree. There was something just off about these corn tortillas. I believe he said they added flour to them. That could be.  East Coasters would never know the difference but to those of us that relish our Mexican food there was something not right about these corn tortillas even though they were fresh..Not bad mind you, but slightly off.  The fries were very good (hand cut) and the Mac n Cheese was a solid side. The restaurant does have a great patio and I would go back again.  Chelsea's Kitchen was close to greatness, but I alas I can only give three stars. A few tweaks and they move up at lightning speed.",

BUT, when it comes to their actual menu and food, its only a C for me. Their chicken nachos? Save your $14. They give you a ton of chips but lacked cheese and chicken so you can't really call these nachos.   Their Ahi Tuna Burger - this is not a flank piece of ahi. Instead, its ground up ahi tuna meat mixed with fillers to create a patty.  Probably the best thing i had was their Kale Salad, but that's not enough to draw me back here. Save your money and go somewhere else, and make your own sea salt choc chip cookies.",

It was my first time at Chelsea's and it didn't disappoint. I had Chilaquiles and ordered the egg scrambled instead of over-easy.  This was one of the most delicious breakfasts i've had in some time! Eggs cooked perfectly, the red and green sauces were excellent... I gave the bf a bite or two, but i ate pretty much every morsel on the plate. I had a bloody mary, which was good, but i prefer a little spicier. He had some kind of pancake breakfast. I had a bite and it was good, but mine was waayyy better.  =) I look forward to trying some of their lunch or dinner options!!",

The parking lot was full so we thought we would wait forever for a table.. Wrong we got right in!! I had the Brussel Sprout salad and can't stop craving it now that we are home.  The best part of our whole experience was ordering some Red Velvet cake and giving Christina our waitress our gender reveal envelope to tell us the sex of our soon to be baby!!  When it was time for the \"reveal\" most of the staff was gathered around our table to check out our reaction! It was so amazing to be surrounded by the nicest staff ever!!! The chef came over and said it was a first for him, I'm so glad my husband and I could be trend setters and have this amazing memory from vacation.  If we ever get back to AZ Chelsea's Kitchen will be a must stop with our baby girl! :)",

Though they were already very busy at only 530, the service was quick and friendly and our food came very fast.   We decided to split the Brussels sprout salad and the short rib tacos.  We were both very excited for the salad, we are both huge Brussels sprouts people. However it fell very short. It would have been a million times better if they served it warm and the Brussels sprouts slightly sauteed. Instead its just a pile of cold chopped up Brussels sprouts and very spars bacon and almonds with 2 slivers of cheese. wah wah.  The short rib tacos were the STAR of the meal and a total meal saver! These were absolutely outstanding says the girl who is not a fan of ribs. I honestly can not stop thinking about them! The flour tortillas that come with are made fresh and you can taste it. It would be helpful if the tortillas were about an inch bigger, but that's my only complaint.   I seriously will only ever get these taco for as long as I go to Chelseas! So yum!   the atmosphere here is very nice. I love all the over sized lamps and flower arrangements. The bathrooms are nice and clean. The booth we were in was a bit saggy and could stand to be a bit firmer, but thats minor.   Keep it up Chelsea's!",

After some wonderful suggestions I went with the GRILLED AHI TUNA taco plate. The fish was seared to perfection with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos came with hand made tortillas, spicy aioli sauce, fresh guacamole and chipotle salsa. I topped it all off with a fantastic margarita.  This is my new favorite place!",

But I'll wait until fall =).    About the food, it was very good, no complaints. I had a homemade veggie burger and fries with Gruyere cheese.   The boys both ordered burgers and devoured them, so I assume they were good.  My Mom had the Short rib tacos and she raved about them, the server said that was there specialty and her favorite.   She also tried their white sangria which was pretty tasty too.     For dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake served with pistachio gelato and whip cream.... Um, can I say... YUM!",

So, my overall thoughts on the food were that it was tasty, but really the only thing that blew me away was the guacamole.  It was fabulous!  It came with a very splendid roasted tomato salsa and crispy corn tortilla chips.  We also shared the soup of the day, which in my opinion wasn't too good.  It was a modified tortilla soup, but it was oddly sweet, which isn't what I was looking for at all.  For our entree, we shared the rotissere chicken, which was quite good.  I especially liked the side dishes (spatzle and garlic spinach).

Attended to quickly. Drinks brought within minutes after ordering. Appetizer brought within 5 minutes of ordering. As soon as we finished our appetizer the main meal was ready. From arrival time to finish time we were here for a total of 30 minutes and were very satisfied! Great atmosphere and amazing food. A MUST try!",

If you are ever in the Phoenix area on a nice day, stop by for brunch and request outdoor seating.  There are a bunch of birds in the trees that sing to you while you enjoy your excellent food.

The service is consistently top notch - free valet, efficient and friendly hostesses, always greeted by a server soon after being seated, and attentive throughout food service.   Some of my favorite menu items are... the brussels sprout salad (with chicken added, it makes a great meal), short rib tacos, chicken nachitos, rotisserie chicken  and green chile mac and cheese.   Non menu item - margaritas, on the rocks, with salt - one of the best I've found in Phoenix!  Their brunch is excellent as well - try their chilaquiles or the short rib hash.  Mmmm... oh and their mimosa specials on Saturday mornings are well worth it too.  A trip to Chelsea's is never a bad idea!",

They are not my favorite when you take a burger and just toss a chile on it.   You can't be bothered to take the giant pickles off the burger?  Sure I can take them off myself but I like to eat my food the way the chef intended.  If this is it, the chef missed the mark.   All the rave reviews I had to try the Kale salad.  Sure it's kale - woot woot - but it's a bland kale salad.    Fun place to hang but so are a lot of places.  Maybe I needed to eat a cookie.",

Located near the busy intersection of 40th St. and Camelback Road, this place was a happening location from the moment we walked in the door. Modern, yet chic. Wifey started with the deviled eggs and they were delicious, as she actually shared them with me. She enjoyed the \"endless mimosas\" and since I was the designated driver, I stayed with the Arnold Palmer made with Simple Syrup. Delish.  We both had the crab cakes benedict and enjoyed them thoroughly. Came with some fresh fruit that was doused with what we believe was a mint syrup. The meal ended with a complimentary chocolate torte for her birthday. Served with what we believed was a scoop of pistachio ice cream, we waddled out the door and plan to spend the rest of the afternoon daydreaming and snoring over this fine experience.",

Because I love getting up early, grabbing the paper and having a leisure Sunday morning, reading about all the sales and news.    The servers were great. They brought a French Press pot of coffee to the table and even came back to pour the first cup.  Really good, and only for $2.50.  I was sold!  I ordered the eggs benedict with bacon instead Canadian bacon.  Plus a side of tomatoes and avocado.  The plate came out pretty quickly.  The yoke was a bit over done, and the sauce , not enough of it.  But it was tasty!  The English muffin was delicious!  The eggs came with a bowl of fruit.   The environment was great, they had the fire going and really easy going music playing, making it a great Sunday morning.    I will have to bring some other yelpers to join me on a Sunday, would love to try the white sangria, without being called a lush!",

Their beef is tender and flavorful. Their mashed potatoes are blissfully light and creamy. Their house French fries are uniformly crispy and pack a hint of spicy kick. Their taco platters let you assemble your own tacos on soft warm white corn tortillas. Even their caesar salad is particularly good.   As for drinks, I highly recommend the basil gimlet, Goodnight Emily, and their iced tea. One of these days I need to try their lemonade.   The service is friendly and attentive. Both indoor and outdoor seating are pleasant, though the natural canopy of tree branches on the patio can sometimes result in full sun. I bring a hat just in case.   Chelsea's Kitchen is absolutely on my favorites list.",

It started off with the complimentary sea-salt chocolate chip cookie, and continued with the fresh french press coffee and Chelsea's eggs benedict.  They pressed the coffee right on the table, and the aroma of grounds made the visit that much more memorable.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria to share, and would highly recommend it. Hey, it's 5oclock somewhere.   To top it off, our server took the extra time to split our checks individually.  Our waters were always full and she came out of nowhere with ninja-like speed to refill our sangrias as well.

They come deconstructed with house made to order corn tortillas, guacamole, pico, and an amazing kale and grape salad. The short ribs were tender, tortillas amazing.

The best part of living in Phoenix is right now, in February, we can sit outside on the patio and enjoy a drink while the rest of the country weeps into their Uggs and Northface's.   We got there around 2, a bit too early for happy hour (3-6 FYI), but ended up going with a pitcher of their white sangria. Now, usually I am a red sangria type of gal but this stuff was tasty! My girlfriend and I polished it off nicely. We also split the Nachitos. Oh god, these were soo good and perfect to soak up the sangria before having to drive home. Full of cheese, chicken, guacamole, and pico de gallo, these nachos were massive. I felt like we kept eating and the plate never ended. Eventually, we begged our waitress to take it away.

    "text": "I complained about coming to this restaurant before I even stepped foot in it.  Mostly because it's called: \"Chelsea's Kitchen\".  Much like the title of a generic romantic comedy, this place was designed for women. They dim the lights, put on the KY Jelly Pandora, throw some candles out and then hand you a menu of WTF? You serve tacos, burgers and salads.  YOU FUCKIN SERVE TACOS, BURGERS, AND SALADS (and a few random meat, potatoes, veggie dishes?)    The place is nice. It's a nice fucking place. Nice, the place fucking is. Unfortunately, I didn't bring virgo Mary and the Baby J, and we aren't planning on spending the night. I'm not looking for real estate, and having a nice place doesn't automatically justify ripping off your customers. I came here for fucking eats player, and this place isn't nice enough to justify this shit:  1 - Why did I just pay you $2.25 for a can of soda. Go fuck yourself, I'm thirstier than 12 god damn ounces.  2 - Why did I just pay you $15 for a salad, and then receive a bullshit sized salad? Here's what's on the Caesar: Lettuce, Cheese, croutons and 14 the dressing normally required to satisfy a grown ass man. Pull your shit together. STACK THIS FUCKER. If I'm giving you $15 and not receiving a protein, something isn't right. Do you know who has a 9.95 Caesar Salad? Fucking Mastro's. Some people actually order this as their main course? This place is for anorexics. This is the god damn dinner menu people. DINNER.  3 - Alright fine, the burger & fries were good, and in the same range of taste and price with other places in the area. But, the fact that I was basically cornered into ordering it is a real dick in the mouth. If I was looking for burgers, I sure as shit wouldn't come here.  Furthermore, I'm not giving you $20+ for 3 tacos and a side of beans or whatever the fuck you have. You have to be out of your mind.  Everything on the \"Very Special\" menu is not appetizing in the slightest.  I guess if you're not looking for flavor and want a Plain Jane meat and potatoes dish. THIS IS YOUR PLACE.  Lessons from Chelsea's Kitchen:  - First impressions count, and they can glaze over the eyes of someone who's already skeptical of your shit.  The second I saw a can of soda land on my table. I immediately hit eject. YOU HAVE A NICE PLACE, it's not that fucking nice though.  If you're going to fuck me on this, what else are you going to fuck me on? Wallet CLOSED for the remainder of my time here.  Any thought of ordering one of your overpriced appetizers just got flushed down the toilet. At least put some fucking bread on the table and look presentable. And, I'm the same guy who will give Macayos $100 for 2, simply because I got free chips out of the deal. Do you know how hard it is to spend $100 at Macayos? I've done it.  - WHAT the fuck is your theme? Pick an identity.  If I wanted a gourmet burger I'd go to Zinburger, Grind or Delux.  If I wanted upscale tacos I'd go to 20 other places before coming here, most likely Gallo Blanco. Now I'm left with $30 entrees, and it's safe to say I'm not coming to Chelsea's Kitchen for a $30+ entree, given the plethora of places that have their shit together in that price range.  Don't get me restarted on salads.  - I almost burned your building to the ground when I saw that you had valet, then I realized you didn't FORCE it upon me like some asshole I'm not going to mention. Kudos to you, I'll give you 2 stars instead of 1 for that reason. That, and the service was good, and everyone was friendly. Also, go back in time and give your mother an abortion: You have the biggest parking lot of any restaurant in the area, and you still have valet. I'm glad you're concerned with pleasing the \"I CAN'T WALK 10 YARDS\" crowd, as well as those who won't eat gluten and must have all things organic. See: Venn Diagrams for details.  - Your restaurant is the same quality as North or Central Bistro, but you're charging 50% more, and have 50% less items to choose from. Take the dildo out of your lungs.  - People on yelp mention your \"happy hour\"? No sign of it advertised anywhere, including your website.  Holler at me.  Actually don't.",

    "text": "It's been so long since I've written a review but I've been on vacation mode even after my vacation has been over awhile ago so BOOM! I had to review this place because I highly recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to anyone planning to visit Arizona.   PARKING: The lot is a decent sized but I can already imagine the craziness when it's busy. They also have complimentary valet parking! Super fancy *sparkle sparkle*   RESTAURANT: The inside is very classy, dark wood with table lamps adorned around the restaurant. I felt as if I was in a golf club dining room. I felt a little under dressed since everyone was wearing semi-formal attire while I was wearing a summer romper haha but after awhile I didn't pay no mind to whatever I or the other diners were wearing. Seating is plentiful: booths, 4 seating, bar, patio and outdoor seating.   FOOD: I personally thought that the menu didn't have a lot of variety. Each item was $10+: salads, burgers, sandwiches, egg Benedict's, steaks and such. Their menu definitely reflects as a brunch setting. My friends ordered their deviled eggs as an appetizer which tasted amazing and I'm not even a  fan of deviled eggs but these babies were tasty. I ordered a typical eggs Benedict, which was actually the first time I ever tried it and it was really good. Only downside was the muffin itself at the bottom was too spongy and it was difficult, and messy, to eat. But the eggs were poached to perfection and the hollandaise sauce was thick in consistently and not swishing all around the plate. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries and damn those fries were yummy! Burger was absolutely juicy and flavorful, wish I ordered that instead of the Benedict because it wasn't too filling. :(   SERVICE: Our server was Emily and if I can give a BEST SERVER AWARD, she would definitely win that award and I'm not even joking about this. Never have I ever had a server as attentive and personable as Emily. I wish every server was like her, she definitely made my experience at Chelsea's Kitchen 100000% excellent.  She made sure that we had water, she struck up sincere conversations and checked up on us frequently.   SUMMARY: - prices of food are 10+ - dress semi-formal or at least don't come here looking bummy. - definitely give their daily specials a try.  - bottomless mimosas (10AM-3PM?) $12 - I recommend any of their burgers with the fries, super yummy!  - make sure you get Emily as your server!",

    "text": "Chelsea's Kitchen had a 4th of July special: Buy 1 entree, get a 2nd one for $4! We were anticipating a lot of people there for an Independence Day dining deal (And they do not accept reservations), so we came here for an early dinner. We got there around 4:45 and were able to get a parking space with no problem. When we left at around 6 though it was quite crowded and there was a line for parking.  We were greeted and seated promptly. After poring through the menu, we decided on the deviled eggs appetizer, and I chose the short rib tacos. I also had some of the green chile cheeseburger.  The deviled eggs were beautifully presented, and were delicious. The filling had a nice creamy, tangy zest to it, and the eggs had a sprinkling of bacon pieces on them.  The short rib tacos were quite tasty. The short rib had a lovely, slow-braised texture and rich flavor. The plate came with a huge portion of fresh guacamole, pico de gallo, kale and quinoa salad, and hand-made corn tortillas. The dish was $18, but at such as huge portion I could have easily shared it with someone else.   The green chile burger I tried was juicy and packed with flavor, but not cooked to our specifications. It was ordered as medium-rare, but when we received it, it was closer to medium-well. It was still tasty nonetheless, but disappointing that for a $13 burger, it wasn't cooked to our requested temperature! The fries that came with the burger were excellent- perfectly crispy, yet tender on the inside. They were also dusted with a lovely bbq spice mix to add a slightly sweet, smokey flavor.  Service was good and drinks were refilled promptly as needed.   When you leave, be sure to try one of their free salted chocolate chip cookies! When we went, the cookies were a little unevenly salted to one area, so certain areas I bit into tasted super salty.",

    "text": "How have I not yet written a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix?!?  Ok, I think it's because I've had one bad experience here out of about 10 but overall I love Chelsea.  I love the atmosphere of this place and how you can have a romantic dinner inside, sit at the bar area for something more casual, or sit outside and enjoy the weather with some nice lighting in the trees.  The bar is half on the inside and half on the outside so you really do have several seating options.  The service staff is consistently phenomenal (with the one exception but the manager actually did a nice job handling that situation).  One time we were outside and it started sprinkling.  As soon as I asked to switch tables, they quickly accommodated us even though there was a wait and we were still on appetizers.  Now that is service!  The food- I LOVE the menu.  I always want to order everything off the menu and everything I've had has been exceptional.  The deviled eggs are my guilty pleasure along with the tartare.  I usually end up going with the short ribs for dinner but the fish is great as well.  The short ribs have always been melt in your mouth tender and I've never heard a complaint about anything amongst all the company I've brought here.  Plus, it helps that I moved out of. Phoenix, came back to visit, and saw a \"goodnight Emily\" drink special on the menu.  Who doesn't love to see a special named after them??  The drink was pretty darn good too, not that I'm biased or anything.  Don't believe me?  Try it for yourself!",

It was perfectly balanced.   For an appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs. Holy cow. I feel bad saying this because my grandmother, may she rest in peace, made the best deviled eggs....  until I had these.   For my entree I got the crab cakes. They were so fresh with a great lemon-cream sauce drizzled on top. They weren't laden with mayo or hidden in breadcrumbs. They were mounds of delicious crab meat. The sauce complemented every aspect of the meal. The server was so nice, made great recommendations, and entertained us as well.   Overall, we will be making this a staple date night restaurant.",

The staff, from the host, waitress, cook, and manager, really do not care if you are happy with your service or food.  We ordered butternut squash soup with a salad and hamburger with fries and asked for catsup.  The soup was so spicey I could not eat it and we never got any catsup.  The waitress never checked back until we were through - didn't even see her except to drop the check off at the table next to us and bring catsup to the table on the other side.  The manager comped the soup, but nothing was done about the fries without catsup.  We eat out a lot (at least 3-4 times a week in everything from sub shops to high end steak houses and I can truly say that this was one of the worst eating experiences I have ever had.  From now on, if we want food at Sky Harbor, we will go to one of the national burger places, such as Burger King - at least I know what I am getting there and they do serve catsup with their fries.  When the waitress was told about our food, she said \"well, it was so busy\" - she had 3 tables with 2 people at a table and all she did was take orders and bring the check.  How busy is that?  Servers brought all of the food.  This place is a real disappointment.",

Used to love their brussel sprout salad but the last two that I've gotten were not up to par and hit my stomach like lead; one had practically  poorly chopped brussel sprouts in it and the other had way too much oil on it. But everything else seems to be fairly consistent.  Would like to give that salad one more chance. I miss it.",

    "text": "I was visiting from Miami, when a friend recommended this cute spot. From the moment I walked in, the vibe was very cool. Laid back, but comfortable with dark rich wood hues, bug comfy booths and overall a very clean, fresh look. I originally wanted to go for brunch, but we ended up catching a late dinner and we weren't disappointed! First and foremost, I have to give a shout out to the brussel sprout salad! I happen to love these little green veggies and have never seen them served as a salad before, so Kudos to CK. We also ordered the chicken nachos, which were ok, but because nachos are always a big pile, the cheese melted very quickly and after a few minutes weren't too edible. We then got the chef's favorite taco platter, I believe it was short rib, which was nice and flavorful, my only drawback was that the tortillas are corn, not flour which I know are more authentic, but I still prefer flour! All in all, a great experience and I will definitely recommend to anyone heading that way.",

    "text": "Had an unenjoyable dinner at Chelsea's tonight. My daughter wanted her salmon cooked so that it was not raw and what they delivered was a very dry, tasteless piece of salmon with no lemon or sauce to try and cover up how bad the salmon tasted. We love good salmon. This was not edible. When we politely said so, the server asked if we had ordered it well... an implication that maybe we were the cause of this nasty entree. The four, small fingerling potatoes had way too much olive oil and my daughter was sitting there in a starving and sad frame of mind. She tried to eat the grilled broccoli and the red pepper flakes were too abundant so she'd grab water to get it down. I honestly think they'd run out of the grilled broccoli because I saw no evidence of such. My plate did not have the saffron yogurt sauce on the broccoli as promised. Where is the quality control? You'd think the server would notice that one plate has it on the broccoli and one doesn't. No such luck. They did bring her a different meal after we complained. I had the pork; it was fine but no real wow factor. Our server never filled my empty water glass; had to look for her and ask for some. She had no real concern in how dissatisfied we were with the meal or whether we were satisfied when my daughter received a different entree. Final surprise- when my daughter's entree came, there was a ton of sliced broccoli stalk that had definitely been grilled. So, I guess I was wrong on that broccoli. $50.00 later I wish I had cooked at home.",

    "text": "It is pricey, I admit.  But I really like the ambiance and the white sangria.  When eating at Chelsea's Kitchen, it feels like you are eating in a vineyard or spa... or somewhere more remote than Phoenix.  It is tucked in a quiet street surrounded by tree's and grass.  I've been here twice; once sitting inside, once outside.  Both options are great because you can eat without staring out at a parking lot.  Beware when sitting outside that leaves can potentially fall in your food.  But that is the price of sitting outside and I cannot mind that much.  The food was enjoyable on both visits, although again, a little expensive.  Swordfish tacos were grilled perfectly and the homemade tortillas were delicious.  The Del Mar salad was refreshing.  Tasty shrimp and crab although I wish they used something other than iceberg lettuce.  I'm going to keep on going back because the whole restaurant experience is very pleasant.  If they lower the food pricing a little, or give a little more wow factor to warrant the price, then this place will be complete.  3.5 stars",

    "text": "I've been a regular at Chelsea's for years and I have witnessed their ups and downs with service and food. It seems that you can never have a great experience here with either of those areas. Either the service is shockingly poor or the food dissapoints. They have some great tasting food on their menu but if you come back often for that item you will be dissapointed. One particular item that was a favorite was their cheeseburger. My friend and I nicknamed it the \"O\" burger primarily because we always said \"OMG\" after one bite. Well they have completely ruined that burger because they changed everything about it. Whoever is back in the kitchen making these changes needs to realize when NOT to mess with a good thing. Fix your other menu items that are lacking. But if you are looking for a cool restaurant with nice patio and vibrant social scene, I'd still recommend going to Chelsea's. Just don't be surprised if your burger falls apart and you get a side of major attitude from the servers.",

We could go somewhere else and eat for half that price, but after eating here, I have a difficult time going to other restaurants with lower quality food. Now I prefer to go out half as much, and eat at Chelsea's. I agree with the previous review that if you are a vegetarian, this is probably not the best place for you. I basically order the same thing every time, a hamburger, and the Arnold Palmer. Both are very good. As I said, after eating these high end burgers, I cannot eat fast food or even regular restaurant burgers any more. They taste gross to me. If you like eating cheaper burgers, don't eat here because it will ruin the experience. The environment and ambiance have a good balance between laid back and nice. You don't have to wear a suit (although you could), but you don't want to go looking like a slob either. As other reviewers have said, they have a great patio right on the canal with lots of shade.",

    "text": "First let me say that I rarely encounter a French fry that I do not like.  At Chelsea's Kitchen, the way-too-heavy sprinkling of spices actually helped me to eat much fewer fries than I normally would have consumed relying on self-restraint alone.  Sometimes this would be kind of a plus, but I was planning on indulging and was disappointed that Chelsea's managed to ruin my favorite guilty pleasure.  The rest of the food I tasted was good.  The Crispy Chicken Salad made with grilled chicken was perfect.  Fresh spinach, sugared pecans, and a delicious dressing - yum!  The veggie burger was excellent too.  It had grains, beans, veggies, and a nice sauce.    The service was a bit irksome.  The waitress disappeared for a while after bringing our drinks.  Once we finally got to order our food, there was another long wait, during which the manager came over, acknowledged that our food was taking a while, and asked if we were \"okay.\"  We responded with a half-hearted, \"yeah we're great...just waiting for our food.....\"  Wouldn't this type of visit from a manager normally include an offer of a free something or other?  But no - he said the food should be out shortly and left the table.  Afterwards we looked at each other like 'What WAS that?'    When the food came out (not right away), we needed a couple of things (another plate, ketchup - perfectly reasonable items) and the waitress took her time bringing them.  The atmosphere both inside and on the patio was warm and cozy with several fireplaces and a smokey-barbequey-campfirey smell wafting throughout.  Most of the food was good.  The fresh baked cookies waiting by the door are a nice touch.  Just don't expect great service.",

I would have been okay with the way things were, however now I am extremely pleased and will absolutely recommend Chelsea's Kitchen to all of my guests. The chef himself came to apologize for the delay, the server apologized again and stated he wanted our food to be just right, and also took care of the cost of our entrees, and the bartender was great in ensuring the follow through on this and that we were satisfied. My only regret is that I didn't now get everyone's name, only our bartender/waitress I believe it was Joshenay (sorry for the butchering of the name). Everyone was so friendly and accommodating, they are the reason I will be back. And not for free food because I would pay full price for that delicious filet any day.

Topped with caramelized onions, Gruyere, and a dijon sauce, it's a simple and perfect burger. The fries were really crispy and seasoned with garlic salt. Not really my thing, but I've never really been a big french fry guy. Everyone else liked them.  My girlfriend and another person in our party had the taco platters. My girlfriend had the Ahi Tuna. I tried a small piece of the fish, which was wonderful. As much as I liked my burger, I want to go back just to try any of the other items on the menu, because this was so good. It's also one of the few times I've seen her nearly clear her entire plate. The other guy had the pork taco platter, and really liked it.  We also split a pitcher of the Famous White Wine Sangria. A very sweet and satisfying drink.   The atmosphere is cool.  It has both a cozy and upbeat feeling. The music was a little louder than I would like, but that seems to be the \"in thing\" at restaurants nowadays. I hear the patio is the place to be, especially around sunset, but I guess that's an experience I'll need to save for another time. A note on parking, the only way to park is valet. It's complimentary, so there's no reason to complain (unless you're too cheap to tip the guy a buck or two). I just always find it funny when I watch a valet run to my car, when it's just a couple of feet away. It would quicker and more efficient to just give me my keys.   Chelsea's Kitchen is definitely the place to be. It was still pretty busy at 8:00 on a Saturday night, and the restaurant kept filling up after we were seated. Plus there were five people in our party, and four of us ended up having someone we knew come over to our table, or we went over to someone else's table to say 'hi.'   And on a humorous note...  While waiting, a couple people in our party who arrived early ordered an appetizer. The bar was packed, so they got it while waiting outside, instead. A manager had taken care of the order, but the charge was never added to our bill. Taking an honest approach, one of the people in our party tracked down that manger to inform him of the mistake. He comped it anyway, and jokingly asked that if anyone Yelps, to just give them a good review.  [I already planned to, but] little did he know...",

Either way, my fiancee had just graduated Pharmacy school and was owed a dinner from her wonderful father in law to-be and she chose Chelsea's Kitchen. When we were seated, a server immediately came and took our drink order, which was nice... After that another person came by with the drinks, and then finally our server. Our server was a late 20' something that looked less than thrilled to see our water drinking selves.   Anyways, ordered the Guacamole: $10   not that it was bad or anything, but when we ran out of chips it took five minutes for the server to get to our table and an additional five mins to get the chips. Not super busy either...   After this it was more of the same. I got the short ribs, which were supposed to be a specialty item. Now they were not bad, but I have had much and made much better. And they seemed a little dry.   My dad and brother got tacos that were good, but they ran out of tortillas and it took 10 minutes to get new ones.  The lady got fried chicken and it was a little dry,with grilled broccoli which was not received well by the Pharmacist. Anyways, my point is this....The server didn't see us as a phat tip and it showed via her lack of service. Over all food was ok, but the server ruined it.",

It's a fantastic lunch spot, if you are able, sit on the patio. Even if it is chilly out, they will sometimes have a fire going in their adorable fireplace. If not, they have space heaters.  If you are going for dinner, anywhere you sit is a good time. It is not a quiet place inside, but that isn't the vibe of Chelsea's.   The bar is fun to sit at - an indoor/outdoor set up, the staff is friendly and the drink selection varies enough that you can get an incredible vintage bottle, or a $26 bottle to suit your budget.  The food is incredible! I have enjoyed everything from their taco plates to pan-fried chicken to seafood. It is all delicious, and the servings are generous.  For dessert the hubs and I always get the ice-cream sundae, where you can add your own toppings at the table. May sound silly, but it's something fun we do... and it's a bit of a tradition now.  If you haven't had the pleasure of going to Chelsea's, drop by if you are able. You won't regret it.",

We were able to push all the tables out front together (well, okay, I'll give credit where it's due.. they did this for us) to accommodate our group. And that's where the good stuff ends.  I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day, because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day, but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food. I don't even remember exactly what I got, which nearly never happens. I just remember having sad face when I finished. Not because it was over.. .but because it was over so soon.. and with so little flair.  The real issue came with our check. No separate checks was an absolute nightmare and they wouldn't even help us figure out how much of the tax was ours etc etc... and I looked borderline annoyed when we weren't figuring it out fast enough. I had to use a calculator people. For real.  Maybe it was the crowd that did the trick, but they knew in advance we were coming. At least a week in advance. If they couldn't handle it, all they had to say was no.",

The place has a great atmosphere and a large patio in the back.  The back patio has a lot of trees, nice lighting, candles, and a fireplace.   This place is a little on the expensive side, but all of us enjoyed our food and it is worth it for the ambiance. I had the Howie Burger, which is a gourmet burger with gruyere (which is a cheese), caramelized onions, and Dijon sauce. It was delicious! The hostess and server were both friendly. The server even asked us if we wanted separate checks, which was refreshing and made things easy! I will definitely be back.",

I got it medium, as ordered,  and couldn't finish the huge portion. I had a Caesar's salad because I didn't know I'd get veggies with my meat.  The meal came with mashed potatoes and sauted kohlrabies with the green tops.  I didn't really like the kohlrabies since they were still so hard I couldn't safely stab a fork into them.    The children's menu was quite boring so my youngest had tacos from the regular menu.  The tortillas come separately so you put it together yourself.  They bring more tortillas if you want.  The hostesses seemed frazzled but the wait staff was still smiling and worked hard.  Free fresh baked salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door leaves a good last impression.",

For dinner I had the  Howie burger which was made perfectly and also shared the Brussels sprout salad with my wife.

Alas, I wanted a good dinner and we went there because everyone in the group heard such wonderful things about it.  Almost everyone at the table experienced some disappointments but no one could say that anything was \"bad\" - they only said they would not be back.  So, the food is not bad but it does disappoint in several categories.  The prime rib was cool and dry, not very creamy or tender.  My burned ends were not ends at all, they were cubes of the brisket that were later burned to look like the real thing.  That is cheating and very easy to detect because it is dry, hard, and over smoked.  To be fair, everyone had elements in their plate that made it very nice and kept the frowns at bay.  Something is missing in the kitchen, but it is a VERY nice place.",

People it's used in floral arrangements and is a plate garnish at best. Kale is the most gas producing, fart creating vegetable in the world.

We had 4 entrees and 2 salads plus some deviled eggs.  The eggs were good, which is a huge compliment from an non egg eating guy.  Loved, loved the Kale salad with grapes.  The combined bite hit all of the sweet bitter notes. The Brussel Sprouts with bacon and peanuts as a great version of what could be a normal salad.  I had the short ribs, and loved them and the accompanying mashed taters and roasted root veggies. The prime rib was perfect, with a nice horseradish side great potatoes and a really good spaghetti squash.  The only problem for this and the rotisserie chicken (which was amazing) was that there were two fairly large servings of a beigish veggie.  The salmon was good but not amazing.  Overall I would come back in a second.  A few minor tweaks would be great but a solid place for a very good meal.",

The menu is tied together with seafood and some Mexican dishes. In the spotlight are the tacos.  Two words:  shortrib tacos. HUGE portion of perfectly seasoned meat, guac, pico de gallo, rice and beans, with house-made tortillas on the side. You must try them!  Prior to this, my date and I were enjoying the shrimp ceviche when we see a picturesque plate of nachos presented to another table. Food envy. Yes, we are definitely coming back to sit on the patio and enjoy a gigantic plate!  I have never encountered such genuine, knowledgeable and charismatic waitstaff.

    "text": "My close friend had been wanting to try this place for a while now, so we came here tonight for a double date. I ordered the basil gemlit but I wanted to add blackberries to it and the bar was happy to oblige my request. The drink was really good. I love having fresh basil in my drinks because I feel like it really makes the drink extra refreshing and takes it to the next level. My boyfriend had one consistent complaint with his beers and it was that they were poured about only about 3/4 a glass with a really large head. He wasn't too happy about that. To start, the four of us shared the tuna tartar, which was a tuna tartar with guacamole on top served with fresh tortilla chips. The fish was cut to a good size and was super fresh. The guacamole was creamy and was perfectly simple that went well with the tuna. The chips seemed to be homemade. They were the perfect thickness and were salted the right amount. I highly recommmed this appetizer. For dinner, my boyfriend and I split the Ahi tuna burger and the short rib tacos. The Ahi burger was extremely, EXTREMELY salty. I was so hungry so I ate it but my boyfriend refused to eat his part. I was under the impression for some reason that this burger was going to be a seared ahi steak but it was definitely a gross ground patty. It came with a spicy mayo saucy, fresh avocado, lettuce, and a choice of side. We went with the french fries. The Ahi burger besides being really salty also seemed to all be one texture. Avoid the Ahi burger at all costs. The french fries were bomb! They were crispy with a soft center and they had a slightly sweet and slightly salty seasoning on top. It was a very nice mixture. The short rib tacos were amazing! I wish we ordered two orders of this instead. These tacos are self assemble. They come with pico de gallo, guacamole, shredded lettuce, a dressed chopped kale salad, a tangy tart salsa, and of course the short ribs and the mini homemade tortillas. I put everything on my mini tortilla and it was sooooo good!!! They initail give you 3 mini tortillas but you can and probably will request more. I definitely recommend trying the tacos here. If you don't get the short rib tacos, definitely try one of the other tacos. The atmosphere outside was really nice. The trees had cute little lights up in them that made the patio area super cute and quaint. Service came with a smile.",

Not only was everything tasty, but it also had a beautiful presentation. My favorite was the Brussels sprouts salad!! YUM! I think this was the best salad I've had, ever! If you don't like brussels sprouts, this salad just might change your opinion about it! hahaha The rotisserie jidori chicken was very tender, juicy and flavorful! Delish :) The surf and turf taco platter was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. They also have a great selection of signature cocktails. Cucumber press was really good and very refreshing. Also, you can never go wrong with the white sangria!   I will come here again if I ever visit Phoenix again. Great experience, highly recommended :)",

The beef and all other proteins are just USDA. FAR from grass fed or anything even remotely close to REAL high quality. The USDA label is a freaking scam. Look up what that actually means - it's not much! Completely misleading.   Because of that, I am knocking down one star.   I had the sea bass. It was pretty good, but not what I came here for. Please disregard ALL the grass fed reviews for this restaurant - it's no longer applicable to their menu and purchasing practices. Such a shame!",

First of all, I love the atmosphere and overall feel of this place as you walk in. It's designed to look like a one-story ranch house, with a peaked roof, a huge porch, and a large patio area out back with a brick fireplace. Chelsea's Kitchen is part of LGO hospitality (a group of restaurants that puts a modern twist on American comfort food operated by founder Bob Lynn) and is located in the beautiful Arcadia district. They specialize in big, flavorful portions and create their dishes fresh daily. There are several locations throughout California and Arizona (I'm a frequent visitor to La Grande Orange). We started our night out with some of their fancy cocktails. I've been on whiskey kick and got their Old Fashioned (the drunken cherries were a nice add) and my date got the Diego Rivera. I heard so much about their awards winning Short Rib Tacos and couldn't pass them up. The braised meat was delicious and tender and there was plenty to eat. My date is from Mexico City and she had their Seafood & Jidori Chicken Paella. It was a nice blend of chicken, shrimp and clams and she loved very bite. The service was excellent and the experience was definitely was worth the wait. They have complimentary valet parking and reduced prices on their happy menu. They also have $12 endless mimosas on Saturday afternoons.",

Even without the sour cream, they were still good. I also had the shredded kale and quinoa salad without Parmesan and I added avocado. The best think about this restaurant is they don't charge for avocado. How cool is that?! The salad was delicious and fresh.   For desert they offer a vegan strawberry gelato which is more like a sorbet. It was a little on the sweet side but hit the spot.   I live the atmosphere of this place, very warm and welcoming and with some really neat decor. The patio area is nice and cozy with misters and plenty of seating space. Parking can be a bit tricky as half the lot is blocked off for valet. I parked down the street and walked. Such is typical for some Phoenix area restaurants.",

It came with a strange mixture of corn and zucchini on the side, which wasn't a good combo -- but the sauce was good. Still, I wound up ordering french fries, which were also excellent. I had the LGO Tempranillo for happy hour and wasn't impressed. The service was decent, the view from the bar was gorgeous and the steak was good, but they don't have a lot of happy hour options. I won't be a regular there, but I'd go back for the steak and French fries.",

I don't know if she assumed we were a lesbian couple but didn't even offer to split the bill until we handed her two separate cards. The atmosphere itself was upiddy and unwelcoming. I don't believe I'll come back.",

It's hard to tell from the picture but it was more food then I could ever eat in a sitting. Came with their homemade guacamole and a great kale slaw. My wife couldn't decide between two salads so she just got a small of both. Third picture was the Shredded Kale and Quinoa Salad with a huge side of chicken. And the fourth picture was the Brussels Sprout Salad topped with bacon.",

The food here is hearty and flavorful, even the cornbread is so much more than what you'd think it would be.   Every time I come to Chelsea's I get the Kale Salad in some format- either as a meal or as a side. It's so fresh, tasty, light, and filling.   The short rib tacos are also a favorite of mine. The tiny tortillas are always perfect and it's the perfect amount of food for the price attached to it.   Yesterday was the first time we tried the bean burger, which completely fell apart after the first bite. Unfortunately then it was eaten with a fork, but the flavor was good and the cashew cheese spread is a nice touch.   Service here has never been bad. There is typically a wait, but you forget about that once you get to sit, relax, and eat such flavorful food in a comfortable atmosphere.",

Started with the Tuna Tartare - this was the perfect light appetizer I was in the mood for. The tuna wasn't overly dressed with soy ginger, and the guac...something about it was SO amazing! I think this was probably my favorite food we ordered. The lightness was also perfect with the white sangria - refreshing combo for the hot hot desert we live in.  Shared the Short Rib Tacos & the Brussel Sprout Salad with Jidori Chicken as entrees. I think the short ribs were really good - if short rib is something that tickles your fancy, this is something you should give a try! The brussel sprout salad was just okay for me. No complaints, but I probably wouldn't get it again.  Now ambiance - if you're going for dinner, check out the back!!!! I didn't sit out with all the hanging lights and I so regret it! Inside was so beautiful, but on my way to the bathroom, I got distracted by the set up. If I go back, I definitely want to sit out there and try so many more drinks and appetizers! Solid restaurant!",

I've only been here a couple of times for the brunch + $12 bottomless mimosas, and have had a fantastic experience each time. The food is delicious (my go-to is the chilaquiles), the customer service has been on point, and the vibe here is nice and relaxing. My friends ordered the lemon ricotta hotcakes and chelsea's burger. The hotcakes were amazing! My friend was craving french toast which they didn't have, so our server suggested these hotcakes and she was not disappointed. The burger was also great, but the shoe string fries that came with it was even better (we had to order extra fries as a side, if that's any indication how good it is).  There are lots of seating indoors and out in the patios. There's valet for parking. The only thing I'd change is to add more variety to the brunch menu. Other than that, I'd most definitely come back here for brunch again and try out their lunch and dinner menus.",

Was a little chilly but the waiter turned the propane heater on and all was good. He even changed the tank 5 min later when it ran out of gas... Lol. No problem.  I had a bowl of the tomato basil soup with cornbread croutons and olive oil to start. As tomato soup goes, one of the best I've had.   My wife got the ribeye steak dinner. On the plate was all the ingredients to make a taco with a side of mini tortillas. I tried hers and the meat was awesome. Full of smokey flavor from the wood fired grill.  I had a similar dinner with the exception of spare rib off the bone to place in the taco. We both loved everything on the plate. Including the kale & Quinoa salad. The salad just may have been my favorite item on the plate. Not sure it was all great.   For desert we shared three scoops of Gelato. Chocolate, mint & pistachio. Surprisingly the pistachio was My favorite. It came with pieces of dark chocolate as a garnish. Which I have come to enjoy as an adult... the chocolate was good and the mint was made with real mint leaf. I would recommend cutting back just a bit on the amount of mint used in that one. When using real mint it's a little different.   Oh and you can't end a meal w/o coffee. It was French press and hit the spot.",

Upon arrival we had the option of using valet parking  (which was interesting because the parking lot has plentiful spaces very close to the door). We opted to dine outside where the ambiance is mellow and relaxing.  The trees cast pleasant shade and felt like a break from reality. We felt unhurried and pampered. We ordered cocktails which were tasty and the bloody Mary had just enough vegetables and spice. We selected  the nachos that were MEGA large and MEGA delicious.  We all shared it and an order of shrimp ceviche.  It was so satisfying that the only other items were another round of drinks and a hamburger to share, with oodles of fries.  Unfortunately, a downside to sitting outside are the birds who hang out in the trees.  One made a poop deposit on my hair and on my sweater. You can't blame the restaurant for that!! On the way out, a tray of cookies was available to take a little dessert home for free. The cookies made me forget about the bird souvenir in my hair.   We will be back!!!",

It was not especially busy but service was nonexistent. Water never refilled, took forever to order, nobody asked how the meal was, etc. The worst part however was the food. I specifically asked that my Eggs Benedict be cooked firm and they came out essentially raw. As our waitress never bothered to check in, I had to flag her down and point this out. My comment was met with a blank stare and \"sorry about that\"! No offer to make me a fresh order. A few minutes later she came by and said she was \"having the kitchen make half the sandwich over\"..... I didn't realize Eggs Benedict was a sandwich. Anyway 20 minutes later a half order arrived by which time we were ready to leave. Fortunately there were free cookies on the way out so I got something to eat. Given the positive reviews perhaps this was an anomaly but for us a horrible experience (especially given the high price for what it was).",

    "text": "I guess I never made it to Chelsea's until yesterday because the location is slightly off the beaten path and tucked away on 40th St. Being such a big fan of LaGrande L'Orange (LGO), it was great to find some of the same food at Chelsea's. If you want a quieter, more intimate experience than LGO, this is a great choice.  The patio is completely tree-covered and the birds were chirping and squawking as loudly as they could around lunchtime. It was like a real-life version of the Tiki Room at Disneyland. Arcadia is probably one of the only places in the valley where you'd find a patio like Chelsea's with as many trees. Just beautiful!  We ordered Pumpkin Soup and Vegetables. Both were delicious...brussel sprouts and broccoli.  The brussel spouts were served slightly chilled and were blanched. They were a nice alternative to the usual grilled brussel sprout option which has been \"a thing\" since 2012.  I was very impressed with the broccoli preparation. In addition to the top of the broccoli, they cut uniform rectangles from the stalk and used that too with some shavings from the stalk. This gave the dish several different textures. When I cook at home I cook the broccoli stalks.* I genuinely appreciated the use of the whole vegetable in the dish at Chelsea's.   I remember watching an episode of Chopped once where all they got to cook with was the pieces of food and vegetables that are usually discarded (celery tops, the ends of the onion, etc.). I thought of my grandparents (Italian immigrants) and how they valued food and used every last little bit of it for soup or even for compost.   At any rate, I will most definitely go back to Chelsea's and try more menu items. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because I think the portions could be larger for the prices. However, since this is the more upscale version of LGO, I'm sure their overhead is bigger and they have chef instead of cooks. The service was very good.  I wouldn't exactly call this a \"family restaurant\" but having kids on the patio would be fine. I did notice stacks of booster seats off to the side of the patio, so they might actually have a lof of kids there from time to time. There was a small family sitting across from us. The children were about 4 and 6. The little boy was learning how to use a fork and jabbed his chicken in one whole piece. It was very charming to watch his little cave man attempt to be civilized.  *If you want to try cooking broccoli stalks at home, cut them and put them in a steamer or pressure cooker (InstaPot) to make them more tender. Then, if you grill them, they'll be much easier to eat. The same is True for Chard stalks, although they are more bitter than broccoli stalks. You can add some reduced balsamic vinegar to tone done the bitterness.",

The tacos were AMAZING esp bc they were served with homemade tortillas! Bae devoured his veggie burger like he always does. For dessert we ordered mint chocolate chip gelato which was super legit because they use REAL mint and high quality dark chocolate (which is unheard of elsewhere). After that, we ordered coffee, served freshly brewed in a French press. YES.  The patio seating was perfect. I loved the cozy backyard feel with strings of lights and TREES. The trees reminded me of home. The staff was great too! They were patient, charismatic, and even snapped a pic for us! Multiple pics actually - because I kept blinking lol.   I've been raving about this place ever since. I can't wait to go back!!! I wish we had one on the west side.",

    "text": "I first went to Chelsea's Kitchen with my dad.   As I've said many times, my dad lives for the latest and greatest in fine dining and this time he picked Chelsea's Kitchen.  CHELSEA'S KITCHEN  Chelsea's Kitchen is owned by parent company LGO Hospitality.  The name \"La Grande Orange\" (LGO) was inspired by the creators looking through historical books on Southern California.  A pictorial review of the vast citrus groves that provide the United States with much of it's fruit were always part of California. Inspired by that piece of Americana, they pay reverence to those good times, positive vibes, and winning spirit.  LGO Hospitality includes, The Misfit, LGO Grocery & Pizzeria, Chelsea's Kitchen, LGO Cafe, The Luggage Room, Ingo's Tasty Food, Ingo's Tasty Diner, LGO Bake Shop, Grateful Spoon Gelato, and Buck & Rider.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My dad and I were seated at a lovely table on the patio.   My only complaint about the patio is the amount of leaves that fall into the food and drinks, but hey, that's not really a problem, is it?  We ordered some drinks. I tried the Diego Rivera, which was Frida Kahlo Blanco Tequila, Grapefruit juice, and fresh Thyme. Nom Nom Super Yummy!  I had the paella and my dad had the daily catch.   OMG my paella was YUMMY and HUGE! My meal included an extremely generous portion of seafood and fresh sausages.  The staff has been WELL selected, which speaks to the professionalism of the management.  The staff was not OVERLY friendly, which I appreciated, and they had their timing down; always around when we needed something, yet not hovering either.  CONCLUSION  I had an incredible meal and pleasant stay at Chelsea's Kitchen.  I will definitely be back!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Parking is a bit hectic. We used the Valet.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchelseaskitchenaz.com&s=93c673873e3f0485e21cb42718fe966f2f438859a4eb126aa7a72691b9fc496f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chelseaskitchenaz.com</a>",

It's kid friendly and we love all the healthy choices for our family. The ambiance is great for visiting friends or family with it's beautiful patio especially when the weather is nice. It's also great for meeting up with girlfriends for a pitcher of yummy sangria. Our favorite is the Ceviche as a starter, the Kale Salad is to die for and it's a toss up between the Prime Rib, the Sirloin Tacos or the Green Chile Burger with their signature fries. We always finish with their amazing Red Velvet cake that's layered with delicious cream cheese worth every calorie and a French Pressed Coffee. After 8 years it's still our favorite we appreciate their consistency from service to food!!",

We lucked out and got a table out on the beautiful patio. They had heaters and a wood fire going to keep us warm on the cooler afternoon. Our server gave us a few recommendations of her favorites and I'm glad I took her advice and ordered the ahi tacos. The ahi was perfectly cooked rare and came with homemade corn tortillas, salsa, guacamole and a few sauces. The unassuming kale salad side was phenomenal. I'm not sure what was in it but I could have eaten another plate of it. My friend ordered the short rib tacos and the portion was enormous and the meat super tender. Lunch was super pricey but I wasn't paying so I'm not complaining.",

    "text": "Well, we wanted to sit on the back patio.  You see, being hearing impaired, a crowded dining room is just a horrendous cacophony of sound, none of it understandable.  I wish more restaurants got this.  Anyway, walked to Chelsea's as it's in my neighborhood.  At 7:30 on a Friday, they were booming, even feeding people on the front patio!  For me, that is just weird, dining in front of starving people waiting for a table.  Daughter went to the hostess, and requested a patio table.  The curt response was, \"First Available, one hour wait\".  Sheesh, not very inviting.  We wove our way to the back patio and tried to get near the bar, after about a ten-minute wait, I was next in line and my daughter calls me to turn around, a waiter had stopped to take their drink order.  That was super-nice, but I knew it meant another ten minutes easy, since he had to go back, put in the order, serve and clear tables and get our drinks back to us.  I would have preferred to simply order myself at the bar, but whatever, they had already started.  I have to say, the servers here do not reflect the attitude of the hostess and the guy that got our drinks picked up an easy big tip for that.  Eventually, we were called to our table, smack-dab in the middle of the cacophony.  Christina, our server, quickly appeared, made sure our drinks were updated, made some recommendations and left us to decide.  I was interested in the Chicken Nachito's, having stared hungrily at a woman eating them in the bar area for like, 20 minutes. (sorry panama-hat lady).  I was confused by the menu description, \"Chicken or Green Chile\".  Christina assured me that they could do both, and in fact, suggested that I try the short-rib meat too.  Damn, that girl was on her game.  I went with her suggestion, and it was killer.  First daughter had the Nachos, but with almond-cheese (gak!) - it's a vegetarian thing.  Second daughter had the veggie burger and wife had some sort of salad, and some of my Nachito's, which I was in the process of scarfing.  This was a portion so huge, that I took half of it home, and just finished it, with some of that green-chile cheese dip from Hopdoddy's poured over it.  Super tasty.  I highly recommend the Nachitos, bag the chicken and go for the short-rib meat.  Tasty, crunchy, cheesy, fresh guacamole, sliced fresh jalapenos, it is indeed a meal in itself.  Service made this visit exceptional, I didn't get the server's name on the back patio that served us drinks, but thanks for going the extra mile!  Christina was exceptional, friendly, accommodating, timely - everything a server should be - thank you Christina for making the night!",

    "text": "Sometimes I bookmark places because it has a dish I want, and sometimes I just bookmark a whole bunch and decide on the day of. And I went with Chelsea's Kitchen since it has good reviews. But somehow it didn't meet up to my expectation. Or it could be I had a wrong dish from Chelsea.   We arrived before noon and it was amazingly packed already. You know it's a fancy place when they do valet during that hour. That, or the place is just really packed that they run out of parking fast. Great valet service though. Very nice people.  Indoor was all taken so we chose the outdoor and didn't have to wait long. The outdoor patio is great for a nice sunny day like that day we went. My only complaint is the flowers from above frequently fall down a lot so it got into my water.   Short Rib Taco ($19): I usually ask the waiter's recommendation when I don't have a dish in mind to order. She told me their short rib tacos is a popular dish so that's what I chose. Being the Asian that I am, I was expecting the actual Korean short ribs hence it costs so much. But it turns out more like shredded beef or almost like pulled pork when I had in Hawaii. The dish came with tortilla chips of course, salsa and cole slaw.  Hmm not just I was disappointed but the dish itself was not that great either. The meat was sooo chewy and nothing special about the flavor worth mentioning.   Fries ($4): I'm so glad I had fries as my appetizer. Sadly, I think that's the best thing I ate at Chelsea's Kitchen.",

The food took forever and our server was no where to be seen. When we finally got our food..meh. The fries were cold and not the usual long fries..short and stubby like the bottom of the barrel. The short rib tacos (used to be the best in the valley) tons of fat and gristle. Ugh..not good! So disappointed, don't know what is going on but hope its just a rough patch for my favorite place in Arcadia.",

It was buzzing with activity , parking almost full ( must mention the free valet !!) , and people galore. We were immediately seated and had 5 more minutes of Happy hour. So took advantage of the $5 cocktail. I got the End Game , vodka with cucumber and chillies which was not great. But my Ahi tuna taco platter was worth every penny and minute spent at this place. Service was quick and the aioli and quinoa salad side with guac and fresh salsa were over the top great. I loved the homey feel and simple tasty food.",

There is a lot of sugar on the French Fries. I prefer savory over sweet, but today's society is so hungry for sugar - maybe I am out of the mainstream. The meat in the burgers is really good, but they struggled with the temp on this visit. They still serve the Howie Burger with sweetened pickled onions instead of caramelized onions as advertised on the menu. Its strange that they would not have remedied this in three years. Either change the menu or make it per the menu - either one. The service is great even when they are slammed.",

If you are an old fashion fan, they make great ones. And they are on the happy hour menu, also. The food is good, close to great. I will definitely go back again, soon. AND If its just as good as last time, I will for sure write another review giving them 5 stars. Good Job, keep up the great work!",

    "text": "To start off, this review should have been given months ago since we tend to go here a couple times a month. Chelsea's is our favorite place to ride our beach cruisers down the canal so we can partake in some cocktails and great American comfort food.   Favorite Dish: It has to be the Prime Rib French Dip. With very generous potions of beef and a homemade baguette you would think that would be enough. They take it a step farther with an amazing homemade horseradish sauce and perfect au jus. Wait there is also the Fish Tacos. The fish is so fresh and flaky and the brown's sauce with fresh vegetables make this a meal that has to be tops. I then remember the Chicken Nachitos, Pan Fried Chicken, Soups and so much more. There are so many favorite dishes it's very hard to choose one. You can't go wrong.  Service: Chelsea's has had a lot of the same servers for the last two years we have been going there. That tells me two things, one the establishment takes good care of there employees and they are happy. The other is that Chelsea's has done an amazing job in finding good, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Amazing how service can make a meal taste so much better.  Dessert: Yes have the Red Velvet Cake. You will gladly run the extra 5 miles tomorrow.   So after a great meal and some drinks we make our way home via the canal in hope that the ride will burn a few of the many calories we indulged in. We are so fortunate to be able to have a pit stop midway at the Biltmore Resort. Review coming soon!",

Had the market salad and I loved that the dressing was at the *bottom* of the lettuce and not drenched on top. Very fresh. French press coffee brewed at my table was a nice touch (for those wondering - coffee goes well with any meal in my book).  Kids menu was a little deceptive - it lists just the entree and side but it also comes with fresh cut fruit and portions are perfect.   Wait staff was soooooo nice. Ambiance was inviting. They definitely know how to maintain their stellar reputation :)",

It does get busy due to it's great location, food and service.  Ordered the Chicken Nachitos and a Salad.  The nacho dish is HUGE, you have been warned.

Sight--beautiful little building with manicured landscaping, tucked into a desert oasis so soothing to your eyes. The inside is well appointed with wooden tables nicely spaced without crowding. Touch--the weight of the tables,  the comfortable chairs and booths,  made for relaxing.  Hearing-- nice background music softly plays,  allowing the patrons pleasant speaking volume without having to raise voices to talk over the sounds. Smell--the aromas of the kitchen just ignite the palate which brings us to Taste--fresh ingredients,  combines into amazing selections, that reward the palate with every bite. I am smitten...  I have to address some of the negative comments,  as I just can not see a basis for them.  Portions were ample, infact,  we could not finish any of your plates. Prices were spot on for quality,  presentation,  portion.  And the staff-- could not be any friendlier,  attentive to our needs and so very, very pleasant.  We were never rushed, the timing of courses was perfect, refills exactly when needed.  It was an outstanding experience!!!",

Not like the one I had at Sky Harbor. It was packed when I arrived,a 20 min wait. No problem, nice place and lots to look at here. Parking lot was jammed ,but I was blessed enough to find a spot. My friend Valeted,which was also nice as it was free.  The fire place was going full steam, lovely since it was rainy and cold outdoors. Our server was Cara, and she was lovely. She kept our drinks filled and was very attentive even though, she was very busy with a full house. I ordered soup and the Brussel sprout salad, I have to say it is the best salad ever. They had run out of soup of the day,and were substituting french onion. I love French Onion, but this had no flavor. Cara got me something else right away. She was so awesome. My friend got the French Dip, she said it is now one of her favorites. At $15.00 she said, well worth it.  It was a lovely day and a lovely place. I am excited to go back.  I may try the airport one again, I hope it can compare. My last time there was less than fun. Any way, if you are looking for a lovely afternoon somewhere, this is the place.  The staff is warm and friendly.  They seem very genuine and the place is beautiful.  Bathrooms are nice and clean and very modern.",

Valet parking is there to help as the parking lot is small.  They have inside and outdoor seating, and even with the high temps the patio is cool with the misters. Service was excellent and friendly and the menu had a good amount of variety.  The kitchen is small but they have a real good handle on getting the food out.  I enjoyed the short rib tacos but the star for me was the kale salad.  Outstanding.  Hubby had the burger and said it was the best that he had ever had.

Huge plate of deviled eggs for the kiddo and we were set.  There are definitely more items on the menu I want to try because all the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good.

We skimmed through the list of other places and called for a reservation. we were told it wasn't necessary for a Saturday night, that it was about a 15 min wait, so off we went! We didn't even wait..we were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty full. It was LOVELY. Such a pretty restaurant. Nice, friendly service and a beautiful patio. We sat outdoors and it was great. A nice selection of music was playing and it was just a great vibe. Yes it was loud, but in a fun way. We ate off the AZ restaurant week menu-salad, short ribs and red velvet cake. All AMAZING!! The short ribs were super tender and the dessert was perfect. Pretty restrooms too :) Can't wait to go back!",

They plated it on two different plates for us without us even asking, we thought that was really nice.

We called the manager before hand(Brian) and he took excellent care of us (our waiter did too). Not only did he make sure we got a table quickly (at 730pm on a Friday night), but they got us in and out in time to get my Dad back to the airport in time to catch his next flight.   I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I really enjoy it all! My favorites would have to be the Ahi taco's and the Brussel Sprout Salad (which is also great with chicken on it!). Other great choices are the Howie Burger, Del Mar Salad, Short Rib taco's and the Short Rib meal, and the Halibut. The melon salad is great too (Especially with the ahi taco's!) The kids meals are amazing as well. My daughter loves the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. They both come with side fruit and fries (or i'm sure you could sub fries for another side)  Great food. Great Sevice. One of the best patio's in the area. LOVE IT!!",

It's always crowded but the outside seating surprisingly isn't as hot as you'd think being 110 degrees outside. The prices aren't the cheapest but as I am a hungry man who eats a lot i always go home with a doggie bag. Also please take 3 chocolate chip cookies when you leave because I do and I feel bad, but they are so good. I'll probably be back in two days for lunch",

    "text": "Now here's a little story I'd like to tell about a one Chelsea's Kitchen who we know so well. All I can say is that I wish this was my kitchen. The eatery on 40th and Camelback is yet another fun creation by the La Grande Orange family.   I can't believe it's taken me this long to review a top notch spot like Chelsea's. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I visit, if I closed my eyes I can almost pretend that there is a lake just past the comfy outdoor patio. Then I open my eyes and realize that's the canal...dam. But, let's focus on the awesome and not the inevitable here. I like Chelsea's. I do. I've been for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every time I visit, I'm happily satisfied and pleased.   Have you had the Chelsea's burger? No? Go right now. Go... order one. It's burgerlicious. It has the special sauce aka thousand island dressing. It has a crispy buttery bun and freshly cooked meat. And the french fries. OMG, the french fries. So french fries might be my weakness and I try to avoid ordering them at all costs, but at Chelsea's I lose all control of my willpower.   Have you tried the fish tacos? Expensive you say? Why yes, yes they are astronomically high in price. But once you save your pocket change and make the big plunge into your wallet, it'll be worth it. I assure you my friend, it will be worth it. Check out the swordfish tacos or if you're really in a Daddy Warbucks mood, try the Lobster ones. The fresh guacamole, the taco sauce, the fresh pico de gallo and the fish...yum.   And the last item to be highlighted during my sonnet aux Chelsea's will be the Chicken Nachitos. Yes, I know. Nachos? Boring! But, these are a pile of heaping, crunchy and massive chips, cheese, meat, salsa, avocado, beans and who knows what else. It's a great way to start your 5,000 calorie meal. You won't be sorry. Your diet might make you sorry, but during the very moment you consume them...you will not be sorry.   For the healthier options, my suggestions include the shrimp ceviche and the Del Mar Salad. I heart avocados as if you can't tell already...and both of these dishes have their fair share of the good green stuff itself.   The end.",

Don't miss the white sangria, it is refreshing and wonderful to share. The service is usually good although the last time we visited, the hostess seemed quite bothered to help us. The only real complaint I have is that they only take reservations for parties of 18 or more. 18?! Really? Excessive. Without a reservation on a Saturday night, you will easily wait for over an hour. The patio is fabulous and this is a great brunch/lunch/dinner spot in Phoenix.",

The drinks were phenomenal.  However, the only person's dish that blew us out of the water was mine (the short rib taco platter).  The other two dishes (the rotisserie pork taco platter the ahi tuna burger, and the del mar salad) were underwhelming .  My fiancee didn't even finish his burger.  The corn tortillas masked a lot of the flavoring and I wish they could provide alternatives.  I would return here with a group of friends but only to have some drinks and order very specific menu items.",

You are the only place?  Please bring them back!  We haven't been there since the last time when we found out they were taken off the menu.  I miss you Chelsea's Kitchen! FYI Arnold Palmers here are delish!  Deviled eggs are scrumptious too!  Get the big order... you'll eat them all!  Oh and one other thing that I have had is the Chicken.... Roasted or rotissere... its very tastey too.  Beautiful patio if you like to sit outside... very loud inside.  Free salted chocolate chip cookie on your way out... right by the door.  Its strange...

    "text": "What a great experience I had at Chelsea's Kitchen!  We had to wait 15 minutes, even with a reservation, which would have irked me a little bit if the Cardinals game hadn't been on TV in the bar area. The atmosphere is very nice, with real fireplaces both in the dining room and out on their beautiful patio.  It has the feel of a casual, slightly upscale gathering place for couples, friends, and families alike. Once we were seated, our server couldn't have been nicer or more attentive. We shared a small LGO caesar salad, identical to the one served at LGO (as the name implies) and thus delicious! For entrees, we shared the swordfish tacos and the short ribs with the over-easy egg on top. The swordfish tacos are, as promised, the best fish tacos I've had in the Valley, filled with big pieces of grilled swordfish, a little cabbage and tomatoes, guacamole, a slightly sweet sauce, and a great salsa on the side. The short rib dish is another one of their specialties.  The short ribs were tender and served with a yummy red wine jus, over mashed potatoes and veggies. I'm not sure what the egg on top adds to the dish (other than calories and cholesterol), and I personally would do without it next time, but you gotta give them credit for pairing such ingredients and having the dish still be great. I'm glad we tried Chelsea's Kitchen, and I'll be back many more times for their great food at reasonable prices, all with friendly service and in a cool atmosphere.",

Friday lunch and was led to a comfortable booth where we were greeted and drink order taken. To start we ordered the large deviled eggs with bacon on top. The eggs are large, six in total, all bursting with flavor, creamy, smokey, salty goodness. For my entree I opted for the Chelsea cheeseburger without bun, spicy mayo and kale slaw. The burger came out with a heaping order of fries, waitress noticed and told us to enjoy the fries and proceeded to bring out a heaping order of kale slaw. The burger was large, juicy and one can tell it was made to order with quality ground beef. The kale slaw was a wonderful marriage of kale and quinoa with sunflower seeds and some Parmesan cheese. The fries were a bonus and were very flavorful but perhaps lacked crunch. Service was fantastic and everyone is treated to chocolate chip cookies with sea salt as they leave the restaurant. Parking is never a problem as they offer complimentary valet parking. Brunch, lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong at Chelsea's Kitchen.",

We had a party of four and knew this so we arrived early but still ended up waiting about an hour which we expected but there wasn't many spots to gather and hang out to wait with a cocktail. But regardless I'd say totally worth the wait once you sit down, just be prepared on a Friday night.",

There's usually a wait on the weekends so make sure your not too hungry cause sometimes you'll be waiting awhile. I've been here many time and every single time I leave with a big smile on my face because it's just so great. I can never leave here before I have the sangria pitcher and nachos. Try them you won't regret it. My mouth is watering just thinking about the nachos and sangria. Ok that's it I'm off to Chelsea's kitchen this weekend!",

The open kitchen was also a huge plus!  Now on to the food which is really the main draw! I had the prime rib and it was one of the best I've had. Perfectly smoked, thick cut and the homemade au jus was fantastic! I tried my friends smoked chicken which was great as well- packed with flavor from the outside smoke rotisserie, it was juicy and cooked just right.  The drinks were also delicious! We ordered pitchers of sangria for the table and they were made to perfection (tip: go for the red over the white sangria).   Overall, Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the best restaurants I've dined at in Phoenix. Definitely recommend it! Oh, don't forget to take a fresh salted caramel cookie on your way out.",

They also own La Grande pizza, which is also really close to this restaurant that has great pizza and market there.  I really love the atmosphere here. The only negative that I find of this place is the parking, which I wish you could park yourself more often than not but I guess it's not a terrible thing with all the bad drivers in this city. They also don't take reservations and unless you get there right when they open for lunch unless you're really lucky you will be waiting for 10-15min. Anyway if you haven't tried this place, you should and you most likely won't regret it. They have awesome short rib tacos and guac and chips. Beer and wine selection is so-so and cocktails I still have to try but food and atmosphere are B+, this place is a home run in my book",

We started off with a pitcher of the white sangria, which I highly recommend. It had a nice hint of oranges, apples, and lemons, but the wine wasn't completely overpowered and still managed to shine!  We started off with the deviled eggs, which were delicious and an excellent way to start off the meal. The huevos rancheros are out of this world! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the green chiles gave a nice kick, and the guacamole provided a nice creamy texture to counteract the crunch and chew of the chiles and tortilla. We also got the hotcakes, which were moist and fluffy, with some fresh berries on top. They were a nice way to finish off the meal after the huevos rancheros. Our waitress was great, and provided wonderful service throughout the meal.   Great place to go for brunch, and I can't wait to go back and try it again for dinner. This is now my go-to restaurant to take people visiting from out of town!",

I got the white sangria which is so tasty, it has got to have cake flavored vodka in it or something.  It's heavenly!  We ordered the short rib tacos which were so much fun to eat.  The plate had shells, short ribs, guacamole, pico, and kale slaw.  The guacamole was some of the best I had on our trip.  The slaw went well with the tacos but I preferred it as a tiny salad.  We also got he chilaquiles which were great.  We wanted to go back!",

I finally settled for the supposedly popular Santa Fe style eggs. I paid $19 for a mysterious meat drenched in a bland, oily sauce, with a runny egg and guacamole on top. I paid $24 for a \"famous\" white sangria pitcher that tasted like boxed wine mixed with club soda. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I would give Chelsea's kitchen zero stars if possible.",

The truth is that part of the high rating is consistency of quality. Take for example the Ribeye Steak Taco: it's clearly superior to anything you'll have elsewhere but also consistently so. That's the hallmark of a 4 to 5 star restaurant. It's not that this dish will make you break out into an \"alleluia song\" at your table, but you'll be very pleased ... every time.",

Must have is the Brussels sprout salad (It's aaaaamazing! Don't ask questions, just order it!) they will even split it to share as a starter. Other faves are the tuna tartare and guacamole, tacos (fish and chicken are both great), and the kale and quinoa salad is awesome.   The patio is perfection from October-April. In the colder months they have a wonderful outdoor fireplace and plenty of heaters to keep you comfortable. The sangria by the pitcher is amaze as well!   Just go.",

We asked a server if the table's were available and she advised that on the weekend they were seated by the hostess and she was unsure how they were being handled on a Tuesday night? We confirmed with the hostess that these tables were first-come-first-served and took the seats under the very messy tree.  Nothing like small leaves in your hair and food.  No wonder they were available! After about 10 minutes sitting unattended we lassoed a waiter. He acted more than a little put out that we found him rather than the other way around. While the bar food, nachos, was edible it was served cold. The melted cheese had already congealed by the time it reached us. That was dinner, there was no further waiting for a table where actual dinner was served. Bottom line, for me, is the entitled Arcadia-scene is not for me. The food here, is edible.  The valet parking is unnecessary.  The wait, because of un-bussed tables (at least on the patio) was unnecessary. There are other more civilized places in this town to spend money. I won't be back.",

The pancakes may be good to some or weird to others. They remind me of lemon pound cake with a corn flour taste. The eggs Benedict was good, but not great. The food comes out pretty fast if you do Sunday brunch.",

I recently was in Arizona for college graduation and my parents took me to Chelsea's Kitchen to celebrate.  The atmosphere is great and the service was fantastic. Most importantly the food BLEW MY MIND! Everything I ate was delicious! I recommend the tacos, (I personally had the swordfish tacos) homemade guacamole and make sure to try the ceviche.   My dad had the burger and he raved about how great it was. I was also surprised at how delicious the French fries were.  I have always been a huge fan of Le Grande Orange, but I think Chelsea's Kitchen is 10 times better!   I can't wait to return to Arizona to enjoy this place again!",

The menu selection was reasonable and the food was overall good.  The preparation was first rate.  My only misgivings was the drink service.   I had been biking and needed a refill to my ice tea.  It took a while for it.  The red velvet cake was simple delicious.  The atmosphere was airy and comfortable.  The decor is simply, yet inviting.  The bathroom decor was minimalist and modern.  However, there was a mild sulfur smell (maybe sewage) eminating from the bathroom.  It was not the last thing I cared to remember before leaving.  I hope that this issue has been addressed.  Overall I would recommend it.",

    "text": "When I review, it's very dish based, and if a favored dish disappears off the menu, I feel restaurant betrayal... for a long time, that was the case for me and my love for Chelsea's Kitchen. But I have returned, up for trying something new, equipped with yelped suggestions and an awesome dining buddy, I made a reservation and headed over.  Being a transplanted Phoenician, I hate valet parking... even if complimentary, I just prefer self parking... LUCKILY, I got the last parking space:) I have to say, watching the Valet was like watching a well oiled machine... very quick and they always asked each group waiting for their cars how their dining experience was. Service done right!  That is something I can also say about the service once I walked INSIDE Chelsea's. They seated us right down on our reservation rights and our waitress for the night was attentive, but not too attentive, chatty, but not too chatty. Water glasses were always filled and questions always answered and half orders even offered up. LOVE the service there! And that's coming from a person who usually doesn't care for service--Food trumps service for me, but when service is outstanding, it's plain as day and greatly appreciated!  So the dish I LOVED when Chelsea's first opened with their Chicken dinner complete with mashed potatoes, I think corn was on the plate as well and a cinnamon roll... YES, cinnamon roll. I believe they still have the chicken, but the roll has rolled off the plate:( I know to most it may have looked strange, but it was like having a free dessert and I MISS it so! And I wonder if the chicken is the same... crispy skin with juicy meat inside and generous portions? I hope so, though I spied a few \"chicken was dry\" reports on yelp that make me veer away from ordering it again.  The menu has always been difficult for me because I'm not one to order tacos or burgers, for which Chelsea's is well known. And other things on the menu sound tasty but then there's the \"except for.\" Case in point: Attempting to share the Wedge Salad was difficult because of the Blue cheese involved... I'm particular about cheese, preferring milder flavors like Mozzarella. In asking my fellow foodies at work what they loved they screamed Seafood tacos... swordfish, scallops, Lobster. And I was ready to do it to take that Chelsea's taco plunge, but my buddy had a better idea: Sharing the Chefs Short Ribs and Mash... Crisp but not burnt on the outside and soft on the inside. It was like the perfect dinner roll, Beef-style! It came with 4 portions so perfect to split in two.  For an appetizer, I do love their Nachitos. It was warm and refreshing at the same time and definitely could make a meal all on it's own.  For dessert, can't say I remember anything being to die for... or rather, having ROOM for dessert outside of the Cinnamon Roll, BUT I can say great things about the Dessert Martinis... My partner in crime had to try the Espresso or Chocolate Martini... she couldn't decide and asked if she could blend the Godiva Chocolate Liquor with a hit of Espresso... Our waitress gladly asked the bartender and we got it + overage. We toasted to a good meal she, with her Martini Glass and I with the extra 'tini in the cap of the shaker. That drink is DANGEROUS. Tastes harmless but could get you pretty tipsy.  Lastly, ambiance... I love it... with it's fire places and warm wood and brick accents It makes me feel like I'm somewhere else in the US, somewhere colder where you want to stay inside and sit by the fire. Definitely a nice place to bring your folks when they visit or for a lovely date or dinner with a good friend.  Next up for me, is a brunch visit! I wonder if I can order off the kids menu... Lil monkey pancakes and PB&J sushi? I'm Kid menu jealous!  P.S. Kids eat FREE everyday 3pm to 6pm and Happy Hour 3pm to 6pm - 7 Days a Week... now that's a plus!",

While there are so many enticing menu options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water.   The rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes, except for my mom. She really didn't like the red pepper soup, although she's not one to complain. Our waiter noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it. She replied \"not really\" and he took the soup off the bill. I was really impressed by his service throughout the meal, but that was really above and beyond good service.  I only wish Chelsea's Kitchen was closer!",

The comfort food is nice, though may be a bit overpriced.  A few of the menu items are exactly the same as you'd get at LGO for quite a bit more.  For that reason, If you are heading to Chelsea's... go with the \"Very Special\" section of the menu... no need to have the burgers here.    The short ribs were phenomenal... the mashed potatoes were stellar.  Also tried the Wood Fired Rotisserie Chicken.    Though i went with a friend, i think this would be a pretty good date spot.  If that's whatcher into.  ;)",

    "text": "To me, there are few finer patios in all of Phoenix than the one at Chelsea's!! Great ambiance, good jams and most importantly, yummy food!   So I end up at Chelsea's at least once every two weeks, so I'll highlight some of my favs...   Wine list - yes, their selections are bit pricey, but there are some hard to find bottles on that menu that are simply wonderful!! The Argyle Brut Rose that is only available at Sportsmans etc for half the year is always on the list and it does not disappoint! Bella Glos, Seghesio, Summerland and the Sinister's Hand - what could be better! I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it!   For food - love the shrimp ceviche, although I wish they would ix nay the olives as they are a weird addition, but I just eat around them! Love all the tacos, the prime rib is delish and the rotisserie chicken - TDF! Don't forget your sides too at only $3 each!! How can you skip the french fries (extra crispy, extra ketchup!), mac and cheese and usually the farmer's market veggies?? Fabulous (said like Oprah!)  My most recent discovery yesterday was off the brunch menu - the chilaquiles!! WOW!! It is described as Mexican lasagna, but it is so freaking good and so much more that that! I'm usually part of the clean half your plate club, but this dish I showed no mercy! Amazing!   Andddd, my review of Chelsea's would not be complete without a full nod to my favorite - the brussel sprout salad (add chicken!)! Simple, light, delightful! It really is a gem!   My only knocks are that they don't take reservations for groups of less than 6 or 8 (I can never remember) and it's annoying for the GF BF that their corn tortillas have flour in them (no Chilaquilies for him!). Other than that, it's a dream that I hope to see again very soon!   Don't forget to grab a salty, chewy cookie on the way out!!",

I was shown a small table in the indoor section of the bar and greeted by friendly wait staff. I ordered the green chili burger with kale slaw which was unique and excellent. The burger was more than I could eat and as juicy as any burger could be. The service is excellent and the prices are moderate but fair. I think an outdoor patio seat at the louvered window bar on a nice day must be one of the best places in all of Phoenix to have lunch. The ambience is elegant but not stuffy, prideful of the establishment but not stuffy. I think this is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix and a can't miss for the long run.",

    "text": "We have been back a few more times since my original review, and each time I discover a new dish to love.  When stopping by for lunch, the Husband and I ordered the nachitos - mistakenly thinking that the appetizer would be relatively small... we were SO wrong!  It was so incredibly gigantic that the two of had absolutely no hope in finishing it... even though we were sharing.  Our server was really fantastic and immediately noticed that our speed was slowing down.  He offered to go ahead and box up our carne asada tacos for us to enjoy when we weren't quite as stuffed.  Good call!  The tacos were delectable - even when reheated later that night.   Last night, my sister and I stopped by for dessert.  I am in love with the key lime pie!  The small scoop of strawberry gelato in the perfect foil to the sweet-tart lime.  We also had the chocolate brownie/cake, which my sister devoured.  It wasn't my favorite, but I think I just wasn't in the mood for chocolate (strange, but True).  I also sampled the French Press coffee.  It was really tasty, and I'll definitely order it the next time I'm in for brunch.  Strangely, our waitress forgot to bring out sugar - despite me asking for it after she brought out the carafe of coffee.  Luckily, my dessert was sweet enough to compensate, and I managed to drink my sugar-less coffee anyways.    Chelsea's Kitchen puts out a consistently strong product, has a gorgeous interior and patio - and usually has friendly and attentive service (excusing a few minor glitches... no big deal!).  It is becoming one of our go-to places for a great meal - brunch, lunch, dinner or dessert - Chelsea's has it all!  PS- the free chocolate-chip sea salt cookies were super yummy too!",

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table and the maitre d' comp us with chips and dip.  Three of is ordered the Chilled Shrimp Ceviche which was out of this world. I was expecting raw fish, but it had lots of shrimp with avocado, jicama and tomatoes. My wife had the TUNA TARTARE & GUACAMOLE made with fresh tuna, radish, soy-lemon vinaigrette and another person had the LGO CAESAR salad with whole leaf romaine, reggiano parmesan. The gals ordered a bottle of Pino Noir and two of us had lemonade which was a bit tart, but better than sweeten with sugar. For our entree, I had Chelsea's short ribs which I thought I was going to fight getting the meat off the bone. Surprise, surprise...this was the best tender short rib that I had in my LIFE. It was amazing and tasty. The prime rib and 'filet on the bone' looked \"OH SO GOOD\". There were no complaints whatsoever. The wives had two orders of the roasted chicken and lobster taco. One of the ladies found uncooked chicken towards the bone. She just told the Christina, our waitress and a few minutes later the maitre d' came by and gave her a $20 gift card. We ordered the apple tart and red velvet cake and coffee. The coffee was freshly made at our table with a 'coffee press'.   I was very impressed with the service and the food. We will definitely be back.",
