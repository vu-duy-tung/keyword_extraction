Fries weren't a big proportion like other restaurants but we're definitely alot better quality ingredients and carne asada was cooked to order rather than left under a lamp. The restaurant was clean and the family that runs the place are very nice. Great customer service, I'll definitely be coming back.",

We ordered the asada plate, asada and pastor tacos, birria, chicken quesadilla and Mexican sushi roll. The meats are very flavorful and the house sauce is amazing.  The combination of asada/fried rice/sushi works really well. Definitely one of the best mexican food my family has had.  Drinks wise, we had the limon, pina and of course the bottled coke. Can't beat good ole pina  The male cashier and the lady who brought us the food are very friendly.  The family and I will definitely drop by again when in the Phoenix/Glendale area",

At the time whenever they have shredded cheese and can speak english and I guess I should order it then ??? CarNesAda NacAhOs. THE reason why I said it that way was because my son took my order over the speaker phone, though the lady who's attending the cash register,  who's also the owner and the cook and knows how to speak good English on a good day when she wants to was listing and conversations back and fourth and with my son and about the the food items I'm not allowed to have. The cook put nacho cheese sauce on my carnesada nacho chip . When my son told him and I told him I want queso shredded and the meat . He said we don't have shredded cheese when my son brought the un touch order back up there to them ,and we talk to them on the phone and said we didn't order no super nacho when your wife and my son was talking about my stomach surgery why would I  order a super nacho with nacho cheese.  I also recorded all my   calls and I'm willing to up loaded because. They sat there called the order back and we made sure and They still got it wrong and didn't  want to remake my order with shredded cheese said they didn't have any , saw that the order wasn't touch. The food look disgusting with old running cheese over cook carnesada  meat and every thing but the kitchen sink on it. They didn't refund our money or see if we wanted another menu item or nothing. My son left the food there. It wasn't edible at all.. The first and second time cook just right, the owner lady cooked it really good , she told me a lol about her Resturant ,  third time ran out of queso cheese use sharp cheddar the meat was harsh wasn't season or marinade at all, 4 everything all bad everybody knows you don't put nacho cheese sauce on carnesada meat it cancel out the flavor of the meat unless it's chicken or ground beef or its just plain nasty as he'll. And I want my money back you thieves.",

Their food was exceptional and handmade in every way (except maybe the French fries but they were excellently cooked so I'm happy either way!) Their ingredients are high quality and their attention to detail took our experience from 0 to 100 in seconds. We will go back in a heartbeat and I highly recommend you try it if you haven't already!

The cost was about $12 for everything.  Chips were complimentary. There was a serve yourself salsa bar with vegetables, salsas, lemons and limes. Everything looked fresh and it was cleanBobbi  The tacos were served in a plastic basket,  wrapped in foil, the beans in  styrofoam cups. The house beans were soup like and they were excellent. The tacos were came with only one  thin shell which which made it difficult to hold the filling in. Two shells each would have been perfect, but still they were very good.

The food and the service here are great.   If you want ACTUAL Mexican food come here.  Don't bother with on the boarder, chili's, or whatever Scottsdale is trying to tell you is good.",

Had the shrimp cocktail (AMAZING) and carne asada tacos. The salsa bar is perfect and the customer service is out of this world. We have been to far more expensive \"fancy\" restaurants and didn't get treated as well as we did at Kissi.  A+ quesadillas, too. You'd think most places wouldn't have so much trouble with cheese and a tortilla -- this one is perfect.   We'll be back next week for more!",

We ordered 6 carne asada tacos, 1 fish taco, bottled coke and a coke can....total was under $16 :) The asada tacos come plain but don't worry...there is a salsa bar with different salsas, onions, pico, lime, cilantro, carrots and jalapenos (basically any taco topping you need). Asada meat is great...no fat....A lot of the the other taco places I've been to don't really seem to understand that gristle, is not good. The fish taco came with lettuce, tomato and red onion...very good.  The service is great.....seems family owned and operated....I love that!  This place hit the spot! We will definitely be back!",

I brought so many friends ti try their food because I thought is conveniently located, decently priced and the variety of food is just amazing!   I swear if i was more into yelp in those days i would have check in every time i visited and i would have been won a crown! I have been here a numerous amount of times, enough to say that the quality of food has gone down hill in a spam of a few months.   I have order all their meat tacos, their chilaquines, their hamburgers, their hamburgers (they literally have ham in there; they way they make it in some parts of mexico) their sushi, their nachos, their carne asada fries, their charro beans, hot do combos. and other items i cant recall. I have ordered some of these items at least TWICE. I have ordered all the susi rolls in the menu... And the quality now is just not the one I once bragged about.   When I began to come here it was only a few people said to all be family, now is newer staff and the seasoning among the staff is so different.   For starters the kissi sushi roll (was my favorite) had equal amount of shrimp veggies and rice. Now is mostly rice and less shrimp.. Very disappointing because they were my go-to place. i would call ahead and pick up my order.   Now the customer service is always the highlight of my day. They are great and so friendly.   Now the main reason i will still be coming here is because they have tasty tasty chilaquines, by far the only thing left in the menu that i can still recommend until further notice. They mix a few different sauces and it gives the food a unique taste, reminding me of my home.",

I ordered chicken flautas as I do usually and again I was given beef. This happens so many times it has become a habit. Today what made me write this review and become upset at the fact that they get my order wrong is the amount of time it took to get the food in the first place. Our table waited 30 minutes for our lunch, I then had to wait another 20 for my order. I brought it to the attention of the waitress (the older one who was at the register) and she brushed it off and said we had a lot of orders today. Very unapologetic no excuse for getting the order wrong, time I understand but I am disappointed in receiving been not chicken once again.",

    "text": "Came in wanting a quick burrito, but left feeling like a total glutton and loving it. Kissi is a lovely, unassuming, and inexpensive spot that's the real deal and then some. All that and a bag of chips. Not just a Mexican spot, but...a sushi place!?  Yes. Absolutely. Mexican sushi is a cool new trend that bastardizes Japanese food even better than America does, often incorporating ingredients like grilled chicken and carne asada into a tempura roll. Some are a bit more traditional. My dining companion and I had a pastor burrito and the Ruby Roll, with cream cheese, crab, and shrimp tempura.   The burrito: I really prefer al pastor to lean on the sweet side, but I can admit that it was made pretty well here despite being salty. Some restaurants pair theirs with roasted onions and peppers, but Kissi stuck with beans (very good frijoles that don't overwhelm or act as cheap filler) and guac, which was surprisingly good. They warned me the salsas I chose (get the freaking tomatillo) were spicy, and it was no lie. I could barely handle them, and I can probably take more spice than you. Tread lightly.   The sushi: OMG OMG OMG I don't care if it was basically a dressed up California roll, this is an experience you NEED to have. Each piece was HUGE. Like, too big for anyone to handle in one bite, and meant to be consumed with a fork. There are ten for $10 and I would struggle to finish it. I am an eel sauce fiend, so it was great being handed my own bottle of the stuff as well as spicy mayo and soy sauce to use at my disposal. Gosh I hate having to ask for extra everywhere else! Average sushi invites you to show restraint, admire beauty, and enjoy the atmosphere. This sushi leads you to believe all aesthetics are lies, and True happiness is a big appetite...as well as finishing the side of crab by scooping it with tortilla chips and smothering it in your seemingly infinite supply of Japanese condiments.   Don't you dare judge me, I'm gonna go back and do this again like 20 times.   Can you tell I really enjoyed this place?",

Warm corn tortillas, juicy meat, seasoned to your salsa preference. The salsa bar is slim but don't be deceived because it's absolutely delicious.Sooooo good! The chips are great and the charros are hands-down the best. These beans actually stand on their own they are so good. I think the secret is in the broth. But this isn't soup; its a hearty bean dish and its delicious. I didn't try the sushi but I have to admit I'm intrigued. But oh! The tacos!! Man I miss this place.",

This afternoon, I had the carne asada fries - the best I have ever had. The entire restaurant was packed and the customer service was on point. They give you tortilla chips to eat while they prepare your order fresh and provide access to a salsa bar. The spicy red salsa was the standout when paired with the carne asada fries. Highly recommend if you have never been and are looking for a phenomenal local Mexican spot.",

Service was excellent and they are super friendly.  Also, they have tacos with chicken breast and this is huge because I am a poultry racist.  (I just can't get into dark meat. I've tried.)  If you dine in, they bring you chips that are DELICIOUS.  Perfectly seasoned and the salsa is so good they should sell it.  (In hindsight, I should have asked because I would have loved to take some home.)  My fajita tacos were perfectly seasoned and they serve the tacos \"naked\" which is pretty genius because then you can visit the salsa bar and add to your heart's content.    It's definitely divey, hole-in-the-wall-y but that's okay.  It's just off the 17 and quite convenient.  I will absolutely be coming back.",

The tortillas are homemade, both flour and corn - I tried both of those of course and they're both great, can't lose either way there. And the food being all that it was for me, the service was top notch too. The lady at the register greeted me when I came in and took the time to answer questions I had about deciding what to order. She even walked me through the aguas frescas, letting me have samples. Then a man came out, I think he may own the place, and he was very friendly.

It's different from the traditional sushi I am used to, but I love it.I always get the same roll and it's the kissi roll. It's like shimp tempura, but everything is fried and there's cream cheese in it. It's very good, and super fulfilling. And so cheap because you get huge pieces.  As the Mexico food, ahhhhhh. I love it, too. You start with complimentary chips and salsa, while waiting for your food to come. I usually order the same thing when I come here (I've been here numerous times), the carne asada fries. Hands down best ones I've tried. My boyfriend usually get the tacos, and the tortillas are hand-made so you know those are good. :) Their horchata is also tasty :)  Their customer service is good, too. We've gotten great service and sometimes they give us discounts and free stuff, too :)",

In fact I'm a little irriated it's not already.  4.5+ on Yelp usually leads to little notoriety so thankfully I saw the stellar, spot-on review from Doug T. which lead me to this Phoenix gem.  The P and I were in the Hood visiting her Mother who has lived in the area since the early 70's,  Let me tell you, I'm a whole lot more excited to visit the Mother-in-law now that I know Tacos Kissi is a close-by lunch option.  Lunch consisted of four street tacos, two each of the carna asada and al Pastor.  Both fantastic!  Now keep in mind, these are street tacos, i.e. a couple of bites each-one or two tacos will not fill up a typical male carnivore.  Also, based on a Yelp tip, we went with the Ruby Roll (Mexican Sushi).  I know it's early in the year but I may have already discovered my favorite meal of 2016. Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, fried rice, more tempura- WOW, amazing!  They bring out spicy mayo, soy sauce, and I think hoisin sauce-not sure but I can tell you it was fantastic.  On top of the hoisin sauce I drizzled some of their best-in-class salsa from the salsa bar.  Did someone say Salsa Bar?  Aside from the Pico, the salsa is hot and hotter with some of the  best flavors I've ever enjoyed in any salsa.  Clearly homemade with excellent heat, notes of cilantro and lime- they should bottle it and sell it. The bar also has onions, cabbage, pickled carrots, etc to top your chips and tacos.  Chips, of course, are complimentary.  The service was excellent, very friendly and quick to bring out the food,  The restaurant is spotless, very clean and welcoming.  If you're a taco fan, this is without a doubt some of the best Phoenix has to offer.",

    "text": "I've been going on the west side of town every month but didn't realize Taco Kissi was there until I started Yelpin to find out what's good. Never thought about eating around here cause of the area but what the heck. I'll try anything.   This is a small little taco shop. Very unassuming. I walk in and there is no atmosphere. Bunch of tables with a counter and the menu above. Got a little confused when I first walked in but decided to order the two asada tacos and two pastor tacos with a side of guacamole. Kept on looking for a side of chips but they didn't have it. Oh well. I just got a glass of water and they pull out a plastic up full with ice and pour the water from a water container. Then she tells me they'll bring my water with a bowl of chips. Sweet. Free chips. Nice way to start my meal  Got my water and chips right away and they have a salsa bar with three salsa, pico, cabbage, cucumbers, and lime. Could decide which salsa so I pick the dark and darker salsa. What the heck.   I got my tacos right away and I look at them and I said is that all. Looked so small but after eating everyone I was content.   The asada tacos where so good. I added cabbage, guacamole, and salsa. So good. Really good. Cooked perfect. Juicy. Very flavorful. The guacamole made the taco. Big chunks of guacamole, fresh tomatoes, and fresh cilantro. Oh my goodness. The salsa added that heat. It was out of this world. So good. The pastor tacos were just as good.   Oh yea the chips were very fresh. Very crispy just how I like it. Dip it in the guacamole and it was so darn good. The salsa just just as good. One was hot and the other really hot.   So this place is really good. One of the best tacos shops I've had in the valley. Great tacos. Really good service. Friendly service. The ambience. Let's just say Spanish music playing. A majority of the people are speaking Spanish. Oh yea. It was very clean  Would I come back again. Of course but only during the day time. Got to be careful. Probably take out for my family too. Don't let that scare you. It's my taco heaven right now. Enjoy.",

    "text": "Mexican Sushi? Yeah, it's a weird thought ... but don't let that steer you the wrong way!  Although, I didn't come here for the Mexican Sushi that's so popular I got an order of Carne Asada fries because I haven't had any that are on par with the famous San Jose Iguana's or La Victoria Nacho Fries here. Looking for the next best thing I suppose.  The shop is small, but with ample seating and serves tacos, shrimp cocktail, mexican sushi, dessert and of course carne asada fries. For drinks they have the aguas frescas and soda. Adorned all over the register are small snacks and candies, many of which I grew up eating like De La Rosa Marzipan, Vero Mango, Lucas, all the spicy Tamarindo types and pinwheel chips.  I ordered the Carne Asada Fries and Horchata for about $9, not bad for a large lunch. The fries aren't typical fast food fries and have that little battered type texture around the fries, meat is a bit small in portion. The sour cream and guacamole were scooped neatly on top. A bit plain in my opinion so I topped it with pico de gallo, lime, tomatillo salsa, jalapenos and that spicy mayo that comes on the side of their Mexican sushi. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. Their salsa bar is pretty good, definitely one of the better tomatillo salsa's I've had here. Still definitely better than Filiberto's Carne Asada fries that's for sure! Horchata was good, not too sweet but not the best Horchata I've had in PHX. Definitely needs a little more cinnamon, however still good and you can tell it was made fresh.  The shop is clean, big and the staff is friendly and fast. The only con is that the parking lot is limited and it's on a main road, so dining here during rush hour can be a struggle.",

I drive by this place all the time but didn't want to go in as most small Mexican food places can kill you!  But here it is. The good points: 1.  Gets 4.5 stars from yelp.  That doesn't always mean much.  (There are plenty of 4 star Mexican places that get an F by the health dept).   2.  Health dept is  A rated all the way through.. 3. Went in the place is spotless.  I mean spotless. 4.  It is late Sunday night when most of these places are empty.  This place was packed with customers.  And I don't mean white people snow birds, but real Mexicans--a good sign. Illegals know where to eat. 5.  I called the order in first and the person who answered the phone could speak English. Try that somewhere else.  LOL. 6.  Food was great.  The Mexican sushi was strange but good.  Burrito was very good--better quality  meat than the \"bertos\" chain. NO cheap food here.  Sushi and burrito came to $18, but any restaurant with a fancy building would charge more.  You really need to try this place & takeout is simple and easy.",

We asked the girl working the register as to why is was taking so long and all she could say was there a big order placed over the phone prior to us arriving. We asked why she couldn't have at least told us that it might take longer than usual for our food since there was a large order placed over the phone and she couldn't give us an answer.

I've had a lot of street tacos at many different restaurants around town and these are the best! These tacos are a little larger than average street tacos you get at most restaurants and not only are they generous with the meat but it is seasoned soo well. I liked the fact that you get your choice of corn or flour tortillas, I chose the flour, and I'm sure they are homemade. They also have a fresh salsa bar with several choices (I recommend the tomatillo) as well as fresh cilantro, onion and cabbage. The Kissi Roll was also very good, not as good as the tacos but on a scale of 1-10 I would rate the roll a 7. Very reasonable prices and the restaurant itself is extremely clean and tidy. Needless to say I went back for a second visit today. ;)",

All in all a great little place and one I would come back to. Nothing to look at but good food. I look forward to trying other things on the menu but will probably pass on the asada taco next time.",

I will change my rating if they have better customer service next time. We called ahead so out order would be ready and the girl said it would be about ten minutes. so we show up and she looks very confused. they are looking around and and can't find our order. rather than just admitting they had misplaced our order they secretly went in the back and reordered it after they had asked again what we wanted so they could remember. after it had been fourty minutes and we were in a hurry we just wanted a refund. they said the food was ready and they had other people in front of us and Thalys why it took that long. she also had an attitude and said well I told you 15 to 30 minutes anyway and I simply said no it was 10 and my boyfriend heard as well. but it was fourth minutes anyway. the food still took 10 more minutes after that.",

    "text": "Wow, so good.   We ordered ceviche, the Kissi sushi roll, a taco combo with a mix of tacos, and hochata.   The service was fabulous, very helpful and attentive.  The tacos were great; the shredded beef being my favorite.  The salsas are flavorful.  The ceviche is classic and perfect.  The sushi was fun (although fried sushi is not my favorite sushi style, it was still good).  Their charro beans were great.  Even the horchata was impressive; obviously home-made.  I used to work in El Paso; the tacos and salsas here remind me of what I would get there.  It is surprisingly difficult to find really good tacos in Phoenix, so this is a gem.  Next time I will probably order all tacos, as they were really incredible.  Would be ideal for takeout. The atmosphere is really basic; this is a simple taco shop.  They put their energy into the food, not the decor.  Worth repeat visits.",

I picked carne asada, pastor, and tripas and  they all were delicious. i also ordered a kissi roll which was very good. something slightly different than average sushi but really really good. the portions were good too, especially the kissi roll. i ate the whole plate but id say it would be a dish better shared.

The tacos were perfection in my eyes. The perfect street taco. We each topped them with cabbage and salsa from the salsa bar. The salsa was amazing. We also ordered the ruby roll. It had shrimp and avocado wrapped in FRIED rice. Best idea ever. They brought us a spicy mayonnaise and a soy sauce.. The mayo was to die for. Prices were right, service was great. I'll be back next week!",

    "text": "I arrived here about 6:30 or so on a Sunday evening and was starving. Not sure if I wanted Mexican or sushi, so I decided to give this place a try. I have never had Mexican sushi before, so wasn't quite sure what to expect. I ordered a very large order: a pierna torta ($6 and change) a shredded beef tostada ($3) and a Kissi roll ($9) I was asked if it was for there or go to. When I said here he warned me that it was a lot of food. That was really nice of him, since most places would be like \"score... ordered lots of food and ain't gonna eat half of it' It shows they care about the customer. I did still continue that order. Came out to $20 even after tax (before tip) I then proceeded to the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo, and three different types of salsa to have with their chips. The pico was amazing, and the green and red were both very flavorful. The brown was flavorful too, just a bit spicy. The chips were delicous.... crunchy but still soft.... i do believe they are homemade. My tostada arrived first, fully loaded with goodness. It was huge! Just after the tostada I was starting to fill up fast. My torta arrived before I was able to finish the tostada and came with some fries. I ate about half of it and knew that I was in danger of not having any room to try the sushi. The torta was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again simply because I think the tostada was better. My sushi arrived and I was only able to eat 3 bites of it before I was full. Those three bites were amazing tho! I highly recommend this place.... Even though the rolls are $9, it is technically 2 rolls.... it is 12 pieces. Very large pieces. And it also comes with some crab salad on the side and a bottle of spicy mayo and a sort of teriyaki sauce for you to put on top and customize. This place is all about giving you custom food and at a fairly decent price. They are very kind and even tho the place looks a bit run down from the outside, is nice. Next time I will probably just get the roll and a tostada and maybe try a taco.",

I know that seems ridiculous considering how much good food there is in this city, but it's that this place has all of the right things. Friendly staff, variety of fresh and unique Mexican food, ridiculous prices, and a really nice salsa bar.   For the first few months I was coming we would only get tacos, the birria and cabeza are my favorite. I always thought the idea of Mexican sushi was a little off, but then I gave it a shot and it's really good. Tempura shrimp with creamy sauces, the kissi roll is legit.   The truth is I would come here twice a week if I lived on this side of town. We always come on Sunday's after church, you should check it out.",

Al pastor was by far the best meat of the three. Great flavor, a little crispy on the outside. Carne asada had a nice smokey flavor that I appreciated but I would have preferred for it to be a little crispier on the outside. I will honestly say that my favorite part about this place was their tortillas. I got the flour tortillas on the tacos and they were the perfect texture for these tacos. Great salsa bar as well. My only complaint is the size of the tacos. I understand that street tacos are generally going to be on the smaller side but I can literally eat like 10 of these tacos, and that would put my meal around $20 bucks. Anyways, I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

They serve the most authentic and fresh Mexican food at an affordable price. They have your classic mexican dishes, aguas frescas, and desserts, they also serve thriftys ice cream as well. My only con is their customer service, isn't bad but, it can be inconsistent.  Other than that if your looking for something quick, authentic, and reasonably priced then I highly reccomend them.",

The owner asked me how it was and i told him my honest opinion; \"the pastor was extremely dried.\" His response \"you should know the pastor was going to be dried, next time put more lemon to soften it.\" Rude and just arrogant. Pastor is not supposed to be dried. Anyways... i live close by but it wont me my go to Mexican. Will rather got to El Pastorcito or Salsitas on 43rd and Indian School.",

You have the option to call in orders,super convenient, they have till today never messed up an order. I have tried there: Tostada with carne Desebrada which comes with Consome,Bomb!  The Sopes are also delicious, my boyfriend's fave. The Cocktail de Camaron also the bomb BUT my FAVORITE of all their Taco Combos which come with 4 tacos of your choice(homemade tortillas corn or flour, add cheese for $1), a side of Frijoles Charros(yaassss) and a med drink(horchatas my fave, the real deal aguas none of that fake powdered stuff)is the most filling and delicious combo I've had from any taco spot.  Ooh n not to mention there snack options, Mexican candy, fresas con crema, flan etc. They also sell tortillas de harina, for those of us who don't have our abuelitas or moms close to hook us up, these are the next best thing. If your thinking about going here I definitely recommend it you will not be disappointed.  All the staff is super nice including the Manager n his Wife their there almost every time I go and are super amables.",

The salsa bar has all the necessities,  the pico had a fresh and clean taste. I also had jamaica (hibiscus punch) to drink,  it's the best I've had outside of Mexico.  The staff was very friendly.

But this does it as it should be. They use Angus beef for asada tacos, they shred their own cheese, have handmade tortillas, fry their own chips, make the salsa fresh evetyday with a salsa bar, homemade lemonade,  cocktail shrimp is delicious have a sweet flavor that reminds me of a homemade only flavor.   Tacos were also great! I had the tacos de pastor and cabeza. The pastor was sweet and spicy great grill taste paired with their tomatillo salsa. The cabeza was extremely tender, just like mom can only make.    I wish the best for this place. Try it you won't be disappointed.",

The burrito was tasty but the carne asada was chewy and had hard bits in it which was rather unpleasant. The taste was okay but nothing to write home about. The sushi was... Odd. It appeared to be deep fried and has cream cheese in it. It wasn't necessarily bad and I might have eaten more than one piece if it wasn't for the chewy carne asada. The horchata was delicious and I could see myself stopping in just for that. The salsa bar really impressed me. It was well stocked and fresh and the pico de gallo was probably the best I have ever had. It is obviously homemade. The restaurant was exceptionally clean and the staff were very friendly. I will probably return to try something different.. I have to have that horchata and pico again :)",

    "text": "I have lived a half mile away for almost a year...I have been missing out on this hidden gem! Went in today and ordered the tacocombo and asada fries.   The tacocombo includes four tacos, charro beans, plenty of onion and cilantro and a drink. They allow you to get different meat options for the tacos. You can also choose flour or corn tortillas. I picked chicken fajita, shredded beef and two asada tacos all on flour tortillas. The chicken fajita was all white meat and seasoned well, not dry. It did not include any veggies, but did not disappoint. The shredded beef was a generous portion of juicy beef. The asada was my favorite. It was seasoned well and it was meat, not fat and gristle. The beans were amazing, flavorful and included bits of bacon. Even the drink was delicious. They offer a variety of aguas frescas. I went with limonada or limeaide and it was the perfect balance of sweet,  tangy and refreshing, not at all bitter which can easily happen if this drink is not prepared correctly.   The asada fries were good, a bit salty and not as generously portioned as I'm used to. However, the fact that they use seasoned fries made up for the size. The same delicious asada meat is included as well as lots of cheese, sour  cream and green salsa which is a delicious avocado based salsa.   They also have a delicious salsa bar, we added Pico de gallo to everything, pretty standard but good. I also opted for a molcajete salsa which was very flavorful, not too spicy.  I'm so glad I went in this afternoon. I seriously considered going in for more tacos for dinner tonight. It's that good...and I have to make up for lost time. Try this place, you will not be disappointed.",

We are big fans of this place there Carna Asada tacos are one of my favorite as well as their shredded beef tacos.

The first time I actually didn't try a sushi roll (tight on cash...blame teachers' salaries).  I enjoyed some shrimp tacos (limited options for a pescatarian, unfortunately) and a cup of elote!  It was delicious.  Lots of salsas at the condiment bar, too.  The second time I did order some sushi, though I forget which roll.  I also had a cocktail de camaron, which was super yum.  The sushi was OK.  I didn't see how it was \"Mexican,\" though it was fried and a little heavy on the cream cheese.  I'd like to try another.  Next time.    Service, over the course of two visits, was fine.  They took my order and brought my food to the table.  That's about as far as it went.  Price is pretty good, too.  A dollar or two less would be nice, but as is is totally fair :)  Environment is almost nil.  There are neutral colored walls and floors with relatively nondescript seating.  The one thing that does stand out is the counter of Mexican candies next to the cash register.  This place is a mile away, so next time it's not over 90 and I have some money, I'll hit them up again.",

It's every bit as delicious as it sounds, the co-mingling of two wonderful food cultures produces another gorgeous mixed child of love! #lovekillsthedemon Just try it already, it's delicious. I'm a huge fan of agua fresas if they're done right and they scoop some chunky pineapple water made with love to wash down even the spiciest of their awesome street tacos, which you can get with flour tortillas if you're so inclined. The Al Pastor and shrimp tacos are my favorites here but they all look good. If you are a huge fan of the Sonoran Dog as I am, you will not be disappointed. The thing that most impressed me was the coconut pineapple ice cream. I was transported back to The mid to late 90s, when I was in my mid to late 20s and eating my way up and down the streets of Acapulco and Mazatlan. Seriously people, street vendor quality creaminess with chunks of fresh fruit! Give this place a shot, not all Taquerias are built alike. This ain't no \"Berto's\" and that ain't no bull!",

I just don't understand why my experience was so different than the other 94 reviews I read that brought me here in the first place. I spent $30 for two people. This included 4 street tacos (so incredibly tiny, two should truly be one), two tostada ceviche, and 1 Mexican sushi roll (each $9.99).  I enjoyed the tostada, should have just ordered 3 of them and called it a day. It wasn't the best but it was adequate for the price or maybe just so much more enjoyable then the other items we selected.  The sushi Mexican roll, although very creative, tasted like a grease roll and I was not a fan despite all the raving reviews. It isn't sushi at all. It is a roll but they should really call it something else. I was expecting sushi ... that was not sushi. The tacos were raved about in other reviews, I wasn't impressed. The place is a semi bad area of town, that doesn't bother me, its a walk up to counter and order, that doesn't bother me ... it was just the food that bothered me.   I tried it once, won't be back. It just wasn't satisfying. I am the first person to praise any little non-commercialized business but just not this place.",

We ordered four tacos (carne Asada and al pastor) and two orders of sushi (kissi roll and rubi roll) all to go. Nice people working there and very attentive! We will be back!",

    "text": "Absolutely the BEST!!!! I Seriously come here all the time, at least twice a week. This is in no way a hit-or-miss kind of place, there food is consistently delicious.   Being from Mexico (Baja), I am incredibly picky when it comes to tacos... I moved here back in the summer of '05 and this is the only place in all of Arizona where the tacos, from the taste of the meat to the wonderful salsas, taste just like the ones from back home.   When you dine in, they always bring you some free chips, and there salsa bar has a great variety of yummy topping to throw on their already yummy food.   And guess what? If you're a sushi fan, I have had two different rolls so far and they are both AMAZING!   Besides all the culinary masterpieces, the family that owns this small business are the most kindhearted and hard-working people I have ever met. Go and you will not be disappointed.   A mis amigos hispanos: Si quieren unos tacos como los de casa, las mejores salsas, y el mejor servicio, TIENEN QUE IR! Despues de comer en Tacos Kissi, preparense para los antojos todos los dias!! Jajaja...",
