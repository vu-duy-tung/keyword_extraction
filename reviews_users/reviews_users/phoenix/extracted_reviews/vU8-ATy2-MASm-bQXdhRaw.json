Its just good reasonably priced takeout. The Ahwatukee location is actually closer to home but this one is more on my way home so I am happy I finally tried to give it a try. They were super quick with my order, got everything right and very friendly.",

The quality of the roll was less than something you would expect to get at a convenience store. The mango was almost non-existent and the small piece that I did find was so unripe, it was inedible.  The worst part is that the server that came to our table to remove our plates asked if there was anything wrong with the sushi. I told him it was really terrible and he gave a knowing smile and said that they knew it was bad and that it had not been working out the way they had hoped.  That made me so mad because they know it is bad but they are still selling it to their loyal customers.    Shame on you, Pei Wei.    They are also misleading on their online menu. It says in the description that the rolls are made to order, but I tried to get them without cucumber and was told that I couldn't get it that way because they were pre-made.  Another slap in the face from Pei Wei.",

Veggies are crisp and light, meat is juicy and cooked to order, and rice is cooked well in industrial rice cookers throughout the day and night. All flavors are elevated due to freshness. Doesn't get much better!  I will agree with the bit about inconsistency; I do think this has to do with nothing being pre-cooked, and find the inconsistency to fall on deaf ears since the cuisine is so well though out.",

Today was my friend's birthday and we ordered lettuce wraps and 2 entrees. Entrees came first (with the wrong rice on one) and lettuce wraps after the entrees.

If you hate your job that much, you should look for another one. Management: you should be aware of this, and correct that. Now we are going to the one on Baseline in Gilbert/Mesa, where service; yes, service in a Pei Wei, is very good. They care, they pay attention, they are happy to see and serve you. Anyway, the Wok salad was good, which explains the One star; but bye bye Pei Wei on Guadalupe and Mc Cormick, you will never see me again.",

    "text": "First of all I would like to say Pei-Wei is a good chain if you compare to the quality of other places of it's kind.  I walked in for lunch, and was surprised that they had brown rice. So I thought I could get a healthy meal, but I was wrong...  I talked to the worker at the front for 5 min, and asked her if there is a healthy (no oily/greasy) style way of making the dish. Unfortunately, we established that there was no way to do this.  Why have the brown rice option if you can't order the dish itself in a healthy way?     I ordered the Pei Wei style chicken, and I waited for the food to come. 15 min later I finally got it. Keep in mind there was no one behind in line, and one person ordering from the \"take out\" line. I watched  the whole process go down. The main chef put my plate down on the counter in the kitchen, and the \"salad chef\" was supposed to garnish it with a simple rosemary/parsley addition. That hand off took an extra 7 minutes.... It seemed to me that there was arguing,  and disorderly production behind the counter.  My other complaint would be that the dinner portion which not that large is kinda of pricey.  The plate looks huge when it comes out of the kitchen, but  the Plate comes with 75% rice, and 25% meat so don't be fooled.   Why would you want to eat that kind of protein/carb ratio?    I cannot order the lunch plate because it would not come with enough meat.",

The first thing you will notice is there is no broth.  There is a tiny bit on the bottom but not a significant amount.  Overall there was enough meat and shrimp but for $10  there better be.  The problem with this came from the taste.  It is on the spicy side so if you don't like it spicy you have been warned.  The noodles were a bit on the stiff side.  Kind of reminded me like the type of noodles you would get from a pizza place that had their noodles sitting in the fridge over night.    To cover up for the lack of flavor it looks like they tried to mask it using a spicy red chille sauce.  I have had better tasting top ramen then this dish.  I have had real ramen before and I consider this an insult to my taste buds.  I would have been happy with this dish even with no broth if it tasted good.  My advice is if you want your Mongolian or king pao chicken then you are fine.  If you want a noodle dish I would recommend going to one of the new more authentic ramen places in the Valley.",

When the order was rung up, it wasn't giving me the correct discount. The cashier argued with me at first that I was receiving the discount, but the math wasn't adding up. The items on the ticket matched the coupon and, it wasn't working. She asked if she should go to the manager, and I said yes. I was only coming to Pei Wei today because of the 33% off. That's a great discount!   The manager was very snotty about the situation. He refused to come to speak with me and kept saying, \"I have no control over that. I don't issue the coupons. Corporate does.\" He said that 3 times. Then, he said, \"if you want to give her a 25% discount, do it\". I had a coupon that stated I should receive 33% off. The cashier came back and repeated what he said and said \"I can give you a 25% discount, if you want\". Why in the world would I want a 25% discount if I have a coupon from Pei Wei offering 33% off? I told them to cancel my order and I won't be back. The manager's attitude was appalling! If corporate Pei Wei offers 33% off, you are still responsible to honor it. The coupon didn't say, \"well, hey, if the manager of a Pei Wei doesn't issue the coupon and corporate does, be prepared for 25% off.\" It said 33% off!  There was a way that the manager could have handled this correctly. He could have offered something that made up the difference like a free little appetizer or anything, but he made no attempt to fix the issue and acted very exasperated as if I should be ashamed of myself for expecting them to honor the coupon. Seriously???   I've been a customer of Pei Wei for more than a decade. I WILL NOT BE BACK. This was some of the worst customer service I have ever received. The manager really needs to learn customer service and maybe take some anger management classes.",

There were two other customers sitting together at a table. The rest of the restaurant was empty. I stood at the pick up station for 10 minutes while three staff members looked directly at me and continued to ignore me. Finally, one worker came over and was very confused about my order even though it was already sitting on the table since before I arrived. She told me the total was $18.36 which matched my online emailed receipt. I paid her with a $20. She then freaks out when as I'm waiting for my change and says she pressed that I gave her $40 when I gave her $20. She yells for the manager about three times. On the third time the manager finally looks over and tells her to wait. The manager eventually makes it over to us and proceeds to be rude to me and says that my total is $20.65. I said \"no, my online order is $18.36, and the young lady had even rang me up for that total.\" The manager replies \"that's not what it says on our end, you owe us another .65 cents\"  I was frustrated beyond words. I am shocked a manager would act in such a manner and make a mistake like this!Rather than exchange angry words, I just turned around and left quietly. What's happened to this peiwei? It used to be one of the best.",

Let just say the noodles were like reheated Ramon, very sad.  Every other Pei Wei we go to no problems. But here I can remember at least 6 times. Usually we are in a hurry with kids so we get it to go but tonight we actually had time so we dined in. From the moment we walked in we already felt a bad vibe. It looked like the cooks were about to go at it and the cashier was trying to be clam about it.  So we ordered our food we wait with the kids and then it's taking awhile. We noticed there were no cooks cooking then Tempe fire dept comes with there crew code 3  with tools  and medical  equipment. The first thing I thought was they mush have a had a fight that went south. But I believe someone got injured on the equipment in the back who knows how but Fire was there for a long while. After 45min my wife went back up there to get a refund. It was a pain in the butt but it seems like we never have any good luck here. It seems like the cashiers here are always stress and they are understaffed with the amount of people coming in.  We always see people complaining about how their food is wrong or price while waiting to pick up their meal.  Not to mention we always here were out of this or that.  Sounds like it's a management problem to me.",

I don't want to update my review on Guadalupe Pei Wei, I want to write another review so users can see how consistently bad the restaurant is. Anyhow, this Pei Wei stunk it up again. I ordered Spring Rolls and they came without sauce. What the heck's a spring roll without the sweet sauce? My wife's ahi avocado salad didn't come with crunchy wontons. NO CUNCH! This place is severely challenged. I think the new manager hires clueless workers so he comes off as competent in comparison. Why do I go back? What is the matter with me? Soon, I'll get my pre-written apology from Pei Wei that doesn't even work properly when you try to respond to manager, who must be the most clueless person in the building.",

The guy who took my order forgot to give me a table number, and so the waitress accidentally gave my food to someone else. The giant party and everyone else who ordered after me got their food before I got mine, and I ended up waiting 40 minutes for 1 thing. I was with my boyfriend chatting otherwise I would have complained sooner. Once I brought this to the attention of the food runner, she was like, \"oh whoops I gave your food to someone else. Sorry\". My food then came out promptly, but really? That's it? Sorry?? Like if the guy forgot to give me a table number then he should have run after me with one, or told the food runner that I was the customer who didn't have a number. I was already having a long day and was really hungry. It just seemed rude not to care that I didn't get my order of one item for over half an hour.",

When I received the dish i got it with meat in it and told the waitress that I ordered it with tofu not chicken because i am a vegetarian.  so she took it back and said they will remake it with tofu and brought me a new dish so I start eating it and then found a piece of chicken in it.  I disregarded it and threw that out and packed up the rest because I lost my appetite and thought it was only one piece, So I went to work after and decided to eat the leftovers for dinner and I found 6 more pieces of chicken in the dish!! This infuriates me because I ordered the dish paid extra for the noodles and everything and they made it wrong and just took the chicken off the top and added tofu to it.  They did not remake the dish and clearly did not care about customer service or anything. They were to cheap and lazy to get a new plate out, add fresh noodles and then add the remade tofu on top. I paid extra for the noodles anyways but I was not able to get the right dish and the staff was inconsiderate.",

I've noticed several very troubling reviews as of late, but since I had not personally had a bad experience it didn't prevent me from going back.  Until tonight.  Placed a $32 online order and waited 30 minutes to go pickup.  The moment we walked in the door it was obvious something was very wrong.  Very few people in the restaurant, but there were at least 12 tables uncleaned and covered in dirty dishes.  The fountain drink machine was empty on multiple drink selections, the wonton cookie bin was empty on the self service area, the cashier was telling customers there would be at least a 15-20 minute wait for their food.  The restaurant was clearly understaffed with one cashier for dine in and take out, one cook, and a couple people walking in and out of the back.  MOST concerning was that nobody seemed to really care.  We waited for 45 minutes and in that time not a single item from our \"take out\" order was ever prepared.  The cashier started turning guests away, and finally put a sign on the door saying they were no longer taking any orders.  They started calling customers that had placed online orders and telling them they wouldn't be able to make the food.  It was only 6:30pm on a Sunday night and the cook just started shutting down the kitchen.  After 45 minutes of seeing a situation go from bad to worse, it was apparent we weren't going to get ANY of the food we paid for.  So, I asked the cashier if I could just get a refund.  He promised that he would cancel my order and I would receive a credit to my card.  Hope he's right.  Multiple other guests who had been waiting on their food started to give up as well.  I suspect they just closed the entire restaurant by around 7pm.  These events are just too significant to ignore so I won't be returning.  I hope they can't things back on track.",

I keep coming back because I like having their cauliflower rice as an option. Today, I stupidly waited 20 minutes in line (because the young woman is really slow and I know this), only to find that they literally have no cauliflower rice and have been having this problem for a while. And instead of telling the ridiculously long line that they're out? They just wait until each of us get to the front and say, \"yeah, lots of people are upset.\"",

We had a really good meal that was actually made when you order it and have lots of customizations that would never happen correctly at 99% if other Asian food restaurants.  The difference between here and panda is not even comparable- yet the price is about the same.   We even messed up and ordered fried shrimp rather than steamed - they were super nice and brought out seamed shrimp for no charge!  Btw both the fried and steamed shrimp are gluten free!  Great service, open kitchen so no funny business- what more do ya want?",

    "text": "First time eating here because the rating on the prices were said to be different than Panda Express. They seem to be about the same price when you order your drink and additional sides. It may be a bit more.   My interaction with the cashier was very pleasant. She was very helpful helping me decide on what to order. I was on a budget trying to decide what to get and I'm surprised she did not give me any attitude with the remarks I made about the constant changes I made trying to deal with my price range.  The service seemed to be okay. The manager seemed to be bringing everyone there meals. I had a question about the types of chili to have with my meal so I see one of the guys in the black uniforms who I noticed delivered some of the food out to the guests.  I look over at him and he notices me staring. I was hoping he would come up to me and help me out with finding some siracha because with Pei Wei being an asian restaurant I was hoping they would have some. He then turns away from me so I have to walk all the way to the counter to ask him if they had any. He answers my question very rudely and turned away.  It made me feel pretty stupid asking a question like that but then again it made me quite angry. I walked away and did nothing about it.   Every person interacting with a guest should be willing to help them out with any questions they have. If it weren't for the helpful cashier I would have given a one star rating.  Food was actually really good as well.",

Now you pick a protein and a sauce. No more combos :(  I decided to have chicken with spicy Korean sauce and brown rice. We also shared an order of lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were as expected. My dish came out and it didn't look like what I expected, but I was hopeful and waited until James got his to dig in. I took a bite of the chicken and whatever flavoring was nonexistent. It was not spicy and really had no taste. I added some soy sauce to the brown rice and for brown rice, it didn't taste good either. I ended up taking just a few bites and leaving the rest. I will reluctantly give them a second chance since I did try something new, but I really wouldn't recommend what I got to anyone.",

    "text": "I was looking for something light for dinner after shopping at the Trader Joe's across the street. I stopped here and ordered the Korean steak lettuce wraps. I was expecting small strips of steak with a spicy sauce and some veggies and a stack of iceberg lettuce to wrap the filling with. The first surprise was that the beef was just coarsely ground meat, not strips of beef. The second surprise was the sauce. It was not spicy, but it was oily. The veggies did seem fresh. The portion was just right for a light dinner and was a little over $8 with tax.   The ordering process was odd. You stand in a line and place your order with a person behind a counter (not intuitive since the cash registers are not visible). The take-out area is part of the same section of counter, so it feels confusing and cluttered with people milling around waiting for take-out while other people are placing their orders. The kitchen is open and once you place your order you are supposed to figure out where to go next. I walked into the open dining area to look for a table and stopped by the soda station to get a glass of water. I couldn't find the napkins. I found a table and put my number on the table. A young man brought my food to the table once it was ready and got me some napkins (it turns out they were toward the back of the soda station). When I was done I couldn't figure out where to put my trash and plate. I watched for a few minutes and looks like they have staff to bus the tables. So this seems to be some hybrid between fast food self-serve and a sit-down restaurant.  The place seems clean. The staff was polite but I never saw a smile nor welcoming word from anyone. Parking is close to the door. I'm not sure there is anything here to prompt me to return.",

The orange-citrus tea isn't so great. But they have fortune cookies in the middle of the condiments corner that aren't stale!!",

They were way over cooked. Somebody needs so fryer training!  The restaurant was not busy at the time. This is just sloppy food prep. As for the sushi...very average at best.  1) The California mango roll...don't waste your time. The mango cannot be tasted nor seen. We did not order this but we got it and paid for it. 2) All 4 rolls were different in size. Consistency is the key to good food prep. Why the disparity of sizes? 3) The crunch rolls (2) were the best of what we got and they are on a limited basis... We spent $37 on dinner for two and they served us cheap plastic cutlery. Very disappointed. If you are going to advertise your food as upscale your accoutrements should be as well.  Overall a very disappointing experience and I will not go back. I bought into all the hype in marketing and advertising...I would have preferred a better more professionally prepared meal. I don't think there was anyone in the kitchen over 21 years old...high turnover? In any case better training is needed.",

    "text": "Terrible performance from a chain I like so much.  After placing my order online, and scheduling it for a little later today, I showed up. I was a couple minutes early so I expected to wait a minute or two.   The cashier tells me he will bag my order up right away and turns around. I'm waiting and see what I think to be my entree and he then proceeds to do some expo work putting other orders together.   \"Okay, its dinner time surely there are other orders and he's just about to get to mine!\" Nope.... After about 5 min of waiting at the register I decide to take a seat just as the cashier finally turns back around. \"Perfect, he's got it ready and I can get out of here because I'm already running late!\" Nope.... He walks straight passed me.  So I sit down again and start waiting..... and waiting. Not a word from cashier or another employee who may have been the manager.   10 min later, as I finally stand up to ask where my food is the cashier walks right past me again. Fortunately, he comes back with a box that turns out to be part of my order!  Finally, he starts bagging my order and he does what I was really hoping he wouldn't.... That entree that was sitting on the counter, away from any source of heat, is in fact mine, and it's been sitting there longer than I have at this point.  Cashier hands me my order and tells me to have a good night. Well, it's not off to a good start...   I get back to the office and am finally ready to enjoy some good food (if not a little cold) from a place I always love! Nope...  Chicken Chow Mein; Boiled noodles lacking any type of a sauce piled on top of veggies (carrots, onion, spinach & garlic). Now I get it, it's been at least 30min since this came out of the wok so temperature is nobody's fault. BUT! The veggies were next to raw. I don't mean cold. The spinach hadn't even wilted! Maybe they spent a couple seconds in the wok. Extra fun when you find ground garlic, an ingredient generally mixed throughout the dish to season (at least that's what any cook has ever told me), in a single pile, and again completely RAW!  If this is some new concept where I pay a place for the ingredients and then take them home to cook them please let me know!  The chicken had the opposite problem. Seemed pretty clear it had been cooked before being cooked again (or warmed up) for my meal. Dry, tough, unseasoned, just like everyone does not like it!  Fortunately, the egg rolls (the ones that took an extra 10 min to cook after I showed up) were decent at best, but I guess it's tough to mess up something that comes to the store frozen.  I get it! I've spent plenty of time in the restaurant industry to know not every meal or experience is perfect, but you have to at least put in the effort to attempt to make it that way! I'm not mad. I'm just very disappointed.  Hopefully, this place turns it around. Certainly by the looks of this place now that I check the Yelp scores it seems there are many issues to be fixed and I am not the first complaint.  Hopefully I hear something from somebody that gives me some hope about this place.",

Don't pay the extra $4 it's exactly the same size.  3)when you show up after calling to make sure the confirmation email was wrong and are assured the rest of your order is on the ticket and is read back to you, it's infuriating to arrive and find they only show an appetizer in their system, reorder and wait for them to make it 4)kids meals are a joke, 3 pieces of chicken crammed in a small box full of noodles  The advertising campaign about orange chicken is laughable, Panda Express is better in so many ways. Which is sad because Pei Wei and this location used to be good. How can a \"fast food\" place like Panda Express be Pei Wei's prime competition?",

    "text": "We haven't been back to Pei Wei in a while since they made some serious menu changes and things seemed to have gone down hill. Today it was more out of convenience than anything else that I actually went back.  The staff were friendly enough and I placed my order very quickly, but since it was before the typical lunch rush would begin there were very few of us in the place. The things I noticed though before my lunch arrived began to trouble me. First was the doors to the restrooms, they were filthy! The restrooms themselves were clean enough, but the doors looked like they were from an old service station; covered with greasy dirt on both sides.  Once I sat down and began looking about the dining area, which appeared clean at first glance, began to show it's True state. Carpets that were badly in need of a \"bisselling\", spots under the tables that showed that the tables had not been moved when the floors were cleaned, the stainless steel was a mess and the soda machines were an absolute disgrace. When I went to take a bottle of soy sauce off of the shelf all of the bottles were filthy and actually stuck to the shelf!  In the same line the wood work and the window sills had not been dusted in a very long time. and the more I looked about me the more details I came across that should have been taken care of by an observant staff.  When I told the manager of some of my observations he did in fact take all of the soy bottles into the back to be cleaned and he came out and cleaned the shelf himself. A good first step actually.  All that being said the food was pretty good, which was really a surprise. And that's a good sign too.",

Only one person taking orders and one person delivering food to tables and cleaning up the tables. There wasn't one table clean inside. When I told the order taker, he suggested I just go outside! I looked on the patio, and all the tables outside were also dirty. There were at least 8 tables with dishes left on them and the rest were not wiped off. I asked to have a table wiped off. She did a quick job and left crumbs on the table and in the chairs. The bathroom was also in need of attention. One of the toilets was terribly backed up. The silverware on the counter was dirty, all the forks had rice on them!  We elected to use plastic. Not a good experience and our last time to eat here.",

Believe me, compared to the person I placed my Bento order with here today (which somehow got from its list price of $9.99 to $20.95!) Zachary would have never made any of the errors that person made and you wouldn't have had to repeat \"for here\" 3 times!

One entree and the edamame was incorrect and the adolescent staff working had no clue how to fix it. I didnt see anyone resembling a manager on the floor to ask for help so i waited until they made it correctly. In the span of 5 minutes they messed up our order, forgot the sauce for the appetizers next to us that the lady requested 3 times, and never made an online order that someone came to pick up. Need better management presence, or at least a manager presence. Wont be back for awhile if at all.",

I've waited 30 to 45 minutes for an order that I placed online. I received Orange Chicken with Veggies with no Veggies. I received food with no sauce.  So we've been going to Casa Paloma Pei Wei and it's been worlds worlds better. Today however I was shopping in the same area and decided to try this location again. I placed my order online for a Bento Box for pickup. When I got there only one person was working both counters so I waited about 5 minutes. My food was ready though so that was good. Once waited on, the girl counted my money wrong and proceeded to give me 9.99 back and she thought I was a penny short. Whatever.  She could have asked me if I had more change. Then got home to eat.  Rolls didn't taste fresh. Miso salad had no dressing. Wonton had no sauce. Chicken had two good size pieces and then a bunch of tiny tiny fried hard pieces. Also there was some black stringy thing in my chicken.  NEVER AGAIN.   It's sad because this location used to be very good.",

    "text": "I have mixed emotions about this place. I came in a belt 4 days ago with my boyfriend. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps with a cup of , wonton soup and he ordered the orange fried shrimp with rice I believe.   OMG LET ME tell you the chicken lettuce wraps are absolutely phenomenal literally every single bite was mouth watering. A really nice soy sauce salty flavor with white meat chicken, mushrooms, water chestnuts, scallions and , garlic sever with this crispy stuff with nicly cut lettues perfect for scooping the yummy delicious chicken. The wonton soup was just equally good nice and savory broth.   This is were thing changed. I came back yestarday and decided to try something new on the menu. I went with the chicken Thai mango at the recommendation of the woman who took my order. I asked for it to be extra spicy I also ordered the crab lagoons and the hot and sour soup with a glass of wine.   I sat at the bar area. The whole entire time I was there I was not greeted by one employee. Nobody asked how it was doing if I was enjoying my food or if I needed anything. In fact I had to flag the waiters down multiple times. Once for napkins the second time for silverware and the third time to get a glass of water.   I did not enjoy the thia mango whatsoever.  The chunks of meat are absolutely huge way too big. The whole entire dish was drowning in peanuts I pulled out at least 45. The veggies were not soft at all they're very hard. And this sause was not spicy at all.   I only eat a few bites. The lettuce that I got was absolutely horrible it look like they just ripped a patch off it off it was so mangled that I couldn't even eat it as a wrap which is very disappointing.   The crab lagoons on the other side where the highlight of my meal they had a very generous amount of crap and the yummy sweet topped it off. I also had the hot and sour soup which was good had a nice thick consistency.  I feel like for spending $21 the customer service was not up to par nor the food/ particular  menu item i ordered.  I would consider coming back but I'll probably only get  lettuce wraps I'm scared to try something different and not like it again.",

The next thing I got was the chicken pad Thai. Firstly I was not expecting tofu in this considering it's chicken but that was my fault for not asking the ingredients. After picking out all the tofu and tasting the dish I was deeply disappointed. There was almost NO FLAVOR! The most I got was lime juice from the lime I squeezed on top. No spice no sauce flavor. It was bland and not worth the money. I couldn't take more than 5 bites before giving up on it. Not happy.",

When I asked, she said that they ran out. She said that she was new and it was busy, to go online and submit a comment.   Turns out that you can not submit a comment on their site, you are told to contact the store. I contacted the manager the next day and was told that there was nothing they could do. I just had the charge post and i'm submitting a charge back.   They should have contacted me about the missing items or told me when I went to pick up the order. They least they could have done is offered some kind of compensation, instead they charged me for items they could not provide.",

Hot & Sour soup is more like Hot & Salty soup.   Because I've never been to other Pei Wei, this 2 stars rating is only for Guadapupe location Diner Select dishes. the price range for their Dinner Select is $6.25 to $7,  you can get same price & better taste even at many other Chinese Buffet, like Hunan 8 in Mesa (Gilber/60),lunch & dinner same price exclude Sunday,  or Yummy Buffet in Chandler for lunch (Alma/Walner). or Lin's buffet, $8 lunch, you can get salmon; deep fry shrimp.

The appetizer came out and was only warm and wasn't as good as usual. You could hear and see customers complaining and getting refunds all over the place. The staff all seemed confused. My entree finally came out, also not hot, but my girlfriends didn't show up for another 10 minutes.  All during this they kept going to the wrong tables with food and looking confused.  It was crazy, finally gave up, got a refund from the manager and went next door for dinner.  I won't be returning here again.",

I got the lettuce chicken wraps, the PW Spicy chicken and the beef green curry with brown rice. Everything was good---just like you would get at an above average chain restaurant. I got the take out, and the hostess was really polite--she took the time to ask if I wanted condiments or utensils. I am mentioning that because it happened to be 31st Dec night, and the place was pretty packed. I actually quite liked the beef green curry! Think I'll add this place to my list of go-to restaurants for when I am craving Chinese fast food, and don't want to shell out $$ for PF Chang-like fare.",

There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.    I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum.",

Thankfully, my meal was insect and hair free, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about it. I had the crab won-tons which were virtually tasteless.. My Pad Thai the same, I had to load it up with lime and rooster sauce for there to be anything to wrap my tongue around. However, my friend had the Mandarin Kung Pao, and it was yummy. I ate more of that than my own meal. To me it is just quick chain food that I could easily buy in a frozen package and throw in my wok for about half the price. One thing I will say is that their staff is eerily friendly, and I don't know if it was my extremely enormous Asian inspired tattoo that they were mesmerized by, but I was asked how I was doing at least 10 times, by several different dining room attendants.. Ill give them that, and their orange tea.. I could drink that for days.",

When I received my order in the dining room, I noticed that they put scallions in it. I walked up to the pass to notify the expediters and they couldn't have cared less.  I asked them to please remake it and he said he's be right over.  It was 10 minutes before he came to my table and asked what the problem was.  By then, my kids were already done with their meal.  It was almost 20 minutes before he brought me back my food, with no apologies, no customer service at all. When I asked for a to go box since my entire family was done, he acted bothered and irritated as if I should have just ordered it that way in the first place. After all of that, when I got home it was gross. They not only held the scallions (as originally ordered!) but they also held the flavor.  None whatsoever on this expectedly spicy dish. My baby could have eaten it. I won't be returning to this location, for SURE!",

The sweet sauce in the \"General Chi\" style (whatever that is) was entirely too sweet to pass for anything. The beef was very tough and completely overcooked. The Orange chicken was the only mildly redeeming dish because I could eat more than a few bites without being overwhelmed with salt or sugar.

It took twenty minutes for three items - a Mongolian beef bowl, a sesame chicken bowl and and an order of spring rolls - to go. The chicken tasted like it was pre-cooked then rolled in flour and sauce poured on it. The uncooked flour taste was awful. The spring rolls were so greasy that I had to set them on a paper towel to absorb all the grease. All of the food was lukewarm.  While I waited for my food I observed an employee (girl with pony tail) drop a sauce dish on the ground and just leave it for someone else to pick up. The ladies restroom was filthy. The ordering kiosks were covered in fingerprints and grim, the menu windows by the register were covered in fingerprints and grim - so much that they were unreadable. Disgusting place and I know now why I stopped going there. I will just go to Panda Express across the street - the food is hot, cooked properly, and the bathrooms are clean!

They said 10 minutes placed my order and went next door to get the better half's dinner.  I came back a few minutes a later and the food was ready.   The order was correct too.    I get home and start to eat it and the chicken just did not taste right.  I tired a couple of smaller pieces.  I ended up taking all of the chicken out of the lo mein and eating the veggies and noodles.  The chicken tasted like maybe it was cooked sitting than reheated.  The spring rolls were good too.  The lo mein minus the chicken was good.  Just not sure what to expect with this place anymore.  Looking at the latest reviews.  I think it is time to move on now.",

    "text": "My wife, her brother and I ate here last night. There was a young man who took our order and clearly he didn't know what he was doing. I ordered a small Kung Pow chicken with fried rice without snap peas or carrots. My wife wanted to order a small shrimp fried rice and he told her they were out of shrimp. She decided to get a small plain fried rice instead and he had to ask another employee how to do that. We paid for our meal and found a table.  Her brother went to the take-out register and placed his order with a different employee and joined us at our table. She asked him what he ordered and he said steak and shrimp noodles and we told him that they said they didn't have any shrimp.  We had to wait quite a while before our food came and when it did, it wasn't right. My order has snap peas, which were easily removed but my wife's order was a large instead of a small and we checked the receipt and she was charged for a large. When her brother got his dish, it had shrimp in it. I wanted to speak to the manager but they didn't want me to make a fuss and we were in a hurry to leave. She ended up leaving most of her rice.  To be honest the food wasn't particularly good, especially compared to the locations in Glendale and Chandler that I've been to. I don't think I'll be going to this location again. There is a Panda Express nearby and I should have gone there instead.",

One of the girls seems to be confused to see us at the table for long and re-asks my name. She scrambled through some to go bags and hands us our food.  We get home only to find that the ahi tuna salad had no dressing and my cauli power bowl was missing the steak I had added to it. I look at my receipt and i was charged for extra shrimp... and I didn't even have the shrimp!  Im just disappointed that there is always an issue on ordering food here.",

It's a Saturday night at 6PM and I'm sure for reasons beyond anyone's control, there was 1 amazing cook and 1 poor kid who was taking orders, taking care of the dining room, and handling to-go's. I watched 5 customers that were standing in line waiting to order, turn around angry and leave. Our 2 entree's took 45 minutes and both were wrong. I'm guessing it's not that poor kids fault that he is the only worker tonight, but he has to take the brunt of all those angry customers. It also really sucks to pay $25 for dinner that's the wrong order and not want to wait ANOTHER 45 minutes to have them correct it. Very disappointed, and we usually eat here at least twice a week. I hope this was an isolated incident, but with all of the other reviews, it doesn't seem to be the case.",

About this PARTICULAR Pei Wei. They closed down for a while because Sheriff Joe decided that there were too many illegals working here.I came one day for lunch and BAM! Gone. It took them more than a month to get open again, which I suppose means finding non-illegals who can use a wok and a cash register.  I say: bring back the illegals.  At the new, All-American Pei Wei, the girl running the register seemed non-plussed to be receiving cash. She stared at it for quite a while, and then commenced to guess how much money she should give us in return. She got it right on the third try. Yay, Arizona schools!  As for the meal. Apparently, legal Amurricans don't get kung pao, because mine was like a salt lick. Now, I loves me some salt, but seriously. Two deer came by my table and started licking my plate.  I was like: get, deer! Get!.   It's sad, because this is the closest Pei Wei to where we live, and I like close. But the one down in Chandler near Priest and the I-10 is about a million times better at this point. Also, they have a computerized soda machine, which sweetens the deal. Did you know they have like eight varieties of Fanta? Me neither.",

We also have a bunch of gift cards to pf changs, which neither of us really likes so much, so we used one here. So we ordered online, which is a neat feature. I like how when you order online it allows you to pick and choose what ingredients you don't want and extras you might want. So anyway, when the BF got to the restaurant he paid and then was told it would just be a minute. He waited ten minutes and then asked how long it would be. The person working there said that our food was sitting on the counter, they were just waiting for the soup. So that was pretty bad, all the food was just sitting out for 15 minutes, the BF asked for them to remake the food and was given attitude. Eventually, they did remake the food. If they knew they didn't have soup, why would they box up all the rest of the food? It doesn't make sense.   As for the taste of the food, it was mediocre. We got a couple potstickers, wonton soup, orange chicken, and dandan noodles. The potstickers are weird, less noodle, more like fried bread around the meat. Not so good. The wonton soup was pretty good, definitely the best thing we ordered. The orange chicken was alright and so were the dandan noodles. Everything was really salty... the pf chang way I guess. SO I would have to say that if i was going to eat pf changs, this is a nice, cheaper option, and the food is close to the same.",

I was impressed by the size of the salad as well as the nice amount of chicken in it. The greens were fresh and crisp. I loved the crispy wontons on top!

Next time I order, I'll be sure to ask for less dressing or see if I can dress it myself.   Clean restaurant. Friendly and efficient ordering process.   Second time I've been there in less than a week.  Nom nom!",

On a recent trip, I ordered their sweet potato fries and they were the best fast food sweet potato fries to date and came with a tangy dipping sauce.     The ambiance at each location I have visited is relaxed and upscale, with dark tones and furnishings.  But it's the food that I come back for.  Their large, inexpensive portions will make you a fan.  The lettuce wraps are on par with those of PF Chang's and their spring rolls and crab wantons are slightly above average.  It's their entrees and salads that are standouts.  Their Pad Thai Chicken or Shrimp meals are flavorful and just as tasty reheated because you'll probably take half of it home.  If you're a lettuce head, the Spicy Chicken Salad is fantastic (it's my second favorite salad next to the Ruby Trout Salad at Z Tejas) and you can kick up the heat meter by adding the chili sauce and hot mustard.  I live by another excellent Asian Diner, Tott's, but I find it hard to decide which of these 2 great places to eat at when I want great food fast.  **Tip**  Sign up for their email club and become a fan on Facebook.  They send out discount coupons periodically.",

It was neither hot nor sour.  I also ordered the (not)  dynamite chicken extra spicy.  It was not spicy at all and as a matter of fact had very little flavor.

I was pretty hungry when I walked in. I was thinking ... It has been a while since I've been to Pei Wei. Let's see what has changed.   Apparently they change from bad to worse. I ordered a beef dish with dynamite flavor. It \"looks\" good until I took a bite in my mouth. The beef was fried so much that there was hardly any meat in it. I felt like I was chewing on rubber. The flavor is so soar that I could hardly bite into it. You wouldnt think they could mess up the white rice right? Wrong. It was dry and cold.   I couldn't believe what I just ate. Yelpers...if you want authentic Chinese food, please please go somewhere else. That isn't Chinese food...",

    "text": "Pei Wei what's going on???? Your food and quality is starting to really slide and become inconsistent. We eat at a Pei Wei at least once a week and this location is closest, but the quality of the food is starting to become extremely poor. Tonight my husband called in an order, a kids honey shrimp, a kids teriyaki, pad thai no vegs and a pei wei spicey...order to be ready at 7pm. He get's there and they are so busy he had to wait 20 minutes longer. The tea and the refill teas were empty, the beverage machines were sticky and not clean and the it was just dirty in general. Finally he gets the food, brings it home (5 minute drive) and it's all COLD!!! My noodles in the pad thai were one huge big cold chewy clump...bleck!!! How can that be if he is waiting for it and they handed it to him immediately when ready??? Something does not add up. He took it all back ... :( Pei Wei I am disappointed. This is not the first time this has happened, but we keep giving you a shot...maybe this time it will be right. Well after tonight we have decided to just give P.F. Chang's to go a try.   Some additional things you might want to think about, When I sit in your booths and look down and can see the crumbs and crud in between the slats of the wood, I want to puke. Maybe get some compressed air and blow that out. The soda machines are always low on ice and dirty ... I will not drink from them, the stainless steel containers that hold the straws and such ... dirty!!! It makes me question how clean the utensil is I am going to use. Garbage on the floor, dirty tables and dirty doors and windows. Finally, when you are passing to-go order over to the person who is packing them up, they should not pass through the cashier area -- YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WINDOW PASS THROUGH FOR THIS -- other costumers are standing there and looking and leaning over OPEN CONTAINERS of food and it is gross! Whose to say they didn't sneeze or cough in the direction of this food that is sitting OPEN on the cashier counter.   Get it together Pei Wei ... we have loved you for a long time, but YOU ARE SLIPPING BIG TIME!!! TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR FOOD AND RESTAURANT ... because over the past several months it does not appear that way.",

Also found what appeared to be some facial hair in our chicken lettuce wraps as did my manager in his entree. Aside from all that, the food seemed subpar compared to the many other Pei Wei locations I have visited.   Tossed the food and didn't even bother to call and complain.

I opted to leave them packed and just take home with the entire meal.  Manager was quick to remedy the situation by breezing by and dropping off a couple of appetizers cards to apologize for the mishap.  He really was apologetic and it was obvious he had the best intentions. They also offered a comp'd Lettuce Wraps for us to dine on while they finished our order but since that was my husbands meal I declined the generous offer and said no thank you. Mgr did tell me our appetizer was redone and offered them to us again but I figured that since our meal was done I should just take it home so the family gets fed.   Was super delighted to get home and learn my husbands chicken portion of his ck wraps was not what it was supposed to be. Ck chunks, bits of corn, and I don't know what else.

My boyfriend got the chicken fried rice and half of the rice was still white meaning they did not mix the soy sauce through out. All of the vegetables were raw and there was little to no flavor. Needless to say it will be a very long time before we try eating at Pei Wei again.",

    "text": "Hit or miss depending on what you order and who's working. Classics like Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken are always safe, but I'm usually disappointed when I try something new here. Stay away from the wonton soup - no veggies, just salty broth and wontons. Recently I tried the Thai style lettuce wraps and was not impressed. It was way too spicy for me, and lacked any real flavor other than being hot.   The woman at the counter was friendly and helpful, but when I asked an employee clearing tables for a fork, she told me to get one from the drink station. When I replied that there were no forks, she told me they were washing them all. What kind of restaurant runs out of forks on Friday at 130pm? There were two sets of plastic silverware at the drink station, but we needed three. Spoke with the same employee regarding the plastic forks, and she looked miserable dealing with my request, but went to get us another plastic fork. I'm sorry, two plastic forks doesn't cut it when there are three at a table.  Not that big of a deal, but my dad's fortune cookie didn't have a fortune. I guess he wasn't too lucky that day.",

Once again I ordered online and picked up my order to go.  The woman who waited on me this time was very nice and when I arrived my order wasn't ready yet so she asked me if I would like a water or drink.  I said yes to the drink and handed her my card to pay for it.  She said oh no, it's on me.  I thought that was a very nice touch since I needed to wait for my food to be finished.  I'm so happy with this experience considering how bad of a first impression I had with this place.  I ordered the veggie fried rice in the small size and the portion was still really big.  The food was delicious.",

    "text": "Food was good, came out warm and tasty. But after ordering, my grandparents and I went to find a place to sit and there were 3 empty tables with plates still on them, that hadn't been wiped down or picked up and no one was in a hurry to do so. The drink area was disgusting and looked like it hadn't been cleaned for days. The soda machines were covered in soda. Just a simple wipe down that'd take 10 minutes or less would have solved the issue. We had to ask them to refill the silverware. The employees were very nice but disorganized. I hope y'all look at this review and take notes to improve on because I'm new to town and I love Pei Wei and my family owns a business up the road from this location so I'd like to come here for lunch occasionally. You have 2 weeks, I'll be back for a visit and if things improve I'll write a fabulous review!",

I got in my car and then decided to go back in. I told him I knew I did and he tried to swipe and run the card manually. It still came back to zero. I called the number on the card. They fixed it. She talked to the cashier and handled it.  It would have been nice if he tried to help more.   2nd visit. The wait was longer than the 1st. Some how they mixed up my order. Eh (Update) my taste buds enjoyed but my stomach - not so much.. Could just be me though. 1st visit  Lo-mein /small= very tasty. Better after adding the spy sauce. The chicken is perfect. Veggies are fine. Portion is good  Potstickers = tasty but a $1 per potsticker is a bit much for their size.   Service = not a single issue. Very fast. Went in at noon. Friendly staff.   Would go again - not really. Maybe if friends were going.",

However, this time we left feeling very disappointed. My brother got a noodle dish that was subpar but passable. It was my chicken that made us want to leave and never come back. It was sweet and sour chicken with rice. The chicken was dry, the rice was even more so which we didn't know was possible. The ratio of meat to rice was also ridiculous for the price, barely any meat on the dish. Don't know if we will be coming back for awhile.",

    "text": "I have been a loyal Pei Wei customer for at least half a decade now. Every Pei Wei that I have visited before has been amazing and I have had no issues. For some reason, this one falls so short on customer service that it just drove me away from the chain completely. I had a similar issue as one of the previous reviewers with a coupon of Pei Wei's not being honored by their restaurant or not applying to the order. However, it wasn't just that part that put me off...it was the attitude of the workers and the manager in general. I placed an order online and came in when there was pretty much no one else in the restaurant. When I came up to the register to get my food, I was treated as if I was a nuisance or that I was interrupting the \"oh so busy\" manager - who, might I add, was dicking around on his phone at the time. I mentioned that I had a coupon and the manager just said \"uh huh..\" in a very annoyed tone and basically grabbed my phone out of my hands to scan it. He never asked me for my phone number so that I could get Wei Rewards points from the order either. I was honestly too afraid to ask because I didn't want to deal with anymore of his piss-poor attitude. If this Pei Wei did a serious overhaul and put the manager in some basic customer service courses or canned him altogether, this place might have a chance again from me. As of right now, I'm NEVER dining at Pei Wei again.",
