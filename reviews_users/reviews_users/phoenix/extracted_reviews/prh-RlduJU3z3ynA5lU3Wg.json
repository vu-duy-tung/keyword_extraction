Eating on campus can be nuisance because of lack of parking. They have a ton of parking in the back which you can access through the alley.  I would like to offer some constructive feedback.  I wanted to get a smoothie to finish off my dinner but their menu offers fresh squeezed juices and protein shakes with some great ingredients but no smoothies. It seems like you have all the ingredients for a great smoothie bar.  I got the beef option; the  tri-tip. It is a good piece of meat but it needs to be cut properly to get optimal tenderness and quality.  Teach the kitchen how to handle this meat properly and you'll be amazed .  Great job though. I love supporting quality locally run businesses!",

The other bowls were good. I liked the teriyaki better than the Thai bowl. The PB and J shake wasn't as good as I remember, and they forgot it with our order and we had to ask for it and get it later. No big deal. Great service and prompt food delivery.

It took almost 30 minutes for me and my friend to get our food, which is ironic because we saw people who walked in well after we took our order got their food before us, and my order was LITTERALLY cold raw veggies with cold hummus, no cooking required. And my friend had to actually go in and ask where his food was.  I asked the server if I could get some srirracha sauce and she said \"yeah it's over there for you\". But the receipt asked me if I wanted to leave a tip?  It tasted average, I would have made it at home better, quicker, and cheaper.   It was just a long unsatisfying experience for the most part. Just and average tasting cookie cutter semi expensive healthy eating hipster place. The 2 stars was because it was a nice day out.",

And because it was a hot summer day in Arizona, I also ordered Pitaya Bowl and the Chia Seed pudding.   The bowls smelled and looked amazing when I got them, but both were disappointing. The sauce for the steak bowl was overpowering while I wish I had more of the green curry sauce for the tofu bowl. Luckily both the Pitaya Bowl and Chia Seed pudding were delicious.

After placing my order for a salad in a wrap and a lemonade, I waited to see if I would get my drink immediately and as I was about to ask the young woman working the cash register, she loudly yelled \"Next!\" and no longer acknowledged me. I ordered a salad in a wrap and it came as a salad in a bowl. No big deal and I wasn't rude about it, but when I told the girl who brought it that it would be great if they could wrap it up, I could feel the wind from her eye roll. I waited 20 minutes for my drink that never came and had go go get it myself. Then as I was eating I found a pretty big bone in the chicken and kale salad so that was unpleasant. Overall the staff was younger and definitely not focused on customer service and creating a welcoming atmosphere.",

I ordered a Green Glory and they came out brown and purple rather than green and yellow. I was blown away when I asked the employee why it looked like that and she said, \"it always looks like that.\" I am speechless! I had one yesterday from chopshop and it was GREEN, why call it the Green Glory if it is going to come out brown and purple? call it the Brown Disappointment. ****** LOOK AT THE PHOTOS AND LOOK AT MY GREEN GLORY COMPARED TO SOMEONE ELSES! Also, I ordered THREE parfaits. It took three employees to make them, they under filled all parfaits, it took 30-40 minutes for them to finish, they wanted to know if I could take them without lids because they don't have any that fit, AND the presentation was TERRIBLE. If I had pictures of the exact same products from the ChopShop in Chandler to show the difference, I would, it is unbelievable!  Talked to the manager and she is incredibly understanding and I really appreciated her.",

I got the Sunrise Wrap and it was bigger than what I was expecting. I loved the mixture of the egg whites with the tomato and the cheese, although I felt like the sweet potato was overwhelming and too much in the wrap. I still ate all of it! My friend got the Acai Bowl and I tried a bite of it and that will be the next item I get when I go back to the Original ChopShop. The dining experience is very comfortable and it is easy to have a conversation with the person next to you. I'm excited to go back soon!!",

The only time it's taken a bit longer to get food is at the old town location.",

Everything is so healthy.  This place is a little $$ however I would have to definitely agree that it is reflective of the quality and type of ingredients you are getting. My lunch was about 10$ and was a good portion for myself. So looking forward to trying more of their menu next time!",

First off the whole atmosphere is super trendy & adorable. They have an outdoor life size chest table and a very cute outdoor seating area.   Even better though, the food. I opted for the tri top protein bowl with brown rice ($11). The flavors were great and the sauce wasn't too over bearing. So worth the higher price point! The portion size is pretty decent too. I ended up with some leftovers. They also have great seasonable teas too! I tried the very berry tea, very refreshing!   I just wish this place was at home in Vegas too. I'll definitely be craving it again soon!",

It quickly filled up with runners waiting for the marathon to start, and they were definitely short-staffed because I don't think they expected the marathon to cause a rush. Anyway, I think they did a fairly good job with just two (and then a third person was called in) staffers and lines out the door especially with customers complaining about waiting 10 minutes for coffee when there was clearly a giant rush and only two people working!  The place is small inside but really cute. There's a giant chess board outside with patio seating and string lights. They have a wide assortment of microbrewed sodas and health drinks. I ordered an open-face sandwich which was a giant mound of arugula, avocado, two basted eggs, ham (or turkey or something) on toast. It was way bigger than I expected because the whole thing was less than $7. And it was delicious. I thought about it all day in disbelief of how cheap and how good and how big it was. This open-faced sandwich could've gone for $13, and I'm sure people would still buy it. Just thinking about it now, a few days later, gives me a smug and satisfied feeling.",

    "text": "My best friend introduced me to this place and I love it!! There are so many healthy options and even more options to choose from if you are wanting to cater your meal to a specific diet, such as paleo-friendly.   The food tastes fresh, not frozen or pre-packaged, and are generous portions. So while the cost is sometimes a little high ($10-$12), the amount of food you are getting is well worth it. There have been times I've taken mine home and had enough for another meal.   The lemonades and juices are also delicious!   I love the outdoor patio as it feels like a little picnic area, quiet and quaint where you can watch the people go by. It contributes to the great community feeling often found in downtown Tempe.",

We picked the place purely based on looks and because it stood out from the gazillion other hamburger and taco joints around. I had the beet salad and green juice.  I love beets salads and this one definitely exceeded expectations. The food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing.  The vinaigrette was a nice compliment to the beets and goat cheese. My coworker had a protein bowl with sweet potato hash which had a ton of flavor.  We were both extremely happy with out selections and felt revitalized after a long day of travel. I would love to go back and would recommmend it to other travelers",

A nice red wine vinaigrette lightly tossed about. Hubby had the turkey sandwich and it was fresh as well. Bread was a bit dry but the sammy fixin's helped with that. Service is quick and there is seating indoors and out. Busy busy Sunday mid-day and I bet when school is in, this place is really hopping. Very welcome addition to the Mill Avenue/ASU area. YUM.",

There's no question Mill suffers from a college-selected lack of healthy options, and this place seems to be ideal to fill that need.  It is slightly more than I usually would like to pay for a lunch, but by no means exorbitant, and my desire to see such a business succeed outweighs my trepidation at spending 7 or 8 dollars for a salad (sizable though it is).  The only things that keep me from giving it a five star is the poor layout of the interior and exterior made navigating exceedingly awkward.  The line for the counter seemed to weave between the tables, and potential space outside was used for a giant chess board and corn hole area.  While fun, I think the space could have been set up better to serve the customers who want food, rather than play novelty chess.  That said, I am sure to be back.",

    "text": "If I can admit my own ignorance, this place is not too far from my house and I have wanted to go for some time but i assumed they had no parking. Well, my friend visiting from New Mexico for some local certification courses wanted a smoothie for breakfast so we drove over (because they open early, 7 am, even on a Saturday) and lo and behold, they not only have parking but a boccie ball court that you can play on when the weather is nice, and the decor and set up is quite nice - sort of an east coast theme that was clean and sets one at ease.   As I was off to my monthly beer brewing session (white IPA today) and my friend was going to her training course, we got protein smoothies and breakfast burritos to go. I had the one with peanut butter, chocolate, and a shot of espresso (just ask), and it was wonderful, refreshing, and it does indeed wake one up. The to-go box is well fashioned and they have a house made salsa (which I wish was hotter, I'll have to ask next time). I had the veggie breakfast burrito and for some reason it was a bit on the sweet side for me so I didn't like it as much as the smoothie (which I'm sure I'll get again, and again, and again).   All I can say, is that I'm happy to have a place to close that serves healthy, organic foods and after trying a few more dishes, this might go up to five starts. All I know is that I will definitely check it out again and it will probably be my go-to place for an early Saturday morning breakfast before starting my weekend activity list.   Oh, did I mention they also have local craft brew on tap? A definite plus in my book so if nothing else, stop by, have a cold one and enjoy the vibe, it's a good one! :-)",

    "text": "I LOVE this place! I was so glad to hear they were putting one in right off ASU's campus, because the food in, and around campus isn't the most healthy. Although the place can get busy, the only time you have to wait is in the line, because they really are quick with bringing food out to you and not to mention the staff is so nice and helpful when your a little lost on what to get.   Mainly what I order here are the protein plates and they are SO good, my mouth is watering thinking about the chicken, beef and tofu (I'm unsure about the shrimp because I've never tried it, but lets be honest, its probably freaking amazing). Each one of those bowls have the best flavors and they are huge portions with lots of  yummy stuff in it (so you don't end up with all the grain at the end, you end up in bliss with veggies and protein of choice)!!! It's great because you pay for what you get and you can bring home the leftovers! The pressed juices are really killer too! I haven't tried one I didn't like yet, which is crazy because if you drink pressed juices, often times they are so tart and overpowering for your taste buds, but these... these are too good. My personal favorites are the Kale Cleanse and Cold Buster - don't be scared of the ginger!!   In conclusion, beware!! If you go here once you will have to come back as often as you can! I have yet to get sick of getting the same things every time!! They also sell stevia sweetened chocolate that you will buy and eat the whole thing by yourself and share none of it.",

He didn't even look for it. I don't know what his deal was but he acted as if my presence bothered him or I could wait for him as he looked around at the rest of the staff that was standing behind the counter. He was kind to t guy in front of me (there really wasn't anyone else in there as they were busy at 10:45am on Sat) so it must be my gender or ethnicity.

I just had to throw it away and now may have an aversion to undercooked sweet potatoes.  I guess I expected more for paying $11 for the bowl. Maybe my opinion would've changed if I opted for the rice, but I didn't want to pay the extra $1 for rice.  You add the parking situation to the experience, I thought it wasn't worth driving through ASU traffic/busyness.  I actually was hungry for the Chuck Box next door when I smelled their food.  I took one of their almond butter brownies home to make up for the meal--sadly, it didn't.  I think I may go out and get a brownie box mix to make brownies that I will enjoy.  And to top it off, they were 20 minutes in getting my order to me while my friend was already halfway done with her sandwich.  The workers were nice enough, but I don't think I'll come back to this place.  I've found better alternatives in LGO and Flower Child.",

    "text": "Wanted to try this location as I work closer to the Tempe location than the Scottsdale location. When we got there it was quite busy but they moved thru the line pretty quickly. My girlfriend and I each ordered and found a table outside to wait for our food.  She ordred the tuna salad w/lemonade and I had the beet salad w/ice tea. After about 5 minutes her sandwich came out and 15 minutes later my salad came out. She was almost finished with her food by the time my salad came out. I also noticed the two girls that shared a picnic table outside with us this was their same problem as well. I wasn't too happy that there was such a drastic time difference in the ticket times for getting our lunch. While the salad was good and I will get again I feel they need to work on getting the food out together so people can actually eat together.",

    "text": "I am sure this place has great food, and it has kind of a cool, young vibe. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu, so I asked the woman taking my order what sandwiches were the most popular. She recommended two, and I picked the one that sounded better to me. Some sort of club sandwich, not a far cry from a sandwich I would typically order, so I knew I would like this type of meal.  When the food came, the sandwich was extremely disappointing. The bread was so DRY. Not fresh or springy or anything good, it was dry and crumbly. I took about three bites, discovered that the rest of the ingredients followed suit with being disappointing.   So, I brought it back up to the counter, and told the same woman who had taken my order that I did not like the food, that it was dry, and that I wanted to take it back. She was sweet and smart and called over another woman, Im guessing a supervisor or a manager, and explained the situation. This supervisor woman clarified that I \"just didn't like it\" and told me that they would not be replacing my meal with something else. I said fine and just asked for a refund, which she unhappily gave me.  The thing that irks me is that they weren't willing to give me something else. So, I leave this place hungry and with a bad food experience. What incentive does this give me to go back? From the experience I had, I didn't like the food or the customer service. Not to mention, the sandwich alone cost 8 bucks. If I can go to Sprouts and get a bomb ass sandwich for $3.50, I want an 8 dollar sandwich to blow my socks off, not be a total disappointment.",

Both were extremely delicious and tasty.  The wrap was so filling, I couldn't finish it all.    The reason why I'm giving four stars is purely based on price.  For two items that I ordered it came to $20.  While I'm fine paying that for fresh food, eating here often at $20 a pop is not something I can manage. But it is certainly a nice treat!  I definitely recommend ChopShop if you are looking for fresh/organic and delicious food.",

They apologized about what happened but didn't really do anything else. The bowl was pretty good but some of the toppings were soggy and didn't taste fresh like you want with an acai bowl.

After a brief wait to order inside, my friends and I sat outside on their spacious patio and soaked in the sun while enjoying our dishes. I opted for the BBQ Chicken salad, a delectable combination of house greens, chicken, cheddar, corn, green onion, tomato, corn nuts, cilantro, and a ranch dressing. It was all very tasty, although I wish it was a larger serving considering I still could have eaten more and it was the most expensive salad on the menu. But combined with one of their flavored iced teas and the thought that I need to diet, it worked out well.   The patio area is especially nice for just lounging when the weather isn't too horrifically hot. There are shared areas and big group tables in the sun.",

I could probably eat here for every meal and be satisfied.   The selections are your standard upscale health food joint: smoothies, salads, rice bowls, sandwiches, and teas. They've also got to go options such as bars and other small treats.   The line gets pretty long during the lunch rush so keep that in mind. Otherwise it is consistently busy but not packed. You may also see plenty of plastic Scottsdale people, but that comes with both the territory and the genre of cuisine.   Honestly, I love this place's ambience, menu, and taste. The service is usually stellar too. My only grievance is that everything is over priced. I get that it's all organic and whatever, but it is the same price as a sit-down meal, which feels kind of wrong.",

The second time the veggies didn't seem steamed/cooked long enough as they were super crunchy it just took away from the bowl. The Brussels sprouts tasted lemony and were awful. I was certain to ask for extra sauce this time but once again, no silverware when the food was delivered. The potions were great, plenty good mix of avocado, rice, chicken and veggies but so far no consistency in taste.",

You also can't go wrong with the hash and forbidden rice; I usually do a moisture of both when I'm doing a hot bowl.

    "text": "Chop Shop is a good healthy alternative to the rows of burgers along Mill and in the adjacent downtown area, but I couldn't help but notice that it's a bit pricey and that the sandwiches just don't land for me.  The tri-tip/mushroom/onion mix was tasty and well-prepared, but the sandwich appears to have been designed by someone who has never eaten a sandwich before. It's close to 5 or 6 inches in diameter, on this circular whole wheat psuedo-bun. The bun is tasty enough, but when they load the sandwich with a light layer of meat and veggies, the sandwich collapses in on itself like a dying star.  I ended up knife & forking it, but it was tasty at the very least. Unfortunately, there was also about an inch thick layer of arugula, which was a bit much, but that was relatively easily remedied.   I think the reason we're sitting down at 3 stars for now is because my total tab out the door with a sandwich, chips, and an iced tea was just about $15. That's a bit steep for fast-casual in my opinion, and it's not helped by House of Tricks having completely amazing, blow-you-away (though not fast or as casual) meals for about the same price for lunch.  They also advertised the bowls as including Forbidden Rice, but the rice that came out was brown rice instead. Maybe they were out or there was some confusion; that wasn't my dish so I'm not sure on that count.  I think I'll give them another shot and order a protein plate for myself, if they're able to do forbidden rice. It'd make a decent place to grab a bunch of take out for the office, and it's a much much healthier alternative to the other stuff we eat every week.   The staff was friendly, the iced tea was good, and the food was pretty tasty all said and done.",

My juice came fairly quickly, even though they had a line across their tiny dining room. For five dollars the portion was totally generous, and the juice itself was very fresh and tasted absolutely delicious. I was extremely impressed, and I couldn't wait to come back.  Today was my second visit, however I was much less thrilled with my experience this time. I decided to try one of their iced lattes, and I was expecting something of the same quality as the juice I had prior. The girl who took my order seemed totally aloof, I asked her how her day was going and the interaction was just awkward. After ordering my latte she did not ask me what kind of milk I wanted, and I didn't think to mention it. My latte came quickly, however, I'm certain they used skim milk or something else sacrilegious in my drink. It was horrible. Absolutely horrible.  I still have faith in Chopshop, although next time I am definitely not ordering a milk based coffee drink from them. Their location is prime and their patio is perfect. Wi-Fi is totally reliable. I would absolutely recommend you stop by.",

    "text": "I'm sitting here looking at my order. To start this, let me prerequisite my review by saying that this is the third time I've decided to give the Tempe Chop Shop \"one last try\". The last time I was here I waited close to an hour for my order and witnessed some of the worst health code violations I have ever seen. The guy boxing up my salad had just taken out the trash, swept and mopped without washing his hands once. Immediately after that he grabbed the lid to my salad bowl and covered it then took my tortilla and wrapped it in in parchment paper without washing his hands or wearing gloves.  Tonight I received a salad that didn't match anything listed on the menu. I ordered a Danish and what I received was a small handful of lettuce drenched in dressing. Topping this sad excuse of a salad was a single apple slice, several pieces of corn, and a glob of goat cheese. It was disgusting to say the least. My side include hummus and a tortilla. The hummus was chunky and not fully mashed and the tortilla was burned. To top this off, the tortilla wasn't fully wrapped and was tossed on the table upside down exposing at least half of it to an unclean table outside.  I will never come back here.  I will say that the Scottsdale location is always on top of their game and I will make the long drive there if I want Chop Shop. What's perplexing to me is how the Scottsdale location is always busier than the Tempe location, yet the wait time is usually a fraction of Tempe's and the food is always made well. I wish I could have the $30 back on terrible food from the Tempe Chop Shop.  P.S This is my first negative review, I rarely complain about businesses.",

We waited about 15 minutes for our food, but passed the time with the free magazines they have to read. The tofu bowl was excellent; the teriyaki sauce had a subtle spiciness and I really enjoyed the forbidden rice and roasted vegetables. Large portions, too! Boyfriend liked his chicken prosciutto sandwich (\"I'm full but I can't stop eating, it's too good\").  As a side note, they were having problems with the music. It sounded like a CD was skipping? Lasted the duration of our lunch. I would rather have no music than intermittent music.  We're excited to come back to try breakfast.

Second time I went I ordered a teriyaki tofu protein bowl with sweet potato hash. Sweet potato hash is a must get its delicious and added majority of the flavor. Most of the tofu wasn't rubbery and actually tasted good but the bowl still needed more flavor.   Normally the tofu protein bowl comes with a curry sauce but I switched mine to teriyaki because I'm not a curry fan and the girl at the counter charged me for a teriyaki chicken bowl and substituted the chicken for tofu, totaling to $10.80 when a tofu bowl is only $7 so I had to get a refund which is fine but the girl nor the manager was apologetic. I understand mistakes happen but make up for them with sincere positive attitude don't avoid eye contact and one word me.   All in all they have healthy options that taste good and I'll continue coming back but not a favorite.",

The veggies were uncooked which I thought was weird when I ate it but still did eat it. The chicken didn't taste bad. But I don't know what happened my stomach started rumbling when I got to work and I barfed everything I ate. It still hurts!! What was in your food Chop Shop? I have never gotten sick from any food from a \"healthy\" place before! Have to just avoid this place",

You will find a very good kids menu at the counter and this place is definitely munchkin friendly.

It's also expensive but the typical price for healthy food. I usually get a protein bowl and a small juice and it's like $20. The food is kind of bland as well and my rice is usually hard and crunchy in my protein bowl. If I ever order an acai bowl they always mess up my order and their smoothies aren't very flavorful. I love their juices though. I want to love this place but it's just not there yet.",

I am never patient to wait in line so I didn't go so here was my chance on a Friday around 4pm to go to the Tempe location. There was probably no wait this time and I was right. We took advantage of happy hour sangrias for $5. It was good, but the portion was a little light.   I ordered the shrimp protein bowl with forbidden rice and fiance ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with forbidden rice. Both were good, healthy, and filling. I also ordered the almond butter brownies. That was a total \"fail\". I can make better paleo brownies...  The bill = 2 sangrias, 2 protein bowls, 1 brownie = $36.21 + $2 parking fee.  Overall, I think ChopShop is a tad bit overpriced and a little overrated.....and I'm a little over it.",

I was wondering if we'd even be able to find a seat once we placed our order.   The mix of professionals and ASU students that made up the clientel of this place gave it the trendy feel and i was excited to try the food.  After waiting 20 minutes to order we miraculously found a table and our food came shortly after  Their menu ranges from salads, wraps, sandwiches and protein bowls so the selection is good. I went with th protein bowl with brown rice and shrimp. It was good but could have used more flavor.  They have an option to get forbidden rice but there is really no explanation saying what it is so i wasnt inclined to try it.  All in all it was a good spot for lunch and i will be back. Good place to eat healthy",

Instead of remaking it, they picked out the wrong meat (chicken) and threw some of the correct meat (steak) on top. Anyone who works in this industry knows that is a HUGE no-no.  The second time: I ordered the parfait and they made me a smoothie.. It was good but it wasn't what I ordered. The third: I got some type of sandwich that was just awful. It had sweet potatoes in it that were not cooked at all. Crunchy and totally unappetizing.   Three strikes and you're out, I'm not going back to this place.

Seeing as they take a lifetime to do even this I stood by the counter where they call the drinks hoping that might put a pep in their step for getting me my food quicker. As I stood there I watched the woman make it, and I watched her dump about 3 tablespoons of chocolate syrup into my drink.  Now, if you want chocolate syrup and are told you are ordering it, by all means fine...but of you're under the impression you're receiving chocolate protein powder in your drink you may be slightly upset. If I wanted chocolate syrup I'd go to an ice cream shop.  I asked her where on the menu it said that was in my drink and her reply was \"well it doesn't\". I know. She didn't seem how to respond, I told her I wasn't blaming her just that she should pass along to someone higher up that that may (does) make customers unhappy and they should put it on the menu (doubtful).  It's always disappointing when you're under the impression you're eating healthy and you're not. Boo.  I'll go back for other things (carefully) but not the muscle malt one of whatever it's called.",

But I've several bad experiences here and have had to leave TWICE because the food took so long that I had to go to work.  And I've arrived with ample time.   The first time I came in an hour before I had to be at a work meeting and ordered some breakfast.  The Open Faced breakfast sandwich is great and I don't normally mind waiting the average 20 minutes to get my food.  But after sitting patiently on the patio for over 40 minute and my food didn't arrive I had to go inside.  I never got an answer as to what went wrong, but regardless my food wasn't even started being made and so I demanded my money back and left hungry.  The manager apologized and told me to ask for him next time and he would help me out.  I don't want hand outs, I just want my food when I order it.  But I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in restaurants and I know how things go.   Several times after this incident (I end up here at least twice a week some times) I have had to wait unreasonable amounts of time to get food. I've ended up having to take it to go and eat at work a few times because it took so long.   I might understand this when it's busy, but these are times when it's slow.  I've learned to not even try eating there if I have less than an hour to spend during lunch.  This morning was probably the final straw for me though. I went in with 20 minutes until I had to be at work.  (My work is a 3 minute walk from this place so it's extra convenient) There place was pretty empty with two people ordering and two people in front of my in line.  After waiting about 5 minutes or so to get up to the register I placed my order for the Jacked up PB +J shake.  It's pretty stellar. But then I waited, and waited and waited.  I watched people who ordered after me get food and drinks.  Before I knew it, it was after 10am and I was late for work.  Looking in the kitchen I saw the cook starting what might have been my order, but I was already late by this point. I didn't even have time to ask for a refund I just left.  I'll eat the $6 (which is a little over priced anyway) as a reminder not go back to this place until they can figure out how to get food out in a timely manner.  It could just be me, but I thought 20 minutes to order a smoothie would be plenty of time.  Apparently I was wrong.  I should have gone to Starbucks.",

Clean, hip and relaxed. Very, very relaxed. So relaxed in fact that the only order taker spent the better part of 10 minutes on the first 2 in line. They must have been ordering take out for the gang back at the fraternity house. But nay.. I heard one of their totals @ $5.93! The gal taking the order seemed nice enough, pleasant and certainly relaxed as were 3 other guys working there, milling around. Not sure what milling around really means but they were definitely good at it. After the nearly 10 minute wait the line had whittled down to 8ish. Mathematically I envisioned 30-45 minutes just to place our order. Who's got that kind of time? You do the math! If I had more time I'd still find it hard to reward them with my business. Needless to say we left to patronize another of the 1000 dining choices there are in Tempe. I'm sure my experience was an anomaly. So many good reviews from happy patrons, I wish I could say I was one of them.   PS I thought I said this was gonna be a short review..",

Takes 40 minutes to get your food because they can't figure out the line, servers, kitchen staff, cashiers, customers, all bouncing around and running into one another.   I mean, come on? Why should it take fourty minutes to wait in a line and order a sandwich?   Better off going to somewhere else with faster service...especially if you actually like to eat during your lunch hour.",

    "text": "Stop for ChopShop!  Located by the ASU Main Campus, I've become very attached to the Original ChopShop because of it's healthy options and the use of fresh whole ingredients.  From fresh juices to protein drinks, you can get hydrated from the freshest fruits and veggies. If you're looking for more substance, you can pick from salads, wraps, superfruit bowls & parfaits and my personal favorite: the grilled protein bowls.  Nothing says \"on your mark, get set, eat\" more than the Green Curry Tofu Bowl with sweet potato hash ($7). This has been a long time trusted choice when I need a quick meal on the go. The green curry ignites the heat in the dish and the savory sweet potato hash nicely harmonizes with the spice.  One of these days, I'll need to come before noon to try their Avocado Toast. I've been on an avocado kick and will try to come here for their Rise & Shine menu because their Avocado Toast sounds like it's off the chain!  All meals are made to order and if you're in a rush, call it in to avoid the crowd. Enter the queue, order, pay and they will bring out your order by number. All of the staff have been very friendly and energetic.   This is the perfect place to meet up with friends because of the comfortable indoor and outdoor seating. A big plus about this location is their private parking lot next door.  Be healthy or get chopped!",

For $7.25, you get Acai blended with apple juice, mixed berry, banana, topped with granola, strawberry, banana, shredded coconut, agave nectar.  It was cool and delicious.  I still prefer the more concentrated acai puree, but can't seem to find any in the area.  Cold brew coffee 16oz $4 - I think it's great they had honey and agave sweetener as options.  There's a small parking lot right next to the restaurant, but you have to access it through the back alley.  There were plenty of spots left when I came on a weekday morning.  Other great options for acai bowl in the area that I tried: Berry Divine Acai Bowls (slightly more expensive) and Delicious Factory (slightly cheaper).  ....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

However, this place is my favorite place to eat in Tempe. It's a health-forward kind of eatery, not exactly low calorie, but the quality is good, and the people working there are so kind that it's a fun environment to be in and hang out. I've had basically everything - the yogurt parfaits (mint chocolate is to die for), the acai bowl, the protein bowls, the salads, and add-on shrimp to everything! I haven't had any protein shakes, but have had one of their green juices, which was wonderfully delicious and full of vegetables, just the way that I like it. I keep track of the dishes I've had on a menu in my backpack - that's how dedicated I am to this place!   They also have a cute shop with health bars and snacks that you can purchase for the go. My favorites are the RxBars that they carry - I usually buy in bulk online but here I can get one or two in case I want to have a different flavor that what I ordered online.   I love this place and would come here every day if I had the stomach space. If you're feeling some good healthy comfort food, this is the right place to go! Definitely try it if you're in Tempe!",

My call was answered quickly and I proceeded to order the Grilled Protein Bowl with chicken and sweet potato hash ($9.75 after tax) and was quoted a 20 minute pick-up time.   Walking through the enticing, but packed outdoor patio (the Yelp community was right, as per usual), I entered the small building and had to wait in line even though I was just picking up (boy was I glad I ordered ahead of time for my short and very precious lunch break). Once I reached the window, I received my meal  without any problems along with utensils and napkin to take back with me. I like the type of bowl they use, its like an eco-friendly, recycled, cardboard type bowl that makes me feel like I am doing Mother Earth a favor by eating out of, which is rad because I like to eat so now I have greater purpose.  Anyway, the food itself was delicious and I would order it again, but at nearly $10 a bowl, it can't be something I enjoy on a routine basis.",

    "text": "This place definitely has energy. The good kind of energy and ambiance that makes you literally want to go there every night, sit on their patio, enjoy their food, and ponder on your thoughts for hours. And I just deduced that from my first visit there.   Ever since I started going to ASU (about 2 years ago) I have really wanted to try this place. That means I spent 2 years of running into their Yelp page, staring wide-eyed at pictures of their yummy protein bowls, fresh salads, and delectable-looking pitaya bowls. That is, until, I finally decided to give Original ChopShop Co. a try.   Around 7:00 PM on Monday night, I called in a take-out order for their shrimp protein bowl accompanied with their forbidden rice. The user-submitted images of the shrimp protein bowl made it an easy sell for me. A bunch of large, succulently cooked shrimp drizzled in chili-lime sauce? What more could you ask for?! Anyhow, about 30 minutes later, I picked up my bowl. The place is small, and at that hour it was really starting to get packed. There was a line at the dine-in register about 6-7 people long, and all of the staff were working hard to accommodate accordingly. It was a tad bit annoying that I had to wait in the \"pick-up orders only\" line for around 10 minutes, considering I was the only person in line, but hey. I'm not going to complain because it's not like the staff were just sitting around.   I was greeted by a young gentleman who was personable and didn't seemed bothered by the rush, something that is key in a high-volume, fast-casual dining establishment. I paid for my meal, and after tax, I was just shy of $12, not including a tip. I took my bowl and went on my merry way.   When I opened the sack the bowl was in, it was a nice surprise to find that the chili lime sauce came on the side, rather than being put on top of the bowl to let the contents get soggy. I was rather disappointed, however, at the size of the actual bowl and the contents. The bowl itself was large, however the rice/shrimp/veggies/etc only took up maybe half of the volume of the bowl. Something I wasn't expecting for almost $12. There were around 10-11 shrimp inside, but don't be fooled, they were a lot smaller than the ones in most of the pictures on Yelp. Mine were a smidge larger than than the size of a quarter. Like I said, after seeing the bowl and its contents it was hard to justify the money I spent on it.   I regained some of that lost faith in Original ChopShop Co. when I took my first bite of the protein bowl. The shrimp were cooked excellently. They had just the right amount of crunch, were seasoned perfectly, and were cleaned and de-veined appropriately. The forbidden rice is a nice complement to the meal, as it has a wholesome, nutty flavor (not to mention it is chock-full of antioxidants). The veggies includied (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms) were also cooked well. They still had some crunch to them, which I like. All together, the flavors blended harmoniously. Like I said, the chili-lime sauce is what really tied it together. It was not too spicy, nor too tangy and was a perfect, and yes I mean perfect, accent for the succulently-cooked shrimp. All in all, I really loved the protein bowl.   I will always be a fan of Original ChopShop Co. so long as they keep producing bowls and salads and whatnot this delicious and this fresh. It really is getting more and more difficult to find good quality food these days. However, I won't be visiting them as often as I would like, because being a full-time college student on a part-time budget doesn't allow  much room for me to be spending in upwards of $12 on one meal item. But as far as treating myself goes, I will definitely return and try some more delicious-looking menu items.",

Remember to tip because these guys bust their ass to keep up with demand of trendy campus kids who want to be cool and eat at ChopShop!  If it's lunch time better be ready to wait.  definitely allow at least twenty minutes from entrance to exit during rush hour.  They make the wait worth it!",

I also went there recently for my birthday lunch with my coworkers. The restaurant is fairly small but they have a large front patio. It was still extremely busy but we were able to get an inside table. There was a line out the door but once we had ordered our food came out pretty quickly. The crowd seemed to be mostly ASU students so maybe I'll give it a try again now that it is summer. It is a bit far to walk in the heat but now that they have the Mill Ave trolley it is no problem.",

They are very disorganized with bringing out food at the same time. Waited an extra 20 mins to get my drink, while the rest of my party was served and other tables too.

You can At least admit it and give me another bowl with tiny shrimps, few mushrooms and big ass broccolis!!!.",

Came here this morning at 7:30 the guy at the register had change spread out all in front of him when we went to order (signaling that they were behind on opening). Ordered coffee and breakfast, was informed that they had a power issue overnight so coffee would be about 6 minutes, no biggie. 25 minutes later our food arrives and we ask if the coffee was ready to which we were told \"i didn't know you wanted coffee so i just started brewing it\"... what? The only redeeming quality was the gal said that she could brew two americanos for us so that was nice. Now the food, oh so disappointed. I ordered the egg and veggie hash, egg was cooked well but the hash was luke-warm and pretty bland, mostly potatoes and not a lot of other veggies. My husband had the breakfast sandwich and off the bat the arugula was grey and wilted. My husband ate a few bites and after we got our americanos tossed the food in the trash. Such a waste of time, money, and food.  One extra star for proving a coffee alternative.",

The first time we all got our wonderful meals but one if the orders was wrong. Usually that doesn't matter, but the guy was 100% unapologetic and didn't offer to fix it.  We gave it a second shot because goodness gracious the food rocks. But this time the same guy took our order and I very clearly pointed at something on the gluten free menu and said I wanted it with the gluten free sauce. My boyfriend got a similar dish. He brought them out, both wrong, and I ate half of one before realizing it wasnt what I ordered so I went up to the front to make sure what I was eating was in fact gluten free. Turns out it wasn't. I told him what I had ordered and he ARGUED with me! What? He told me I was wrong and didn't offer one word of apology or even sympathy. Even if the customer is wrong, you have to be polite. Especially if they have a food allergy and expressed that to you when ordering. I hate to abandon this place, but that guy was awful to us twice. Wont be back until this dude is gone.",

Very popular place for those working at and around ASU. Nice patio for outdoor seating in the cooler months. The food is good;, i've tried the beef Grilled tri-tip was a little messy ended up using a fork/knife & the Club had a good amount of turkey and bacon, not a fan of the pesto spread so i always have them leave that off. Each sandwich comes w a small side salad w dressing. They also serve breakfast which i haven't tried but heard its good. Place is great for those who like to eat healthy and are looking for an alternative to fast food, not so much for the burger and fries type.  Its a little pricey especially if you add a lemonade or one of their juices w your meal you would be paying close to $20 for lunch per person. Only rating it 3 stars for its value.",

It is picnic style tables and this makes the whole dining experience feel more relaxed. The staff who work their are always friendly and the place has a very modern feel. ChopShop offers salads, sandwiches, wraps, smoothies, fresh pressed juices, and protein bowls as their main dishes. They also have homemade teas and lemonade that are so delicious so I recommend grabbing a drink with your order! They have great options for breakfast as well such as pastries, breakfast wraps and bowls . My favorite thing on the menu is the acacia bowls. They are acacia blended fruit bowls topped with coconut, granola, and agave nectar, strawberries and bananas. They are very filling and sweet, while being healthy. In terms of pricing, most smoothies are around $6, and meals around $10-12. It is worth the price, in my opinion. College students might prefer something a little more quick and easy, but I like to stop in every so often to get a meal I feel good about eating. The reason I am giving 4 stars, is because there are only a few things on the menu that are appealing to me, and a lot that seems a little too out their for me to try. Overall, I would recommend stopping by ChopShop when in the Tempe area!",

    "text": "I've been to Chopshop a couple times in the past and have had no problems. However, I am allergic to some nuts and during my previous lunch experience I had an allergic reaction to something that was in my salad after only a couple bites. The salad that I ordered was not advertised as containing any nuts to which I am allergic. My nut allergy is not that severe (for example I can eat products that are packaged in the same facility as all other nut products, peanut oil, peanut flour etc) and have never had any problems like this in any other restaurant in the past. I broke out into hives all over my body and my throat swelled. This indicated to me that there was a large amount of nut-product (unintended) in the salad itself.   When I told the employees, they did not appear at all sympathetic or sorry and simply said that we don't guarantee a nut-free environment. While this is True of most restaurants, some level of separation must be maintained for the safety of those with severe allergies.  I can only imagine what would have happened to someone who was highly allergic to nuts--the consequences could certainly be more severe the next time around. I am posting this review just in case it can help minimize health risks to patrons in the future.",

I really liked the patio atmosphere, it was a beautiful day so we chose to sit outside, the inside layout is a bit small for my taste but I guess you could just call it cozy. The outside chair I sat in was quite uncomfortable, but it's definitely not something that would deter me from going back. The only unfortunate thing that my boyfriend and I did not enjoy was the INSANELY long line we waited in, obviously we came right during the lunch rush, which is not their fault that they are so busy, but it was frustrating that there was only one register being utilized because the other was for To-Go/Pick-Up orders only. I feel like if they could add another register it would have made a huge difference. All in all, the food was amazing and even though we waited a good thirty minutes to place our order, it was delivered to us very quickly. So I will definitely be back... I'm a Chop Shop fan now!",

It's worth the wait because I ALWAYS am greeted by a welcoming cashier with EXCELLENT customer service along with delicious food. I was ordering 2 days ago and was being helped by the nicest cashier when a manager came over and started yelling at him right in front of me. As a manager myself, that gives a horrible perception of management at Chopshop. That couldn't have waited until the customer left? Not only was the manager rude but degrading towards his employee. Never once have I received bad service from Chop Shop employees, they are nothing short of genuine and sweet, but the management needs to improve their coaching skills, especially if they want their seniored employees to stick around.",

Since being diagnosed with celiac disease it has been very hard to find restaurants that offer gluten free options and are tasty, as well. ChopShop has nailed it and has become one of my favorite spots!  Every time I have eaten there I have had nothing but great customer service and all employees are filled with knowledge when it comes to needing assistance with the menu- especially dealing with food allergies. They have plenty of alternatives including gluten free wraps for sandwiches. Their healthy menu marks each item with a \"gf\" indicating it is already gluten free, which makes it easy for me as a customer to read and find what I want. They even make fresh juices and smoothies on the spot; all that I have tried have been fantastic! I will always recommend ChopShop to my fellow friends with Celiac!",

In terms of the food, however, I thought my meal here was just mediocre. I ordered the egg and veggie hash and added chicken to it. I don't know what was going on, but my food took way too long to come out and when it did, I found it rather bland. Disappointing to think I waited about 20 minutes for it. Despite that though, I wouldn't mind coming back to try other things on the menu if I ever make it back here. I just hope the long service was just a one time thing.",

(If you don't have time to wait, order ahead.) I've heard many things about the Acai bowl here and in this hot heat, I needed a cool down. Once it was delivered to our table, I wasn't disappointed! The bananas, the strawberries, coconut and everything else in it was just perfect.   It was a bit pricey. But what can you expect of a healthy joint? I would definitely come back again to explore the rest of their menu especially one of those delicious protein bowls!",

I guess I've learned my lesson with ordering food an hour before a restaurant closes. I thought that was ok to do but I guess not. First of all, service is good and staff is friendly but OH MAN, you know that protein bowl that I raved about in my previous review about this place? I totally changed my mind. This protein bowl they gave me tonight is inedible. Soooo...the brown rice was like a bunch of gravel. Seriously..if they told me it was chicken over rocks I would've believed them.  Second, I don't eat red meat at all, like under any circumstances. I just do not enjoy it so I always only order fish or chicken dishes at restaurants. I even emphasize the word CHICKEN when I order things..anyways...my bowl was a fairly even mix of chicken and steak. I'm glad I have hawk eyes because you could've easily mistaken it for mushrooms. The vegetables were definitely the \"end of the night\" batch cause they were cold and super tough.  Anyways, I thought the teriyaki sauce they provided would at least make the bowl OK if I drowned it in the rice but dude..no.  I'm praying that I chose this place on a bad night but I will have to seriously have to think about it a lot before coming back here because THAT was unforgivable.",

    "text": "I really liked this place. I ordered the gluten-free wrap and it was fantastic! I always hesitate ordering things that specifically contain a GF product because sometimes you really can't taste the difference between that and cardboard.   I asked the cashier how they were before ordering and he told me that many non - GF people order them often too since they are so good. I think that says a lot as wheat bread is obviously better tasting and not dry.   Worth a try... especially if you're GF or vegan! Nice and healthy with a bit of tasty! Hate green things? Give it a shot!",

Good hangout place if you're coming here just to get some drinks or smoothies.   I came for the food, I got the spicy Korean steak. Just the bowl plus tax total $11.89.  On the pricey side, but expected for a hipster place.  The bowl came with cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, the steak and sesame seeds. I added on the option of brown rice. Not too impressed with the spicy steak. It tasted more like a beef stew type of steak. Definitely not spicy and no Korean influence tasted in the flavor.  Brown rice was chewy, it's the short style brown rice. Edible, but not my favorite, but you can choose a different auction instead of brown rice.",

He's a pretty healthy eater and decided to show me where he likes to eat in Tempe which is how we ended up at The Chop Shop.  Off the bat, I loved the aesthetics of the place....you get a warm, cozy, casual, chill vibe when you're here. There's seating on the inside albeit a little tight especially when there's a line out the door just to order. But there is plenty of outside seating in a garden, patio like area and it's pet friendly. I ordered the grilled protein bowl with teriyaki chicken- the bowl comes with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onions, mushroom, carrot, your choice of brown rice or sweet potato hash or for  $1 more- you can order quinoa or the \"forbidden rice\" ...should've asked what was forbidden about it  :-)  It was just what the doctor ordered- fresh, healthy, filling and just plain ol' yummy! Pair that with a fresh squeezed juice and you are bonafide healthy for the day!  I'd definitely visit next time I'm in town.",

(I will say she prefers the Chandler restaurant because every time she orders a salad at the Tempe location they forget to leave out a couple ingredients she specifically mentioned). I got a blueberry muffin and the club sandwich. The food was ok but way overpriced in my opinion. I feel like I could have made the same food at home but better and for a lot cheaper. I will still give the restaurant one more try though and try one of their breakfast dishes.",

    "text": "My favorite new find in Tempe? The Original ChopShop Co!   I don't know how this place has eluded me since it's opening in February, but I found this \"diamond in the rough\" that is Mill Ave (amongst the bars and burger joints).The restaurant was founded on the belief that you CAN eat healthy on-the-go \"without sacrificing fresh, memorable flavors or affordability\" which I may have previously doubted, but after trying ChopShop I'm a BELIEVER!   After trying a refreshing fresh pressed juice last week for the first time, I was excited to  return and check out the lunch menu. The reviews on Yelp and photos just seemed too good to be True. Could such a place really exist? After trying the lunch menu, I would say yes - it's THAT good! I had the Tofu Teriyaki Bowl ($7) and a small seasonal Lemonade ($2). My friend had the Kale Caesar with Chicken ($9) and an Arnold Palmer. Both dishes were incredibly flavorful and the drinks were refreshing. The portions were quite generous and we both had leftovers for that we could look forward to for later.   In case you're wondering what Forbidden Rice is, like I was, let me share what I learned. No, they're not being cheeky by calling it \"forbidden\" - there is such a thing. According to LotusFoods (rice distributor), Forbidden Rice provides the richest nutritional value, providing a higher level of vitamins, minerals and fiber of any bran rice, as well as a comprehensive range of amino acids, proteins, vegetable fats and essential trace elements needed by the body. Now, you know!  As others have noted, the ambiance both inside and outside of the restaurant is relaxed, comfortable, and urban chic. The patio is the perfect lunch date spot or place to work (in the late afternoon after the lunch crowd). Can't wait to return and try the breakfast menu!",

    "text": "This was my first time at ChopHouse and I will definitely be going back. It has a darling, modern, cozy vibe about it. The patio is my favorite part-- complete with globe lights, chairs, umbrellas, a fireplace, and giant chess! The inside is decorated just as well; think urban country, or shabby hipster chic. And, get this ladies and gentleman: each table has a PURSE HANGER on the side of it. Why yes, that was an incredibly nice touch, indeed. Though, I'm glad my purse wasn't particularly heavy, for fear that it would have taken the table down.  Each of the three employees we spoke with were very friendly and accommodating. One even gave me some recommendations about the menu since I hadn't been in before. Also, the men's denim shirts are a rad choice as a uniform. *thumbs up for all around styling*  Initially I ordered a small Green Glory juice-- which had kale, apple, kiwi, ginger...and something else. It was seriously so delicious that after I finished the first, I ordered a large juice to go. Of course, $10 for a 32 oz. cup of juice seemed steep, but it really was so fresh and tasty that it ended up feeling more like a meal than a beverage. So, perhaps I won't be able to come to ChopHouse everyday, but $10 for something healthy and delicious was infinitely better than the $6 I would spend on a venti sugary whatever from Starbucks. ChopHouse, you win!  I also ordered the Cheat Day Burrito (I think that was what it was called?). Eggs and avocado, with bacon and turkey with brown rice, in a wheat wrap. No tomato. YUM! The salsa that comes on the side is very flavorful too. Of course, I couldn't finish said burrito (what with all of the juice I had consumed) so I brought the leftovers home for my boyfriend, who was equally as pleased by the burrito. The juice didn't make it home.  After reading some reviews about the rushes that ChopHouse gets, I was worried that we would have to wait a long time for our food. Not the case. We arrived at the perfect time this morning, since we were the only customers inside the restaurant. Eventually, we migrated to the patio, which was also a great choice. Hello October in Arizona, right?  I can't wait to return to ChopHouse. It's inspired me to attempt juicing for myself (which may fail miserably). Thanks ChopHouse!",

    "text": "The mood here, or more specifically the mood that this place fosters is its greatest feature.  It possesses an originality and genuineness that is rare.  It's \"a small, modest, European-style restaurant\" that has a big city growing up around it, it's obviously adapting to it's circumstances though but it has avoided becoming generic.    The menu items are entirely defined by one or more of the following:  organic, fresh/local, health conscience, and unprocessed.  Their lemonade is perhaps the best I've ever had, and I've only ever had a better Tri-tip sandwich in Austin TX.  The staff are willing to customize nearly anything on the menu for you which I great for people with allergies or sensitives.  Chop Shop isn't without it's faults though which are a product of its virtues; the line to order is insufferable from 11-2, the wait time for food is consistently inconsistent, the seating is terribly uncomfortable and equally scarce, and if you're there for a beer or any drink you have no option but to wait in the unreasonably long line to get it.    Four stars is perhaps insufficient but five is quite deserved (yet).  Regardless, I'm very happy this place exists and I'm a regular.  #favoriterestaurantintempe",

Their smoothies came out after 5 min and they never got their food order. They walked in and the people \"forgot\" about their food!!! AFTER the fact that they even tipped them!  Talk about HORRIBLE service!  UPDATE- Chop Shop made it up to me by contacting me and offering a complimentary meal, which was very nice.  I highly suggest getting all locations to work on efficiency. Went to the Scottsdale location tonight to get food, and there were probably 5 people waiting. I ended up waiting 25 min for my protein bowl. A family of 6 were dining in and they waited atleast 45 min and I still got my order before them. The father was pretty angry...",

With the tons of greasy and heavy food in and around campus, I'm not sure how most of the campus isn't in a food induced coma. :) I always leave this place full and awake!  The food here is pretty good. I usually get the Grilled Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Quinoa (about $9.00). I've tried other bowls and sandwiches, but the Chicken Teriyaki is still my favorite. It's filling, has veggies, has meat and a very, very light flavor.  I won't say this place is cheap or a affordable, I've never come out of here for under $10.00 (after tax and tipping). But I'm awake to work and take classes, which is more important.  Lastly, fresh pressed juice, pretty expensive.",

For those of you who wonder what Chop Shop is: Its not really meat (The name and logo are deceiving). Its all of the organic good-for-you salads, juices and sandwiches with a  good-for-you feel like True Foods. Some of my favorites include the Beet salad, and Power Green juice (with kale, cucumber, ginger, parsley)... They even have Protein shakes...if you are into that sort of thing (which around the ASU campus- me thinks they will have a customer base). But yes.... there is meat. You can add on chicken, steak or shrimp (or tofu) to any entre or item.  Parking is around back. I believe its the site of the old Dos Gringos.  Enjoy!",

I sat in the patio and ordered inside. My dogs were pretty calm in that space even though it is right on university. There is astro turf through the entirety of the patio area with various types of seating.  I enjoyed the kale cleanse and tri-tip protein plate that ordered. Everything came out pretty fast with the exception of my drink, which lagged behind other people who ordered after me. Oh well. When it arrived it was DELICIOUS. I can't wait to try their other drinks.  I visited on a Sunday. There were a good amount of people there hanging out but I wouldn't say that the place was busy. There is also a huge chessboard and shuffle board(???) to play out on the patio. It looks like a nice place to hang out, but I wonder how crazy it gets during the week when all the students are around. I'd definitely go back during the weekends and during the breaks, as it seems like a really chill space.",

I always binge on the iced tea, as there are usually four fruit flavors to choose from. All joking aside, I really like Chop Shop!  To the outside observer, my eating habits may appear to be disgusting--riddled with too many late night Cheetos, insane amounts of candy, and an over abundance of red meat. I like how Chop Shop makes me feel like I'm eating healthier.  The kale Caesar with shrimp is an absolute must! And the grilled tri-tip is best as a wrap. With juicy pieces of steak, plenty of lettuce and vegetables, and just the right amount of horseradish, the tri-tip wrap provides plenty of protein in a substantial, but otherwise healthy meal.  The Tempe location is great, with both nice indoor and outdoor seating options, but be wary of wait times when classes are in session. Enjoy the summer slowdown!",

The place was super cute and trendy and served a wide variety of food. The outside seating area had lights strung around, which could be seen lit up even in broad daylight. The girl at the counter was nice and smiled at us while we ordered our food. The wait for the three meals was kind of long, but we had all the time in the world to eat.  My parents and I each ordered something different, but the one that I ordered was the avocado toast. Honestly, I have never had avocado toast in my life before this experience, which would be strange to some people considering that I am the same age as avocado toast lovers. The toast came slightly crunchy, with an over easy egg and tomatoes. Oh, and they did NOT skimp out on the avocado. Honestly, the toast was SO good and made me a True fan of avocado toast. The place that took my avocado toast virginity, and turned me into an avocado toast addict. I have been craving avocado toast, but I am nervous it won't live up to the expectations that The Original Chop Shop set for me. My parents both enjoyed their breakfasts as much as me, and finished theirs all quickly with no complaints.   Overall, if you have the time to sit down and eat, I would recommend this place because the wait for the food might be long. The atmosphere has good vibes, and you don't need to be a hipster to order to the avocado toast!",

It's the perfect fast-casual place to stop in for light and healthy fare such as a juice, acai or protein bowl. I love the fresh squeezed juices, my favorite being the \"Cold Buster\" a delicious combo of fruit and veggies! (Carrots, orange, ginger, turmeric, and I usually opt to add red beets). The vibes are very trendy and health conscious, you'll find a lot of fresh fruits on display and they have a lovely little patio for outdoor seating. It's definitely a great go to for a quick and healthy lunch or snack through out the day.",

Driving 20 mins west from Gilbert,   N's choice happened to be closed and I knew this place was just down the street and open, so I asked him if we could come here. I wanted something different, something not heavy, and definitely something fresh. I got all 3 of them. Ordered the \"Cheat Day\" Wrap $7 -  Scrambled eggs, bacon, white cheddar, avocado, tomato, w/turkey & brown rice in a wheat tortilla. To.Die.For... N ordered the \"Brekkie\" $7 - He chose eggs over easy, provolone, avocado pesto, & turkey, on a brioche(?) bun. So.So.Good... One other thing we ordered that we kept staring at by the register was this huge, delicious looking cookie in a jar. We had to get it and it did not disappoint! OMG - a vegan, apricot oatmeal cookie. I think we wanted to buy the whole jar of cookies to take home! I've never had a cookie like that! With a nice brewed unsweetened black iced tea and cool, crisp ice water, we had a feel-good breakfast, with great weather out on the patio deck, and a nice and quiet tine with each other. We will be back. So frickin' amazing...",

The flavors were pretty interesting, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again.  Overall a decent spot that definitely makes you feel like you are eating healthy.",

We came here, and I thought that the menu would have been loaded with vegan options but I was extremely disappointed that it wasn't.   Anyways, I did order one of the smoothie bowls that could be made vegan and it was really tasty and satisfied the craving I had from hiking and being in the heat.   It was loaded with freshly chopped strawberries and bananas and loaded with coconut flakes with some granola as well. The portion was fairly good although, I thought it was a little bit high.   I bought a pink lady apple health-ade kombucha (I brand I hadn't tried before), and it was super tasty. I love kombucha and it is loaded with probiotics and other great health things that everyone needs to nourish your body with. So I highly recommend anyone reading this review to try kombucha if you haven't! It might take a little bit of time to grow on you but the light carbonation and slight beer taste is what I love most about it.

Highly recommend it!",

    "text": "The food was decent but not great. Was lacking a bit in flavor. Customer service here, though, is unacceptable. Server dropped a drink for another table, which got me wet. Instead of saying sorry, the server gave the girl at the other table attitude and stomped off, leaving the ice and liquid all over the floor. It was never cleaned up. I even went to the cashier to ask for it to be cleaned up since the spill was right outside a door where a customer or worker could fall. No luck. It took a good 20 minutes for that girl to get a replacement on her drink.   We waited a good 40 minutes for our food. I could tell the restaurant was \"in the weeds\", which I can forgive. What I can't forgive is when we were given the wrong order for my 9 year old daughter (was given bread instead of gluten free wrap for a child with gluten intolerance), we got a big huff from server as she again stomped off from our table. It took another 20 minutes to get the right order. When she brought the right entree back, she tossed it at my daughter and stomped off.   I don't normally write reviews but when 24 hours later my kids are still talking about the bad attitude at this establishment, it must have been pretty bad.",

I come in with my sister every now and again and it always take at least 45 mins to receive our food. Even if we were the first customers in line before a rush and it's dead.  If we order seasonal drinks, or the fruit bowls we almost always have to go back to the register and ask for it after getting our food, then we finally get them once we're done eating.  The food is usually pretty good here, but I do notice the food here isn't as well put together as the Old Town location.  Besides the long wait times, the staff can be very unwelcoming. The dudes are usually pretty cool, they don't look unpleasant, but some of the chicks straight up look like they hate working there. I'll be super friendly and still receive attitude. The ladies are never smiling unless they're talking amongst each other, then they go back to looking disinterested, or even mad once a customer comes up.  Chop shop is a cute place with awesome food, but the workers make me not want to stop in.",

    "text": "So I love ChopShop in Scottsdale so naturally I had to try the Tempe one. First off the Tempe has a lot better set up in my opinion. It's an old house right on ASU campus with a giant patio with games and a fireplace. They have a \"life size chess\" outside which is favorite part.   So I always get the beach bum protein shake when I'm there but I switched it up and got the jacked up PB + J. It's basically taste just like strawberry and peanut butter. It's good but not sure if I would order it again.   For my meal I got the chicken protein bowl. If your like me, I try to eat healthy but if it doesn't taste good I won't eat it... This is why ChopShop is always so packed. It's healthier cuisine that is amazing. My chicken bowl is just veggies, chicken, and rice. (I switch out the rice for sweet photo hash). If your in Tempe or Scottsdale this is the perfect lunch spot",

Well after watching 3 or 4 people who were behind me get their food I went over and asked if my food was coming. The guy didn't even look up at me when I was asking (rude). He scrambles over to the tickets and saw that my food ticket had been stabbed but never made, he then turns around and starts making it.   I think the thing that disappoints me most is how there are 3 people behind the counter and not one even looks up and makes eye contact. The girl who took my order should've been paying attention to think \"hey, that girl has been waiting a long time for her food... I'll ask someone what's up\"   Maybe I need to try a different location... Tempe hasn't been great.",

The cashier was not very polite about it either and they were not that busy. We went again today to get food to go and again our food sat under the counter for quite some time, no one called our name. Only after we inquired about our food did we receive it, very disappointed. If I wanted a cold lunch I would have asked for one.",

The outdoor seating area is really nice as long as it's not too hot, but you should plan to get their early or you may wait for a spot. The line tends to be pretty long, so call ahead if you're looking for something quick to go. The Danish salad and club sandwich are my usual choices, but I've heard that pretty much everything on the menu is good. Make sure you grab a drink with your lunch -- they have tasty lemonade and juices.",

I asked the guy at the counter what he would recommend drink wise since I wasn't very familiar with the drink menu and I said I will try his suggestion abs get it in a medium size, then for my food I also placed an order. I went to take a seat and saw how several to people who were treated very friendly like regulars come in order and leave. I waited so long and finally asked the guy who took my order if he knew anything about my drink order. Turns out her forgot and asked me for my drink order again. So he charged me but didn't put in the order. I was so hungry, thirsty but didn't say anything. He called me to get my drink. I drank it went back to my table and after waiting for 25 total got my food which I had to drink with water since the juice was drank way before that. I go to so any places and restaurants maybe I was expecting too much who knows. Bad customer service and so so product. I will not return no matter how modern or hipster this place is.",

    "text": "Since moving to Tempe I am literally here 3 times a week and I can honestly say with every visit there is something wrong. I've brushed it off so many times because I truly do love how healthy this place is. However, I'm finally over it. Let me just start off with the fact I usually call my order in for pick up. I'll walk in and pay for my pick up order and they either just assume it's not ready yet when it's actually sitting there across from me OR it's not ready when I arrive but when it does come out they assume I'm not there yet, once again leaving my food on the counter across from me. I can't always read the ticket and see that it's my name so I wait for a couple minutes to see if maybe I'm mistaken and my order isn't ready yet, but this is never the case. And not to mention no matter how confused you look or how long you've been standing there, none of the employees care to ask if you need help. I work at a front counter service restaurant and anytime I see someone standing around I ALWAYS make sure they are being helped. My particular issue with my most recent visit is that I specifically told the girl on the phone that EVERY time (not an exaggeration) I order the teriyaki chicken bowl, they ALWAYS forget the Brussel sprouts that are literally included in the description of the teriyaki bowl. So I ask this girl on the phone to please make a note to include the Brussel sprouts because I like them a lot. Once again, I get home, no Brussel sprouts. So not only did my food sit in front of me for 5 minutes without anyone realizing I was obviously waiting for a to go order, but she couldn't even get my order right when I specifically mention what is usually wrong with it. The employees simply just don't care. They all mingle and giggle to each other as if these customers aren't spending a ridiculous amount of money at this place. I'm still confused how their tip jar is always so full because it's hands down the most careless service I've ever had.",

I got the Powerbowl with shrimp and quinoa, and my lunch companion got a turkey chop salad. Both were absolutely delicious, and had plenty of shrimp and turkey. Often times places 'scrimp' on the shrimp, but not here. The noise level was a bit high, but not more than expected when you have so many people in a small area. It was not enough to make the atmosphere uninviting.  I hope the chop shop opens a location in Tucson soon!",

I generally pick up a medium iced (or hot ) americano and one of the delicious chocolate banana muffins. The muffin is full of giant dark chocolate chips, it's quite satisfying and the extra boost I need in the morning. I've also tried a few of the breakfast wraps and my favorite is the cheat day wrap, but you can't go wrong with anything on the breakfast menu!  For lunch or dinner my favorite item is the grinder sandwich that comes with a simple green side salad and creamy vinaigrette. My coworker swears by the tri-tip protein bowl and I can confirm it's quite tasty.  Service has always been top notch and the staff are always nice. Lunch is a little hectic so call ahead if you are taking out, but this is a great place to eat or for a morning pick-me-up.",

    "text": "The food here is great, most of the time, but the service definitely leaves something to be desired. It seems like every time my husband and I eat here we leave just a little disappointed. We've tried going on different days and during different times of the day and almost every visit we have encountered some kind of issue. During our most recent visit we called in a pick-up order at 10:40. They gave us a 10 min. wait time, completely acceptable. When we arrived to pick up our order, they said it wasn't ready. It had only been 15 min. and they were relatively busy so we gave them the benefit of the doubt. But at 11:20, so we are going on 40 min. after the original order was placed, we finally get a manager's attention, who finds our food under the counter at the registers where it had been all along. It is now cold :( He offers to refund our money. I appreciatively accept, especially knowing I now have to microwave my sandwich because I definitely don't have time to wait for a fresh one to be made. Turns out, they never actually refunded the bill, it showed up on my account a couple days later. So much for that.   Food-wise, the food is fresh but pricey for what you get. I do appreciate that they offer natural fountain sodas sweetened with agave, that is when they aren't out (which is often) and the iced tea is high quality. The rice bowls are hit and miss. We've had them a couple times and got raw, crunchy rice in both. We also tried the baked goods recently. The flavor is there but the muffins and brownies were stale and dry. Bottom line, there are better places in the valley where you will leave satisfied and with a smile on your face that are less pricey with the same high-quality ingredients and better service.  If anything, it may be worth checking out because of the historical value. It is located in an old bank building and they kept some of the features intact, like the original black and white floor tiles and a large vault door. There are also pictures in the hallway to the restrooms that chronicle the building's history.",

I'm definitely a fan of the food...the reason for the 4star rating is because of the service.  A couple in our group ordered a Shrip Protein bowl (delicious) and after everyone at the table had nearly finished eating at the table our friends received the wrong order.  My friend provided the staff with his receipt to correct the issue and 15 minutes later my friends received the wrong meal again.  When we discussed the matter with the manager there was no ownership of the issue, he only said that the ticket was lost. My friend was told that they would be happy to refund his money but he wouldn't get his food if he did that.  Over 8 Shrimp bowls went out in the hour my friends patiently waited.  Service can make or break an experience and my friends will not be coming back. I will be back for sure but It will most likely be solo!  Customer service is key!

The place itself is super cute and when the weather is nice they have lots of outdoor seating.  I ordered the chicken prosciutto sandwich and he ordered a tri-tip bowl with sweet potato hash. First of all, the portions were really big. We both only finished half of our meal and had the leftovers for lunch the next day. So it's not cheap food but if you consider you're getting two meals out of it then it's actually pretty awesome.  My sandwich was really good. The chicken wasn't dry, the arugula was fresh and there was plenty of fig spread (yum). The bread was also tasty and fresh.  Boyfriend really liked his tri-tip bowl, the sweet potatoes were a nice alternative option to the rice.  I can't wait to go back and try one of their salads. I think this is definitely going to become a new regular place for dinner.  Tip - there are a few parking spots in back so you don't have to pay at a meter.",

Their juices are to die for! It is not too pricey but not that cheap either. Sit on the patio, enjoy your juice and play a quick jumbo chess game. Happy eatings!",

This little eatery is tucked behind beautiful trees and shrubs, making you feel like you're in a garden hidden away from the busy road of it's official address.  The food is great, healthy, and fresh, but don't expect to get it quickly. There's usually only 1 register working, and sometimes two, and the food is made to order. This slow and relaxed speed tends to be the lifestyle of the Shop's many patrons. (Many are lounging next to the giant chess board or under a tree reading a kindle or lounging away.)  Both times I ate here I ordered the hummus sandwich and it is the best such sandwich I've ever had. The hummus is red so I think there's red pepper blended into it, and the other veggies along with a touch of feta cheese makes this sandwich so addicting, you can't help but spoonfeed yourself the excess hummus that got squeezed out and fell on your plate. (FYI, the bread is not strong enough for you to hold and eat the sandwich. Your best bet is to fork and knife this guy.  This place also stocks kombucha, which I love, and they have lots of blended fruit/veggie drinks that everyone I was with raved about. If you're visiting ASU, this place is a must try.",

I visit ChopShop for breakfast after working out our between classes. ChopShop is a great place for fast, healthy, and high quality food.  Some of my favorite items from ChopShop include the kale salad as a wrap with chicken, the shrimp protein bowl with sweet potato hash, and of course, the acai bowl! The breakfast is also great, I would highly recommend the sprouted grain bagel sandwich.  ChopShop also has great service! Every staff member that I have encountered delivers excellent customer service, especially one of the management staff, Kelsey. She is excellent and I look forward to seeing her every time I go to ChopShop!",

The rice was a bit crunchy still, I don't think it was cooked all the way. The shrimp bowl on the other hand was spectacular! It was a mild chile taste to it that have it so much flavor! I asked if they could make me a shrimp bowl instead and they were happy to. I was very satisfied with my meal. I just would not get the beef bowl again.   I would recommend this place to a friend!",

Seen her check-in all the time and my son wanted to try it so now here I am. It's on University across from ASU but hidden right next to The Chuck Box. I call this the little house on University.   You walk through the yard gate into a yard with table all over the front yard and into a small little house. Basically, you wait in line to order your food and drinks. Seems like there is always a line. They bring your food to your table but you have to wait at the counter for your drinks. Oh yea the menu is on a huge chalk board. This is a very healthy place. Healthy drinks. Healthy food. $5 for a 16oz and $10 for a 24 oz drink. Pricey but healthy.   I ordered the Club which had sliced turkey, with lettuce, tomato, nice thick piece of bacon, provolone cheese and pesto. Big sandwich and really good. Tasty good. It also comes with a side salad. Thy serve this on a small pizza tray with paper on top. Seems like all the sandwiches comes with a side salad. I had the Slim Squeeze drink. Don't remember what was in it but a bunch of fruit. It didn't look very good but tasted pretty good for a healthy drink.   Enjoyed the meal but just sitting outside in front of University Ave with everyone else sets the atmosphere for a fun and enjoyable lunch. A little pricey for lunch. I paid $44 for three meals and three drinks.  I think I'll probably be back when I'm I the ASU area. Healthy food. Good food. Good drinks. Enjoy.",

I understand that many of the customers are college students but I think anytime someone drops $25 for essentially vegetables, customer service is definitely expected. I was still deciding, with no one else waiting (just a few minutes ago) and her exact words to me were: 'do you know yet?..'  It was just really strange and casually not polite. Truly felt like she was forcing herself to seem interested in me ordering. And I asked her a question about the juice and just seemed to annoy her for not already knowing the answer. So then I pay the $25- I expect the high price point. I'm giving three stars because every other person was overboard friendly. A different girl hand delivered my to-go order. The cashier was just rude enough for a review to be justified. Maybe at McDonald's I'd let it go, but not here",

I had a lot of work to get done and decided to coffice rather than work out of my hotel room where I'd be tempted to take a nap.   Original Chopshop is located in a remodeled house and has indoor and outdoor seating. I decided to sit indoors I could focus on work and was so happy to find outlets by most of the tables.   Thai Chicken Grilled Protein Bowl ($9.00): Healthy  and tasty, I could eat this every single day! The forbidden black rice they use was a wonderful alternative to quinoa or regular jasmine rice.  Coconut Chia Pudding ($5.50): I make this at home and it's the perfect dessert. Much better for you than ice cream or a giant cookie.  Hot Tea ($2) Jasmine green tea and the rose: I'm a big tea fan and they were nice enough to keep me refilled during my visit.  If I lived in Phoenix this would for sure be my go-to cofficing spot and a fave for lunchtime meetings. It gets busy here but they're quick to bring out the orders.

    "text": "The Original Chopshop has always been my go-to, especially since I started college. It is a great break from dorm food or just allows me to be lazy and not have to cook my own meals. I really love that there are so many options. Whether you want to eat healthy and have a salad or a juice, or if you want something a little bit on the sweeter side like an Acai bowl Chopshop is the place to go. I also really like the fact that this restaurant takes into account food allergies or preferences, for example, I have a gluten intolerance. So it is nice to know that I can come to a place where I know they will have a lot of gluten free options for me to choose from. Although other restaurants are starting to do this, for as long as I can remember, Chopshop has been completely on top of this. They have options for just about every person whether they have an actual allergy or are just a picky eater. It is obvious that the restaurant values its customers and wants them to have the best experience possible. Just last week I went in and got the shrimp bowl (delicious as usual); I get that bowl all the time and did not realize that you can have the option to have different rice or be able to basically take out or add any food that you want. One of my friends picked apart the meal and told them to add a different rice and take out a few other things and they did not hesitate to do just that. Chopshop seems to have this idea that we can have a lot more control over what is being put into our food, which is something that I really like. Although it is obvious that I do love the food, the only bad thing two things that I really have to say is that it is a bit pricey for the little amount of service that we get. I would honestly eat there a lot more if it were not so expensive. Plus, we do not even have waiters/waitresses- we simply buy or food and wait for them to bring it to us- so it is not like we are paying for the service. If we actually had someone waiting on us then I would completely understand, yet all they do is take our order, the kitchen makes it, then they bring it to us. I have not had a bad experience with any of the people working at this particular Chopshop, everyone is very nice, I just think that the prices could be lower. Since this particular Chopshop is on a college campus, I think it would be wise to offer a student discount of some sort. A lot of students come often, however, if there were a student discount I think that the amount of people that would come in more often would skyrocket.  I do not want to write this post simply to complain about how expensive it is. Like I said before, I really do love the food and I do come often. I sometimes even come to just grab an iced tea (which I also like about Chopshop, no soda just tea) and sit and do my homework out on the patio. The whole ambience of the stringing lights outside, the couches, and of course the giant chess make it a place that I enjoy hanging out at just because it is comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. This is something that I think that this particular Chopshop outdoes all of the others in. I have been to a couple different Chopshop's around Arizona and they aren't quite like this one. This one makes it not just somewhere to grab a meal, but somewhere where you can either sit and socializes or sit down and read a good book. It is the perfect hang out spot, especially for college students!",

    "text": "I fell in love with ChopShop after trying it when I first came to visit my brother in AZ. I went to the chandler one so this time I flew down I had to try it again and this one was near the airport.   First off, this place was very hard to find for us. The directions that was given to my Lyft ride showed it in the back and we could not find it off the main street. It is such a small place that its very hard to tell from the main street where exactly its at. Good luck finding it.  I got the same thing for breakfast that I got the first time which was the Zen Bowl (egg, brown rice, mushrooms and cheese) and a green juice. My bf opted for the Avocado Toast with Egg and tomato and a green juice as well. The zen bowl wasn't as good as the last time I had it. This time the brown rice was hard and not as soft as it should be so I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first time. My bf however loved the avocado toast and devoured it within secs.   The location itself is near the Arizona State University so there are a lot of people sitting outside studying or on their breaks from school. It wasn't packed or anything but there was a lot of the outdoor seating that was taken. I prefer the other AZ location because its way more spacious and feels a bit more cleaner and a nicer area.",

    "text": "Ambiance: Small restaurant inside a former house right smack in the heart of ASU campus. Has a hipster/folksy feel to it. Lots of natural light. The patio is wonderful, lots of shade provided and great place to people watch. Patrons are the college crowd with twist of Tempe locals.  Food: Had high hopes but this place completely dropped the ball. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice. With the first bite I bite into something hard, figured it was a chicken bone. Took another bite and it happened again. On closer review it was under/uncooked rice that I was biting into (either that or stale rice). Things didn't get better with the Muscle Malt protein shake which had large pieces of ice in it instead of the normal smoothie slush you would be accustomed to.  Something must have been up with their blender. I know others rave about this place so might have caught them on a bad day. The only saving grace I could render was that they use green-biodegradable table wear.  Price: On par for most health conscious food.  Overall:  Disappointing experience but may give them a second chance. I feel College campus restaurants are usually a gamble.",

It tastes a lot better because Phoenix is just so hot! I got their cheat day wrap with bacon and turkey, and it came with avocado, brown rice and scrambled egg wrapped in a corn tortilla along with one of their 16oz fresh pressed juices. Their protein bowls and coconut chia parfait are definitely honorable mentions that my friends got, as well as their pina colada protein smoothie that was really good. I wish they had something like this in San Francisco! And especially for the price point, it was well worth it for a morning meal.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, and a small private parking lot next door. Overall it's a pretty small shop but they do have a lot of space to sit and hang out. Heard they used to have a giant chess board, but it wasn't there anymore!",

Hardest part of getting to ChopShop was the hidden parking lot entrance that's not on Mill to the dark, wobbly, and unpaved lot. The fact that there are no lights in the lot is a major safety concern for me! Had to use my iPhone flashlight to avoid breaking my ankles.   Once I made my way inside (super cute decor!), there was a bunch of friendly hello's. Despite me being there fairly late on a weeknight before ASU classes started, it was busy! The menu is what I expected - salads, wraps, bowls, shakes, etc etc. The counter guy told me they're fairly adaptable to changes on salads/wraps. My Caesar salad was just amazing! I made sure to add chicken ($2) and purchase a side of quinoa to mix in. Quinoa has a slight lemon/acidic taste to it, my guess is it's from how they cook. Delicious, nonetheless. Cannot wait to return and make this a staple part of my Tempe dining rotation!",

But the service has really really gone down in the past couple of months, and I've been coming here for over 5 years. The reason I love this place is because of the health-consciousness and ability to modify everything to your liking, but recently my food keeps coming out wrong! The other day I tried a new wrap specifically because it had avocado on it... and no avo. Then when I said something they brought me wimpy side that I had to insert into the wrap myself. Tonight I got a teriyaki chicken bowl to go and ordered the sauce on the side cause I can't eat sugar but my boyfriend likes the sauce. When I got home there was sauce all over :( its too bad cause I love this place but not when they're messing up on the whole reason I go there. Still absolutely worth a try though the food, options, juices and drinks are truly amazing.",

I ordered the beet salad with chicken and the dressing on the side and my boyfriend ordered the pitaya bowl.  The pitaya bowl was great, sweet flavorful and bright in color! However, my salad was a bit lackluster. When I got the bowl, I noticed immediately that there was no chicken. I waited for the man to come back so I could tell him and when I did he seemed a bit perplexed. After a few minutes he brought out a small bowl of chicken. Alright , now worries there. I opened the small container of dressing and put a couple drops on my salad since I don't like when my salad is drenched in dressing. As I was eating a few more bites, I noticed I didn't need anymore dressing, which was odd. As I pushed the salad to see the bottom, it was drenched in dressing which of course made me pretty disappointed. It's one thing to forget the chicken but adding dressing when I clearly asked for it on the side (since I got a small container of it) was quite annoying. If I go back I will definitely inspect my food a bit more  **update since response: I emailed about 5 days ago and still haven't heard anything back from them",

It was great, although the sweet potato hash was a little dissappointing-- undercooked, maybe. I could have done with less oil too.  But altogether this place is great!! It's fast, you can order to go, there is plenty of seating even if you're alone (bars and stools, couches) and they have tons of gluten-free options like cookies and WRAPS! Which I will definitely be coming back for.",

I get my beet salad (super yummy, fresh, and light) with a side of quinoa (love the peas in there) , an Americano to get jazzed and a Quest Bar for a snack later in the day (gotta get that protein). Sometimes I switch up and get a yogurt parfait (mango and coconut is where its at) or I just tried the Terriyaki Bowl and tried it with forbidden rice (never had forbidden rice, was actually really bomb!) Not cheap at all on the veggies or chicken like most terriyaki bowls are when I go out.  Mason is always a treat to have ring me up and bring out my food. He is super sweet, fast, and adorable! He gives excellent customer service and is very welcoming to me and my friends (they even got a picture with him because is so awesome!)  The atmosphere is very modern minimalist and is just what Tempe needed.   I would love to try some more menu items but I am such a creature of habit! Seriously...BEET SALAD!",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today. I was excited to see a new healthy option open up in Tempe. Easy to find parking in the summer, but during the regular school year it may be difficult.  First I'd like to say that the place is very cute. It's well designed and has a comfortable atmosphere. The place smells amazing when you walk in because of all the juicing going on.  There were a lot of good choices on the menu. I ordered the chicken and kale sandwich as a wrap and a small vanilla iced latte.  The sandwich was good, but a little different than I expected. It was a warm sandwich with melted cheese and sort of tasted like a Caesar wrap. It was big and came with a small side salad. Too much food for me for lunch; it could probably be split between two people. I had barely any kale in mine and would prefer to see a higher kale to romaine ratio.   The latte was very strong and sweet. I think too much vanilla not enough milk (I think they use non-fat). I topped it off with some cream and it was better, but if you are someone who likes a milkier latte you may want to tell them that when you order.  Overall I think the food here is fresh and pretty healthy. I will definitely be back to try more.  Also...it can get very busy at noon, so go a little early or late for lunch to avoid the line. I was there at 12:10 and the line was wrapped around the place, but before I even got my food the line was completely gone.",

    "text": "This was my second time to ChopShop. First time was for juice, while I was on a juice fast. Their drink combinations and build your own juices are well rounded with lots of options - but the juices are REALLY expensive, even compared to other juice places in the area. My juice was a bit disappointing as it was approximately 1/3 foam, which even I have the technology to skim off at home. In a sense the juice just became 33% more expensive.   My second time, we ordered food and tea/coffee. The tea exceeded expectations for any restaurant, great choices, variety, and well brewed. Tea house snobs might turn up their nose, but they need to get over themselves. I ordered a toddy (cold brew coffee) and they informed me they were out and began explaining the 24hr brewing process. As a fellow toddy brewer, I fully understand the issue and happily switched to the recommended iced americano. Again, expectations were exceeded, well brewed, rich flavor, over all a great cup, only surpassed by local roasters in the area. There is no shame in being a restaurant that is 2nd to local roaster, at all.   For food we ordered the Moroccan Turkey and Grilled Tri-Tip sandwiches on gluten free wraps. I don't eat gluten free, but my companion does, and we planned on sharing. Side note: gluten free wrap itself was surprisingly good! Of the two sandwiches, Tri-Tip was the star of the show, but it was missing something. I'm thinking rosemary, but try it and see for yourself. The Moroccan Turkey was disappointing. As a turkey sandwhich, it was fine. Other than grapes, I must have  missed the Moroccan piece. I felt there was nothing Moroccan about it, and I've purused Moroccan cookbooks, they aren't know for blandness. Apparently there were roasted red peppers in it, but I couldn't tell. Lastly,  maybe the spices are in the yogurt sauce, but again, I couldn't tell there was a yogurt sauce on it. I kind of feel like it was a glorified turkey avocado gluten free wrap, with grapes.   Overall, this is a solid 3 star place with potential for greatness.",

I really enjoy their beet chop and breakfast options. The juices and smoothies are great. The hydrater is my favorite - it is indeed, very refreshing.  I also really like the way this place looks. The decorations are fresh, clean and simple, and there's nice places to sit inside and outside. I enjoy sitting outside and reading while I suck down a smoothie or enjoy a latte (no more snooty cartel for me). I'm not sure how the outside will fare with this coming summer, because there are limited seats inside. If you're worried about the wait then come at breakfast around 9a. Everything is still yummy and there are fewer people. Stay away at lunch time unless you're ordering for pickup/takeout. But still check the place out. Its fresh, healthy, tasty options are sure to have you coming back and ditching the food on campus",

The decor is fresh and clever, and you can tell they put a lot of time and thought into making it look interesting and approachable. They win a big thumbs up in  cleanliness and decor categories. I would very much enjoy bringing friends here for lunch. (Cute little details, like the purse hangers on each table, and a fresh daisy made our meal even more enjoyable.)  For lunch I tried the shrimp and sweet potato hash protein bowl. The hash was incredible, I highly recommend trying it. The shrimp was very good too, but the thing that I loved was that they didn't just give me 4 shrimpy pieces - my bowl was full of shrimp and veggies. An ideal meal!  I ordered one of the fresh lemonades, and it was kinda good, but I found it lacking in a bit of flavor, plus it was super-sour.   Overall a great place that's off the beaten Mill Ave path, a good place to bring friends, or clients, and a menu that includes tons of healthy options. Can't wait to go back to try the smoothies, and their breakfast menu!",

As for the drinks, ive had the Power Green which took a few sips to get into it. A little on the tart side, the Green Glory is really yummy.  Ive also had their Bloody Mary, and i wish they would put a few more tomatoes in it.

Staff is always friendly and talkative. They have recommended me gems that haven't disappointed. I go for protein bowls with sweet potatoes usually. When I'm feeling froggy and want a treat the fruit bowls can't be beat. Wish there was a little more shrimp but I get it.",
