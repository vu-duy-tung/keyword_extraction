I was told exactly what to do in a calm manner, and I even had someone come help me make my bowl, because I had no idea what was happening. After choosing my meats and veggies, one worker explained his favorite sauces, and even helped me make the sauce just right. The cook prepared the food with a smile, and it looked very professional. Not the mention, having your food cooked on a huge hot plate is amazing! Thank you so much for my experience today! Will visit again soon!",

The food itself is good. Lots of choices and sauces. I like how they write all the sauce recipes out on the board for you so that you can make something better than whatever concoction you'll come up with.   If you don't prefer noodles- you should just fill up your bowl with beef and veggies and eat it with the complimentary rice at the end! ;)  The drink machine, soups, ice cream, and choices of brown/white rice at the end are a nice touch.",

Every thing is buffet style but uncooked you pile your bowl as high as you can get it and they have recipe for you to mix sauces together to make specialty sauce either you are the waitress  can  make them. Then you watch the chef cook the food and sauce together  in front of you . Quite an experience. I can say I honestly enjoyed there food so much I ate it for three days. Yes, I had that much left over .I ate it three more times after I left the restaurant  and it was just as delicious. Follow the lead of everyone else pack the bowl so high it seems stupid. When it cooks down you'll be the smart one. Can you say ....lunch ,dinner, lunch again all in one :)",

    "text": "One word:  Gluttonous  The fact that you can pile as much food into and far beyond the top of the bowl given to you is reason to start moving toward a 5 star rating.    In the land of opportunity where a person can stroll in and reward themselves for anything they like, usually just making it through the day without cutting your wrist, it's an American's dream.   It's sort of like a one time all you can eat buffet.  It's worth the price of admission just to see others work their magic while they pile on the food 6 inches or more above the rim of the bowl.  I believe there is an art to this master craft of self indulgence.  I was awestruck by this man who redefined the term, \"the sky's the limit.\"    I will be going back this coming week to try and either 1)  break my own record set last week  2)  To match the height of the guy I saw on this last visit  or 3)  To eclipse his mile high feat and take this to a new level.  The next best thing about this place is that for 50 cents, you can purchase a box to put whatever you don't eat in and take it with you.  If this doesn't stir up the pig pen, I don't know what will.    Oink Oink",

Not only am I creating my own stir fry but I can create my stir fry with the healthiest options possible.  Be prepared to fill your bowl with as many veggies and meat as you want.  It's pretty interesting how you are allowed to \"smoosh\" your veggies/meat down so you can fill your bowl for as much as you want.  I was going to rate this establishment a 4 star as it was not pointed out to me that the hostess should actually guide you through the process.  I kinda stumbled my way through especially with the sauce mixture. However, when I ran into the owner at the yoga studio where I practice and told her about my disappointment, she made it right by sending a gift card for a lunch or dinner for two.  Now, that is what I call excellent customer service.  YC's is a must try!!!!",

All of the ingredients were super fresh and there were a lot of options.

I've been coming for years with my son and never thought to look at the menu because there are only (I thought) two sizes. Turns out they have a kids bowl that is a fraction of the price and no one has ever mentioned it. Even tonight they asked if he wanted a small or large and I had to ask for the kid bowl. It should be offered for kids by default. Other than that the staff is friendly and keep the place nice and tidy.",

There are a lot of restaurants in Phoenix Arizona metroplex that I enjoy but I can't really say that there is anything that I really miss too much restaurant wise. I enjoy this place very much and I'm really glad that I got to try it but it can never hold a candle to the great(but now closed) hot wok cafe in Yuma Arizona and it definitely cannot spit shine the boots of Tons Mongolian Grill in Grand Prairie Texas.   If I have to go to the Mongolian Grill in Arizona this would be my top choice but to be honest with you there are not many that I know of. I have to say that Dallas has far better food than most places that I have stayed at. Plus it has a huge variety of so many different kinds of ethnic foods. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Phoenix because I have been to so many places and yet I've forgotten most of them because there were never really too many special qualities about these restaurants except for the few that I have mentioned on yelp.  All in all I have to give credit where credit is due in this place is an exceptional establishment that I have to mention because it is one of the only one going girls that I know of in Arizona and it does a very fine job feeding the people of Phoenix. I'm giving it three stars because to be honest with you even though I enjoy it here I don't miss it and I have only been here twice. I don't believe that you can go up for seconds like other Mongolian restaurant and it was a bit pricier than most Mongolian Grill so I've been to. So I'm giving it a solid three and I'm sticking with that. But you need to go try this place if you ever get the chance because it's a whole new experience if you've never tried to Mongolian Grill.",

I loved that they had recipes for sauces for those that couldn't decide. My bowl was delicious, I went with the chefs special sauce and kicked it up with siracha. The soup was a beef broth and I heavily piled on the wontons. I couldn't finish my bowl but my leftovers were great.   The only reason this isn't 5 stars is they charge for take home containers and the hostess had an attitude. And if you don't have cash you are putting that 50 cents on your debit card... Not cool really. Still I would definitely be back as the food was good and the line moved quickly.",

She happily made my mom's sauce and asked me if I needed help with mine. As we sat down another server, Jordan came up to us and asked if there was anything she could get us. We continued our dinner and I noticed the staff cleaning. This is the most I have ever seen any staff anywhere clean. They weren't just going through the motions they were actually cleaning. It was nice to see staff take pride in the restruant. Jessica came by once we were done and took our plates and thanked us as we left. I am so impressed with this location I will be back! (:",

She asked if we had been there before and explained how it all worked.  She then came by while we were selecting our food and made sure we knew how to select our food.  She came back and made our sauce for us and took our food to the cook for us.  She checked on us twice while we were eating. The food was great and Alexia made the experience a good one.

If you have someone with you take a tissue and their bowl and smash your stuff down and they can do the same.  At the end is tons of sauces and a menu board with favorite combinations.  I tend to make my own mixture of two of the sauces and double up on what they recommend because I usually have a TON of noddles and meat.  Double your sauces and you will get tons of sauce.  I recommend getting a \"doggy bag\" at the beginning because if you pile on your food you will have extra for a few days.  They are only 50 cents so it is very affordable.",

    "text": "Whenever it's my birthday and my parents ask me \"where would you like to eat?\" all I can ever think of is Mongolian BBQ. There are many places that serve similar food to this but its not as delicious or fun. It HAS to be YC's Mongolian BBQ they're the only one's who can do it right.   When you walk in you are greeted by one of the workers who will take your money soon enough. During lunch they have kids bowls only available to ten years old maximum, small bowls, which in reality aren't very small if you stuff it right, and lastly a large bowl, which is indeed very large. The smalls are about $8.50 and the larges are $9.00.  Even though its quite expensive for a bowl you get your money back quickly with how much food you get. Doggie backs are 50 cents and usually hold what you would probably have left over.   Once you have a bowl and a tray you make your way to the meat, its set up in the way of a cafeteria from elementary school with options to go on either side. You have the choice of chicken, beef, pork, turkey, and at specific locations they serve fish at night. After you grab a large amount of meat, you then have to push it down into the bowl to compact it and make it much smaller so you then have the ability to put more meat in. Once you have enough meat you then move to vegetables they have all sorts like carrots, broccoli, green onion and peanuts, there are also two types of noodles rice and wheat. After you've filled your bowl with all the magic you want now its time for the flavor. They have  sauces that range from their own house sauce, YC's own, garlic, sweet and sour, cooking wine. They have boards above head instructed to tell you what to put in your bowl, but you can also be as creative as you want, it may not be the most appetizing. Once you have all the sauce ready you then work your way to the cooking area. Depending on what location you're going to there is usually more than one person working on the grills, which are large, heated circles. For about thirty-to-sixty seconds they walk around in a circle cooking your food. Once finished they then give you a new bowl and tray to keep everything nice and clean which is a nice touch. You then have a choice of getting brown or white rice, chips and a drink  The best thing to get when you arrive there is their signature Teriyaki, I of course make it with chicken and put little to no veggies in, I've never liked them, but I love the wheat noodles. As soon as I get my food its right to the white rice and chips to top off the wonderful plate. I start with the rice because my meal is so hot until I drench it with soy sauce. Once it has cooled I dig in with my chips to soak up the sauce and eat the delicious and perfectly seasoned chicken. I have never finished a bowl but it makes a good two or three more meals.  Overall I love this restaurant and I love how hands on and clean and genuinely nice it is. If you don't go here, I will go for you, if you pay of course. Enjoy!",

The hostess asked if I'd been there before, to which I said: 'No'. She explains how a buffet works and then went thru an example meal with me. Very nice service.   As I made my way thru the line, what she had said made perfect sense. This location offered small sheets of paper to 'squash down' the bowl, so you can fit more. Never saw that at the other locations.   The meats were frozen but shaved thin so they cook up on the hot table. You the fill your bowl with whatever you can fit, sauce it to taste and then hand it to the cook, who pours it all out onto his hot table, cooks it and then returns it to you in a fresh bowl.  They offered chopped nuts for finish, something the other locations didn't have. The entire staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The spicy beef soup was okay but I would've liked to add some vinegar. Very good meal tho.   The overall experience and value at YC's was excellent and I would highly recommend this location.",

Then someone else came over to help us with the sauce.   The guy who cooked was also very helpful and friendly.  Then there was another little girl who came to our table.    And most of all it actually tasted damn good.  for some reason I thought the white rice was especially good.  I try to make it like that at home but I'm not Chinese so I screw it up I guess.  I did not like either of the soup options.  I had a green tropical tea which was outstanding.  Generally I like coke this place has Pepsi but they have 5 tea options so that more than makes up for it.  I got the small bowl and I stuffed it mashed down to get as much as possible.  Which ended up being too much.  I had beef which was really taste I think because they slice it thin.  I added broccoli and mushrooms. I know it sounds simple with all the options but it was a great combo.  with sweet and spicy.  The girl even showed me some spicy oil to make it more spicy.  At first I was hoping for shrimp which they don't have. The fish option is Alaskan cod. I highly recommend the beef.  I try to stay away from beef but this was worth it.  The other thing I noticed was the staff really cleans the tables and booths. Which I appreciate.  How many times do you go to restaurant and sit in a booth that has crumbs.",

Hoping that it was just a one time thing.   My hubby and I are here the other night. Normally this place is great and I would give 5 stars. But this time both of our food has made us sick. I have a while to go box I can't eat and $30 down the drain. Very disappointing. Service was crappy and the food making us sick has made us not want to go back to this location.",

My nephew finished before all of us and one of the associates even helped him get the crunchy chips things and a drink while we finished cooking our food!  I wish I'd caught their name because it really made him feel special.   I like to create my own sauce instead of following the recipes...lots of garlic and spicy hunan. I also overload the sesame seeds on top for a little crunch...great, now I'm hungry!!!",

Perfect small kick and so much flavor but not too rich. Good price - large bowl = 12$ and unlimited for $14. Can't take anything home but wonderful post workout meal. I added brown rice and no noodles and this was just great nutrition and energy and flavor. Wonderful surprise find!!   Also the gentleman at the front register asked if we had been here before and when we said no he walked us through everything and was super friendly. Love it!",

The staff is always super nice with an inviting attitude. The food is spot on and they provide wax paper to mash down food/sauce into your bowl. By now you're probably aware that the key is to get as much food in your bowl as possible. If you're not planning on eating much, get the small bowl--you'll still be filled by the end of the meal. ;)  I definitely recommend dinnertime over lunch. For a couple dollars more you get the Alaskan cod option with the other meats, and ice cream (cone or cup, soft-serve vanilla/chocolate). If you are unable to finish your meal, to-go containers are only 50 cents each, quite a deal in my opinion! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves large portions of healthy food.",

    "text": "I love YC! I wish they had a location in San Diego. Well, they do (Great Khan's) but each location varies and the service isn't always consistent.   I came here to eat around noon and it was packed already. Surprisingly, the line went by really quick. There's always a strategy of how to make your perfect YC bowl to get the bang outta' your buck. The last time I went, I choose the large bowl but I think it's better to choose the small bowl because I never finish it at the restaurant. I always end up taking another portion home with me for leftovers.   Step#1: Choose whatever type of meat you want and tenderize it with your fists.They also provide small baking sheet papers to smush them if you don't want to get your fists dirty.  Step#2: Build your broccoli barrier around your bowl.  Step#3: Layer on your favorite veggies onto of your meat and secure your broccoli barrier if you have to.  Step#4: Layer on your noodles. Personally, I like the udon noodles better than the other noodles that they have.  Step#5: Create your special kind of sauce. They have a variety of sauces that you can create or you can remake a sauce that YC has already created. The recipes are located on the wall above the cooking stations.  Step#6: Bring your bowl to the cooking station and the chefs there will cook it for you! The chefs are super friendly and nice! :) At this point, I like to add fresh pineapples and cilantro after they have finished cooking my meal. It's super delicious, definitely a must try if you love pineapples and fresh cilantro.   Step#7: Don't forget your drink, rice, Sriracha, and soup! They have 2 different kinds of soups but their veggie soup is delicious and also my favorite. Perfect to go along with your meal.  I feel like for this particular location, they have less ingredients compared to the other locations. They just have your basic assortment of veggies. Customer service is great, their employees come by to check up on you and clear the tables. If you don't finish your meal, you can get to go containers but they'll charge you for it. I believe it's just 50 cents.  Overall, I think it's worth it! I would definitely recommend this place to every foodie! :)",

I walked in and ordered a huge bowl - seemed like a good price at $11.50 for a bowl, drink, and rice. Food was great and cooked well.  The fun thing started when I checked my credit card that I was charged $29 instead of $11.50. Interestingly, I remembered that the lady who charged me at the hostess desk didnt even offer me my receipt. A few days later, I called the manager and let him know. He took down my name, address and how much I was overbilled, and told me that he would send me a check in the mail and call me when he did so. Two weeks, and I am yet to hear from him.  Most of all - no apology for screwing a customer and over billing him.  Needless to say, I am never going back when I am back in town for business. I have also let our team of 500 employees in the building next door about this issue. I am guessing a lot of folks are interested in never going back.",

    "text": "Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.    The meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.  But wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.  I will go to Genghis Grill instead.  Quality trumps quantity any day (not to mention actual service.)  Even the Mongolian Grill at the Banner Desert hospital cafeteria is better as far as taste and quality goes (not to mention WAY cheaper.)",

When we left we saw the thermostat was set to 84.  The cook also used a lot of water while cooking causing no flavor what so ever for either of our meals.  The hostess asked others around us how their meals were but avoided asking us (I was not eating my food).",

Only gripe is that I wish they had more seafood options (choices of fish or shrimp that you didn't have to pay extra for) but obviously I get that since seafood is expensive. Cool local place to get food for a date or a night out with friends and since you're the one choosing what's in your bowl, the end product is really up to you.",

I have frequented this place since 97' worked there when I was in high school washing dishes, and have seen how far the owner has taken his business and it just goes to show that Genghis Grill and all the others need to up their game.  Prices have gone up but lets look at the cost of living and gas and all of the things that we use as a daily need.  Still AWESOME SERVICE, Meat selection has grown a bit, veggies are still the same, and newest addition are the noodles and sauces.   6 ladles of YC's own, 3 of garlic, 3 of cooking wine, 4 of the orange sauce, 3 ginger, 2 cooking syrup, and 3 seconds of seasame oil. brings out a nice sweet taste with a bit of salty.  The saying goes you get what you pay for and I pay for a small bowl at lunch and turn it into 2 togo boxes.   Jeff keep up the good work, my family loves your place",

    "text": "I hadn't been to this location of YC's in about 15 years, but I stopped in today for lunch with my kiddo and Papa.  Kids are charged 55 cents x their age for a kid-sized bowl.  Adults are charged  $9.50 for a small bowl or $10.50 for a large bowl.  We opted for large bowls to ensure we had leftovers.  The price of the meal includes soft drinks.  They normally charge 50 cents per takeout container, but they waived the fee since we hadn't been there in such a long time.  They also charge you $1 for soft serve, which my daughter insisted on having after her meal.  The hostess was extremely helpful in getting us set up.  She gave us some wax paper to push down the ingredients and encouraged us to pack our bowls as much as possible.  Then she came back and even made our sauces for us.  We must have looked helpless, but it was fine with me.  I appreciated the help!  Then she came by to ask if my food was spicy enough, since I had indicated I liked food spicy.  It wasn't (but I was resolved to accept it), so she brought me some hot chili pepper sauce in a cup; that did the trick.    The food was pretty good.  Best of all, it was a great price.  I like this location of YC's slightly better than the Elliott location.  I think the personal service made such a big difference.  I will be back soon!",

They wouldn't let us split a bowl between two people or order any bowl smaller than a large bowl. It's a lot of food! Then when we asked for a take home box they wanted to charge $.50/box. Not everyone wants to eat that much food in one sitting so they should be willing to offer smaller options or not nickel and dime you for take out boxes.",

I pick lots of mushrooms. I add tofu to add protein. Pour on sauces to flavor. They have recipes posted to guide you. Then hand your bowl over to the chef and he cooks it and gives you it back all nice and hot in a clean bowl. You can then add a bowl of rice, get a bowl of soup, a glass of something to drink and you're all set.  I used to eat here a lot when I lived in Mesa. We were up here so stopped in and enjoyed lunch.

However, the people there were being careless and letting the part of the tongs that their hands touched fall back into the food! C'mon people, that's gross!  I think YC's should develop a way to reduce the transfer of germs to food - like maybe installing hooks where the tongs can be hung so they are not thrown back into the food?  Also maybe a hand sanitizer station before entering the buffet line?  Just throwing ideas out there!  Overall, a good healthy dining experience.",

I go once a month for lunch and it's always enough for 3 full meals!  That makes it a really good value.  You have to stuff your bowl with meat and flatten it out with the wax paper that is available, then add the veggies and noodles of your choice.  They have rice noodles too, so if you need to be gluten-free, this place is great.  I have the staff make my sauce, it always turns out better for some reason.  There isn't a lot of Chinese food to choose from in the valley, so this is where I get my Asian food fix!  The soups and rice are good too, and for $1 additional you can get ice cream.   Good stuff.",

Now, I won't talk about the food, flavors or quantity you get with your meal. That's been covered by pretty much everyone. And suffice to say, if I wasn't a fan I wouldn't have kept coming back. And over the years, the place definitely has improved itself. It has added more variety of vegetables sauces to be added to your meal, and adding the two-lane system now in place definitely improved the speed at which people are able to load up their bowls. In short, I love this place.   So why have I only given it 3 stars? Well because I remember how I could come in and get a great meal (and often a meal for later) for $8 including my to-go box. I get it that the cost of items goes up. I get it that operating costs go up. I was ok when the price went to $10. I was somewhat satisfied when the price went to $12 (though the frequency of my visit definitely decreased). Now the price is $14. The frequency of my visits will cease completely. I love YC's, but I just can't justify the price anymore.",

This is the first one I have been to where you have to pay more if you want to make up more than one bowl of stir fry. The difference between a single bowl versus unlimited was $2.00 so whats the point of that? Then they have an ice cream machine near the soda dispensers but there is a big sign that says if you want ice cream, go back to the register and pay another dollar. Why not just charge one price for all? Anyway the meat and veggies were good but no seafood available. The sauces were OK but there was only one guy cooking so it took some time to get yours made up even with few people there. The place was not as clean as I would have liked but whatever. It wasn't awful but I'd not make a point to go here again.",

Come here with some strong fist and smash your meat all the way to the bottom and that is how you get more food!! It was fun. I like that they have bamboo shoots veggies that's the only veggie I get, and really it's magic that even if you put a little bit of all the sauce they have, still comes out very tasty! So you don't have to really worry about your food not coming out yum, the amazing cook will probably do the magic! By the way, small bowl to me would be good for 2 decent size meals!",

    "text": "When you think Mongolian Grill, what comes to mind? The obvious: choose your own ingredients, sauce, portion size, and get it cooked as you please.  That's exactly what you get here, except for one crucial difference: it's all so fresh! I've been eating YC's at this location for a decade, and I have yet to eat a meal that I would describe as anything less than delicious.  The service is friendly and great, the food quality is much better than your typical Mongolian Grill, and--oh god--the amount of food you can get is obscene.  Seriously, if you go in with a strategy and an iron will, you can pack an ungodly heap of whatever you wish to eat into (and, let's be honest, stacked precariously above) a bowl, watch them cook it (with water, mind, not oil), and eat until you feel like you need to go to confession.  At lunch, it's eight bucks and a quarter for a small bowl, nine two five for a large, but you can easily get a full meal plus an extra takeout meal out of that.  Dinner is buffet, for eleven bucks, but you also get as much frozen yogurt and other stuff as you can possibly stomach.  And did I mention that it can be pretty healthy? Again, the ingredients are fresh, and you get to tailor it to your own taste as much as you please.   I've eaten at a lot of Mongolian Grill places I've regretted, afterward, but in the countless times I've eaten at YC's, I've always been pleased with what I ended up with. Tip the cooks; they are awesome.",

    "text": "YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.  YC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles.",

This place is a great lunch or dinner spot, and if you go easy on the wonton chips and frozen yogurt, it's actually quite healthy too.  My favorite part is watching people work their \"techniques\" on how to structurally build the tallest mountain of stir fry, and then somehow cover it in sauce.  I usually get a huge dinner and a full box of left overs for lunch the next day out of one large bowl...but I'm a mere amateur.  Hint: multiply the sauce recipe by at least 1.5 because some of the cooks let half of it run off the hotplate before they start stirring.  I usually just make an extra little dish of it on the side and pour it on after they've cooked my bowl.  YUM!",

    "text": "Sorry folks, but this place is terrible.  I had heard my friends raving about it for awhile, but finally had the, uh, \"opportunity\" to try it out myself.  When I first walked in, I noticed it was just $9 for a big bowl, far cheaper than what I'm used to paying at Genghis Grill.  Sounds good, right?  Well, when I got to the food selections, I noticed a few things.  First, the meat was frozen. Second, there are only four meat options (frozen chicken, frozen beef, frozen turkey, and frozen pork).  Third, the vegetable selection is limited.  You'll have your lettuce, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, noodles, tofu, and bean sprouts, but there's not much more.  No eggs, baby corn, or anything else that might be interesting.  Oh, and no dry seasonings.  The sauces were encouraging.  I liked the idea of mixing and matching the different components.  After I tasted my food, however, backtracked on the sauce.  My bowl was quite soupy, but very bland.  The sauces have almost no flavor whatsoever.  Now I know why they provide that hot mustard... You need it if you want to actually taste something.  The portions were great, but I didn't even finish mine because it was just a bland, soupy mess of frozen garbage.  I think I'll spend the few extra bucks on Genghis.",

    "text": "Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.  I have seen this type of grilling in the mall before but never actually felt the urge to dine there. I came here with friends who walked me through the experience. First of all, it is a stand alone restaurant. When you enter the door you pay $9 for the bowl and $0.50 for a togo box for your leftovers.  For the quality of food,  I think $9 is over-priced.  You are really paying a premium for the \"experience\" of watching someone sloosh around your food on a grill.  It is the express version of benihana.  You walk up to a buffet line and the first thing you see is a box of wax paper.  Those little squares they use when you get donuts.  You grab a couple sheets and proceed to the assorted meats (chicken, beef, pork) and a white fish (cod??) which were all frozen. These items are usually used for chinese hot pots. The quality is mediocre. Next in line are assorted veggies, tofu, and then an array of sauces.  You pick and choose.  As you fill up the bowl, people are using those wax sheets to moosh down the food to maximize space.  Add an item then smoosh.  Repeat.  The meal comes with soda, soup, rice, and frozen yogurt machine.  The best part of the meal was the service.  They are continually replenishing the ingredients and ensuring a cleaning station.  The cashier walked around to check on everyone's meal.  She even offered someone a new bowl since they didn't care for their creation.  That is service!  So even though the food was eh, the service made up for it.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars  Lunch time it's $9.00 for a large bowl and a drink.  Comes with unlimited brown or white rice and soup.  Not a bad deal at all.  This is your typical Mongolian BBQ spot... thin frozen meats, veggies, sauce, slap onto round grill, eat.  My only complaint with this place is I feel there are too many sauce choices.  My favorite Mongolian BBQ spot (near UCLA) had two options:  garlic Yes/No and spicy Yes/No, other than that the sauce master did his work and the dish turned out amazing.  YC's has like 10 different sauce combination they present to you and I feel that the last 3 times I've been here I could have chosen better.... but frankly, I don't know because I never remember which one I chose previously.  In this case, like AbuJ likes to say, too much customization is not good.  Perhaps I'm just \"chasing the dragon\" and trying to get it to taste like my favorite UCLA joint and I'll never reach that high again no matter how much I try, but damnit, I'm going to try a few more times since UCLA is a 6hr drive on a good day.  The hostess / cashier was easy on the eyes, as was the sauce girl.  Both pretty friendly too.  Girls tend to flirt with me, so nothing unusual here.  +.5 stars for this.",

    "text": "I was so excited to finally try the place I ended up being early.  We paid our admission to the food funhouse that is YC's and then got down to business.  Armed with bowls the size of our heads, we stepped to the buffet and I got my first look at what I was up against.  The first third of the buffet is filled with shaved curls of frozen meat in various varieties.  Beef, Chicken, Pork, Alligator and Yak.  Frozen curls of Yak!  Okay so I lied about the Yak and the Alligator.  But you never know.  They SAID it was beef and chicken, but seriously, it could have been Yak!  I grabbed the tongs and threw a pile of meat in the bottom of my bowl.  I smiled at my accomplishment but she just looked over slightly concerned and then handed me a sheet of wax paper.  \"You need to smash it down.\" she said.  \"What?\" I replied? \"The meat,\" she explaind patiently.  \"You need to smash it into the bottom of your bowl.\"  \"But I'm not that hungry!\" I protested.  \"You will be and this is gonna last you for days.  See that guy on the end? Your bowl is supposed to look like that.\" She pointed towards the end of the buffet where I saw a towering mass of vegetables rising out of an already unfathomably large bowl.  It would easily feed a family of four.  His YC fu was impressive, but I was sure I could top that.  \"Get Smushing,\" she said as I refocused on the task at hand.  After I had pressed all the pretty curls of meat into a flat unrecognizable blob that filled the bottom half of my bowl, we moved onto the vegetables.  If you've had it in \"Chinese\" food, it was there.  I zeroed in on some celery, cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and baby corn.  I piled it on with gluttonous abandon, gleefully shaping my mountain of food to resemble the peak from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  The last third of the buffet contains sauces.  Many many many sauces.  Get them, they are good.  They have recipes but seriously, who wants to read directions?  I needed more sauce than I took and I thought I took a lot.  It would have helped to know they were going to slap it on a grill and immediately start diluting it with water.  Seriously, I put like five or six scoops of various stuff in and it was still just barely sauced enough.  I supplemented with some spicy mustard.  So um.. then they cooked it, and we ate it.  Sure it was good.  Yes I still have leftovers.  No you can't have them.  Is the food here the best I've ever had? Hell no.  But it's pretty good for fast/cheap/healthy-ish stuff and seriously who cares? They let you play with it for like half an hour before you even sit down.  Score!",

It is clean, has plenty of seating, the service is quite good, and the price is right.  I like that the meat is at the beginning of the line and the noodles at the end of the line.  (Anyone who is familiar with Mongolian BBQ will understand the architectural importance of putting the meat in the bowl first instead of trying to pile it on at the end.)    $8 for a small bowl and $9 for a big bowl.

The Spicy Beef soup is excellent.     I believe the price is $9 lunch and $10 dinner for which you get a serving of ice cream.   And you will have leftovers so just go ahead and get a to-go box for $.50 more.  My box is always filled to the top as if I hasn't eaten anything, but the reality is that I am stuffed and you just get so much food here.

Well...while every other Mongolian grill out there is looking to compete via different sauces, meat over ice instead of frozen, or who's grill stick is longer, YC's decided to take it old school with some good ol' customer service.  This isn't just a customer service experience, these people have it down.  They offer what they can instead of wasting time explaining what they can't, they make an effort to say hello and goodbye, and the best part? It's not overbearing either. Let's just say even if you hypothetically brought someone from the complain capital of the world (Boston) the complaint box would be empty.  /rant  YC ftw!

As we arrived there wasn't that many people, I was relieved and allowed me to ask my sister 101 questions about what to do. I ended up making a concoction of beef, carrots, broccoli, rice noodles, sprouts with chef's favorite sauce. It turned out good but I know that I was missing something. I tried some of my sisters bowl and that was really good.  So, this place is a build-your-own bowl, piled high if necessary, and watch it cook right in front of you.

The vegetable selection seemed endless and had more variety than any other one I've seen (yum, kale).

All in all, it was a great filling lunch walking distance from where I was getting my tires worked on.

If you haven't been to YC's before  the employees make sure to explain the process and how the sauces work.  Side note I like that you get a separate bowl for the Sauce.  In the past  you had to add it to your full bowl of food before it was cooked.  Make sure to check out the soups and ice cream. The ice cream is free  during dinner. For lunch there is a fee.

Then we walked over to the line of food to start filling out bowls. Wow they had quite the selection of vegetables and protein even tofu. As we got closer to the sauces a very nice lady, Janet helped me with putting my perfect sauce together and let me tell you it was the perfect taste. Then we took our food to the grill and they started cooking away which was done very quick and the gentlemen was also very nice. All around this by far has been a great experience.  Food was delicious Presentation looked great Staff was friendly  Fast but quality service   I will be back :)",

If you're super hungry, this is the place for you.  -The employees are super friendly! They were more than willing to help with whatever we needed. For that, I increased my rating one star.  - Just like any other Mongolian grill restaurant, you can customize it to suit what you're in the mood for. They have a great selection of veggies and meat. They have a ton of noodles. You can also choose from brown rice or white rice (side note, it is not cooked in with your meal.   Cons:  - I really felt like it was a game of \"how high can I pile my noodles.\" It's a waste of food, in my opinion. And I get it, you can take your leftovers home but most people I saw around me did not.  - While the selection of food was good, it did not taste that great. I had the chicken and beef. The meats were shaved and frozen. It was dry, even though I drenched it with a custom sauce. The soup choices were a veggie beef or a chicken noodle (maybe?). I felt just super confused, as my brain doesn't associate a veggie beef soup or chicken noodle with Mongolian.  - There were a lot of people in the restaurant and the flow of getting your food was a little chaotic. Again, had the employees not been helpful, I probably would've just left. Bc there were so many people, it made getting food difficult and simply messy.   Overall, if you're looking for a massive food experience with super nice employees and don't mind giving up food quality, this is the place for you.",

I went in, there was a guy at the front desk and I see him giving a huge bowl and saw them go to the right and take the food by themselves and I was surprised cause I've never been in such place. Important: say \"welcome\" to every customer! And they did. The first thing I'm lookin when I go to a restaurant is the entrance (small but nice) ., and the second thing is how clean the restaurant and it was quite clean surprisingly in the fact that everyone is eating a huge bowl full of food. Anyway I go to the guy at the front desk, and I told him it is my first time and he smiled a huge smile(like he know what my reaction gonna be) and he explained to me how it goes and I paid the huge bowl and he walk with me in and tell me to fill as manny as I can and give me peace of paper to shrink the food with force to be able to put more(with the paper to not get dirty)and obviously I was shocked in a good way. From there comes the adorable lady that tells me welcome and she's here to help me for the first time, and I was happy. She helped me with the ingredients and everything that I needed, I pot the bowl at the cook area, and the guy over there was nice and cooked very good my food and afterwards every body told me to have a great day which is very important this days in a restaurant. I want to say that it was a great experience and very good customer service, I wold love to go there again and experience more food with them. I will definitely recommend this place and will refer to my friends and family. Thank you.",

There were extremely low varieties of the protein options with only processed chicken tasting really bad and no shrimp option at all. The fish was also alaskan cod which was not tasty at all. Given the overall price and rival restaurants in the vicinity serving much better food with better variations and more options at a much competitive price, I would really wish that YC takes note of this in order to make some improvements. Also the defined sauce mix for various spice levels as specified should be revised too to make it tastier as for me even after ordering a mildly spicy sauce mix my bowl tasted totally bland. The only good part of the entire experience was however the nachos which were really good. However I would still like to suggest to work upon the main bowl rather than to increase options in the complimentary sections like the nachos or the drinks or the icecream",

    "text": "YC's? Because!  When I first moved to the Phoenix area, I discovered the most beautiful Mexican-American woman in the world...working at YC's Mongolian Stir Fry. In fact, having sampled several locations in the valley, the owner seems to be fond of hiring the most beautiful Mexican-American women. I don't really care but it is distracting when I eat there twice a day.  If you've never tried Mongolian Stir Fry, basically you put raw ingredients into a bowl, add sauces and it is cooked on a big, hot surface. After a couple of minutes, BING! Lunch and dinner and another lunch, if you know how to \"play\" the system at YC's.  There are no \"going back for seconds,\" so plan accordingly. You get your bowl and pay $10 (children are charged by age or just get them a small bowl).  Your first step is loading in the meat. Huh-huh! The meats are sliced and frozen. Place a good amount in the bowl and press it down with the papers at the end of the bar. I like to then go to the fry station and load some peanuts in the bowl and put on some hot chili oil. Then I load on assorted vegetables, tofu and noodles. Then I add the sauces. Some locations have \"sauce experts\" who take a brutal ribbing for having that on the back of their shirts. Imagine a beautiful Mexican-American woman with that on her shirt. It gives you ideas. Impure ideas.  Honestly, the line method is meat, veggies, sauce, then step up to the fry station, add sesame seeds, peanuts, pineapple and/or assorted oils and such and the chef will cook it for you. I do it by jumping around (when there's no line of people behind me) so the sauce sits on the meat (huh-huh!) and isn't all sitting on the noodles. Don't worry about overloading the bowl a mile high of your food choices. It cooks down and the idea is taking stuff home. They actually encourage it (take out boxes are 50, so it's a profit scam...deal).  Add a bowl of all-you-can-eat-and-stuff-into-the-baggies-in-your-pocket rice (white or brown) and soups (always two kinds) and you are in heaven...with beautiful Mexican-American sauce experts! Huh-huh!  Please don't forget to tip the cook a dollar per bowl and leave a couple of bucks for the girls who have to clean up the table...scrubbing and bending. Cleaning up after such a dirty, dirty boy. Mmmmmm-ah!",

This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \"grill warriors\" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to \"mongo\" at YC's Mongolian Grill!",

The young lady at the counter was very nice and helpful after I told her that it was our 1st time there. She walked us thru the whole build our bowl process and even helped with our sauce selection.

I love YC's because: -Great selection of veggies, amazing selection of sauces and most are very low calorie.   -Extremely quick cooking time w/ friendly service -I love the whole grain options for noodles and brown rice. -I love that you get soup, wontons, rice, and drinks with your meal price.    Could improve with more protein selections, like seafood.  Not a big deal though.  I have gone here nearly once a week every since I first went here.  Its a great fast lunch place.

Pretty good stir fry as well! More than anything, I was amazed with how understanding the owner was and would recommend this place for service!",

    "text": "We went here on Valentines Day for a girls night out (being single doesn't mean you have to be miserable!), it was my first time at a YC's! Another friend of mine went to the one on Elliot, and she raved about it to me. I completely forgot until we went here on the 14th!  We arrived before they closed, what's nice is that they let you eat your fill if you don't pull a dick move and arrive at 8:45pm to eat with a large group. I'm not a big fan of buffets, after visiting one with my family in California, I became completely discouraged with the rampant shouting kids, claustrophobic tables and chairs that made you turn sideways to walk down isle, and some of us ended up with food poisoning since the waiters weren't keeping the place clean - but YC's has given me a good outlook on family sit-down buffets. At least, arrive after 8pm so parents have to take the kids home for bed on a weekday haha!  After paying we walked down the line, a lot of people were piling it up, my friend helped me figure it out which was really simple. The girl at the cash register was nice also and helped with the instructions on how to get the food.  One thing I really loved about YC's was that above the area where they fry your food up, there is a huge chalkboard on all the different Asian sauce mixes you can have for your dish! I ended up making Curry-yaki, and it was REALLY good, it reminded me of eating in a Japanese food court while in California!  YC's is a clean place, not loud and obnoxious after 8pm on a weekday, and people are polite while you're waiting for your food in line. I want to try this place out again so you can count on me coming back!!!",

I have taken bites out of everybody's bowl at my table (with permission, or at least warning), all pretty much the same. Not a bad thing, just tastes like YC's. Other than that, all seems to have been said in the other 90 reviews  Go for lunch, fill up on wontons and soup while you're there, pony up $.50 for the ToGo Box and you get three good meals for $10. (But I do remember when I could ditch class at SCC and hit up that location for lunch for $5, but then again you could get a pack of smokes at that Chevron for just over $3 back then as well. Inflation sucks, YC's doesn't, Man I'm old)",

Great sauce/seasoning items, and a recipe board if you don't feel like winging it. You get steamed white or brown rice, wonton soup, and my favorite, fried crunchy noodles with sweet & sour sauce for dipping. And if you didn't stuff your face enough on noodles, rice, and soup, they have self serve ice cream too. The only thing that sucks is that if you don't finish your food, which you probably won't, they charge you $0.50 for a to-go box. Great leftovers though. You can throw it in a pan and it's almost better than the first time.   My kids love it because they can put whatever they want or don't want in their food, and they eat it all up!",

Even though this is a self service based restaurant, the customer service is always tops.  The cashier is always pleasant and the cooks/grillers are always attentive.  The buffet style line to select your ingredients used to be single file one line.  A few  years back they expanded to two lines and two grills; very helpful on weekend nights with ASU in session.  The food selections and sauces are consistent and tasty.  The diner/fast food style seating is just fine with me, we always choose a booth.    Not sure if this location is still owned by the body building man who was always checking our tables for satisfaction, but either way this is one of the staples of our diet.",

It was about 6:30 and it wasn't that busy so that was nice.  It didn't take long for me to fill up my bowl with goodies to the brim and drown it in sauce.  I did mess up a bit with the sauce because it didn't turn out as spicy or as flavorful as I would have liked but it was still great.  In my opinion I don't come here nearly enough.  I probably only say that though because I purposely didn't view their nutritional info so I'm convinced it is relatively healthy.  I mean its not fried fast food stuff, right?  Anyway I love eating here.  The food is great for what it is, the price is right and the service is very good.  Plus I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.

The only oddity in the food line was the tomatoes... the slices are ENORMOUS!!  Seriously, they're 3-4 times larger than what you'll find at other Mongolian places. I have no idea why. I can't imagine anyone wants to eat that large of a bite.  The hostess was very knowledgeable regarding food allergies. They even provide a special tag to let the employees and cooks know when they need to take cross-contamination preventive measures.  Their selection of sauces is wider than most other Mongolian places we've been. They also have a good variety of dry seasonings that really added noticeable flavorings.   I'll officially plant my request to open a location or two along the I-17 corridor!",

You start with ordering a small, large, or endless bowl, at a decent starting price of around $13 for the small, which you fill up at the buffet style ingredients bar, which offers an assortment of Asian ingredients, and your able to pack the ingredients down in the bowl to make room for more food. At the end of the buffet line sauces await with instructions to flavor your bowl with many different Mongolian flavors (I had the Mongolian beef and it was pretty good, but I needed to add a lot soy sauce). After filling up on sauce, you hand your bowls over to the chefs, who cook your food right in front of you on an open circular Mongolian grill (it's cool). Staff was excellent and attentive and help new comers with any questions.",

I get up to the grill, the cook places my food on the grill, pours on my sauce, then proceeds to dump a pitcher full of water on it and washed all of my sauce away.

If you avoid carbs and dairy, this has a lot of options. It's also easy to be vegetarian.  Staff were super friendly and helpful.  I felt the price was reasonable- get a big bowl and take (at least) half of it home with you. I didn't even have space for the soup. I liked that drinks were included and their tea selection was pretty good.  For actual food quality, it's about what you would expect for a place like this. You have to know how you want your ingredients sauced. I was really disappointed there was no teriyaki. There are fewer sauce options than at most similar places.  In short, not a place for a super gourmet experience, but not bad, especially if you want Asian-esque flavors without carb-based dishes.",

As with many Mongolian BBQ restaurants the main appeal is packing as much protein and vegetables as you can into a small bowl and getting to watch chefs cook it on a large hot plate.   Whenever I go here I always bring friends so they can join in the fun. I've tried to show them how much stuff you can pack in with the wax paper but some are more into packing than others.   I enjoy YC's wide selection of ingredients and sauces. With some many choices you could make hundreds of different combinations. This is especially relevant in the sauce section because of how the different flavors available to mix and match. Above the stoves there are lists of sauce recipes that you can try if you want a specific taste, or you can be like me and just go nuts with what sounds good.   One important rule to note is that only what is in the bowl is going to be cooked. If anything falls on your plastic tray it's not going to be included. So be strategic with your stacking.",

Each of us created our yummy dishes and still had leftovers to take home.  The tables were clean and the staff did a great job checking in on us.

I went here for about 3 years of my 4 years living in Arizona and it never seemed to disappoint. The service is always fast, and friendly so it made me come back. The food is awesome and the sauce mixing is interesting because you can really become very creative with what you choose as your ingredients to add to make your sauce.  I find the food here to have a lot of flavor, the sauces unique, and the setting inside is a standard set up with booths/ dinning tables around the restaurant. If you are looking for something a little more formal this is not the spot to-go but for a quicker bite on a budget but hungry it is perfect. The price is appealing, the food is excellent, the set up is casual so it is hard for me to say anything negative. It is one of the places I truly miss now that I am no longer in Arizona!",

    "text": "As a first timer I was quite surprised as to the friendly service offered!  A pretty young lady greeted us at the door.  She took us to the big row of food ingredients, gave us trays and explained  how and why to use certain ingredients.  It's a help yourself to the ingredients and then we will cook it for you on 2 very large round grills.  We put all sorts of proteins like beef, pork, chicken and cod fish in our metal mixing bowls, either small or large, and there are 2 prices, 12$ or 13$ posted for each.  Then a huge variety of veggies like bean sprouts, celery, onions, green onions, broccoli. potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, green and red peppers, a variety of greens like kale and spinach, mushrooms, and cubes of tofu, at least 3 different kinds of noodles and I probably didn't list them all!  Then comes the sauce station with at least 15-20 different sauces, from hot to spicy to tart to sweet to concentrated beef soup and peanuts.  This same girl helped us decide which sauces to choose, and we ladled them into a small metal bowl.  Last stop in the line was where the cooking grills were, some 5 to 6 feet wide and a chef with a 4 foot spatula mixed and tossed the contents of your bowl plus the liquid sauces creating steam and frying sounds, quite exciting I must say!  You get to go through this line only once.  Next station has unlimited trips and had fried chips, 2 kinds of soup, 3 kinds of rice, and several concentrated sauces like sweet and sour.  At this point you have a gigantic steaming bowl of food which had been transferred to a very large black plastic bowl plus a few little cups of concentrated sauce, and a cup of rice and a cup of soup!.  There were 5 kinds of tea plus the usual soft drinks next in line. At this point you begin shaking due to your low blood sugar level and enchanted experience and fragrances, plus the shear number of vessels and their combined weight!  Oh, did I mention the soft serve ice creams, with cups or cones?   The meal tasted only as good as the chosen ingredients.  I believe you would have to come several times before you get a great combination, hence the possibility of you not returning, as was my thought.  For me it was a nice one time experience.  I would rather use a menu, and let them do \"the heavy lifting\". The lovely woman we met at the front door continued to help us, with a smile, a good bye greeting and even held the door open for us!!!  I wish I knew her name.",

    "text": "Whew it's been a hot minute since I've been to YC's. I was in the area and had some time to kill before meeting a friend for tea so I stopped in. The entrance was a bit backed up with how many people were in line, but it moved quickly and the woman working at the register was quick and efficient at ringing up orders. Then manager was also great about going around and making sure everyone was doing well and ringing up customers too.  I got a small dinner bowl, which also includes a drink, soup, rice, and froyo. I tried to master the art of piling high into my bowl and think I did an okay job. I got Alaskan cod and tofu for my proteins and added veggies, different noodles, and one of their sauce creations from their menu. If I would've read the menu more clearly, I would've added shrimp and an egg (additional costs). Before your food goes on the grill, the cooks scrape it off and add fresh oil. I added raw peanuts on top for a nice crunch. Everything was hot and delicious but unfortunately I was strapped for time so I bought a to-go box for $.50. Leftover YC's isn't as tasty so I recommend eating as much as you can while it's fresh. And I also wouldn't get the red potatoes or cod again, they didn't jive with the rest of the ingredients.   All in all, I'm glad I came back here and it's good to see that they still offer a healthy serving of food for a decent price, unlike another Mongolian grill chain. No hate, but you gotta stay loyal to the OG.",

Once inside, you are met with a charming, buffet-styled line of meats/fish, veggies, and sauce followed immediately by two large grills where your food is cooked in front of you. Portion sizes are as big or small as you make them, but YC's encourages \"packing\" your bowl to maximize value.  If you're a YC's virgin, feel free to follow one of the sauce recipes written in chalk above the grilling area. They are well-proportioned and achieve the intended style. But make no mistake: improvising with various combinations and proportions on your own is what YC's is all about. You are not here to order food; you are here to design it.   If you are visiting the East Valley and want a unique, hands-on dining experience, YC's Mongolian Grill is a fun and challenging option. It does one thing, and it does it well! Two minor complaints: there is no option to buy a small bowl during dinner hours; and, take-out bags cost an additional $0.50.",

The girls working the register had better customer service than some 5 star restaurants I have been to!

    "text": "This place is GREAT. I already left Tempe to go back to California, this was my last meal. When I do come back, I am definitely gonna come visit this place. I basically paid $9.50 for two meals! Though I was gonna board an airplane so I didn't wanna take any to go, so I finished it all :].  At first I was feeling a little uncomfortable, not really sure how to work this thing. It was my first time having this style of cuisine where I add my own ingredients. I read up on some reviews first and tried to get a glimpse of it, but watching those around me also helped. The wax paper is there for you to pack your ingredients in and make your money's worth. Great ingredients, fresh and healthy, then at the end you pick wheat noodles and/or rice noodles, I got both, and then you add a combination of any of the sauces you like. My bowl was towering 4 inches over the top with noodles, but some people were obviously even better at it with a bigger pile of noodles. There were a lot of yummy sounding sauces.. But I picked Spicy thai and thai peanut curry, mainly because those were the closest to me and were the least full (meaning someone had to have taken a lot, right?). I only got like 4.5 spoons of sauce, I definitely should have had more, maybe 7, it was pretty dry and I didn't have a pool of sauce at the bottom of my bowl like my brother did.   Keep waiting in line, and then when the chef calls you up, you just present your tray to them and they'll throw it on and cook it. There were also pineapple slices, peanuts, jalapenos, and such, but like i said, it was my first time and I get a bit uncomfortable at serve your self places, because I'm not entirely sure what I'm entitled to. Takes a quick 1-3 minutes to cook all your stuff, grab a table, or add some stuff to your tray.  They have self serve (all you can eat) brown or white rice, 2 choices of soup, which were pretty good, and some tortillas to add to your dish, which was a delightful addition. Also included in your $9.50 is a cup for soda/juice/tea, they even have blue powerade! My favorite, since I don't drink soda :). No tax so just throw a $10 at the host and you're good to go!. You can also tip the cooks if you'd like. Some people upgrade to the large, create a HUGE BOWL, and just take some to go. If you ask for it to go, the chef can easily fit a \"small\" into two chinese take out boxes. Imagine what a large could be fitted in.   The meal was DELICIOUS, I was STUFFED, however the brown rice could have been a little better, but other than that, I love this place and I can't wait to come back. Healthy eat for sure!",

Instead of yelling at you for piling on too many meat (or veggies if that's your thang), this place ENCOURAGES it! Yeah! Plus, you can opt for one massive bowl or if you're a crazy big eater, you can opt for unlimited bowls. YC must stand for \"You Crazzzzzzzy\" if you eat that much. Only downside here is that all the sauces kind of taste the same after a while.  If that's not enough for your stomach to explode, there's endless soup, chips, rice, drinks, and frozen yogurt for you to gorge on.

Here's how the unique process works; 1. Pick either a small or large bowl. The large bowl is only $1 more, but the small bowl is usually more than enough food if packed correctly.  2. Pack your bowl with a selection of raw and frozen meat. You can choose any combination of turkey, chicken, beef, and pork.  3. Cover your frozen meat with wax paper, and smash it down to create space for the remaining ingredients.  4. Pack the remainder of your bowl with fresh vegetables and noodles. Make sure to smash the ingredients as you go to create more space.  5. Create your own sauce to top off the bowl. They have a chalk board with sauce recipes to guide you in making the perfect concoction.  6. Hand your bowl over to one of the chefs and watch them cook it in front of you.   7. Head on over to their rice and condiment bar.  8. Soft drinks are included in the price of your bowl.  At night time they have a frozen yogurt bar that is also included in the price of your bowl.  Great food, unique experience, and a good value gives YC's an above average rating of four stars.",

Compared to Genghis, you will get way bigger portions which is definitely a plus. Also, they offer rice and other things for sides in addition to your bowl. I don't know if I just don't get the right sauce or what... I like things saucy. Whether it be wings or anything really that requires sauce. It needs to be super saucy. This applies to my stir fry. Whenever I use their sauces, it seems that the sauce is super thin and just not as tasty as Genghis. :( It is possible that I just haven't put the right ingredients together, though. Maybe someday I'll try it one more time to see if I get it right.",

Imagine a salad bar but with raw Asian food ingredient with  cook at the end. One big pro about this style is that you can get just what you want. I for example do not eat meat. YC's allows me to cram as many veggies, noodles and tofu into a bowl as humanly possible. For me it has become a game, how many bowls can I fill post cooking. My current record is three. I can give you bowl construction tips if you would like. If it is not in the bowl it will not be cooked.  The sauces play a big role in the flavor of your meal. If you ask they will let you take a separate bowl for sauce and even help you mix. I like to make my own with generous amounts of garlic and hunan sauce. If you do like garlic like I do be sure to ladle garlic from the bottom of the container as that is where the real pieces are.   After you leave the cooking line you can augment your food with fried won ton strips, spicy oils, mustard's, peanuts, fresh cilantro, sesame seeds, pineapple and more. There also is a station with rice and soups for those who require more than just a bowl of Asian goodness. Soda is included with the meal price and for dinner so is access to the frozen yogurt machine.   If you can not finish your meal they will gladly sell you to go boxes at .50 a piece.    The one thing that confuses me is the name, Mongolians are a nomadic people, yet their BBQ grills are huge I don't see how that would work.",

I only wish that there was a way to make your sauce a little saucier. The wok looks scalding hot and they have to add water to your food to prevent from burning, this makes stir-fry flavorful but a bit dry (not enough sauce for my taste). Everybody that works there is super helpful and friendly, too.",

I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.  I was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?  I guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-(",

First off, love the concept. You get a bowl and you can pile it high with various meats, veggies, noodles, and rice. You pick a sauce and then hand everything over to one of the chefs who cooks it right there in front of you. You also get a soup, won tons, and a drink, all for $11-12. It's a good deal. I usually grab some brown rice, white meat chicken, a ton of veggies, and top it with some curry sauce for a very healthy, satisfying meal.  The cashiers and chefs are always extremely friendly. The first time I was in, two servers walked me through the whole process. Just very nice people and it's always consistent every time I go.  Overall, kudos to the owners as they really know how to run a business. I've also been to the Elliot Road location and it's the exact same experience.",

I yelped here and there and noticed this place has extensive reviews. 4 stars with lots of reviews is hard to come by now days.   We walk in and we bypass the register so the lady immediately followed us and asked if it were our first time (clearly).  They have an option of bowls but there is only a dollar difference between small and large (we went with large).   You start by selecting the food you want from a small bar with numerous amounts of meats and vegetables. After that you get to pick your own seasonings that'll highlight your dish. The person at the register helps you with all of these options and is really helpful. After all your desires have been chosen you get to see the cook, cook your meal in front of you.   Along with the meal you get to pick up rice and soup with a drink (if you have gotten the meal). Which is a pretty sweet deal. After  our meal (which we didn't finish) we asked for to-go boxes which you have to pay fifty cents extra but with this being our first time she let us have them for free.   Overall experience was amazing. We definitely will be coming back but with empty stomachs. ;)",

My food always comes out amazing and the cherry on top is that even though it's not a full sit down restaurant, the hostess still checks on you to make sure your meal is fine.  **just something to mention: the cost for a doggy bag last time I was in was a mere $.50 plus tax and to pay that to have a great lunch the next day is so worth it for sure.",

This is a place where you get a bowl to add all the raw items you want to have cooked on a very large flat stone surface. Then you add sauces for from a large variety to a separate bowl to add to your raw items when cooked. They have suggestions but you don't have to follow this. I created my own and I was sure to dip my finger in my sauce bowl to check the state. Be sure to do this as the sauce needs to be pretty strong because a lot of it will be lost when it is cooked on the flat stone. My wife failed to do this and hers turned out to be not very flavorful. Overall it was good for me and I would come back. It would be especially good for gluten free eating or low carb as everything is clearly marked GF or not and most of the items are low carb.",

Patrons were much more well behaved than last time and the service was more friendly than I remember as well.  I LOVE Mongolian food but unfortunately any time I crave it I have to treck from the West side of town to the land of great Mongolian restaurants, which is the East Valley.    Normally, I go to the location on the 101 and Indian Bend, but my fiance and I decided that we liked this location much better after our visit as it has a more laid back calmer atmosphere.  Everything was clean and organized.  I avoided the fish altogether this time, and opted for steak/chicken.  The veggie variety was amazing and they have sriracha available as well.  Sriracha is my new found LOVE, and any place that offers it, is A-OK with me.  All in all, I will definitely return, and thank the manager for making me a believer and a HUGE fan of this location of YC's Mongolian Grill.",

There are also usually two soups of the day to choose from, made with the previous night's leftovers it looks like.  They also have dessert in the form of soft serve!  For those that don't trust their own sauce-making skills, there are helpful recipes on the board above you for you to choose from.    Their dinner used to be all-you-can-eat at one price, but now they have a single bowl price and an all-you-can eat price.  Generally, I can only eat one bowl, so I usually go for the single trip!

The grill/cook catered to requests and offered tips that helped make the experience better than my last.  I came to this YC's , as I had a bad experience at another location on two occasions. The grill specialist did not water down my bowl ( he added my oils/sauces AFTER water was applied to the grill).  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT as it preserves the quality and taste of your bowl (make this recommendation when you visit)   Inspect the laddles/spatulas handles before you touch them , as other patrons are not sanitary. This is NOT YC's fault.  This location was constantly walking around, cleaning and stocking items.   TIP:  Place your oils/sauces in a SEPARATE BOWL.  Don't let the cook at the grill add a lot of water to your food .  Request that the water is added BEFORE adding your oils/sauces.   The overall experience was enjoyable and I would recommend the YC's chain again. Thank you to the owners/management for correcting a previous experience.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of YC's Mongolian BBQ and usually go to the Chandler/Gilbert locations. My husband and our two kids came here on Father's day 2016 due to the proximity to where we were shopping at the time. I immediately noticed that this building was in serious need of some work. The back section looked like it was falling apart and frankly, was pretty gross to look out the dingy faded windows. The customer service was very poor, employees looked like they didn't want to be there, nobody was pleasant, and it was contagious. Usually when I go to the other locations I can taste the flavor of the sauce that I made in my food, in this case, all of our food tasted the same, regardless of which sauce recipe we used. It was a pretty depressing experience and I do not plan on going back to this location.",

    "text": "Solid Mongolian grill.  Pretty standard.  Get your bowl, pack it with meat, veggies and noodles then make a sauce from one of the recipes on the board or go kamikaze and create your own sauce.  I always try the latter option hoping to discover some amazing combination that hasn't been thought of.  It seems pretty hard to mess it up though.  Depending on what you choose its going to come out one of 2 ways.. spicy or not spicy.  I don't really like being forced to buy a drink with the bowl price, but overall a good lunch.",

The ignorant, un-enthused staff member did not fully explain the choices available as she handed us dingy steel bowls, and charged about $12.00 a person for them. . I also was WAY NOT COOL with what seemed like gallons of water being added to my meal as it was cooked on the grill, ultimately creating a disgusting soupy mess of a dinner.  I was not interested in finishing my meal, and HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR A TO-GO CONTAINER AND A BAG.  Finally, when it comes to the soup... Do not, for your life, eat this trash. It's days old meats and veggie bits... So rancid. So gross. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to focus on the positive aspects of my dining experiences, but unfortunately the negatives at YC's Mongolian Grill were many.  I highly suggest NOT eating here.",

That's a waste of business, closing a half an hour before actual closing time? Really guys?? I had to go to subway, I guess it's good business for subway:p    Maybe complaining to the manager might be good, I LOVE THIS PLACE, but why close at 8:30pm when the sign says 9:00pm?   The food is great and all I've been coming here for the past 2years, but my one star goes to closing WAAAYYYYYY to early.  What a disappointment!  What's the point of going after work for dinner if it closes WAY before closing time?:(  Thanks for not wanting to attend me, I'll be choosing other places to eat.  It would of been 5 stars:(",

There is a staff member (server? not sure what to call her) named Janet that is just so helpful. While you're in line making your bowl, she'll ask you if you'd like a sauce prepared, she'll recommend sauces for your taste, etc.  She helps you bring things to your table, and checks in on you during the meal. Awesome service!",

    "text": "If you know how to cook, you should have a good time at YC's. Your meal is basically what you make of it, and although the bowl may be on the medium side, you will shortly find that this makes for a huge meal. I could not even finish mine and had leftovers to take home. They encourage you to pile it as high as you can get it, then I added two bowls of sauce, one spicy and one Mongolian and it came out great. Perfectly sauced, and not thin and soupy like some have stated.   The only thing I didn't really like was the frozen fish, it just did not work well with the stir fry. Bonus if you are tired of take-out consisting of mostly bell pepper pieces and not enough meat, you can make your whole bowl consist of meat, sauce, and rice! (Not that I condone such behaviour).  I thought the ice cream was going to be an icy afterthought like most buffets, but it was actually pretty good so I had two like a big pig. I wouldn't call it gourmet but I would call it decent takeout quality.",
