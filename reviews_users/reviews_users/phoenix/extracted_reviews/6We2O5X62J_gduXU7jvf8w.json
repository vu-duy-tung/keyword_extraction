This is my third or fourth taste of heaven, as we often order pizza for our office crew, and each time it has been fantastic!  Granted, I stick with the plain old pepperoni or sausage pizza, so others may not be as tasty.  Doesn't matter 'cause I LOVE it!",

This is the first time I have been to this new location and it is just as good as the others with a really nice decor and great service.  We always get the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza, and it's always good.  Also, we always start with the garlic cheese bread, seriously the best I have had anywhere!  The sauce on their pizza is different, a little sweet, but I love it.  If you are looking for good pizza in Phoenix, this would be not only my top, but my only recommendation!",

The food was as delicious as always but  I really wanted to acknowledge the great service that we received from the crew,  Todd and Brandon (the men in charge of catering) the hostess ( regretfully I have forgotten her name) and Matt were very friendly and professional.  A special Thank you goes to our server Bobby, he was incredible, he took care of 30 people and stayed on top of everything with a friendly smile and a great personality. He really made this occasion perfect.  I highly recommend Spinato's if you want to have an exceptional experience. They treated us all like we were their family. Make sure that you request Bobby to provide the perfect service for your special event.",

Ordered a drink and let the bartender know I wanted to place a to go order.  He said great and went to the POS system to set the order up, he came half way back and asked for the order. I gave him a simple first pizza order, half with olives half with none and add sausage. He keys it in and then goes and starts talking to another customer, then served another. Big problem, I had 2 other pizzas and a salad to order. This place is the last place to visit on a Friday or Saturday evening. They are too busy to show simple respect to customers who are willing to pay their over inflated prices for a sweet style pizza. I talked to the manager who listened and wanted to comp something. They just don't get it, but they try. Avoid this place when it's busy, simple as that.",

It took her over 10 minutes to acknowledge us & to take our drink orders. We were almost done with our meal before she even bothered to check on us.

She was very accommodating with our requests for sides of dressing, lemons and extra marinara. She even took the onions off a sandwich because the side salad was ordered without onions. The food was great; I went with the signature calzone, YUM! Everyone really enjoyed their food. Our servers brought extra plates and forks for our shower cake and even offered to wrap up the extra cake for us to take back! I wish I remember her name to give her kudos. She went above and beyond to accommodate and make our experience the best possible. We will be back for sure.",

It was extremely loud, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  Do not go here expecting authentic Italian food.  Its fast food italian quality at best, much like Fazolis was.    We waited an hour for our food and the server forgot to put in our order for our appetizer which was garlic breadsticks.  The Manager came over and tried to give me a free dessert for the mixup.  I passed on the dessert, I wanted breadsticks before my meal not a dessert after.  Also, the food quality is poor.  My meal came with a greek salad.  The only thing greek about the salad was the feta cheese.   Greek salad shouldnt come with italian dressing.    I have had thier pizzas and they are good.  Anything else on the menu is mediocre.  I would order thier pizza as take out and skip the insanely loud and slow dining experience.",

Place is very clean. Service is excellent. Now for the nitty gritty. Ordered the meatball trio and garlic bread with mozzarella cheese on top. Both were pretty dammmmmmmm guuuuuuuuuud, I must say. I'm a sucka for meatballs n sausage n this place delivers on the meatballs lol.   Ordered the \"got meat\" thin crust pizza. Pizza came out great !!! However, too much meat on my thin crust pizza that it kinda weighed it down, but u know wat, who the buck cares lol. Pizza tasted great !!! The marinara sauce is a bit in the sweet side which I'm not used to but overall it was a good pizza.   Actually ordered a shietload of food that I cannot finish. But u know wat, I had to try a bit of as much as I could to write this review for u guys n gals.   All in all, pizza not as good as Grimaldi's (IMO) but they definitely hold their own. I would definitely return for the food, customer service, atmosphere anddddddddddddddddd I ran out of ideas LOL !!!!!! So come on by if you're in the area.",

The sad thing was the cashier did a double take to make sure everything was there but forgot something important.  I take part of the blame since I should have looked it over.  My advise if you do take out is to open everything",

The service was great, as well as the ambience, but what impressed me the most were all of the gluten free options. I have been gluten free for over 10 years, and this was the first time I had been in an Italian restaurant with gluten free bread!!!  I ended up ordering the baked artichoke crostini appetizer, and it was incredible. Way too much food for one person, so I boxed it up and ended up eating my left over for dinner.   My only complaint is that they do not offer a gf pizza crust option, nor do they offer gf pasta.",

    "text": "I love this place, and even more so, this exact location.  There are so many things I enjoy about this place, I am a little torn on where to start.  Quickly I will give a recommended first trip order, and then give details about what I love about this place:  Drink (Any Arizona Stronghold wine, I really like their reds - Dala specificly)  App (Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either, and then I tasted it WOW!)  Pizza (thin crust Spicy Italian (w/ Jalepanos) or (The Combo).  Dessert - (Pistachio Gelato)  Ok, start from the outside, work my way inside, and work from apps and drinks through dessert.  Outside:  GORGEOUS, one story brick building on Chandler Blvd between 48th and 50th Street (just west of the I-10 exit).  The parking lot is very crowded during the busier times (evenings, especially Friday and Saturday).    Inside: Once you are inside the building, there isn't a large waiting area, and once you get your seats, you will see why.  They maximum the space in the building for those sitting and enjoying their food/drinks.  Even in the areas where there are more tables (eastside of the building), it never feels too crowded to me.  The westside of the building is the bar, and smaller tables with really nice, fabric-covered seats (fancy). :)  Staff:  The hostesses, to the waitstaff, to the managers (who my wife and I met while dinning on a less busy Saturday afternoon) are fantastic at customer service.  I can't think of a single time we have been that we haven't really enjoyed ourselves, and part of that can be attributed to the wonderful people who wait on us.  Drinks:  Very good wine selection (whites and reds) and they do a respectable job making sure to work in good, quality local winieries (Arizona Stronghold and Pilsbury come to mind).  My only (slight) complaint, is I would like to see a wider craft beer selection (especially as many local brewers as possible, Four Peaks, Sun Up, to name a few).  Food: OMG! This food is always fantastic.  My wife and I always get the meatball trio in vodka sauce.  These are the most moist and flavorful meatballs I have eaten, and that doesn't even include the vodka sauce and cheese in which the meatballs are cooked.    Pizzas - Haven't had a bad one yet; the only one's I am not as in love with are any of the one's that come with spinich (I think because I don't love cooked spinich, not because they aren't doing something right).  Sandwiches - Haven't had one, so no opinion (although the ones to pass my table smelled great! :) ).  Pasta - My wife had the special, which was a seafood and pasta dish  which had scallops (cooked perfectly), baby clams, and shrimp (so tender) in a wonderful tomato sauce.  I don't like clams, but this all blended so nicely where no parts of the seafood or pasta, or sauce over-powered one another.  Dessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli (and this place does), I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it.  Until our last trip, when the waiter (playfully) made us order the gelato (Pistachio).  We are so glad he did!  We loved it!  With a large selection of food options, there is something for everone!",

    "text": "Notes from Spinato's:  Meatball Trio - Even though the name of this appetizer suggests three different types of meatballs...it's just three meatballs. Nevertheless, get this! So good! We got the sauce on the side so we could try both options. Both sauces were good, but we liked the marinara the best.  Greek Salad - Wow, amazing! The dressing on this salad can't be beat...not even at a Greek restaurant.  Pizza - Meh. The crust wasn't bad (we got the thin), and the cheese was amazing, but the sauce was WAY too sweet. Tasted like ketchup (yuck!). Still, as bad as the sauce was, the crust and cheese made it edible. I think next time I'll try the Margherita Pizza and get a side of Marinara to dip the crust in.  Classic Submarine Sandwich - Pretty good. The insides were delicious, but the bread really took away from the flavor. The bread was a dry, flavorless, airy sub sandwich roll, not a fresh-baked baguette. Unfortunate too, because between the lifeless bread and the too-sweet pizza sauce, they lost a full star on what could have been a 5-star rating.  Overall, I really enjoyed Spinatos. The staff was great. The atmosphere was very nice. The food was mostly delicious. I will most certainly be back.",

However, the only thing that remains is the pizza, and that's it. The service is now awful. I went there with my family, and we were told 20-25 minutes. Nope. We were seated... 1 hour and 15 minutes later! We sat down and it took another 15 minutes for us to meet our waiter, and she didn't even introduce herself. In fact, we had to ask the servers at the front what her name was. I know it was busy, but she was only waiting us and one other table. She asked us what our drinks were with a look on her face that she did not want to be there. There was no \"Hi, how are you doing? What would you like to drink?\" It was just, \" what do you want.\" No clarity or anything. After a lengthy amount of time she brought our drinks... Well most of them. She forgot 3 of them. We had to tell her she forgot some and then she brought again some of them. It took me asking 3 times and 45 minutes to get a simple glass of water. She later came and took our order, still with an angered face. She then put in our order. Well most of our order. She forgot my sisters order. She said \"the kitchen forgot to make it.\" This was unTrue, because of the receipt it said \"on the fly\" meaning she forgot to input the order. When it finally came out after we were all done eating, she said \"here.\" With an angry tone and dropped the pizza on the table while nearing hitting my sisters head with it. The only good part of the experience was the food and the staff up front (even though it took awhile it wasn't their fault). I have gone there 3 times this year. Hoping it would be better. It wasn't. This is compared to the like thirty times last year.   TL;DR (Too long; didn't read) The service sucked, pizza was good. All in all, bring back Bobby Carzoo. He was what made this place amazing. Sorry to say, but this place needs to make some changes.",

It was way different from the apple cobble we have had in the past, super dry, not tasty and overall just bad.  Our waiter to top it off was a dud.  The rest of the staff was excellent and helped more than our waiter himself.  It wasn't until he brought the dessert that he asked if we needed more drinks, rarely came to our table and was annoyed when he had to clean up a spill on the floor that I had already started to clean up myself.",

    "text": "I'm a little familiar with Spinato's as I've visited their Tempe location a few times. Pizza has always been great, so when Spinato's opened in Ahwatukee I couldn't wait to visit and try some of their other items.   I was pretty underwhelmed by the whole experience. Italian bread is $1.99 for something that really should be complimentary. I guess this is a sign of the times, though, so I wouldn't hold that against them if the bread was tasty. But unfortunately, it was nothing special, so please don't waste your money. There was zero flavor and nothing \"Italian\" about it.  I personally had basic spaghetti with marinara sauce. The sauce was good, but the portion was small for the price ($7.49). Again, not very surprising. What I was surprised about was the amount of time two simple plates of spaghetti took to come out. I'm usually not one to compare the speed of my food to others in the restaurant, because I know food takes different times to prepare and all, but I have do it this time. While we were waiting I had time to observe a table of five that were ordering at the table next to us. They spent quite some time giving all of their picky special requests, yet they still received their food before us. All of that before two simple plates of spaghetti?  I was very disappointed with the service we received. There were employees everywhere, and everyone was very pleasant, but I do feel like our server ignored us to pay more attention to the table next to us. I don't think it was a coincidence that this other table had four servings of alcohol. I guess he didn't want to waste time on us when he thought he'd be getting a bigger tip from them. Again, while waiting for our food I had time to look around and I saw another one of his tables (also without alcohol) being ignored as well. The only time he seemed to make us a priority was when a manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  Then he rushed right over to clear our plates and ask if we needed dessert.   I'll still give them another shot and pick up a pizza in the future, but I'll stay away from dining in.",

But I went to take my son, and because my best friend said it was great. When we got their the place was packed but no wait. (By the time we left they were lining up at the door)  As soon as we sat down our server got our drink order, and finding out it was out first time gave us some history of the place. I really enjoyed that.  We started off with their cheesy garlic bread with sauce on the side. My son who states hates garlic bread loved this, even stating he'd come back here just for that.  We followed up with each of is getting a personal pizza, mine was their \"Get Meaty\", my son had a pepperoni & pineapple, both on their version of thin crust. For the personal ones, to me this seems like standard hand tossed crust and it was divine.  We each ate half and brought the rest home. Totally stuffed!  With our two drinks, he a soda, me a tea, our bill was just over 20 bucks. Well worth it in my mind. Our glasses were never empty, never did plates lay around on our table but we also never felt rushed or bothered.  My new favorite place to eat near my house, as we walked out I got a glance at the pasta dished, I think they might be next on my list to try.  Another bonus, they not only have take out, they deliver!",

I have three thoughts: - The pizza is good.  - The pizza is overpriced. - The service is craptastic. The first time they made me the wrong pizza and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes after everyone else had received their food. No discount was given on my order. The third time I called an order in and they told me it would 30-35 minutes. My wait was actually 57 minutes. When I complained the takeout person just looked at me with a blank stare. No apology, no discount.  The service is so bad it is enough to send me elsewhere, like Grimaldi's, if I am going to spend that kind of money on pizza.",

It's not quite at Pizano's level, but it beats flying back to Chicago for pizza, and it's really close, the closest I've ever had. If you love Pizano's, make a beeline to this establishment and get the thin crust, amazing.",

The server (Clint) was super friendly and did a superb job.  The manager (Matt) came out to check on us a well.  Overall it was a very nice dining experience and very reasonably priced.  The bar area is a much better ambience than the restaurant so ask for a table there.  Would highly recommend!",

    "text": "I have never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant before. Firstly, my friends and I wanted to go here because we love the pizza and have had glowing experiences before this. Once we arrive and are seated, our server completely disregarded us and expressed rude remarks towards our group. Once we order our food, It took over 40 minutes to bring us our dishes. Our server, Clint, did not talk to us at all and we could not get a refill to save our lives. Once we finish our food and get our checks (FINALLY!!) after waiting for enormous lengths of time, we find out that they charged us extra for ranch dressing. Now, we don't have a problem with the extra charge, but what proceeded to happen disgusted us. When we ask the server about the extra charge, he says \"You should expect to pay for things at a restaurant\" in a very rude and condescending way. We proceed to argue with our server, who had been absent all night, and he continued with the rude remarks. So after all the arguing, we ask him to get a manager. He then proceeds to go over to the drink station and starts laughing at us with another guy. We then find out that the guy he was laughing at us WAS THE MANAGER. The manager, Michael, came over and was sarcastic and rude towards us also. We left after an extremely frustrating night with some of the worst service we have ever experienced.  But the stories not over yet. We call the general manager expressing our anger and offers a free meal on him, which we found to be very kind. We are all for second chances, and free food, so we decide to return. When we come back, the GM was very kind to us and welcomed us. So we go through the whole service and had a great time. Our server, Cole, was very kind and attentive. We thought our whole meal would be payed for but they only gave us half off. We understand there may have been miscommunication and went back to the manager to talk. Unfortunately, the manager at that time was Michael. He was extremely rude to us again. He would not give us the discount that we had agreed upon, and kept saying sarcastic remarks. I've never seen a manager of an establishment be so blatantly rude. After much arguing, he finally gave us our agreed upon discount.   Overall: Cole and Kirsten, we're both extremely helpful and kind towards us. The general manager Brian Stover, was also kind and attentive.  Clint, our first server, was dreadful and rude.  Finally, I've saved the worst for last. Michael created the worst restaurant experience I've had in my entire life. He was rude, and had no idea what he was doing. He should not be allowed on the front of house, let alone be a manager. Spinatos will not be a successful organization if they're hiring terrible people like him.",

Our waiter was in a bad mood and he did not seem friendly at all. Once we got our food we had asked for some ranch so he gave us four ranches later on finding out that they charge for each ranch we get and he didn't even let us know it would have been up-charge. It took him nearly 30 minutes for him to check up on how we were doing and all of our drinks were empty and we were asking for refills because he didn't bother to check up at all. Once we got the tab he told us we couldn't split the bill and I knew that was a lie because you can always split any bill. We saw that the ranch was charged on their and when we spoke to him about it he told us \"well if you're going to go to restaurant you're going to need to spend money\" it was a rude remark and it wasn't necessary at all. We asked to speak to a manager and once our waiter left we could see him laughing and talking with his other co workers. The manager finally came and wasn't very helpful either he heard us out an but didn't do much after that in fact he made matters worse. Brining our checks back but charging them both on the wrong cards. We were all so upset and I'm not going back there again.",

When you do take-out/delivery there is this corn meal stuff on the bottom of the pizza that I absolutely love. What do you order? Like I said, you need something where you get the sweet tomato sauce. I have learned to get the $10 small pizza during happy hour so I can customize my own with homemade Italian sausage and pepperoni. So delicious! I don't need all these overly creative specialty pizzas. Do not order the Roasted Fennel & Italian Sausage. It is god-awful.",

I've been here at least 20 times, but I usually can only bring myself to order just a standard pepperoni pizza or the Mamma's Signature pizza (spinach,garlic, and cheese) because they are that good. Eventually I'll have enough courage to branch out and try something new on the menu.    The only disappointment I've ever experienced was when I ordered the margherita pizza a few months ago. Everything else is perfect. Also of note -- Spinato's is a little pricier than average, but totally worth it.",

Sadly, this was not the case last night. We ordered garlic bread as an appetizer that never came out. Our waiter never came back to check on us in between the time we placed our order and the food arriving, which took over 40 minutes, our calzones were cold on the inside like they had been sitting out of the oven for quite some time and the majority of mushrooms inside them were still half raw... we have come here over a dozen times and every single time ordered the same calzones. They've always been too hot to even cut into immediately and steam just barrels out when we take our first bite. This time it was the complete opposite. So disappointed and probably won't be coming back.",

Although I learned after the first time they put too much garlic on it for my taste so now I tell them easy on the garlic and it is perfection.  The sauce is so yummy and sweet.  The crust is thin and crispy.  Where they are lacking in is their appetizers.  This is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  The appetizer portions are small and overpriced for how much you get, which makes me sad.  The caprese \"salad\" is tiny and is missing something, I can't recal now.  And the Bruschetta is just weird.  I would love to see them step up this part of the menu.  I usually love caprese salad and bruschetta but I don't order it here.  It would be nice to enjoy one of those before the pizza.  The decor and ambiance is nice.  Haven't tried any desserts because I'm so full from the pizza.

    "text": "As much as I hate to do it, I have to amend my original review and take a way a couple of stars from Spinato's.  I am very upset to learn that I have been mis-informed several times by their managers about certain items on the menu being gluten free.  Originally, I was told by their manager that all bone-in wings were gluten free because they had their own dedicated fryer.  Shortly after that, a delivery guy informed us my favorite wings, the spicey chili, were not gluten free.  The manager I spoke to about that informed me only certain sauces were gluten free, mild, medium and hot.  I ordered some pizza and wings this past weekend.  I was called & informed that none of their wings have ever been gluten free, that they have never had a dedicated fryer.  Shame on Spinato's for mis-informing me on several occasions and jeopardizing my health, and anyone else's with an allergy, in the process.  Some things I was told were completely False.  I immediately attempted to contact their corporate office about this & asked them to consider re-training for their staff and managers.  I have not received any response or apology from them.  I am removing them from my gluten free favorites list and will be giving it some serious thought as to whether or not I want to order from them in the future.",

    "text": "I came here for take out on a Monday at lunch and was helped by a wonderful hostess who after talking to me about some vegetarian menu items, directed me to the take out area which is a great idea! It has a separate door so you can quickly pick up your take out. Very nice and helpful staff :)  After so many of my friends raved about Spinato's food, I was not as easily swayed. I ordered the Mama's Spinach Pizza which was said to be their best seller. It had everything I love. My first impression was SUPER SALTY. Next I was overwhelmed with roasted garlic, like a garlic truck ran me over.  Don't get me wrong, I love garlic but it was called a spinach pizza and I did not taste any spinach although it was covered in it. I also didn't care for the overly sweet sauce. It wasn't disgusting or anything just not my favorite. Something about the sweetness of garlic when it is roasted and the sweet sauce = too much sweet  and didn't mesh well to me. I really want to give this place another star so I am looking forward to coming back and trying a different pizza. Maybe the Mama's Spinach one was just not for me. I will update my review when I do.  If I were to make one suggestion it would be to LAY OFF THE SALT!  That's what salt shakers are for. If we want salt we will put it on ourselves.",

    "text": "Sorry Leo. I had to update my review. So this is the second time I have been to this location. The last time was over a year ago. The first time didn't go well but I gave them another shot. The first time the service sucked. I chalked it up to the server maybe just having a bad day. Over the weekend we tried to eat here again. Well this time the service was ok. Just ok. Nothing special. The server didn't really seem too happy to be serving us. I'm pretty picky about service because my fiance and I seem to get a long really well and have a friendship with the employees of the restaurants we frequent the most. The server wasn't too friendly and made us feel like we inconvenienced him by asking for a tiny loaf of bread to go ten minutes before they close. So what. It's bread. Deal with it. Anyways onto the food. I got pizza and I would say their pizza is pretty unique. The sauce stood out which is rare for a pizza place. Even after eating the leftovers the next day I couldn't decide if I like the sauce being so sweet or if it handicaps the pizza. Overall though the pizza was really delicious and I tore it up. The house bread with butter is a good starter.  The restaurant is nice. Some of the other employees around were friendly just not our server so much. I will go back again though in hopes that we finally find a server who is friendly because the food is good enough to make me want to go back. Minus 1 star for the service.",

We got the meatballs for an appetizer and those were delicious as well. I also just found out that they have take and bake!  You can get a pie to take home either uncooked or 3/4 cooked.

They had an excellent children's menu that came with a gelato after which kept our children happy. They even gave us a toddler t-shirt for them both, it was really nice!

More like a secret pizza establishment that only the lucky few knew of...yet the line was always out the door around lunch time. Now year's later, I work right down the street from the Ahwatukee location and STILL remain a loyal, faithful customer who is convinced that you just can't order anything like it anywhere else. My first experience was the famous spinach pizza. I can honestly tell you, I had never eaten spinach before and had I not tried that slice, I may never have! Today I like to try different pizzas as well as their other dishes too. Tonight I ordered the Nicole's favorite but I get it with ricotta instead of feta cheese. Oh mah gah! So amazing! Calzones are huge and so soft and fresh. Salads are perfect. I can't think of anything this place can't make right! If you are looking for something south of Bianco and with a twist, check it out. It's even worth a drive I'd say.There's a reason their spinach pizza is \"famous\". Oh. Don't skip the chocolate chip cookies on your way out. Trust me on this.",

Let me tell you something: this is both a pretty good pizza joint, and not a bad Italian joint in general!  First off, they have a sandwich which I believe is called the Grilled Da Vinci - it's awesome.  It's enough to fill up even a seriously hungry dude (like myself) and delicious from end to end.  The bread is perfect, the meat is fresh and tender, the italian dressing is fantastic (ask for some extra italian dressing to dip the sandwich into).  Ah!  Mamma Mia!  The pizza is pretty fantastic too.  All of the ingredients, fresh, plentiful - what else do you want?  The atmosphere in here is good.

I ordered the Mama's Signature pizza, cause that what the menu told me to do, and it was not a disappointment.

    "text": "Spinato's just opened in Ahwatukee and you would think it was the first and only restaurant this side of South Mountain from all of the people there.  The place was packed!  However, it was our lucky day when our friends got there just in time to get us a prime spot at a bar table!  There were servers and staff everywhere, so even though the confusion of opening night was obvious, everyone was having a great time and there were plenty of people helping out so it didn't really matter.  We ordered a few appetizers and four personal (7\") pizzas.    The Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome!  Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce (that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust, so ask for a side) for only $3.99!  The BF had the \"Here's the Beef\" pizza which looked meaty and delicious.  I probably would have had a bite, but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings (feta, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, spinach, and tomatoes) that I didn't want anything to mess with the flavors.  Every day is a different daily drink special and $2 PBR all day, every day.  I would say that I can't wait for the place to calm down so I can go back, but to be honest, I don't really care.  I'll go back even if it is just as busy as opening night.  The food was wonderful, the service was great, and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of.    The only bad part about Spinato's opening in the Tuke is going to be deciding which of my favorite pizza joints I'm going to pick on any given night!",

Also tried the Combo and loved it on the thin crust, but  my favorite item on the menu is the trio of meatballs-YUM!  They have the meatball making down pat.  I could go in there and just have the meatballs and bread....if I absolutely had to. The meatballs come in  marinara with hot bubbly cheese melted and just browned.",

We have tried a lot of their items and they are mostly good or ok. The staff is very friendly, we can recognize most of them but they usually don't remember us, which is fine.  The reason we used to come often is because we live within walking distance and it's convenient.   We really like the mama spinach pizza or combo pizza, the salads are good too. There are a few items such some salad dressing, a couple of pizza and a couple  pasta dishes we tried that we did not like at all. We have only stuck to pizzas' then. The thin crust is the one to eat, not the thick one. They only have pepsi products which is fine but we like Coke best.   Their sweet sauce is great. Some items are really good but some taste like from a can. Their canoli was decent for the first 3 times then they started coming either empty (no filing inside) or just tasting like a sweet cheese. So we don't do canoli's anymore but I know they cookies are good.   Their Gluten Free pizza is not very good a bit too expensive. Buon Gusto down the street has the best GF pizza and very reasonably priced.  Some of their staff is not well informed on Gluten free items or items in their menu. It's important for the staff to be knowledgeable when it comes to food allergy and the contents of the menu they work in. I would not trust GF items here as I didn't feel confident that they understand it.    We think ourselves to be good clients as we sometimes eat here on a weekly basis.  But recently, I order a combo pizza with the thick crust (trying first time) and we did not like the crust at all. However, the main problem was that somehow there were two pieces of chicken bones about 2 inches long mixed in with the cheese and other veggies. My husband hurt his mouth with one of the hard chicken bone pieces.   We brought the entire pizza back (minus 2  1/2 slices) and they credited us the pizza and said a manager would call us next day. We never received a call or feedback. We never finished our lunch. We ended up after returning the pizza having to take the family to in-n-out as a fast solution since we had run out of lunch time. Very inconvenient to have to drive back to bring the pizza back and receive a half apology and then have to go find lunch somewhere else.   We haven't eaten there since then. :(   Pomo is the best pizza in Phoenix but way too far for us. So we are still looking for a decent place for our pizza fix.  We just wish spinatos would be less careless for its customers and food they serve.",

After camping for four days with only freeze-dried food to eat, my boyfriend and I were CRAVING some Italian goodness from Spinato's. We dreamed about it for days. Well it happened to be a Monday, and we still got what our little hearts desired, but our exhausted camper selves had to drive for it!   I can barely even eat Papa Johns style of \"fast food\" pizza anymore. I'm becoming a Spinato's snob. Sorry. Not that sorry!

My last experience, I will just hash up to a bad day at the restaurant. Everyone has them, people and businesses, and second chances are in order. I am glad I did.   The food is great, it was the first time and it was exciting to come back to the second time. We love this pizza. My kids love it because they get their own pizza, drink and desert for about $6. Great deal. The quality of these pies are insane. Great crust, the sauce is delicious, toppings are fresh and flavorful. Very happy with the food. Service was outstanding this time. Our waitress was kind and thoughtful and even engaged our 5 year old and asked her what she wanted, great job!   Thank you for having us back Morgan and righting our wrong ideas about Spinato's. Can't wait to come again and again.",

They do hh from 2-6pm and we ordered the following from that menu:  - Baked Artichoke Crostini  - Piccola Wings  - Caesar Salad  - and a couple of beers   While the salad was passable, everything else besides the beer was lackluster. We felt full especially since the food is so heavy, but not in a satisfied way (which is the worst!)   Service was great though and if you are trying to watch any games, they do have a good amount of TVs around the bar area.   The only saving grace was the pizza. We actually ordered a small pizza to-go and did half and half of the Roasted Fennel & Italian Sausage and the Salsiccia Di Pollo. We took it back and tried it a few hours later and it was still yummy despite being cold. Very interesting flavors and toppings that do end up working well together.   Not sure if I would come back though since there are plenty of other pizza places I would prefer to go to. (And I generally like a simple margherita pizza any ways).",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I don't engage in the debate of Chicago deep-dish v. New York slices, thin crust v. Sicilian, etc.  Pizza is just delicious, and when you find a good one, it's not worth splitting hairs to decide which is best - just enjoy what you got.  As for me, having a soft spot for Neopolitan and Chicago-style pizzas, coming here this last trip was my first pizza experience here, though not my first time here.  The dish that gets me going here I'll get to later.  Wife ordered the Mama Spinato's, thin crust.  Brought her here because I told her she HAD to try the sauce.  She has become a believer.  So this is a spinach and tomato pizza, pretty basic.  What makes it so delicious though, apart from the sauce, is the garlic.  Lots of it.  If you're garlic-averse, don't get this pizza, otherwise, wrap your arms around it and embrace.  I think it would do better with the thicker Sicilian crust, but that choice wasn't up to me.  The kick of the garlic, along with the sweet-saltiness of the sauce and the mellowness of the cheese and spinach made for great balance.  A solid pizza.  But here's why I really love this place, apart from the sauce.  It's the dish i get almost every time I come here.  Baked spaghetti calzone.  Carb heaven.  It is, simply, marinara sauced spaghetti baked inside a calzone shell, covered in more sauce.  The noodles come out super al dente from the extra baking and all that sauce brings flavor to the otherwise plain crust you get from the calzone shell.  You can opt to add ricotta, which I tend not to do - it tends to take away from he taste of the sauce.  But if that's what you're looking for, adding ricotta could be a good option for you.  Also have the option of adding sausage.  I also skip this typically.  The couple times I've ordered it before, it is really minimal sausage.  Crumbles, really.  And for the price, it's just not good value.  On a side note, I appreciate their attention to detail.  Both the calzone and thin crust pizza came out on wire racks to keep the crusts crispy.  Bonus points.  So come for the sauce, stay for the baked spaghetti calzone.  The pizza is solid too and if the Mama Spinato is any indication, then your pizza order should be in good hands.",

Don't fall off.   *Slightly* over their quoted delivery time, but what else do you expect on a weekend at dinner?  The girl on the phone was extremely friendly and answered all of our questions and the driver was charismatic as well.  Might start asking for a classic pie cut, however. They cut the pizza into squares which is nice for picking but we prefer the alternative for our dinner.   All in all, good pizza.

We ordered a pizza and it was really good. Lots of toppings and cheese and sauce and cooked to perfection! For dessert we shared a canollo (yes the Italian in me wants to use the proper term! lol. One conollo, two canolli!) Ok, I digress! The server found out it was a birthday and wrote on the plate in chocolate Happy Birthday and took the dessert off the bill. Very nice. She checked on us several times and kept our drinks full. The owner or maybe manager came over and he was very nice. Very genuine and you could tell that he really cared about what people thought and wanted everyone to have a great experience. Where I would have probably given this place 4 stars, his presence and personality easily put it at 5 stars. Service was impecable. Pizza and dessert was really good, and they made a new customer out of me!",

The meatball trio was delicious and the caprese stack was excellent.  We then built our own thin crust pizza which was amazing.  They have daily specials and I tried one of the expresso after dinner drinks that was pretty good.  Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely go back again soon.  i recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.",

First visit around 4 pm chandler Blvd. Very Clean nicely decorated, friendly welcome and goodbye, booth comfortable seats cushy, TV, prompt service. Ordered for my wife and I. Ordered 2 speciality pizzas. We shared boneless chicken wings in a semi hot red sauce excellent. Shared a Mediterranean Greek salad very good ( not as good as GRIMALDI'S which is perfect), but very enjoyable would order both again. We did combo meats pies with all the meats each pie different combinations with the red sauce. Would definitely come back. Thoroughly enjoyed the lunch experience and it's just not the pizza. You can order off a varied menu. Took home about a whole pie half of one half of the other. Reheated a few days for lunch in a cuisinart pro convection oven 400 degrees about 5 minutes, very thin pizza, needs to be watched. Well it was even better reheated. SO NOW WE HAVE 2 different style pizza restaurants to eat in and always looking for another. Took 3 years to find 2.",

This is a great pizza place.  I have gotten carry out, delivery and eaten in quite a few times.  The restaurant is very nice and above average for your normal pizza place around here.  They have two things that make it a cut above most pizza anywhere.  The first thing is the spinach pizzas. If you don't like spinach stay away, but if you do, it's a real treat. The other gut busting thing to try if you are really hungry is the Baked Spaghetti Calzone. If that sounds awesome to you then yes it's that amazing.  It's a carb overload, but so worth it.

The presto sauce and artichoke hearts lacked flavor. The service was not the greatest. We ordered some wings and put the bones on our plates. When our pizza came out the server didn't ask us if we needed new plates or take the plates with the bones on them.",

The move east has caused us to look a bit and outside of buddyz in queen creek we haven't found one that we love.  That may have changed tonight when we landed at spinatos. We had a delicious large thing crust.  Next trip we would ask for extra crispy but the crust was nice and light and the red sauce is amazing! The service in the bar by Janet was on point and the margarita was delicious! One cocktail, one soda and a side Cesar salad with a large 4 topping care in around 40.00 not bad! We will return!!!",

The calzone was a mess, it did not resemble a calzone, it looked like someone put topping on a pizza crust and folded it over like a quesadilla, and it was just about as thin... plus it was overcooked. We ordered two types of cheese on it and when we bit into it there was barely much cheese to be found. Also the calzone had an overly sweet marinara sauce. The thin crust pizza was hot when it got to our door and in our mouths, but yet again the sauce was overly sweet and the overall taste was semi palatable. So we both ate till we were physically full, but in the end we were far from satisfied and the price made the experience so much worse. We both agreed paying more than $20 for that meal would have been a ripoff. Lastly the guy who delivered it was so high that it was hard to understand him.",

    "text": "I had heard mixed reviews about this place before joining another couple for date night here.  It was a Friday night and the other couple chose this place - which was fine until we showed up and there was a 20 minute wait.  I understand places get busy, especially on a weekend.  That said, there are SO many options in this valley of the sun that I have avoided any wait these past few years, because, well, I don't like it.  We finally got seated, and I realized (this is the pre-food opinion) it was basically Olive Garden.  I have nothing against kids or families, but on date night I don't like having crayons thrown at me unless I can throw them back.  This isn't necessarily the restaurant's fault per se, but an ambiance that welcomes this type of behavior / parents who let their kids run wild isn't my idea of fun (yet).  The drinks were fine, the Greek salad was really tasty & the pizza was decent.  Service was so-so, I can remember nothing about our waitress other than we were helped more by passers by and busboys.  Let me be clear, I'm not trashing Olive Garden - it serves a purpose in the biz, but it's not an atmosphere / environment that I want when it's date night and I'm trying to have good conversation with friends.  It's possible that this review may change when I'm the dude with rowdy kids, but for now, until that day, there is no reason to rush out and experience this joint.",

I recommend the Italian sausag and fennel, which comes with a balsamic drizzle.  Delish!

The sauce was so sweet I did not enjoy the pizza, but I got through it. Plenty of leftovers for my husband to eat. My daughter had the kids pizza and ate it all and enjoyed it. I also ordered a summer drink that had Malibu and the first one was really good. Order another one and it was so strong my husband even agreed and had to finish it for me. So for me two stars for the wings and my family enjoying the food. Service was slow but the young lady was nice.",

They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.  In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!  We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",

The new Ahwatukee location took the place of Chili's on the NE corner of 48th St. and Chandler Blvd. This location has an extended menu from its four sister locations including additional appetizers, salads, and sandwiches. Spinatos take on a calzone is light (having significantly less bread than most calzones) fresh, and you can make any pizza or sandwich into a calzone. No gooey undercooked bread here. The crust is always thin and light but not to the point of feeling you are eating a cracker. The Brownie Bella Grande is simply amazing. I am not even a dessert guy but the warm brownie squares, gelato ice cream, and chocolate sauce is just too good to resist.   This is one of those local restaurants that just gets it. Great food, great prices, and great service.",

When I moved to Arizona from the east coast, I had a hard time finding a good pizza... always on the lookout for a good pizza.  Well, I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered a thin crust with cheese, as I like to just taste the basic pizza first.  I did not like their sauce at all.  It is too sweet for me and didn't taste fresh to me.  It didn't taste \"tomatoey\" either.  I thought, \"well it must be me,\" so I asked my husband.  He said, \"that's funny because I thought it was just me too.\"  I wasn't real impressed with the crust either.  The cheese was acceptable, I will give them two stars for that.    We brought some home for the kids, as we didn't eat but one slice each.  Our kids weren't that thrilled either.  Sorry Spinato's.  I know you have excellent fans, but your sauce didn't make me one.  I really wanted to like it too.  (Our family much prefers Barro's Pizza or Rush Street Pizza in Chandler.)",

The sauce tastes fresh and has something extra in it that gives it an almost addicting flavor.  I prefer the \"thin crust\" which is still on the thick side.  We always order extra for a tasty leftover treat the next day.  For a pizza place, Spinato's did not ignore the importance of having a full bar with great glassware.  Our favorite waiter is by far, BOBBY C.!!!  He is a character and a half and always makes our Spinato's dining experience entertaining and fun!  He also knows a thing or two about wine too!.   They do not take reservations and the wait can be quite long on a weekend night.  However, the pizza is worth the wait and will not disappoint!",

As a Chicago native I am quick to judge pizza because SERIOUSLY nothing compares to what I'm used to (Lou Malnatis and Giordano's). The pizza I had here had the similar buttery crispy crust that I'm used to and had a very good sweet sauce similar to Palermo's. I'm very excited and now I know where to go for pizza! It was very delicious!",

It tasted really good the next morning unmicrowaved so i appreciated that.  I usually order Barros so im forgiving of this place for not being better since Barros is pretty bomb.  I'd eat Spinato's again but only if there wasn't a Barros OR Venezia's close by.",

I grumbled and whined, because I thought it was going to be like the Olive Garden. Boy was i wrong! The service was awesome. While the crowd waited, they passed out pizza samples and made sure everyone that wanted one got one. Once seated our server Clint (shout out to Clint!) was the best waiter I have ever encountered. Even though the restaurant was packed, he sat down to explain all the good things to order. We ended getting a small greek salad, Half Mama spinato & The Combo pizza, and a small cheese pizza. Everything was delicious. Shockingly, the stand out was the Cheese pizza. Will definitley be back to this place. Don't let the long wait scare you away. It's worth it.",

They told us we could not sit at the bar because there was no bar tender working and there would be 10-15 wait to be seated at a table in half full restaurant so we decide shift gears and try Spinato's.  My god am I glad we did! Walked in and sat at the last two open stools at the bar.   Ordered a beer, wine and couple different pizzas.     Everything was perfect!   Beer was freezing cold and pizza was cooked to perfection.   I am guessing everything on the menu was equally as good.  We were tempted to go back on Saturday for lunch but decided to wait until next Friday.  If you have never been there, you have to try it, by far the best pizza I have ever had in Arizona!",

Tempe location has been the same great pizza for 10 years. Ahwatukee location seems to differ based on who's cooking. The biggest change in the last year is the bar staff isn't what it once was. Not quite the friendly attentive service and slot of standing around talking. Still one of my favorites but wish the service piece and consistency would improve to get even close to the TEMPE location.",

To switch ham out for artichoke (replace a meat for a vegetable) it was a 2 dollar up charge. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe they had some special artichoke, so we tried switching it with onion, but yet again it was a 2 dollar up charge, very unfair and money driven. Also the price of the pizza was very steep for the minimal amount of toppings and crust. You pay about 28 dollars for sauce and globs of cheese. To get the pizza cut a different way, guess what another up charge. The overall taste was a 4/10. The service was sloppy, rude, and unknowledgeable. Overall this place was very very bad and will not be returning any time soon.",

Having a full bar, having a much bigger restaurant and looked to be a bigger menu but I could be mistaken on that.  I came in at 5 on a Sunday and was surprised to find out it was happy hour ! A good happy hour to boot ! The bartender Clint gave me lots of different amazing sounding drink suggestions, and cool to see a pizza place that does freshly made cocktails, he mentioned they make their own fruit juices and simple syrups, not enough places do that now a days and it shows in drink quality. I tried a few of his suggestions and enjoyed them both!  It was also happy hour for their food so I got way more then I could possibly eat. A very generous portion of garlic cheese bread for 4 dollars ! That could have been enough but a small pizza for 9 bucks with like 4 different meats on it was to good to pass up !  The girl who dropped my food off was super nice and asked if I needed anything else and brought me out some extra sauce, just little things like that go a long way!  If your'e coming for a drink and some pizza and don't wanna spend crazy amounts for quality product come check this place out. I suggest sitting at the bar and ordering the old roy !  wont find better costumer service wont find better pizza.  only thing I could say would make this the perfect experience was if they had the game on.",

The wait was about thirty minutes on a Friday night at 6:00pm but that was to be expected. We were seated in about 25 minutes.   My fiance and I had heard rave reviews about the Mamma Spinato's Spinach Pizza beforehand so it was between this or a create your own. We settled on the Mamma Spinato's to try something different. It consisted of a thin crust with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella and I ordered half with jalapenos for a bit of a kick. It was fantastic! Great flavor. It was a little heavy on the spinach but it did not over power the pizza completely. The sauce here is fantastic and I would like to now try other flavors of pizza for comparison. We also had some hot boneless buffalo wings with ranch which were pretty good, not great but good.   I had ordered a \"Snakebite\" drink from the bar menu. It was a nitro milk dark beer combined with Crispin hard cider. It was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this. I am a dark brew kind of girl and this really hit the spot. It was the perfect combination of bitter and sweet. Really good. Also very good selection of beer on tap.  Overall very good experience. Service was a little slow but they were busy and I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I will be back to try more.",

My husband lemonade that was super concentrated, we had to water it with other two glasses of plain water to be drinkable, and he also ordered Cajun Chicken Pasta which had too much oil and look like soup instead of pasta and was bland. Hanna, the waitress was exceptional in trying to make us feel comfortable but after speaking with the manager and ordering another calzone, we get the bill and we get charge $6 dollars more than original price. My husband and I, of course will never go back there, since the waitress seemed to be the only one who know how to do her job. I would not recommend this place at the moment for food, but I recognized it has all the potential to do much better.",

Draft beer prices are amazing and the service was good. I highly recommend the Strawberry Gorganzola salad. It will blow your mind man! The bread they use for their sandwiches has to be made in house or delivered daily because it is perfect. Slight buttery crunch on the outside and soft warm goodness on the inside. The last bite of my Italian sandwich was as good as the first (I can't believe I ate the whole thing)! Go! Eat! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "For a place that puts such care into their pizza, i will never understand why they would lax on their quality when it comes to sandwiches.  Being from Chicago, i tend to be critical of Pizza, but i actually really enjoy Spinatos.  The crust is good, and they use fresh ingredients and creative combinations that make it very good.    Where i was greatly disappointed was in the quality of their sandwiches.  I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and was very surprised to see that the chicken was clearly from a freezer variety breast that we can all find at Costco or anywhere else.  This was disheartening, given the fact that the bread was soft on the inside and crusty on the outside, and all the other ingredients were spot on.  Why would they risk everything by cutting corners on their meats?  Made me wonder, how many other ingredients originate in a freezer box.    As Gordon Ramsey would say..... They probably spend more time and energy freezing, thawing, and recooking this chicken then they would with fresh product.    I am afraid to try the Italian Beef, as this is another Chicago Original that i would demand nothing less then perfection on. My recommendation to the owners is to ditch the freezer... Make all original, all fresh ingredients.  People can tell the difference.",

Very italian looking and cozy feeling.  They have a fantastic selection of food and the best pizza I have ever had. I'm pretty sure they add crack to their pizza sauce since it is highly addictive and sweet. We have sat in both the bar and restaurant and had the same courteous and quick wait staff attention in both areas.  My favorite item is the appetizer spaghetti baked calzone with ricotta and meatballs.  This is just big enough you can eat it as a meal yourself.  The salads are large in size and the dressings taste fresh. My favorite pizza is hard to say but the \"Get Meaty\" and \"Spicy Italian\" are both heaven in a thin crust. Check please and a wheel barrow! Oh and they have a nice selection of beers on tap.  I'm such a fan, I'm probably here at least once every other week.",

I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest.",

All 22 people left happy, thanking me for the suggestion and raving about how good the food and service were.

Wings get 4.5 Stars \"6\" pizza gets 4.5 Stars Spinach and Garlic pizza gets 3 stars from the wife and 5 from me.

Bartender seemed unconcerned but finally gave us a salad smashed into a container free of charge.  We have had great service on Thursday nights but apparently it depends on who's working.  Definitely felt unwelcome.",

My friend brought one of their pies by the other day and I loved it so much, I decided I'd have to order myself and see if the delish-ness would be duplicated.  The delivery was timely, and the PIZZA!! It's like a NYC style pizza cut into the cool Chicago-style pieces (which I've always loved). The pizza was easily the size of a typical large pizza found elsewhere.  Oh, I also ordered extra sauce cause I remembered loving it when my friend brought over her pie.  ALL the toppings were generous and even with the extra sauce the crust was perfect.  Unfortunately for the fat-distribution on my already ample belly, I've now found another addictive pizza place.",

Our server, Jason, was awesome!  Quick, funny and very understanding when my husband accidentally spilled his beer. He even replaced it! Which I have never experienced anywhere.

I had the calzone while my four dinner friends each had the pizza. Overall we enjoyed the meals and the presentation. Being an aficionado of Italian food and recognizing the importance of a good marinara I found the sauce to be a little sweet. If you are using good tomatoes the sweetness is within. I always question the automatic addition of sugar. It was still a nice dinner with friends and I would recommend this restaurant.",

We travel eight months out of the year, live in Tucson, would with out hesitation, drive up to go to the store and have this great pizza and other food items.

We were seated and placed our order by 8:30 and our order did not come out until about 8:55. The restaurant was dead and anyone who was there already had their food so it was perplexing that our order was taking so long. By the time it came out we felt rushed to eat our meal quickly since the restaurant closed at 9. Next to our table there was a group of extremely loud patrons who were obnoxious, swearing and very disruptive. It was hard to eat our meal and they were so loud it physically hurt our ears. A customer that was seated by table of loud people at one point asked if they would stop cussing so they could enjoy their meal. The loudness continued and I honestly feel management should have stepped in and told them to pipe down or get out. What a horrible first impression of this location.   The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because our dinner was good. I had the fettuccini alfredo and my husband had pizza and they were both enjoyable. We took home a slice of tiramisu and it was ok but we would not order it again. We will not be returning to this location ever again, but we will definitely check out another location because we liked the food.",

We had been here once earlier with a party of 12 and they couldn't accommodate us because they were busy, so we tried our luck again today and we made it there. The restaurant was pretty empty, we were seated immediately but the service was super slow.  There is quiet a lot of options to choose from but I settled with Chicken pesto pesto personal size considering I was the only one eating it. When it arrived I was in shock looking at the size. It was technically a kids pizza. Few of my friends ordered small and it was in-between a medium and small which could be easily eaten by 2. I was not impressed with the sizing they had.  The taste however was good, there was not much of chicken but it had a lot of asparagus and pesto. The olive oil dripped and it was not the best pizza but I can live with it.  The price for a personal size came around $9.50 with tax and it wasn't worth it and small size was about $12 which could be eaten by 2. Either they remove personal size from the menu or increase the size. I would want to go again and try but this has been my first experience.",

He was very nice and polite. We ordered drinks and they were brought over at a normal speed. Everything that we ordered came out about the time we expected. There were no delays and I think this has to do with their set up. They have any worker bring over liquor or food out when it's ready rather than wait for the main waiter. We got the Sicilian style pizza that is thicker. It was very good. Loved having onion and bell peppers on it. They forgot my sausage on it, but made up for it with a comp'd tiramisu. The tiramisu was above average but not amazing. Overall it was a great visit and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! 3+ HOURS LATER AND I BARELY GOT MY PIZZA AT 10:30 AT NIGHT.  I ordered my pizza exactly at 7:38 pm online. I ordered 1 pizza (half cheese, half pepperoni, nothing special) + 1 side of garlic bread. Got the email confirmation stating it typically takes around 45 min, but could take longer on weekends. That was fine, but I really didn't expect to wait 3+ hours and have to call twice to find my pizza.   We called around 9:10 after waiting 1.5 hours. We were immediately placed on hold for a good 3-5 minutes, and then finally were told that the pizza left around 8:50. We figured if he must have left 20 min ago that he would be close or here soon, right? Maybe they just were super busy?  WRONG. Our pizza was no where to be found still 2 hours later...it's 9:38. We have to call back. Employee working is confused and asks to check our phone number again as we explain it's been 2 hours since we ordered and 1 full hour since they told us the driver LEFT the store with our pizza. I'm sorry, but driving around for an HOUR?   On the 2nd call we've spent over 15 min talking to them while they attempt to find our order + track the driver down + \"help\". It's 9:40 PM now... over 2 hours since we ordered....still no pizza. Now they're telling my boyfriend on the phone he's \"wrong\" about the first employee telling us that the pizza left the store at 8:50. In his words, he's the manager and that she would have \"no way of knowing that kind of information\" and that they would be leaving right now and be here within 3 minutes...wrong again....  After this 2nd 15 min phone call and being told we were \"wrong\", we were told he was going to (in his words) \"make it right\" and the pizza would be here shortly. After expressing our worry of it being old and cold since it's been hours, he said he'd also refund us. We said thank you and were appreciative he'd offer the refund.  Well....it's 10:30ish now. I just got my pizza. I will say, the girl that delivered it to us was very polite, apologetic, and kind, which we appreciated. However, the \"manager\" told us it would be out to us and delivered within the next 3 minutes during our call at 9:40...yet they still took an additional 40 minutes from the time he told us that?! Therefore, right when she pulled up, my boyfriend had already left to run to McDonald's since we assumed they gave up on our order...I mean, who says it will be there within 3 min and then takes almost 40 min? Of course the pizza that was finally delivered was ICE COLD. Literally had to have been sitting out for hours and was completely burnt!!!! We couldn't even eat it if we wanted to now.  Not to mention, this place IS more expensive than most pizza places around. I paid $30. I could have ordered pizza just as good, if not better, for half the price and would have received it in 1/3 of the time.  Absolutely horrible experience.",

    "text": "Follow up to my last visit: over the phone the general manager graciously offered to \"buy us dinner\" if we chose to come back on a day that he was working. The group of 5 of us all decided we would give Spinato's another chance this evening and went back in around 7PM. As we walked in we were very kindly greeted by Brian the general manager, he told us he would take care of us and to enjoy our meal. Our server throughout the meal (Cole) was attentive and great! Again, the food was delicious (although one of us ordered wings and didn't love it so I would recommend the pizza).   It only went downhill when we received the check and were told it was 50% off. At first, we were confused and a bit upset but initially just paid and left. Once outside we all decided that we really would not have come back so soon if we had not been told that they would comp the meal. Myself and one of my friends went back in and tried to talk to the same closing \"manager\" Michael about this misunderstanding. Michael claimed that he had \"no power\" to change this for us and comp the entire meal as promised. We went back outside to the other three and ended up coming back in with my girlfriend. This time we explained the situation to one or two of the servers and they had Michael come back up.   This is where it got real bad: Michael arrived back at the host stand and said in a condescending and sarcastic tone, \"So you guys didn't want to pay for dinner tonight?\" This set all three of us off and while we weren't yelling we did raise our voices to a more forceful tone as we could not believe our ears. He was complaining that he had already comp'd our ranch dressing from the other night ($2.36 total lol) and was implying we were asking for way too much when it is what we were promised.  In the end, he did refund both of the cards. This was kind of bad in its own way as he had previously claimed not to have the power to do this...  We made sure our tips were paid and left after this,with lots of disbelief from Michael's behavior.   I honestly do not understand how Michael can be a closing manager or shift lead. Both Cole and Kirsten were very understanding of the situation and willing to listen to us unlike Michael. Every server/employee that I have ever had at Spinato's has been great until these two incidents. I would also like to make the point that two of the six of us eat at spinatos around once per week, so we don't have anything against this restaurant in general. they will not be eating or ordering from here at least not as often in the future. Again I love spinatos pizza and I would always recommend going to the other locations, ordering takeout, or even going in and asking not to be sat with Clint or Michael.",

I had the chicken parm, my wife had the penne ala vodka and our daughter and son-in-law shared an antipasto salad and everyone raved about their choices.  Since a friend recommended Spinato's to us last month it has fast become our favorite Italian restaurant, so we highly recommend it to our fellow yelpers!",

We got \"Nicole's Favorite\" which had fresh basil, mozzarella, feta, and pepperoni. We asked to make half with sun dried tomatoes as I don't eat meat. The sun dried tomatoes were very good on it. The pizza was extremely fresh and the basil tasted like it was just picked off the vine. The pizza was piping hot and fresh out of the oven. Atmosphere is more of an upscale pizza joint with nice decor. It wasn't busy around the time we went, around 4:00 I believe? The kids working there were polite, not overly customer service oriented but I have no complaints. The pizza did take about 40 minutes to come out but that's only because of how fresh everything is, it's well worth the wait.

    "text": "Went out w my fam for a birthday lunch for my bro. I've had spinatos before at the office courtesy of my coworkers.   The place was clean and we had a big party in the back room and a lot of traffic wasn't walking behind us so I didn't have to worry about anyone making me scoot my chair in as I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for PIZZA!   The pizza is awesome it never disappoints.  We had some pepperoni pizza, some meaty pizza w peppers and even a gluten free pizza and honestly I would eat that gluten free pizza all day. It was thin and crispy and held up the toppings well!  Per person we spent about $12-$15 total but my family are hearty eaters. Heck a child in our family can clear half a medium pizza and wings. Yes yes we're working on child obesity in the US don't worry.  I dabbled in everyone's food as I always do. I had artichoke stuffed mushrooms with pancetta on top. I really liked the saltiness of the pancetta cutting in with the mushrooms, cheese and artichoke. It was a good idea.  We also tried pasta. The spaghetti w marinara was ok the house sausage added was too done almost burnt - I suppose some may appreciate that & the noodles felt cold against the warm marinara. One thing I don't like about pasta is it being rolled in olive oil before served. That tells me it's not fresh and pre cooked and sat a while and it tasted like it. I will pass on any pasta dish in the future bc what others ordered didn't look impressive either.  Lastly the calzone. We got a Chicago steak calzone which is served with au jus n I added sweet peppers. It was so so. The crust was actually the best part whereas the filling was just meh. I will pass on the steak calzones but maybe I'd try a sandwich next time. I'm sure a diff combination would be good maybe pesto or something would have gave it that wow!   The service was great, our waiter attentive and I never complain when we come w more than 5 people bc I feel more sorry for the staff than us. He brought out a free cannoli for the birthday boy also which he enjoyed saying, \"it was good and it was sweet too.\"   Do I recommend spinatos? Of course their pizza is out of this world. My kids are very picky about their pizza (they didn't get that from me...maybe) but they loved spinatos pizza and devoured it like cavemen.   The only reason it didn't get my 5 star review was because of how some of our food turned out.  Parts were done extremely well and others were meh. I don't like feeling meh. I even took the pasta home to let the noodles soak up the sauce and you know how spaghetti is awesome the day after? I was still meh.",

The next time I was in town I stopped in and tried the restaurant itself, and really had a good time.  I don't know what this place was before, but I swear it used to be a Chili's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well decorated.  Warm well decorated interior with a full bar and a great menu. Lots to choose from, and not just pizza (even though its their specialty.)  I really like the decor of this place. Not overstated, but classy enough that you can take your parents here and not have them freak out like mine do.  It feels like a great date spot too.  Service was great, and I really had a good time and the pizza and salad that I had were tasty.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. Check it out, worth the trip if you want something different and want to have a good time.",

I had ordered delivery during the dinner rush and was ok with the 60 minute delivery time. As I was placing my order I noticed that they didn't have a text box for miscellaneous requests like peppers or plates like most pizza places, nor was there an option to pay for these additional items, which I don't mind doing. I picked up the phone and called the store and waited 10 minutes on hold. Again, I understand this was during the dinner rush. When the server returned to my call, I asked if he could make sure that there were additional peppers and cheese as we were having additional people over later that evening, and he said he would make  sure that additional cheese and peppers were in the box. Pizza finally gets here and it's delicious; I just wish there were condiments that I was promised that I could share with my friends.",

I got the lentil rosemary soup, which was flavorless and had hardly any lentils.  They tout themselves for making homemade soup, but I could have easily made a more flavorful and filling soup at home. For my entree I ordered the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad with added chicken.  The server forgot the chicken and when it was brought, it was not real chicken breast, but the formed chicken frozen from a bag.  Super salty and cold.    The service was not slow, but everyone at the table commented on how angry and rude the server behaved.  Clint seemed so unhappy to be there and it really showed.  Will never come back.",

    "text": "I've been frequenting this location since they opened in Ahwatukee. The food started out great, got a little worse, then better and now we are back to worse. The antipasta salad used to have plenty of the good ingredients but now it's mostly lettuce and cucumbers that are less than fresh. They scrimp on the heirloom tomatoes, the artichokes are small and flavorless, and there is hardly any cheese or deli meats on it. The bread that came with it was stale. I also ordered their baked spaghetti calzone which used to be plump and full of the ingredients I paid for. Now, it's mostly crust and less filling. And pasta is cheap! There was literally one dollop of ricotta in it. What a ripoff.  I can only assume that profits are falling off and so they are trying to stretch their inventory wherever possible but that is not a sustainable decision. You need to do better, Spinato's. Get a new manager or hire a secret shopper to see what is actually being served to your customers (I know you do that because I used to be one many years ago, that's how I found you). Oh, and get a permanent solution to the hot door handle at your take out entrance. You've tied nasty rags to it or taped it shoddily. I can tell you, no one wants to touch that. It's unappetizing. I don't think that's the image you want to project.",

Pasta dishes small for 16 bucks ,  plastic bowls with small protein portions.  Cmon it's pasta - cost is like 2 bucks,  would it hurt to add one more piece of shrimp to the 4 on the bowl?  Pizza was just okay.   AC was not working,  really hot inside.   Too bad the food was not.  Wasn't looking for a free anything but you could have offered something for the heat.   Service was great ,  Erin was good and doing her best knowing we were all kinda sweating.  Tipped 20% - not hear fault.  Hope it gets better and maybe we will comeback.  I won't count you out just yet - you have been good over the years.   Oh lastly, they are prob running out of cocktail glasses so they poured mine on a regular glass.  Kinda killed the mood for drinks.",

The Super Six is incredibly good, including amazing sweet peppers (I also add olives, for a Super Seven). The meatball trio with vodka sauce appetizer is worth the trip itself. I generally go to the Tempe store, but I have always had good, friendly service here as well.",

I have eaten lots of pies at  lots of pizzerias, and I have  to say that Spinato's Pizzeria is one place that serves up a delicious  pies.  Spinato's is Not just another pizzeria; they have a full menu and a product line with sauces and salad dressings. I tend to be picky when it comes to pizza pie and Spinato's doesn't disappoint. The crust on Spinato's pizza pie is thin, and the sauce is perfectly sweet (no acidic taste). The toppings go completely to the edge These pies are the perfect combination of sauce, toppings, and crust.  In addition to Spinato's delicious pies, Spinato's offers great salads. I really enjoyed the Strawberry Gorgonzola Salad made with fresh baby spinach, strawberries, candied pecans, and gorgonzola.  The ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and chicken Alfredo,  were also delicious.  So if you're looking for absolutely delicious Italian food and Superior Service give this place a try you won't be disappointed.",

I was visiting my sister from out of town and she had recommended Spinato's for our last meal out in town. I trust her opinion on the matter since we both inherited our father's appetite for pizza.   We came in on Sunday afternoon and happy hour was available; Can't go wrong with weekend happy hour! We ordered wings in mild and hot sauce and the meatball trio as appetizers. Wings came out perfectly crispy and hot. The mild sauce had a perfect kick, but the hot sauce was a tad too much heat for me, but DUH! it's in the name. We were off to a great start... We debated about getting a medium or large pizza (3 of us), but decided on large so that we would have leftovers for later that night. Our pie came out fast and hot! First bite into the cheesy goodness and i was hooked! The sauce is different than anything I have ever tasted, it was tangy and sweet and perfectly balanced. Remember the \"leftovers\" i briefly mentioned. Well forget I ever mentioned it because there was none at the end of our meal.  A+ for the food!   To top it off the service was awesome! The manager on duty on Sunday 5/27 was on point with making us feel welcomed and ensuring we had a great experience. I wish I caught his name, but I think it was Kelvin or Kevin. It was my first time at Spinato's, but it definitely won't be my last!",

I had read several reviews that the sauce has a sweetness which I prefer than an overly acidic sauce.   Upon arrival, it smelled sweet, but more so for the delicious fluffy crust.   DH said it reminded him of doughnut dough, I couldn't pick up on that as I was still recovering from the first bite of garlic on my pie.   I think I will order that next time I am here.",

Two  of the meals were perfect and delicious.  The other two were spaghetti and meatballs, and there was hardly any sauce on the spaghetti.  In fact, we had to ask for \"extra\" sauce.  We ordered another couple drinks but were informed that the bar had run out of an ingredient needed for one of them.  Our server was not very attentive to us during our meal.  He didn't check to see if we needed anything after our food arrived.  We had to try and get his attention which took a few attempts.  Overall, we were somewhat disappointed with our experience.

Lately, the kids portions have been lessened to 18 noodles (which doesn't even cover the bottom of the bowl). Even though we've been told to order more noodles, which we have, the attitudes by the managers have really resulted from us NOT being a customer any longer. We were were told it may not be the place for us. I'm not sure what type of management says that to its frequent guests? We love Spinatos and it's servers, so for a manager to say this so abruptly really threw  my friends and I off.  Upper management got involved with no resolution except for to speak with the same woman who told us to leave. This is really sad because this is our place we always went to; however, we will not be cheated out of our money for small portions and disrespectful managers. This manager is new and will not see our business anymore. I am really disappointed on how the owners of Spinatos chose to handle this situation. I have owned a restaurant business before and the customer is always top priority.",

I appreciate that their servers jump in and help one another, but because they do that, we never know who our actual server is. It's kind of hard to gauge the tip when you've seen so many faces!

Also, the sauce is sweet, I know that's their thing at Spinato's, but I have to be in a certain mood to want this. I got a calzone here and was surprised when it came out with no ricotta cheese... apparently you have to request it special because when I got the bill it specifically said 'no ricotta'.... I thought ricotta was standard in a calzone... it was really disappointing. The prices here are fair and the food is ok, but it isn't anything special.",

We walked in, friendly staff, newly remodeled dinning room, comfortable booths, and a large menu.  We opted for a Plain cheese pizza, and a small calzone with black olives, mushrooms and the \"optional\" ricotta.   The pizza, was sub par, the crust was like that of a frozen take home pizza, the sauce is sweet and that is the only flavor note no spices etc, the cheese was ok but overpowered by sweetness of the sauce. There are many better options.   The calzone, is really a Stromboli, I wonder why the ricotta is optinal as it would be empty without it. The sauce again was sweet, the ricota and cheese was lacking in volume and the crust was more of a pastry style. Again there are better options.  I can on and on why I don't like the food here but you get the point, the flavors and textures are not what I want from pizza.   Plus I like my pizza sliced not cut into squares.",

We got a \"get meaty\" signature personal pizza, cheesy garlic bread and the trio of meat balls.  The garlic cheesy bread was good but I didn't taste any garlic at all. I specifically ordered this because I love garlic anything! I was really disappointed.  The meat balls were good.  When we got the pizza, I was expecting what was advertised. A Chicago style pizza. Yummy crust! The pizza was not what I expected. It was pretty much flat bread with sauce cheese and toppings. I would have been better off going to Barros.  One thing I can say is the service was polite, and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. I suggest rewording the descriptions of their items though. It should be cheesy bread and flat bread (no crust) pizza.",

Then the pizza arrived, and alongside the waiter was the General Manager, Jenell. She explained that the pizza was not up to their usual standard, as it was lacking the correct amount of cheese, and to compensate for that, they would be providing us with another pizza to take home. We were floored and thanked her profusely! We ate our pizza that we ordered, which was truly delicious, and happily left with another one to freeze at home and enjoy at a later date. Thank you Jenell--you demonstrated such a high level of integrity and commitment to quality and customer satisfaction that we had never before experienced. You now have two new customers for life!",

Just a cool observation - While we were waiting for our table in the bar on a busy Friday night we saw servers/hosts walking around to the packed waiting area with pizza for people to munch on while they waited for their pizza.  Genius!  This family owned business does it right.     We are very impressed so far with their pizza.  We will certainly be back for more.

The sauce, as stated by many people, was sweet and plain - not a hint of Italian seasoning in it. I was prepared for this, and before the pizza was even served I asked the waiter for Italian seasoning. He looked confused. So I said, oregano. He brought a ramekin with a sparse amount (I guess they need to save those pennies).   This did not save the pizza because of crucial element no. 2: The crust that wasn't there. I am serious, the crust was pure air, nothing to it. Wonder Bread has more substance and heartiness to it than their crust had. I have never in my life, including any frozen pizza I've ever eaten, had a more tasteless, pathetic pizza crust than what was delivered. My friend, who doesn't have a keen sense for good food, said \"well maybe it wasn't in the oven long enough\".  Nonsense, the quality was cheap and anyone with taste buds can recognize it.   Shame on Spinato's for being so cheap to serve pizza with dough that isn't nearly half the quality of Pizza Hut ( I was dreaming of Pizza Hut the whole time I was eating their pizza).",

It is thoroughly cooked and adequately balanced with cheese and sauce.  Strangely enough the sauce tastes somewhat different each time I visit.  It is good, but sometimes are better than others.  This place definitely has issues with order taking.  I would say that the orders are outright wrong about 1 in 4 times.  A reasonable price for a reasonable pizza eating experience.",

    "text": "This review goes out to all of the Yelpers out there who bash a restaurant after one bad visit AND to all the restaurants who don't try to make up for their mistakes--you know who you are.  As a preface, my great and friendly waiter confessed to me that in all his years as professional server, he has never had an order that got as messed up as mine, but I still am givng four stars.  How can this be, you ask?   1.  The food I did get was really good.   2.  The Server and the Manager both personally came over and sincerely apologized to me.  They also tried their best to try to improve my total experience by offering an extra serving of what I really did order (to go) and an extra glass of wine (both of which I did not accept). 3.  The restaurant comp'ed my entire meal 4.  My server even said he didn't expect any tip.  (I actually tipped him well)    I was in the Phoenix area for business, so I was dining alone.  Now, I hate eating out alone.  Luckily, I sat at one of the tables in the bar so I was entertained by the D-back's baseball game on all TVs.  I ordered a small Mamma's Signature Spinach Calzone with sausage added and a glass of wine.  I had been nursing my wine for quite a while (about 35-40 minutes) when my server approached and told me that he was really sorry about the long wait.  Something had gone wrong causing my order to be really delayed, but he said that the kitchen was finishing my calzone now.  Finally, he added that they'd be comp-ing my wine because of the delay. I said, OK and sure enough, a few moments later, a calzone appeared.  I was starving by then and dug right in.  One bite into it, I realized that there was no spinach in this calzone--only sausage.  Although a little disappointed that I didn't get the \"signature\" item, the calzone was really good.  Yes, the sauce is a little sweet, but it's not as dramatic as some other yelpers make it out to be.  The outer crust on the calzone is firm, but maintains some softer \"give\" on the inside.    When the server came around to check on me, I mentioned that there was no spinach in the calzone and he turned a little white.  I'm pretty sure that when he had re-entered my order he had forgotten that I had ordered the Singature spinach with Sausage.  Anyway, he immediately asked if I wanted it remade.  I declined since I was so hungry.    In the end, I was very happy with the efforts made to make up for the various mistakes.  I think the fact that I did not flip out made them work all the harder to make amends.  I would go back in a heartbeat if only to try that Mamma's Signature Spinach!",

Their pizzas have really great, fresh flavors - dipping it in ranch or blue cheese dressing is a no-no :) They also have a unique line-up of mouthwatering options, or you can top your own. The kids really enjoy this place and their menu is priced just right. For a family of four with an appetizer, drinks, 16\" pizza and gratuity, I never top $50. I highly recommend giving this place a try! I eat here at least 2x a month.",

It does looks like a high end pizza place from the front but OMG! the food experience is totally beyond my expectation. If you love pizza so much, you definitely should come here. They made the pizza and pasta from scratch and it cooks to perfection. You can smell the charcoal from the edge of your pizza. And the customer service is so impressive!. I went there for Mother's Day and the waiter gave us Italy Connoli (the crispy crust pastry filled with cream and chocolate drip) cause we waited for our food due to the very crowded restaurant!.. Whoever served me - waiter in pink shirt - you got me hooked to this place! I definitely come swing by here again..",

I was even more impressed how they tasted, as anyone whose had gluten free bread products knows it can be a hit or a miss. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza gluten free with an olive oil base since I'm allergic to tomatoes. It was wonderful. Chicken was juicy, pesto tasted fresh, cheese was nice and chewy and not overly greasy. The gluten free crust was flaky and similar to a biscuit,  which was amazing compared to the other gluten free pizza doughs I've had that taste like cardboard. I also ordered the gluten free garlic cheesy bread, as I couldn't remember the last time I've gotten to have garlic bread since I'm gluten free. It was amazing, chewy and buttery and everything I'd want it to be. I will definitely be back since the food was wonderful and hopefully the service will be a little more prompt.",

    "text": "The sauce is usually the under-appreciated element of pizza, but it's front and center at Spinato's.  One's opinion of Spinato's hinges almost totally on his opinion of the unusually sweet sauce.  After yesterday's experience, I've decided that I love Spinato's as on occasional treat, but it's a little rich to be my go-to pizza place.  Everything besides the sauce on the pizza was nearly beyond reproach.  The crust was thin and crisp, but not like a cracker.  It still had some chewiness.  The aforementioned sauce and cheese went nearly out to edges of the pie.  The pizza was cut into squares and toppings were carefully and evenly applied.  The mushrooms were outstanding because they're the canned mushrooms that remain plump and juicy when cooking.  The bell peppers and ricotta cheese were OK, although the ricotta added even more sweetness.  One renegade black olive somehow made it on my pizza, which I found endearing.  If you're not in a pizza mood, they have a full menu with sandwiches, salads, calzones, etc.  They actually have a calzone stuffed with spaghetti.  On a previous visit, we ordered it just as a conversation topic, leading to jokes like \"... so why are Americans getting fatter?\"  I have to admit that the little carbohydrate bomb was pretty tasty.  Nothing was special about the restaurant itself.  (After all, it's a converted Chili's.)  But the pizza is special.  It's high quality and definitely distinctive, which is rare to say about pizza.",

They were surprisingly delicious. My side salad left much to be desired, maybe one or two cucumbers in it. The house dressing was ok, but nothing like Nello's House Italian dressing. We ordered a Spicy Italian Thin Crust pizza which was absolutely amazing, makes me feel better about spending so much for dinner. I'll be back.",

Pizza sauce is definitely on the sweet side so that made them unique. But having toppings like sweet peppers just made it too sweet. We also had the meat lovers and chicken pesto. Pesto was strong and garlicky. I liked it the best. Their antipasti salad was really good too. Overall everything was good. Not sure if I cared for the pizza sauce but everything was good and can't complain.",

I love Italian food to the point where it's an obsession, so I'm always looking for good Italian resturants. And when I found this one I got excited and couldn't wait to try it and I don't regret my decsion at all I highly recommend this resturant. (As a personal side not I've had almost everything on the menu at least three times. But my favorite item on the menu is the meatball sandwich with melted mozzerella cheese. I'm not much of a salad eater but I love there greek salad the resturant calls it going greek it's really good and the title is cool.) So if you haven't had the food or if you haven't been to this resturant I highly suggest you visit it really does have a family atmosphere and that's one of the many things that makes this resturant so cool. But I will warn you once you go you'll never be the same agian I envy you first timers at Spinato's. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Above average, for us at least! We'd heard about them on PBS loooong time ago and I've had them on my Must Try list forever. Finally got down there. It was a Tuesday about 4:30ish. Pretty dead,  honestly. I would assume everyone is recovering from their 4th of July and laying low at home.   So, we didn't know it was happy hour, that was a nice surprise! There's a few pizzas that are on special, and there are drink specials and a few appetizer specials.  Hubby wanted the cheese bread (despite my trying to talk him into the meatballs) and it was better than expected for $3 bucks. The bread was a PERFECT blend of soft, but toasted, chewy crunchy deliciousness topped with a quality mozzarella, perfectly melted and sprinkled with Italian herbs. The marinara was sweet, which we weren't complaining about! You need sweet to cut the acidity in the tomatoes.   On to pizza. Hubs got the Canadian, which is pineapple and Canadian bacon. It was very good, although for some reason his crust wasn't as crispy as mine-not bad at all, just an observation. I think the flavors in the crust and sauce are pretty darn good. POSSIBLY too much sauce on the Canadian pineapple one... Only because the pineapple is sweet, then the sauce is sweet, I think it was literally just a hair oversweet. Just a hair! Still very very good!  I was feeling adventurous! So I tried the special, the sausage and fennel with balsamic glaze. DYNAMITE. sometimes you just get a menu item that is PERFECTLY balanced with several real strong flavors put together, and it works. The glaze really just finished it off with the bow-chicka-bow-wow factor. And my pizza was crisp, the slices did not bend when picked up. Come to think of it, there's no red sauce on that one... Which is probably why it was much more crisp. Perhaps we'll ask for light sauce next time we order the Canadian.  GO. EAT. BE HAPPY.",

    "text": "This is going to be a dousey,  so stick with me for this... Nick and I really enjoy the food at Spinato's Pizzeria and figured it would be a nice treat to take our girls out for a nice dinner. We both understand that we have a good sized family, and we added 2 friends, which brought our dinner party to a nice 8 top. The staff at  Spinato's Pizzeria did not start out to a great start. They were busy, which was understandable, since it was 6ish, on a holiday weekend. I stood at the hostess stand for over 10 minutes, being completely ignored, by at least, 5 people, who stood directly in front of me, refusing to make eye contact, or even greet me. It wasn't until I  asked if I could be added to the list, that someone rudely obliged. They said our wait would be about 40 minutes. I was quite happy the wait was going to be under an hour since we have a 3, 5, 9, and 11 year old. It was super crowded and hot and one of the staff members even got us a few cups of water. We all patiently waited to be seated. The girls were great! They sang a few rounds of Spider Pig and were little angels. We were seated. It took us a few moments to get situated since we have more children than adults. The waitress approached our table with a giant stick up her ass. To be fair,  I get it. Sometimes I am even overwhelmed with our little family,  but, if you know my children,  they are extremely well behaved. I take great pride in being their parent. We placed our order. Nothing extravagant. It's pizza. It's what they do... Once again, our princesses patience, was being tested as we watched 2 family's place their orders after us, receive their food and leave. Our drinks were never offered to be refilled until we had to hunt the waitress down. We finally received our food and began to eat. Still no waitress... still no drinks. We had to get a busboy to hunt her down. She showed up to the table with an I don't have time for you attitude and rolled her eyes when we asked for refills. She then proceeded to put root beer in Pepsi and ignore one of the girls requests completely.  Again we had to hunt her down. She never apologized for her mistake and rolled her eyes again. She rudely asked if we needed boxes. By this time of the night, we are ready to go home. She brings the checks. She took my card and disappeared with it for quite some time and then ran around the restaurant without my card on her for quite some time. I'm not comfortable with waitstaff just leaving my card somewhere until she has time to deal with it. While I was waiting for the check to come back, Nick rounds up the kids and they all head to use the restroom before we leave. (This is the 6th time during our visit) The check comes back as Nick and the girls get back to the table. Nick gives me a weird look and says... No tip. We are NEVER coming back here again. I say ok and we head out the door. We said goodbye to our friends and start to walk to the car... Now this is where SHIT hits the fan... Nick knew best to get me out of the restaurant before he tells me this..   Nick is standing outside the girls bathroom, waiting for them to come out. At this time a MALE employee goes into the girls bathroom!  He never knocked. He never asked if anyone was using the restroom. He went into the woman's bathroom,  unannounced, and looked at my children weird, and didn't excuse him self and leave. This employee STAYED in the bathroom and began cleaning it!!!! While it was still occupied!  Nick was standing there the whole time trying not to lose his shit. The girls hightailed it out of the bathroom and were EXTREMELY uncomfortable!!!!   I went into Mama bear mode and started to walk back into Spinato's Pizza to bring the fear of God into these employees.  Luckily,  Nick was able to stop me. I  spoke with my girls and they are fine, just felt a little uncomfortable and knew to get of there. This is a MAJOR no no in my book. What if Nick wasn't standing there? Obviously we don't let the 3 and 5 year old go to the bathroom by themselves, and the older girls, 9 times out of 10 I have direct eyesight to the bathroom door and they never go alone. But why in the Hell does this employee think that this is acceptable!? If I was in the bathroom, shit would have hit the fan! Would he have even stayed in the bathroom if an adult was there?  One thing that I know for sure, we will NEVER be eating at this establishment again! I will be contacting management and corporate first thing in the morning, as well as many other agencies. This is not going to end well. I regret not going into the restaurant right when I found out, but this way I'll be more composed and able to see others colors, not just red. I know this didn't end horribly as the girls are safe. I just feel violated and vulnerable knowing that this even happened.",

I have been going to spinatos at the Ahwatukee location since it has opened and this was the first time I have been treated terribly. We had a server named Clint who was extremely rude the entire meal. He was very uninterested in us and took so long to refill our drinks and come check up on us. We asked for four ranches and he never explained to us they were extra. At the end of the meal when we received our tab we explained to him that next time it would be nice to know that ranch is extra. He then decided to tell us in a rude tone \"well if you go out to eat you should expect to pay for things\". We then asked for a manager due to this rude comment. He goes off to the soda machine to talk to someone and they are laughing at us. That is when the other guy named Michael came up to us laughed and said I hear you are looking for a manager we replied yes for him to laugh in our face and say \"well that's me\" how much worse could the service get. After talking with him he said I'll take off the ranch. Which wasn't the point at all. When he came back with our tabs he had rung our card for the wrong one.. My family, close friends and coworkers used to come here every week and we have always been good to our servers but after last night I will make sure everyone knows how terrible the service was.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to go to Spinato's for the first time on a Saturday, and the restaurant, although fairly large, was packed. No surprise there, because the food was good, but there was a wait time. Nevertheless, our server took good care of us when we were seated.   I got the combo on gluten free crust, which was really delicious. The crust was similar to the GF crust sold at Sauce: chewy and slightly crunchy at the same time. It's been a while since I've had good pizza. While I never got to try the \"Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach\" pizza that the rest of my family members got, they expressed that the pizza was cooked to perfection - even my mom, who doesn't like cheese, ate a few slices. My mom got the pear & pecan salad, which she expressed was good with a slightly \"sour\" taste to it (the good kind of \"sour\").   The only downside of Spinato's was the wait time for the food - we didn't really mind waiting to be seated but we were very hungry by the time the food came around. It took about 40 minutes for two pizzas and a salad, and it was a challenge to entertain my sister's two hungry and tired toddlers during that time. Although they were given kids' menus with crayons, they showed little interest... because they were hungry. My mom commented that it may have been better to order ahead for a pickup and eat at home, especially in consideration of the children. If you're hungry, I recommend getting an appetizer to munch on while you wait.   Bottom line: great pizza, yummy salad, lots of GF options. Good service. Wait time is long, though, especially on weekends.",

I always get their spaghetti calzone with vodka sauce and their sweet chili or honey bbq wings! Their pizza is really good too! I also love that you can get a \"personal\" size pizza or calzone, because I don't eat a ton and even still that is enough for left overs usually.",

We took advantage of the $9 Specialty Pizzas they offer during Happy Hour and both times ordered the \"Super Six\" which consists of Italian sausage, pepperoni, ham, mushrooms, mixed green & red sweet bell peppers, and mozzarella. Delicious!  We also have tried two of their selection of six salads - the \"Going Greek and the \"Strawberry Gorgonzola.\" Both were fantastic! They have a great beer selection as well.  This is certainly going to be one of our regular eateries. Can't wait to go back and maybe try some of their other pizza offerings or even a pasta dish.",

    "text": "I kind of burnt out on Spinatos so I thought I would write an update to my review. Their sauce is very sweet and so after a while it is easy to get sick of it. Also, the abundance of sauce makes their pizza not very good leftover since it gets all soggy. Really, I still enjoy eating it once in a while but I am just not as hot for it as I was when I first found this place.  Also, even though they do deliver to our area my hubby and I dined in a couple of times over the last several months and experienced really bad service both times. The first time the waitress completely ignored us the entire time. We had to flag someone else down to get utensils and napkins. The second time we were waited on my a teenage boy who couldn't answer any questions about the pizza toppings or beer list... which I also find very lacking. My new pizza place of choice is Mellow Mushroom. Their pizza is nothing too unique but their beer taps are amazing!",

It's a few miles from the Chandler Fashion Square Mall, which why you won't find a SUPER packed restaurant. That's a rare gem if you ask me, especially on a weekend night.    There was not a wait, which was super suprising! I'm used to an Oreganos-like wait in order to get decent pizza or pasta. Everything seems to be advertised as homemade. It honestly tasted like it too. I got the sixth topping (forgot what it's called, something six) pizza. It was delicious.  It was paritucliary sweet. Not sure if all of pizza sauce is that sweet. Wasn't bad st all though. My gf got the turkey and pesto sandwich (I think), and that also was great. The bread was the  best part, and it didn't fill you up with calories either.   It was great pricing. The literal only the thing that could have been better...was the waiter. He was a bit awkward - not to throw anyone under the bus! I'll still be back, and could rate this place 5 stars afterwards...",

The kids spaghetti wasn't even enough for my 3 year old let alone my 8 year old even after we paid extra for each to have a meatball. I ordered the Wrigley Sandwich with a couple of adjustments (not difficult), it was made incorrectly. The server said go ahead and eat that one and we will make you another the correct way to go so you can enjoy it tomorrow. I thought well I wanted it the right way but whatever. It wasn't even an option to send it back and have it fixed. The one they sent home was already wrapped up and tied in a bag so tight I couldn't even open the bag, I had to use scissors. Went to warm the \"correct\" one up the next day and that too was made incorrectly. Guess I'm stuck ordering pizza inorder to have my food correct.",

The substitutions we ordered we easily handled with the  kitchen.  I would recommend this place to everyone! We'll be back for sure. The reason for the four star is the crostini served with each entre. It was extremely bland and oily. I know they are the 'thing' right now, but, flavor, please. Other than that... awesome!",

The sauce was so so sweet it just did not mesh with the spinach at all. Other than that the wings, garlic bread, and the large margherita pizza hold the tomatoes was pretty good (pricy pizza @ $20). For a bill that was  $55, a little more then what I would have expected to pay, this was my 1st time here so now I know. Service with Janet at the bar was excellent so I probably given another go and look at other options next time.",

Ordered takeout here on the way to a friend's house but there was a mixup when I got there: the hostess at the takeout window couldn't find my order. It turns out she gave it to another person by accident, and instead of sorting it out with me at the front, she disappeared for about 5-6 minutes and eventually came back to tell me she had called the lady who had my order, and that lady was driving back with my food........yikes.   The manager that night ended up coming out to sort it all out with me and the woman who drove the food back (who, for good reason, was in a VERY bad mood about the whole situation). My takeout order was comped immediately--thank you!--and I ended up also taking back the food the lady had driven back, since she brought it with her and the kitchen had also remade my order? Super bizarre, and I just felt weird and bad about the lack of communication and long gaps in not getting updates throughout the whole thing (overall, I was waiting there about 20 minutes with only one update from the hostess herself that whole time).   Anyway, the food was amazing, as always--I got the antipasti salad, a Get Meaty pizza, and an order of garlic bread, and my friend and I ended up with double the order because of the whole mixup. I'm sure I'll be back again soon, regardless of the earlier situation with the takeout mixup!",

For my large vegetarian pizza with chicken and a family sized Greek Salad it hits about $40, but it easily and happily feeds 3 greedy people. The Take-out is efficient and they even have Take-out parking. Sometimes I dine-in and when I do the service is always friendly and prompt. They have a fairly decent happy hour too!",

The thing is the food is just the half of it. The service is amazing...it makes the dining experience perfect. We have been there about 6 times over the past 4 months and not once have had bad service.   Everyone is so friendly. Tonight we had a new waitress we had never had before. She suggested a wine that I fell in love with. Also the waiter we had the last time we were there stopped by said hi and made sure we were being taken care of. They really are great at what they do, Other restaurants need to take tips from them.  The food is so good you want to run in the kitchen and yell \"you guys are awesome.\"",

    "text": "A friend recommended Spinato's, and we were in the mood for pizza, so we went the day we got the recommendation.  Our server was pleasant, made good recommendations and kept our drinks filled.  Upon seeing our difficulty making a decision on what specialty pizza to order, she suggested we do half & half...which worked out great...and we were pleased with both choices!  The salad was fine too...nothing special, but nothing to be embarrassed about either.  As others have mentioned, the sauce was sweet...which didn't bother us, but was a surprising difference from other pizza places we enjoy...although, I doubt it will become our preferred style of sauce, I'd certainly be up for in again in the not-too-distant future.  The thin crust was terrific and the toppings were high quality and plentiful.  We went on Sunday, and were surprised to learn that they close at 8pm, so be prepared...but, we noticed they were still seating people close to closing time. Seating was comfortable, especially considering they had a full house.  And, while it would be fair to say it was a bit noisy, it was nowhere near the volume one experiences at an Oregano's (in fact, as much as we like Oregano's food, we never dine in due to the volume level).  There are a number of good pizzas to be had in Chandler--probably the most well-represented category of above-average restaurant choices in our city---, in my opinion, Spinato's can hold it's own among them.",

We ordered Mamma's special or favorite (I forget the exact name - the one with fresh spinach). It was delicious! I loved the thin crust and sweet sauce. Pizza was not greasy and was well seasoned. Probably one of the best pizzas I've had in the valley.  Service was friendly. A small gripe I have is that our food took very long to come out. A very long time. Before I got the chance to mention it, our server took the initiative to tell us that our food was taking longer than usual because a large party's order was backing up the kitchen. I appreciated that he explained and apologized, but he could have offered us some bread or crackers or some fruit or something. My 3 and 5 year olds were hungry and getting antsy. I had to ask for something (bread) to hold them over and he acted like he was going to charge us for it, which I thought was ridiculous.  As soon as he walked away, someone brought our food out, so I waived our server down to cancel the bread order. You would think he would have comp'd us something because we had to wait an unreasonably long time for our food. Still, he was friendly and attentive, albeit a little clueless.  I'll give this place another chance. The food was great (once we got it). Very family friendly too.",

My favorite is the Spicy Italian w/ Banana Peppers.  Calzones and sandwiches are also very delicious, I like the meatball and Italian sausage sandwiches.

We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants.  They are great people.  We were excited to see the new Ahwatukee location open.  We were loyal to the Tempe location, but this new one is closer.  I love what they did with the old Chili's.  It is beautiful!  They really did a great job.   While my review of 5 stars is for the Company as a whole, I have to say that this new location is not my favorite and I probably won't return.   The food is amazing, that is not a problem.  I could eat Spinatos pizza and food everyday for the rest of my life.  But this location lacks the family feel that I'm used to.  On both occasions that I've gone here, I've received poor service.  The wait times for a table are grossly underestimated.  I was told 30 minutes (at an off peak time), and it was 65 minutes later that I got a table.  Our waters were never refilled and we didn't see our server until we flagged her down to get our check.    While this location is beautiful and I'm so happy for the family, I won't be back there.  I'll keep going to the \"hole in the wall\" Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family, and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years.

    "text": "I gotta hand it to Spinatos.  When I first came here the service was abysmal, but lately they have really stepped up their game.  This place does a great job lately at being accommodating to customers and of course as always bringing out delicious food. My friends and I started coming here for the Chicago pizza, and no it is not the deep dish that city people know and love, but it is really good.  I promise. The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  They have some really good flavor combinations and a variety of pies to choose from.  Their sauce is sweet and tangy swirled over the top in a unique way.  The crust is buttery and spongy (I always get the \"deep dish\") with just the right amount of crunch.Also I got a cannoli on my birthday which was really tasty. I love Spinatos.  It is  great place to take my out of town visitors for great food.",

The waitstaff are great and super nice. From the pizza to the calzones this place does it right!! Try everything because the sandwiches, pastas, salads, and everything else are amazing!!",

The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathrooms, which is something that is always concerning to me. So if you're looking to try some place new with great prices and service I would highly recommend Spinato's!",

    "text": "Spinatos is my favorite pizza in the valley. The sauce is on the sweet side, but very good. I prefer the thin crust. The service has been above par every time I've been. They gave me a free second pizza once because they weren't satisfied that the first one had a bubble in the dough. I hadn't complained about it, they just weren't satisfied themselves. They gave me both for the price of one, and I happily ate both (with a little help from my daughter).",

    "text": "I picked up pizza from here tonight so my review is regarding take out only.  Ordered a medium create your own pizza- thin crust with roasted peppers and red onion also ordered a gluten free with roasted peppers.  The pizza was not cooked evenly when I brought it home. Almost tasted like a frozen pizza that was baked halfway. Half the pizza was cooked well but the other half was barely cooked through. The sauce is too sweet for my liking. Overall these pizzas were nothing I would spend $30 for.  I can't believe I ordered from here and not Nello's...my usual pizza joint which never disappoints.  NEVER AGAIN. also, the staff were kind of rude on the phone when I placed the order. Lady sounded really rushed like she had a million things to do. When I picked up my order the lady helping me also seemed really rushed...but there wasn't anything she would have been doing. This place needs better customer service.",

    "text": "A dissenting opinion... First timer & grabbed a calzone to go.  Eccck... halfway thru and made a pbj sandwich instead (and I'm a pizza nut).  Sauce... tasted tinny like the inside of a can, and super sweet with no real flavor profile.. Sausage... kind of tasted like the pre-cooked rabbit pellets little ceasars uses. Crust... thin & no 'bite' to it.  No, I wasn't expecting a deep dish crust, but this had no flavor and just crumbled as i ate.  Plus... great looking place, friendly staff, ready when promised. This wasn't a \"bad\" pizza because they did anything wrong.  If you like their flavors.. go for it.  Just compared to most local places of quality, it totally turned me off flavor wise.  Sorry folks, not my cup of tea.",

    "text": "My friend had recommended Spinato's Pizza so I decided to try it out with her since I had never been and she had liked it. Spinato's is a locally owned family pizzeria that started in Phoenix in 1974. They now have 5 locations spread throughout the valley. Since I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, I was more than excited to try this new pizzeria especially since it was Chicago style pizza. The best pizza I ever had was in fact in Chicago.  We arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening and the place was starting to getting crowded. The hostess seated us in the bar area since it seemed like a more ideal place to sit versus the dining room. She dropped off the menus and advised that our server would be with us momentarily. We waited about 15 minutes or so before our server acknowledged that we were in her section. She got our drink and food orders since we had more than enough time to make up our minds.  My friend opted to get the Going Greek salad (side $3.99) and the Tomato Basil Bruschetta ($7.29). I decided on the personal 7\" sized Baked Spaghetti Calzone w/meatballs ($5.49). I decided to not drink as I had to drive and I wanted to get dessert.  She got her salad and the bruschetta which she shared with me. When I think of bruschetta, I imagine it on a sturdy crispy piece of french bread or baguette  not on a piece of focaccia. Now don't get me wrong - I love focaccia as much as the next person, but focaccia isn't a sturdy piece of bread to pile on tomatoes drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bruschetta was good but did not blow me away by any means. It had good flavor but it's not something that sticks out in my mind.  Half way through the bruschetta, our server brought the baked spagetti calzone which was enormous and I got the smallest size! I can only imagine what the other sizes look like (out of control). It smelled delicious and had marinara sauce spilling over the top of it. I took my first bite and was absolutely horrified by what I tasted. The sauce was sweet?! Who on earth makes sweet marinara sauce? That should be a crime! It didn't even have the slight essence of Italian herbs that are a requirement in all marinara sauces and the sweetness was overbearing. I had to doctor it up by piling on the parmeasan and the red pepper flakes before I deemed it edible. I was able to eat half of it before I decided it was time for dessert.  The dessert was Spinato's only saving grace from getting one star from me. I'm partially lactose intolerant and can't eat ice cream, ranch or sour cream (I know my life sucks!) they had gelato which I can eat! My friend got two scoops of vanilla bean and chocolate and I decided to get pistachio, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla bean. The gelato was decadently smooth and creamy. I wasn't thrilled about the pistachio as I could sense the almond extract in it and I'm not a fan! The raspberry and vanilla bean made up for it. The raspberry sorbet was tart and sweet and mixed with the vanilla bean balanced each other out. We had to be wheeled out because we were so full...it was official - I had a spaghetti calazone baby! Overall, I was not impressed with Spinato's and there are better pizzerias in Phoenix that one can go to. I like that it's locally owned, a family owned business, and their gelato.",
