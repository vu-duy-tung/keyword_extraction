I ignored it and continued to eat the other half of the sandwich. I pulled 2 more hairs out of the other half so I decided to take the sandwich back. When I explained the situation, the employees were very nice and offered to make me a new sandwich. While I was waiting the owner or manager named Michael confronted me and was very rude and aggressive. He implied that I was lying about the hairs and asked me to show him the hairs. Obviously I didn't keep them. So he rolled his eyes at me and gave me very dirty looks until I left. Apart from the friendly employees this place is not worth going to. The food is just ok and if you have any complaints expect to be verbally attacked.",

I discovered there was this location down the street from my office and have been eating here just about every other day for lunch! Last week our office placed an order for a meeting! The sandwhiches taste the same every time!!!  I have ordered the Italian, Turkey and the Bobbie! I usually change things up on my order and not once have i had a bad sandwhich or gotten back to my office with anything but what I ordered. I recently started ordering the cheesesteak, and although my favorite cheesesteaks usually have cheese-wiz, I freaking love their sandwich! I add extra cheese to it and it is amazing tasting. I haven't ordered anything but this sandwich the last 10 visits.   Warren is a top notch owner and was actually the person who took my order on todays visit. It is nice to see an owner that is hands on with his company!! You do not come across that very often and when you do, they usually aren't running the register.   I will keep eating here and I will recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a good sub, especially if you like turkey!!",

He also advised me that he only employs one delivery driver, all orders wait for that one driver to come back from the last round of deliveries. When the driver arrived he said the same thing. My warm sandwiches were cold, my salads were warm and wilted. I threw one of them away without eating it, the lettuce was disgusting. Order from anyone else. This place has bad service and food.

Although it was lunch hour, the shop wasn't crowded, so I had high expectations of the food and service. Unfortunately, my order was misplaced, so it took over 20 minutes to get a turkey and tomato sandwich. More importantly, when I received it, it gave the appearance of something hastily thrown together - where's the love? As I waited, the place got busier, so they clearly have a good following and I'll give them a second try sometime - but not soon. There are a lot of choices in Old Town, and service is King - here it was a mere pauper.",

They brought a chef salad instead of garden and the person who ordered it is a vegetation so she had to go without lunch. They also brought an extra meatball sub, not sure who that was supposed to be for but I guess that means they had at least two angry customers that day. I honestly feel filling food orders is the easiest job in the world, just double check the bag before it leaves, there's no excuse for this type of mistake. I won't be ordering from them again.",

    "text": "I got \"The Bobbie\" after a wedding reception turned into a booze fueled, late night romp through old town. Never tried the sandwich before, but it's the biggest thing on the menu. Has to be good, right? Wrong. To be fair, The guys behind the counter were professional and friendly.  It was a gamble, and a relatively safe one, so I thought. One would think the sandwich that is advertised the most, and largest on the menu, would be the tastiest, and most famous. The Bobbie has a mix of turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. What could go wrong? It IS that time of the year, Sounds delicious. Why does food get famous? Because it is a staple of the area, and the community.  One thing is for certain, the stuffing was as dry as the desert. The cranberry sauce might has well have been pulled straight from an abandoned nuclear bunker, it was dry as fuck like the rest of the sandwich and the entire state.  The turkey...  The turkey might as well have been tuna. Absolutely disgusting.   I'm still drunk as fuck typing this. I have eaten garbage that has tasted better, while i was less drunk than i was tonight. It was on par with leftover mystery chinese gutter trash, but worsr. I even got a second opinion from my party and passed the sandwich to 6 people. This sandwich literally made me question my own sanity. It was almost relieving that EVERYONE thought it was as dry and tasteless as the establishment that created this monstrosity.  Who takes back a fucking sandwich? Me apparently. I understand if a steak is not cooked to your liking, it's an easy mistake in a busy place, I served tables for 4 years. I get it. But a sandwich? Jesus.  The replacement sandwich I received might as well have been a homemade tuna sandwich. I ordered normal turkey. Tis the season. God damn. You would THINK that the cranberry sauce would save it, but no. God damnit. I'm drunk, any food would taste good.  Fuck Capriotti's. I would rather recommend getting your ass pillaged by butt gremlins for an eternity than eating \"The Bobbie\" once.  Complete trash. If you go there, save yourself some time and throw the sandwich in the garbage before you have the unfortunate experience of eating the food.  Fuck.",

So yesterday I went there because I was craving a nice hot sandwich and I love the cherry peppers. When I got there it was like 30 minutes into closing the staff were already put up all the chairs it look like it was no place to order. I was okay with that I know how it is I work in the restaurant industry myself. But the staff was very shady looking. I am all into giving people Second Chances because I am a convict myself. But the staff look like they are still battling drug addiction and criminal activity. So I was eating my sandwich and then I noticed a homeless guy was talking to the staff went to the back and started working. The food was great the service was good but everybody looked it really shady and why was there somebody that's not on payroll in the back. Due to the way that the staff look I will not be going there again.",

I will definitely be back again but hope to return some smiling faces!!!",

    "text": "A place that puts turkey, cranberry sauce and dressing (stuffing for non-southerners) on a crusty bun deserves a 4 star or better rating.   Geesus people that's an insane sandwich.    I had lunch here recently with Rand H, Mike C and Robyn B.  Met Jackie C for the1st time.     For lunch,  I stuck with the \"more of the middle road\" and ordered the Capistrami... Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw.  But instead of having mine on a toasty bun, I had mine with a bit of lettuce in a bowl.  A fantastic bunless sandwich and since this particular sammie is quite the messy one, I'm happy I could eat this one with a fork.  For those who love sandwiches, their's come in 9, 12 and 15 in bun sizes.  Uhm yeah... BIG, HUGE and Gigantic.    I'll definitely return to this place.  I may work up the courage to try the Bobbie, but until then, I'm fine with the Capistrami!",

Unfortunately, I have a gluten-allergy and was not able to eat here, so this review is on behalf of the ones I was with.   First, being located in the heart of Olde-Towne (not sure why the 'e's at the ending of those words are necessary) Scottsdale, this place has an optimal location that makes for a fun lunch and half day trip in town.   I was told that the sandwiches were truly world-class. They come in sizes that go up to 20\" in length. Moreover, they have original and unique sandwich options that utilize fresh ingredients, such as, cranberry sauce and stuffing.   The reason this review is not a 5-star review was due to the fact that the service has room for improvement. It's not that the employees were rude, they just made a few off-colored comments while we were there.   Nonetheless, if your in old town, make sure you give this place a try.",

I'm not sure if I cared for the stuffing or not as I felt everything else on it was just fine as it is. Everything else I did like such as the homemade turkey and the cranberry sauce.  I also tried one of their cold turkey sandwiches as well on another visit. It definitely was not nearly as good as the \"Bobbie\" and immediately knew that I should have gotten that instead. This restaurant does benefit from its location being right in Old Town Scottsdale and I hope they continue to do well.",

Before I was even done filling up my ice tea my salad was ready, at first I thought WOW thats great service! Well its probably because they must have salads pre made in the back. This salad was one of the worst salads Ive had. I could get a pre made salad from Fry's and have better. No lie. I ended up picking out the pieces of blue cheese and eating that and thats it. It had some type of meat on it that was gross. Maybe they should stick with sandwiches. But Im afraid to try one now! On a plus side...my Doritos were good.  And they have a nice variety of iced tea",

I purposefully went more than once because I thought perhaps the first time was just my bad luck. After three visits I realized I had to post a review. The very first time I went, there was a woman behind the counter making sandwiches without her hair tied back. I believe this is against health code. She was also very sweaty no doubt because the entire restaurant was warm. They seemed to not have the air-conditioning on. In Arizona, you need to have the air conditioning on in the summer, especially in a restaurant. The second time I visited, the restaurant was yet again warm and the unclean gentleman who took my order proceeded to make my sandwich without washing his hands after touching the register. This is also against health code. The third time I visited this establishment was the final straw. Upon unwrapping my sandwich at home, I decided not to eat it. The lettuce and tomatoes were wilted and soggy making the sandwich unappealing. I will never visit this place again.  I highly recommend the location by The Walmart super center in north Scottsdale though. That location and its employees are always clean and friendly.",

The service was decent and the inside is large, but ultimately the food was lacking.   I ordered the \"Bobbie\" since that's what they're known for, and it was unbelievably dry (and cold? It felt like it was taken straight out of the fridge). We also ordered two other sandwiches, the cheese steak and the meatball sub. Both were decent (and better than the Bobbie for sure), but still comparable to Subway.   Still, I give this sandwich shop some kudos because it seems like a favorite among locals, and perhaps the \"Bobbie\" is just a polarizing choice - some people love it, some people hate it. I can see why Capriotti's would be a great place to eat after a long day (carbs make everything better), but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there and it's certainly not Scottsdale's best.",

But they did put the Coleslaw on the side.  Screwups happen. As for the sandwich, the pastrami was well seasoned. If you are looking for a True deli sandwich, one piled high with meat, this isn't the place. It's similar to Subway in size. Maybe it's just me but I prefer Deli sandwiches like Jason's Deli....",

I got the Italian sub. Bread was soft and fresh, meat was crispy on the edges from being toasted. I ordered a 7 inch (or 9\"?) but they made a mistake and gave me the large one. The first half was so good I couldn't stop myself from attempting the second half. After 2 bites I realized this thing is mammoth and decided to save it for later. My only disappointed was when I realized I'd have to take it home and defend it from my husband and boys.  Side note: I was in at lunch, it was clean, speedy, friendly, and busy. I also found it interesting that I was the only female there! That's when you know it's a good place! No snotty ladies talking about their wheat free, dairy free, egg free, vegetarian diet restrictions.",

    "text": "I sent a email to their corporate office: To whom it may concern, I am a teacher at Coronado High School in Scottsdale Arizona, today I took my summer school art class on a field trip to visit art galleries in Old Town Scottsdale.  After we were finished we decided to grab lunch at Capriotti's.  There were 16 of us and upon entering the shop the owner, whom I do not remember his name, because I am terrible with names, greeted us and immediately identified me as the ring leader of this motley crew.  It was 110 degrees and we were ready to cool down and have some sandwiches.  The owner quickly instructed us the best way to order to keep the flow of customers moving.  He went out of his way to make sure all of my kids got what they needed, one student he comped a sandwich because he had only ordered a drink.  After everyone had ordered he came by not once but multiple times to check to see if everything was good and if we needed anything else.  He thanked us over and over and told us he loved having us there.  This is not always the case when taking a group of high school kids to lunch.  I am not looking for a free sandwich or anything like that, what I would like is some sort of recognition for the owner of the shop as well as his employees who made it their goal to give my students and myself the best possible service.  I plan on coming back with and without my students in the future and am utterly impressed and amazed by the quality of food and the experience we received.  thanks",

I got the Bobbie- turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo- had them hold the mayo. This is not what I would normally order, but had to try it. I was quite pleasantly surprised. It was outstanding! I thought it would be served hot, but it was cold and I loved it! The fresh, roasted, hand carved turkey is what makes this a winner. It is not sliced, processed deli turkey. The taste of the turkey is wonderful. I wish I lived here as this would be a regular stop for me. I got the \"Capture 2\" that includes your choice of half a sub, salad and soup. I chose the balsamic chicken salad to go with my Bobbie and the salad was wonderful also. Service was fast. The price was also really good for the amount of food I received. Very generous salad and a half sub was more than enough for lunch. I highly recommend it!",

Its thanksgiving on a bun and it kicks ass. Then the bread is fresh and really good too.  Now truth me told this thing is the densist sandwich you will ever eat.

I have no doubt the other options are delicious and someday soon I will try something else.  I am very happy to see this brand new Capriotti's in Old Town Scottsdale, and once you have eaten there you will be happy too! Oh yeah this is a combo location; Everything Bagel's is in the same location and they serving homemade bagels and noshes, they are open at 6am M-F and 7am on Sat & Sun so breakfast can be had if you get there too early for a Capriotti's sandwich.",

I had heard that they cook their turkey fresh and they absolutely do. I took a bite of my sandwich and it was real turkey meat, I even got a small bone in one of the first few bites. The coleslaw is a bit flavorless, but OK. I do not think I would order this sandwich again, but i will be back to try their cheesesteak.   They deliver within a two mile radius...  It's A-OK.",

I love Capriotti's and was so excited that a new location opened up in Old Town a few months ago. The service is always friendly, and everyone seems happy to be there!   I've tried every one of the vegetarian selections. My favorite has to be the Veggie Turkey Cole. So, so delicious. Coleslaw and Russian dressing (which I must say is the only time I've had this kind of dressing)? SOLD. The prices are a little more expensive than other chain sub places, however a small is a whopping 9 inches. It's definitely enough to fill you up. The ingredients always taste fresh.   I also like how this is connected to an Everything Bagels, although I have yet to try them.   As with my last review, I really wish they would get a veggie version of The Bobbie already!

I originally got hooked on \"The Bobbie,\" which is Thanksgiving dinner in a roll of bread. At my most recent visit, however, I decided to venture out from my original fav and got the \"Slaw-be-Joe.\" I was not disappointed!

I guess we can say thus far, I've have Capriotti's once a week for the last month.  Writing that out and reading that out loud sorta makes me feel bad at the thought of having a sub once a week.  I know better but I just can't help it.  It's that damn good!    On my first visit, I tried the Capastrami.  Man, that sandwich is everything it says it is.  Acclaimed best seller I'm sure, it's warm, the Russian dressing and coleslaw is out of this world!  I knew I was making the right decision when a couple behind me order 2 of them in the medium sizes.  I ordered mine in small.  My second visit I tried the Cheese Steak Sub.  This was the best Cheese Steak sub I've had in Phoenix.  Reminded me so much of the Cheese Steaks we have back East.  The hot peppers, the mayo, the cheese.  It was divine!    Today was my third visit.  I'm eating as I type this.  This time I tried the Grilled Italian Sub.  It's good, interested for sure.  I've never had an Italian Sub taste like this, then again, I've never had it Grilled.  I assumed it was going to be a regular Italian sub, toasted.  This was a little different and it had fried onions on it!  Definitely a different taste but one I would try again.  For the third time in 3 weeks, I was thoroughly satisfied.  I've been winning with every sub I picked up, I'm gonna keep this party going.  Next time I think I'm going to try a regular Italian sub or the cold turkey sub.",

I would always get the large cheese steaks and there would be times I could not finish it.   I have to say coming back I am throughly disappointed on the sandwich. It still had the same great taste but it was a lot of bread. I don't know if sandwich shops now are getting short with there meat but I have noticed it a lot and not just here. The customer service was great, food was great but if you plan on paying over $10 for a large sub, I would expect a lot more meat. I probably won't be back unless the sandwich's change, due to paying a lot of a little.   Hope this helps!",

I have walked up to the door (also between 6 and 6:30pm) when the open sign is on, hours clearly posted confirming they should be open, only to find the door locked and the employees ignoring anyone outside. Many times I've found a dark, locked restaurant when Yelp, Google and the Capriotti's website says this location should be open. I give up.

Their subs are always flush with flavorful toppings and encased in a fresh bread shell, unlike Jimmy Johns. Whenever I've visited their Old Town location, the lines are typically 2-3 customers long but I never wait more than five minutes for a meal to come out. If I had to register a minor quibble, it would be how they arrange toppings is sometimes inconsistent and you don't get a overall impression of the flavors. However, to give a measurement on how good the sandwiches are, whenever I go I always fret with eating only half a sandwich and usually eat the whole thing.",

Today I decided to take an out of state collegue here after I spoke highly of the place.  We got there, and not too many people were there, so we got there just in time.  We ordered our sandwiches. Hers pretty much came out right away, while mine still didn't arrive after 10-15 minutes. I noticed the people that came in after us getting their food.  I decided to check at the counter and make sure they didn't lose my order.  I was told, no, they had a large phone order that came in right before I ordered.  I wasn't sure how this could be accurate considering those after me already received their orders. After 7 more minutes passed my food finally appears and I was told \"ooops, they did lose your order\".  I open it and the sandwich was obviously thrown together.  it had tomatoes on it, that I specifically requested not to have.  It did not have the mayo and pickles I requested and it was very dry (due to no condiments).  I was embarrassed that I bragged about capriotti's and my guest and I experienced this.  We were also late coming back from lunch because of this ordeal.",

    "text": "I am Delaware girl, living in Denver, and I was visiting Scottsdale. When I saw there was a Capriotti's around town, I HAD to bring some back for my family in Denver.  All of this is important because, Capriotti's originated in Delaware (been eating it my whole life) and there are no Capriotti's in Denver...yet. In short, I have been eating there since way before it was franchised.   So has the quality of Capriotti's gone down since a massive franchising? Hopefully and sadly it may be a case-by-case basis per location.  With nerves and excitement I ordered a cheesesteak, Italian hoagie, and a Bobbie to fly back to Denver with.  I will preface this next bit with what a Bobbie is...pulled turkey, tangy cranberry sauce, stuffing and a little mayo...Thanksgiving all year round in a sandwich/sub/hoagie.   I broke into the Bobbie while waiting at the airport, and dry stuffing, more like croutons fell out of the top of the sandwich....Last I checked stuffing is supposed to be served soft, warm and tasty, even in a Bobbie...  So, it seems like a Capriotti's employee did a shaky shaky of dry bagged stuffing into my Bobbie... America's #1 sandwich... I hope the Denver location is more on point when it opens...  Aside from that, my Dad said the cheesesteak was great.",

We studied the menu for a while and were never rushed or pressured to hurry up (even though they were busy). The gal who took our order was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful; she even gave me a free birthday sandwich! The prices are a bit hefty, but once you realize the quality of food and the portion sizes you can easily see it's a great deal. We got two chopped salads and a Rueben sandwich to go. While waiting for our food we sat down and noticed that the inside environment is deli like and inviting. They have clean and comfortable tables with a large screen tv to enjoy watching games or whatever. Our order was up quickly and everyone wished me a happy birthday (unbelievably nice staff who enjoy their jobs). We dug into our meals when we got home and were all delighted with how fresh and delicious everything tasted. The Rueben was huge and filled with meat; the coleslaw and sauce inside were perfect. The salads were filled with fresh veggies and crisp lettuce, and the dressing was spot on.  If you want a great sandwich or salad of any kind I suggest you head here. Not only will you get a solid meal, but you'll also be greeted with a smile and it'll make your day better. We will be back time and time again!",

There were only 6 customers in the restaurant, and when I arrived they hadn't even begun my order.  They only had 2 employees working on a Saturday night.....one cook and one cashier.....both overwhelmed. Just embarrassingly pathetic service.  My order finally finished in another 25 minutes, and then they left one item out of the carry out bag.  The cashier looked shell shocked....no apologies....and just gave me a blank stare.  As previously mentioned, their kitchen looked like it wouldn't have passed a health department check. If having just 2 employees working on the busiest night of the week is any indication, it tells you how highly the owner/manager regards his customers.  As for the level of the cuisine, just barely above Subway quality....but don't look at the kitchen, or you won't want to eat it.  (Also concur with the lack of parking comments.....almost non-existent)",

Great interior: TV's, a chronology of the history of  Capriottis, nicely arranged.  Lots of choices on the board. I ordered a Veggie Cole Turkey, vegetarian turkey with cole slaw. I asked Davianna if the sandwich included onions and she said no. I received my sandwich, nicely wrapped and taped.  Went back to my vehicle and dug in. To my disappointment, not only was the sandwich not vegan turkey, there was no cole slaw and plenty of onions. So I returned and explained, with my receipt, that the order was wrong. To their credit, they apologized, offered me a free upgrade and made me what I wanted originally.  After the frustration of feeling that they just didn't pay attention when I ordered, I tried the sandwich and it was excellent.  Cole slaw was perfect and the vegan turkey was tasty.  And no onions this time. :)  Without the trouble, I probably would have given it a 4+.  I will definitely try this franchise again.",

    "text": "If I were rating based simply on taste of the food, I would be rating a four, but, unfortunately, that's not the case.  Yes, the food is good, particularly the steak and cheese and the Capistrami.  However, the subs seem to be getting smaller every time I order.  I am a 5'2 girl.  I can't come close to eating a 9\" sub anywhere else, but I did today.  The sub rolls may be 9\" long, but they aren't even 3\" wide!  I could probably even overlook that, though, if the service was better.  Every time I've been in the actual store, the people behind the counter always seem more interested in talking to each other rather than taking care of the customers.  I haven't been in there in a while, so maybe that's changed, but that was the case on more than one occasion.  My delivery service today, however, was atrocious.  It took over an hour and a half, and I live less than 1/2 mile from the store.  I called after almost an hour and was told that the delivery guy had left 20 minutes ago.  Then I called another 20 minutes later and spoke to the manager.  He would barely let me finish a sentence and kept just saying that there was only one driver and they had a lot of orders.  If I'd been told when I ordered that it would be a long wait, that would have been one thing.  But I was told it would take 40 minutes, and it took over twice that amount of time.  He offered me a free sandwich next time, but that really doesn't make up for such poor customer service.",

So here is the good news first: The customer service in this place is AWESOME!  The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and can make recommendations on the spot.  The owner was so friendly and happy to talk to us since it was our first time in the shop.  He joked with us at the end of our meal also when we asked to take the rest home.  A fairly young and hip team who seemed very excited to hand you your order which I found refreshing since I am usually a Subway person.  Now for the not so good news:  We tried the Capastrami sandwich after reading what sounded like an awesome description on the menu board.  Now I like a great pastrami with coleslaw and some sort of dressing, but this thing was SATURATED in mayo.  Between the overly dressed coleslaw and the Russian dressing, it was just too over powering for what was actually really good pastrami.  The bread was really good, so it was sad to have such a drenched sandwich.  Next time I will take the advice of the owner and try their famous \"Bobbie Sub\" which looks like Thanksgiving dinner on a sub.",

The couple didn't really care about it they just went along with it!  Anyway it was my turn so  I let the cashier know that I was redeeming my free sub and handed him my phone to show him. So he looked at it and and touched the redeem button...took him two tries because he didn't do it right the first time. But there is another window that pops up saying \"are you sure you want to redeem yes or no \" so you have to hit yes to proceed, he didn't do it so I saw it and did it for him I am an honest guy. Then the cashier very rudely and waving his hands with a rushing motion said to be come on come on make your phone redeem that!  So I showed him my phone and I said I did here look!  He saw it, then I called him out on what he just did. I told him to calm down that I did it for him and that he doesn't need to be rude about it. I said change your attitude and give good customer service!  He was starting to say that the store was his and he that he knew what customer service was. I said no you don't take your sandwich and you know the rest!  I will never go back and I will let everyone I know about it. You should never treat a regular or any other customer that way.

I've heard they're known for the Bobbie, which is a Thanksgiving meal in a sandwich, but I went for the chipotle chicken.   I love alot of textures in my sandwich and this was satisfying! The chicken was sort of shaved, like you'd find in a shawarma, and flavored well. On top sat a bed of crispy onions, drizzled with the chipotle sauce. The bun it sat in was nice and soft but still able to carry the weight of the sandwich.   Great textures, and flavors and pretty filling sandwich. Its a solid option for a quick meal",

    "text": "By far the rudest customer service interaction I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.   I tried to call in and place an order for a few sandwiches, which I have done before even at this very same location, and I was met with a rude representative from Capriotti's loudly exclaiming they have a website to order their food from. I say okay, I didn't know that, and asked if I could still call in two sandwiches really quickly since I'm already on the phone and don't want to hang up and look their website up and order from there. All I hear is rude scoffing from this person to what seems like himself or a co-worker, and a muttering of \"unbelievable\". I hung up the phone, and ordered food from somewhere else.   Not that it makes any difference, but my order would have been a Bobbie and Cheese Steak sandwich. No sides or extra toppings, an incredibly easy order to take that is completely off their menu, probably a few buttons to press into the register, without any necessity of being rude or impolite. Capriotti's sandwiches are great though. Their classic the Bobbie is delicious, like a huge sandwich made from Thanksgiving leftovers, and great any time of the year. The Cheese Steak is also one of my favorite with peppers and onions.   If you want a good sandwich, go to Capriotti's, but if you want a decent customer service experience, avoid this location at all costs. If you can't talk to customers without being rude and impolite, work in a different industry. Not every customer is aware of every restaurant's website/app/whatever, and not every person wants to figure it out for every single establishment they patronize.",

One was great tasting and plentiful. The other barely had any turkey at all. I asked for little onion which I guess for them means none. The cashier Rob (who looked like the owner) asked me if I wanted chips.  I said no and wow he charged me for them anyway.  I can't vouch for the second sandwich cause there was barely any meat at all. So I guess I paid $10 for bread and 2 slices of cheese and brown lettuce.   There are plenty of other places to spend your money, just not here.",

I have had my eye on this place for a while and thought it would be fun to try. Though the whole experience was a bit disappointing.  The place was pretty quiet as we were the only ones in the restaurant. We placed our orders and went to go sit down. Every single table was dirty and covered in crumbs, along with trash on the floor. I wondered why no one cleaned the area since there were 3 people working behind the counter and seemed to be hanging around.  The food: I love a good Philly Cheesesteak and was super excited. They use provolone cheese which is not the traditional but provolone is always a good choice. My sandwich arrived and I was thoroughly disappointed. Most of the meat was burnt, super chewy and it just ruined the sandwich. The bread was okay but I wasn't a big fan. My husband enjoyed his but I was super disappointed in the whole experience.   Pretty limited parking on the weekends and the bathroom is located outside the restaurant so the cleanliness is a 50/50 gamble. Maybe their other food is better but I don't think the sign lived up to its name.",

The sign outside said \"World's Greatest Sandwich\".   I got a small (9\") Cheesesteak and a large drink for $11.96 but it was the most expensive sandwich on the menu. My lunch arrived in 5 mins.   It had soft bread with just enough chew and really fresh taste. There was plenty of meat on the sandwich and the cheese was thoroughly melted. A really good cheesesteak.   The menu offered salads, Italian dishes, several turkey sandwiches, vegetarian, 20 smoothie combos. There were several award plaques for 'Best of...\" all over the front counter.   I've been driving past this place for years but now I have a go-to for a good cheesesteak.   Came back later in the week and tried the meatball sandwich. It was still a pretty big meal.   It came with provolone, four meatballs, marinara and Parmesan. The bread was just pillowy enough to keep it all together. I'd order it again.",

    "text": "This downtown Scottsdale Capriotti's shares a suite with Healthy Shake, another place for me to try! The shop is clean, with a handful of tables on the west side.  The staff is friendly, and the service fast. (3) sandwiches took no time at all, which is great when you're packing a quick lunch into your work day. In this order was one Bobbie, one Cole, and one roast beef sub. The small is huge! You can take half home. Thia place is definitely not cheap though. The (3) small subs with chips and drinks was 40 bucks! ($38 and change)  The Bobbie: Thanksgiving on a bun. Turkey, stuffing, cheese and cranberry sauce. A favorite! The bread was spongy and fresh.  The Cole: Turkey with Cole slaw, cheese and Russian dressing. I ended up switching half of my Bobbie with half of this sub with my co-worker. So glad I took the plunge. This sandwich was super tasty.  Roast beef. A co-worker got this plain sammy with no tomato or onion. I agree with the onion,  because that's Satan's apple. But no tomato? C'mon man! He said that his sub was dry, and needed to add more vinegar and oil. I told him is he had a juicy tomato, he wouldn't have that problem!  Now that I've talked about the sub goodness, let me tell you about the weird tunage. The music in here had me confused. I don't know if it was the Christian radio station or what, but I felt like Kirk Cameron was going to jump out and clean my table when we were done. First there was a song that just sang \"Coney Island\" over and over. The next songs were very strange and uplifting. These were also on blast...super loud!   All in all, Capriotti's is awesome. The sandwiches are worth the sporadic splurge.",

SO, my husband mentioned Capriotti's and how they have REAL pulled turkey on their sandwiches, not the processed slices. Yes, please! We decided to make a visit so that I could get my turkey sandwich fix.   I have been a few times in the past (different locations) and ordered the Cole + liked it so that is what I went with again! NOTE: Their small sandwich is still LARGE! I believe it was about 9 inches. More than enough for one person! The Cole has their roasted turkey, coleslaw, provolone cheese, thousand island dressing, and mayo. I had a feeling it would be pretty saucy so ordered light on the mayo and dressing, however, I don't think they got the memo because I was basically eating mouth fulls of mayo and dressing when it came. We were hungry so I didn't send it back but it was honestly so gloppy with sauce. The flavor of the sandwich is great but next time I would ask for both mayo AND the dressing on the side because it is just too risky otherwise.   I went to get soda from the machine and it had a rotten egg flavor - GROSS! So I dumped it out and went ahead and got iced tea instead.   This location doesn't have a ton of seating and the tables are VERY close together! It wasn't the most comfortable so i'd probably get it to-go next time as well. However, it is worth noting that the employees here were VERY nice!!",

We are locals looking for a decent sandwich on Saturday afternoon.  We stood by the counter and waited and waited and waited.  My friend who has a sense of humor asked:  \"is it that we are too short for you to see us?\"   They had seen us alright.  They saw us walk in.  Some young lady mumbled that HE would take care of us.  Well, HE never moved a muscle and kept doing what he was doing.  I asked \"Will HE help us TODAY?\"   With that, she made a face and went to the cash register to ask me what I wanted.  Not friendly at all, Guadalupe.   You could have apologized and we probably would have been OK with it.  But no, you had to make a face of disgust.  As if customers were interrupting your daily routine.  Thinking of a facial between sandwiches, perhaps?   We went across the street until it was ready and by the time we got back in 10 minutes it was ready.  I don't understand why businesses in tourist areas such as this one (OLD TOWN) don't care about customer service.  Humor me.  When I walk in say hello and say give us a few minutes because we have several orders ahead of you.  That gives me the expectation that my order will not be ready as soon as I would like it to be.  At least, I WOULD KNOW.  Not standing there for minutes on end wondering if you even know we were waiting.   I feel badly for the owner as this place will survive only on tourist fumes.  He would do much better if locals were happy as well.   Unless, of course, the owner is running the place himself and he knows what's going on.",

Quality was markedly worse than every Las Vegas location to which I have ever been.  Confused as to how different the food experience can be across a state line. Regardless, don't think I'm willing to give AZ Cap's another chance...",

Seriously, comparing this place to Subway isn't a True apples to apples comparison.  I love it because it reminds me of a deli I went to a great deal in New York City.   They don't skimp on the meat like other places and the employees are always in a good mood.",

    "text": "I know I'm going to get crap for this but, oh well here goes... Starving, I go out into the vicious sauna that is Scottsdale in monsoon season, seeking food on a Sunday afternoon. After a couple of \"closed on Sunday\" disappointments, I decided to go slumming at the always-disappointing Schlotskys Deli on Scottsdale. Lo and behold, shiny new Capriottis and Everything Bagel swooped in to save the neighborhood.  Yay... No wait, hold my calls, I'm not done. I walk in and the place is about 85* in the restaurant... Yuck. I walk up to the register to order and asked the very pregnant sweating girl how long ago did they take over Schlotskys.  She rolled her eyes, looked down, and said \"2 months, what would you like to order?\"  I ordered. Then she asked for my name to tag my order.  I told her my name.  Another giant eye roll and a (fuck it, who cares) shrug. She says \"I can't spell\".  Because I don't normally care whether my name is spelled or pronounced correctly, even though, on this very rare occasion, I had pronounced it phonetically for her, I just blew it off. But then, right on the cash register screen facing me, was her spelling... \"corney\".  I laughed. She scoffed... \"What?\" She says. \"I'm just laughing at how you spelled my name.\" Then she smirks and says \"it works.\" And walked away without even looking at me. OK, kinda snotty. I walk down to where the food comes out, and the young dude making my sandwich is also sweating (no kidding)  and wiping the sweat off with the back of his wrist.  Whatever... it's Scottsdale. The other kid working was on his lunch break. I could tell that by how he blew past me full speed, across the store, clumsily juggling a plastic cup and skidded 3 feet to a stop in front of an available table to eat at, and plopped his ass down. I hope he chose something caffeine free.  Look, I know they're young, I know it's hot here, I know other guy is a spaz, I know she's pregnant, I can even surmise that she may not like her job, life, self... None of those things negate the fact that you (said employees) went out and got yourself a job in the food service industry... Serving others, food. Part of service is being polite. Another part is being professional. Where the f are the adults to corral these youngsters and teach them how to represent your business? Shame on you.  Oh, the sandwich was fantastic! Thank you, sweaty tall kid.",

Ordered the Capastrami, medium with chips and a drink. $12 and change. I could literally hear my wallet mumble something about being America's greatest this or that but I paid it no mind.   The sub was fairly large in stature but slim in flavor. Maybe it's because I'm from the East Coast and know what pastrami is supposed to taste like or maybe it's just because I like my food seasoned. .. I dunno but I think this time my wallet was right. The food was a bit pricy for what you get.   Next time I'm walking the extra 50 feet and going to JJ's.",

It was as if you took a week old left over DRY thanksgiving turkey and shredded it up and stuffed it on a roll. It was a combo of white and dark meat as well as the bones (I had three bones in my small size sandwich). The chopped hot peppers were good though and by far the best part of the sandwich. Also, the guy ringing up my order was texting during the ring up process. Lastly, my sandwich was given to someone else, she opened it and returned it to the counter. The worker just rewrapped it then called my name and gave it to me. I was in somewhat of a hurry so didn't want to ask them to remake it but still didn't seem very professional. Maybe I would go back and try something different but doubt it. My first experience just wasn't good.",

It was only after my 3rd visit that I got  pickle chips on a sandwich and I have to say they were the best Pickle I have yet to try in al my nearly 5 decades here on earth!   The Sandwich I had yesterday was weird though tasty, I kinda thought they made a mistake and gave me tuna. It was THE TURKEY,The Turkey meat was in shreds and very wet, that with the pickles, peppers, mustard, mayo and vegies It was a conundrum.  I wanted the same sandwich I had a few days prior but I didn't recognize it on the menu, I now know it was THE ITALIAN. This sandwich is so fresh with great meats and fresh toppings it was a winner and I was both Happy and Sad I had to share it with a hungry coworker.  My first impression last week on my first visit, I had the CAPISTRAMI, It was highly recommended by the cashier and although I have never wanted to order a Ruben, I must say the sandwich was a solid 9 out of 10.  I love the location of this new Capriotties, It's a very welcome addition of fast casual restaurants that scatter the area I work in. Americas Taco Shop, Qudoba, Paradise Bakery are weak options and I almost would rather go hungry. That problem is solved with Capriotties now in the hood.  What needs work are the side options, as of now only chips, I hope they work on that!   What doesn't need work is the sandwiches and Ultra helpful, professional, and extra friendly staff.  Welcome to Old Town CAPRIOTTIES!!!!! Keep up The Great work!!!!!",

I stopped in here because they didn't seem to busy and a cold sandwich sounded good. When I walked in I was the 3rd person in line and the gal taking orders started to get anxious with the older gentleman ordering. By the time I got to the counter there was about 4 people behind me. She was still very nice taking my order but very rushed.   About 10-15 mins after placing my order the rude guy making the sandwiches yelled my name and basically tossed my sandwich tray on the counter in my general direction. Uhhhh...rude.   The seating area itself was cramped for space (which is fine) but the tables were all sticky and had garbage littered all over the place. After seeing that I was turned off at the idea of eating there. I went back up to Mr. Sandwich thrower and asked for a to-go bag. He rolled his eyes at me and handed me a brown bag. Wow. I am so sorry to inconvenience you, jerk face.  I won't be back. Ill just go to a Subway. At least they serve a crap sandwich with a smile and hold the attitude!",

Quality of meat was excellent! So flavorful! Chicken noodle so good. Smoothies are so healthy and light.

The sandwiches are ok but the biggest problem was that the place was just FILTHY!  It felt like the owners have completely abandoned their restaurant.    After we ordered our sandwiches and were waiting to be called - we sat watching an employee throwing bags of ice on the absolutely disgusting floor over and over and over and over again - to break up the ice - and then pouring the bag into the ice machine.  Really gross!  Those bags are not tear proof.  They get little holes in the bag from the ice when you do that.  And then - when they poured the bag into the machine the bags were going into the machine.  It was really very unsanitary!  And the employee seemed really angry - pushing and slamming chairs.  It was uncomfortable.  There were crumbs and pieces of food all over the tables and on the floors.  The tables and floors felt sticky and grimey.  Nothing had been cleaned, swept, etc.  We had to wipe down a table and the chairs - to sit and eat.   I asked for something to wrap the rest of my sandwich up, I was handed paper with sauce and pieces of meat stuck to it.  At that point, I didn't even want the rest of my sandwich.  It felt like the type of place where - if an employee dropped a piece of bread or meat on the floor - they wouldn't think anything of still using it on a customer's sandwich.    It's a shame, we really wanted to like this place.",

As I was ordering, I got a call back and was thanked for going online to order as they are trying to make a push for customers to order online rather than call in. I was told they would throw in some free cookies as a thank you. I thought that was very nice and hung up happy.  I finish my online order.  Left comments for a few of the orders - but nothing major or super picky - simply asked for a couple salad toppings on the side. I tried to complete my order and the website claimed they didn't deliver to my area.  So, I have to call back again and the person on the phone says to make it as pick up and they would deliver.  Ok, great.   Our delivery gets here and it's completely disappointing.  Of the 6 orders, only 2 are correct and there were no extra cookies, napkins or silverware!  Three of the salads were missing dressing and one of the salads was the wrong dressing. I called and told the same person I've been talking to this whole time that we were missing dressings and there were no cookies.  He told me he included cookie coupons....why would I want a cookie coupon and not the actual cookie???  I was told they would bring the dressings as soon as they could...which they did pretty timely, however one was still missing!    I've eaten at the restaurant before and LOVED the food and had great service, but this is just not acceptable. Terrible service and we will NOT be ordering delivery/catering from them again.",

Their home-roasted turkey and their homemade meatballs were delicious. AND the protein shakes taste like milkshakes. Heaven. Will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "This joint has been on my \"to try\" list for a few years... sadly, it was underwhelming.  We got a couple different footlongs to share and try: the Italian sausage & the Philly.  While the Philly was better than average, the Italian sausage was disappointing to say the least.  Our order was take out, around lunch time and since we only live five minutes away I felt we truly gave it a fair shot.  Would the Italian have been better if they had packed the marinara sauce to dunk it in / pour over it?  Probably... but that point is moot since they forgot.  The bread did not taste fresh, despite a lunch order on a Friday, and when I was there the service was less than stellar.  If I ever give it another shot, I'll try the Thanksgiving sando due to the rave reviews from peeps I trust, but who knows if that will ever happen.",

    "text": "Their meatball sub was average. Their cheese steak isnt bad, id eat that again at a different location. So why the low rating? Well, this place is filthy. They dont clean their tables. I saw a guy that worked their, walk around to push chairs in, but didnt clean anything off tables except for a napkin. Floors were just as dirty. On top of that, they have a blue light right above the coffee maker that has a lot of dead bugs on it.",
