What the chef whipped up that night was absolutely INSANE. Unless you have a major dietary restriction, trust the way the item is listed on the menu. Can't wait for football season to start so we have a place to hang with great beer and fun bartender!",

While they have great burgers, wings and an awesome selection of beer and whisky, their brunch is what makes this place so great.  If you are in the area, are looking for something new to try or are just curious to try the best egg Benedict on the planet, do yourself a favor and stop by.  Please be aware, this is not your typical Scottsdale, drunken, d-bag brunch spot so go there if you want to have a great meal with good company.  Very cute interior.  Staff is always nice and attentive.  They do a bloody mary bar and have a great selection of mimosas if that's your poison.  Oh, and the shrimp mac-and-cheese is a must!",

Food was good, service attentive, good portion size. Hamburger & turkey burger was excellent. Pricing a bit high for this type of restaurant. Lots of TV's if that's your thing.  Place was overly noisy so much so that there was no way to have any semblance of a conversation in our party of 4. (-1*).  I guess I am a slow eater or had the largest portion. Our friends plates were cleared very quickly and then I looked down to find my plate was gone as well... well before I was done eating!!! (-1*) Overall I would recommend this place if you don't mind the poor acoustics. May be better if you are sitting outside.",

Full of crab, moist yet crispy outer crust and nicely accented with light scallion and aioli. As the name suggests, even wines were available on tap, choices were excellent $8 per glass even for happy hour though.  We tried the clam chowder, highly recommended! Not too thick with rich flavor and lightly herbed. Even contained two fresh clams steamed open but still contained lots of chopped clams and bacon. The walleye fish fry was good, wish the fish pieces were bigger though. Contained four pieces but were a bit thin with a heavier doughy crust than preferred...the fish itself was fresh and cooked perfectly. My wife had the sliders which initially arrived a little overcooked and dry but was immediately recognized by the server and replaced with fresh sliders which were much more appetizing.   Overall, we truly enjoyed our first visit to this establishment and look forward to returning. Enjoy!",

So I took to the Yelp community to find a place in Scottsdale for my crew of 6 to eat...the Tap House Kitchen was highly rated. Last night we were looking for a low key option with hardy food, beer and a patio since the weather was superb!  While the service was great all evening and the atmosphere was relaxing, we were all underwhelmed by the food- steak, burgers, and the short rib special. Everything lacked flavor but we were hungry so we ate most of it anyway.  I gave it 3 stars to challenge the \"chef\" to kick up the flavor....that would make the THK top notch and worthy of 5 stars!",

The actually charged us $2.50 for 3 pieces of stale bread.

We were  seated by an experienced waiter who took our order. He then told us that a new waitress would be taking over. We repeated our order and asked them, up front, to give the two couples separate checks. They said that was not a problem. The other couple suggested that perhaps it would help to keep the orders separate from the start. The waitress said that was not necessary. Now we are not used to going over our bills in detail, but the bill presented to the other couple was so high we were puzzled. Guess what? They billed $100 for less than $50 worth of food/drink. And it took two attempts to get it fixed.  Worse, I went and mentioned the problem to the manager.  I did not ask for any concession or \"freebies\", but did suggest that he go and speak to the couple who had been overcharged.  I  then observed the manager during the rest of our time at THK. He was either talking/joking with staff or expediting food orders. THK was about 30% full so it was not that he was in a rush.  He  did whiz by our table once to drop off a food item, but said not a word to anyone.  I might give THK one more try...but I will sit at the bar.",

In house prepared, organic spices and ingredients with lots of flavor and variety.If you're not into keeping things real or your nose is too far up in the air to appreciate good food and drink then this is not the place for you. The lamb chops are phenomenal. The dining area seating could be a little more comfortable and the space could use some acoustic panels to tone down the noise when the the place is packed with happy patrons. Great beer and wine selection. Try the margarita. Love the pairing suggestions and daily menu specials. Daily Happy Hour 3-6.",

    "text": "Sat at the bar on Wednesday night - decent beer selection, nice atmosphere.  Ordered the halibut special.  It was an incredibly small piece - roughly 2 inches square - with no sides (served over a sort of tomato coulis).  Worse than the portion size was the fact that whatever seasoning they put on top was sooo salty, it completely overpowered the delicate halibut and all I tasted was salt.  I let the bartender/server know about it, but got little response.  Then came the bill:   $35 for the halibut.  Are you kidding me  --  this is not the Ocean Club or Eddie V's!   I again complained to the bartender/server about the portion size, the poor preparation due to the over-seasoning and the exorbitant price.  She said she would check with her manager.  When she returned to the bar area she just resumed what she was doing without saying anything to me.  I called her over and asked her if she had talked to the manager.  Yes, she had.  Well, what did he say?  He said that if you want to ask for him to come over, he would come over to talk to me.  Really?!?  At no time did the manager come over, offer any apologies or explanation or even acknowledge that he had an unhappy customer.    Poor service.   Poor food preparation.  Exorbitant price.  Horrible management.",

    "text": "This place has a pretty neat atmosphere and a closed in patio that I really love.  I really like when the patio is open because then it isn't as loud in the restaurant.  The food is pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  I usually try something new each time, and I've been slightly disappointed most times, but I really like their salads.  The service is good, I've never had to wait too long to be helped, and I feel like their servers are really on their toes and aware of the needs of their tables.  The tap selection is really awesome, I like how many different beers they have on tap, and they seem to change on a regular basis.  The wine on tap is a great feature as well when you're feeling a little more fancy!  Another nice thing about TapHouse is that you can make reservations, so if you're going out with a group and you don't want to wait, they can accommodate you.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the direct area looking for an easy place to eat without much of a wait of any.  If you're looking for great food however, I would recommend somewhere closer to Old Town.",

So breakdown:  1 - couldn't sit where we wanted to even though the entire place was open.  2 - our server was extremely rude and not familiar with any of the dishes, recommendations, or menu.   3 - manager delivered food and his interactions was more than rude, \"watch it this is hot,\" after he reached over my 77 year old mother.   4 - we cleared our own dirty dishes by moving them to the next table because everyone passed them up.  Now, on to the food:  1 - eggs Benedict rated a 4/5  2 - fish and chips a 3/5  3 - Mac and cheese with shrimp 1/5  4 - lamb chops .5 out of 5! Over cooked!!!  5 - chicken dumplings - PRE-MADE and definitely microwaved!!!  Gordon Ramsey would have a fit.   First time there.  Will not come back.    If I had to describe in 3 words:  1 - FOCUS IS WRONG is on location and capture of organic growth not quality  2 - STAFF IS RUDE   3 - CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BELOW 1 star   Oh; and you pay for something that is less than its worth.    There's lots of restaurants that are more than one star.  Seek it out, this place is a PASS!!!!",

We came upon the Taphouse kitchen, and first thing we encountered was a Bloody Mary bar with a plethora if ingredients for the actual drink and your olives. They had beef jerky (interesting), traditional olives, barbecue meat, and my favorite song was spam (or at least it looked like it).   After browsing the drinks, we saw they had about 20 different beers on draft from throughout the country. I was missing San Diego, so I got a Ballast Point Sculpin. What was really cool was the variety of wines and they also had Makers Mark and Jameson on tap!   On the menu I was ready to crush, so I was pleased to see a simple but excellent menu, the chicken dumplings looked good but I had to go for the burger. Another sweet thing was that they had beer and wine pairings for each menu item which really helped. Anyways, the burger came out and oh man, amazing! Bacon came in the form of bits, it didn't have onion it had shallot (good change up), and the patty was perfectly done and delicious. My dad got the turkey burger and he doesn't always have the biggest appetite but he demolished it all, I was proud!!   Next time I will get the Bloody Mary bar for sure, enjoy your time there!",

I was quickly seated by the hostess and within 5 minutes had another nice lady greeting me and taking my drink order.  I opted for a flight of their local AZ brewed beers.  They were delivered quickly.  I went with the Arizona Hwy option.  If you prefer American Pilsner type beer I recommend this.  You get four 4 oz. offerings. Served in the cutest little mugs.  LOL. Two had a nice citrus tone to it that reminded me of Blue Moon.  I was not overly hungry so ordered an appetizer.  Tater Tots.  It arrived fairly quickly and was different that what I was expecting.  I was expecting a mound of tiny tater tots covered in cheese, bacon, etc.  what I received were 5 tater tots.  Not tiny little tots but jumbo sized tots on a rectangular dish that had a very nice presentation to it.  They had bacon, chives, a little cheese and some white sauce (a variation of ranch or something). They were so good.  Much better than just a mound of tots.  The waitress was very attentive always swinging bye and seeing if I needed anything.  So. I can't speak for the rest of the menu or main entrees,  but the beer and tots were great!  Also a very friendly staff and just overall nice atmosphere.  I would definitely go back again if I am ever in the area.",

The  chocolate peanut butter pie was as great as you can imagine (add toffee crumble while you are imagining so you get it right).  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was our waitress Haley(sp?). She was spot on with being attentive but not intrusive. Could not have done better.   Definitely check this place out when in the area.",

Oh yeah, the salmon is delicious as well. I can't really comment on drinks I usually have wine. They have plenty to choose from. I think they even have whiskey on tap. I will continue to go it's easy to access in terms of parking and never too crowded but always a good crowd. It's a little pricey for the menu but not too bad. I will continue to go. It's solid.",

The hostess was kinda meh, didn't greet us when we came in and honestly seemed like she didn't want to be there. The food and our waitress made up for that though! I had the sliders off the appetizer menu and I was absolutely blown away! They're topped with quails eggs and a sauce they make in house. It's really delicious, one of the best things I've ever had!

The meat was literally fall apart tender and mouth-watering tasty - oh my. And then, as if we hadn't had enough to put us into a food coma, we ordered desserts - Bread Pudding and a Key Lime Tart!  Short of licking the plates clean, we consumed every single sweet bite. It was a meal that none of us will soon forget.   One final note: Our server, Timothy, was on top of his game.

It did not get all thick and clunky as we ate. The flavor was spot on! We had the pleasure of meeting two of the owners, one being the chef.  After discussing the menu he recommended the lamb pops. My mom does not like lamb, but he brought us a taste anyway. She was won over for sure! They were absolutely perfect. His favorite dish is the Chicken and Dumplings so of course we had to try that as well. We split the order. The dumplings are actually light and fluffy homemade gnocchi! The dish was so unique and flavorful.  I cannot wait to return to this very friendly and absolutely delicious establishment!",

While I love going here for a drink after work a bite for lunch or relaxed dinner, brunch is where it's at.  100% the best brunch in Scottsdale.  Their eggs Benedict are my go to while my gf likes the croc monsier.    Neither of us like blood mary's but their blood mary bar is always well stocked (i steal the hot sauce for my eggs).  Their mimosas are perfect and they have a huge selection of whiskey and wine.  Basically, a great way to spend a Sunday brunch... or really any time.  Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "I came here on a Monday night and the place was poppin!  I sat at the bar viewing their craft brew menu on the way.  Seems like they have 2 special beers on a weekly basis, but you have to ask the server what kind.  Unfortunately, they're generally IPAs and I'm not a fan.  I shot for an Amber Ale while my friend ordered a mix drink.    For our food I went for the Chicken & Dumplings and my friend the Jerk Chicken Salad.  The Chicken & Dumplings was okay in my books.  It came with chicken, balls of dumpling, carrots, and sugar snap peas.  The peas gave it some crunch, but I wanted more texture; some shaved fried tortilla shells might have done the job plus it needed some spiced up kick.  I thought the dish overall would have made a perfect chicken pot pie stuffing.  My friends jerk chicken was spicy in my books; but she didn't care for the extra char on the chicken; plus it was dry.  Though the citrus dressing and avocado salad was an excellent combination.    In the end, the place had a cool vibe and probably a place to chill for some craft brews and appetizer bites.  The service was really on top of things, but overall the food was okay at best. - Enjoy!",

Their beer selection is impressive, featuring four local breweries and several other microbrews from across the USA. Their prices for a pint of Odell's IPA, I found to be exorbitant. $7 for a small pint. I was surprised.  After slow service and a burger that needed some improvement, the manager asked my wife how things were. She gave an honest answer, and didn't get any kind of response other than \"that's harsh\". Between lackluster service that was bordering on being ignored, high beer prices and food that was so-so the experience wasn't worth it. I won't be returning and I suggest you don't either. Reluctantly, I have rated this place 2 stars..",

She said she'd take the salad off the bill and just charge for the chicken that came with it. (We just had a couple bites and mixed it in with the salad). We told her this and she gave a very unprofessional eye-roll of doubt. Usually this is when they offer to give you something else, or a manager comes to check on you to see if they can do anything, but no, not here.  For the rest of the time we were ignored. The manager would occasionally pass by, glance at our table and shake his head and mutter something. The servers were all grouped up chatting while ignoring us.  Overall, a very frustrating experience and a terribly unprofessional staff. We were very polite to all of them and didn't deserve that terrible service.",

Nope. Normal size burgers, just over priced. Oh yea all sides are a la carte. So the $13 is just for the burger. LAME!!! But hey other than that things were good.

When the time came to get the bill, the waiter told our table (8 of us) that he couldn't split the bill. Fine. But we still had credit cards. When we started asking him to put different amounts on a total of 4 cards, he got all huffy and said \"Fine! I'll just split the checks.\" Then he brought the checks and they were all messed up and when we asked to have them corrected he again got huffy. Finally after we paid we were walking out and my husband heard our server and his manager bad mouthing us. When he confronted them, they said \"usually in a large group like that somebody just pays for everyone.\" Really?!? We are not business travelers expensing things to our company. We are regular people with budgets. It's not like we didn't want to pay or tip, that's what we were trying to do! It was a negative experience and I wouldn't go back.",

A day later their manager Kevin called me and said he had found them. I asked him to hold onto them until came by next time and he said he'd mail them to me! I live in California and was pleased to see my sunglasses arrive 2 days later.   I'll be back for the beer and the service!",

Coincidentally this was the first time I had ever been to TapHouse and it was pretty impressive. Seems like they have plenty of beers on tap, but being that it was brunch, I ordered the blood orange mimosa. The French toasted was not a let down at all and definitely satisfied my craving for dessert and breakfast. The potatoes are standard with their breakfast items but regardless, they're pretty tasty. The croque monsieur my partner ordered had plenty of ham and the cheese it was paired with was delicious. I'll definitely be back for dinner and to sample their beers.",

For a place called \"taphouse\", my husband, ever the IPA connoisseur, was unimpressed with the beer choices. I think he settled on Odells which is a good standby. The menu is ok and just ok. They have burgers and just regular old fare. I ordered shrimp tacos which were pretty good but my server failed to tell me that they came with a side so the side (baby kale) was delivered late to the table. My husband loved the burger and said that it is definitely worth visiting for that purpose alone. My wine (selected from a decent list of wines by the glass) came in a dirty glass - not just a little dirty but a how the hell did you let it out of the bar - dirty. I sent it back and assume that they poured it from said glass into another one. Service was ok. You can sit outside which is terrific in November.",

In fact, everything was so good, we came back that evening for dinner.  Many great menu options.. I opted for salads both times and they were both really good and super fresh and huge portions. We also had a couple of their beer flights as they have really great beer selections. Got to chat with the owner Bill and turns out he's originally from OC! Super friendly, down to earth guy.

Large, made to order, juicy, on a bed of bleu, garnished with cucumber shavings which take the place of boring celery sticks. On HH menu these are only  $6!  Cheese fondue: Great! Not amazing because it is on the liquid side of cheese and is more reminiscent of cheese soup...but the crusty parmesan topped bread is perfect for dunking. Did have to add copious amounts of salt despite the kick from the harissa oil.  Kids: They are welcome here! There is a comprehensive kids menu and for $8 you can select a course, side and drink.  Drinks: Comprehensive wine and beer menu with some inventive cocktails as well, but my fave was the frozen margarita, priced at $7 during HH and packing such a delicious punch that I had to beg my hubby to drive us home. Have you ever had a frozen marg at ztejas? Hands down the best and just as amazing here.  Bill came to $41 for two alcoholic beverages, three appetizers, and one kid's combo meal. Fantastic value!

Same thing with Mac and Cheese Bowl with Shrimp; sauce was good but 'soupy', not really sure it even had cheese in it :). Wings, who can go wrong with - they were good but we got sauce on side. Hailey was server and had great friendly personality.

When we got there we found the short ribs had been removed from the menu.  What!  This was the best entre.  Also, the clam chowder which used to be filled with clams, potatoes and bacon was a bland concoction.  Very little clams and lack of seasoning.  Tasted like a thick white cream sauce.  The diced vegetables were crisp meaning they were probably added as an afterthought before servicing.  The kitchen really botched this batch of chowder.  What a disappointment.",

Service was very attentive - we were seated immediately and our server came right over to ask if we wanted water while we looked at the drink menu. We ordered drinks then decided to split the beer cheese fondue - very tasty and when we ran out of bread, more was brought to us. My friend ordered the cuban sandwich, and I ordered the Taphouse burger. Hands-down, the best burger I've had in over a year. My friend said her cuban was amazing. Both sandwiches were huge and we ended up taking half of each home (I'm sure it wasn't because we stuffed ourselves on the fondue). I'll definitely be back!",

The missing piece is \"value\", not that it's expensive but it's what you get for the price.  There were no surprises as everything is described but 4 wings or 5 shrimp for an appetizer that tasted great and you want to share, so you'll need to order more and they're not inexpensive.  The flatbreads are  lavosch with toppings.  Meh.  As for the entrees, they looked and tasted great, but if you're a seafood/fish lover and want salmon, you should order the salad with salmon for $17, instead of the salmon entree for $25, as the serving on the salad is more appropriately sized for the entree and obviously if you're reading this you can figure out that we think that the entree portion was  too small.  Lots of great beers (tap house, right?).  Very nice and attentive staff  So we'll try it again and hope that they get the wrinkles out.    As I mentioned we wanted to love this place.",

The server recommended the burgers and 4 people in our party decided to try them. 3 of them came out red through out when they ordered them medium and one person said slightly pink in the middle but it was red. She was going to try and eat the burger and ate part of half of the burger but had to complain. The server brought her half of burger back and it looked disgusting they just threw her half burger backwards on the bun and brought her plate back with her scraps back to her. When you pay $14 for a burger you should have some higher expectations. The burger when cut obviously when put back on the grill looked like a dry lump of coal. The server said he would have the manager come and talk to us but obviously our party of 10 was not important enough for the manager. Will never go back there again!!

The service was fine, but I wasn't the least bit impressed with the food. I wasn't really feeling anything on the menu so I ordered the sliders, thinking they'd be safe. Wrong. First impression when they came out was, where is the top bun? Next thought was, where's the beef? The meat was smaller than your average grocery store frozen meatball. Three of them could've fit on one bun. And there was a really weird taste. They actually took them off the bill, which I appreciated but it still put a dent in my wallet. Fries were ok. Wife had short ribs and garlic mashed potatoes--she liked them--all I could taste was salt. They had a decent beer list but unfortunately we won't be going back.",

Delicious soft bun, meat cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. Gooey cheese and and other ingredients and well... I think that's what I call heaven. The coleslaw was delicious ! The Cuban? Yummy!!!!! I couldn't put it down. I personally despise pickles but the ones on the sand which added a crunch and awesome flavor I just had to eat them. Mom and I both said we will most certainly be back. I had a white sangria that was so fruity and delicious it was hard to not hAve two....but we had shopping to do. The service was really great and the chef / owner came out to say hello. Amazing place and cannot wait to go back !",

While this was happening some of us decided to go to the restroom and they were disgusting! It looked like no one had cleaned them in several days, they smelled terrible and the trash was overflowing! After coming out of the restroom we found out that manager was refusing to seat our group and that they would not be able to serve us. I have never been treated to such poor service ever! The restaurant had more than enough room for us and they would not give us any reason why they could not accommodate our group. With all the other fantastic restaurants in the area I can't imagine this place will be open very long based on the way they treat their patrons.",

Umm ok. So we asked for table of 5 plus a high chair, took them about 10 minutes to figure out they couldn't seat us for at least an hour, hostess was so rude- said they don't normally seat parties of more than 4 (what!?). Walked out front to find three empty 4-top tables, walked back in to hostess and asked if they could push two together and she told me that's not their policy and she would have to ask a manager- even more attitude from her now- I let her know I would like to speak to the manager at this point. He turns out to be even less help than her. We explained we lived up the street etc, he seems like he could care less. Just a side note here- we are a clean cut married couple- dressed casual but nice- late twenties with a beautiful little blondie baby and we literally live two seconds from here. So bummed at how lame this place turned out to be. Won't be back. Last thing- we decided to eat at ha humble pie instead, turned out to be happy hour still and we were seated right away either amazing service as usual and great food.",

They do a nice job with kids meals - good selection and price. While we were here, we got word that the burgers are among the best (this, after filling up on shrimp)...so we decided to return at a later date. Came back second time and sat outside on their patio - definitely best seats in the house. Great ambiance. Ordered burger, definitely good - also homemade chips were quite tasty. Waiter was gracious enough to bring me samples of wine when it was clear I had analysis paralysis to help me make a selection. We had several visits to our table from the owner, very nice and friendly, making sure our visit was satisfactory. Its a bit on the pricey side, but definitely enjoyed the experience and would return again to try even more of the menu items.",

Biggest gripe was with the prices, yes it is Scottsdale but the beer costs them the same as other places and $7 a pint is too much to charge for where others charge $5 or $6 for the same beer.  Food prices also high by about 25% over what I would consider a fair price but we were celebrating so what the heck The Coconut Joe braised short ribs were pretty damn good and the service was good. Wish this place had better prices so we could go back more often.",

Wide ranging beer, wine and spirits selection.  Weekend brunch that goes until 2 or 3 with a make your own bloody mary bar with premium ingredients! Really like this place...only reason I can't give five stars yet is the service has been a little slow and disinterested during my visits. Once they get that taken care of I'd happily give it five stars.",

    "text": "Great new casual restaurant - I live in the neighborhood and have been here a handful of times. Nice to find a restaurant that supports local farms/breweries.   I would be here a lot more if their happy hour ran past 6:00 pm but it's nice that they offer it on weekends. My favorite menu item so far is the Sherry Berry Salad - tip: order this with salmon! You get a good sized salmon filet (wild, organic salmon), that is almost as big as the one you can order and an entree. And it goes perfectly with the salad.   On the happy hour menu, my favorite starter (so far) is the shrimp mac-n-cheese. My least favorite is the flatbread - it's a crispy lavosch with toppings. Not bad but not what I was expecting.   Service is usually pretty good, I was there once when it was very slow but most of the servers seem to be pretty attentive. When the weather is nice, definitely recommend a table on the patio.   I can definitely see myself becoming a regular!",

Everywhere was so friendly, but this place. We arrived at 5:58. Waited a few minutes with zero acknowledgement yet, she walked by a few times. Once she made it our way, I kindly asked if it was still happy hour, which my watch indicated it was. She said \"no, it was over\". What a way to treat patrons there to spend money #not. We chose to leave and try a place that treats their customers well!! Back to Paul Martin's a second time in 3 days because their staff treated us well and their food was delicious.",

I asked where it was and the waitress said it would be just a minute. 10 minutes later they brought my food and it was not what I ordered. The waitress apologized and said she would get my food quickly. 20 min later after watching table after table being served their food. I again asked where my food was. I also asked to speak to the manager. The manager never came to speak to me, however 10 min later he brought my food set it down and said nothing. The waitress was kind and apologetic and I was not charged for my meal, however the way the whole situation was handled was ridiculous.   Restaurant 101 when you forget someone's order (especially twice)  that should be the next thing to go out before anything else. I really hope this place can get its service together. I was really disappointed as I every other time I've been there has been a good experience.",

There was more fried than fish and it cost $20 for something that should've cost around $12. Didn't have much taste, but the spices on the fries were good. All of their entrees are pricey for the type of food it is, but maybe it's to balance the high rent costs? We also tried the lump crab appetizer (enough food for an entree) and it was well received. Dad thought the lasagna was too acidic, but I liked it and the arugula topping. Service was good.",

The kids Alfredo had the flavor of an extra cheese in the sauce and it was perfect. And the chicken and dumplings couldn't have been more perfect. The chicken was a tad on the dry side but it was more than made up for by the perfect l perfectly done aldente veggies and what seemed to be home made gnocchi.  The sauce description scared me off initially with the description of a mustard sauce but it did not taste strongly of mustard and was a just right pairing for the dish.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I try a new spot each month since our husbands are not into trying new places. Since a new Taphouse is currently being built in my neighborhood we decided to try it out in Scottsdale. When we arrived we were seated and they had the front open so it was chilly inside as if you were on the patio. My friend was freezing so she got a hot tea. The server brought it out with 3 bags, the little pot of hot water and a tall clear glass with a handle. Not a mug. She chose one of the teabags and put it in the pot to steep. The next time the server walked by she scooped up the other 2 teabags. She tasted it and scrunched up her nose. She would have tried another flavor but she had no other choice. The other teabags had been removed. As we do at other places we try we get 2 items and split it. We chose the Taphouse salad and the cashew chicken salad sandwich with a side of Taphouse chips. We asked for the salad first. When it came it out the presentation was very unappealing to look at. Greens that looked more like weeds. Not a spring mix. And any item that was supposed to be in the salad was non existent except for a thin 6 inch slice of cucumber draped across the top. The citrus that was supposed to be in it was a few grapefruit bits the size of my pinky nail. Maybe 3 bits in each. We crunched our noses again. I tasted mine and decided not to eat it. It was disappointing. The cashew chicken salad sandwich was ok except I did not see or taste the crunch from the cashews. The only thing I tasted was the chicken and grapes. The khallah bread was a good idea to use as a bun but it fell apart pretty quickly. The Taphouse chips were good. Nice and crunchy- not soggy. I think the one thing that really turned us off was that they charged us $2 for each meal we split. It's not like we bought one meal and split that. I would expect to be charged. But we bought 2 full entrees. The split charge was posted on the menu but we figured it was if we had only ordered ONE meal between the two of us. We could have very easily split it ourselves and asked for another plate. Plus the place was empty. Just us and one other table on a Saturday. I hope that it was a server mistake. Last nose crunch- there were many flies in the restaurant. Very annoying to be eating and swatting at the same time.  All in all I think they are hoping people will drink and not notice how meh the food is. I'm not going to return or recommend this place even once it arrives in our neighborhood. I try to be factual and non emotional in my reviews. I will not go into the fact that the server was snarky. We wanted lunch but were given the brunch menu. Even after asking for the lunch menu she never brought it. $50 for lunch with no alcohol. I think not. Three stars is generous.",

We ordered beers and food allowing plenty of time to eat. We were halfway through our second round and getting worried about the food.  When we flagged down our server and she checked on it, she said our order had never gone in.  By then, it was too late to put in another order and we had to leave for our event with no dinner.  All we got from the server was \"I'm sorry\".  No effort to comp all or part of our drinks.  Nothing.  This was not a matter of the place being busy.  There were about a half dozen tables occupied and three servers working.  Just a matter of not paying attention to the customer.  After the event, I called the restaurant and talked to a woman who claimed to be the manager.  She apologized, said she would look into it and took my name an number saying she would get back to me.  She never did.  I realize that mistakes happen, but this could have been handled better and made right.  It wasn't, and we won't be back.",

So when I saw they weren't too busy I had already low expectations.  The hostess definitely didn't help change my perception.  After sitting down for a few minutes we were greeted by a wide smiled waitress named Marina.  We got tasted the beers before ordering them.  Great thing is the list is actually quite large, about 20 on tap and a dozen more bottled.  They also have wine and whiskey on tap too.  They have 2-4 rotating taps.  So definitely good spot to try out some new beers.  We ordered the chicken and dumplings, short rib and a side of mac and cheese.  The short rib and chicken and dumplings were tasty and the serving was a really good size.  The chicken dumplings were interesting, they had some nice vegetables in there adding some texture and color.  The mac and cheese was under seasoned and the rue of the mac and cheese was super runny.  Also tried the key lime pie and the homemade vanilla ice cream.  The key lime pie was tasty, not overly sweet and had nice lime flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was really creamy, pretty good.  Our waitress was nice enough to give me a candle on the key lime pie, and even comped one of the desserts.  One of the better places I have had in Scottsdale.  Good food, good service.",

We were reaching the hangry point and frantically rushed across the street in hopes that TapHouse could fill our tummies and make us happy...they did just that! We were greeted warmly and immediately seated at a decent table in the back. The restaurant itself is very casual and though comfortable it is nothing special on the inside. The service is mediocre, but our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. She got us our drinks and took our orders promptly and did a very good job of making sure our drinks were always full (which is greatly appreciated).   Up until now I would have not been excited about this place, but when we got our food the entire experience changed entirely. It did not take too long before or order was up and holy smokes it was amazing! We ordered fish and chips, sauteed kale, burgers, filet with potatoes, the jerk chicken salad, coleslaw, and fries. Every single thing was cooked to perfection, and the fish and chips along with the steak were some of the best I've ever tasted. I see why this place has good reviews; even though the atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, the fare here is perfection. TapHouse prides themselves on their abundance of beer on tap, but we aren't drinkers, so did not partake. Though if you are I would bet good money that they have great beer and pairings to go along with it. They also had some sinful looking desserts on the menu which sadly we did not partake in either, but they were enticing. I would say you can't go wrong with anything in this menu!   Our first time to TapHouse won't be our last. This place has incredible food that you have to try!",

Fries came out incorrectly, which they fixed, but they weren't notable otherwise. Food pricing doesn't match flavor or quality. To their credit, they have some great beers on tap, too bad it takes a while to receive them, even when the place is sparsely occupied.   Next time, I'll direct my friends to Humble Pie.",

My dining partner tried to AZ beer flight, she liked the Wheat beer best. We tried the beer cheese fondue which is served with slices of buttered and toasted rustic bread that we were to tear in pieces and dip. It was good but not great.",

I liked the decor, the wine bottle lighting was pretty awesome, and a neat bar area. Not a whole lot of options, and the entrees are pretty pricey. But I ended up getting some sides/an appetizer and sharing! I tried a little bit of the veggie pasta and it was pretty good. The mac n cheese was yummy but not my favorite. Hummus was tasty, and a big portion! Also waffle fries are awesome..the fact that they have sweet potato waffle fries definitely made me happy!  Good service too, nice and quick, helped me figure out what vegetarian stuff I could get. I'd like to come back again to try out lunch next time.",

We ordered spaghetti all a vodka and chicken and dumplings. Disappointed with both entrees. There were quite a few kalamata olives and others, capers etc. in it that, what is usually a wonderful sauce had very little resemblance to alla vodka. I ate it because I was hungry not because it was good. The chicken and dumplings were in a soupy broth. The chicken was tough and the gnocchi, which served as the dumplings, were very dense and chewy. It wasn't even visually appealing. We usually bring home leftovers but 2\\3 of this dish went uneaten and trashed.  Two stars is stretching it. We won't go back.",

Our server waited quite awhile before greeting us and to get our drink orders. We told her it was our first time visiting, figured we would get a run down of the brews and wines on tap or even a comment about the daily dinner special, nothing mentioned by her. During our time she didn't refill water till the end of our meal and only removed plates after the check was paid.   We ordered the wings as an appetizer- figured we could all share it for a couple small bites- WRONG! They gave us 5 wings for $10.   Entrees that were ordered were the:  Burger salad- just a medium cooked burger along side a romaine lettuce and avocado salad. Nothing special.   Turkey meatballs and risotto-$20. Very pricey for an extremely bland and tiny dish. Meatballs needed salt and the Parmesan risotto lacked any Parm cheese. They did come with a little tomato sauce but again, no flavor.   Signature Burger- cooked to order, we got medium. Was very tasty but had to eat with a knife and fork because there was so much sauce on it that it actually made the whole bun soggy.   Sliders- very tasty, did like the hollandaise sauce.   Was hoping for a better meal and we all left pretty disappointed, thinking we should have went somewhere else. For the money not worth it at all. Maybe they had an off night?? But we won't be back to try it again.",

Way overpriced for food that was subpar at best. The food also took forever to get to us (more than 30 minutes).  There was only a couple of tables which had customers. On top of that,  they need to improve on the service.....when we left all three waitresses were sitting at a booth texting on their phones. This place needs to step up their game or have Gordon Ramsey come in and straighten  them out!!  Wow!",

I decided to go with two appetizers to create a meal. The Lamb pops and hummus w/heirloom tomatoes, feta and grilled pita. Presentation was beautiful the lamb pops were beautiful cuts, beautifully grilled and seasoned and cooked to perfection. It was paired with a sweet mint salsa verde and some type of orange sauce. Both sauces complimented the lamb perfectly. The hummus was absolutely delicious and I loved the feta That's was sprinkled on. The pita bread was grilled and absolutely delicious. The presentation with cucumber rolls was both beautiful and delicious.  I highly recommend these 2 apps for a meal or as two apps to share with friends. I wish I was traveling alone and had someone to enjoy with! I will be back on my next trip to Phoenix area!",

She sat me in a booth, inside the dining area, that's actually where I wanted to sit.  The patio was somewhat busy but not the inside area.  When the hostess sat me, I said It was my first time there what would she recommend, she actually was nice at this part and suggested a few things.  I saw waiters walking by and waitresses on the other side of the salon looking at me, so I know everyone saw me but none of them cared to even acknowledge me or even smile, I was getting anxious cause I was really hungry, looking at the menu for about 5 min that actually felt like 30 with no one coming to my table to even offer water..  point being. I got up and left. Still hungry and thirsty.  It's beyond me how any restaurant would treat people like this.. if it's busy I can understand, a little smile and a hello really goes a long way, you can just say I'll be right with you, or somebody will be right with you, but when they act like you are not there when it's not even busy really gets on my nerves. Hey if you want to go there and be treated like you are invisible go ahead you probably will love that place!",

The Mac and cheese was delish, the fish and chips were awesome, the total on the ticket was totally doable since we luckily hit happy hour on a Sunday and our server helped us order accordingly. Servers who actually try and help the guests save money wins my heart and loyalty every time. Also, thanks for being so kind and accommodating to my young children! I will come back often and refer this place to everyone I can.",

We each got a drink to accompany our meals, Papago Orange blossom is a light fruity beer with a smooth finish and an Odell IPA with subtle hop flavor.  The chicken dumplings and the fish and chips are tasty. I recommend both dishes.   We finished off our meal with a chocolate layer cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream that was a sharing portion.

They have a pretty nice wine and beer menu so that's at least one plus. Another plus is their shrimp Mac-n-cheese. YummmmmEeeee!   Love the decor. It doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall type place. The service is fast, the staff is friendly. The chef has some pretty awesome creations that I still want to try so even though some things weren't to my liking, I'll still plan on sampling more from the menu.   Side Note: Okay okay. I know I don't normally comment on the look of the staff at eateries but this place? Whoooo Weeeeee!! The bartenders (both male and female) are so cute! And the waitstaff (only male on the nights I've been ... Yay for me) is really handsome.",

The server helped me to understand the difference between Croque Monsieur and Croque Madame naturally I chose the Madame due to this assignment specifically, since that will include a sunny side up egg right on top for just a $1.00 extra. Everything came out hot and amazing. Dominic our waiter was right on task and very accommodating to our requests and needs. Even the iced coffee they don't have but made sure to serve with a smile. Croque Madame consists of black forest ham, gruyere, and bechamel sauce and topped with a perfectly good egg on the top. A wonderful use of sauces to accentuate the eggs and sandwich it tasted like heaven on sourdough bread.  A great use of herbs and spices bring out the flavors in the meat and cheeses. This dish was all the way to gourmet a rich sauce that enveloped the Croque Madame was light and savory. The flavors of the Croque Madame were fresh and innovated with a sunny side up egg as its crowning jewel.  This restaurant does fantastic by using the best and freshest local ingredients on all their dishes it allows the eater to truly enjoy their dish. The flavors are harmonies light with a hint of sweetness from the little gem vine ripened tomatoes and caramelized shallots. The delicate bechamel sauce is like silk on the tongue.  The gruyere is a firm pace yellow cheese with a slight nutty flavor from France. This dish reminded me of almost sitting in a cafe in France. Compliments to Chef Patrick, all the employees, and Bill, way to go, Tap House Kitchen!!!",

I just want to say to the TapHouse, even though there is no one at your restaurant you don't have to slack on your desserts and your meals. I used to go to the TapHouse when It just opened and I would get the fish fry which is their best meal and got the chocolate brownie and it was fantastic and now that I come back to just get a quick amazing dessert it absolutely was terrible and might never come back to this place again.",

It was pretty delicious and filling. Also on the happy hour menu, I think it was Only about $6, but I'm not positive. They had a Bloody Mary bar but unfortunately it closes at three pm so I missed that. One of my friends ordered  the fish and chips and said it was really good but way expensive for how much they give you. It was like $28 for only like two pieces of fish. We also got the pepperoni flatbread that was on special that day. It was ok but nothing to write home about.   Service was a little slow but everyone was mostly just hanging out watching the game which might be why. Overall good atmosphere And I would definitely like to come back and sit out on the patio once it cools down.",

Also, their mac-n-cheese is delicious! Probably one of the best mac-n-cheese that I have had. You can really tell that everything is fresh. It's a great place to hang out with friends. And for all you whiskey lovers....they have whiskey on tap!  Highly recommend!",

BUT the beer selection was lacking and with only 20 taps at a place called the \"tap kitchen?\" Expecting a wide selection of IPAs I found 5 and they were all OK to bad. They didn't have a staple/ go-to, like Stone or Sculpin (they did have grapefruit sculpin, 1/2 point for that). They also had sweet potato fries- which are crap when you are trying to enjoy a wonderful juicy burger. (What do you dip those in anyway?)  As a man with a palette for IPAs and burgers this place missed the mark by giving you a great burger with no compliments. Like a massage with no lotion. AKA a dry Robert Kraft, gets the job done, you just leave feeling like it could have been so much more enjoyable.   Guys get a solid IPA staple and default to potato fries, you can still turn this ship around...",

We arrived and the manager was angry we had shown up an hour early and said \"we will see what we can do for you\". Normally that is ok, but considering the restaurant  was HALF full he gave us so much attitude for it. Not only did he ridicule us, but he went back to his waiters by the kitchen window and told them how we came an hour early for our reservation and started pointing at us and all the waiters whipped there head around and started staring at us. We felt extremely UNWELCOMED.  The food was amazing though, I ordered the rock shrimp pasta and thought the sauce was delicious!",

This was from a while ago, but I am just now writing the review. We attempted to eat at this restaurant in March of 2017.  We came walked in and went to the hostess booth to put our names in and were told that they can't serve us. Excuse me? They said the are not serving anyone right now. Okay. We asked if we can sit at the bar and have a drink and were told no. We thought this was really odd so we asked to speak to the manager who said the SAME THING. Wow. Had they told us initially that they were really busy right now and there would be a wait with an estimated wait time, like any other restaurant I've ever been to has done, we would have understood, but to flat-out be refused service really rubbed us the wrong way. We walked out and told several parties that were headed in the restaurant's direction of our experience and hoped they would turn around running like we did. The manager should be fired and this restaurant should go out of business.",

    "text": "The TapHouse Kitchen is a casual restaurant located in Hilton Village in Scottsdale. They serve Pub Style Foods and Global American Casual. Craft beers, Wine and Whiskies are on Tap. the dining is bright during the day from natural sunlight that comes from windows in the ceiling.  We got seated and it took fifteen - twenty minutes for someone to wait on us...we were about to leave. We eventually ordered and waited about thirty minutes for our platters.  I ordered the Beer Battered Walleye Plate. The fish was very hot so I try the other things first. The Cole Slaw seemed fresh made but was very plain and sort of bland....I guess that's ok...They gave me an extra generous portion of fries...maybe enough for three people. The fries seemed like hand cut and had fluffy interiors and were seasoned nice and did have a great taste but were thin cut and were almost cold when I received them. Now to the fish......The first bite was tasty but the batter wasn't crisp......Second bite the batter seemed soggy......Third bite the batter was very soggy......all the batter was soggy now. I don't know if the fries steamed the batter on the fish or if the oil just kept coming out of the fish and made the batter soggy.....  My husband tried the TapHouse Signature Burger. It came out almost medium rare like he asked for. I thought it looked good.....I asked him how it was and said very dry....I didn't believe him at first because it looked pretty good.....Then I asked if I could feel the patty.....IT WAS VERY DENCE and DRY. Either they had a cook on that SQUISHED all the juice out while it was cooking or the beef was too lean and was packed too tight. I thought the side of macaroni and cheese was good but under seasoned.  The food all sounds good that they offer but we experienced poor execution that brought things down.",

    "text": "My wife and I happened by this location by chance, and decided we would give it a shot.  So, if you like places with huge menu selection, and a wide diversity of items, you will be disappointed with Taphouse Kitchen.  The selection of draft beers will make up for it a little ;)  What they DO have on the menu, is all top notch. We started with the Jalepeno and Cheese tater Tots. These were NOT what I was expecting. You get 5 HUGE tots (about the size of giant marshmallow from the grocery store) They are very tasty, and come with three different dipping sauces.  For the main course, my wife got the Rock Shrimp Pasta, and I got the Chicken and Dumplings. Her shrimp pasta was pretty good, and the cream sauce was very flavorful. presentation was very nice. I was confused when I got my dinner.  When I think of chicken and dumplings, only one thing comes to mind. Chicken, dumplings, and veggies, in a creamy yummy sauce. Yeah, no. Not here! The chicken was tender, the dumplings were house made, and the carrots, roasted corn, and pea pods were obviously fresh and cooked up to order. What threw me was the broth. It was not your usual cream based sauce. It was, in fact, a stock-style broth, that included a \"wined-down\" version of their special house made mustard sauce( which is super yummy, and comes with the giant tots).  My son ( 20 months old) had the penne pasta w/ marinara sauce. That came with a bowl of fresh fruit( strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries)  He ate everything! ( I helped with the berries! )  For desert, we had the butter cake, which is served with a scoop of their house made pistachio ice cream. Again..delish!  Only 2 reasons I gave 4 stars. The menu is limited, which also turns out to make everything else better, and I think some of the shrimp still had a little sand in them.  Regardless, we will be back!",

    "text": "Once we found out about TapHouse, we never considered eating in our hotel bar again.   I'm serious.   Upscale but relaxed, trendy but mellow, this place is a great example of what excellent food and service should be, all bundled up in an atmosphere where you can wear your flip flops or a fancy dress - or both.   To say we loved this place is an understatement.   First of all, the food - we were at happy hour or here mid-day I think 4 days in a row? In a city where there are so many awesome restaurants, that's an attestation of excellence.  GET THE CHICKEN WINGS.  Yes, there are only 4. But they will fill you up because they are gigantic wings, that are perfectly cooked without breading (yes!) with a beautiful buffalo sauce with a hint of honey that pairs so well with the maytag blue cheese drizzle they come with.  They were so good I forgot to take pictures.  And we ordered them again.  And I again forgot to take pictures. Trust me, they speak for themselves. The fondue (Fon-don't-you-dare!) is also stellar. Be forewarned, if you are sensitive to spicy foods, the fondue bread comes with a little heat. But my goodness, the sauce, and the crispiness of the bread... aw yes.  We also were delighted by their crabcake, and their burger.  Do it. Just go here.   Beer selection: well-rounded and delicious. I had a double IPA whose name was FYITM (I'll let you figure out what that acronym stands for), and suggestions following that beer were excellent and spot on.   Service: Bartenders were fantastic. Super fun, super polite, and very knowledgeable of their product.   Absolutely, go here if you want the trifecta of 5 star food, 5 star beer/drinks and 5 star people - all with a clean, relaxed atmosphere.",

    "text": "I would have liked to add this gastropub to our regular rotation given the proximity to our home, but it's not going to make the cut. We didn't experience anything supremely negative or offensive to provoke scathing feedback on food, service or atmosphere. Yet the asking price is just astounding given the quality of all three features.  First, service was very friendly. After some confusion with the hostesses about sitting at the community table, we opted to sit at the bar. The large table commonly referred to as a \"community table\" isn't actually a table they will seat multiple parties at - an odd policy. The bar inside was full, but the hostess reassured us that the patio was air-conditioned in the summer and very pleasant. So we obligingly headed outside very open minded about their ability to cool the space on a late afternoon in July. We quickly realized it's next to impossible to cool an outdoor patio in the Arizona summer, and, accepting own naivete, we sat outside anyway. The bartender was very sweet.  While I perused the beer list, I kept squinting at the price thinking, \"Is this for a pint? $7?\" Compared to other venues who claim to have a diverse craft beer selection, these brews didn't resonate strongly with me. Settling for an API, I then chose the shrimp mac n cheese and a side of asparagus. Both were okay, but $11 for a tiny pot of mostly sauce and seriously overcooked noodles that fell apart at the touch of my fork? My husband really did not enjoy his burger which was sort of a mess, but the cheapest option amidst the entrees priced anywhere from $25-30. I started to get the feeling that we patrons are actually mini-tenants disguised as diners.   I understand that this remodel must have been expensive and the rent can't be cheap, but after paying $70 for 2 people, we did not walk away feeling even remotely satisfied. For the same price, you could have an exquisite meal at a gastropub in Old Town from a creative menu with stellar service (i.e. Citizen Public House style). For a much lower price, you could sit on an amazing patio and have decent food with a fun crowd (i.e. OHSO style). We won't risk another subprime experience at such an expense in the future.",

They claim to be gluten friendly, but there are really only a VERY few gluten free options and my first server (they had a shift change) didn't have much info on what other menu items could be modified, nor did she seem interested in finding anything out for me. Our second server was more friendly, but he did little more than settle up our bill.  The main reason for the poor review, however, is that the restaurant hours showed a closing time of 10:00 pm, yet at 9:00, the place was very empty, and the staff started doing close-up procedures all around us. It was awkward. There were no offers to refill our drinks or see if we needed anything else. At 9:30, we were told \"Sorry ladies, we're closing up now so you'll have to leave\" -- a full 30 minutes prior to closing time. I wasn't going to argue, but it was extremely rude. I had a friend in Scottsdale from out of state, and I was embarrassed that I had taken her there. HIGHLY doubt I'll ever go back.",

For the price, it feels ridiculously underwhelming and like we are being served tiny rations on a free tasting menu....not full orders of things.   Again, the food was tasty....not killer...but not bad. The kale is great, by the way. It just felt like you receive about 1/3 of what you would get anywhere else of similar quality for the price.

The chicken and dumplings were so-so, the burger dry.  Not worth the $14 & $13 respectively.  Not once did our waitress ask if my husband wanted another beer, another server did.  By this time several other diners had come in, and received their entrees much faster than we did.  Still waiting to see our server,but she was too busy hanging out at the kitchen window.  It took a long time to get our tab, and yet another server took our tab to cash out.   To sum up, poor service, mediocre food at best, and $7 for a 12 oz beer.  Save yourself the trouble, don't go here. Even the manager was ambivalent when we told him our issues.",

I had been a loyal customer for a long time, since Taphouse was the hidden gem that you loved to take new people to. My fiance and I would go all the time, and always bring friends. We are having a very large wedding nearby later this month and were going to direct our out of town guests to eat there throughout the weekend, but we will no longer be recommending this restaurant to anyone, nor will we be supporting it in any way.   My friend planned a surprise dinner for me and a party of about 15. She made reservations at Taphouse a month in advance, knowing that it was the weekend of the Phoenix Open. She called a week later to confirm (as they requested she do). Fast forward to ONE WEEK before the event, and she gets a call from the owner. He says the woman who took down her reservation was not authorized to do so, and it would be cancelled because of the Open. No apology, no offer to rebook another night, NOTHING. One week before and she has to find another restaurant to accommodate a big party on a Friday night. Luckily Hula's in old town was the perfect setting and offered great service. So much to being loyal to a restaurant and then being thrown to the curb when something better comes along. Sorry buddy, but you just lost the business of 15+ regulars, plus anyone we would have recommended there. We will not be back.",

They also take reservations, which is a plus!   We tried the wings and the giant pretzel apps and both were great! The pretzel was huge and the cheese it came with was so good! The cheese really makes or breaks a pretzel and this one was delicious and super creamy.   I also ordered a Moscow mule and it was great. They also have a good selection of beer and wine.  If you're in the area or need a good place for a larger party, this is a great option!",

Got seated in a booth right away and started with buffalo wing app. Our girls devoured it and said it was really good I had turkey burger and my husband had the short ribs with mash potatoes. He said slightly fatty though. I had the turkey burger it was good but little dry I still enjoyed it. My daughter and her friend loved their dishes- hamburger, grilled cheese sandwhich and fries. The fries were so good and happy they shared with me. Dessert was awesome, choc cake and butter cake with pistachio ice cream yum",

She looked at the menu, discussed with Art, the manager of the restaurant, and decided to have a grill chicken if she could see the ingredients for the dressing.  None of the dressings that the restaurant use fit her needs. So, Art told her he will make his custom made dressing, and have her try out before she ordered her chicken salad. Both of us tried Art's custom made dressing, and we LOVE it. We enjoyed our food tremendously, partly because the food were good, and mostly because a great service from Art. Thank you Art for going beyond your duty to please us.",

I was sitting there for awhile when I just went to the bar and asked for a drink. The bartender was quick and took my order and had the server come over.   We ordered the crispy calamari and charcuterie board and a few glasses of wine. The calamari was very good and definitely a good portion for two to eat. The charcuterie board was good too but I was in love with the calamari.   I personally loved ambiance of the restaurant, it wasn't too loud to not hear each other but not quiet enough so everyone can hear you. Service was great once we ordered food and price was good considering we ordered 4 glasses of wine and two food items  Definitely would go back, want to try their Sunday menu!",

I had the fish fry and fries; fish could have used a little longer to cook the batter more and basically i got a plate full of fries and warm nasty slaw.   Wife had the steak and salad for the price we paid; should have gotten a decent steak not a piece of meat made out of tendons.  Salads wasn't really good either.   My Mule drink was good not really strong and basic. Could really tell there was liquor in it. Really not impressed.   Atmosphere was good needed better airflow since it is Arizona. It was hot; which I get but man their was no air flow.   Service was okay not sure why it took so long and not sure why I only saw him three times. Never got water I asked for but I did get my cocktail. So I guess if you pay for something you get it. Wanted a another drink but never asked. Wife got water but never refilled. It was not busy I was maybe half packed.   Basically It's what's I would expect from a cruddy bar not this place.",

New location is suffering a bit, probably the size of restaurant and number of covers are exponentially greater - so they'll have to work out the kinks, but for a brand new restaurant they get 5 stars all day, as far as I'm concerned. I especially appreciated a chat with one of the managers -- some Viking looking dude who couldn't have been more welcoming, and VERY wise in his whiskey and beer recommendations.   They have a bunch of high ABV drafts on, which is always a welcome surprise in a regular glass. I don't think they switch to the snifter until 9 or 10%. Thanks for the man-sized beers! I hope that trend continues. I'm still upset nobody in Phoenix does a True Imperial pint. Haha.   Anyways, I'm definitely going back, and will be glad the rest of you naysayers won't be around to whine about trivial issues.",

    "text": "To be quiet honest, we came here out of desperation. My son really wanted to go to Houston's but they only take walk in reservations for table of 5 or more. Found out we would have a 3 hour wait. Not acceptable. So I look on Yelp to find another option out there. Found three highly rated restaurants right by each other. Iny meany might mo and we chose TapHouse. Got a table right away.   So you walk in and it's an indoor/outdoor bar with TVs at the bar but more of a modern looking bar restaurant. Very casual environment. The waitress was very friendly and very accommodating as we waited for the rest of our party.   We started out with the jumbo lump crab cake. It's stacked high with shoestring potatoes. It was jumbo. Lots of crab and very good. Love the shoestring potatoes with it. The softness of the crab cake with the crunchiness of the shoestring was just right with a small dab of tartar sauce. Hit the spot.   I ordered the special of the night Cioppino. It was really good. It came with about 4 nice huge jumbo shrimp and about 4-5 muscles. Very very good. Would recommend it if they have it on the menu that night. I would say it's pretty filling too.   My son ordered the short ribs and he thought they were pretty good too. Daughter had the local garden pasta with chicken. Didn't hear any complaints from here either.   We ended our night with a key lime pie which was very good. My son really liked the gram cracker crust. So good.   I was a little Leary about this place cause it was just before 6 and it was almost empty but by the time we finished, this place was packed and loud. Really good crowd. It's a restaurant bar so pretty loud and relaxing. The waitress was very good. Friendly and knew the menu and even knew the special too. They filled our water cups and even topped off my coffee too.   So we actually had a really good time and enjoyed ourselves. Great service. Very good food and loved the ambiance. Very low keyed and relaxing. No one trying to push you out the door.   I would have no problem coming back here. Enjoy we sure did.",

The staff was attentive and consistently checking to see if we needed anything else. We were seated quickly but it was also like 4pm on a Monday so I would hope so. The wings we had were SMACKABLE and I thought about just ordering another set of those for my meal. Glad I didn't because the spaghetti dish really did the job. It was different from traditional spaghetti with some greens in there and goat cheese on top. Very tasty. I'd recommend this for larger groups going out to be loud and relaxed.",

We were seated right away and even though it was busy the food came out fast. Everyone at the table really enjoyed what they ordered: tap house salad, mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, Reuben sandwich, mushroom soup, burger and the sliders. I would recommend this to a friend and I plan to go back this week for dinner before I go back to the east coast.",

The sliders are magical topped with quail eggs and hollandaise sauce and the crab cake was almost too beautiful to eat. For the main course we shared the THK salad with shrimp and lamb pops. The lamb pops were insane!  We ate them so quickly we had to order another one. The chef is an absolute genius...do not come here expecting bar food...this was an incredible surprise to have food in a casual atmosphere that was equal to a five star restaurant. The staff was friendly and provided excellent service. If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be here frequently!  This is a must for anyone wanting something fresh & new!  Our waitress Ti was the very best...which added to our experience!",

My husband and son both ordered the burger and said it was delicious along with the regular fries and sweet potato waffle fries.    I ordered the chicken and biscuits (not something I would normally order, but I knew the \"biscuits\" were gnocchi).  I think it is a genius and delicious idea - just wanted more of them!!   the broth was good and seasoned well - maybe just a tad too much broth, but see if you add more gnocchi it would be perfect!  :)       We were all too full for dessert, but I see us coming back and checking out the patio when the weather is better.",

The second time I went, last week, was bizarre. The mussels app was bland, and the brie and apple flatbread was the most pathetic thing to have ever left a professional kitchen. It looked like something a 4 year old would create for themselves on \"pizza night.\" I took one bite and left the rest on the plate. The waiter said that was the most popular flatbread... WHAT?!

We just tried their Shrimp Mac-N-Cheese, Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread, and Apple Brie Flatbread. I think I may have dreams about that amazing Mac-N-Cheese! Yum! The flatbread was different--it was more of a cracker than what you usually get with flatbread but also delish!  Both types of flatbread were very tasty! Also, I had the Moscow Mule, which was excellent and served in authentic copper mug. The hubby drank the Orange Blossom beer, which we both love.

My bf continues to order the Turkey Rueben wight he fingerling potatoes (SO BOMB) and i am obsessed with the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich. Would def recommend to anyone!",

I like the fact that they have a Saturday brunch. Also they have a daily special which so far have been great. Today I got jambalaya special, it was tasty and filling. I also got the key lime pie and it was phenomenal.",

It's the 'Cheers' place you go to for chilling-out with regs w/o pretentiousness! The entire staff is so friendly and accommodating. Food/drink is 100% consistent w/out a ginormous bill! The Manager, Matt is hands-on and always helping to make it a smooth ride for all...such a sweetheart. I worked in the industry a long time ago but never met a mgr, so kind as Matt. Btw, he enjoys to golf so, ask him about his game! Chef Patrick is an amazing chef and great guy who rocks the kitchen...he puts the 'Rock' into the Rock Shrimp 'n Mac!! He checks all food going out b4 it's served to make sure it's 100% TapPerfect! Michel, Damian and Juan bring the bar alive while Natalie, Haley and Jessica are wonderful servers (I'm leaving a few out)but tip them all well! Yes, you'll be also LOVE TapHouse but only you can decide to do it and enjoy it!! ENJOY!!",

Our server Jessie was perfect! she genuinely seemed interested in our table, helping us decide on food, and bringing out a birthday dessert. As a former server I know sometimes all your customers can look the same and you are focused on turning tables and being efficient, but her cheerful and sweet attitude was awesome! It definitely added to the experience!  The food was excellent- I got the burger with truffle potatoes as my side and both were fabulous. My husband got the halibut dinner special which he said was some of the best fish he's ever had. My only issue was it seemed a tad overpriced (fish was $32 and platter of 4 medium turkey meatballs is $20) but the food was honestly so good it won't keep me from going back, lol! I'll just be mentally prepared to spend a little more next time",

How big is the bathroom? Does it have a diaper changing station? Can the waiters \"handle\" a table that has infants and parents that are NOT ordering off the alcohol menu?   Well the Taphouse passed today!   My good friend and I stopped by for lunch and it was a nice experience. We were seated quickly, accommodations were made for high chairs, and our server was quick to attend us.   I had the Clam Chowder, as it was the SOTD and it was delicious! I also had a hot coffee that was served in a nice glass mug.   My friend ordered a burger that looked great and some sides for her little boy.   The atmosphere was nice and I am sure we will be back.   Oh, and they do have one changing table in the large stall!",

    "text": "I was excited to check out TapHouse Kitchen over the weekend for brunch with a group... We were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl chose THK because of their happening and kid-friendly atmosphere, brunch cocktail specials including a \"make-your-own-Bloody-Mary bar,\" and the great food she'd experienced there before.  Note: Brunch is served at THK on Saturdays and Sundays from 9am - 3pm.  Birthday girl made an 11am reservation for the group.  We walked in and were pleasantly surprised at first by the energy in the place.  There were a couple of people at the hostess stand that gave us a nonchalant \"hello\" (not a warm welcome), before we looked up to see that some of our group was already seated.  We headed over there and seated ourselves...  The waitress was sweet and confirmed with me that she did not need to write down our orders, despite our group size of 11 people.  \"You're sure you don't need to write it down?\" I asked.  She nodded.  I trusted her and ordered a bagel and lox for myself and a side of bacon, a side of berries, and a side of french fries for my two young toddlers to share.  I also requested an ice water for myself, which I had to ask for several times before receiving...   When the food came for our group, I started to think how impressed I was that everything came out alright.  And then I looked to my right and realized that birthday girl's grilled cheese didn't come at all.  We all sat there while our food got cold for a good 20 minutes.  (I'm not exaggerating).  The waitress said it was coming right out, but it didn't.  About 25 minutes later, she brought out an order of French Toast.  (Not what birthday girl had ordered).  My husband said to keep the French Toast at the table for everyone to share -- and we ended up paying for that too.  It was another 10 minutes before the grilled cheese arrived, and without even an \"I'm sorry for the delay\" from the manager that delivered it.   I had to leave to take one of my kids home, but I left feeling like we wasted our money at this brunch... and that was before I learned that we were double charged for the sides of fries and berries.  The bill showed two sides of each when we only ordered one.  (We did order a second side of bacon that luckily came out quickly).  There are so many dining options in the Valley that after this experience, I would consider before returning.  All of that said, if you find yourself at THK for brunch, the winning entrees were the French Toast and the Grilled Cheese.  I hope you have a better experience than we did.",

I was told \"no problem\" gave all my information and was told to call back a week after to confirm. I called to confirm and was told, \"yes we have you down\". A week before my reservation, the \"manager\" calls and tells me they're sorry, but they're cancelling my reservation for Sunday the 5th because they're closed. I correct him and say, my reservation is for the 3rd, not the 5th. He tells me, either way there's nothing they can do - they don't have any space because of the Phoenix Open and the person who took my reservation wasn't authorized to do so. I am floored - why was this person not aware that they couldn't make these reservations. Also, I called almost a month ago to make this reservation especially because of the open.  I was told - TWICE - that my reservation was confirmed and now have to find a new location a week beforehand for a large party. It's absurd to me that this manager/owner barely apologized and offered no assistance in fitting us in because of their mistake. They have no concept of customer service, which is extremely disappointing.",

This time it was, \"Idk if we can do that...I don't think we can...I'll ask...\" even after I said I'd had it that way before. After checking with whoever, the bartender came back and said yeah, it's not possible for them to make a vegetarian charcuterie board and they have NEVER done that. We were like, last time we did have it made vegetarian and he said \"No, we've definitely never done that.\" So basically we were accused of lying.   Aside from the charcuterie board nonsense the bartender was not personable at all. When we had questions, he kept giving one-word answers and then hurrying away before we could order. Taphouse as a great beer selection, good happy hour prices, and excellent hummus, but with the rude service and the refusal to accommodate, I won't be rushing back.",

My family and I sat for almost 10 minutes while we waited for our meal. The waiter finally stopped by, asked if we had ordered any drinks, but realized we didn't have menus, and left without taking any drink orders. 10 minutes later he's back with menus. Still no drink orders. 15 or so minutes later he finally takes our drink order. So needless to say, the service was poor. When we  finally did order, we were famished.   My husband had their signature burger which he described as forgettable.  My father had a grilled cheese with mushrooms, and Chicken Chili. He loved the chili describing it as \"filling and hearty\"   My mother had the fish fry and she loved it.  I had the chicken and dumplings and I was quite disappointed. It lacked depth, and flavor. My husband took a bite and said the Military MREs has more flavor.   The service was poor, the table of drunk girls got unwavering attention. So perhaps, they cater to a drinking crowd.   Best part of the evening? Watching a Scottsdale mom pull an Olive out of her martini and feed it to her infant. DRUNK BABY ALERT lol   My take away, come for the booze. Ignore the \"gourmet\" menu.",

You can be casual or business and feel at ease here.   Many local brew options, along with some specialties and surprises. Make sure to check out the tap and the brew pairings they offer. Chalkboard menus let you know they are on top of it.   Went with the cuban sandwich with fries that yes i dipped in my beer cheese fondue appetizer. Delish! High class bar food at your service. The manager checked in and chatted it up, along with our wonderful waiter.   Check this place out to see a little Scottsdale casual brew pub action.  Faves: beer cheese fondue, atmosphere.",

We were greeted politely and seated immediately. The server was prompt and beverages were brought immediately.  Chicken and dumplings and their Tap House burger were our choices. The burger was cooked perfectly to order. The bun dwarfed the rest of the ingredients. For the price, it seemed a bit on the small side. Tap House chips were just OK. The chicken was overcooked, dry and stringy. And the dumplings tasted more like globs of dough.  Service was first rate, though.  I think this might be best for people who want to enjoy some brews, maybe watch sports on their TVs and yuk it up with a group of friends all while being much less concerned about the food itself.",

So many people at the time I didn't know who was helping me. Overall it was good. I think the bar crew was confused as to who should help me. Mike the bartender was clueless .... Still working out service kinks!",

    "text": "Very good service, atmosphere very appropriate for the \"tap house\" style, and I can't wait until the weather cools off to enjoy the patio area. I did think everything was a little overpriced - $14 for a Turkey Reuben (actually, it's a Rachel) that doesn't come with any sides at all. I ordered a side of the sauteed kale, which is more arugula than kale...I'm not even sure there was ANY kale in it. Nice beer and wine selection, but also overpriced. Agree that it would be nice if Happy Hour went til 7.",

The cheese fondue is phenomenal and the burgers hit the spot. The main word that comes to mind for this establishment is \"consistent.\" It's always amazing. The manager/ owner recognizes us and constantly greets us. The patio is air conditioned and so comfortable to sit there. We can't say enough good things about this place. Brunch, lunch, dinner we have never had a bad experience and we've been going weekly for a year!",

The thing I love and won't forget is the owners brought in Dogfish IPA just because I asked, customer service doesn't get better than that. Now my favorite hang out. I had the turkey ruben for lunch and it was really good and the service was top notch. Great patio and now my favorite beer!!",
