If haven't been here yet, this is a must try.  Prices on everything are very well priced from the cold beers to the cheeseburgers! Haha    I always have great service here and have never been disappointed.  Prices are awesome too especially if you use yelp!  Hint.    If I was to say anything against this place it would be for the wait to get in sometimes.  This is a sports restaurant/burger place with tv's throughout showing sports 24/7 so this may not make for a good date place.  If your girl likes rabbit food and you get distracted by sports go elsewhere.  Also, if your a snowbird, with a big group, plan on waiting a bit for a table.  The burgers and atmosphere are worth it!",

My friend had the mac & cheese, French fries and the Hangover Oh My!! U can build your burger... the  ingredients option and was very very tasty.  Also, their sweet potato tots are yummy but sucks to pay the $2.00 fee instead of getting reg fries. I think $2.00 is a bit much.   Besides that, beer selection is great and atmosphere is chilled. Very clean place, nice big screen tvs inside and will definately come back:)  OH Hell Yeah!!!",

Ambiance:  I love that there were a zillion TVs so that no matter who sat where we could see the Bowl Game and Hockey Game without having to squint. I feel like it was pretty unusual to be so empty on a Friday night, but probably because the football game was being played in Tempe. The booth was very comfortable and noise level reasonable.  Food: We both had the Sleep Dog Red Rover draught to start and it was delicious. Seriously, one of the best beers I've drank in a long time. Lovely Irish Red. We waited to order until after the first beer and the waitress was very gracious. I ordered the Hangover Burger (I love over easy eggs on burgers, it's a thing for me) and my buddy had the Steakhouse Truffle Burger. Oh. My. God. We cut each burger in half and traded halves. I'm 36 and have never had a better burger. Just. Perfect. There really aren't words for how good they were. For dessert I had the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale. Another hit.   Service:  Very kind, patient and friendly service from our waitress. She really was great.   If you have out of town guests make sure to stop in here. They'll love Old Town and this place is great.",

It was so windy and the heat never reached us so I don't see anyone complaining about it so I'm not quite sure why they kept turning it off. Overall cool spot!",

I got a hangover burger and was duly impressed by two things: it actually was rare, and the egg was runny. Usually both burger and egg tend to come overcooked whenever I've ordered them elsewhere, so I was psyched. The bacon was also excellent. Pleasantly surprised!",

I'm a fan.\" Well I wouldn't call this place my favorite, I'm definitely a fan. This past visit wasn't my first time here, I've been to the Grayhawk location as well twice. I find it tasty every time I go, no matter which location I stroll into.   My boyfriend, friends, and I were looking for a spot to settle down for some beers, food, and Sunday Football in Old Town. Naturally almost everywhere we went was packed but even though Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers was very busy, we were seated right away. The staff was friendly and patient.   They have a beer of the month that's only $3 for a pint, so I ordered that and was not disappointed. They have a lengthy list of beers (hence the name) that every beer lover will find appetizing. We started with the parmesan truffle fries that were very yummy. I would have like an aioli to go with the fries but it was so busy I chose to hold back this time and go with the ketchup on the table.   Now I ordered the cheeseburger sliders with caramelized onions and au jus. Three little perfect and juicy sliders cooked to perfection and the au jus is such a good call on their part!! My boyfriend ordered the Open Pit burger that was gone before I got to ask him for a bite. Clearly he loved it. All other orders around the table looked awesome and there were no complaints from the six of us.   They had both games we wanted to see on TV in plain sight which was awesome. BONUS: If you check-in on Yelp for the first time, you get $5 off your bill! Don't forget to check-in!!  I'd definitely go back there to watch more sporting events with friends and eat great bar food.",

Went with buffalo potato chips and the pretzel. The pretzel was perfect, the cheese was average. I ate almost all of it so no complaints here. The chips were not good and I love wing sauce. Order two burgers; the juicy Lucy which was oddly cooked. It was burnt hard on the surface, well done on half and rare on the other. Like I said oddly cooked.

    "text": "The ambiance of this place is pretty good.  It has the typical sports bar feel and lots of TVs. I haven't been here in summer, so I have always asked to be seated on the patio where you can see all the TVs if you're interested and still hear the person you're with if conversation is more what you're after. The food was great! I am a sucker for a great burger and a great beer. Definitely one of my favorite burgers anywhere. The best selling point for me here is that that actually get it right on the cook! I cannot stand an over-cooked burger (read: well-done) and usually have a very hard time finding a place that can consistently get it right! I haven't been disappointed here yet whether I am in the mood for \"medium well\" to \"still mooing\" and anything in between. I would like to point out that the burgers are a bit pricier than your average bar burger. I have had the french dip here as well, and it was better than any of my other recent experiences in other places. I was about to swear off ordering french dip, but I might be convinced to hold on a bit longer. The beer list was great! Definitely something I think anyone can find something tasty on. I love being able to enjoy a tasty burger while enjoying a range of IPAs so I had a nice section of good beer to choose from. However, here's my complaint... chilled glasses! I realize that if you're just ordering a domestic lager from one of the Big Boys, then a chilled glass may be preferred. I mean, hey, those things haven't much flavor to begin with! But, when you have quality beers on the list, please honor my request for a NON chilled glass! Also, when ordering bottles, I request a glass with my beer. I have had to Remind my waitress several times that I have been waiting on a glass, and please oh please can you find me one that isn't chilled. Nope, I usually hold the empty glass in my hands to warm it up before I pour my beer. I love places that have a great beer selection for those of us who enjoy craft beer, but please know that there are appropriate ways to serve different things. It's not a deal breaker though, and I guess I can wait a few for things to warm up a bit before I start consuming. All in all, I do like this place and will return whenever I'm in the area, but the waitstaff can definitely use a bit of improvement in terms of friendliness, helpfulness, attitude.",

It had chips, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, etc and I loved it!! Really great burgers. You can pick what bun you want too. The pretzel bun is my favorite. Fries were excellent as well!! Overall, we all loved the food and the quick service. The place is pretty big too. Tons of TVs which is great for sports. And some outdoor seating for cool days. Loved it!",

And when I say the service can be a hit or miss, it's usually a miss. Granted... this place has a really cool atmosphere and is perfect for watching any sport you could think of, so I understand the waitstaff can be slammed at times. However, even when there are not too many people seated the service can be slow.   TIP: If you come on your lunch break at work, make sure you know what you want - order right away and ask for your check as soon as your meal comes. That is one of the only ways I have learned to assure that I make it back to work on time.",

Our server was very informative and was around when we needed her! We got a sample of 4beers in little mini mugs (sooo cute) which was $9 and helped us chose what exactly we wanted with our food.

My juicy lucy burger lacked any juiciness and I searched and searched for that cheese. It was not there and maybe after pulling the whole burger apart looking for it my plate looked too odd to ask how the food was? I don't really know but after all the great things I had heard I was expecting to have found a new place for a good burger. Definitely not the case. Maybe the beer is extra extra cold?

I will be honest, I don't usually defer from the above food choices, but I have had friends order a burger or a hot dog and they say it's pretty good... They have a ton of TV's with nearly every game on and they get bonus points for actually having the game on and not having background music playing.

I explained I was allergic to bread and it had already touched the bread why would you transfer the sandwich from regular to gluten free bun      And then he explain it was unacceptable he stated \" you want to pay for this sandwich and re order another one and pay for it. .......  I explained again as well as my friend at the table explain to him that the order was  incorrect I just wanted the correct order. So he asked for the sandwich back to remake correct order   but in fear I stated I would wait for new order since he stated he was going to re use the sandwich for the new order. I just wanted it fresh since it was sitting there for 10 min.   But he stated he would never reuse the sandwich to remake a new sandwich. But my friend and I clearly heard him state he was going to reuse the middle part of the sandwich and transfer to a gluten feee bun. He was super rude as he was walking away ..... and stated ok I'll be right back with your new order   I have never been so embarrassed as he yelled at me about paying for both burgers after it was clearly there kitchens fault of making the sandwich and the person delivering the sandwich it was not our waitress he should have seen that it was not the correct sandwich .....   After being so hurt I didn't even want the new order ( Matt ) came back to the table and we told him that we already canceled the order because of his rudeness about the situation so he said let us make this right for you so I said no thank you I'm ok at this point ... and he walked away.... but then came back and gave a honest apology and asked if he can please remake the order ... so I allowed him to correct the issue .... after his really nice apology he brings the order out in a Togo bag  ..... was that insinuating you wanting me to leave I was so hurt I really would never eat at this place ever again .... I felt like it was enjoy your sandwich just not here  and the only reason why there is one star is because I have to at least put one to post this other wise I would put NO STARS !!!",

Another 15 minutes until his meal finally arrived. A manager asked if he could bring us some drinks which was nice but didn't comp the order that was an hour in the making. They missed an opportunity to make a bad situation better. I will return to a location closer to my house",

It came exactly as ordered, toasty roll, cheese and perfectly grilled burger, medium rare.   All of the orders come with the  BEST made fries. I usually leave them if they come included however not here. Perfect fries.  You can't do better than going to a restaurant and each item brought to the table is just perfect!

They have a great open atmosphere that opens up to a nice outdoor patio, and a nice sports bar feel showing baseball, hockey, and trivia on their many tvs. Every time I walk by it is super busy so I had high hopes.  We came in right before 8pm on a Thursday which they have trivia night! Our waitress was friendly but seemed rushed which I understand because it was pretty busy, didn't have a ton of time to check out the menus but they seemed to have a pretty good variety of burgers, sandwiches, mac and cheese, and of course cold beer! I got the American burger which wasn't bad, it did not have a ton of flavor but came on a quality bun with gooey cheese, it came with homemade chips on the side which were a nice surprise! My boyfriend got the Hangover burger which had a fried egg on it, he seemed to love it and his lager! I got the Southern Bound cocktail, it was grapefruit vodka, lemonade, and soda water.  Overall I would try this place again, I really want to try the mac and cheese next time!",

They also are the only place in town that carries they type of non-alcoholic beer my husband likes, big points for this one!  My husband and I don't make it out to Scottsdale that often so we thought we would venture that way for an ASN game and come greasy food. I only have a couple of complaints, they quoted us a wait time much much loner than it actually was. Our server was great, but the timing on the food took a little while. Also, they had the ASU game on but they formatted it wrong and it cut off a lot of the screen. We mentioned this to the server a few times, but now one cared to fix it. Weird.   But we enjoyed our burgers and went home for the rest of the game.  Definitely worth stopping in.",

    "text": "After the first time I came to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, I stewed on this restaurant for awhile. I wanted to write a review but I really wasn't sure how to rate it. After visiting the restaurant once more, I've come to a conclusion. CB&C (that's what I'll call it for ease of writing) has a great selection of beers, which they should as its in the namesake. However, a great selection of beer is pretty commonplace these days. I for one am thrilled that large selections of craft beers are everywhere now, but places like CB&C may suffer. Having thirty, even forty beers doesn't set you apart anymore, at least not as much as five years ago. I think some extra praise is warranted for the extra beer selection but not as much as maybe a few years ago.    I feel that, given the ubiquity of craft beer joints, I'm left to judge CB&C by its food. The burgers are good, in fact I'd say a bit above average. The meat itself was pretty tender, well done. We all ordered different temperatures and for the most part they came out medium rare. Not the end of the world and I'm sure on a busy night its not easy to get it perfect but none of us saw much difference in meat color or temperature despite some of us wanting it bloodier than others. The fries were pretty decent, a little heavy on the seasoning in my opinion but everyone seemed to enjoy them.  Where CB&C fell flat for our group both times was the mac and cheese and appetizers. They promoted the macaroni pretty heavily one of the times we were there, the waitress assuring us that it was one of their best, most popular items. The portion sizes were decent but the cost was a bit steep for mac and cheese, and none of us found it much to write home about. It seemed as though there wasn't much inspiration in the seasoning or cheese selection. We also ordered a few appetizers to start and most of them seemed prepackaged. Maybe they weren't but they could've been sitting out for awhile for all I know, the hummus already had a crust on it.   Overall, CB&C is your average, run-of-the-mill burger and beer joint that charges above average prices. Nothing this place is doing is revolutionary but they'd still be one of my top choices in Old Town if I wanted to eat and get out to the bars in a reasonable amount of time. If you're looking for something easy before a night out, I think CB&C is fine for that. I'd stick to the burgers, fries, and beer though, definitely the best thing about this place.",

I chose to add guacamole on my burger, which cost $2 extra. There was a very tiny smear of guacamole on my burger, definitely not $2 worth.

    "text": "Tried this place tonight for the first time after hearing about it from several sources. I was intrigued by the description of hell chips on the appetizer menu. I normally love buffalo sauce and eat it with burgers, Mac n cheese, cheese crisps etc. but these chips were so drenched in it that they weren't even crunchy when they arrived at the table. After a few chips, my water was gone and couldn't find our waitress for a refill. When she returned we asked for a side of ranch to eat the chips. Burger was ok but nothing so special to go back for. I'd rather go to red robin for a better burger and fresher bun. Then I could get free fry refills too. Too many other places to pick from in the area.",

If you do a build your own burger they charge for each item (any sauce other than mayo or ketchup was $.50) including mustard which seems silly. If my husband would have built his own, it would've been at $14 burger. While good, it's not worth that much. If I was in the area I might go again, but probably would try other restaurants first.",

The cobb salad 5/5, the vegetarian in our group almost ate a piece of chicken because it looked so darn good. Rocky point 4/5.   Service was not the greatest. Staff seemed like they had an \"attitude\". Atmosphere was good. It was more sport barish.   Overall the food was all good, service meh and atmosphere good.",

She was also incredibly patient and kind with me (and all my questions) and made sure to check up on us multiple times after we got both our appetizer and our entree.

Then, I ordered the Smoky Mmmac and Cheese, which consists of asparagus, jalapeno, bacon, cheese and bread crumbs all mixed into Mac and cheese. It was out of this world!!! I've never tasted anything so good! Hours later, I'm still craving it. Just the right amount of spicy with savory heaven. Overall, no complaints! I'd eat here every day if I were local!",

My server was pushing the cold beer but I was working, so had to pass.   I ordered the Hot and Smokey Mac N Cheese plus an iced tea for $15.92. It arrived in about 10 mins.  The flavors were okay, with gooey, melted American, Cheddar and gruyere. It also had bacon, peas and a crunchy bread crumb topping. The bread was toasted a bit too much, so some of it burned, which made it bitter.   Overall I received good service, with attention from my server and the manager.   Lots of televisions around (sports on all channels), so there was plenty to see. Due to its location, there was good people watching too.   I don't think Mac N Cheese plus an iced tea is a $15 lunch, so I'll try a burger next time.",

I have food allergies and she was so good about getting back with me ( I feel horrible I wish I remembered her name I would recommend her over and over)  The burger was amazing and juicy and French fries were so filling. Atmosphere was a blast and trivia night started half way through dinner and we pitched in a bit , was so fun ! Highly recommend this location :)   Thanks !",

It was lunch time but there wasn't even a wait so I'm not sure why it took 20 minutes to get beers and 50 minutes to get our food... When the food arrived everything looked fine with the exception of the Impossible burger which was completely charred and over-cooked (which was almost humorous considering it's not even meat that needed to be cooked). It was not worth mentioning because we would have likely waited another 20 minutes for a vegan burger to be re-fried and everyone was ready to eat. Would I come back? Possibly, but not because of my suggestion.",

They also have burgers of the week specials where you get a burger and chips for $10. Most burgers cost $12-15 dollars and you can get it bunless, or gluten free bun if you would like. They do charge $4 to split a plate, or extra if you prefer to have a salad, tater tots or fries with your burger instead ( $2) Place was packed during the GSW basketball games so food took a bit longer than expected but overall service was good. Definitely THE spot for a delicious 1/2 lb burger!",

Onion rings side were pretty good, but a place with \"cheeseburgers\" in its name needs better beef, especially at $15 for a burger.",

Saw a few burgers coming out - they looked delicious! So big! Wednesdays are like BYOB (build your own burger) night for $10!! Whatever toppings you want! That is such a deal!! I think it said Monday is like build your own mac and cheese night.  The beer list was pretty good too, lots of options, and pricing seemed about average!

The waitress was attentive through the whole meal. Three out of four of us got our meals very quickly but it was pretty obvious that they forgot about last one. Took them about 10-15 minutes after all our other food came out that they brought out the last meal. However they were very sorry about the mistake and handled it very professionally. I had the Buddha Mac and Cheese and it was the best Mac and Cheese I've had in a long time! It was super creamy and flavorful! The only big negative I really had was the music. It was insanely loud inside. There were four of us seated in the booth and I could only clearly hear my husband who was right next to me. So not a great place if you want to have a nice conversation. It did seem a little less noisy on the patio. So we may try sitting outside if we go again.",

The food is a little pricey, burgers run from $9 to $18 and appetizers around $7-$9.  The burgers are very fresh and taste delicious. All burgers come with fries which are also very good. There is a very impressive  draft beer and bottle lost and prices are pretty good. The Mac and cheese deal on Mondays is pretty sweet and they have other really good specials throughout the week.   Great spot to come hang out with friends after work or to watch a game and grab a beer. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because it just didn't blow me away and I'm picky when giving 5 stars. Overall very good bar and I had a fun experience there.",

    "text": "So disappointed with our recent visit.   Although we were seated immediately, we ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our first beer.  In that time, our server showed up at our table on three different occaisions.   The first (10 minutes after being seated) to deliver two waters without saying a word.   The second (10 minutes after the first stop) to say she was sorry for taking so long and would be right back. The 3rd (10 minutes later) to apologize again and complain that she had 2- ten tops in a row that had slammed her.  Although I can appreciate her being busy this was really not my concern. We ordered and within 5 minutes we had our appetizer and within another 3-5 minutes we had our food.   Our beers showed up about the same time as our food. So yes, terrible experience from a restaurant we have been to dozens of times.  (Mostly Grayhawk).  But, wait for it, the worst part about the entire experience was the manager who, in a fleeting attempt to ask how we were doing, was both annoyed and skeptical when I told him about our experience.  Then, in the most condescending way possible looks at me and says \"30 minutes?, Really?  That is hard to believe.\"  I asked for nothing in return and only that I was bringing it to his attention only as he had asked.  He then offered to buy me a beer, that's right one beer for the five of us.  Proof of his condescension.  Too busy to manage your table, then give it up to one of the other servers that were not as challenged. Manager failed to deliver to his employee and his customer and his owner.  Will be a very long time before we are back if ever.",

She brought it to me and this margarita looked dark and brown not the typical yellow/lime and goldish color. I always drink margaritas, there was no chance this was a margarita.  It had no tequila in there, it tasted like there was whisky in it. All the other ladies at the table tasted it and thought the same thing, this was no margarita. I told the server about it, she said it was a pre-made mix.  That's fine with me if it's a pre-made skinny margarita mix, it just needs to have tequila in it.  She was apologetic, I told her it wasn't her fault and she didn't make it. Brittany took it off the bill and I got a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheeseburger off the HH menu and got The Staple Mac n Cheese, both were amazing.  I'm looking forward to going back for great food, amazing service and the fun atmosphere.",

    "text": "I would like to start off by saying I have NEVER been so disrespected in my life!!! My husband  and I have been here many times and have had decent service, but this time was so upsetting and unforgivable. The 6 of us were there last night 9/3 to watch the opening of college football and we didn't have a problem until we were seated in a side booth against the wall with no air! After that, the problems kept coming. We were served with ice water that tasted like chlorine, but I was the only one that kindly asked our server for another water because it tasted funny and she proceeded to give me a nasty look. Funny thing is, I thought the customer is always right, but I got the dirty look! Silly me. After 20 minutes of waiting for clean water, she forgot my husbands and our friends beer and never asked us if we were ready to give our order. That is until she was done flirting with the table of men behind us.   The hostess took my name and number down so we could move to a bigger table once the rest of our party arrived. Finally after 30 minutes later, I checked to see if a table opened up since we were never notified. Finally we were moved to a more comfortable table surrounded by other tables competing for the TV's. My husband KINDLY asked one of the managers (Which there were two male managers working that night. Both wearing glasses and obese) if he could turn on the Gopher game, and the managers response was very rude by saying he doesn't know if there's an open box to change the channels. After 30 minutes had gone by and still no game, we asked the same manager again and he just brushed us off. Finally they turned the channel after almost 40 minutes. WOW. After I thought the service couldn't get any worse, our friend noticed there was a HUGE piece of glass at the end of his glass and felt something funny in his throat. We immediately called our server over to show her the glass. She took it and brought the other male manager over. He apologized to our friend and offered him a $5 gift card for his next visit. REALLY??!?! a $5 gift card for swallowing glass!!!???? You've got to be kidding! We were furious! The manager came back to our table with a \"Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers\" basic business card that didn't even have his name on it! He proceeded to ask over and over again \"What do you want me to do about it?\" Seriously!! Our friend was headed to the emergency room, but the manager insisted it wasn't his problem even though he explained to us how the glass could have gotten in there. \"When the bartenders stack the glasses together, a piece of glass from the bottom came off causing it to lay on the bottom unnoticed,\" he said. That is till someone swallows it!! HOW HORRIBLE!!!! The manager bumped up the price of the gift cards and insulted us with two $10 ones that can ONLY be used for the next visit, even though none of us will be back here AGAIN! If that wasn't bad enough, my husband and I proceeded to walk out and he politely went over to the manager, who insulted us with the gift cards,  to express his feeling about our experience there and the manager blew up! He started coming at my husband in an aggressive way and kept saying, \"What do you want me to do!!\" We were disgusted with how this guy had handled everything! We have NEVER been treated so poorly as a paying customer. The manager acted like it was our fault for letting him know how bad our service was! I walked over when I saw the manager getting in my husbands face and told him how bad our service was and how horrible they handled our friend swallowing glass! At that point, he continued to get aggressive with both of us and one of the black bouncers came over and and tried to restrain the manager. You know the manager has a problem when their own bouncer is restraining him. I continued to say, we will never be back here again and I'm calling their corporate to them them know how horrible we were treated and how disgusting their managers are. Both the managers LAUGHED in my face when I said that! Then the black bouncer put it hands on me to shove me out! My husband had to tell him to take his hands off me. We were the victims here!! We will NEVER be back here again and I hope when their management reads this they will be more selective when hiring appropriate staff because they should be ashamed of themselves!!",

    "text": "Grayhawk location review.  Please keep in mind we're talking about a beer and cheeseburger place, not a fine dining restaurant.  It does rate the 4 stars for what it aims to be.  My friend had a Cobb salad and she is the \"connoisseur of Cobbs\". Husband had chicken sandwich which he pronounced very good.  I had veggie burger and it was so good I inquired from where they purchased them.  The GM (Luis) actually came out and sat with us and told us that they are made in house and also was forthcoming in telling us about the restaurant. Service is casual but IT'S A BEER AND HAMBURGER PLACE!  If you want someone to fold your napkin & replace it when you get up to go the bathroom, you're in the wrong place. It has the feel of a neighborhood gathering place and is family friendly but not overrun with unruly children. Patio on a side of Grayhawk without a lot of traffic and bar opens to the outside on one side. Food is good & prices comparable to other establishments in this category. Please, try it as I would like to see them stay here. You can look at menu on line, there's a little something for everyone.",

This review is for the greyhawk location...I'll start first with the service....well there really wasn't any at all..upon entering, there is a sign that states a hostess will seat you but there is no one there...after about 6 min. (I timed it) she wandered out from the back and seated my wife and I...the gal behind the bar came out to take our order...I had forgot to add something and looked around only to see her heading out the door with her purse!! no mention to us that she was leaving or that anyone else would be attending to us...2 other servers (if you could call them that) asked us if anyone had taken our order..I said yes but she left and we didn't know who was taking care of us...no real response...finally, our food came..I had the Jucy Lucy burger and my wife had the turkey dipper...burger was ok, but under cooked (ordered med, it was med-rare) no real big deal but NO ONE ever came back to check on us or I would have asked for it to be cooked a bit more (needless to say, half of it went in the trash) for 10 bucks, I expected more...My wife's turkey dipper was terrible..the turkey was mushey and had no texture at all and had a very peppery taste to it...the dipping gravy had the consistency of milk and of course...NO ONE around to say anything about it to..... I honestly think Dennys could have done a better job on the dipper........at one point. there were NO employees or a manager anywhere to be found in the restaurant as they were all in the back..the bartender was actually sitting in an office chair in a back room!!!! This all during the lunchtime service... I had to get up and go find someone to get my bill....Iwhen I finally found someone, I asked where the server was and his response was \"in the back rolling knapkins\" ...this place needs a wakeup call if they think that they are ever going to survive in this market full of competition....It seems like it is just a big ship sailing with no captain or anyone in charge that acts like they give a shit about the customers.......this was my second trip to this location and also my last. I will seek out somewhere else to spend my hard earned money where they understand the meaning of service....",

Her mom came in by the bar, and the waitress was talking to her mom for a while. My wife and I figured that the snookie type of waitress must not care about tourists or a tip..  Coming from the Chicago suburbs, I now realize that we have much better establishments in the Chicago suburbs, b/c this wasn't the only bad restaurant we went to.  If you're a tourist, you would think that Shotgun Betty's would be the trashiest, but that was actually the only place that treated us well.",

I always visit three times before writing a review because I feel it's a more accurate and fair to the establishment. Today they officially lost me as a customer. I walk in and sit at the bar. There is a waitress speaking to a couple that was eating at the bar and a male bartender that was also part of the conversation. I wait because, hey they can't just leave a customer they are talking to because that would be rude. Seriously it would. However, behind the male bartender engaged in conversation is a female blond bartender texting that could have easily turned around to take my order. I waited a couple minutes and the male bartender didn't even acknowledge me. Not a glance, look, or \"be right with you sir.\"  The blonde never stopped texting. I walked out and will never go back, there's too many places to eat in this town that don't ignore you and appreciate your business. Also seriously blond bartender? Texting and ignoring a customer? Inexcusable. More inexcusable is the manager that's allowing it to happen in the first place.",

The next time Hubby and I both had the bacon blue burger, not sure if that is the name, it was scrumptious. Onion rings for me fries for hi. Shared them both and man, were they good. Sat on the patio, misters worked great, fun to people watch not only the patrons but the people on the street.wait staff did a very good job. Kept my tea filled. All was good both times.

Now it was 630 on a Wednesday so I'm fine with waiting for a table, just not when there are 5 empty ones which we are eventually seated at. Our server comes promptly to take drinks, returns again and we order our meals, the build your own burger and a grayhawk club. 45 minutes later the burger comes out nicely cooked, unfortunately missing 5 out of the 8 topping asked for.  My buddies club is heavy on the butter and slathered with mayo, he couldn't stomach more than half of it. Our drinks go empty and would remain that way for the rest of the meal. As we sat there trying to wave down our server, not to mention what looked to be the manager who was wandering around chatting up the customers and clearing empty plates, we were ignored to the point that we walked up to the bar and asked for our check. This was my second time there as it is very convenient, and this experience puts the nail in the coffin for me. I wanted this place to be good as I'm a cheeseburger fiend, but it wasn't to be. I have never posted on Yelp, but I do use it quite often and felt obligated to make my first post. This place is a joke. Food is mediocre at best, service is some of the worst I've had.",

They did a nice job on the remodel, plenty of seating, and lots of TV's.  Best part about it would be the beer selection which is good.  The bad news is the service was slow and lacked any attention to detail.  We had to wait quite a bit at the bar to place an order.  Once we did that it took some time to get the burgers out.  When they came they were on different buns than ordered.  The burgers were pretty standard but over cooked.  My wife ordered a Medium rare and it was closer to well done.  We also had to track down the bartender to get utensils and napkins.  The other disappointing factor that played into the lack of experience was the choice off attire that staff was wearing. Certain people looked very sloppy in the uniform that made the appearance off putting to the point that multiple people at the bar had said something to each other.  It must say that my wife and I were definately turned off by the staff and surprised that with the nice ambience that staff looked very sloppy. We understand that the place is new and that they need to work out some kinks so we will try it again at least for the beer.  Hopefully next time the service, the staff and the burgers can catch up to the attention that was put in to the remodel.",

Walked in, and got seated in Haley's section (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong). She got our drink orders quickly and before we knew it, our drinks were on our table! (She was AWESOME!!! Give her a raise.) Then we placed an order for some golden chicken wings, and they were absolutely finger-lickin' good! Just as good as other places, just not as crispy and greasy/oily as they're baked not deep-fried. Score!!!   Then the burger arrived... and it was game over! Food coma! Deliciousness wrapped in ooey-gooey-fattening-savory-juicy-scrumptious burger. That's all I have to say... Just order it, you'll see what I'm talking about. Total yum!

Good atmosphere and plenty of TVs to watch if that your thing.",

Ordering medium rare can be tough at some places, because some places don't know how long to cook it for, but the burger was delicious and juicy in the perfect way. Alison was fantastic as our bartender and took care of us :)",

Very quick, nice and helpful. :)   Cold beers has some of the best selections of beers with great food. One of the best sports bar settings with food that is incredibly well done. I'm never disappointed. Great spot to watch a game, catch a beer, or just eat a burger/hot dog.   The buffalo chicken egg rolls are friggin delicious. If you like hot wings and blue cheese you will love these.   The Chicago dog is authentically done with bright neon green relish, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and  NO ketchup (unless you add it).   My favorite beer here is the Sonoran White Chocolate draught.",

I had burgers both time and they cooked the meat spot on. I hate when you tell a restaurant \"medium rare\" and they serve \"medium\"! NOT HERE! If you ask for one thing u get exactly that perfect temperature.  My husband had the mac & cheese he build from the u ingredients option and was very very tasty.  Also, their sweet potato tots are yummy but sucks to pay the $2.00 fee instead of getting reg fries. I think $2.00 is a bit much.   Besides that, beer selection is great and atmosphere is chilled. Very clean place, nice big screen tvs inside and will definately come back:)",

As someone who absolutely loves a good cheeseburger and has ordered them in countless establishments around the country where the burgers are acclaimed, the burgers here are as good as I've ever had. Indeed, I'm not sure I've had better--maybe a tie with Hops Burger Bar in Greensboro, NC.  Big, juicy, high quality, and lots of choices for buns and condiments and extras. Also, the fries are to die for. And more also [Is that an acceptable phrase?], great selection of beers. Finally, terrific service--very friendly, accommodating, and quick--and fun atmosphere. Totally recommend this place (unless you prefer something stuffy or quiet), especially if you're on a quest for a GREAT burger.",

He makes sure that every regular in our group is greeted and enjoying our meal and experience. We feel valued and welcomed by him every time and we have been coming every Thursday since March! The outside server we like to request is Jordan, she very attentive and has never once messed up an order and even remembers what we order. It's such a nice change  from the past staff that would barely make eye contact and wouldn't even come back after Drinks to put food in. They also have a Barback there named Cru! He is probably one of the hardest working employees of this establishment. Our group which is sometimes 14 plus always like to make sure to say hi to him. He is always on top of everything and making sure we are completely taken care of I hope to see him in management with the company. I also want to include Mark in this! Thanks for always being so nice and accommodating.    Let's talk Food & Drinks Best drink, east bound and down  Fav appetizer, the chicken tenders and fries. You need to order it with buffalo sauce to dip and blue cheese! You'll thank me later!  - The Mac & Cheese is pretty yummy! Stay away from the pretzel..... not the best thing on the menu.  Buffalo chicken tots are always a standard",

This a great spot for Sunday funday and watching sports, just be aware it gets super busy and loud!   They have a bar, plenty of tables and booths, and a lot of tvs with just about every sports channel playing. I had just previously ate so I split an appetizer with some friends, we shared the buffalo chicken dip and French onion dip. Both dips came with chips and a small amount of vegetables for dipping. The buffalo chicken dip was so good! Just the right amount of buffalo without being too spicy and had a lot of chicken in it. The French onion dip was okay, lacked in flavor and didn't have much onion in it.. probably wouldn't order again. My hubby ordered from the build your own burger bar, got a burger with all of the fixings. It looked great and he enjoyed it! I snuck a bite and definitely would order a burger if I came here again hungry. The menu is huge and has a ton of options for everyone! The build your own burger can get to be a bit pricey because they charge you for just about every topping, but most of the menu is reasonably priced.  Our service was good, food came out quickly and our drinks remained full.   Fun spot to enjoy with friends and the perfect spot to watch sports!",

    "text": "We visited on a Saturday about 1pm, and it was packed! We were seated at the edge of the patio along the street, which was good. The nearby bar was very loud and I couldn't even hear people talk at the other end of our table; I was glad we weren't seated where it was even louder.  Our server was fine, but the food service was slow--not a surprise considering the crowd. It took over an hour for our meals to finally come out. The drinks, however, came out promptly. I had a Home Run Margarita, which was tasty. The rest of the table shared Parmesan Truffle Fries and liked them well.   When the food finally came out, I was dismayed to find my Asian Chicken salad (which was $12) was so small. It was tasty, though not filling. My son had the kids meal with macaroni and cheese and fries, and was quite happy with that. My husband enjoyed his customized burger and said the jalapenos had a good kick.  I was left with mixed feelings about the experience. It wasn't terrible by any means, but with so many choices around, I don't think I'd return to this location or try another in the chain.",

Mind you Chicago has Lockdown and Kumas so I am extremely jaded when it comes to new burger joints but I try to keep my expectations reasonably low. I would also like to preface this with the fact that I work in a restaurant and am not the kind of person that complains about everything on Yelp. First the food: pretty average to good, nothing special really but not terrible and somewhat reasonably priced with good specials. The service: it was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Our server, whose name is Jordan (sorry to put you on blast but people need to know before wasting money here), a limp, lifeless slip of a thing who barely deigned to speak to us. She messed up the order, or the kitchen did, and when I brought it up she told me I was wrong and that the two missing burger toppings had just \"evaporated\" in the cooking process. Sorry girl but aioli does not disappear when heated. After realizing that I was going to send it back and be a complete jerk or just eat I ate it and said thanks and its okay. Then we are ignored by her for the rest of the meal and when she brings us the check she charged us $19.50 for what was supposed to be an $11 dollar burger. I'm tired of typing now and this is really long but its what happened and I hope if anyone decides to waste their hard-earned money on this junk they maybe consider Stax instead.",

If you are a burger place and offer different temps you should know how to cook all the temps. My dads soda got one fill because the lack of service and burgers are mediocre.. As I would like to think it was just a bad night I will try them again sometime hopefully it won't be as disappointing. If only there was a stout burgers and beer in AZ  ....",

We get to the front and there is maybe one other couple standing around.  Normally when going to bars in the Scottsdale area your greeted by a bouncer not a hostess, but I figured hey what the heck.  So as we approach the hostess the first thing she says to us is sorry there's a 2 and a half hour wait to get in.  We say 2 and a half hours ? well unfortunately we would have missed the game if we wanted to wait that long.  Supposedly her reasoning was because the bar area was too full ?  Never heard of such a thing in Scottsdale considering I've lived here for the last 5 years.  Looking in there was clearly enough room for at least another 50-75 people in the bar area.  Not only that but her tone when saying that was very rude and condescending.  I'm thinking to myself you know your not the only bar with the Blackhawks game right ? Lol  We took our business to bottled blondes where the service was top notch and people understand the concept of customer service and customer retention.  Very disappointed after hearing this was a Blackhawks bar.  Will never go here again.  I'll post a video to show you how \"full\" it was inside.",

I had to flag down the bar back and ask for a napkin and he came back with a few bar napkins, which aren't very useful when you have messy hands.

    "text": "The last time I went to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, in the end I got a tasty burger, but it the service was absolutely horrible. I went with a group of friends, and when we went to order, I was last. The person before me was celebrating his birthday, and ordered the giant burger that he had 2 minutes to finish to get it free (and I'm sure his picture on the wall). The waitress went and got the manager to come explain how it worked depending on how many patties he ordered on the burger.   While doing this, the waitress appeared to forget about me, which I can understand, but every time she came by and checked in, I was ignored. She would as how we are doing and as I would try to speak up to get her attention, or even raise my hand, she was already walking away.   Everyone else at the table had their drinks, and food. When the manager brought over the giant burger for my friend, I told him that all my friends were finishing up with their food, and I hadn't even gotten a drink.   He asked what I wanted and said he would make sure the waitress was made aware of the situation and properly trained. Before I got my burger (all my friends were done with theirs, and the one who was celebrating his birthday finished his giant birthday burger) I was given the check for a burger that wasn't even given to me yet! Then the waitress had the audacity to come back and ask for my card so I could pay for the burger! I still hadn't been served it yet!  When the manager came back, I thought he was going to apologize, and offer me something for the atrocious service I was given. Instead he told the group he was heading a scavenger hunt contest (or something) and wanted us to go.   I finally received my burger, and ate it as quick as possible (because now my friends were waiting on me to leave), without any apology from the waitress, or discount from the restaurant.    When you are the manager, receive a complaint, confirm that your staff made a mistake, do nothing to rectify the situation, and allow your patron to be insulted even further, it shows what you think of your customers.",

A nice selection of beers and a good variety of bar foods ranging from hot dogs to beef noodles. I had the coney island dog with Four Peaks Sunbru. Both were excellent choices.  As far as atmosphere, you will love this place. Several big screens all over, live bar area, outdoor patio, and full stocked bar. This place is a must-go to on game day. Enjoy.",

The menu has all sorts of burger combos and there's a good selection of appetizers or other food if youre feeling adventurous...  They also allow you to pick your own 6 pack with all the various beers they have available. Then they throw ice in the cooler on the table in order to keep the beer cold.(hence the name)  Id recommend this spot if youre going to watch a game or just to enjoy a scottsdale day/evening.",

It was amazing and could be a signature burger at anywhere in the valley. Go there, don't be shy, and give it a try!  Obviously the first part of this joints name is Cold Beers, and YES they live up to that. Their beer selection was very good. Local beers, small brewery beers, and obviously domestic and imports. I went with the lefthand milk stout and was not at all disappointed.   With all the trendy places coming and going in downtown Scottsdale, I can see this being a place that is there to stay. Go check it out because seeing is believing.",

Last week I was on a mission to watch the Vikings play, but I was in a land of the unknown being in Scottsdale on Vacation.   I found a great spot I could sit outside, while still sitting at the bar and watch multiple games at once.  Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is pretty much what it says!  Lots of beers to choose, (mind you slightly over priced ones).  I choose the PBR tall boy it was the only beer 4 bucks or under on the menu and I had 5 of them during the 3 1/2 hours I was there!    Ashley got breakfast there and she says is was kinda ok. All I know is that the scrambled eggs looked weird to me!  Now I'm egg expert but they looked gross!  The burgers that kept coming out of the kitchen looked a little more appealing!   The staff was nice and kept me hydrated during the game and didn't balk that I brought an outside coffee in to finish before switching to brews!   The atmosphere was pretty nut-so during the games and it got packed fast!  You might want to show up early on game day!   I find it a little disturbing that you can buy the staff a 6 pack of beers to share after their shift on the menu.. Now normally I would dig this idea, but the 6 pack of beers were priced way cheaper then the actual menu price!  Kinda made me feel ripped off paying 4 bucks for a tall boy!  (which is not a bad price, but the only option under 5 bucks.. Kinda makes it a bummer)",

It's so hot out here it's worth the price! I ordered the steakhouse Truffle..... Medium rare and with tater tots. On a toasted to perfection pretzel roll.   The burger was one of the richest perfectly seasoned and well thought out burgers I've had in a long time.  The thyme roasted tomato is so amazing.  I would order again and again.  I'm hooked. My boyfriend ordered the Bacon Bleu, medium rare,  with Fries but instead they gave him chips.  At first he was disappointed about the chips, until he tried one of those perfectly seasoned chips that seem to be fried in some kind of special oil.  He loved them!!!  He also thought his burger was grilled to perfection.  The pretzel roll was toasted well and stood up to that big patty with cheese. Way to go Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers!!",

Burgers are very good and large in size,  the Hangover Burger is egg, bacon and beef patty. This generally is my first choice of combination and enjoy the combination.

    "text": "I dined alone at this sports bar/brewery in Old Town Scottsdale.  I must say that I was not made to feel welcome by the hostess.  Getting the \"just one?\" sneer and the \"this is the only place I can put you\" dismissal (referring to a table that was near the door and close to a neighboring one) when I said I wanted a table and not a place at the bar was disappointing.  [Note: I usually read on my iPad when I dine alone and there's simply not enough room at the bar for me, the plates, and the device, so I prefer a table.]  I really did not appreciate that.  That said, the burger I got, CB&CB, was pretty good with caramelized onions, pickles, and a subtle aioli.  Best of all, it was grilled to a perfect medium rare - the way I like it.  I love burgers and I like them medium rare and absolutely hate it when the restaurant insists on serving it medium well; the chefs should run the kitchen, not the lawyers - but I digress.  I opted for the tater tots.  They were perfect, and a nice reminder of what my mom prepared when I was a little boy, but these were much better than the ones she used to put into the oven frozen!  They had a perfect crunch; it's nice that they're making a comeback!  The beer menu is extensive and there are lots of TVs to watch various sports events (including a disgusting UFC bout - isn't there enough violence in the world these days without that?).  Once I was seated, the service was pretty good.  The server was friendly, although it took a bit of time to get some extra aioli.  There was an odd smell in the restaurant, almost like cigarette smoke from the old days, although the hostess insisted that smoking is not allowed.    All-in-all, the food is good but the overall experience was a bit less so.  If Yelp allowed separate ratings for service and food, the service would only get one star from me because of the hostess (not the waitress).",

Tots are still decent, but Mac and cheese is now just good not great. Haven't had the wings in a while but they were still good when cooked consistently; that has been a problem on multiple visits. Service is still very good even when busy, and the beer list is long albeit a distributor-heavy one with only the most famous local brews. If you are visiting for the first time you will likely be impressed - still better than Buffalo Wild Wings and Zipps but also more expensive - drop in value is enough to think twice about visiting often. They are expanding fast and that has possibly led to them taking their eye off the ball recently.",

There were a few issues with my food but the back of the house manager took care of the issues. He was very professional and nice.   They had enough staff working so waiting was not an issue when it came to getting food.   The chips with the buffalo sauce are super spicy or hot however you want to call it.

I unfortunately didn't order a burger, I just ordered mozzarella sticks to munch on, while my friend ordered a full meal. The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent, I usually say motsy sticks can be determined by the marinara sauce, if you have good marinara you have good motzy sticks. Their sauce was pretty decent for a burger place, not bad at all! I have to say I wish I did get a burger, for my friend ordered their BBQ/Bacon burger and it was pretty delicious! Im not a fan of BBQ, but this burger wasn't overpowered with the BBQ sauce. The BBQ taste was a good flavor that added to the burger, bacon and cheese! Gave it a nice little kick! Food was good, staff was decent, stays pretty busy on the weekends and the prices are a little high, but you have to kind of expect that for they are right there in Old Town Scottsdale. Old Town seems to have little higher prices then other restaurants down the streets. Overall A-OK place!",

    "text": "Welcome to Scottsdale Road!!! Went in this establishment at 1:30pm today hoping for a great expirience, left here 20 minutes later with not so much as a peep or eye contact recognizing us. Could it be I had my Canadian flag t-shirt on? Or could it be that I'm African American could it be I'm African American and my girlfriend is white? I doubt it was either one of those myself. All I know is I sat on the north side of their patio for 20 minutes without so much as being acknowledged. Secondly there were about seven or eight dogs on their patio and I'm pretty sure that's not kosher with the health department. So alot little disappointed in a place that everyone told me to go to and was going to have a good time. The servers there (on the patio) seemed extremely snotty and uptight, manager wasn't that much better, hostess went out of her way for us. Sbe careful of a time and day you go but Saturdays at 1-30 in the afternoon obviously was not the time to go today. If I could give him 10 stars I would because your patio service was horrendous. Just because your location is awesome doesn't mean your service can be well below par. People still notice and want good service. You should educate your staff on awareness. Arbys two blocks away was much better. (Service)",

They have a great variety of burgers and plenty of beers to choose from (almost too many). My favorite burger is the steakhouse truffle which can be accompanied by a number of side dish options, I usually go with sweet potato tots. Their other food is good too but if you're going for a first time I'd start out with a burger, they're bound to have one you'll like.   You can tell Cold Beers puts an emphasis on the quality of their food, unlike other places in the area who seem to try and get by off the location and ambience. It can get a little crowded but that's to be expected, especially in the winter and spring seasons. This has become a great go-to spot when trying to grab a bite and watch a game.   Oh yeah, you also get $5 off with a yelp check in!!",

We sent someone to the restaurant to pick up our order. When i received the order one burger 2ass not properly made to order. I phoned back and spoke to Chelsea told her what happened. Asked if someone can run over the correct burger. I was placed on hold and i think i spoke to Carl. He told me he did not have the staff to do that. I asked how he planned to remedy the situation. He said i have a couple of questions. Can you remove the lettuce and tomatos. I said no thats why i need a new sandwich. Plus Carl being such a genius if i could remove it i would have never spent the time to call.   Next course of action was to refund me the price of the burger. I said ok. Where Carl lacks the knowledge is we order a lot from there. He has lost a lot of lunch order business from my company.  When you have  that sort of attitude for remedying a situation you go out of your way to make things right.  Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers lacks the professionalism for a upsacle burger place.",

Honestly, the beef burgers weren't anything special to me. Turkey burgers are the only things that really sound appetizing to me, thinking back on all my meals here, but, again, think BIG.

I'll never come back.   Maybe I'm just no fun, but the music was so loud that the three of us that went there last night had to scream across the table to each other. My throat is sore today as a result. I don't mind loud music, but when it's deafeningly loud and all you can do is sit and look at the people you came with... that's no fun. I recommend everyone in your group bring a phone so you can at least text each other.   There were lots of choices for beer which was good, and the food I thought was good too.   The service started out great. Our waitress was friendly, she brought 3 waters to us right away, and our beers came quickly after ordering. That's when the decent service stopped. We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out (and didn't see our waitress once during that time), and the table behind us, who had been seated after we ordered our food, got their food before we did. My friend asked for her burger to be medium well and it came out rare (my guess is that it was served in a hurry once someone realized our order hadn't made it out yet).We had to flag down our waitress to get silverware and napkins. Later we asked for a box and that took another 10 minutes.   I might give them another chance, but only if it's for lunch and I have a lot of time to kill.",

I went here with my husband and another couple on 8/15. We were seated quickly on the patio around 7pm. We sat there for about 15 minutes and no one came to our table... I thought \"OK, no big deal, we'll get a round of beers at the bar and then our server will be around to help us with food soon.\" Another 20 minutes goes by, no server. We asked the table next to us if they had been served, their answer: NO. Long story short, we were at this place from 7-930 and not one single server came up to our table, ever. We had to go up to the bar and order all our food and drinks. It's too bad because the burgers were good, and they did have some pretty decent beers on tap. But, come on!!! Service is key!!!",

The original person who took my order decided to pass my order off to another employee instead of putting it in themselves. This was the first mistake (hasn't anyone ever played the game telephone?)  Each order was put on a seperate check so I had to wait for them to put it all back together. Two out of the four orders I ordered were incorrect. When I brought it up, the hostess looked at me confused and I had to ask her to fix the mistakes. They then charged me an addition $2 to split a salad which I was never told prior. When I got back to the office, I realized that there were no condiments with the food, one of the mistakes was never fixed and the the plastic silverware was so cheap, why even bother giving them?  However, after waiting 10 minutes for the servers to finally ask for a manager to come help, most of the issues were rectified (putting the orders on one check and removing the $2 split charge). The food was mediocre but it's only the first month of the location being open. Hopefully they will get the hang of things and I'll come try again.",

Several people even had their food prepared incorrectly, but didn't bother sending it back for fear it would take another year to have it fixed. I actually ended up leaving before my food even came out... I had been seated for nearly 2 hours at that point, and I felt like a beggar asking for bites of other peoples' entrees. Other people in the group had their food brought out 45 min before I left... I went home, heated up my own food, and ate it before my some of my friends got their food at the restaurant.

Since we had not been to Old Town Scottsdale, we thought we would come to this location, while they do have several other convenient locations throughout the valley.  We arrived towards the end of happy hour, so the place was already hopping on a Friday evening, but still plenty of seating available.  They offer both dining room and outdoor seating and it seems like a good size place.  Our Server Bailey greeted us almost immediately upon being seated and was courteous and attentive and walked us through the BYOB process since this was our first visit.  We started with drinks (Hail Mary) and fried pickles.  For our meal, we ordered a BYOB and a Bleu Bacon with an order of Tat-Chos.  Everything was cooked properly, to our specifications and tasted great.  The place can get a little bit loud, but that is expected considering it's a bar/grille.  The decor was kind of cool with various signage.  It is on the pricier side for a meal, but I would definitely return for the quality and service.  Bailey did a good job at making us feel welcome.",

    "text": "In the heart of Old Town, the location is a great place to people watch.  The menu is large and the custom burgers are only as good as the person selecting the ingredients, but mine was fabulous. :)  Parking can be a challenge during peak season. While there are a few spots in front of the restaurant, most diners must drive in search of an open space in Old Town, but there is a parking garage a few blocks away that typically has room for 1 more. However, beware that Old Town permits predatory towing, so you MUST be careful not to park in a business parking lot even if it is empty. Tow trucks are allowed to lie in wait nearby and watch for the second someone parks in a forbidden spot then can call the police to get immediate authorization to tow your vehicle (instead of the police or the business initiating the violation). Even if you park for 5 minutes, your car will be gone before you return. The tow fee is $165.00... ask me how I know this! As a local, for this reason, I don't plan on coming back to this location or anywhere in Old Town, I'll head to another one north of Old Town.  Prompt seating and attentive staff, quality buns and beef make for a tasty burger. The outdoor patio here is substantial and is facing on Scottsdale Rd. Heaters are readily available to make even the chilly winter nights welcoming. By day the open air patio is covered so even during the heat of the summer diners can duck out of the sun for a cold beer in shade with misters.  TVs are everywhere here so for the sports enthusiast, viewing is an added perk.",

He took my wife and I drinks and told me to get out. He grabbed my arm to escort me out and I told him to not touch me. He then said he was going to call the cops because I was trespassing. WTF? What an obvious insecure arrogant ass! There were several other customers who were in disbelief on how he was treating my wife and I and we weren't even the main issue, but was trying to calmly explain it is a bar not a family restaurant he's claiming it is. Do not go there because he has serious macho issues and apparently is very insecure and needs to feel like a man by harassing the customers. I feel sorry for him because he obviously has power / man issues!",

The original waitress happened to walk by while the other one went to go get the box, and seemed perplexed as to why I was still there. I said I was waiting for my box, and she laughed about making me wait 10 minutes for no reason other than her inability to do her job, \"oh I forgot.\"   If I hadn't already paid, she would have lost the tip right there.

My steakhouse truffle had more flavor, but the garlic breath after was pretty intense. We paid extra for fries and onion rings. Onion rings were tasty, fries were ok, cold have been cooked crispier or served fresher.  During specials or HH I'm sure it's a more reasonable value, but for full price I'd pass.",

After sitting at the table roughly two minutes another patron came to the table exclaiming that I had taken her table. I directed her to speak with the hostess with regards to where I had been placed. Immediately after the woman left, the patron from the original table where I was suppose to be placed confronted me asking if her and her friend who was now at the hostess stand could sit at the table. To avoid further confrontation I opted to change seats.    After sitting at the table where I would have been originally placed, the server came out with drinks for the other patrons clearly annoyed with us. Making the whole dinning experience uncomfortable.

Sure they are doing a lot of things right, probably everything right, but there is a lot of competition these days and a few blocks south and just to the east is a great place that is making The finest Hamburgers in the country. However that doesn't take away from all of the effort and expertise exuded at CBAC.  About those burgers I have tried a few and they are great, I really like to build my own so It's just so and that works out great for me. They make that nice and easy with the customer order forms for build your own burger and on the other side build your own mac and cheese. With the burgers comes great fries, or chips, and other options to upgrade your sides for a price. Meat and non meat options are also great for the burgers so choice and selection is awesome. My only \"beef\" with the burgers is with the cheese, it isn't melted to the patty, its always stuck to the top bun, always, so I imagine it's just how they do it, instead of a cooking problem.  The prices seem to be a little high, It's Scottsdale prices for sure, from $9.00 to $14.00 for burgers and mac and cheese option are about the same. Up grade your sides and have a few beers and per person check averages are a restaurateur's wet dream.  I like to sit at the bar where service has always been efficient if not great. The ladies behind the bar are attentive and are always ready to make that sale. Maybe I don't go enough or just because they are so busy, but nobody has ever remembered me and welcomed me back. That's a little surprising since I live in Old Town area and manage a club around the corner, and often have my pre-shift meal here. I am going to just chalk that up to the volume they are doing, this place is always busy.  Big TV's, visible management, attentive service, decent Happy hour, and a pretty good meal, in a great location works for me. Looking forward to seeing what's next from this team!",

Now, I love buffalo flavored anything, but when I ate this dip my mouth and stomach went up in flames. It was SO spicy, which to me took away some of the flavor. Also, I only got the chips and not the veggies, which was a disappointment.  Maybe next time we will actually go in the restaurant.",

    "text": "Met my AOB buddy S here for lunch. I needed to pick up a gift card so I figured I might as well grab lunch while I was there and S happened to be available. Parking can be difficult in Scottsdale but there is a parking garage right behind CB&CB so it's easy. The restaurant was about half full on a Monday. Our server was Alison. She was very nice and did a good job of keeping our drinks filled and making sure our needs were met. S ordered the Pittsburger w/ Chips ($12.0O). The chips come with and he ordered his patty Medium Rare. This burger comes with American Cheese, Cole Slaw, French Fries & Grilled Tomato. S's patty was more medium than medium rare so he was a little disappointed with that. I would have to agree that for 12 bones the patty should be perfect. Other than that, S enjoyed it. I ordered the Hangover ($12.00) with Fries ($2.00). First, my medium rare was medium rare, so good job there. Second, charging 2 bucks to add fries to a 12 dollar burger is a joke. Probably why the place was only half filled at lunch time. The Hangover comes with Jack Cheese, Bacon, Caramelized Onion, Grilled Tomato and an over easy egg. Next to the patty, the egg is the next most important protein here and needs to be done right. Overlooked and it's just a hard cooked egg on a burger. Too rare and it's just a liquid mess and kinda gross. This egg was perfect. I cut through the burger and yolk oooozed over the patty. Yum. Winner winner burger dinner. I do think the $2 charge to sub fries for the chips is a joke. On a good note we did get a 10% discount with a Yelp check-in so basically the fries were covered with a little extra off. Great service. Good burgers. High prices. Clean facility. 4 Stars.",

They have a wide selection of beers, with several craft/microbrews and a few of the hard to find selections.  The menu is pretty standard for a burger place (Burgers, fries, apps, etc).  The food is good, and there is always a crowd, especially if the game is on (then it can be standing room only).  The restaurant/bar can be loud most of the time.  The bar is usually packed as well.

When I brought to her attention the apparent mistake, she got sassy and the manager was unprofessional and lame as well. Gave me some sob story about how comped drinks come out of their pockets, like it was my fault that there was a shard of glass in my mouth and drink.

    "text": "Stopped by here on a Sunday to catch the Saints game with a friend and was not disappointed. The selection of beer was admirable, the appetizers tasty, and the ambience on the porch was festive and fun! I shared my discovery that checking in with the Yelp app on my phone got me $5 off with some of my neighbors (we were sharing a table with total strangers... European style!), and they followed suit and checked in themselves. It was the easiest way I've ever bought anybody a beer.  As for the food, first I sampled my friend's tater tots, which all sorts of good stuff on them... green onions and special sauce. I was happy to note that despite the sauce, they stayed mighty crunchy, which is how they should be. Nothing more disappointing than soggy tots... and I have had my share of those. I had to sample the wings here, which were a little hard to locate on the menu since they are listed as \"grilled drummettes\". I asked for the combination of all three types, so I could try the Classic Buffalo, Golden Mustard and Sweet Citrus Teriyaki styles. I can say that they were respectable wings--meaty and crispy and flavorful. But they tended to seem a little bit on the dry side. I would've preferred they had more sauce on them. I also enjoyed the Parmesan Truffle Fries, but should've gotten a half order... this was a big heapin' bowl of fries. Again, I could've used more grated parmesan and would prefer that the fries were a thinner cut, but they were decent and scarfable nonetheless.  This place was busy on an NFL Sunday, which made it a little bit hectic, but I have nothing bad to say about the service. Our waitress was quick and attentive (albeit somewhat busy with other tables), not to mention friendly and... gorgeous. I noticed that most of the wait staff here was super attractive. It could've been that the atmosphere here was so infectiously happy that it made me more amorous than usual. This is a great location and a fabulous place to catch a game and some good eats with friends.",

The beer was barely drinkable.  I tried the Arizona burger.  If I weren't starving I would not have been able to eat it.  If you're looking for a good burger and a beer as this place's name suggest, I would go somewhere else.",

Beer flight was cold and tasty but we ordered light flight and the server told us that the bartender set up the local flight. We didn't want to be jerks and said that was fine, but she should have handled it with the bartender and brought us what we ordered. I had the BLT and could only eat half of it because it was so dry.  Also the sandwich was not balanced. One side was all bread and the other side had the lettuce and tomato. Oh well. Others had the chili Mac n cheese hot dog and the pancakes. We laughed that the syrup was in a sticky bottle right off the grocery store shelf. I would go again but would only have an appetizer and a beer. Definitely fun ambiance!",

So 1 hour and 20 minutes to receive drinks and food at lunchtime. Food was good but not to draw me back with the service being what it was.

This is delicious but rich--you may want to bring a plus one to balance things out and split a burger with.

The second time I really wanted to try the Juicy Lucy, so I ordered it again. I also ordered a side of Mac n' Cheese and the kid sliders.  They didn't ask me how I wanted my burger cooked, but it came like medium well. The cheese was a mirage and no cheese taste at all. Good meat taste but disappointing outcome with the cheese fiasco.  The mac n' Cheese was barely OK, super fatty and nothing to make me crave it ever again.  The kid sliders were a weird construction with a cold bun, cold cheese and well done patties. The cheese wasn't melted or even warm.  French fries were OK.  I would go back if I'm in the neighborhood but it's not a place that I would be craving at all.  Cheers.",

However the waitress was horrible. Although she was easy on the eyes, she had a pretty bad temper that was obvious. I suppose we weren't the easiest to work with because we made her wait a little to take our order but it was only our first time there. None the less it was still only two meals she had to bring us. Could have been an easy table and I love to tip really good but a tip is earned not a must..I just gave it to the hostess, who deserved it and then some. We both ordered the hangover with a side of fries and I thought the food was bland, definitely not worth what we had to pay. I hate to be the one giving bad reviews so for the sake of the business I will give them 4 stars...want to give them 2. Anyhow, I won't be going there ever again. Especially on game days.",

The burgers are based off toppings and the meat is really nothing special. Side dishes are trash and it really needs an upgrade. I recommend many other places if your going for a burger.",

Really liked the chips and we tried the fries as well which were great. One person at our table got the grilled cheese and that was not worth the price, it was really just basic and nothing great but the burgers were all fantastic so stick with what they are known for!

We settled on this place because of the reverse happy hour ($5 apps) and the veggie burger.  Although the table sign and tv's both mentioned the reverse happy hour and $5 apps, no go because it's summer? I would think you would have specials in the summer as it was 11:30 PM and it was still 101 F. Argh  I let the gf order first and we were told they were out of veggie patties. We asked for a pretzel ($5 for one - $5 for two for reverse happy hour) prior to this and we said we will need a minute. The waitress came back and I asked to pay and we will eat our pretzel before we go. Paid, signed and then our pretzel came. Took about 25 minutes.  The pretzel was great and the cheese dip was familiar (likely a shelf brand) but it was good. Had to ask for napkins and the music was so loud that we hard a hard time hearing each other.

Music blaring and lots of TVs everywhere with the Diamondbacks game on (which I enjoy). But it was a little hard to hear over the music and people trying to talk over it.  For starters we shared a Mac-n-cheese dish with bacon and jalapenos and....peas?! What's up with that?! My friend picked them out for me when I whined about how icky peas are lol. But it was still very tasty and I know how to order it next time.  So we get our burgers, one friend had the Open Pit and the other had Ring of Fire. I had the Steakhouse-something with truffle oil on a pretzel bun. Ah-maz-ing. There was trouble with the Ring of Fire- my friend ordered it well done and it came out more undercooked than she could tolerate. Our server, Erin, was great! She apologized and promptly returned it. When the second one came out it still was undercooked but not as bad. A manager type came out and said he would comp her burger AND her beer. Wow! That is service. It wasn't necessary, and we made no scene about it. They fixed the burger and my friend enjoyed it but the gesture showed incredible commitment to customer satisfaction. Impressive.  I cannot wait for the central Phoenix location to open!!!",

Waitress came by for a split second 15 min later to see how food was and I wanted to order another beer and she completely ignored me and the table of 6 sitting behind us, they got so mad that they left. We had waited another 20 min just to give her a chance to come back so we can get the check, nope she was Mia so I went to the front and asked the hostess to find our waitress because we wanted to leave the service was so intolerable. Finally she came back we gave her a credit card and that again took another 20 minutes to process, she eventually came back to apologize but at that point it was too late, the experience there was ruined and we wouldn't come back or recommend to anyone else",

Egg roll wrappers stuffed with buffalo chicken and fried and topped off with bleu cheese. Yum!! She also had the CBCB burger with sweet potato tots. She ate it all so I assume it was great! I had the turkey burger, at Briannas suggestion, 1000 island style. It was cheesy and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor of the turkey but once again, its just my taste. I got the fruit with it and there was a melange of various fruits. We always have great food and service here.

The condiments seem freshly sliced and the fries were good.  They actually tasted amazing, but I gather by that time the alcohol in me was kicking in and needed something carby!    The atmosphere at the time was winding down, but I gather this place can get kicking.  Located right on the strip of Oldtown Scottsdale, I'm sure this place gets many hits a night.

Last time I went, I got a vodka soda, a burger with a pretzel bun, had to add fries, and my bill was in the $30+ range. Not ridiculous but still a bit pricey for what I got, in my opinion. Service is usually so so, as well.",

It is perfectly located in Old Town Scottsdale and on weekends, it is always packed with rowdy sports fans which makes the experience way more fun! They have a huge wrap around bar and a ton of seating both inside and on their patio. Their burgers are MASSIVE and I love that they give you the option of a pretzel bun! I ordered the Steakhouse Truffle burger to split with my fiance and holy goodness, it was delicious! I am SO happy that we split because it was 1/2lb!! It is also worth noting that their ranch dressing is phenomenal! I know that we'll be back soon with friends to watch sports and unwind!",

I have been to CB&C several times over the past year.  I love their creative BURGER options.  Their burgers are great.  They have these extra-neat ordering \"forms\" in which you can \"Build Your Own Burger\".  Toppings range from cheese to eggs to grilled tomatoes.  Pro-tip: On Wednesday nights, you can \"Build Your burger\" and fries for $10.    But, of course, it is just like me to continue to come back to this place, NOT for the Cold Beers and NOT for the CheeseBurgers.  I have had a single burger here in all the times I have gone.  So, what have I been eating you wonder?  For heaven's sake, my weakness is french fries and chips and this place has THE BEST Tater Tots EVER.  On top of it, they have Buffalo Chicken Tots and Cots in which sliced chicken, blue cheese and hot sauce are drizzled/sprinkled over the Tater Tots.  Talk about Tater Tot heaven!  Simply divine.  I hosted a large group here on their patio.  The service was just OK for me.  We had a party of about 28-32 people, but one server.  That annoyed me big time.  The server was nice and cordial, she just didn't have enough hands to move things along faster for a work lunch group.  Alas, I still love this place.  Another great deal, they have a dang-on awesome Yelp Check-in offer too.     How anyone can justifiably rate a place called \"Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers\" below 3-stars is baffling to me.  My return factor is 100%.",

So then recently someone told us they were back and it's great again! So we gave it another shot and it was pretty good! Due to happy hour and the other specials we made it our Wednesday spot.  Sadly, we started running into little issues again, most of which were handled by staff or management--but not today. Our server obviously didn't want to be there. It wasn't that busy but we waited a long time for our food when the table next to us came in well after us and got their food minutes after we did. My burger was all but cold. Our server didn't come back before happy hour was over (or much at all so I had to get up and go find silverware on my own) so I only got one drink--that's not a big deal, but then she charged me full price for the drink I did get during happy hour which is the same drink I always get a happy hour discount on. When I asked about it, she just told me I was wrong.    Some wasted time and a few bucks really doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but it's enough to keep us from going back.",

We had the buffalo dip- YUM! And a couple other things but the dip is what I remember most! Haha The drinks were good and not weak, my hubby even made a comment about it, so that's saying something. I hope the location by us will be similar! :) They would have some regulars on their hands over here.

However, we came on a Wednesday night and it was the worst it has ever been. We only saw our server 3 times- take our order, bring the food, and then the bill. We had to ask for our own drink refills from other servers because ours was no where to be seen. Our food took upwards of 50 mins to arrive, 50!! And it was not great to say the least. My beloved mac and cheese dish (which I specifically came here for) was not fresh. I could tell that it had been sitting under the heat lamp for way too long because it was dry and stuck together. My friend got the buffalo chicken totchos and ended up getting food poisoning later that night...! Bad chicken. Our server never apologized for the wait nor acknowledged anything about the lack luster service.   I am very patient and understanding about how people/places get busy and behind but you at least need to be proactive about it and put your guests first. It would have gone a long way if she had something like \"Sorry it's been awhile guys, we're short staffed tonight and doing the best we can.\"   It's just overall very disappointing because I did enjoy coming here for the unique menu options but last night were the final strikes.",

In the couple of times I've visited CBC I've had the ring of fire and the rocky point and I've loved them both-- and the sweet potato tots? Amazing!   However, on the occasions I've been to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, the service is terrible! The food can take upwards of 45 minutes to get to your table, and in that time no explanation is offered as to why, even when it isn't a busy game night or weekend. The server appears to take your drink order and your food order and disappears for the remainder of your stay until it's time to bring the bill. I'm a pretty understanding person, and forgive that when it's busy; but to happen on several occasions? No thank you. While the food is fantastic, it's a shame because the service downgrades this place significantly.  **Edit** Management contacted me and rectified the situation, which I appreciate greatly. I will have to give CB&C another chance.",

I would recommend if you want to be able to have a conversation with your date, possibly sit outside or order to-go. While seated inside there was a group of women just screaming at the tv! It was obnoxious but I think this may have been the norm since no waitress addressed that group.   The food was good. I ordered he Jucy Lucy burger and my boyfriend got the Ring of Fire with the buffalo sauce on the side. I highly recommend if your ordering something spicy, get it on the side. Their menu warns: If you can't handle it, don't order it!  Both burgers were fine. We cut each one in half and shared so we could taste them both. There was too much burger bun for my liking. I wouldn't mind giving this place another chance. Most likely during lunch time- if that's quieter?",

For full disclosure, I have been here before with my wife, son and other family several times before and had an enjoyable meal, some beer, etc. Today's lunch visit was one of those that makes you decide to never come back. So many other options. We sat down (4 of us) and ordered our food. Nothing complicated. After waiting about 25 minutes we asked for a status on our food. We were told it is up next and did not see the waitress again. 5 minutes later the 2 people at the table next to us received their food. After a total of 30 minutes I asked for a manager and she did not immediately come. Our food arrived after about 45 minutes after ordering. The waitress blamed the kitchen and how busy the restaurant was (which it was not....it was busier on our previous visits. Still no manager who did eventually arrived about 10 minutes after our food. I tried the Nashville chicken and it was burned (way over fried). Also the portion was laughable (pictured below). The manager explained they do it by weight....maybe 2 ounces. I told her it's not very good. The manager acknowledged that the table next to us put their order in after us but had no explanation for the wait. The manager checked our bill and said she would come the food but could not comp the one beer we had. That's fine if that's the rule. Then waitress brings us the check which includes a beer and an iced tea. We questioned the iced tea and she said the manager said you'd pay for both. At that point, I could care less and we paid and were on our way. I definitely feel the waitress forgot to put our order in and rather than own her mistake, she lied and made up excuses. Mistakes happen. Just own them and all is good.   This is all a shame because we have enjoyed the outdoor seating, watching NFL games, etc and based on one bad experience we won't be coming back. Bad service trumps everything!!",

Three ordered  onion rings and they were hot and good.   It just seemed like they were just not having the best night.   Very slow...  have to give this location another shot on another day",

We ordered a appetizer, it came quickly, but we ended up waiting over 30 minutes to order lunch.  Our meal was good, and overall it was a good experience.

Today we waited for about 15 minutes and got a table on the patio where they had large overhead heat lamps which made it super cozy. I ordered the broccoli cheddar bacon mac n cheese with a Riesling and my bf ordered a thousand island burger with chips and a beer. Grace was our server she was hoppin it was super busy but she did great! We will definitely be back as always. Thanks cold beers!",

We went back for lunch on super bowl Sunday. The drinks were good and the service was excellent. Everyone in the group really liked their burgers, fries, and appetizers. The mac and cheese was relatively average, but all in all it was a really good, moderately priced experience. I'd definitely recommend it for someone looking for a nicer sportsbar in the area.",

    "text": "Me and my girlfriend came here after a hike looking to replenish and refuel after a tough Camelback hike. We sat at the bar and the bartender came over and greeted us asking if she can get some drinks started for us. I tell her just a minute but we'll take some waters. Another bartender then comes over and asks for both of our IDs so I give her mine but my girlfriend didn't bring hers and wasn't planning on drinking but she said you have to have an ID to sit at the bar-OK, kind of annoying but I respect the policy so we moved to a table 3 feet away, really accomplished a lot there especially on a Sunday morning with an empty bar. We both order the Monterey chicken sandwich for 14.50$, kind of pricey for a sandwich but given the location I can understand it. The thing that was annoying is it came with chips but for 2$ more you can get fries or another side. If you're paying 14.50 for a sandwich, you shouldn't have to pay another 2$ for f**king fries. No one wants chips with their meal so it seems kind of purposeful to make chips the standard so you have to pay another 2$ to have a satisfying meal. You'd think at a cheeseburger place the fries would come standard, guess not. The server was nice, forgot a drink but apologized and ran it out quickly after. The food also came out fast and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. Good chicken sandwich, we both enjoyed it. The chicken was moist and the bacon seemed fresh. I read some previous reviews on here saying the chicken was dry so I was expecting the worst, but for 16.50 for a chicken sandwich and a decent side it better be the best chicken sandwich I've ever had and it wasn't. I ordered a beer and went with the big size and was expecting a big beer stein but it was smaller than what I thought it was going to be. For 7.50$ a beer I thought it would come in a stein. Overall, decent experience, wouldn't recommend it to anyone but on a whim and not wanting to wait for the breakfast place across the street, it did the job. You can't have premium prices and not perform on them, I feel like the majority of all reviews of this place touch on this. Cold beers and cheeseburgers, a solid plan b.",

BTW when is that next door expansion coming? The pretzels are more shiny, than tasty, more air than bread. You still get two at happy Hour, but 6 years ago they used to be tops in town, but now just a bad pretzel.

This is a bar environment so we weren't expecting to be overwhelmed by the decor but it was actually cute and the outdoor patio had misters which made it comfortable. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't good. We ordered the Juicy Lucy and I had the onion burger which came out just so so as you could tell they had sat for a little while back there. They took about 30 minutes to make which we didn't complain about but to have your name include cheeseburgers, I would assume your burgers would be great. Our burgers came out underwhelming and the bun was soggy which is a big pet peeve of mine. I would have asked the server for another bun but she was too busy on her phone to notice we needed help. This place wasn't great by any means, I feel as though other local places in old town have better burgers so we would not recommend this place. Also, the manager appeared to have been there randomly walking around but not once did he come to any table that I saw to ask how the experience was. If he had, I would have told him my opinion. Don't order the sweet potato tater tots, they came out soggy and weren't worth the up charge. The fries my husband ordered were ok, but it's hard to mess up fries. The best thing about this place was the cold beer but you can get that anywhere. So avoid this one until they fix the issues.",

    "text": "Please read this in it's entirety to understand how awful the service was at this place. It was 8pm and my friend and I had to wait for a table to open, so we had to walk around in the 100+ degree weather in Old Town. The restaurant said they would text us in 30-45 minutes. We waited exactly 35 minutes until we went back to the restaurant because it was so hot outside and we needed some A/C! The people at the front were both on their phones, whispering to each other and giggling when we walked in. We asked if they were ready for us. They kept gossiping and whispering while talking to us. They said that they had a table opened 10 minutes ago for us, but we had never gotten a text (even though they were both on their phones anyway)! We got sat down, and the waiter walked away without talking to us. We waited almost 10 min for them to ask what we wanted to drink, since we knew it was going to take a while for them to come back, we ordered our food too. The service got worse from here. A table full of people drinking beer was getting surrounded by girls of the wait staff flirting with the drunk men and not waiting on people. One girl was pacing around the restaurant. I watched her walk outside, inside, into the kitchen, and to the front. She never had anything in her hands or stopped at any tables. She joined the crowd at the drunk table. Our food finally came out and no one came back to us for quite a while, but when they did they asked if we wanted our check. We ordered dessert (the s'mores which is so good!! a tiny pot with a fire in it surrounded by marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate so u can cook them urself!), but it took an odd amount of time. When I go to Cold Beers, I usually order this for dessert. All that had to be done for this dessert is assemble the crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows and light the fire. It took 20 minutes and no one had come by our table. We finally asked a random waiter that wasn't our own to check on it for us. It came out 10 minutes later. We soon realized the flame was not lit. We found another waiter and told them, since we obviously could not light it ourself. The stuff inside to keep the flame lit could be toxic or need special care for all we know. The waiter took it into the kitchen and came back with it unlit. \"Do you have a lighter?\" she asked us. We were completely shocked. That is very unprofessional. She went back and got it lit. This experience took long enough, so when it was brought out FINALLY, we asked for the check. It was not split, even though we asked for it to be, so we had to wait for another check for us to each pay for what we ordered. We found and told the manager all of this. They gave the s'mores to us for free. Which was not at all worth it. We finally paid, which took a long time (obviously) for us to get our cards back after we paid. We got out around 10pm. Not a great experience. 10 is our curfew, so we of course missed that because of how long it took.

We've been here a few times and every time it's crazy busy, so plan on waiting for a table especially during peak season. If you're going for happy hour I would suggest you call ahead and make sure they are still offering specials. For example, when we went during spring training they were not honoring happy hour specials. :(   I was back-and-forth on giving this place a 3 or 4 rating, but unfortunately the service is never been spectacular so that coupled with the happy hour situation ... dropped it down to a three.",

They do have a pretty good TV set up though if you are going for sports, so maybe just stick with the drinks, sit at the bar, and stay away from the food.

Anyway, he ended up putting a shot of well liquor in, fine, but then we found out they added that to our bill. A $7 shot of well liquor to spice up my watered down drink. Will not be returning.",

They have a patio sitting area looking out into the streets. Perfect spot for the parade. They specialize in burgers and beer. They have an option to build your own burger. Good variety of beer to chose from. Here's our comments on specific dishes:  1) Asian Chicken salad - I love peanut sauce and bits of fried wonton skin so it totally worked out for me. They didn't over kill on the dressing so I would highly recommend the salad.  2) The Staple Mac & Cheese - They used three different types of cheese and it mixed together very well. It was probably one of the best I've had. Server was right about it still being good after you reheat in the Microwave. They used thin curly noodles and topped off with some bread crumbs!! YUMMY!!! =)  3) Bacon Blue cheeseburger - Burger was good and the portion was big enough that you almost need fork and knife. I'm not a big blue cheese burger fan however my husband enjoyed it. He was only able to finish half.   Great place to hang out with friends and watch the game!  Remember to check in to get $5 off... =)",

The burgers were excellent each time & came out super hot.  You can make your own burgers or mac n' cheese here, and it comes out exactly how you want it. There's a big list of beers as well as you would expect from their name. There are TV's everywhere and they're all big. I will definitely be coming back here during football season.

Lots of people gathering to watch and root for their team made it extra fun and interesting. I always prefer more hawks fans in the room, being from Seattle, but this worked too.

We prefer to split a burger during happy hour with no drinks... MUCH cheaper that way. Get your own food and down a couple of drinks and you'll easily hit $25 a person for a burger. No thanks. I'd rather not drink away my hard earned money at a 400% markup. YMMV",

Our server, Cole, brought our food out piping hot, made certain we had everything we needed. No dearth of sports on the flat panels that were everywhere. Even the canned music, a bit loud for us, was pleasing (not head-banger). Nothing not to like really!",

    "text": "We returned the next night and enjoyed a few Happy Hour apps and a $12 Build Your Own Burger with unlimited toppings. The portion on the Hell Fire Chips is way too huge!! Really they need to serve about 1/2 to 2/3 of the amount and take a buck or $1.50 off the price. There's no way two people could eat that - or maybe offer two sizes - one size for two and one for a group of 4 or more. They were spicy and delicious with ranch dressing to cool them down.  The grilled asparagus were great - not overcooked at all with a nice charred flavor from the grill. The grilled tomatoes served with them were a nice touch.  We ordered a burger with a wheat bun (a tad dry :-( unfortunately), Swiss, bacon, jalapenos, red onions and mushrooms and the upcharge for onion rings (very good). It was delicious despite the slightly dry bun. ____________________________________  Original review:  For Chicago fans this place is great because they have WGN and we were able to see the Cubs game.  Many beers are $3 a can. They let us sit at the bar for 90 minutes and only had three beers total.  People around us looked pleased with their food.   We will be back for the next Cubs game!",

The one star is for the food which never disappoints.  The service is a whole different story.  After we were seated we waited for at least 15 minutes and my son finally ask if we could please get a server.  About 10 minutes later finally we had one.  We put in our drink order and an appetizer.  Our appetizer was served and eaten and we still did not have our drinks.  Finally a manager came and delivered drinks and apologized for the terrible service also assuring us we would have great service for the rest of our visit.  Oh no , not so much.  It took another 10 minutes or so for our server to come back take our dinner order.  Then another 10 or so to ask if we wanted more drinks.  The dinner itself took at least another 15 to 20 minutes to be delivered.  Our server was nice enough just very clear they were understaffed.  So all being said and done we were in there for almost 2 hours making us late to meet up with family at zoo lights.  When we got our bill our first round was paid for.  I can assure you we did not come there for a free round of drinks.  I will continue to go to Cold beer and Cheeseburgers just not this location ever again.  Too many other options in Scottsdale to put up with really really bad service",

My wife and I split the Steakhouse burger and the Hot & Smokey Mac and cheese.  Delicious.  Who woulda thunk asparagus and Mac and cheese worked?  Kudos to the chef who developed the menu for this!  The best finds are those discovered spur of the moment.  We'll have to come back for the beers!",

    "text": "I should've followed my instincts and avoided this restaurant.   CB&CB, as they like to call themselves, offered myself and my new in-laws a terrible experience. This review will be based entirely on the service. The food was decent, but nothing memorable. I've had better at other restaurants (shout out to Rehab!).   Three problems that will guarantee we never recommend this place:   1) Makayla, our server, did a poor job at serving. While she took our orders, brought out the drinks and napkins, she disappeared soon after. After we finished eating, we waited for about 15 minutes for her to show up. The guys at the other table also played the waiting game. Eventually one of the guys from that table went inside looking for her. She took their orders and disappeared again. Finally, my father in law went in to look for her so we that we could get our check. Fast food restaurants offer better service.   2) Everything was so SLOW. The food came out slowly, the service was slow. We weren't in any particular rush, but there was a constant feeling of having been forgotten. We sat on the patio on a Sunday night. No wait, half the tables were vacant.   3) Nickel and dimed: DO NOT SPLIT AN ENTREE. We split a burger and ended up paying 7 dollars for it. First, splitting any entree is 2 dollars. On principle, I didn't want to but I did. Fine, I agreed to that. The pretzel bun was a dollar. Also agreed. But then you order normal fries and that's an extra $2 dollars, multiplied by 2 because of the split = $4. 7 dollars extra to split a burger and fries with a pretzel buns. Shout out again to Rehab, where the same configuration doesn't cost a dime extra.   This combination of events has made me a very unhappy customer. Frankly, it's embarrassing to bring new people to a restaurant where the experience is so bad.",

One our walk, we stumbled upon this place and decided to check it out. So glad we did! Their menu is HUGE and there are soooo many options that it was hard to choose. I found it easier to just do a custom burger because the menu was intense. I highly recommend the Mac n cheese btw! Also, they have a lot of local beers and also your typical microbrews and domestics.   Parking: I always love free parking (who doesn't). Right behind the restaurant is a parking garage that goes 3 hour free parking during the week.   Service: all the servers are running their asses off and give good advice if you're ever in a bind on what to order. Be sure to read their shirts too...the merchandise is awesome!",

We were 5 minutes away from the restaurant. When we arrived, the 2 ladies looked at us and maybe kind of freaked out we had 2 kids with us. Our daughters are 8 and 16. We were there for a pre bday dinner celebration. It was a day before my husbands 40th bday and he LOVES cheeseburger and beers.   Anyways, we waited for about 25/30 mins before we were seated. There was no place to wait inside or outside. So we stood outside next to the Lyft waiting area. Now I know this is old town Scottsdale on a Friday night....i get it...theres drunk asses everywhere. But if I knew the wait would have been THAT long I would not have gone with my girls.   Ok, for service and food. Our waiter was super nice!!! She was definitely more professional then the greeters. We enjoyed her and how knowledgeable she was about the menu and how attentive she was.  She noticed that we were celebrating a bday and wished my husband a happy bday and gave him a complimentary drink. =) THANK YOU!!   The food was also GREAT! Husband had his beer and create your own cheeseburger and loved it. I was brave and tried the peanut butter and jelly cheeseburger. It's was also good!   Overall, it was an ok experience. I think next time I will try other locations tho.",

To top it off, once we did get our order in, it took another 30 minutes to get our drinks. The restaurant is practically empty and yet the service is as if the restaurant is a full house, disappointing. My recommendation, skip this place not worth the wait and not worth the food. I hope management reads this and makes some changes because this is ridiculous.",

Now at $15.00 thats a rough price for such a bad sandwich.  If they start making it like a traditional Philly , thin and lots of veges on it $15 is ok.  There are better Philly's for $9-10.

Bartenders are all friendly and don't leave you waiting too long before filling up an empty beer glass. What I have noticed though is that nobody runs bar food. If you order something from the bar, make sure you check the time and ask for it every five minutes. Otherwise, the bartenders forget to check on your food.   This last time, we waited nearly 30 minutes for food. Didn't think a whole lot of it since the place was a little busy. But our entrees were clearly sitting under the heat lamp for a while. Bottom buns on our burgers were super soggy, while the tops were dried to a crisp. Maybe you get quicker food service by sitting at a table. As for the bar though, I'll just stick to beer, not food.",

Sat at the bar this time, took a little while to get menus and talk to anybody, but that was not too much of a concern at first. We ordered two classic American burgers with a veggie patty instead, no crazy substitutions, shouldn't be hard to remember... After 20 minutes food came out, what do you know... Got turkey burgers instead! Sent those back, bartender admitted it was her fault (of course it was her fault- we're both vegetarians). Took another 20 minutes to remake the burgers. The bartender dipped out and didn't even offer to compensate for the long wait or say that she was passing us on to someone else. Would love to have tipped 20% but you need to take more care of your customers.",

Hostess was prompt with us, then our waitress was a sweetheart and was the perfect amount of catering, the manager swung by to see if everything was alright and it certainly was! The burgers are perfectly done here, whether building your own or trying one of the menu preparations, you can't go wrong. The fries are also great here - thick, crispy yet fluffy goodness. Happy hour prices are awesome as well. I will be coming back multiple multiple times not only so I can fill out my punchcard on their app, but because there is an experience here you simply cannot replicate! I'm not one to hand out 5 stars willy nilly, but this establishment earned all five. Highly recommend!",

I did order the Grilled Asparagus which I wanted to try from my last visit. What a disappointment! I received 6 very thin and shriveled spears. SIX! The flavor was good but definitely not worth the 7 or 8 bucks I spent on it. I was expecting big thick plump spears and more than 6. That is highway robbery and only reflects greed upon investors/management. I don't mind spending 12 dollars for a burger because they are flavorful, juicy, and worth the money. But the Grilled Aspargus experience has really turned me off and put negative thoughts in my mind about the people behind Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers. Once again, it took forever for us to receive our check. Pretty sure we won't return.",

We were looking specifically for burgers and beer so the name definitely caught our eye. We came during march madness and the place was packed but had great energy! We sat at the bar and had a couple of beers in doors but near the open patio on a gorgeous day. They have an excellent beer selection! We also did the build your own burger and build your own macaroni and cheese!  Although after all of the additions to our meals it was pretty pricey it was totally worth the cost!  The burger we built was- Angus beef Pretzel bun Bacon Red onion  Mayo Golden mustard (which was kind of sweet) Jalapenos   The macaroni we built was perfect! I definitely recommend this combination. We added- Gruyere  Garlic Red pepper  Grilled chicken   We used the 5$ off your tab yelp coupon which was around 10% of our bill after 4 beers, a burger w fries and macaroni. What an awesome deal! We drive all the way from chandler to try this place and will definitely make it back soon!",

I have now tried a few of the burgers, a couple different mac and cheeses (including the chili mac), and the parmesan truffle fries. Everything has been really great. I think my favorites are the chili mac and the steakhouse burger so far.  The service, however, has been hit or miss. Nothing horrible, but never as good as my first visit. We have had a couple less than attentive servers and there was one visit where the music from the kitchen was loud enough to be annoying, but mostly because it was clashing with the music they were playing in the dinning area. Like I said, not horrible, but not great.  With that said, the food and beer are great, but the inconsistent service won't let me justify changing my review to a 5. I would give the food a 4.5 and the service a 3.5 if it were possible to break it down like that.",

It was busy, but not busy enough to warrant us being forgotten about for 25 minutes after being seated. Now, you'd think that after a server forgot about a table, they'd do their best to be on top of service: not the case. We saw our waitress one more time to ask how our food was, but she was gone before we could answer. We had to grab another waitress to get our check because after an hour and a half of being here, we wanted to go home. We had finished our food long ago. A different waitress happy got our check and apologized for the bad service. That's why this place got any stars for my vote.   If only the food was good. Nope. Boyfriend's cheeseburger was chewy and unseasoned. Mine would have been okay if it had been seasoned at all and the patty hadn't been burned. Boyfriend said his was burned as well.   It was too loud to hear yourself, let alone your attending party. Disadvantage.   Honestly, this made me sad. I'm hopeful that it was the high bustle of the night that made our experience so terrible. I'm hesitant to give it another try. Sad.",

This past Saturday they chose to show the ASU vs U of A game, which I can understand but then the rest of the TVs were on Ohio State. My friend had specifically asked earlier in the day if they were going to show the Auburn game and she was told yes. However, when the group at our table asked them to turn the game on just one tv the management refused. He was extremely rude and confrontational with my friend.  He should be fired for how he treats frequent patrons.  And I urge all other Auburn fans to boycott this bar.",

When we checked with the manager at 10am (in person) he said \"yes we will have the Auburn game on 1 or 2 TV's\" when we arrived with our table around 1 pm the Auburn game was not on any TV. When we asked several employees (who did nothing) then finally the manager who then said \"sorry I can't do anything for you\" I was furious. We would have gone to a different place knowing the game wasn't going to be on. My table of 12 Auburn fans then pulled up the game on our cell phones and had to watch it this way. We would have left if we had not ordered food and drinks. Just rude and disrespectful by the manager! Don't make empty promises! Won't be back!!",

It's one of those bars/restaurants that appeals to both guys and gals in that it's casual but still a bit trendy and interesting not to mention the selection of burgers and beers to choose from (not that you couldn't have guessed that from the name).   They have a great selection of local brews (which I love). Pretty much any major AZ brewery is represented- Sonoran, 4 Peaks, Phoenix Brewing, Papago, San Tan the list goes on and on. This place is usually packed on the weekends and during major sporting events so plan ahead if you have your heart-set on coming then.   Overall, this is a good place to take distant relatives that your mom made you hang out with because \"He's new to AZ and is going to ASU and needs a friend...blah blah blah\" because it's loud enough that if there's awkward silence it won't matter. Plus, there's a burger for every palate so it's a safe bet.",

First off go on Wednesdays or you are missing out as you can build your own and pile on as much naughty crap as you want all for $10. This means you can build a burger with bacon, chili, fried egg, mac & cheese, and a bunch more to make well just about impossible to finish. Just remember folks burgers are super foods they cover all the major food groups all in one delicious package! A burger a day keeps the gym away!",

After our orders were taken, we waited for what seemed like 30 minutes for our food to arrive- for two people. In that time frame, another table of four people was served and given their food. With about 10 minutes left until I had to be back at work, I asked the server to make our food to go because we didn't have enough time to eat. She came back with our food bagged up and was nice enough to foot the bill.

Cheeseburgers and cold beer, which I haven't had a bad burger or warm glass of beer there yet, so they are definitely living up to their name. However, if you feel like getting wild, the Buffalo Chicken Dip is freaking delicious.  Aside from the awesome food, the service has always been awesome for us. Between the locations at Greyhawk and Old Town, we have never had a bad service experience. Special kudos go to the Old Town location though, because every bartender interaction we have ever had there has always been positive.. particularly with Scott and Jaclyn (Jacqueline? not sure if I spelled her name correctly) but regardless, they are both badass.

I mean really, the deal should be your choice of potato for no extra charge.

Even more importantly, if the burger is split and the server can see it's fully cooked and not the slightest bit pink why serve it?

Order a beer which the first one came quick ordered some food. I ordered the buffalo sliders and and my friend ordered a burger. His burger was dry and terrible and I never got my food.

There was a table in front of us that was clearly frustrated with our waitress, so it already started off horrible. Our server Nicole was terrible, she was very rude, possessive and uncaring. After explaining this to the manager Aaron, he shrugged off the bad behavior and did not try to correct the problem. Then the food came out and one of the burgers had the cheese paper cooked into the bun, making the burger inedible. Aaron was rude once again, and did not show a shred of sympathy in the service my party and I expected. We will never return to this restaurant, and we suggest a word of caution to anyone considering this less than credible place.",

Management ( Charles ) could not do enough for his customers! He was so great and cares deeply about every single person that walks thru his doors. What a fine professional.  I was served by two of the hardest working ladies behind the bar. What struck me was how they made me feel at home immediately. They took time to talk and their smiles are only outdone by their sweet hearts. I would publicly like to than Kim and Nina for making a sad day great for me.

Cant go wrong there.  We had to drink each of us a sour (Mine was the Cucumber Crush by 10barrels from Bend) and it was the best beer I have had. So good! I love a good sour. Ok, I am getting off track. We dithered between BTOM (Build Your Own Mac and Cheese) or BYOB (Build Yor Own Burger) and opted for another burger though we had had some the day before. Hey, I like burgers. :) Ours that we built had peanut butter, bleu cheese, bacon, on a pretzel bun with jalapenos. It was tasty! And cooked well done just like we need.

I tried my husbands burger and it was as he said...too good.  And so were the fries.  We have been trying to eat better by stopping when we are full, but this burger made it hard to do so I helped him by eating the rest.  Hey, he's my husband, I threw myself on the burger for him.  The one problem I had was my beer was not cold.  It was 109 that day and I expected a very cold beer.  Maybe it was because it WAS 109 out.  It was also very loud but there was every football game being played on one tv or another so it was loud FUN and not music.  I can live with it.  It was that kind of place.  I will go back when I'm out that way.  Oh...and the CB AND CB salad is yummy too.",

Burgers are well prepared and delicious.  I recommend the blue cheese and bacon burger, with a cold beer of course.",

The burgers were ok at best and waaaayyyyy over priced for what they were.  The BBQ sauce is not good.  It has some weird vinegary taste and is super watery.  I had t o spend $2 extra for a pathetic side salad that was likely straight out of a bag.  I had to basically build my custom burger because they didn't have a guacamole bacon burger on the menu.  The equivalent burger at Rehab Burger Therapy is $12 and included sweet potato tots with all the (good) sauces you can dream of.  This crappy burger was smaller and ended up being $16.50 and tasted no different than those pre packaged costco patties.  I've learned my lesson and won't be cheating on Rehab anymore.",

Finally got someone to bring me a drink after about 30 mins.  Lots of empty tables for the 90 mins we were there but they were all \"reserved\".  No one actually ever sat in those seats, when we left the place was pretty empty.  Accidentally ran my card for $250 and my actual $20 bill.  Could not get anyone on the phone today for help.  Been calling all day.  Regardless, when a place is run this poorly on the front end, no way its being run well behind the scenes.  Food selection was plain, no signature dish to come here for.  My burger and pretzels were average for bar food.  You wanna watch a game or have a nice evening out, plenty of better places in old-town.",

    "text": "Welcome to Old Town! What took you so long!? I've been anxiously watching the \"coming soon\" sign and waiting for Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers to open. Finally they did and last night we got to give it a try! This location has the sport's bar perfected. The \"concept\" is simple: Extensive beer list, cool drink concoctions, juicy burgers, accompanying snacks and TVs and seating everywhere you look. Throw in a spacious patio and you've got a perfect storm (in a good way).   We stopped by around 8:30 pm on Friday night and saw that it was pretty packed so we thought we'd have to wait. However, thanks to the amount of seating they have, we didn't have to wait even a second! They seated us right away and my husband was in heaven thanks to the sports playing on the TVs everywhere we looked.   The menu has plenty to choose from. Of course the burger is the way to go here, but they also had chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. The burger menu is long and if that's not enough, they also have a BYOB (build your own burger) option. Not feeling a burger? Give the BYOM (build your own mac n cheese) a try! First, we ordered the buffalo chicken dip. Wow. Absolutely delicious. I want to recreate this at home. It had the perfect kick to it. It came with chips, celery and carrots to dip. For the main course, I went for one of the \"favorites\" and got the Bacon Bleu Burger with french fries. Another wow! This burger is juicy goodness at its best. The burger is topped with bleu cheese, bacon, special mayo and caramelized onions. It is incredibly hearty and I could barely finish half. It would be easy to share. The french fries had a nice salty-peppery flavor to them. The food here is hearty and perfect if you're looking for a good All American meal. I've been wanting one of these restaurants to open in Old Town for awhile!  Before I stop, I need to talk about the drinks. They have some creative drink choices, include beer flights and a \"beer and a shot\" choice. For $9 you get a beer and accompanying shot pre-selected by the restaurant to compliment each other. It was a fun little activity before the meal! There are several beers on top and they also had a detailed cocktail list.   I'll be seeing you again soon!",

Went to the one up north but that was closed but to check out the one in old town (website didn't mention construction and that the old town was coming soon). We ordered two burgers medium rare. A food runner came out and set our orders on the table with no word and a grumpy face.  Our burgers were well done. We would have complained if our server ever actually came around to see how we were doing. We were too hungry so we ate the burgers regardless. I would say they were average nothing too exciting.  As we were almost finished the server finally came around to bring us a condiment tray saying \"sorry you never got one guess its too late huh.\"   For two beers and two burgers and no refills on our waters at almost $38 I'd say its definitely not worth it. The only good part was the beer and the fact they came out quickly.  If you're going to be a burger joint and have a graphic representation of burger temps on your menu your cooks better know how to cook a burger.",

I had never seen buffalo chicken dip on a menu before, but I make it at home all the time and I had to see how it would compare.  The dip was super dry.  It was like someone took some chicken and the cheapest hot sauce they could find and put it into a food processor.  Not good.  They did have good chips though.   The beer flights were predetermined, but I would love to see a \"build your own\".  I also thought the service was super slow and my friends DIY bloody mary was served in a tiny glass with so much vodka there was no room for all the toppings (it was something like 10 bucks too).  Overall not worth the money.  There are just too many interesting food spots there to waste your time on mediocre food even with the extensive beer selection.",

    "text": "I have a tendency to find something and stick with it.  I don't like change, and I especially don't like trying new things.  This was recommended to me a four months ago, so I had a business lunch here, reluctantly.    The first thing I noticed was the large amount of big screens, then, the music playing was Iration and the place was spotlessly clean.  Being a stickler for cleanliness and consistency in food, I was hopeful this would not be a disappointing venture.    Erin (the bartender) was incredibly helpful in deciding what to try, and introduced me to my new favorite beer (Maui Coconut Porter).  Poor service can ruin the best of meals, hence I can't say enough about her professional and positive demeanor.  She exudes the highest of service, and makes everyone feel comfortable.  Her attentive nature and impeccable timing make dining here a very pleasant experience even when the rail is full, you will never find yourself waiting, and she somehow is able to stock the bar in between her customers, service bar, and even running food.   It's now three months later and I had almost tried each burger save for the O-Lineman, and then they updated the menu.  Needless to say, I was coerced into trying the new PB&J Bacon Burger, and it was a heavenly, sticky mess of goodness.  I highly recommend the food, and have never met a lunch I didn't love.  (Besides, they are incredibly insistent that you're happy with your food)  I look for any excuse to eat here when I'm traveling South.  I can say it is my new, go-to lunch eatery.",

    "text": "During the football season, you can find me at Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers most Saturdays... Why??? Because they're an Auburn bar. Am I an Auburn fan? Hell no. -BUT- it means that they are one of the few places in town that carries the SEC network, which means I can almost certainly watch my Tennessee Vols! (And drown my consequent sorrows in delicious craft beer..)  As for the actual restaurant...  I really enjoy CB&C Scottsdale for the casual, open-air ambiance and their great food. You've got to start out with the Tot-chos, which are going to be amazing. They're basically tater-tot nachos and they're twice as delicious as that idea sounds. (The half order is pretty big, but if you're going with a group of more than 4, get a full order!)  What's next? Well, you could honor the namesake and go with one of their classic burgers (which are fantastic!) or you could go out on a limb and build your own Mac N Cheese. (My preferred meal of choice!) You can add a huge array of veggies, meats and other toppings that make your mac out of this world! If you feel a little healthier, their hummus and veggie platter is great, and while I haven't tried them, their salads look pretty tasty.  So, check it out, splurge, and lessen your guilt with a stroll around Old Town afterwards. For the best ambiance, try to catch a game while you're there!",

Ordered a coke and a water while waiting for our friend to join us and 20+ minutes later still no water or coke or a return to see what the 3rd person wanted.  Seems our server was too busy with another table to help anyone else as she kept returning to same table while never even making eye contact with our table or even stopping by with our drinks.  Walked out and told hostess that the wait was too long.  I've been a server...it certainly doesn't take much more than making sure ALL your tables are being served.  Really wish the service would improve, not sure I'd go back at this point.",

They've got a full menu of very different and very delicious burgers. They have simple ones, HUGE ones and also nice, \"healthy\" burgers too.   Of course, they have many beers (very good beer) available, local domestic and imported.   It is called cold beers and cheeseburgers after all. And you can't go wrong with either.   -- But my most recent experience was a little lackluster on the service department. Our waitress was no where to be found when I needed some ranch dressing for my mozzarella sticks and also when I wanted to pay the bill.  She was enthusiastic while talking with us, however those times were few and far between.   Great place though, I'll be back.",

We did a drive by and saw all the TV's figured we would give it a try. We got there a little after noon. They were busy, but we were seated immediately at a table were we could view 3 games at the same time.   CB&CB has many beers on tap. I wish I could quote the number, but I don't remember. Our burgers were very good, fresh and done to order. We had Fries and tots as sides. We wife joined us after work and had a salad that she enjoyed.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. When we finished eating we told the server that wanted to stay and watch a few games. We told here that we could move to the bar, but she said we could stay as long as we wanted.   I would highly recommend CB&CB when you want to kick back with some friends for food and a drink and to watch sports on TV. We were there in the afternoon and it seemed very family friendly. I am not sure what it is like in the evening however.",

This is an ideal place to watch sports of pretty much any kind (with the exception of MLS soccer, which they didn't have).  TVs are massive and plentiful, as are the delicious beers.  I don't think there was a single bad seat to watch a game in the large dining area.  They've also got a patio area with plentiful seating, if you're lucky enough to catch a day that's cooler than melting. The beer list is enormous and you're sure to find something you enjoy on it.  Even the restrooms were impressive given with how clean, spacious and well decorated they were.  I saw a few of the eponymous cheeseburgers pass my table and I could tell, from the looks on people's faces as they took the first bites, that they were delicious.  Great place to hang out with friends, especially with a large group.",

I have never had service as horrible as we did last night. By the end we were all wondering if it was some kind of joke. I will keep it short because I could probably write a book about everything that went wrong. First our waitress knowingly brought us the wrong drinks and did not even offer to fix it. We all did the build your own burger so she asked us to write our names on our orders so there was no confusion about who ordered what but this proved pointless. After waiting 45mins one burger came out with no name or any knowledge of what was even on the burger. The waitress took it back to the kitchen to find out whose it was 20mins later a different burger came out with no name so that one was taken back to the kitchen also. Finally 40mins after the first burger was taken back, all 4 came out. Not one burger was right or what we ordered and when one said they ordered a pretzel bun the waitress said she would bring the bun so we can reassemble the burger at the table ourselves. We were clearly aggravated with her response and so she proceeded to roll her eyes at us every time she walked by our table and would refuse to check on us after the food was brought out. I finally had to go find a manager and although he was extremely nice and did comp most of our bill it was by far the worse restaurant experience I have ever had. Such a shame too because we go there often.",

Like a speed demon I selected a bun (pretzel!), a protein (angus beef) and a cheese (gruyere). My pencil hovered over veges. (Yes to jalapenos and caramelized onions. No one to kiss that night. Boo! Hiss!)   I heard someone at my table order avocados on the side. \"Ooo! Good idea. Check.\" While in that section I thought, \"Hmmm...what about an egg? You've never had an egg on your burger. WHY NOT?\"   [Shrug] People. I hadn't been to the gym in three months. What's little bit of caloric love?  At Step Six I tossed in lettuce, tomato and mayo. I circled back and opted for some regular onions. (Again, no prince that night. I like a bit of crunch to my burger.) I topped off my rare burger with a tangy chipotle sauce and a side of sweet potato tots. (Interestingly enough you can top your burger with Steakhouse Herb Butter. How curious!)  God bless our server that night. I have to poll my friends to see if anyone can remember who helped us. She was the Shizzle. Patient, on top of our beer orders like a ninja and sweet as pie. We must have asked one thousand questions.  FIRE FIRE FIRE While eagerly awaiting my mountain of food Jeff ordered \"The Hell Fire Chips\". I scoffed when I heard they were hot. Potato chips, buffalo sauce and blue cheese.    My tongue thanks beer for its many healing powers. Speaking of beer, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was serving a Black Butte Porter at the time. I really hope they still have it on tap!  Back to the flame. Ursula had ordered something called TOT CHOS. Think of nachos, layered with chili, sour cream, guac and roasted pepper cheese sauce. Got that? Except the base is on tater tots! Also FIRE. A half order can easily be shared.  When The Burger finally rolled out my eyes opened like saucers. Cutting it with a knife clearly wasn't going to help! It wasn't pretty eating, but, oh boy was it yummy!  There were left overs. Good place. Fun!  Oh! Oh! Oh! I just heard. The restaurant is still offering the same Yelp check-in offer. $5 off your order! GET IT!",

What I particularly liked was the effort they put into making it fun and inviting. I'm not one for trivia but they were having a trivia night and people were really getting into it.   My friend and I came in late so we just did the trivia amongst ourselves.   Either way a good place to stop in for a bite. I'd be interested in seeing what a regular night is like do I'll be back.",

I thought, this seems promising because there are almost no open seats on a Tuesday afternoon.   Upon sitting down, we had prompt service and our waitress was nice. We tried the buddha's delight mac and cheese, which was really bland and boring. I ordered the steakhouse truffle burger, which was in one word, GREASY! Each bite I took seemed to get greasier. I really couldn't taste anything else. My friend had the bacon and bleu. He thought it was pretty good, but was surprised that he could barely taste the bleu cheese, since it tends to be a strong flavor.    I would give it another try because I have friends who recommended it, but if it tastes just as bland next time, I won't be back again.",

    "text": "Yelp Review Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers Old Town Scottsdale 4222 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251  Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was definitely a suitable restaurant for a Tuesday night. They have a special menu from which you can build your own burger, exactly the way you want it, which I thought was pretty neat. I didn't actually build my own burger though, because their list of burgers on the menu was huge, and each description I read just made me salivate. I choose the 'Open Pit' burger, and was extremely pleased when the food was served. The burger was so big I had to rotate it a few times to decide how to take the first bite. It was topped with onion rings, bacon, and BBQ sauce, just the way I like it. Everything was cooked just right. Although, I would have appreciated a few more onion rings in the burger, the few I received were fairly small. After the main course, my brother ordered the S'mores dessert, which was pretty neat how they served us a small pot with flaming coals inside so we could each roast our own marshmallows. Along with the meal, I ordered a couple cold beers from their domestic menu and it was served in a fat glass mug. The mugs were pretty unique, almost like a huge coffee mug made out of glass.  Unfortunately, when you dine in Old Town Scottsdale right along Scottsdale Road, you are going to pay for it. The burger plates were fairly pricey, and our tab came to around $100 (that's with only 2 beers) for 5 people. Of course, we did order an appetizer and dessert, but a $13 burger is not something I am willing to pay for very often. However, you have to understand, you are paying for the ambience and atmosphere. You're right along Scottsdale Road, in a great location, and the bar had a pretty cool layout, as one side was inside the restaurant, and the other side was on the patio. On the other hand, I was not too fond of the bathroom layout. The bathroom was extremely tight, and I almost had no shoulder room between myself and the guy standing next to me. But ultimately, the restaurant was nice, the booths were spacious and gave my family of 5 plenty of room to get comfortable around the table.  The service at the restaurant was overall pretty good. The waitresses were all extremely attractive (as one would expect at an establishment like this), and our server was very nice and prompt, I think her name was Kylie, or something similar. We did not have to wait to be seated (we beat the night crowd) and the food did not take very long to come out. Overall, I'll give the place 4 stars. Food was great, service was good, and servers were great to look at. If you don't mind paying for a $13 burger, this is definitely one place to check out. [501 words]",

    "text": "What a terrible experience. As a first time customer to this location (who has been dying to check out this place) I can say with confidence that I won't be back. Went here for lunch today for a coworkers last day in the office. We had reservations since there was a fairly large party of us (12). The table was set up which was great, the server was taking our drink orders within few minutes of sitting down - also great! Downhill from here.....we waited over an hour for our food. During the hour time frame our server never came back to see if we needed another drink, let us know they were super busy, or ask how we were. When we FINALLY got our food more than half of the table's food was cold, including mine. The burger was barely first pee in the morning warm. The tater tots looked (and tasted) like they had been sitting out for 4 days. The \"split\" between fries and tots as a side ended up coming out as a side of fries, and a side of tots. The BBQ which was supposed to be on the side of my burger (since I didn't want it on the burger) was no where to be found - kinda like our server after she dropped off the food. An hour to wait for the food and it was 15 minutes after the meals were dropped off that the busboy was already taking people's plates, whether they were done or not.   All and all a completely overpriced place with mediocre food and terrible service.",

They have about a million TVs, but the few times I've been they are all playing the same game (maybe mix it up a little? There were certainly other games going on on the days we went). They were accommodating when we requested a particular game, but they stuck us at a table directly in front of the TV they used so we were going a little cross-eyed watching it. Parking can be tough because it's Old Town, but there's a garage not too far away. It gets busy during sports season, so be ready to wait for a table if a big game is on. We'll definitely be back, but it's not always my first choice.",

    "text": "This review is somewhat unfair. I did go with a giant group of Yelpers, so I cannot say if the most excellent and amazing service was due to that, or if it is always like that, but I can say that, at least that night, the service was wonderful. The manager (who seemed to be one of the yelper's friends possibly?) was amazing. He was attentive without being overbearing and he remembered all of our names... that's right, like 25 of our names.... that is insanity! We came for happy hour and build your own burgers and happy it was! They had many delicious beers on tap, with the local beers being on special for 4$. I had a Four Peaks peach... it was delish, as per usual. The build your own burger deal is pretty amazing, you fill out an order form with all of the toppings you would like for 10$. I think I put too many toppings on....here is the run down on my ridic burger:  Pretzel bun Angus beef gruyere and cheddar cheese roasted tomato, caramelized onion, roasted green chilis, jalapenos, guac steakhouse butter bacon over easy egg hot sauce... on the side.  That's right... this was burgerious maximus. Unfortunately, when the burger came out it was missing several of the toppings (including the bacon, blasphemy!) and the over easy egg was nearly cooked through. This was a little disappointing, but maybe was a blessing, because this burger was monsterous, hard to eat, a total mess, and delicious the way it was. Would I like bacon next time? Yes, definitely. But I will try to edit myself....*try* being the operative word. I could only eat half and I was sooo full. I also had sweet potato tots.. they were good, but after trying someone else's chips...those are definitely the way to go.   As others have mentioned, they have a great Yelp check in special... 5$ off, and they honored it for all of us, which was totally unnecessary, but much appreciated. I will gladly return!",

We were data immediately and received our menus and told a server would be right with us. We were sat at a table right next to the bar.  10 minutes later, no one had shown up yet to greet us or take our drink order. We flagged down one of the 2 girls running the host/hostess table at the entrance and let her know that our server had not been by yet. She apologized and said she would send someone over. We then watched another table get sat 2 tables away, have a server come to them first, take their drink order, receive their drinks and not once did anyone come by our table.   We decided to get up and leave at this point. Best part is what happens next. As we begin to walk out, 2 guys who were cleaning the tables came to our table and cleaned up the menus and our build a burger orders that we have prepared within 30 seconds of us standing up and leaving the table. Also, as we are leaving the 2 girls at the front were just standing laughing, having a fun time on their phones giggling and laughing.  They both told good-bye and have a great night. My wife then responded back \"No one ever came to take our order!\"  We went down the street to ReHab Burger. Was greeted immediately and sat at a table. Server came within 1 minute and we had drinks on the table within 3 minutes.  If you actually want to drink \"cold beer\" and eat \"cheeseburgers\", I would go to ReHab instead.",

The beer was cold, as advertised, and the burger was tasty.  Not the best I've ever had by any means, but a solid cheeseburger worthy of being included in the namesake.  Our waitress was on top of it, despite having what appeared to be ten different groups she was waiting on, and the crowd was a nice mix of Scottsdale randoms.    It's possible that I'm giving the 4th star due to the company I was surrounded by (Rick / Jon / Amy / Jolly / Heath / Laura / Jeff / Becky) - we shared some very interesting conversation as a little sendoff for our pal Rick who was visiting from N.C.  On this day, we learned that there are still people in their 30's rocking aol e-mail addresses... HA!

They were kind of dried out. The sauce was like they pulled something out of the fridge that was made last week. If you can't get frigging enchiladas right, you're done with us. The black beans had an odd taste as if rubber was melted in the pot with them?  My wife's Loco Protein bowl was uneventful. She couldn't put her finger on anything being bad, but said it's one of those things that if you were starving, opened the fridge and it was sitting there, she'd eat it.  Our take-away is that your prices are WAY overboard to serve this kind of dog food.",

    "text": "My experience with this establishment was 'meh', at best. My friend and his girlfriend took me to this establishment because it was a place that they have been to in the past and their experience was, overall, positive. Not to say it was the dinner of a lifetime, but they did like the buffalo dip there.  When we arrived, the atmosphere itself was bright and a pleasant. There was quite a bit people around due to Spring Training, but we couldn't complain...that's why we were there, ha. Everything from the environment, layout, and cleanliness of the place was fine. It was a casual, comfortable atmosphere. The issues of our time were really brought on due to service.   THE WAITRESS Alright, first things first, I am not going to mention any names. At the end of the day, she is a person, everyone makes mistakes, and our experience with her may differ from others who have had her in the past (or future). My impression of her was that she was fairly new. When she arrived at our table, the three of us all felt a little shocked. Her clothing choice was...not what we expected? She may not have noticed but her shirt was a crop-top with a very sloping front. It essentially, when down that low, looked like a sports bra... Now, to each their own, but I will say it did make us a bit uncomfortable for her to be wearing revealing clothing to such a degree. If it were a Twin Peaks (or) Hooters, totally would get it, but we just were caught off guard with so many kids/families around. It appeared she was the only one dressed this way (or this little) but, in the end, this I guess is based on the restaurant's dress code. If they're okay with it, it doesn't really affect me. I'm just a passerby in this situation.  When she was taking our drink orders, one person in our party had requested what she would recommend since our friend has never ordered a drink here before. She didn't really offer any advice, however. She simply stated she was only 20 and couldn't offer any suggestions to us. That was that. She didn't really engage or offer to ask someone that would help us. You would think someone that has 'Cold Beer' in the title, giving some education on alcoholic drinks would be given. I'm glad this woman doesn't condone underage drinking, but why wouldn't she ask what she liked and told the bartender/someone 21+ working? Anyway, she brought the person in our party a refresher because a lot of people buy it, of which she had  1/2 than stopped because she doesn't like basil.  THE CHIP FIASCO We had the buffalo chicken dip with chips and it was fine. It is got QUITE a kick to it, so be aware. It's very much on the spicier end. We also noticed that they didn't really give a lot of chips with it. We weren't even halfway done before we ran out. We asked for me, the waitress obliged, and we had a little bucket, probably slightly smaller than my fist worth. We asked for one more just because it was so little, she obliged. All that said, when we received the bill...we noticed we were being charged for them. Something the waitress made no attempt to even mention. When my friend questioned his bill she was kind of put off and said you get one free but after that we were going to be charged for additional appetizers. Which, does make sense, but I believe my friend was a little perturbed nothing was said. Why was that not mentioned when we ordered them?  In the end, he did speak with the manager and the issue was resolved. The manager made the point, \"if we charged for free amount of chips we'd probably be out of business.\" Not certain how relevant or factual that statement is, but we reiterated to him it was not the issue of charging it was the issue no one told us \"the rules\". We were just asking because we were out and received a very limited quantity in ratio to the amount of dip. I thought the remark was a bit uncalled for since none of us were being loud, mean, or angry... We were just curious why no one said anything. We didn't really give an aggressive tone to be retaliated against. It was just weird.  Clearly, our experience was disappointing. The food was alright. The drinks were okay-priced, but the service we received was really what put a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure I'll return to this place. I'm sad because it was \"vacation time\" for me and this wasn't really a fun stop-off like we were hoping. Plus, I hate writing bad reviews, but I honestly couldn't in good conscious give this place more than two stars based on our experience.",

    "text": "Worst service. I called in a to go order at 10:15 (veggie burger and truffle fries) she said it would be 15 minutes until my order was ready. I arrived at 10:30. They did not tell me anything was wrong with my order until 10 minutes later when I had to ask the server who dodged me so I had to flag down a manager. At this point it is now 10:45. the manager comes over and precedes to tell me he gave my order to ANOTHER ALLI....unacceptable. The manager who was not wearing a name tag. Clearly against the code of conduct he signed upon hiring. Told me it would be another 10 minutes. A few minutes later I asked the bartender if that was my  order they were carrying out  and she responds condescendingly \"what's your name... No that's not\". The manager finally after 15 additional minutes brought my food up. At the hosts stand where I was suppose to pay I ask him if he can do anything for the inconvenience and he proceeds to call me babe and shout to the entire restaurant I was only trying to get a free meal. This location lacks staff with basic social competence and customer services. I am seriously appalled that someone would look at me and imply that I could not afford a $15 dollar check and scream to the restaurant about me. The fact is the restaurant was empty and now I can see why. Thanks for the cold food and lackluster help from the wait staff and misogynistic manager who I will never know the name of because fundamental inability to comply to company regulations.",

The real WOW factor came when my son ordered the tabletop s'mores. It came out with a small fire in a ceramic mug, a few more than a half dozen marshmallows, a bar of chocolate, and a bunch of graham crackers.

I asked her if she can make make me another, her response: \"you can order something else if you didn't like it.\"  Okaaaayyy... I'm guessing she doesn't know how to make this specific drink??   We were seated at this point so I ordered their version of Bloody Mary. It was, meehh... I had a few sips. We ordered the origins tots with guac, chili, and sour cream. They were okay, nothing out of this world. It was too salty for my pallet.   The ambiance was good. They have a lot of TVs with different sports playing on them. Good crowd in general, a good mix of twenty somethings all the way to fifty somethings.   Our server was great. She stopped by to check on us frequently, was courteous.   Overall, I would recommend this place if you're looking for a fun hang out with friends. It's not for gourmet food and drinks.  I had a good time with my friend.

My 3 co workers and I walked to Evan Stevens for lunch by it was pretty crowded and we didn't want to get our food and go back to the office. We decided to check out Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.   We got there at exactly 12:40. I ordered a pint of Octoberfest Sam Adams and a turkey burger with the house chips. One of us order chicken tenders and fries. Another person ordered a Chicago dog and house chips. Someone else ordered whatever burger features BBQ sauce and bacon. I can't remember the name. My beer and the waters came out immediately. Around 1:30 we said .... man, it's pretty crowded for a Friday afternoon, maybe that's what's taking so long. Around the same time someone (assuming a manager) said our food will be out shortly. I finished my beer, slowly around 2. Again, we got there at 12:40. When I finished my beer at 2, the server asked if I needed another and reassured us the food would be coming out shortly.   About 10 mins or so later, our food arrived. My turkey burger looked and smelled AMAZING. The house chips were cooked in old grease and tasted a little stale. My co workers chicken tenders were extra crispy and dark, almost as if they were cooked previously and thrown back in the grease. My other co worker said her hotdog roll was also stale. What a bummy lunch. We didn't feel the need to complain about anything because when looking around we noticed that we only saw maybe 3 serves for the entire restaurant so clearly they weren't expecting such a lunch run we're assuming.   We quickly ate our lunches and left because we were then late for a 2:00 meeting. We should have went waited at Evan's. However, I loved my turkey burger. It was so flavorful, the house chips not so much. I'd visit again if I'm in the area and have no time restraints.",

The drinks weren't strong enough but it was a nice time nonetheless! I really enjoy the spot and we'll go back again.",

We could not get anyone to turn the game back on and we were given the response that it's not \"their job\" to put the game back on. We missed the end of the game and were cursed at and threatened by multiple staff members including the server, bartender as well as the manager. If you are True sports fan do not go to this bar.

But the real \"OH MY\" was the women outside on the patio kind of next to us changing the baby diaper on the chair at the table. No manager around... So if you go wear your glasses to inspect their glasses and then take off the glasses so you don't get to see what's going on a round you.  Won't be back.  There's so many other butter places.",

Their beers taste so refreshing and great my fiance and I were shocked because a normal beer we'd always get tasted better here! We got the buffalo dip it was huge! We didn't love it because it was a little overwhelming but it was still good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because our burgers weren't cooked the way EITHER of us were ASKED.. and Grace wasn't that great of a server. She had no type of personality what's so ever and she didn't really seem to care to help us.. getting our orders not as accurate didn't help either. She came to check on us maybe once or twice but was no where to be found until she was handing us the check. All in all, the burgers were amazing tho and the beer definitely led up to the name!",

I first stopped by this place and met some co-workers for drinks.  We didn't order any food, but there were several items that caught my eye and I knew next time I came I would order them!  So I came about couple of weeks later.  My wife and i wanted a burger, sandwich, or some hearty type of meal, so i knew this would be the perfect place.  The first time I came here i saw some awesomeness that had to do with tater tots and found out they were called Original Tot chos.  My wife and I split that, she also ordered the All American, and I decided to go all out and get the O-Linemen.  The food and service was awesome.  The Tot chos were on point, very similar to nachos of course, but without the chips.  My wife's burger was great and mine was awesome.  I pounded about half the sandwich, it was even a little too much for me.  As you can see from the photo's, bring your appetite cause the food is very filling.  The prices were very reasonable and the food was delicious.  This place is great to watch games or hangout for drinks, also a nice place to take your lady for some good food.  I know there are several locations across the valley, give this place a try, it's well worth it!",

Honestly, I can't remember anything particular that made it really stand out, but it was solid nonetheless.  I stopped back in again recently, and really liked it! Maybe I'm exaggerating but it seemed like the menu had expanded & they had more to offer during HH. I also came on a Wednesday, which is when this place offers unlimited toppings on burgers for $11. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to drink during this visit but it did look like they had a large beer selection.  My friend & I started with a pretzel. It was soft & chewy & I LOVED the cheese sauce that came with it (it was peppery so it had a little kick to it). As far as my burger went, it was good but honestly nothing super great (I think it was the bun...it was a bit stale). The beef tasted fresh though (as well as the toppings) and was cooked the way I ordered.   Our server was good & knew the menu. I liked the atmosphere as well. It's basically an Old Town version of a sports bar (and I mean that as a good thing).  I'll be back!",

I know the manager, Tracy, from the last restaurant he was at - he took great care of me there, and if it's possible, even better care of me here! Wow - I feel like a rockstar in this place! I was sharing with my lunch group Saturday - I really tend to avoid Old Town - but based on how both groups I was with last week were treated, it will be impossible for me not to frequent the place.  The servers are on the ball and don't seem to lose patience - even with large groups splitting the check multiple ways.  All food was delivered as ordered, the quality and flavor are solid and the portions generous. I am not going to make suggestions - I don't think you can go wrong anywhere on the menu.   Oh, wait. One suggestion. The Hellfire Chips  on the appetizer menu. House made chips, buffalo sauce, blue cheese. So good! Its a really large serving - so either split it as a group, or plan on that being the majority of your meal. But WOW - so simple, but delish!  Thank you, CB&CB - and thank you, Tracy - for making sure we all (in both groups) had a great experience and look forward to coming back!)",

    "text": "I'd actually give 3.5 if that was an option.  The location is pretty awesome with plenty of parking in the garage out back and a few in the tiny lots surrounding the place.  They have a nice patio to look out onto Scottsdale Rd from.    The beer selection is pretty amazing and it seems like they usually run a beer special.  The menu has a lot of items on it, not just burgers but we didn't really try anything else yet.  The burgers were solid with not too much grease, though it was close.  They were cooked to order which is good and came with home made chips that were pretty darn good.    The dessert was confusing because they have a brownie sundae and a brownie shake; we ordered the sundae but it was pretty much a shake that hasn't been mixed?  I'm not sure why but the ice cream was kind of more shake-y than scoop-y like it was blended, and it all came in a sundae glass.  The brownie was cut into large bite-size squares which was a little too large to chew comfortably even without a bit of \"ice cream\" in the mix.  We eventually just got a to-go cup so we can pour it in and freeze it at home.    Ultimately this is a solid food place that could be fun.  Don't expect any kind of value pricing though, everything is pretty much priced out to the max of what people would be willing to pay.  At least the food isn't terrible, which is often the case in Scottsdale along with prices as high!",

I actually asked the hostess to have a server come over and after waiting an additional 15 minutes, we decided to leave. Never in my life have I had an experience like this- I was absolutely livid! What kind of a restaurant, which wasn't busy at all the night I went in, wouldn't have someone come over at all in 30 minutes?!

Considering it was 100, it was pretty comfortable! The food was great, but the service was horrendous. We had some girl wearing a hippie-type headband halfway down her forehead, who apparently didn't think we were worthy of her attention. I got there and waited 10 minutes for her to take my drink order. It then took another 10 minutes for her to bring my drink. After that, we didn't see her for 30 minutes. We had no water and empty glasses. She kept looking over at us, but never once asked if we needed anything. We had previously told her that we wanted to order food but weren't ready. Finally we flag her down to order more drinks and food. The food is brought by someone else, and the drinks arrive 10 minutes after the food. She didn't check on us once while we were eating. We had to then again flag her down to get the check, which took 30 minutes. We had the cards ready, so at least that was quick, but she never refilled our water (we were outside!), and didn't come back or acknowledge our existence. This was such a disappointing experience, as I've been there multiple times before and have never had bad service.",

I think I did, but another 10 minutes of waiting, I get my beer with an excuse of \"backup at the bar.\" I'm not buying that at all. Then, while the game was going, I kept getting bumped and pushed from where I was sitting. I almost wanted to ask the table next to me if they were having the same issue, but I was already frustrated at that point.

    "text": "I visited Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers on March 2, 2015. This is nothing new considering this is one of my favorite spots to dine. I live in Glendale so it is quite a drive but it was always worth it until my most recent visit. I sat at the bar between 3:00 and 4:30 p.m. with my boyfriend. The bartender was female and was a tall skinny brunette. My boyfriend and I both ordered a beer so naturally she asked for our ID's. She checked my boyfriends first and gave it back and then asked for mine. I gave her my ID and she proceeded to ask for a second form so I gave her a card with my name and mentioned that I had a school picture ID as well. The bartender then walks away and goes to talk to the manager. The manager them comes and walks around the bar with my ID in his hand trying to sneakily look at me. A few minutes later the bartender comes back and tells me she and her manager do not think that I'm the person in the ID and that she will not be serving me. I am now in shock because it is in fact me and I had 5 other forms of ID on me. Not to mention, the manager took one glance at me rather than trying to match my facial features to the ones in the ID. I work in the industry as a server and bartender in fact I only work about a block away. I understand she was trying to do her job but there was absolutely no reason for her to decline my ID and tell me that it isn't me. I was even more upset that after this the manager didn't come over and speak to me nor did the bartender ever come back with my boyfriend's drink or to offer us food. This bartender was extremely rude and had terrible customer service as well as the manager on duty at that time. As someone who has worked in the industry for 6 years I have never seen this poor of customer service. This is sad considering they have great drinks and food. I also worry because around this time people are coming into town for spring training and are going to be awfully disappointed when this bartender turns down their ID because she deems it as fake.",

The trivia nights on Thursdays are fun. At 9PM they hand out score cards and the trivia questions are on the TV. A lot of people get into it and it lasts quite a while. The service is really great. There was only one incident last week when we were waiting way too long to get our check. I had to go to the hostess to ask for it because our server was MIA. No big deal though, every other time I've been there I haven't had any problems. Last time our server was Bippie... I have no idea if that was her real name, but either way she was awesome. We were there for about two hours and she always made sure we had something to drink. I definitely recommend checking this place out. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, it does get loud sometimes. On a busy night, it's better to be seated in the outside section if it's not too hot, as it is a little quieter than inside.",

Have been here three times and every time it got consistently worse! First time it took 25 min and 3 servers to get a second glass of wine. Food was terrible and was sent back after looking at it! I ordered their fancy grilled cheese which came cold with half ingredients missing and looked like a 5 yearold made it! Second time we came the serve asked for drink order came back twenty min later we still didn't have drinks and came by asking if we were ready to order drinks to which we replied we already did at that point she realized that she forgot to put the order in.  We were understanding since it was first week of football and they were busy.third time must have been the worse. We ordered wings as an app and they actually would have tasted great if they were hot. They were barely warm and looked like they sat in the kitchen forgotten for awhile. We had to wait at least 25 min for drinks and that's even if the waitress asked if we needed more. Each time she would come around she would ask one person without looking around and asking the others if they needed anything. We finally ordered food and one of the items was completely wrong. The serve told the girl she will take off the bill then came back and said her manage didn't approve the comp and was just going to change the price to the item she got!!!! Are you serious??? At this point the whole table was so upset about the whole experience that we asked tho see the manager. He was very apologetic and comped the whole bill after making excuses about the whole situation. Shocking we still went back(due to some friends wanting to check the place out) and this is why this review is 2 stars and not 1. We got the same serve as last time which was awkward at first but she definitely redeemed her self and was on top of her game. The manager remembered us and got us a round of drinks and asked how everything was. I am hoping that they are on the right track and that the service continues getting better and hopefully the managers continue execute great customer service. I will continue editing this review to higher stars if they continue doing a great job.",

    "text": "Been here four times now... First time made a great impression. Mom got the Prime dip and I got the chili mac with the intention of us splitting each dish to try. When lunch came out, we devoured the chili mac without even touching the prime dip. It was soooooo delicious! Boxed up the prime dip and mom took it home to dad. Even after the trip back home to the west side, dad said it was still really good. Second time wasn't as good of an experience. My husband and I came on a Saturday night and it was a disaster. Employees were hanging out at the bar, taking up at least 5-6 seats at the bar, drunk and being obnoxious. The place was packed and management didn't ask them to make room for customers. On top of that, a man sitting at a table on the patio with a group of people kept coming back behind the bar getting himself and his friends drinks. I'm not sure if he was an owner or manager, but regardless, not setting a good example for the employees. Third time I came for my birthday lunch. Had a great time with great service. The tot-chos are Aaa-ma-zzzzing! I could've eaten the whole plate! Shared the rocky point burger (it's huge) and it was 'good'. Fourth time, again came for lunch. Sat at the bar with a fairly busy lunch crowd. The manager had to tell the two bartenders, who were apparently involved in a very interesting conversation, to bring us menus. Once they realized we were there, service was terrific. Of course had the tot-chos again and devoured them. Had the Monterey chicken sandwich and it was really good. Overall, I think if you come here for lunch, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a place to grab a bite on a weekend night, come early or be prepared to get ice thrown at you and drinks spilled all over the bar.",

    "text": "I gave them 2 stars based on service I received on previous visits. But sadly it is becoming obvious that poor management is going to pull this place down like so many other old town bars.  I stood and watched a $10 an hour manager wearing a Moss jersey, offend every potential money spending guest. We watched him escort other bar industry types past the people who placed their names on the wait list.  Being in the industry myself, I realized that none of these people were spending money. Their drinks and food were not being rang up on checks.  They were getting their free drinks and food first; while the people with money to spend were completely ignored.  Not a winning business model.  But hey.. the investors get what they paid for and my group along with about 35 other guests left to spend their money elsewhere.  We ended up at Derby.  The food was on par with Cold beers and Cheesebugers. The service was wonderful. We had an adorable, charming and attentive server.  I watched the Steelers beat the Packers, so the day ended on a high note and we all had a wonderful afternoon.   I own a home in Old Town and am a year round resident that enjoys eating out 3 or 4 times a week. This summer when all these places are empty, and their employees  can't pay their rent, the Derby folks  should send a thank you note to the management of Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers for the 25% tips they  get from their new regular.",

A friend of mine ordered a burger that had two grilled cheeses as the bun. Literally insane, he loved every bite. Jordan, our server, served us both times and was very attentive and even remembered us. Perfect location for people wanting to go out in Old Town and enjoy a great atmosphere with great food and drink.

They have a location up in the Pinnacle Peak & Grayhawk area and when I heard they were coming down to Old Town, I had to come try it for myself.   We walked into the joint and sat down at the bar.  The bartenders here are very friendly and helped us navigate the menu and gave us some suggestions.  We decided to order:  Hot & Smokey Mac & Cheese, $12 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=mmielx6jnDdPHjhsRq5JTg#mmielx6jnDdPHjhsRq5JTg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cold...</a>  Chili Mac & Cheese, $10 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=62XM74Smxg1lNsSu8nE2_g#62XM74Smxg1lNsSu8nE2_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cold...</a>  Cheeseburger Sliders, $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=hZ5V7OBUDJSOjuQEVDinLw#hZ5V7OBUDJSOjuQEVDinLw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cold...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=-Ux2s-3A70ZZzw3UulAUgg#-Ux2s-3A70ZZzw3UulAUgg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cold...</a>  Prime Rib Sliders, $12 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cold-beers-and-cheeseburgers-old-town-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=teUmvafQzMflGzwqB0BUxw#teUmvafQzMflGzwqB0BUxw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cold...</a>  While we waited for the food, I ordered a pint of Lagunitas IPA, $6....one of my favorite IPA's.  The food came out a short time later.  The first thing I did was try the Hot & Smokey Mac & Cheese....and holy smokes, it was delish!  Not only that, but it really was spicy too...and smokey!  I also had a bite of the Chili Mac & Cheese...that was ridiculously good as well!  Next, I tried the Sliders....had the Cheeseburger Slider first....also very well prepared and full of flavor.  The Prime Rib Sliders were just as good and the Horseradish Sauce was a zinger that added to the flavor!  We were very impressed with this place.  After dinner we watched some baseball and had another Beer.  Good times down here...can't wait to come back.  Return Factor - 100%",

    "text": "Reviewed a year ago previously. Used to be our favorite place to watch college & NFL football and baseball. They still have good food and bartenders but the manager who manages and controls the tv's on Saturday is a rude and ignorant individual who has some of the worst customer service skills I've ever encountered in The entire Valley. He is consistently a miserable obese person to everyone he speaks to .....may it be customers and the employees working for him. Someone with CBCB needs to sit him down and tell him to get off his high horse and explain to him that he's just a bar manager and that he needs an attitude adjustment.  I am Project Manager and have worked for some of biggest Industrial General contractors and have never spoken to anyone beneath me or above me with tone and attitude that person has had with myself and other patrons just having simple requests to just put a game on the tv in their general vicinity. He doesn't hesitate to respond with a rude comment or facial smirk when he is approached.  I'm sure we are not the only ones that feel this way because on numerous occasions I've heard comments about his bad attitude from other patrons. His attitude this past week was more than we want deal anymore and are going to watch Saturday and Sunday football at another establishment along with our friends and family.",

I'm a beer snob and actually do know my beers.  They have a decent selection of high volume beers and I was delighted to see some of my favs on their list.    The patio is huge and there are tons of tvs.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great spot to watch sports.  Now, it's not cheap.  You do pay a bit for a burger.  However, the burgers are enormous.  I couldn't finish my truffle burger so perhaps splitting one between two would help you feel like less of a pig and allow more cash for beers!",

They have a great beer selection on tap and in bottles.  Happy Hour specials include reduced rates on beer, well drinks and some appetizers.  The Hummus & Pita plate and Grilled Asparagus was a greater starter.    By the recommendation of the Bartender, I went with the Golden Mustard Grilled Drummettes.  OMG so delicious! Best combination of sweet and spicy.  Another bonus: you get Blue Cheese dressing.  The BYOB Mac n' Cheese options are amazing.  Not only does it come with American, Pepper Jack and Provolone, but you can add another cheese.  They have several meat options such as Bacon, Ground Chuck and Chicken.    This will be a great place to watch sports.  They have so many TVs it's hard to focus on one screen.  I cannot wait to come back and check out the huge patio.  This will be a great spot for some day drinking.",

I stopped in with my boyfriend and a friend on a Friday afternoon around happy hour time and we were looking to have a good dinner in a fun environment before heading into the old town bars for the night.  We were able to grab seats at the bar even though the restaurant was almost full. We were served by a couple of really friendly and helpful bartenders. They explained the happy hour specials and helped us pick out some good beers.  What a great beer selection, and I loved the mugs they served the beer in. It was just fun to drink out of.  The whole place was boisterous and had a really fun and happy vibe. We ordered an appetizer which I think was chips with some kind of cheese and nacho type topping. Whatever it was it was delicious!   I ordered the veggie burger as my meal and I'm SO glad I did! Holy cow their veggie burger is incredible. The bartender told me she recommends it to people regardless of whether or not they are vegetarians because it's so good.  On the menu, it says that if you like the food you can add a beer to your tab for the kitchen staff when they are done with their shift. What a great idea! I bet they're drunk every night because the food was incredible. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Sports bars with great service are bank in my book. Often, I visit ones where the rowdy action that's happening on TV and throughout the bar gives servers an excuse to neglect your dining needs or act hurried in their interactions, but I'm pleased to say Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers in Old Town Scottsdale is a great exception to this rule.  I went there recently to watch the Indiana Pacers beat the Miami Heat (woo!) and had a great time chilling out on the mister-filled patio. We had prime seating in front of a large flat-screen television and a cool view of Old Town Scottsdale. Now I know why the patio is constantly packed whenever I drive by - the place has great food, a killer happy hour, 25 TVs and service with a smile.  One of the things that's greatest about Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers is that their happy hour lasts until 7 p.m., and starts at 3 p.m. It features great specials, including $3 domestic pints and $5 appetizers.   As the restaurant name implies, the beer list is huge, but my favorite part about the meal was the delicious grilled cheese sandwich and side salad. The sandwich comes with fries or chips for $8, and with my salad, it was only $10. This was great bar food, a huge portion, with three types of cheeses and tomato. I added avocado, which is my favorite way to have it. I was impressed with the fresh salad, and left taking half my sandwich home.  My companion's Turkey Burger ($12) also looked generous, and he said it tasted graet. I stole some of his sweet potato tots (an extra $2), and they were worth the splurge - perfectly crispy and, again, a massive portion that had him taking half the meal home.   Throughout the night, I was pleasantly surprised any server that passed by our table checked on us. Servers should work as a team, helping out each other's tables with whatever they need, and that's the philosophy here - really impressive.  The atmosphere was fun, with friendly banter and cheering among tables for the games. It's casual and unpretentious, yet you'll feel valued and have a great meal. Also, be sure to \"check in\" on Yelp, Facebook or Twitter to score 10 percent off your bill.",

I think maybe she didn't want to work or was having a shitty day.  Go to rehab burger down the street wayyyyyy better.  Gave it two stars(generously) because good atmosphere game volume was on. The hostess didn't even say bye when we left she was just texting not even looking up.  Good luck surviving in Old Town CB & CB. Teach your staff MANAGER!!",

Btw, they went chatting and laughing the whole time and could care less about customers needs.  Not a fan of this place!",

They have the Sonoran White Chocolate Ale on tap, which is my favorite beer of all time, so I give them some credit for having a good local beer selection. Overall, I liked the space, the patio is huge and great for warm days/nights. I wanted to sit outside, but I came with a larger group, 8 of us, and we were fortunate enough to find a table inside to accommodate us right before the UA v ASU basketball game. I ordered the CB&CB burger which was good, but doesn't rank as one of the best burgers I've ever had, but I would come back to grab a Sonoran Ale and watch another game.",
