    "text": "Good food; Bad Flies; So-So Service.  Tried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way.  We tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an \"interesting\" taste.  The most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.    When your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive!  Waitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana.  Would visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own.",

    "text": "Decent. No wow factor.  My girlfriend received a $50 gift card for Christmas, so I checked the menu online and we went on a Thursday. Decently busy, but not packed. I rarely carry cash and was disappointed that we were FORCED to use valet.   We were greeted and seated warmly and quickly. No issues there. I did notice that the menu prices were around 20% higher than what was listed on their website, which was disappointing. But, eh.  The server was very good. She stated specials, and fielded pertinent questions. She was friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. No issues there.  What we chose for an appetizer was an entree special. While it was delicious, I couldn't imagine it as a stand alone entree. Two seared sea scallops over white beans and sauteed greens. But for $14 it was good.  The entrees were very tasty. My girlfriend had tortolloni  and I had strozzapreti on the servers recommendation. The dishes were very flavorful and portions were decent size. So again, no issues with the pasta, except after about 4 or 5 bites, there was a hair. Yay. I don't get overly wigged out about such things, but that was a major, major ding on the experience. I just hope the person washed their hair prior to work. LOL  For the most part it was decent. The food quality (other than the hair) is quite good. The atmosphere is very bistro, and slightly stuffy, though it's supposed to be more casual, IMO. The prices are out of line, but that's the case with all of Sam's concepts. And it's reminiscent of the Yard in terms of layout. Overplayed.  I admire Sam for his success, but I've been to almost all of his places and I'm just not that impressed. Others clearly are, but I'm not. Having been in the industry for 30 years myself, I've worked for a number of successful concepts, and mostly I think his stuff is overrated, and overpriced.",

    "text": "I never like strolling into a restaurant near their closing time but we arrived maybe 915p they close at 10p and we didn't feel rushed or like it was an inconvenience for the staff. I've been here when it's busy but it was quiet, maybe a few people at the bar and another table then us (it's a Monday). I can appreciate it both ways, the food is excellent regardless. Our server, Mitchell, was very attentive, proactive, down to earth and friendly - got our orders perfect. Mussels were great, the Caesar salad a bit spicy but good and fig and prosciutto pizza I loved. Warm goat cheese, there's nothing better. On top of the food I just like North for the ambience with the cool lighting, the open kitchen and high ceiling. It's almost like you are dining at someone's farm house:) we will be back.",

Other memorable dishes (and I tried almost everything): - Burrata appetizer - Zucca chips, surprisingly - Strozzapreti - spicy salami on the board - Kale salad - Arancini - Meatballs - Prosciutto Fig pizza  The Branzino was too salty for me and I thought their desserts fell a bit short. But that's comparing critically with food in LA. Overall still a great place and we went twice on this trip and will go again!",

    "text": "Last night was AMAZING! It was our first time at North and not only was it delish but it also had fabulous service!  I was debating between the margarita pizza and the fig prosciutto pizza and our waiter Ryan told me to get the fig prosciutto and let me tell you that was the best suggestion ever! The dough was clearly homemade with lots of love and was so incredibly soft I made the whole table try some! And the balance between the salty prosciutto and sweet figs and bitter arugula was out of this world. Then when it came time for dessert we pretty much wanted the whole menu but we ordered the gelato and the donut puffy yummy things that start with a B! Our server Ryan however didn't think that was good enough and brought us his favorite (the olive oil cake). They were all amazing! This place can do no wrong! I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants a great environment, Classic Italian food with a twist and awesome service (request Ryan!)",

    "text": "This is my favorite of the Sam Fax concepts.  North has been revamped and is now more rustic.  It's a huge, huge improvement over the old North.  I have been to the Kierland, 40th Street and Tucson locations.    The Good:  We love the location on 40th Street.  We usually go on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  We like to sit at the bar and the bar tenders are all super friendly.  We also like the wine special, don't know what that says about us.  There are so many good choices on the menu.  The pasta is all handmade.  The pizza's are excellent and they have a good selection of wines.  The Tucson location is beautiful and there is a great view from the patio.  The Bad:  For some reason some of my favorite items from the menu are not available at the Kierland location.  Also, the lasagne is not very good, I would avoid it.",

    "text": "So I am super conflicted about this place.  The service is excellent, you get free valet parking.  The decor is great, open kitchen, and just a great ambiance.  Then you have excellent tasting food. But my personal issue is that the food tastes are not my type of food, most of the foods have a more sour type taste like vinegar and lemon.  You can tell it's great food though.  I did not try the pizza but it looked really good.  I was just too full from everything else.  Here are the things I had (we had 17 people and they treated us really well).  Calamari - with lemons, but it's a lemon sauce not fried lemons like they seem to suggest, I didn't like it cuz of the lemons but it would have been great otherwise  Nutella Triffle - I normally don't do dessert but since it was my birthday I did.  This thing is great!  Three layers of chocolate, nutella and graham crackers. with hazel nuts on top. Yum!  Scallops and Risotto, well cooked scallops with a good risotto, a bit thinner than I prefer my risotto but I like it thicker than it normally comes.  Tortellini  with Spinach, this thing was really good, nice dense tortellini and greatly cooked spinach.  All in all, I'd come back and try the pizzas next time, but if you are into pasta with a zing of lemon, this place is great!",

Everything here is amazing; I have yet to see anyone order a bad dish. For dinner I usually get the salmon or spinach ravioli, yum. Started coming for brunch on the weekends and absolutely love their egg dishes (have had the sandwich, scramble, and frittata) with the awesome crusty bread on the side. :) Probably my latest favorite is the Jump Start - chocolate milk shaken and served cold with 2 espresso shots... so simple but so magical!",

I have had these two dishes in many restaurants and I will totally be back just for these two items!!  There were six of us and everyone raved about their food.

Maybe not the best for a first date, because of the way you have to eat them, but perfect for girl's night! I believe our server's name was Ellie, and her timing was just perfect. She let us have our time, but we also had everything we needed when we needed it! I had the tortellini and I didn't want to send it back, but it was very salty. I did finish it, and there were great flavors, too, but I really wish it weren't so aggressive. Since it was girl's night, we also had dessert!! We really loved the olive oil cake!!!

It's our \"must-go\" place for dinner whenever our friend visits from out of town. We come here quite often that we routinely order our \"usuals\".  Our couple friend always gets the spaghetti & meatballs which our friend claims \"is the best spaghetti & meatballs ever\", margherita pizza and the gluten free bolognese pasta. As for my boyfriend & I, we usually share the \"pig\" pizza & Italian farm salad. Oh and of course, to complete our amazing meal, us four will share a pitcher of their delicious & refreshing red sangria.  I'm usually not a fan of red wines but this is one that I love.   So if you haven't tried this place...definitely DO!!! It's a great place to hang out with friends or a nice date.

We had a group of about sixty (60) people attend, and there was never a moment where my wine glass was empty. However, when it came to the \"serve yourself\" salad and pizza during the middle of the gathering, there were moments where most had to wait for new pizzas to be made (I understand quality control), but once we waited, we ended up walking away with a single piece of pizza and one scoop of salad (little food, a ton of booze - you do the math.)  However, the staff themselves were incredibly friendly and personable, and service can make up for sub-par food delivery.  I will visit again, possibly on an actual dinner reservation.",

    "text": "For those of you Napa fans... It's Press with an Italian twist. What an amazing, open, social atmosphere. Ample bar seating for mingling of the singles scene. Amazing drink menu - my favorite is the \"julietta\".  Definitely worth trying out.  I've been a big fan of the North in Scottsdale for years, and really like that they've mixed things up at this new location. Plenty of great appetizers, salads and pizzas... but my favorite - the house made pastas.  In particular, the short rib gnocchi - it's to die for. I haven't (yet) tried any entree items but they sound great.  So... on the negative side, the only thing I can say is I wish they took reservations.  I use OpenTable at the other North, which is super convenient.  At this location, you have to come in and put your name on the list.  Waits have averaged 30 minutes or so, so plan for that.",

    "text": "I was definitely impressed with the food here. It's like an urban spin on Italian food so sometimes that can go wrong but everything was actually really good. (I didn't know until just now that it was a Fox restaurant, they are all excellent.) I settled on the Mafaldine, a spicy pasta dish with shrimp, which was delicious. My only complaint is that the portion was really small and the shrimp were tiny but I get that the menu is designed to order in courses.  Other favorites at the table were the beet salad, the raviolini, and the pig pizza. In fact the pizza looked so good and I was still hungry so I ordered the verdure pizza to go. Wow, who would've thought that butternut squash, brussell sprouts, and macadamia nuts on a pizza could be so good! And it had that nice char and chewy wood fire crust, amazing. Their food is great but I think the pizza is the ticket here. You really can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Well, I have this soft spot for the FOX restaurant group because they totally nail it when it comes to atmosphere, decor, and a great staff. But I'm learning that while those are their strengths, it's the flavor of the food that's lacking. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad by any means, it's ok or good, but it's not great. I can get GREAT pizza and pasta at some other places in the valley, and they may even be cheaper there. So while FOX gets an A+ in most categories, they need to bring their B to an A in flavor. But this is just my opinion so try it for yourself. It's worth going to and sitting at the outside bar is awesome. I will give it another shot there by ordering some other things on the menu. Would love to prove myself wrong.",

I had the bolognese pasta and he had the spaghetti and meatballs they were both excellent dishes. For desert we had some salted carmel thing I cant remember the name but it was delicious!!!

    "text": "Finally made it over to NoRTH the other night with some friends and had a really great overall experience. The place has been non stop packed since it opened, so I was worried we'd wait forever on a Saturday night but they took our number and told us they would text us (that's new!) when our table was ready. We walked across the street for a drink and before we knew it, text received.  Now while our overall dining experience was positively fabulous, there are a few things that have irked me since, namely, the price as compared to the quantity of food received. The portions are small, but the good kind of small where you don't over-stuff yourself with whatever you're eating. Where portion size is a serious problem however, is with their cocktails. 10 bucks for 6 ounces of booze?!?!?! Super weak. Now in their defense, they had cans of Miller High Life available for 3 bucks apiece but it wasn't really a high life type of evening.   The salads were refreshing. The gnocchi with braised short rib was RIDICULOULSY tasty and the raviolini was excellent as well, however the pizza was good but not amazing. The 2 deserts we shared (holy shit those donuts bro) were also excellent.   Overall, an impressive setup with great food that can be reasonably priced if you order correctly and have your cocktails someplace else. We will definitely be back here, in fact, I think I've talked myself into an extra star. Well done NoRTH!",

We are big fans of North Kierland (we had our 1st date & got engaged here :)) so we decided to try the Arcadia location.  It was great!  The atmosphere was extremely loud as there was a 40th birthday celebration with a group of 15 seated in the center of the restaurant, which made our dinner conversation a lot louder than it should have been. The staff was amazing quick friendly service.  We had the mussels to start and they were delicious!  The dish was served with 2 pieces of bread, which was not enough for the large bowl of broth and we were charged for the additional bread which was disappointing but well worth it.  For our entrees I had the seared scallops with mushroom risotto and at the reccommendation of our server he had the short ribs.  My dish was outstanding and we ending up sharing that as his was just average.  The ribs came with gnocchi which was good except there was very little meat.  My dish had 3 medium sized scallops they were cooked perfectly, but for the price I don't think I'd order again.  Overall the food was good, the atmosphere was far too loud to be considered kid friendly, and the price for the quantity was extremely over priced.",

As a big fan of independent, mom and pop businesses serving up local flavor restaurants, I don't say that very often.  New York Steak The NY steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and deliciously tender.  Not on par with anything from Donovan's or Ruth's Chris, but a solid choice for the money.   Scallops As an avid scuba diver, I love seafood and eat scallops every time I'm near the ocean. These were some of the best I've ever tasted.  Tiramisu I enjoyed the tiramisu, especially the unique way it was served, but I don't feel that it was memorable.  Good, but not great.  Service Our service was attentive without being overbearing.  I appreciated the time our waiter took to review each section of the menu and provide not only suggestions, but commentary on the entrees.",

My fiance had the frittata because he wanted as much veg as possible after his morning run. I enjoyed my sandwich so much that I didn't get a taste of his frittata. The ambiance was great and we had a bottle of Prosecco to enjoy over a leisurely brunch. I wished I had room for something sweet because a lady near us got the apple pie looking thing and it smelled so good. We debated getting a cinnamon roll to go but another diner near us had a half eaten one left on a plate which signaled to me that it was not to die for. So I passed.   My two complaints about the experience were: 1. The parking. was. ridiculous. There was a mostly empty lot but we were forced to use the \"complimentary\" valet. Complimentary my ass. You have to tip. That is not \"complimentary\". They should allow patrons to park themselves if the restaurant lot is less than half full. Otherwise... I might choose to go somewhere else that doesn't rip me off and waste my time with this nonsense. Seriously, I almost asked him to hand me the keys because the car was 20 feet away. Not cool.   2. The bowl for the potatoes with the egg sandwich is beautiful. However, it is not functional. It scoots all over the plate when you try to get a bite and it wobbles like crazy. Frustrating, because the potatoes were delicious but went unfinished because they were such a pain to eat.",

    "text": "In short, it's a good restaurant as long as you don't mind the strict valet parking rules.  This restaurant is very particular on pushing valet parking.  They pretty much make it as a requirement and not as an option, so it's very inconvenient for those who value freedom of choice.  I arrived at this restaurant without knowing the valet requirement, so I did a self-parking. The valet worker there made a big deal out of it.  He tried to school me about legal liability as if he has a PhD in law and just doing a part time valet job during weekend.  I talked to a manager and she eased off the situation and ask valet worker to make it work (who still tried to give me a hard time after manager told him make it work).  It's all nice and smooth after the parking issue was resolved.  Great food, great service.  This restaurant is about quality and value.  The menu is all about choice (which makes their parking rule quite ironic if you ask me).  I would definitely go back again if this restaurant offers choice for parking, but that probably won't happen.  If you don't care about being forced to valet park, then I would say it's a 4-star.  If you do not like being forced on parking, then consider this review a 2 star.",

The modern Italian menu had a lot of great options - we were all struggling with what to order, because everything sounded great.  Note, it's a little pricier than most of my regular lunch haunts, but the food, ambiance and service were worth it.   We started with the zucca chips - yummy fried zucchini chips - sliced thin, lightly salted, yum!  One person ordered the fried cauliflower for her entree - with asparagus and pancetta cream and a fried egg!  And you can add chicken to it for extra protein.   I ended up ordering the Strozzapeti pasta - chicken, mushroom, spinach and pine-nuts with pasta in a creamy sauce.  Wickedly good, but really rich - I could only eat half (and that's unusual!!).     The chicken parmesan was fabulous looking (and big!), the grinder sandwich is also on my list to try, and it is served with potatoes that really look delicious.  The salads were beautiful!  And the prosciutto pizza with figs was a huge hit.    No doubt - I will be back.  I can't wait to introduce the hubby to this venue and try their dinner menu next!

    "text": "Dammit! Why am I the only one who seems to think these Fox Concepts aren't quite as great as they make themselves out to be? Maybe I'm just not cool enough to \"get it,\" or maybe, just MAYBE, I've been to one too many restaurants over the years to the point where I'm able to ignore the showmanship, style, and \"vibe\" of a restaurant, focusing almost solely on how good the food is (or isn't).  My girlfriend and I have visited North Italia on two separate occasions. The first, I'd probably rate as a four star dining experience, with the second trip only coming in at a measly two.  For a Fox Concepts restaurant, the setup is pretty much what you'd expect. Ultra-modern decor, very sleek, hip, and trying to give off the feel of a local restaurant, despite being a pretty large chain that has over nine different locations all over the country.  I'm not a fan of the valet, or what I refer to as \"forced valet,\" meaning that if you want to actually park at the restaurant, you really have no other choice but to use their valet service. Yes, it's convenient, but I don't like being trapped into using a service that I've never felt is necessary. Don't make me get a root canal when all I need is a dental cleaning!  For the first trip, we had a very charming server, who actually went above and beyond to make our first experience a good one. We were given a bowl of free zucca chips, which were excellent. We opted to order some truffle garlic bread as a starter. My girlfriend really liked it, while I've personally never been a big fan of truffle, as it generally stinks and has a bizarre metallic-like scent and flavor that I've never been able to ignore. Additionally, we ordered a bolognese pasta, which was actually far better than what we've had at many other local places (including Nook and Central Bistro). For pizza, we ordered a prosciutto, which included two of our favorite additions: figs and goat cheese. It was decent, although not comparable to some of the more well known pizza establishments in Phoenix.  We were hoping to try this nutella and banana dessert we keep spotting on Yelp, only to find out that they don't have it anymore for unknown reasons. Instead, we ordered the salted caramel budino, which we both were quite impressed with.  For our second trip, almost eight months later, we decided to start with the grilled cauliflower, which included a fried egg, asparagus, bread crumbs, and a bit of lemon. It was extremely good! No free zucca chips this time, much to our disappointment. We decided to change up the pastas and pizzas this time, opting for spaghetti and meatballs and a bacon and egg pizza. We requested the pasta first, with the pizza as a second course, but our server apparently mixed them up.    The spaghetti was, in short, not very good. We both were simultaneously taken back with how salty it was, making it extremely difficult to say anything positive about the dish. The pizza, on the other hand, had ingredients that were decent in quality, but they unfortunately botched the crust. There's a fine line between charring a pizza and burning a pizza. Char actually subtly enhances the flavor, while burning it basically overpowers the flavor. Unfortunately, this crust was full-blown burnt. No good!  This time, for dessert, since we gave up seeking the banana and nutella combination, we ordered a dark chocolate tart, that allegedly has nutella mousse. We couldn't detect the nutella, but I suppose it was good enough.  In the end, I'd give it three stars. There are clearly good and bad choices on the menu. Unfortunately, despite a trendy and lively atmosphere, it's not enough to bump it into regular rotation. Sadly, there are far better options for Italian food in Phoenix if you're willing to look past all the glitz in North Italia.",

They offer valet parking so make sure you have a couple of bucks to tip the valet guy.  I love North in the day - the restaurant is so open and bright. Our waitress was nice and we decided to place our order: short rib hash, a side of lemon donuts and bacon. They actually split the short rib hash for us since we told our waitress we were sharing.   The short rib hash and bacon was savory, and the lemon donut was the perfect amount of tart and sweet. Our order was perfect for the both of us and our bill came to a little over $20.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to come back to North Italia after a Yelp Event I attended last year. I finally got the chance last week. I could not have been more pleased with my experience.   First, I just love the look and feel of this place. Hidden behind a large group of trees is hidden this gorgeous, tall, modern, metal and wooden building. You first see their large wrap around Bar top. My favorite. You can sit either inside at the bar top of out side with the patio behind you. There is plenty of seating in the dinning area as well. The open concept has a welcoming feel. Even the kitchen is open for the public to come watch them create magic.   My husband and I sat at the bar top as we usually do. The service was crazy friendly, helpful, and giving. We ended up with a free appetizer, dessert, and coffee after all was said and done. They just want you to enjoy your time there, get stuffed, and try everything. To start we ordered CRISPY CALAMARI: ($12) Arugula & grilled lemon vinaigrette. Such complementary flavors. I highly recommend this to start with. Our server also got us the ZUCCA CHIPS ($7) when I asked him what it was. He just said \"Hold on, let me show you.\" These were very thinly sliced zucchini chips, lightly battered and fried. This would be perfect to start with if you are looking for something to not fill you up before our dinner. They were like tiny potato chips, and equally addicting. For our main entree's we shared both the SHORT RIB RADIATORI ($20) parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumb. So creamy and rich. The bread crumbs were the perfect touch to the dish because it was so rich. It helped soak up some of the rich cream. The Braised pork paired nicely with its sweet flavor. We also had the PROSCIUTTO PIZZA  ($14) mission fig, goat cheese and arugula. I mean... you cant go wrong with Fig's and goat cheese. For dessert we couldn't decided between the 2 so when we asked the server what he preferred he told us he would bring out the one he liked best. He brought us both. They were just too sweet to us. He asked me if I wanted a coffee, I said I would love a cappuccino that he also gave us. I wish I caught his name. Anyway... we had the SALTED CARAMEL BUDINO ($7) creme fraiche, maldon sea salt. Like a Salted Carmel Creme Brulee it was perfect. And Lastly the BOMBOLINI ($6) (italian donuts) meyer lemon curd,vanilla mascarpone. They were warm and melted in your mouth.   I really cant say one bad word about this place. I'm not sure if I can go back. I don't think anything will top our first experience here. But the food was so dang good... I'm going to have to come back.",

We started with the cauliflower appetizer.  It had an over easy egg, asparagus and some really delicious flavors. We all decided to try the daily pizza which was an Eggplant Pizza. It was very flavorful and I would have never thought that eggplant would be good on pizza but it was perfect.   For our main course we each orders a salad. The Italian Farm and the seasonal veggie salad. Holy moly! The flavors and veggies were so full of flavor. The salami in the Italian Farm had great flavor. I can honestly say that the salad was probably the best salad I have ever had. The dressing was a light vinaigrette and it was perfect!  For drinks we had the Strawberry Spice Mule, which is now my favorite drink, the Bellini and the Red Sangria. All the drinks were delicious and they were very generous with their alcohol. The service was excellent and overall this place is a must visit.   I'm from LA and had to see if there was one close to home and thankfully there is. Irvine here I come to get the cravings I will def need!  Thanks North Italia!!",

We split a margarita pizza and an appetizer which were both delicious.  The next time we came in it was Christmas Eve so the entire place was reserved until 8pm, except for the patio and the bar. We chose to sit on the patio, which was thankfully well heated and had a beautiful fire going in a large outdoor fire place.   We both tried different pastas this time, I got the strozzapreti and him the chicken parmesan. Both were incredible despite the chill air outside and the squalling baby at the next table. All their pastas are made fresh daily and their ingredients are clearly very fresh.   Since then we've tried a few other things, including the chicken pesto, the Bolognese, and the zucchini chips. All of which were just as incredible as the first time we came in.   The serving sizes are large and leave plenty to take home, their drink selection is vast and they have a full bar, the only thing we havent tried yet is their deserts (we just can't ever seem to leave room for it!). The location is large but gets packed quickly so make reservations, there's also a vallet so parking isn't difficult. Authentic and delicious Italian food in the heart of Arcadia, perfect for large groups, date night, or impressing your coworkers!",

I typically wouldn't leave a review but was very disappointed by our service when we visited on 9/21 for Happy Hour.   We arrived and waited about 10 minutes before our server came up and took our drinks orders. We ordered water and a Sangria pitcher. We watched the Sangria be ready at the bar and the waitress walked around for about 10 minutes, visiting the hostess stand, and in the meantime no one checked on us. Finally when the Sangria arrived our food had already been dropped off, we asked for waters again and they came a few minutes later.   Overall not the best experience, the food and drinks were good as always but the service let us down.",

    "text": "We went to North Italia for the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu and really enjoyed it. They had a chanterelle mushroom ragout for the day that's not part of their regular menu, but it was really good (mascarpone polenta is aazing). We also tasted the arancini, which are basically stuffed rice balls; these had mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese, really tasty.  For the main course, I ordered the burrata tortelloni which was really good, great combination of pasta, mushroom, and swiss chard. My Valentine had the red wine glazed short rib, so he got to try the amazing mascarpone polenta along with some veggies. The meat was tender and flavorful. (Short rib is on their regular menu, but it's prepared a little differently.) It was nice that the appetizers and meal portions weren't too huge so you didn't walk away feeling stuffed (as can happen in Italian restaurants). For dessert, I tried the tiramisu, which was really good but a bit heavy on the cocoa powder. I think I accidentally inhaled a bit!  I'd say the salted caramel budino is even better, even for chocolate addicts like me. The service was great and we felt like we had our own space even with the Valentine's Day rush; we were at a communal table along with another couple but we were on opposite ends of a large table. They also had some prosecco-based cocktails which were pretty tasty. Would love to try this place again on a normal night.",

The glitziest and most polished Italian restaurant that I've recently been to, which will require a follow up visit to see if it's all formulaic or if there is some spontaneity and originality to their menu.  Wish I could have parked my own car, they parked it fifteen feet away and didn't want to retrieve it at the end of my visit bc it was fifteen feet away and not sure the valet trusted himself. Fair enough.",

    "text": "Excellent food with competent waiter and attention to detail. Complimentary valet parking on site. We started with a bowl of zuca chips and arancini. The tomato sauce it rich tangy and a hint of fennel, so good we regret not getting a tomato pasta dish as an entree. My husband had a short rib and horseradish cream sauce pasta. The daily fresh housemade pasta is in a realm of its own. I could not decide between the short rib entree and the scallops with sweet corn (I've been disappointed with fishy tasting scallops at other restaurants) the waiter took  the time to describe in detail how the scallops are sourced etc. I went with the short ribs and the chef obliged to make a small taste of the scallop dish for me which made my day!! I would have ordered it in a whole entree. Fresh and no fishy taste or smell. The corn risotto is to die for. My short rib entree was a tad salty but good, exactly like the short ribs from the greenehouse restaurant in Scottsdale. We had the doughnuts with lemon curd for dessert and it was the perfect balance not too tart. We will come back!",

We got there near the end of happy hour and ordered a couple of the pizzas and cheese boards which ended up being a great value!

    "text": "Starters:  - Grilled artichoke: Not a favorite for the table, but a definite favorite of mine.  Very beefy and full of flavor - Grilled calamari: Wow.  Silky smooth with a hint of the grill and the white bean ragu, which I was skeptical of, blended perfectly - Steamed mussels:  If not for being in public, I would have picked up the bowl and drank the broth directly.  The mussels were good too. - Braised meatballs: Very nice red sauce.  Might have been a tad too tender and I might have missed it, but I like a little bit of pork in my meatballs.  Main (I only have what I tasted to go on, but the rest of my party looked very happy):  - At the suggestion of the server, I had the scallops.  I wish I hadn't.  Although the description looked wonderful, it felt like the mushroom risotto, scallops, and shallots didn't mix well.  The shallots blocked out the risotto, which blocked out the scallops and the scallops, while tender enough, had little flavor.  That being said, the risotto by itself was very good.  Desserts:  -Salted caramel budino: I'd drive the 25 miles back here just for the dessert.  Just amazing.  The creaminess of the creme freche topping with the salt and caramel was perfect.  Again, if I wasn't in public, I would have licked the small cup clean.    Very good wait staff and nicely timed for a large group.  Next time, I'll try the gluten free pasta instead of one of the meats and see how that goes.  Can't wait for more budino!",

    "text": "Sorry, Monica and Ursula but I don't think this was the best pick for the ISC dinner. The food was just ok and I wouldn't say it was particularly authentic Italian. I ordered the Fungi pizza and even though I was expecting exotic mushrooms and caramelized onions what is actually on the pizza is lightly sauteed button mushrooms and white onions. So, pretty much the same as you get at Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. And the smoked mozzarella had a very artificial taste to it, as if it was not actually smoked but had liquid smoke or some other chemical added to it to make it taste smoky.  Don't get me wrong, I still ate half the pizza that night and took the other half home. It wasn't terrible, just not as good as I was hoping. I probably would have given North a solid three stars if it wasn't for the fact that I also ordered a glass of pinot noir for $20. It was a large pour, but that is still probably more than I have ever paid for a glass of wine in a restaurant, including very high end places. I looked it up online and Fox Restaurants partnered with a winery in Oregon to bottle this wine specifically for their restaurants. So I am really confused as to why it was priced so high? Its the most expensive on the list (I didn't know that when I ordered it). Since it was commissioned by Fox it is not available in regular retail channels so I can't compare prices, I just know it was not worth $20 a glass. Its flavor lacked complexity and the wine had very little body to it... it almost tasted watered down (**not accusing anybody of anything, just saying that's what it tasted like**). It was very disappointing.  I liked the casual and open atmosphere of the place and probably would be a fan if I had enjoyed the food and drink more. For me, North falls into the category of \"not worth the money\". Unfortunately, I don't think I will return.",

Either that or I'm busy stuffing my face!  NFI is a Sam Fox Restaurant so you know the ambience is awesome!  I've never felt out of place every time I go to any of his restaurants.  NFI is laid out like an old Italian kitchen.  Like mama's home cooked meal I say!  Lots of vintage lighting and an open patio.  I believe the garage doors open during the cooler months for a fresh breeze to run through the restaurant -- mmm nice!    I came to NFI several times and their HH is very good.  Wine and dine at the bar with some flatbreads cause it's my favorite.  I ordered \"The Pig\"  and it was a bunch of pork, but man you know; that's what I like!  No skimping the protein here!  Nice warm and cheese crust, while can add some crushed pepper to give it some kick!  Perfect with \"ma ber\"!  Their pasta is good too so don't for get to leave some room before you come.  I ordered their regular spaghetti and meatballs and lets just say it's my favorite in town!  The sauce taste like it's made from scratch while the meatballs, well meatballs to me are meatballs, but the sauce is what really makes a pasta dish.  In the end, I was delighted with my meals and the atmosphere was perfect to just relax and enjoy a few drinks before departing. - Enjoy",

    "text": "Interesting thing happened here. I'll start off by saying that I've wanted to try North for a while so shout out to Monica for making me get my butt in here. I also have to throw in that we both look absolutely smashing in purple.  So let's start with the good. North, like any Fox restaurant manages to pull off a fun, casual, lively atmosphere that is good for groups or a smaller crowd that likes to have fun. In keeping with the Italian Farmhouse motif, the inside has an open, almost converted barnyard feel with accents and decor that convey that farm fresh atmosphere.  You can count on a few modern twists to traditional Italian dishes from their appetizers and mains to their desserts. I appreciated having a choice of Peroni or Moretti. Their cocktail menu was interesting however the feedback from others was \"not impressed\" so I'm glad I stuck with a Moretti.  I started with a very respectable Caesar Salad. I am becoming more and more picky about my Caesars so theirs was as I said, respectable but not stellar. Our friendly server recommended the bolognese over the lasagna so I went with her confident recommendation.    Now this is my problem, not the restaurant's but I am one of those weirdos that likes capellini as my pasta of choice. I know, after nearly getting into an argument with a server at another restaurant (not a Fox restaurant), that a larger noodle renders more of the flavor of the sauce. This is why a bolognese is typically accompanied by linguini...fair enough. What I don't understand is this seemingly new trend where bolognese is now served with fettucini.   Long story short, this is how my bolognese was served and while it was good it didn't send me into endorphin-laden bliss like when I have some smooth-as-velvet capellini with my hearty bolognese. So it was good, not great and truth be told a bit of a let down. I know for the future to ask for capellini, so this is not the restaurant's fault.   What did blow me out of the water was their grilled asparagus. I am so glad I ordered this side. The asparagus was decent sized and grilled up perfectly. I knew I was going to regret it in the bathroom later on eating this much asparagus but it was so damned good. I can't believe I hated this stuff when I was a kid.  I took part of my dinner home to save room for dessert, which was vanilla gelato with expresso. Again, good but not stellar. But it's OK because we went to LGO for second dessert (like a good hobbit, I skipped elevensies)  So here is the interesting part. When I heated up my leftovers the next day for lunch, it was DELICIOUS!!!! Fettucini or no fettucini it was AWESOME. How often is your food better on the second day?  So to sum up, the best part of my meal was the company. North is definitely a fun place to go, but I would go more for the atmosphere less for the food and I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back here. But if I were invited for more food and fun, far be it for me to decline.",

If you're looking for something small to munch on, the zucca chips are good. The lemon donuts are also a delicious treat!   I haven't tried the pasta, but I have seen them make it fresh.   One of my favorite things about this place is the atmosphere. The decorations inside almost give it a modern, trendy barn feeling. It can get pretty loud inside when they're busy though.   They take reservations, which is nice, especially if you have a larger party dining there.   They also have a bike rack out front for those nearby who would like to bike there. It is right off the canal.   They have complimentary valet parking as space is limited. There is really nowhere that you can self-park. There is a large lot across the street for a strip of stores but signs state you can't park there if you are attending North. So just be aware of that. There are a couple spots for 15 minute parking for those who are picking up orders.",

Despite that, the service was slow and somewhat inattentive.  I've eaten at many Fox restaurants and this is the first one that really disappointed me from a service standpoint.  Once the food arrived, it was great.  But we waited much too long and wondered if we were invisible.  I'll give it another try, but with built in skepticism.",

Save room for the Italian donuts in cheese cream sauce. Extremely decadent!  Great place! I would go back and sit at the bar if I were by myself. The bar is nice and opens inside to the outside just like Hawaii!",

    "text": "I have gone to this North many many times before because I live close to the restaurant. For the most part, I am very happy and pleased with the service and the food. Unfortunately tonight was absolutely a mess. Not only were we seated at the table right in font of the entrance, but the pizzas that came out were not what my cousin and I ordered. So not only was I served a pizza that I couldn't eat, but when the pizza I ordered finally arrived, an hour and a half later, it was completely burnt. 1 or 2 pieces were edible but even those pieces were masked with a crunchy burnt taste. I was left eating the practically nonexistent toppings. My other disappointment was the waiter. While he was seemed friendly, I had a continuous feeling that we were at the very end of his attention span. The only time that we saw him was when he was bringing our food and taking it away. The only person who checked up on us the entire 2 and a half hours we were there was the manager when they informed us the first time that we would not be getting the pizzas we ordered because there was a mix up. I did appreciate when our waiter asked if I would like another pizza after I mentioned how burnt my second pizza was, but I was tired of waiting and just wanted to leave the restaurant. I think one of the biggest issues I had with the night is that I, in particular, spent 75% of the time with my food untouched and sitting in front of me, and not one of the waiters or managers took notice. If I was a waiter who saw that someone hasn't touched their food, I would ask immediately if something was wrong. Maybe if my waiter has done that, I would have been able to order something else and not have to leave the restaurant hungrier than when I arrived. I have loved North for years and I am always happy to go there for a special occasion, but this time was extremely disappointing. For how much they charge for their food and for the level of dining experience that they have shown to have, they really missed the mark tonight. Honestly, if it wasn't for the Olympics playing in the corner, I don't think I would've made it through the night.",

    "text": "NoRTH solidified and provided affirmation to my opinion of Fox Restaurant Concepts as a whole.  This one is on par with the product they produce, and I will say that they do their thing well.  You know to expect a cool place; well decorated, creatively put together, very trendy, hip design and atmosphere.  Casual enough that you can go in and relax, but edgy enough that the yuppies and trendy socialites will like to be seen.  The food is good, but never memorable \"I need to go bag and have that ___\" good.  The ingredients are fresh and the meals are well prepared and creatively crafted, however, that's what you should get, for the price.    NoRTH is no exception to any of these predispositions.  The staff is good looking in their plaid attire to convey the casual-ness, and we were promptly greeted (and thanked on the way out).  After about a 10 minute wait we were seated at one of the high top tables in the bar area, which gave a nice vantage point to see the neat array of material used in construction.  The place is well staffed, service was as it should be, and everything was completed in a timely manner.  So lets start with drinks, shall we?  The wine list is a bit confusing, because many of the varieties aren't common nomenclature.  Maybe I'm wine ignorant, but to me, it seems as if it would have been more helpful to give a description of each, or at least order them from lightest to fullest body...anything to give you a clue as to what was what.   Looking to appetizers next, more menu questions arise.  There are some items on the front page that should be ordered a la carte, I guess? to assemble an antipasti board of sorts, but then there are full blown apps on the inside of the first page.  A bit confusing as to what is what.  We simply wanted some bread to go with our Italian fare, and since it wasn't included, we ordered the baked olive oil bread from the front page.  It was good, but neither the two of us or our server were sure that we were going to receive what we were seeking.    The dinner menu has some creative and fresh takes mixed with old standards, as you would expect from the fox brand.  A few more questions on what was what, and we had our decisions.  I embarked on the chicken wrapped in prosciutto, and my lady half took on the shrimp pasta dish.  Both came out in a reasonable amount of time, and were presented very well.  The food was good, nicely put together, and creative enough that you felt you weren't eating somewhere else.  The pasta dish she had was very unique, in a red sauce that was minty at first, spicy, then finishing in a basil-y sweetness.  The verdict is still out but it was a cool dish, and my girlfriend enjoyed it.  The prosciutto wrapped chicken was very nicely crafted on a bed of sauteed spinach with some fingerling potatoes that were delicious.  The chicken was prepared properly, although I thought I would have been maybe a little more moist considering it was wrapped in ham and so salty...I was expecting a brine effect of moisture.  Either way, both meals were good, but then again, it seems like they should be at $17 each.  Neither will leave me with the overwhelming urge to go back anytime soon, but I wasn't dissatisfied either.    To make it a True date night we finished it off with the nutella cake and vanilla gelato thing.  It was very decadent, the nutella cake portion was flour-less so almost like a mouse, topped with the cold and creamy gelato and chocolate covered espresso beans.  There was a nice contrast between the flavors, textures, and even the temperatures of the warm cake and the cool gelato.  This would serve as the highlight in my opinion.  So all in all, NoRTH to me is like every other fox restaurant, it's cool, good, consistent, maybe a little overpriced for food that is slightly casual, but it's good enough that they get away with it, and you realize you are paying for the ambiance and experience too.  It's another one of those places I know I can get a good meal, but leaves you searching for more if you like those rare finds that provide you with culinary perfection at the same price, or the complete package for slightly more.    3-stars is completely appropriate.  It's good, good enough that we will probably end up there again, but not good enough that you can't wait for that time to come.  Nothing really blows you away in terms for food, service, quality, ambiance, or any other intrinsic for that matters, so I'm not sure it would deserve any more stars, it's a solid \"good\".",

We were there for lunch and we were about the 4th/5th table seated as we were there before 11:30.  There was nothing offensive, but the service was really slow and had a bit of an attitude. The zucca chips (one of my favorites at North Kierland) were over cooked. The $17 lunch portion of bucatini with meatballs was pretty small in size for the price. Nothing here was terrible, but out the door we were at $59.00 for 3 people for lunch with no drinks. Just saying you should go have a less than $20/person lunch at a much better place nearby like T. Cook's or Coup des Tartes.",

When we get there I let them know we have a reservation, they look for it and can't find it.  So the hostess says to me you must of called another restaurant very snotty...excuse me.  then why when I hit the button for directions it gave me directions to this place?  My husband gently grabs my arm he knows me all to well.  He asks if there is any available seating.  We are told on the heated patio.  Ok fine.  The hostess comes around to show us the way and she is wearing a dress that is just a tad longer than a shirt, IT BARELY COVERS THINGS.    The waiters are dressed in jeans and tshirts.  Normally I would not complain about stuff like this however when you look at the price of the steak and the menu the steak is $35 you expect some sort of aviance/atmosphere.  This place did not have it.  So we get to our seats and there are no tables in \"HEATED\" portion of the patio they plan to stick us as far away as possible from any heater....I refused to sit there and surprisingly enough there was another table closer to the heated area but honestly we are still exposed to the cold weather.  I had to eat with my winter coat on.  Food was OK nothing real special somewhat limited menu.  I asked for a hot vanilla Latte since we were so cold.  No Vanilla so I did without.  While I was there I had to use the restroom.  There are 5 restrooms that either man or lady can use each their own stall.  I go inside and I turn to close the door behind me and there is no handle to grab to pull the door shut. So I push it open and hope it would slam closed...nope.  I ended up grabbing the coat hook on the back of the door so I could completely close the door and lock. The parking lot is very small and its only complimentary valet.   Its also very hard to walk on if you have heels on like I did.  By the way our reservation was at 6pm We should of just turned around and walked out.  I won't go back.",

The third had the short ribs - loved the ribs, but didn't much care for the sides, which were bland and not very creative. The noise level was much too high inside the restaurant to allow for any kind of conversation. Everyone seemed to be shouting and then there was loud music, too.

Server was very nice though, not his fault management caused the culture.   The previous time I had went, I enjoyed it. But NYE it was so awful- I will not be returning unfortunately.",

From the moment we sat down, the female waitress was not friendly or welcoming. We had not even finished half our bottle of wine before she was rushing back with the check. It was like she was rushing us out of there, and especially for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend I would like to relax and enjoy it. She had other tables so it was not like she was trying to end her shift. We put on the reservation that it was my birthday and mentioned it and she did nothing for it. However, when we were leaving we saw a table next to us get a dessert with a candle while they sung happy birthday. Also, I had signed up for their rewards and told the waitress that I had the $10 off coupon and she looked at it and acknowledged it. Came back after running the card and didn't take any amount off the original bill. We were so unhappy with the service it wasn't even worth our time to stay and have her try to give us a credit for the $10. Sadly, I really would like to go back because it was very good and a cool place but not with service like that. Would definitely recommend making a reservation as it was busy also be prepared to tip the valet!",

We went with a group of friends for a birthday dinner and they told us they dont typically seat more than 8 at a table but they ended up accommodating 20 plus people on a Saturday night. The food was delicious. My husband and I ate pesto chicken pasta and the pig pizza. I was so full but wanted to eat more.   The only downside was that service seemed inconsistent. Some of us were still waiting on ordering drinks when some people had food arriving. It would have been nice if the waiters had divided and conquered in making sure the table was covered.   But .. that could have been due to them not usually taking big groups. So in total, give this place a big thumbs up",

When the bill came we ( 3 of us ) were charged for dinner prices ! I feel the waitress should have clarified we were getting the larger more expensive meal . Would I return , probably not ! I feel for $16.00 it was quite the rip off as meal does not come with any extra such as salad or bread. If you do chose this restaurant be sure to specify what portion you are ordering !",

    "text": "Somehow I didn't even know this place existed, and then my boyfriend's dad asked us to join him there one night for dinner and OH MY GOODNESS, we left feeling full and extremely happy.  First of all, the decor and look of this place is really cool. The ceilings are very high and the patio is relaxing, especially during these beautiful AZ nights in the spring.   To start, I had the Red Sangria. I don't know what it is with me and sangria but their sangria was super yummy! The rest of the table had different glasses of wine and no one complained. For the appetizers, we went with the Crisp Calamari and the Steamed Pei Mussels. The Calamari is more like half salad half calamari but nonetheless delicious! The arugula pairs so well with the calamari, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like arugula but he loved the way it tasted with the calamari. The mussels were perfect and the white wine butter garlic sauce is so good. TIP: If there's extra at the end, save the bowl and order a side of bread to dip in it, you won't regret it!! On another visit I got to try the Grilled Cauliflower. They top it with a fried egg which is great to break the yoke up all over the cauliflower. Creaminess mixed with the savoriness of the cauliflower is a flavor explosion.   For the entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered two dishes and split them both, I highly suggest sharing with a friend so you get to try multiple items!! We went with the Ricotta Gnocchi and Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. The flavors that came from both of these dishes...WOW, just wow. The Gnocchi might be the best gnocchi I've had in AZ. It's so creamy and delicious. I don't even like horseradish but it works to beautifully in this dish. The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and sat on a bed of great northern beans. Everything just paired perfectly with each other. Zach's dad ordered the Margherita Pizza and luckily I got to have a couple bites! Their dough and pasta is made fresh daily and you can really tell that it is, it's so fresh!! The pizza tasted refreshing, like they went out back hand picked the tomatoes and basil, and then made a pizza.   Lastly, the desserts. I don't even know where to begin. The Salted Caramel Budino and the Tiramisu. I would take one bit of one, and then have a bite of the other, then repeat. The flavor from each was so unique and vibrant that it did not overpower the flavor of the other dessert, making the one bite repeat possible and successful. The Salted Caramel Budino has me lost for words when it comes to flavor. The sweetness of the caramel paired with the salt is like unicorns prancing on rainbows on your tongue. The Tiramisu is also heavenly delicious. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose!  To sum it up for anyone who doesn't feel like reading the novel I just wrote, check out this restaurant and be prepared to spend some money if you want the full experience. The staff is super friendly and on point. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes!!",

The pizza was a little over cooked and had burned edges but was tasteful. A little a less sauce would have been perfect. The bolongnese was a first for me so I can't compare it to other places I've ate at. The sauce was hearty and a little too salty for likening, but was delicious. Their pastas are made fresh. The kitchen was opened and the sous chef and manager checked in on how we liked the food. The patrons there was a diverse crowd. The location is in a residential neighborhood, but behind a busy street. Be sure to bring tip money because their parking lot is complimentary valet. This restaurant was not busy during my visit however has a lot of potential. This place would do well if it was in a better location and seen from the Main Street, not behind a storage facility. It was our waitress's first day and she was so sweet and knew her dishes.",

I can go on. Can pretty much say anything you get, you won't be disappointed.",

Although a bit loud, overall I had a pleasant dining experience. Will most likely visit again.",

    "text": "First of all, get reservations because we tried to get in here for weeks. It was well worth the wait, but seriously, book ahead. One of my best restaurant experiences in Phoenix so far, for so many reasons.   Star 1 for not having to park my car! I am ALL ABOUT complimentary valet parking, it was so nice to drive up to the door and hand over my keys.  Star 2 for service. Our waitress was genuinely friendly and super knowledgable about the menu. She obviously had the wine menu memorized and knew which ones were organic (I don't really care about organic wine as long as it has alcoholic in it, but I'm still impressed) and where they were from. My family had never been to North before and she brought us some grilled bread to try too. Which brings us to:  Star 3 for food quality! They make their own pasta and bread in house. And everything tasted fresh and was plated beautifully.   Star 4 was for food taste. Because damn, it was all good.  Star 5 for atmosphere. My family is not the 'sit around and enjoy each other' kinda family. We go out, we eat, we leave. This is the kind of place you want to spend some time hanging out, enjoy your wine, and sit a while. The food wasn't brought out super quickly but that was actually okay because then we had some time between appetizers and entrees.   Well done, Fox Restaurants.",

The chef's board was ok, not a whole lot of cheese by any means.  Maybe because it was a happy hour deal?  It was seriously tantamount to one serving of cheese which is the size of 2 dice.  They tried to make up for it with the vegetables - asparagus, red pepper, some jam..    The daily pizza sounded good with goat cheese and arugula.  What we got was pretty, until you pick up a slice and all this oil drips down puddling into the plate.  It tasted fine, until you started on the other side where the sprinkling of salt on top turned into a heavy toss.  We did the best we can eating the salt lick, but made sure to ask for our next pizza without the extra salt on top.  If only we knew about their practice before!  I'd say the happy hour deals are pretty good and especially on Sunday where it's all day long it's worth checking out for yourself.  Save yourself - ask for no salt added to the pizzas!!  Even if you like a little, you can add it evenly yourself and not risk the kitchen messing up half of it!",

Now that i've been, I certainly will find the time to go back.    Tradition dictates, for a watered down italian like myself, to eat Italian cuisine on Sundays.  Lucky for me North has happy hour all day on Sunday as well as a brunch menu to select from.  With 1/2 price bottles of wine it's really a great day to come to North.  We went with the $20 board (meats/cheese/etc) and bottle of wine to start and also ordered some pasta.  Everything was great.  The service was fantastic, the restaurant is beatiful (in that open kitchen industrial sort of way), and the value was tremendous.  Fox restaurants are typically pretty good but this one may be my favorite.  That's in terms of food.  If i want to drink $2 Icehouse and play ping pong, I still prefer Culinary Dropout at the Yard.",

Despite being a growing chain this spot makes you feel like it's it own mom and pop restaurant. The Milano mule is one my fav drinks.  Had the bruschetta to start & followed up with The Pig Pizza as my main course. Pizza was good but need some more flavoring to the sauce and maybe some oregano to give it that pop. Only downside, the AC was pumpin so hard everyone was cold and I think it cooled off my pizza before I could get half way thru it. Would still return!",

The open kitchen really does have an Italian country feel, and the lighting gives the very large open room a warm feel. Nice large bar as well. Best of all is the number of walls that open up to the outside-perfect for this time of year. Our server had the perfect combination of personality and humor-not too much, just right. The menu has a great selection, no matter your appetite. The Burratta was nice and creamy, with a nice compliment of apple slices and Rocket. The potatoes with parmesan, rosemary and perfect lemony aioli were off the chain. I wanted an order to take home! Pizza crust is very tasty and perfect texture. Hanger steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The brunch menu looks super yummy-we definitely have a new hangout on the hood. Great job, Sam Fox!",

The ricotta gnocchi with short rib and horseradish crema to me was like eating a steak sandwich, rather than a pasta dish.  I just wasn't a fan of the flavors-well, the horseradish crema-which was the ONLY flavor in the dish. And as another reviewer pointed out, the pasta did have some oil (or butter?) visibly separating, which was a little unappetizing. My husband had the \"house specialty,\" the pasta bolognese, which also wasn't so good. Limp pasta and sausage-heavy bolognese. -No depth of flavor, one note.  Sorry, fresh, delicious pasta dishes shouldn't be that hard to achieve for an Italian restaurant.  Fox Concepts' Olive and Ivy is much better!!!  It's consistently great. I also happened to have a yummy pasta dish at Fox Concepts' Arrogant Butcher - it was a sweet potato pasta dish. When combined with some of my husband's steak, that was pretty delicious. Without the meat for some savoriness, it was a bit sweet.",

I got there about 20 minutes early, got a table and ordered a glass of wine. It was very busy, loud and a bit crazy on that night. I waited for friends who called me to say that when they attempted to valet park, they were told the lot was full. They weren't offered an alternative. They decided to park in the lot of the sopping center to the west and were told by the security guard there that parking was not for the patrons of the restaurant and their cars would be towed if they parked there. They told me they'd meet me at Chelsea's kitchen. I told my waitress and had to cash out on the glass of wine that I hadn't even had a chance to try. I was furious! I left, the manager came out as I waited 15 minutes to get my car and she asked why I was leaving. I explained. She said that they could have parked at the circle k or 7 eleven or whatever is across the street and I asked why the valet hadn't told my friends that. She said she didn't know - was sorry-and that was it. Didn't comp the drink I didn't drink, I felt obliged to tip both the waitress and valet modestly but overall arrived almost a half an hour after my friends at Chelsea's and it was a very bad experience all around! I won't be meeting anyone there again. Although it only happened once out of four times there, once was enough!",

We started  by sharing the fall vegetable salad, singlehandedly the most innovative salad I've had in a long time-faro, kale, romaine, dates and almonds in a beautifully light (and properly) dressed  white balsamic dressing.  Lord have mercy, that was GOOD! We then shared the ricotta gnocchi with beef short rib, arugula and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs did not go unnoticed by me.  They added a \"snap\" to the gnocchi that was fabulous-beautiful texture!  We also shared the raviolini which was stuffed with pork and roasted mushrooms, topped with fresh arugula in a preserved lemon sauce. Again, innovative and unbelievably delicious.  So unexpected, so delicious and all recommended by our knowledgable waiter, Connor.   And because we each took a very long bike ride today (and because we are pigs), we treated ourselves to one dessert each! The sticky toffee cake and the affogato.  Both were very good but super sweet and I would not have them again together-a bit too much. But that was our mistake. We simply couldn't stop. Once I got used to the salt on the sticky toffee cake which was a bit shocking on the buds (trust me, I know all about the salty sweet thing-I was a fan of it before you were born), I grew to adore it. We also got the affogato which we both agreed was a bit too sweet. I would have liked to bite into something a bit more substantial than just nutella-and trust me, I dig nutella. To sum up our experience-GO!",

I have to say I have driven by many times and thought, wow I love the look of this place, the huge windows are so inviting! So when this place was picked I was pretty excited!  I got there a little bit early which was ok; it allowed me to really take this place in.  I absolutely love the opened kitchen. The entire place has this opened feel to it, rustic yet modern at the same time.  Visually impressive.  Some of us meet up for Happy Hour, but quickly found out that happy hour ended at 6, so I rushed my order in at 8 mins till. I had a glass of the house white wine, it was very pleasant!    After everyone arrived it was time to order! I surveyed the menu over and over, but kept going back to the Pesto dish. I love Pesto! It's one of my favorite dishes, also something that isn't cooked often in my house, so I took this opportunity and ordered it. The pesto was fresh, the noodles perfectly cooked and fresh! Love homemade noodles! I was very pleased with my meal!  Everyone's dishes looked amazing too!  Glad to have tried North Fattoria Italiana and look forward to coming back!",

Tonight's dinner was absolutely delicious, as usual, from the garlic bread and meatballs - which are the most scrumptious and moist meatball I've ever eaten - to the chicken Parmesan I had for dinner which is super hearty and the best!! The setting in the restaurant is beautifully designed with comfortable seating and awesome staff! We even come here so often for brunch that we know most of the staff and have even created a special menu ordering option for one of their brunch sandwiches! The creme de la creme and our current  jewel of the FRC family!! Come here quick! Hand made pastas and delicious pizzas too!!",

    "text": "I wanted to start by saying that the Fox Restaurants Concepts are my absolute favorite spots in the valley. I have visited almost all of the restaurants that they have to offer here. North Italia on N 40th St in Phoenix has been my favorite by far. I first visited the restaurant back in March for my birthday knowing that it would be amazing just because of my past experiences at this company's restaurants (and not to mention Italian food is my favorite).   Let's get to the food, back in March I went with a few friends for my birthday like I mentioned and we wanted to order so many of the menu items so we shared a few appetizers such as the crispy calamari, the grilled artichoke, bruschetta and the white truffle garlic bread. Every single appetizer was spot on incredible, and I could not get enough of the truffle garlic bread, absolutely perfect! Of course since it was my birthday I had to get dessert, it was the best part, the salted caramel budino was phenomenal I'm craving it just thinking about it. We were there almost till closing and even though the day was almost over the staff was very friendly and joyful about celebrating my birthday. Not to mention the free valet parking? Just when I thought it couldn't get any better!  My second visit was everything I expected after my first one. My friends and I loved it so much we went back for my friend's birthday recently. This time I decided to try the margarita pizza and the zucca chips. First of all, the zucca chips are so good they're addicting, especially dipped in the sauce. We also tried a couple deserts that included the olive oil cake which really wasn't my thing because it didn't have much of a sweet flavor, but we also had tiramisu which is one of my personal favorite deserts which was also very tasty! I have to say that nothing beats the salted caramel budino is still my favorite of the three desserts I have tried. At North Italia you receive good sized portions with a good presentation and the prices are at a great/fair price point varying from lunch to dinner and what type of dish you order. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great because it is very modern and trendy but also has the classic Italian feel. I love being here to dine at night because the tables are lit by candlelight and the option of patio seating that has string lights. Even though it can be a restaurant that tends to be busier and louder on some nights the atmosphere and staff are still fabulous. I do recommend making a reservation if you're going on the weekend because this is a very popular spot for well known reasons!  I'm looking forward to my next visit to North Italia, and I can't wait to try something else that is equally delicious on the menu! If you haven't visited before, I recommend you go soon it's so worth it. Especially for their dessert (yeah I'm obsessed)!",

We ordered the \"board and bottle\", a $20 happy-hour deal for a delicious chef's board (enough food to fill at least one person for a meal) plus a pretty good bottle of wine.  The chef's board was so delicious. Toasted bread, garlic butter, cheese, prosciutto, nuts, asparagus (which I really enjoyed even though I don't normally like asparagus), and other sundries. I enjoyed every bite of it. And the (red) house wine was... pretty good. That's about as much as I can say about it.  We also ordered the calamari, which was some of the best calamari I've ever ordered from a restaurant.  Service was also very prompt.  All in all, 110% worth it.",

Smaller portions ...a bit pricey but standard for the high rent Arcadia District.  The mandatory use of the valet service was more of an irritation than a convienence. We parked our own car since I needed to make some calls. We then gave the valet our keys when we went in to dine. He returned the keys to all at our table a bit later when his  shift was over. Paid him for the service so he was a happy camper.  Had a party of six for a lunch meeting. Place was not crowded. We had two chef boards that were actually put together by our server. They had prosciutto, artisan cheese grilled asparagus, roasted pepper, olives. Don't recall seeing marcona  almonds. There were some grilled bread slices. One board had marinated eggplant the other did not. Server brought additional eggplant and said it was her first time making the boards. Woops on the quality control checks if this was her first time.  Could have used more bread on the board or a bread basket. Thought that was pretty standard in Itallian restaurants. Each board was $16....great taste but a bit below expectations.  A couple of folks had the Italian Grinder. Couple of folks had the Burrata Tortelloni and other pasta dishes with salad. I had the Burger which included a salad, grilled onion, roasted tomato jam arugula and aioli.  Burger was tasty, a bit messy to eat but all was good. Service was a bit off....they forgot a beverage order but that sometimes happens.  They have a huge brick oven and bet their pizza dishes are great. Lots of good reviews on Happy Hour. Several people at the table have been here more than once and one person said it was their favorite Itallian place in the hood.",

    "text": "One of my favorite Happy Hours! $20 for a bottle of wine and chefs board. The cheese was not very flavorful but the consistency was nice. Paper thin prosciutto, cut in front of you and amazing grilled bread. Usually bread is the only thing that's left on my boards...but this bread had a slight sour flavor, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. So believe me when I say that slate was wiped clean True Italian pasta with scratch made noodles and flavorful sauces. Top your meal off with a bold yet smooth espresso and vanilla ice cream palate refresher. Great atmosphere with wooden tables and a vaulted ceiling. High tops, patio and long tables for large parties. Open kitchen which is great for entertainment.",

The bruschetta was unique & the zucca chips absolutely addicting! For dinner I ordered the Short Rib Radiatori-the short rib was seriously melt in your mouth & the pasta was delicious! My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan & it's his favorite chicken parm to date (the competition is intense). The noodles that came with his had a bit of truffle oil that was the perfect touch! Not at all overpowering! Our server was Robert & he was fantastic! So fun, personable & helpful! We really enjoyed interacting with him! Great restaurant, super close...we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "So let me preface with saying that I had been to North before I had moved to Phoenix and one of the selling factors of my apartment is that is literally across the street from this beautiful, wonderful establishment. First off, it literally fits every occasion. If it's just a super casual dinner with a friend in town or maybe you are celebrating a birthday and you want to dress up a little bit, it's perfect for it all.   The top things I love include but are not limited to: half price bottle of wines all day on Sundays, if you are a vegetarian (like me), you can generally get items on the menu without meat, white truffle garlic bread (YOU NEED TO GET THIS), funghi pizza, bolognese (pre-veggie days but it's so flavorful yet light), the salmon, the mushroom tortelloni, and the chicken pesto. Side note, for the longest time I didn't really know they had brunch but everyone should know they have brunch because it really is a solid menu and it's such an awesome atmosphere to experience on a weekend morning.   Everyone is always so nice, the outdoor patio is a nice area, even sitting at the bar is enjoyable. All around just a great vibe, you never feel out of place. The food is delicious (perk, they make their pasta in house daily) and not to mention the staff is always so accommodating. I was there 2 weekends ago with my parents and best friend and we were just right around an air vent so it was really cold and they turned off the vent for us. How wonderful is that??  Whenever I have a guest in town, this is always my go to place for dinner because how could you go wrong?",

Order the dessert.. you won't regret it.. it was my first time .. I had the bambolini .. four Italian donuts served over Meyer lemon curd and mascarpone.. omg so light and those flavors mix and pop in your mouth.. perfect ending to a great meal.

This place is beautiful, the decor in amazing and the kitchen looks impeccable, however I didn't feel like I want to come back as a place I would like to hang out.  We went with another couple, who suggested the place.  The food is not bad, however it is not memorable.  As a native Italian, I know pasta and pizzas. I stated with the Heirloom Beets salad, that was delicious.  I think my favorite item of the night. For my entree, I had the Tortelloni, they were good, however I think they are overworking the pasta.  There were spots that were really tough at the seams of the pasta.  By the way, the portion for this dish is really small, which for me it ok since I am always watching what I eat.  The filling, made with mascarpone was great.  I was noticing while we were eating at one of the high top tables that one of the kitchen members was beating the heck out of the pasta.  I have to say, though I was coveting their pasta machine.  The wonders of automation, I have to crank my pasta maker.  I think I should get me one of those, before my mom's next visit.  My hubby had the House-made sausage pizza. Again, the dough was so overworked that the pizza was too chewy and not in a good way.  My friend had the Gigli, a pasta with pesto sauce, very nice.  Her husband had The Pig pizza.  He left all the crust since it was too chewy.  The dessert they push is the Salted Caramel Budino, it is good, but as a sweet tooth person, I didn't finish it and that is a lot to say.  Not much dimension or texture, just pudding like textures all the way.  On the other hand, my hubby's dessert, the Affogato was delicious.",

Last night my boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and on a whim decided to give it a try. We will definitely be back! I do love the open concept of the restaurant. It is quite spacious inside, which was nice, since it allowed us to be seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30, yet it still felt cozy enough to be romantic. The wait staff was very prompt and friendly and very helpful when it came to recommending food. I love the fact that they make their own pasta and sausage, by the way, and had to try both - one in the form of the pork belly gnocci, the other as their sausage pizza. Both were so delicious, that we finished every last morsel on our plates. We even decided to give the desserts a try and had the salted caramel something or the other, which was a wonderful combination of flavors.  The one minus, and it is a small one, is that both my boyfriend and I smelled like food, as you are literally sitting in the kitchen. But it is a price I am very willing to pay again and again!",

Both were equally friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and were very attentive to our table. We were seated on the protected patio outdoors--but I enjoyed the decor and lighting inside, as well. Sort of \"urban farmhouse\". Two of us at the table order the chopped kale salad and the other had a pizza with a variety of meats on top. For drinks we just had ice tea which was fine. The chopped kale salad absolutely hit the spot. It was mixed in with little bits of diced pancetta, egg, tomato, and gorgonzola. The dressing was light and bright and really enhanced the flavor of the kale. The salad was very filling. I  had a hard time choosing after looking at the other tables around us, as everything looked and smelled delicious and was brightly prepared and presented. I'm pleased to learn that we have a North restaurant as well in Colorado and hope to visit there soon to try some of the pizza and other salads!",

After telling the waitstaff I was lactose intolerant and asking for my dish without cheese, it still came with Parmesan on top. 3. The parking lot is tiny and valet is mandatory, but they are always understaffed so it takes an inordinate amount of time to drop off and retrieve your car. 4. I asked for another dish's cream sauce to be subbed out for a tomato-based sauce and it took 30ish minutes for my party to get its food. I never want to come back.",

    "text": "I don't really like Italian food.... there, I said it, it's True. You can begin submitting your hate mail. When anyone asks the question, \"What do you want to eat?\" Italian will rarely, if ever, come out of my mouth. However, that may have been changed by North Frattoria Italiana.   Many of my Phoenix Yelp friends have been to and speak highly of North. I just realized that I can literally walk there from my home. At times, I'm completely oblivious to my surroundings. All this time, North has been sitting here, and I haven't taken advantage of it. Well, today that has all changed.  We came here tonight because my offspring loves Italian food... He may not actually be mine. I'm kidding, he's mine, bought and paid for.    The first thing I noticed about North was the setting. Unlike the typical Mamma Mia... Ay you's guys... Ooh La La (actually I think that last one's French) atmosphere, North has a farm house feel. The staff was even wearing plaid shirts and jeans. I liked that laid back feel. I'm a country boy at heart so the farm-esque tone was comforting.  We started our food journey with the calamari and a seasonal chef board: The calamari was okay. The breading was a bit heavy and I thought it took away from the flavor and feel of the calamari. It's not something I would get again.  The seasonal chef board was good. It consisted of brussel sprouts, squash, asparagus, mushrooms, some kind of cheese and a few slices of really good bread. I liked it, but it was more for my lady. The veggies fixation is her thing.  For my main dinner I got the Ricotta Gnocchi. It's braised beef short rib with gnocchi served in a horseradish crema and wilted arugula. I love short rib, but I'm not a huge fan of horseradish. I asked our server her opinion and she assured me it all complimented each other. She was absolutely right. It was excellent. The short rib was very tender and the crema, meat and gnocchi all worked perfectly. Excellent.  I could have ended the meal there and been content, but we didn't. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu and Bombolini:   The tiramisu is served in a glass container rather than in sliced cake form, and is covered in playful little chocolate balls. I liked the presentation. It was cool looking and tasted great.   The bombolini are Italian donuts. They had cinnamon and sugar on the surface and were plated on a lemon/vanilla mascarpone pudding-like bed. It all worked well together and my son, who is a bit of a \"donut expert\", thought they were very good.   Overall, this was a wonderful experience. Everyone walked away happy and I found an Italian place that I could see myself frequenting... for that, 5 stars is in order.",

I've been a somewhat regular patron of NoRTH Kierland and I'm also a fan of the NoRTH locations in Tucson and Denver, so I was really excited to find learn that the sixth location was being built just minutes from my house in Arcadia!  FRC did an amazing job transitioning this old car wash space into a gorgeous looking modern Italian Farmhouse.  It's spacious and and comfortable.  While I've only been for lunch, I will definitely return for dinner, and I hear they may be serving breakfast at this location too which I'd be down to try also.  While I'm not a fan of being forced to valet, at least it's free (although you've gotta factor in a tip). All of the staff from the valet to the hostess and waiters were exceptionally friendly, and as mentioned in other reviews, their \"uniforms\" are extremely cool.    But even more important is the food... and this menu is different than the others (although they do have some of my favorite old standbys like zucca chips and the insalate casa aka Caesar salad).  Some new favorites from my recent lunch are the salumeria panini (soppressata, salami, mortadella, roasted peppers, provolone) and the verdure pizze (brussel sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onion, spiced hazelnuts, ricotta salata).  And if you're looking for a little snack or starter, I'm a huge fan of the crispy chickpeas.    Since this new location is conveniently located super close to my home, I can't wait to return to try some of their other menu items and some wine, beer, or cocktails from their very well stocked bar.  Happy hour, anyone?",

It was a Friday night and myself and boyfriend walked in, assuming there would be a wait- no worries! The hostess told us it would be 40 minutes. I said, great and we found ourselves enjoying a drink at the bar. 1 hour later we checked in with the host and they said there was only one person ahead of us. No worries, we will wait a few more minutes. 15 minutes went by, and then close to 25 minutes rolled around. We had waited for nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes. We were disappointed to say the least. We checked in one more time and they still had no table for us. We reluctantly just sat at the bar instead of waiting (who knows how much longer) for a table, which we preferred. Normally, I don't have an issue with waiting for a table, but during our long wait time, there were at least 3 tables of 2 available for at least 45 minutes. Because we have been here many times before and know that the food is delicious, we stayed and ate. However, if I was a new customer I would have left and found food elsewhere. I hope this review gets seen by management, as this experience did not sit well with me and I have experienced much better in my many visits before.",

We sat at the outside bar which was perfect for a quick stop. The Strawberry Moscow Mule was delicious and super refreshing!! Our server was nice and attentive. It may sound weird, but the bathrooms were great!... Private, roomy, and clean. The modern farmhouse atmosphere of North was so charming. The next time I'm in town (from Denver) I'll return for lunch or dinner. Our friends who live in Paradise Valley said the food is outstanding. I highly recommend a stop at North!!!",

I had the calamari to start, which was okay. For dinner, I had the very delicious steak and potatoes. My boyfriend had the pasta (I have forgotten which one) and he loved it.",

It's incredibly clean and the staff is always great, friendly, and reliable. The general manager Jamie is a total sweetheart and keeps his ship tight. The bar has indoor/outdoor seating, perfect for the awesome weather we've been blessed with! Today, I had the Seasonal Vegetable salad, exquisitely dressed might I add, with cauliflower, romaine, kale, arugula, golden raisins, dates, farro, marcona almonds, avocado, and it was delightful! I also tried the Arancini, 3 deep fried mushroom risotto balls. Comforting, but not overwhelming. The vegetarian options are really good here, not much in the way of vegan selections, not surprising for an Italian cuisine. Spend the evening here with friends, the wine glasses are waiting for you!",

Nothing is overly heavy or too much. Their pizzas are wonderful, and my favorite entree is the salmon with the white bean ragu. It's just filling enough and gives you the feeling of pasta without the heaviness if you're not hungry enough for one of the pasta dishes! Their cocktails are fabulous too. The ambience is warm and cozy and it's perfect for a date! The only downside is the parking, but a tip is to drive down to Elm Street and park in the neighborhood. It's a close walk!",

A basic dish and yet still so fantastically good!  So, yes, all home-made pastas of course, fabulous environment, just a wonderful place. Oh the spicy shrimp spaghetti is amazing too. Sam Fox gets ALL my money!",

    "text": "I went there Sunday for brunch by myself, sat at the bar. Was promtly greeted and given a menu, no smile however. I had a few questions about the coctails which were answered and I debated between two drinks I got the one I didn't order. However I didn't mind because it was fantastic.   I had the fritata which was nice but small, I enjoyed the swiss chard and fingerling potatoe combo and the smoked mozz over the fritata was nice. I also got a side of polenta. Which was not your typical polenta, it was delicious don't get me wrong but it had no texture, it might as well been cream of wheat. It was very creamy and smooth and I was just expecting a more textured dish when it comes to polenta.   I will say I did like the big open space and farm like appeal, however I did not like the dirt patio.  I would like to go back to try some other dishes, some of the pizza's looked more interesting than others and the salads I would like to try.  Over all I would give it 3.5 stars and would come back, at least for a drink if not to eat again.",

Things I especially enjoy are their zucca chips, smashed tomato pizza (a chef's special that night), the spicy pasta with shrimp, and the happy hour - Oh the happy hour!  It is great, and goes all day long on Sunday.  Tremendous value and easily can get out for under $40 for a complete meal for 2 including wine if you take advantage of the specials.  I have also enjoyed several brunches here - they have a great patio with a fireplace for cold nights.",

A few of my friends and I decided it was amazing patio weather so we decided to sit outside at North. While the dirt floor outside patio is a nice idea it is messy. It has your shoes covered in dirt, not good for OCD girls with open toed expensive shoes.  We got the chef board as an app which had 2 cheeses, bread, thin sliced salami, peppers and some spiced nuts.  The salami was sliced super thin which was nice for a change and had a spicy kick.  I would definitely get it again.  We also asked our waitress (who was super nice) if they had a specials.  She recommended a sauvignon blanc wine which we decided to try, not knowing that it was $52 a bottle til we got the surprise on our receipt.  Our mistake, but I could hardly call that a special.  Best part was overhearing the guy get his burnt pizza delivered next to us a slice missing.  The waiter had been bumped, a slice fell down he brought that pizza missing slice and all to the customer saying that a new one was on its way.",

I can tell when the taste is beyond good, I've been in great restaurants before...I've even been in Italy, I can tell... This good was so good I pretty much ordered everything on the menu, ate most of it and made me wish I've had a bigger sized stomach.  Seriously, this good is so well done you would not be able to stop eating it.  This was my first time in Arizona and I must say, next time here, I'll be here eating the same amazing food I had.  Meatballs were amazing, so was the Margarita pizza.  I had also artichokes and there was also the truffle chicken pasta,..overall, one of the best places I've been.  Highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Sam Fox, you always seem to have a beeline directly to my  wannabe foodie heart.  I came to the New North as I call it just four days after it opened. Usually you think brand new restaurant they are probably still ironing out the kinks right? You must not know Sam Fox like I know him. This man has a knack for turning mediocrity into excellence. I mean the space used to be a car wash! A CAR WASH! Only Fox vision could turn a car wash into  an amazing addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene.   The restaurant is officially called North Fattoria Italiana, which I will tell you was confusing at first. When your friend calls you and says \"Want to go to North, it's the new Sam Fox restaurant?\" \"You mean the one at Kierland? That's not new.\" \"No not that one a new one.\" HUH??  I decided to stop asking questions and just go. Our waitress informed us that Mr. Fox is probably going to take all of his North locations in this more casual direction.   I started my experience with the Julietta cocktail. Super awesome and girly, I love any cocktail with bubbles. Plus the cocktail looks like an accessory to your already cute outfit.   The menu is a neighborhood Italian vibe. Pizza, pasta, antipasti. Of course, there is the Sam Fox flair. I shared the margherita pizza, which was very good and the ricotta gnocchi. Both were stellar. The gnocchi is not a traditional potato gnocchi, but it was very good.   Of course I finished off my meal with dessert. Since, nutella to me is as good as gold I ordered the \"affogato\", and it was a great end to an overall great meal and experience.   A plus was that our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. Always nice to have good service when you are spending your hard earned cash. I can't wait to go back and give New North another spin.  Touche Sam Fox, touche.",

We had eaten at the North restaurant in Kierland a number of times; however, we live in downtown Phoenix thus it was a perfect occasion to try the Arcadia restaurant. We arrived at the restaurant at approximately 9:15.  You have to park with  valet at this location, we ended up waiting for a few minutes for them to arrive -at that moment I thought we should leave, if only I had listened to myself. We were seated, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, a cauliflower appetizer, and goat cheese bruschetta.  The wine was mediocre, the cauliflower appefizer an abomination. It was a ten dollar appetizer that appeared as though it had been already served and partially eaten. The flavor was a 2.5 out of 5; the plating of it was dreadful After 25 minutes had lapsed my husband and I became concerned that the bruschetta had not arrived.  A few minutes later ( I believe a manager) delivered the bruschetta. She said \"this took far longer than it should have so we will take care of this\". Impressed I ordered another glass of wine. We then proceeded to bite into the brushettta.  The red peppers on top were right our of the refrigerator, icy cold. My husband chatted with our waiter, and he spoke to the manager. They opted to comp the cauliflower app and the glass of wine ( we cancelled the second one). My husband and I have both worked in restaurants in our lives and understand having a poor evening. We also have visited a number of the Fox restaurants and love them.  Due to our experience tonight we will not be visiting another North restaurant as there are many more options, the experience tonight ruined our evening and life is too short for bad food.  Initially I gave a one star review; however,..... I wanted to be careful to be fair thus changed it to 2.",

The waitress was super friendly and I believe the manager dropped by to say hi too. All parties on the table were here for the first time. The food was great and I was looking forward to write a 5 star review. I even took photos of all the food waiting to upload on yelp as soon as i get home.....until I realized the things they did when the check was paid.   We ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 4 desserts and total of 4 drinks. We all tips generously. However, as soon as the bills were paid, the waitress started by cleaning up the plates (understandable). Next stop was to clean up whatever else she could find (napkins etc). Last stop was to take away our water glasses so that we were sitting on an empty table. We didn't expect refill or bother her at all after the bills...but must they do that to kick us out? We were there to celebrate a birthday and wants to spend a little more time together before we all see each other again. Is that too much to ask?   Food: food was great but I am in no mood talking about their food right after the service we got.   Rating: I still give it 2 stars for the food....I am not sure if I want to come back and experience it again. My warning to yelpers: if u don't want them to clean the table and kick u out, don't pay until you are ready to walk out. So disappointed.",

I'm not the one who ordered them, so it wasn't my place to send them back or complain, and didn't want to cause a scene in front of my husband and his business associates, but oh my. It was bad. I spit it out and wiped my tongue with a napkin.   My husband ordered scallops. 3 scallops with a swoosh of cauliflower puree, $25??? And they were undercooked!  My spaghetti and meatballs? Well, I think the meatballs were premade, frozen, then microwaved to reheat. They were hard and rubbery. I could not cut them with the fork.  The server was nice.

Tell me when was the last time you scored a premium-ingredient Chef's board of meats and cheeses, and a not only palatable but darned good btl of wine, all for....ready......$20? Service was spot-on.  Only quirk was the valet parking service.  I think that my car must have been 1/4 mile away, it was very hot, and a sweat-pool graced my drivers seat. Uh....  But back to my \"dining experience\". North, even if it was only seasonal, you rocked it with this promo.  Great intro to your place, I will be back :)",

I had dined at the restaurant before and it was my Mom's birthday and she had heard good things so she decided to come here, though she had never tried it before.   This is one of the many reasons that I love Fox restaurants... If anything is ever not right, they will fix it... Always so hospitable. Even though there was just a slight misunderstanding, management was so apologetic and compensating.   Food was amazing & we will definitely be returning and will highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "You know when you have that long-time crush that you finally get to go on a date with, and while you're there you're all giddy and smiling, but once you get home you realize that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be?  That's my experience with North.  I went to meet a friend for their happy hour, and it was an absolutely gorgeous day so we sat at the bar outside.  The patio is very inviting, comfortable so it was nice to enjoy our meal out there.  The thing is, that is honestly the best part about North; the atmosphere.  Overall it's hip, casual, and seemingly a great date place, but the heart of the matter (the food) is solidly mediocre.  We got the cheese and meat board, which was enjoyable but nothing extraordinary, and I took a salad and pizza to go.  Now, while I was there swilling my glass of wine, I was thinking about how much I was enjoying North and how I couldn't believe I hadn't been there earlier.  However when I got home with my food I realized that I had been under the \"everyone thinks that guy is hot\" aphrodisiac, because my salad and pizza were pretty disappointing.  The salad was TINY!!!  And I mean smaller-than a-side-salad tiny.  For $11 I expect to at least be half full after that.  And the pizza was okay, not great so it was an 0 for 2 on the take home scale.  I truly did enjoy the dining atmosphere at North, so I would go back to try the happy hour again, but if I'm looking for an all-encompassing food, wine and ambiance experience, then I will definitely go elsewhere.",

    "text": "2nd time here. It has a cool Cali feel. I like the fountains in front. This time got the board it was good. The only problem we had was the waiters brought us the the wrong things 3 times. I used to work for a restaurant, it's not too difficult to know table #s & the difference between a 4 vs 2 top table. So, I am not sure whose fault that was. It became annoying to be interrupted. It seems the staff needs basic training. Our waitress was polite. The 3rd waiter to bring us the wrong item ( black guy, short hair -only saying to describe) was quite snarky. He said, \"your waitress Jessica said YOU ordered the bread!\" We did not! Lol It seems he wanted to argue. So, he picked up the bread & gave it to the other table, then picked it up again & gave back to us? So, I pointed out in Texas you are not supposed to put down food/drink items off a table & put elsewhere. Once again, he starts to argue with me again. Dear, even if you think you are right, the customer is always right! He could have just said, sorry. I told him, this has happened 3 times! One word UGH. I think couple next to us complained, as a Manager came to their table. No one came to ours. Food is good. Staff could use training. I think next time I go, I will just say yes to all items they put on the table lol. Be sure & sign up for their email club as you get $10 off. I liked North Italia, but with Mesero, Earl's, etc. next door I wontube back for awhile. No Manager replied to last review.",

Caesar salad, on the other hand, was ATROCIOUS. it literally seemed as if they bought a $2.50 bag of lettuce from Frys, grabbed a handful, spread it across the plate and threw some caeser dressing on it. it not only looked gross, but for a prices like that, I expected more, or at least a better presentation.  overall, its a super cute place to go on a date. the lighting is soft, the atmosphere is great but what  you pay for food and service is a little too much for what you get. not a bad place though, i would still recommend it to friends. I would just warn them to stay away from their salads.",

The pork tenderloin is so delicious if they don't overcook it but the polenta, sweet potatoes and balsamic reduction was finger licking delicious. The boyfriend ate almost half my plate because his chicken parm wasn't anything special. When we go back the tenderloin is all he can think about.  Goat cheese/beet salad is very yummy as is the Caesar. delicious croutons that seem to be made In house. Small portions but the entrees are so filling.  Short ribs are also delicious... That polenta I tell you! But the desserts are heavily lacking.  Pretty bland even if it does mention Nutella (my krypotonite!) I'd rather hit up a corner store for a pint of B&J.  I do like that they offer a slightly larger our of wine for a few bucks more.   We have sat at the bar and dinner tables during busy AND slow times. Water never refilled. Poured our own bottle of wine after the first initial pour. One server even opened our bottle away from the table and just walked up casually with it which I thought was kind of strange but maybe that's just how they do things there. Service is not friendly or particularly helpful which could set this place apart but shucks. Just mediocre at best",

I don't mind it being real or authentic Italian as long as the flavors and portions are good. I rarely get an appetizer but for my birthday decided why not. Chose the bruschetta with crescenza cheese, prosciutto, truffle oil and asparagus. It was tasty but I guess I was expecting something similar to what one usually gets at Postinos with several varieties. It was tasty but it they served only one large bruschetta to share. Nothing wrong with that but just different than my expectations.   I found my dish, the spinach tortelloni, a little on the small side portion wise but otherwise very tasty. I tasted my parents dish (my dad got the spicy shrimp pasta dish, a generous portion and what one should expect at $18, mom ordered the burrata salad (which my dad had heard was also on the small side but with the added portion of salmon, a large piece) it was balanced out (however it was $20 for that, quite an expensive salad for what she received).   Wine as good (I ordered a Zinfandel) and the dessert I chose, Nutella trifle was on the house and also very good.   I'd like to come again and see if there are any changes to the menu and/or quality of food but it's reputation is definitely earned and I think it's a great place to grab some drinks and maybe a bite if you're trying to do happy hour.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on a Friday nigh (6:30ish).  We had a reservation but still waited, albeit only a short while.    Water was provided right away, and they brought a new cold carafe constantly.  While their water glasses were small, having a ready supply at the table was welcome.  The interior is very nice, including the restrooms.  The open kitchen was really great.  While it was loud (it was pretty full on a Friday night) I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't louder with the cramped seating and background music.  We were seated next to a lovely young couple and their well-behaved baby on one side and a large party of ten or so on the other, but it wasn't raucous.  The service was excellent.  Gracious, friendly hostess and wait staff who seemed to enjoy their jobs (exception for the busboy but that's later).  Staff was attractive, but not in short shorts like Zinburger or Modern Steak (once you go beyond tight jeans to booty shorts I think you become a little tacky).  We had the mussels for an appetizer, and they were surprisingly light.  No heavy wine or butter taste in the sauce, and the salumi was spicier than I expected.  Only a few didn't fully open, and the serving was large.  The bread served with it was best when soaked in the broth at the bottom of the bowl.  Entrees came out very soon after the appetizer, but I didn't really mind, other than the tiny table being packed full.  He ordered \"The Pig\" pizza, and I had a slice.  It was spicier than I expected (and he also had shaken black pepper on it so it really had a kick!), yet also not as oily as you'd think a pork-laden pizza would be.  All the ingredients tasted very fresh, and it was more of a lighter pizza in the vein of Federal (far away from a heavy Chicago or Sicilian style).  The dough was chewy, with air bubbles in the crust and a great texture.  (You can also dip your crust in your leftover mussel broth if you still have the bowl!)  I had the Chicken Parmesan, which was the juiciest chicken parm I've ever had.  The huge slab of chicken breast is breaded, slathered in a marinara sauce, and liberally covered in melted cheese.  The chicken was surrounded by a rigatoni (almost like smaller penne) which was cooked al dente with a great chew.  The rigatoni had the lightest cream-based sauce I've ever eaten.  It wasn't buttery, but tasted of very fresh and light cream and smooth cheese.  The menu describes the sauce as \"grano padano cream\" and it kicked the butt of almost all the alfredo sauces I've had.  (Floridino's heav, creamy, buttery alfredo sauce is more of a rich, decadent, \"cheat day\" meal and can't really be compared to this, not to mention it's $7 less even with chicken.). The only other place I've eaten at that has attempted the whole red sauced chicken with white sauced pasta was Claim Jumper, and this blew them away by far.  I really wanted to try the Salted Caramel dessert, much to my dining companion's eventual dismay.  He decreed it much too salty, even when the caramel sauce was pushed away from the pudding, so only the fresh whipped cream earned his approval.  Be warned that it's very (deliciously) salty!  Star off for: Mandatory valet!  Just for them to park my dinner companion's car ten feet away.  While I understand why they do it (cramped parking spaces, lots of luxury vehicles), it still irks me.  Fox really needs to just buy out one of the neighboring land plots (like the Uhaul place in front of North).  Minus half a star.  Also, a busboy shattered a glass on the floor right behind an older gentleman by carrying a full tray and swinging a highchair in the air.  He didn't apologize or anything, just walked away and reappeared minutes later with a dustpan.  They really should have been apologizing and offering to comp his meal or something to make up for that.  This happened as we were leaving, so maybe the manager made it right afterwards.  Minus another half star.  Overall, I was expecting a more glamorous and higher quality Sauce, but they exceeded my expectations.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to hit up North in Arcadia last night. Nice addition to the area, fits right in with all of the other great places in the neighborhood. Met some other couples for drinks and dinner. Like most people who grew up here, obv not a fan of mandatory valet but oh well. Walking in, you're definitely struck by the amazing decor and it's certainly the highlight of this location. Big, open spaces, beautiful Italian farmhouse converted to a restaurant. Really stunning.  Sat at the bar for a while, it was packed and service was not as prompt as I'd like which was kind of a running theme for the rest of the night. Not a huge fan of the plaid shirts worn by the servers. They didn't really stand out and were hard to distinguish from the patrons sometimes. Finally, when we were moved to our table we just carried our drinks and a bottle of wine over, which I always think is funny when patrons are walking around a restaurant bottle of wine in hand...  Service was ok not great. 4 of the 5 couples in our group had never been to North but we never were given a run down of the restaurant or what is good or any of the normal stuff most servers give you when they first greet you. Never once did our server fill our wine glasses, and they tried to take my wife's dinner plate away before she was finished, and they actually did take mine away without even asking and I wasn't finished.   Food was very good as you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. Had the Seasonal Vegetable Salad w/ chicken and it was great. Love the farro in it. Also had the prosciutto wrapped chicken, was a little disappointed in it. It was good, but I just expected something amazing I guess and it just seemed pretty standard. I didn't at all like the bed of spinach it was served on. It comes served in a large bowl and the bottom of the bowl was filled with the juice from the chicken and the spinach was just kind of wet and soggy. Seemed like a sloppy presentation.  Definitely would go back. I'm a huge sucker for beautiful spaces and this is one of my favorites in the valley. Everything else was just decent, but that isn't terrible so I'm happy for another good restaurant in the area.",

The food is classic, has just the right amount of seasoning and flavor and is priced just right.  The decor is unique and brings a neighborhood feel to the restaurant as does the wait staff.  I have been numerous times and have had nothing short of an amazing experience.  It's never over crowded and the service is always great.    This is a staple for me in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "This place is disappointing.  I like the open feeling of the place ... even sitting inside feels like I'm outside.  The service we had was adequate.  But the food just isn't all that good.   I had the frittata (braised greens, potatoes, smoked mozzarella, arugula, grilled bread).  It sounds so tasty though I was expecting everything to be in the frittata except the bread but the arugula was on the side dressed with too much oil.  No real flavor.  The frittata had been covered with cheese and presumably reheated since it was lukewarm.  It was dry and bland.  I didn't taste any potato at all. The bread was average at best and could have used some butter and herbs.  I've been here once before a couple years ago and at that time I felt it was average.  I doubt I will return since it's not very close to me.  I would still consider it a great place for a drink.  I also want to address a prior reviewer who said Bolognese was traditionally served with linguine.  That is incorrect.  In Italy it's served with tagliatelle (which is very similar to fettuccine .. one is supposedly wider than the other but most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference).  The restaurant is not in the wrong here.",

Really the only downside, and that's if you can even call it that, is that I have the hardest time limiting the menu down.

Well, gravity and her recently deceased husband, Sid, overly-motorboating them throughout the years.  Lucinda, with no place to call home save for a stolen shopping cart, is waved in from the alley by your server to flash her 42 longs at you. And for all of two bucks! Boy, was I ever wrong.  Actually, Cheap Cans, as the server informed, is whatever they feel like serving on any given day. Some days Red Stripe tall-boys, others, PBR. Last night it was tall boys.  Someone in our party ordered appys, but I have no idea what it was called. I was too busy ruminating on the whole cheap cans thing. It was ten bucks and it had olives, cheese, pickled peppers, salami, hot salami, crusty bread and hot peanuts.  Two tall boys in, I dispensed with any graciousness and just started grabbing at anything i could get my hands on before the others beat me to it.   I suppose this is one reviewer's way of saying it was damned tasty stuff, whatever it was.",

The food: go during happy hour and get the zucchini chips for $3, they're light and crispy the perfect small app. The margarita pizza is $8 during hh and was perfect for 1 person, and was really good! The red sangria is delicious (not for those who dislike sweet wine), and the tiramisu was amazing! My husband got the rosemary chicken, and he liked it but wasn't super impressed. Our friend got the pesto chicken pasta and that was probably the best pesto I've ever had- definitely recommend that! It was creamy and flavorful, not grainy like pesto usually is. The service is always great, and I love the valet parking. Overall I love this restaurant!",

Casual lunch date, formal dinner date, Sunday chillaxing vibe, informal work meeting, I'm just here for the sangria vibe, you name it. Parking is tight here, very limited, however tolerable via free valet service. You can tell this isn't olive garden pasta. Comes out fresh and you can taste the quality in the ingredients and the care that went into its prep. Sundays here are the best. All day you can take advantage of their board and wine deal for 20 bucks. This includes sangria pitchers too, not just wine.   Why I love North:  - awesome pizza  - the strozapretti is by far my favorite pasta dish in the valley - I cannot find a better red sangria - the interior decor just suits any occasion  - plenty of indoor and outdoor seating - high quality without breaking the bank",

Very cool modern environment that's not your traditional Italian restaurant that's more styled like a barn with nice wide open doors to bring in a good air flow on those nice nights. They also have valet parking that's complementary  Now the food is about as good as it can get. My wife got the fungi pizza which had that perfect crispy crunch when you bite into a fresh dough pizza with a nice amount of mushrooms throughout. Very good pizza and can easily be shared.   I got the mushroom tortellini. Now that was what I've been looking for! The creme sauce is to die for. I could easily just have that sauce and dip bread into it. So good! The tortellini was filled with a nice blend of cheese and mushrooms and they added brussel sprouts, pine nuts and sweet potato. Perfect dish! A little small but I always think quality over quantity is the best way to eat.  Overall I love the place and you need to check this place out",

    "text": "Came here with my handsome husband and friends before the Jo Koy comedy show. We had reservations made and when we arrived we were seated right away.  If you haven't been to this location, parking is pretty much mandatory. Don't worry it's complimentary, just be kind and leave the valet guys a couple bucks when you leave.  The vibe is SO different than the Kierland Commons location. This location is way more hip, way louder and the energy is much better. They have gender neutral bathrooms which is awesome too.  ******SERVERS*****MANAGEMENT****   If you know it's happy hour, tell your customers! Our server didn't tell us it was happy hour, it wasn't until we overheard him answer the couple next to us about the happy hour they were having. It was now 3 minutes after 6 and we asked him about getting a HH menu. He said he would still honor the prices but what he should have done was told us AND given us the HH menu the moment we sat down.   Anyway, we got the zucca chips that was on the HH menu and we also go the mussels not on the HH menu and both were spectacular. For dinner, my husband and I ordered and shared a Cesar salad, awesome dressing and the croutons were to die for.  For dinner, husband and I shared the Short Rib Radiatori.  Pasta with Parmesan cream, fresh horseradish, wilted arugula, herbed breadcrumbs. It was freaking out of this world.  If you're in the area, try North, you won't be disappointed and your taste buds will forever love you.",

    "text": "First off, there's free valet parking (yay!) so you don't have to worry about trying to park in the tiny lot! We came on a weeknight so it wasn't too full but I can imagine it being super useful on a busy weekend. The inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious and really nicely decorated! They definitely highlight the whole made from scratch aspect with their open kitchen and various kitchen gadgets on display.  We tried the chefs board, daily soup, daily pizza, and the Bolognese. It was also happy hour so we got a nice discount on a couple of the things we ordered! Everything was really tasty, though nothing stood out as being exceptionally good. The chefs board was really fun and I loved the variety, though I wish they offered more meats. The pizza was probably their weakest dish. The Bolognese was good but the noodles themselves could have been better, but I'd really like to try more of their pasta dishes as I'm a huge fan of  pasta.   The service was really fast and friendly, and our server even threw in some free zucchini chips! Overall we had a great time and I would definitely come back!",

The atmosphere and decor had a nice vibe and the staff is friendly. We went on a Sunday and found out that all bottles of wine were half off so we got the Riesling. I ordered the filet. It was very tender and juicy not to mention the assorted carrots were also amazing.   Overall I was pleased with my experience. I will be back!",

Soon after we were seated, we were greeted by the server who offered up complimentary zucchini chips as it was our first time. While super tasty, the chips were a bit on the salty side.  We ordered the calamari app to start, our first thoughts were that that marinara sauce was missing. However, we soon learned that the calamari didn't need it.. Rested atop lemon vinaigrette arugula, the calamari was very flavorful and tender and the breading was a lot more fresh than other places. Very delicious!  Since I had filled up a lot on the apps, I ordered a Caesar salad. Nothing crazy. My fiance ordered the bolognese pasta which I sampled..oddly reminded me of having Chef Boy Ardee or Spaghetti O's as a kid. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but it sure was scrumptious!  Service was superb! There was a lull in getting our food out to which our server addressed and apologized for. He offered us warm bread with vinegar and oil while we waited and also treated us to dessert free of charge after the meal - we totally appreciated this gesture and attention! I feel like a lot of places don't address that type of issue when it happens but it was definitely noticed and we were impressed.  Excited to come back! Keep up the great service :)",

I asked the waiter for a straw and he didn't bring one for over 10 minutes, this gave me plenty of time to just sit and look at my tea when I noticed that there was mold in it. Although, I had already taken a couple of sips, ugh. I pointed it out to another waiter (I didn't know where ours had gone as I hadn't seen him for a while) who was very nice and apologetic and took it away. Our waiter came over about 5 minutes later and was oddly defensive about it. \"I just want to make sure that YOU know it was nothing dangerous\". Um, okay?  Later, he acted like king of the world for being so kind as to remove the tea from the bill. Haughtily proclaiming \"Oh, by the way, don't you worry about paying for that tea, I took that off the bill for you!\" OH MY GOODNESS! Thank you kind sir for not making me pay for the nausea you gave me.",

I am in the F&B business and I know that feels like a lifetime. When he did notice us he wanted to make with the pleasantries, I wanted a drink. He took the order and went back to finish his conversation. He was just as lackadaisical when we were called for our table and needed to pay.  Now then, we were sat and the the rest of the meal was a delight. Chx parm, braised ribs, the Pig and bolognaise . Food was good as was the service and to be fair the Dirty Martin's were good. I just like to have a staff that is aware of their surroundings.",

My stepdaughter even said \"this is the best spaghetti I've ever had!\". For those of you who have picky kids, you know it's awesome when you hear those words!   My husband and I split the Italian salad and Margherita pizza and added sausage. I didn't care for the Italian salad at all and my husband definitely didn't like it. I didn't care for the type of salami they used and the dressing was way too sweet! When I saw vinaigrette, I was expecting something worth out sugar or very little of it and this wasn't the case at all. I will say the pizza was very good, though I wasn't found of the crust. Their sauce was not too sweet and the basil was fresh. The sausage was also delicious!   As an appetizer, we ordered the zucchini chips. While they were not evenly cooked, I thoroughly enjoyed the ones that weren't overdone. They were just a little crispy with the perfect amount of salt.

    "text": "HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:  Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming.   We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.  AMBIANCE/MOOD: We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.    We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip\".  MENU: Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.  The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw\">yelp.com/biz/olive-and-i...</a>  As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.  Here are links to the menus: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxrc.com%2Ffrcwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F04%2FNorth_40th_Menu_Happy_Hour.pdf&s=9003334cfddb88eea139184f734d66ad62e6b11770b60a7597e1b5b8acfb010a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-conte...</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxrc.com%2Ffrcwp%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F04%2FNorth_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf&s=9e0902af3029182e80087cab92713797222100f850605ff6a29367a927c75ab3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-conte...</a>  SERVICE: We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.  FOOD: We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.  We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.  Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge.   For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.  PRICES: Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.  Enjoy!",

It is expertly executed but it lacks an authenticity that you want in your local trattoria, an authenticity that really comes through in other local spots like Marcelinos, Veneto, Franco's or Pomo. That doesn't mean that you can't come to enjoy a good meal, a great looking setting, and a fun crowd.",

So I shop at the Fresh and Easy across the street from this place and literally can walk here from my condo...to say the least I kept telling myself I was going to go for like the last few years...but had failed to do so...and since I am part Italian...I felt it almost an obligated duty to check this place out...so tonight on a whim, me and a gf went to see what all the fuss was about.   And to say the least..Woohoo! This is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian food. From start to finish, the service, the atmosphere, the food...it all was amazing.   We started out with the bruschetta...now this is not your Postino's type bruschetta...this is a do it your self sampler Chef's board bruschetta, with the freshest ingredients I have ever seen. Fresh made bread. Literally I think they made it all from scratch. I think they have some mad scientist in the back, churning fresh butter and making cheese along with growing the vegetables...I am not even kidding...almost filled up on this.  I am not a fan of olive's but my date said they were the best she has ever had. So so good.   For our main course I got the Chicken Pesto, so good...pesto pesto pesto if you like pesto this is it. Literally so much pesto even the chicken is green, smothered with pine nuts and parm cheese...literally melts in your mouth. She got the Chicken Parm. Simply Amazing...cooked to perfection. An as far as portion size...this thing was HUGE! We kept eating off each others plates...so good.   We decided if we get married North will be the place we go every year for our anniversary.   We both were so full, neither one of us even had room to try the desert.  But next time Gelato or Tiramisu for sure.  I have heard good things about this place, and am really glad we went. I heard it was pricey, but really it is not. Like $70 out the door for the two of us, and that included a few drinks and a standard 20% gratuity.   If you have not been here I would highly suggest giving it a try. So good, well worth it. Everything was excellent. Well done Fox Restaurant Concepts. Well done.",

My girlfriend ordered the Bolognese pasta, which was quite good (and I'm not a huge pasta fan, so that always says something) and I ordered the fig & prosciutto pizza. I decided fig and pizza didn't quite go together for me, but overall the pizza was of pretty high quality. Not Bianco, Pomo or Cibo quality, so I would have liked it to be a smidge cheaper than what I would pay there. Service was average, but overall had a great atmosphere and some good quality Italian food.",

It was the first of its kind of Tucson and the place for college kids to go if they wanted to feel \"grown up\" and for the small group of young professionals who live in Tucson to hang out at night. Well, fast forward some years and Sam Fox has now opened up another NoRTH location in the Arcadia hood and I'm a huge fan!   I've been here a couple times now and I've been happy with every visit. I absolutely loved the anti-pasta boards which come with your choice of cheese, meat and accompanied by sourdough bread. It's a perfect meal for lunch if you feel like sharing that and a salad. There paninis are buttery deliciousness! Be prepared that these guys are not low-cal, but if you're in the mood for some delicious buttery bread sandwiched with creamy cheese and yummy meat, this is for you. My favorite is the salumi which is a combination of meat and cheese. As for the pizzas, again this is no low-cal option but they are soft and crunchy at the same time and come in a variety of flavors.   I love the decor of NoRTH. It feels like there should be an ocean or lake right outside the doors and I really enjoy the open environment of this converted car wash. The high ceilings and open doors make the restaurant open and airy. There's plenty of seating including bar seating along with dining seating. This would be a good spot to either go for some drinks and appetizers or a full meal.   Thanks for bringing a tasty addition to the Arcadia neighborhood!",

The atmosphere is nice here as well, very spacey and thanks to the abundance of windows very well lit. We got the pizza and salad special for $20 and that was more than enough for my wife and I. Then the kids split a \"kids\" sized pepperoni pizza, which again was more than enough.   I would certainly recommend this place for a nice pizza and even a salad.",

A lavish restaurant which expends decadence upon patrons looking to dine, drink, chat and simply decompress. The building looks like a traditional yet modern farm architecture that kinda hovers between past and future, fancy and country. A loving tribute to an ancient noble farmer somewhere from a Tuscany hillside, Italy.  For a late lunch there is great activity. Locals today really care about their personal appearance and image. Everyone looks especially proud. I sat at the bar in the open air and ordered a Peroni Lager, 5. a light crisp Italian beer with a gentle flavor. My water was brought to me in a clear 500ml \"Grolsch\" swing top bottle with a clean glass. Even using a lemon as a paper weight for my tab was remarkable.   For my lunch I enjoyed a serious salumeria panini. Italian cured dry salami with mortadella, an Italian sausage. Roasted peppers and melted provolone. And I must mention the garlic bread. On the side was a small bowl of what looked like a spring mix pesto salad. 10.  This neighborly place with its kitchen sure was central to my heart and mind this afternoon.

It was delicious and had parmesian cheese sprinkled in it - weird at first but adds a great salty bit!  We had some baked French toast with vanilla syrup, homemade whipped cream and fresh berries. We also had a great parfait with Greek yogurt sweetened with honey and vanilla, crunchy granola and fresh berries.  On came the heavier courses of a veggie scramble and a short rib hash. The veggie scramble was my least favorite but that's only because I'm not a huge veggie in my eggs kinda girl. The hash though- wow. Everyone's favorite. If you've ever had their gnocchi then you've had their braised short rib and it's amazing.   Finish today off with a chat with the chef and a tutorial on how to make a tortoloni (yup not a tortiloni and I'm sure my spelling is off for both) then you can say I started my day in a pretty bad ass manner.",

Rolled into town last night and we were excited for a nice dinner. Got on open table and they showed a 7:45 reservation was available. I tried to book it and then got a weird message that they were having 'technical issues' and could not complete my reservation. So.. I call the restaurant and the lady tells me the reason I am getting the technical issues messages is because they are booked .. I was like 'well they show a table is free at 7:45' and she says 'sorry we are booked but the wait for walk ins is 30 minutes'. It was 7 at the time. hmm ok...well I thought maybe as a good faith gesture she would let us put our name on the list and we could walk over and then we could wait.  Seems like s reasonable request right? She was like, 'sorry we don't take call ins'  OK I get it. Tough luck.   Flash forward 24 hours.. Still craving some meatballs and good pizza. I call and place a takeout order. I showed up a little early. My order is not ready so I get a drink at the bar. I ordered a bulleit rye on the rocks while I wait. I watched the bartender pour and was thinking  damn that is a generous drink. I got home and checked my receipt. They had zeroed out my original drink order and replaced it with a double for $20. I did not order a double and never order a double. Maybe an honest mistake but I feel they were banking that I would not check my receipt and felt free to over charge me. I gave her a big tip thinking she was just nice.  Uber sleazy.    My takeaway - despite all the blather about this being a neighborhood place it is a part of a big chain that does not give a sh*t. Good food though!",

Service was top notch, appetizers were great, the diner was amazing, and then we topped it all off with desert even though there wasn't any room left. The only negative thing I can think of is that I'm only in Tempe for a week. We will be stopping back again before we leave. This place really is that good.",

For entrees ordered a few more pizzas which were all very delicious!  When I casually mentioned to our waiter Sean that it was teacher appreciation week, he said dessert was on him, and we choose three wonderful desserts.  After that the manager (forgot his name) came over  to thank us(as teachers) for what we do ,we def. needed that after a hard week at work!  A big thank to Sean and the staff at NorTH for a wonderful evening!    We never have a bad meal at a Fox Restaurant and this was no exception.",

The food is good, but the service isn't up to par.  We ordered the charcuterie and the cutting board had a fat crack in it, and the jam from the dish dripped through the crack all over my pants, which is not a huge deal.  BUT, they didn't handle it that well - no sense of urgency, nothing comped, etc.  I don't usually expect a comp, but the table adjacent to us was getting all kinds of comps because of their meal being delayed!  Very weak if you ask me.",

I finally decided to try it with a friend and I have to say it's a wonderful addition to current Arcadia offerings.  I stopped by ahead of time to grab a menu to peruse and I was immediately excited because I saw that if my first visit was good, I'd have to do about 10 more to sample everything that caught my eye.  When I see \"Italian\" I brace myself for more of the same old pastas and sauces, but this menu has a lot of variety, and it includes seasonal offerings (which as a nutritionist is important to me).  I tried a farro-kale salad and would order it again (on trip 11, after trying everything else!)  My friend and I sat on the patio which, despite the cold night, was packed the entire time we were there.  I do love the neighboring restaurants but it's nice to have a little bit of competition for inspiration.  So happy this is within walking distance for me!  Valet parking is complimentary, by the way, for those who drive.",

My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but it's just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.   Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.   The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says \"Complimentary\" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want.",

As soon as we arrived it was night and day difference. Parking is ridiculous and the place gets very crowded but after tasting the food you will know why.   We started with pork belly which is simply amazing. Honestly just delicious. We followed up with a round of pastas. I ordered the tagliatelle which is some of the best pasta I have had in my life. It is all made fresh in the open air kitchen - you can glance over and see it being made. NOTHING beats minutes old pasta in my book. The freshness elevates everything on the menu. Others had bucatini (think a thick spaghetti with a little bite) with meatballs - simple and delicious.   For dessert we had the salted caramel which was surprisingly perfect for a shared item. All in all just really great food and a  unique atmosphere. We brought others back on a second visit and everything again exceeded our expectations.   Takeaway: Skip the north NoRTH location and hit this one up. Its worth the parking headaches and the food is top notch.",

The spaghetti and meatballs are truly a thing of beauty! The flavor of the sauce along side that o so fresh pasta is like a dream. Meatballs done correct in a way that takes you back to mommas kitchen while giving you something new as well. What's stops a five star rating is it's staff and base clientele can be a little snarky and uninteresting. Also no real personality or depth with the decor in my opinion.

Oh, and there's a restaurant with seating and stuff too. But you have to turn left for that.  Thank goodness for the valet. Like Chelsea's, it's nice if you can score a spot early, but let them help you otherwise!  Maybe skip the white sangria - it was made to order and lacked the depth of a proper sangria, but wasn't potent enough to call a cocktail. Luckily, the other house cocktails are worth writing home about, some even come with an exotic floral garnish.  The salad was enough to share between two, but we should have then shared a pasta dish or gone for the cheese plate. The pizza we ordered was bland, the crust uninspired, but I might try it again anyway... with my own reorganizing of the toppings, perhaps?!  The staff is attentive, and knowledgeable. The decor to menu is a comfortable match (not always the strongest point of a Fox concept). And the crowd is pleasantly neighborhoody and good for people watching.",

First, we made reservations for 6pm and got seated right away, the hostess was happy and smiling when she seated us and the server came right to our table for our drink order and meal suggestions. We ordered our food and it came out super quick. My wife and daughter ordered the chicken parm, my younger daughter ordered the pasta with meatballs and I ordered the pesto. Everything, and I mean everything, was fresh and sooo good that I wish I would not have gotten full so I could've eaten more. This place is great from the valet, to the people that work in the restaurant, to the ambiance (the place is incredibly clean), to the fresh and tasty food, to the fair pricing...I will absolutely come back.",

    "text": "Yup, trusting Yelp with this recommendation was a fantastic idea. I was in Arcadia and wanted Italian food, nothing specific per se, I just knew I wanted something Italian and North was one of the first restaurants to pop up. After conferring with my dinner party of four, we were off.    We started with a pitcher of the best red sangria I've thus far experienced, winey yet fruity, spicy but mellow, it was good. Then we moved on to the mussels, which the table unanimously agreed that, even though between us we have eaten seafood all over the world, were the best version of any of the mollusk family we had ever eaten. Served in a butter sauce with slivers of garlic and salami, these things were damn near worth five stars alone. You must try them. Next best was the ricotta gnocchi, which although were very slightly doughy, had an incredible flavor profile with the horseradish sauce and ricotta. The seared diver scallops were also a hit, the scallops seared very well with a good cook, the risotto was tasty but got to be a little much at the end, it had a LOT of flavor. We also got a margherita pizza with a white sauce instead of the red, it was a good pie with a crispy crust and nice bite. The spicy shrimp dish was the low of the night, it did have a nice flavor but was just kind of a run of the mill pasta dish, I'd go with something more adventurous.   The fantastic food, incredible service(Stephanie I think), and inviting decor push this place over the top. North will for sure be in our regular rotation of restaurants from here on out.",

Bruschetta (tasty with the asparagus and prosciutto), Crisp Calamari (lemon vinegrette salad), Caesar salad (perfectly dressed), Olive oil cake (BEST olive oil cake I've ever tasted--topped with a citrus simple syrup...YUM), and chocolate tart, topped with mousse & toffee pieces (must be a chocolate lover, more of a winter dessert or if craving chocolate) definitely worth trying with your coffee. Beverages - Pinot Grigio and coffee.",

So cute.  An interesting cocktail menu and small starters of crispy chickpeas and fruity olives got me going. I wish they had more vegetarian/cheese free items on the menu.... The pizza my friend ordered was good, at least the portion of crust I tried anyway. Nice and chewy and not burnt. Dessert of fall apple crumble was insanely good but also insanely small of a portion   : / coulda eaten buckets of it. Will definitely go back",

    "text": "Been meaning to write about this place for so some time as I have eaten here  on a few occasions. Fox group never disappoints. North is exactly right. The food is wonderful and well priced. The staff are always friendly and know what they are doing from hostess, to servers to bar staff to management this is a well trained team. Obviously the back of house staff is on parr as the food here is always a delight and offers something for every palate.  Look up the menu online for details.  The BEST thing about North is their m-f happy hour specials! Decent red and White House wine and other drinks on special. Be sure to take a friend and have the Bottle and Board: a chef's board with meats, cheeses, nuts, olives, chutney, peppers served with fresh Italian bread with a bottle of house red or white for $20!! We sat at the bar and noticed that it seems the place to be to get a Friday night started. Lots of little clicks of guys and gals eyeing one another up over cheap nosh and booze! Definitely a go to for all the singles looking to mingle.  The place has several bike racks, and as we live a short pedal down the canal it's perfect for those like myself who like to justify pounding snacks and booze by imagining that the 15min totally flat ride there somehow counts as exercise! Fox group is hands down the most innovative and imaginative restaurant company and I happily continue to delight in frequenting their fine establishments. See you at the bar Friday at 5!",

They offer valet parking which wasn't necessary(maybe not when our party showed up at least). We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress right away. She got our drinks and dished out the specials answering all our questions and was very helpful with recommendations to the parts of our group that were first timers. The food was excellent starting with the patata pizza, bruschetta and calamari. We were all still trying to decide what to get so we also got the chef's board opting for the combination which didn't last too long. For dinner I got the seared diver scallops which was cooked perfectly on some awesome risotto. Our table got a community bowl of the bolognese our waitress suggested which was as great as she said it would be. All in all a great dinner to which I didn't hear any complaints and would recommend to anyone in the area or looking for somewhere nice to go with a group or on a date.",

    "text": "Tip - You have to utilize their \"complimentary valet.\" There is no way around it, the restaurant is located in an area with NO street parking within walking distance and the plaza across the street is off limits to NoRTH patrons.  Now onto the review: NoRTH is yet another great Fox Concepts restaurant to take a date, with just the right amount of mood lighting. I happen to enjoy looking at my boyfriend ;) so I wouldn't care if the room was bright as day, but you know how some fancy restaurants are just SOO dark that the song \"better with the lights off\" comes to mind? This is definitely not that, I don't like those restaurants haha.  ANYWAY, the decor is cute, decked out with a modern farmhouse feel and the plaid-shirt suited up service is IMPECCABLE. The food is pretty good too :)  Here's what we ordered:  $11 - Cheese & Bread platter: Melted Italian cheese with tomato jam + toasted Sourdough bread with olive oil -- this was pretty good, especially with the tomato and fruit jam in the middle of the cheese to spread onto the perfectly toasted bread. **NOTE: THIS IS A LARGE & FILLING APPETIZER   $17 - Rock Shrimp Pasta: VERY DELICIOUS! The noodles are playfully shaped and the sauce is a tomato base with a little citrus hint and some chili flakes. That's my personal description of it, but the menu description sounds way better - that's why I ordered it, and when I did, the waitress confirmed that it was her favorite pasta dish on the menu.  $15 - House Special Pizza - Fresh mozzarella, some type of Italian sausage (but it was very thinly cut, almost like prosciutto) and tomato sauce. This was okay in my book. Nonetheless, nice serving size and good taste - definitely enough for one person.",

    "text": "Dropped into this place for an early Saturday dinner. Place was packed which was a good sign but was seated fairly quickly regardless. Waitress was very good without being overbearing. Food was pretty good for Phoenix as Italian is not a strong suit in this town at all. I also appreciate the fact they make fresh pasta in house which was evident after eating the food. I had the ricotta gnocchi which was very tasty and my wife had the bacon and eggs pizza which was also excellent, and in my opinion way better than pizzeria bianco down the street that everyone raves about (I have no idea why). A few negatives which knocks this place down a few stars are first this place is very noisy, so much if fact it is very difficult to have a conversation without yelling across the table. My advice for anyone that wants a more intimate setting is to find another place, or maybe sit outside as the noise kills the mood. The other is while i was finishing my beer I put my mug down with a little over 1/3 left and a waiter came by and swiped it off the table before I could even notice assuming I was done. Really? If I am paying $7 for a CAN of beer you better make sure I am done, and even more maybe ask me if I am done?",

This place appeared to be bigger and more open spaced.  We really liked that.  The kitchen itself was also more open which gave a nice feeling all around.  Our server was very attentive and bubbly.  We ordered our usual zucca chips and opted to try the roasted cauliflower appetizer and split their kale salad.  Both were really good and it was nice that they split our salad plate up - and they were still large portions.  For our entree, I ordered the strazzopoli (spelling as I can't remember exactly the name), and the husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi with braised short ribs.  We both really enjoyed our entrees and even made room for dessert!  I think we'll start coming to this location more often as the space was a big factor for us.  We didn't feel like we were eating at other patrons tables.  They do have mandatory complimentary valet so we just tipped a couple of dollars when we left, even though the guy had to walk maybe 10 steps to get our car.",

    "text": "NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA (aka NoRTH Arcadia) misses the mark!!! All I got here was slight heartburn & Dirty Shoes & Pants!  How can a Sam Fox concept restaurant,  headed up by the former NOCA chef, Chris Curtiss miss the mark? If your a total Foodie like me, & you like Sauce - Pizza & Wine, olive & ivy, & Bloom you might be in for some disappointment!  When this restaurant was going up I had high hopes for it to be a neighborhood hang out. After all we have a few good restaurants in our neighborhood so one more adds to the selection of my favorite Arcadia hang-outs, and a Sam Fox Concept Restaurant in between Chelsea's Kitchen, The Grind, & LGO should only help minimize the wait time to get a table in any of these awesome eateries!(Woo-Hoo!!!)  Now who puts up a freestanding down to earth restaurant (as it's marketed) next door to U-haul, and only offers valet parking? (WTF!)  Oh yeah, the dirt floor outside patio as organic as it may look will cover your Italian loafers and nicely pressed Slacks in dirt! Seriously, not a good idea for couples on dates in their Sunday best, and expensive shoes. You can pretty much assume if you have a nice automobile that you will valet park, you are going to be dressed to impress, and when you leave dinner to go clubbing or  to your favorite watering whole you will look like a F--king  hobo!   Here is a suggestion, shoot your Architect & get either the guy who did The Parlor on Camelback or the Grind, and  fix not only the Patio, but also the dinning room! Your dinning room is not just Loud, but also very badly designed! (Seriously!)  The Arcadia NoRTH menu is based upon interpretation of traditional Italian cuisine, and is OK, but nothing here is making me say \"I'm craving NoRTH!\"  To be really frank, I like the Pizza and deserts @ LGO/PIZZARIA much better!!!  Sorry Sam but like Radio Milano the snob factor is much higher here than the dinning elegance that your menu pricing warrants!  NoRTH Arcadia (aka NORTH FATTORIA ITALIANA) is another upscale traditional Italian cuisine restaurant with the promise of authentic dishes without the \"snob factor!\"   The 4th time in the last ten years this restaurant concept has been tried in our neighborhood!!! Like the last 3 times I have to say this I don't see that special little something, \"je ne sais quoi.\"",

Apparently this used to be the location of a car wash, but you'd never know by the cool modern decor. It was pretty packed for an early dinner on a week night, but my party of 4 was lucky to score a table right away.  I'd recommend skipping the calamari because it was pretty disgusting, but the rest of our order was pretty awesome. Favorites including the zucca chips, meat and cheese plate and the spinach tortelloni. My goodness was that spinach tortelloni good. My buddy Sam knew what he was doing when he put that on the menu.  Actually based on my experiences in Phoenix Sam knows what he's doing when it comes to any restaurant!",

You can see each and every person sitting at their table as well as at the bar. Due to the atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend North for a romantic date simply because it's noisy and there's no privacy. However, this would make a decent setting for a fun and social get together.  After ordering our entrees, it took quite some time for them to come out. Unfortunately, the wait was not worth our food being undercooked and my date getting sick from her meal.  I'll give North one more shot to redeem my initial experience.",

Now, maybe I was really hungry from running, but this was pretty delish. I got the short rib hash and it was done right. The eggs were perfectly runny, the short rib was soft and flavorful, the potatoes were good....I'll be honest, I cleaned my plate. The mimosas were also top notch, as was the service. So why only 4 stars? They don't have any pancakes on their menu....why is this important? The husband is allergic to eggs and so he can't have any egg dishes or french toast, but can tolerate pancakes or biscuits and gravy...I wish this place would add some of those items to the menu so I can come here with him! Anyway, if they did that, I would be a regular.",

They treat me like a VIP but also some of them like a 'True Italian family' would.    Now I've been coming to this location for years & have had many of their dishes!  All very yummy!  Rarely had a problem & if I did; they took care of it immediately without me feeling like a bother.  Managers, wait staff & bussers has been very friendly, attentive & always take good care of me.  They make my dining experience here very enjoyable; which always make your food taste even better.   Great atmosphere to enjoy with friends, family & even by oneself!!  Great location in the Arcadia area.   Very nice happy hour (though I do miss having the spaghetti w/meatballs on their original HH menu from long ago ); especially like their all day Sunday HH.    Now this a FOX Restaurant Concepts but please realize this is not simply a chain along with many of his other successful restaurants but is owned & founded by Sam Fox who resides here locally.  So support LOCAL businesses I always say if you can.   Again delicious food with great service!    @eatnorthitalia",

My boyfriend got the pizza of the day which was great tasting and also a good deal (only $8!).",

    "text": "Driving over 2300 miles in three days wears. It also wears when you have your father in the car and in order to have a conversation, you have to constantly repeat yourself because he refuses to admit he needs to get hearing aids.  Phoenix was our last stop before home: Los Angeles. I was determined to treat ourselves, since New Orleans and the McDonald's in Fort Stockton were terrible disappointments, so I picked North Italia. I'm not even one for Italian food, to be honest. Why should I pay $15 for a tomato smashed into a pasta, made of flour and eggs? I mean, seriously. Not that hard, not terribly flavorful.  Until, of course, I found this place. There was one instance where I actually liked italian food, and it was at Michael Chiarello's restaurant up in Yountville, where you have to secure a reservation two months early along with the Keller restaurant group.  Obviously, I'm going to start with a drink. I believe it was called the Julietta, a vodka, elderflower, and prosecco mixed drink that came with a pretty flower as a garnish. It became my new favorite in all the ones I've had between the pacific and east coast. Yelp told me to get the zucca chips, so I did, because I am a sheep. Baaah. That's sheep for, \"You should get it. They're flash fried zucchini chips that taste like a slightly salty cloud, and are the perfect appetizer that won't fill you up before your meal.\"  Deciding on an entree was difficult. You see, the short rib and ricotta gnocchi looked good but - let's be real here - gnocchi is one of the easiest pastas to screw up. I went to a michelin star rated restaurant and ordered gnocchi thinking, \"How could they?\" and ended up getting an answer. So my expectations were certainly low. Instead, I was given pillowy pasta, with deep hints of ricotta, and some of the most amazing braised short rib I've ever had. Anywhere else usually makes their short rib saltier than the lick the cows get as a treat - but this, oh no. This was heaven. I could taste the beef in this spectacular sauce, and it was so good and simple. Never underestimate the power of simplicity. Good lord.  My dad had the strozzapretti, which I was not expecting to be good for some reason. I don't know, I have a crazy relationship with pasta. They hand-make it all in house, and just like the gnocchi, I felt as if I could eat it forever. Chicken, mushroom, fresh al dente pasta in a parmesan cream sauce. Amazing.  For dessert we had italian donuts with a vanilla marscapone sauce, and their nutella budino. The budino, topped with toasted hazelnuts, was great, but my favorite were the donuts. Airy things, dusted with granulated sugar and swept up with sauce, were the perfect way to end the evening. I was humbled, to be honest, and actually contemplated coming back out there with my boyfriend just to take him to the restaurant. It's still up for consideration, actually.  Make a reservation well in advance, I have a feeling this place isn't going to have slow nights anytime soon.",

It's fried in a fluffy batter and served over some vinaigrette greens and a grilled lemon half. I've tried the Italian Grinder and the Meatball Sandwich. Both sandwiches are delicious and served with smashed, well seasoned potatoes and a side of lemony mayonnaise.  I do have one actual complaint... the valet parking. I really don't get why so many phoenix restaurants have this unnecessary, forced valet parking. It's a bit annoying when I can park my own car and not feel pressured to tip someone when I didn't want valet service at all.   Other than the valet parking this is a place you must try!! Next time I hope to try the pizza or pasta. MmmmMm!!!",

    "text": "Gonna be a long one.  Came for friend's b-day, so we had a big long table out in patio. Also Free Valet parking on arrival.   Environment: love the aesthetics and factory feel and decor. good for groups and couples. Modern.  Service: friend and quick. Fast refills.   Pricing: overall on the more pricier side.   bathroom: love the M/F combine private bathrooms with a sink in each one.   Food:  prosciutto bruschetta  -$10.5 had a bite of this. There's a lot going on with a bite. first bite the  prosciutto and crescenza cheese is what you get. As you continue biting down, you get to this asparagus and and grana padano. So mouth full of cheese. If I had to get one appetizer, see the next one.   Crispy Calamari $13.5 Get it! not too much crusting that you don't taste the calamari. Just enough crush that doesn't hide the calamari. the lemon vinaigrette is legit.   White truffle garilc bread $12 didn't get to sample this until after it got cold...so harder to judge, Probably better when hot. But I could pass on this appetizer,   I personally had the strozzapreti - $18.5 consisting of the chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, pine nuts, and Parmesan cream. overall remind me of chicken Alfredo, but not. The noodle are STROZZAPRETI  which are elongated cavatelli. never had this kind, but I do like it. It is able to soak up the sauce. Chicken was grilled nicely, not dried, but juicy. The Parmesan cream sauce was not overwhelming to where you might get full of it before you're done with the dish. toasted pine nuts sprinkled in for extra dimension crunch. And mushroom throughout each bite. Pretty good.   Chicken pesto with zucchini noodle - $17 had a taste of this. If you are wondering about zucchini noodle, don't hesitate to use this kind.   diver scallops $25 mmm, had a bite of this as well. Big juicy, succulent and cooked to the right amount that the scallops melts in your mouth. Do recommend.   Roasted salmon $23  had a bite of this as well. again. Spot on with the cooking. Salmon wasn't dried and cooked just right. flavor was there but not overwhelming. Just salmon done right  Do recommend this place.   PS did not get to try the pizza.   I was full also.",

When we received an email about their community dinners we booked reservations & invited others to join.  It's so fun to sit at the community tables in the middle of the room & share the delicious food served family style, on platters, with enough for everyone. Most times we were able to come home with leftovers! YUM!!  We were lucky to attend 3 of the dinners & all were amazing each featuring a different region of Italy.  The food prepared divinely by featured Chefs, Tony Cardareiro & Timothy Thompson were so tasty, 4 courses with antipasto, second course of pasta (Primo), third course of protein (Secondo) & always a delicious Dolce, dessert. Each course  perfectly paired with wonderful wine chosen by Robertson the Sommelier.  All the above for $55!!  Such a deal! Unfortunately, the community dinners are on hold until next summer.  But its all good, North Italia is still serving fabulous meals & wines. You can check in with Robertson when dining at North & he will guide you to a great wine for your course.   Here are pictures from some of the dinners, we were too busy eating yummy food to take pics of all the courses of all the meals.  Bon Apetit!  This review is overdue, we've been busy remodeling.  These dinners were a joyful occasion during an extreemely stressful time.  Remodeling in Phoenix is challenging at best!",

We recently stopped in at the end of July and it was absolutely disgustingly hot.   Like leaving a sweat stain on the seat when you get up hot.  Everyone was glistening with sweat and most women were trying their hair up in various ways.    This reminded us of the last time we visited in the summer.  We were told the AC was broken.  Well it's 2 years later and it's still 'broken'.  Try and find a ceiling fan in any of the pictures.  No respite from the heat and humidity.  North is past it's heyday.  The menu is stagnant and the food prep and presentation show the lack of enthusiasm of the kitchen.  Everything is passable, but far from outstanding.  The pasta used to arrive steaming hot, now it is limp and lukewarm.  The owner recently sold his business to the Cheesecake Factory.  The attention to detail just isn't there any more.  The last nitpick is about the wine.  There are 3 prices for each available by the glass.  I think 6oz, 8oz and full bottle price.  And the names are like Starbucks where glass means 6oz and some other word means 8oz.  Skip the micromanaging if 2 ounces of wine.  The parking lot is full of BMWs, Mercedes and brand new full sized SUVs.  The clientele aren't struggling to make the scratch to cover the $2 price difference for that extra 2oz of wine.",

Chicken parmigiana and pasta in a creamy red sauce. This was delicious, everyone's favorite. Spaghetti and meatballs, thought the meatballs were a bit small. Pasta in bolognese sauce was good. Ended with Bombolini, round donuts served over a fresh cream sauce and vanilla gelato. Yummy. Living in New York with some of the best Italian food and comparing to what we're used to, this restaurant was ok.",

Another plus was the availability of food on the happy hour menu, as most happy hour menus elsewhere have a very limited selection. I will be back many times. I live close by and work close by.

    "text": "I've officially been to North once, but unofficially twice. The first was through trying brunch leftovers my husband brought home (The Pig pizza and Short rib gnocchi) and the 2nd I had to try for myself first hand. So first thing, parking lot is small. We happened to have reservations as they were opening, so it wasn't a problem. They have complimentary valet, kinda weird for such a small lot. But helpful. Interior is clean farmhouse rustic. I loved the family style table we were seated at, wish I could've taken that table home with us. Definitely great for groups, great for babies/kids. There is also a beautiful bar area, if its just a party of one or two. Now, for the food, that's really what u go for right? Ambiance is great and all, but what about the food? Top to bottom delicious, creative and executed to perfection.  Brunch Cocktail, first on the menu, The Red Rooster. An italian spin on a brunch favorite. Bloody mary with freshly crumbled parmesan mixed throughout and decorated with caprese. Caprese? Yes, one leaf of basil, tomato, and mozzarella. It sucks that I've never come up with this combination on my own. Bloody mary = tomato, italian = tomato, cheese, basil. Simple, creative, delicious. I would definitely get this again OR dare even try it at home.  Our chosen appetizers - zucca chips, bread board and custard filled donuts... is that a lot for appetizers, well yes, but that's not the point. Friends highly recommended the zucca chips, which I was more than willing to try even though I had no idea what they were. As it turns out, it isn't some exotic delicacy. Just fried zucchini. I don't say that lightly though because these were not the TGIFridays chunky cut, breaded, and fried zucchini. Zucca chips, were exactly that, chip-style - thinly sliced, slightly crispy, lightly salted, mini-zucchini goodness. Bread board has house-made rustic bread. Light, soft, airy on the inside with an crunchy outer crust. The usual thinly sliced charcuterie, cheese, olives, spiced mixed nuts, and a sweet chutney. Again, simple - but done well. Now, the unexpected we're the custard filled donuts. The very first menu item is pastries, choice of cinnamon rolls or custard filled donuts. We went with donuts. An order comes with 3, we got 2 orders. And they were nice enough to accommodate us with +1 for our party of 7. The donuts were unexpected because one, they are kinda hidden in the menu, and two - this place just screams savory - not sweet, but these little donuts (donut holes), crispy fried dough, dusted with powdered sugar, moist inside with a creamy lemon custard. That custard was so good, we were scraping it from the plate after having devoured our little tasty donut ball.  I was impressed with the short rib gnocchi i tasted from leftovers last week. Following that theme, I selected the short rib hash for my entree. I was not disappointed. Usually, my gripe,with hash - is the hash part. Usually too much potato. Not here. Perfect amount of short rib to potato. The hash was soft potato cubes with red peppers and onions. The short rib, moist and fall apart tender. All topped with poached egg. The egg yolk was soft but not runny. I would've preferred a runny egg, but did not affect overall taste. Buttered Toasted bread served on the side was so good. Toasted bread? Really - so good. One side was purposely burnt and it just worked.  It's a 45 minute drive, but will definitely come back -  gotta try more of the menu. Thanks to our friends for introducing us to North Fattoria Italiana. I don't even know what Frattoria means, but doesn't really matter. It is just good.",

You can see the chefs in the kitchen, the harmonious sounds of plates clanking together and food being chopped, it's wonderful. The food is obviously made fresh and so delicious. I love the $20 pizza and bottle of wine happy hour deal! My favorite vegetarian item is the arancini - it's mushrooms, risotto and cheese fried and sitting in a bath of a tomato sauce that is so good I could drink it!!",

The mushroom pizza (\"funghi\" to be exact) which was AH-mazing at the other location, but here it was a little dry... not as much cheesy mushroom-y goodness.  Was a little disappointed needless to say since I had been craving that pizza from the moment I licked the plate clean at Kierland.   The service was terrific though, we sat at the bar (wish I remembered the bartender's name). Drinks were good & strong and the ambiance was great, so I would still come to this one if in the area, but I'll make the extra drive to the more \"north\" North for my funghi fix.",

    "text": "Wow! Of all the restaurants in Phoenix North Italia is the best. As you see from my last updated review we had a bad experience with a take out order this evening. This was an isolated event and Chris the manager corrected the problem immediately and personally contacted us to make it right. They are changing their take out containers and they are fully committed to the satisfaction of their guests. Coming from a restaurant background I can tell you that the manager of North Italia is the example of a perfect manager and is the standard to which all restaurant managers should strive to achieve. We will be loyal customers of North from here on out and we will tell everyone about this spectacular establishment. As I have said many times the food is phenomenal and the experience you will have is top notch.  Don't let another day pass, try North and see for yourself. Bravo to North and Chris!  I am adding to this review and changing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star due to their take out. We loved North so much we went there tonight and ordered our favorite dishes. The hostess left our order sitting on the counter for 10 minutes at least. When I inquired I watched her get our take out that had been sitting there. She then lied and said it had just came out. When I got it home, I live 5 minutes away, our $60.00 dollar dinner was ice cold. To make matters worse their take out containers are made of paper and do nothing to keep your food hot. AND because they are paper they soaked up all the sauce off our pasta and the dishes were ruined. We threw them out. I am very disappointed with North. Bad service and cold food.  Food was absolutely delicious. We go to North for their Gnocchi, which is to die for! On this night they were out of the short ribs but the manager heard how disappointed I was and figured out a way to rush the fresh batch of short ribs they were making so he could make the gnocchi happen for me. If by some bizarre reason you haven't tried North go there ASAP. You will absolutely love it. Don't forget to end your meal with the salted caramel pudding it's divine",

I have had their gnocchi, a few of their pizzas, and their seasonal vegetable salad and I still don't know which I like better. The pizzas are hand-made and the crust isn't too thick or too thin-just right! They have really delicious pizza toppings and a variety of pizzas to choose from. Their egg pizza with bacon is really great and so is their fig and prosciutto pizza! I just had their salted caramel bambino, essentially a caramel creme fraiche, and it was pretty darn great. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is their coffee-I had a cup and it tasted a little burnt. However, I doubt most people come here to get a cup of coffee. I especially love that they have all day happy hour on Sundays with great deals on food AND booze. Definitely a must-try.",

    "text": "I have so many feelings about North Italia, I don't even know where to begin!  I'm going to preface this review by saying that I was given a list of about 10 restaurants that serve lasagna and this was the one I picked!  We got to the restaurant & I'm not a huge fan of valet parking so it was a bit of a disappointment that they didn't have an option to self-park but for the sake of convenience, it was alright. I had made a reservation so we were seated at a table right away. The ambiance was great; equally perfect for a date night or for a group dinner with friends. Also really appealing is the all-day happy hour on Sundays!  After a quick glance, we decided on sangria & beer to drink and Zucca Chips to snack on. They all came out in a reasonable amount of time & we were enjoying away. The sangria was different, not as strong I expected, but still good. The Zucca Chips were highly addicting! -- Just a note that if you order them, consider asking for some lemon aioli dip! Delicious.  When our waiter came back around, we were ready to place our meal orders. We were SO disappointed when they told us the lasagna was all out!! After much debate, we went with the Strozzapreti & the Spinach Tortellini. The Strozzapreti was rich & hearty, the portion was large enough that I was able to have a little leftover for the next day. Mushrooms & spinach in the sauce were the highlights. I'd consider asking them to leave off the chicken & add more of the veggies if I got it again. The Spinach Tortellini was good, much lighter than the Strozzapreti. Again, the mushrooms & sauce went well with the pieces of Spinach Tortellini. We rounded out our meal with some Italian Donuts - not sure the hype about those; they were alright, but didn't leave much of an impression.  I will say that I think our experience would've been much better if we were in the mood for any pasta. Since we were pretty much banking on getting the lasagna, it was really hard to make up for it. I haven't crossed this off the list and REALLY want to come back for the lasagna!!",

Everything on the menu looked amazing but I opted for the short rib hash. Food was delicious as expected. There are a variety of delicious sounding alcoholic drinks but I opted for their freshly brewed coffee.   My friend ordered their yogurt bowl that I wish I had ordered too. It was enormous and so so good! I will have to order that for myself next time. Overall, a great Saturday brunch and a great spot to hang out and catch up with friends.",

    "text": "Trying to order Pizza in Arcadia wasn't the easiest task on a Saturday night during a holiday weekend. After the majority of places showed either closed or a 45 minute wait, I stumbled upon North on the yelp app. And stumble, we did.   We walked down to the North bar with the intention of getting some late night grub. We were pleasantly surprised when the entire menu was quite affordable. For a cheese pizza, sangria and a beer it was $28. The pizza was mouthwateringly delicious despite the fact that it was just a basic cheese. It's definitely something you can scarf down and split for a great date.   The sangria was some of the best I've ever had. I don't like sweet drinks, but much to my surprise this was a very winey and strong sangria. Just my style! I was so happy with it that it's going to be one of my staple places to go now.  The bartender was so polite and nice. Instead of being annoyed with us for walking in an hour shy of closing, he welcomed us with ample suggestions. He never rushed us and was the appropriate amount of attentive.   Their menu is consistently good across their locations. I've had the greatest salads here. Their salmon is to die for. It's safe to say this is in my top five favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

We also got the artichoke appetizer, which was good but not as good as the calamari.  For my entree I ordered the Bolognese.  I felt like $17 was a little high for a little meat sauce on top of noodles, but the noodles were SO GOOD!  they make their pasta fresh every day and you can really taste the difference between fresh pasta and the other kind.  well worth the $17 I think  Also we were able to get in and out in an hour and 15 minutes, which was good since it was a work day",

It appears they had a special once a month dinner that night.  We had to sit on the patio and the evening was very warm.  What a surprise, the misting system actually made it pleasant.  We ordered fried  calamari for starters.  No dipping sauce but a grilled lemon was good on it. Next I had squid ink pasta with shrimp and calamari with a red spicy sauce, and he had the chicken parm. Both dishes were good but not fives.  We skipped the desert.  Overall a nice meal, friendly and attentive servers.   The noise level in the dinning room might have been damaging to your hearing, I found it to be painful and that made the patio even better!  I would rate the total experience a 3 !/2 stars.",

The look and ambience of the restaurant is beautiful and inviting. I love the high ceilings, open kitchen, and large windows. While the valet is nice, I would like to have it be an option instead of forced.   We skipped appetizers and went straight for the pizza. I ordered the Margherita, which was okay. A third of the crust was burnt and the basil was placed sparingly (the worst for me because it's my favorite). My boyfriend ordered The Pig which was delicious! Just a little greasy but that's a given. The dessert menu was hard to choose from but I ended up going for the Olive Oil cake. OH MY GOD that was the best decision I made. I loved the mix of textures and it was a perfect satisfaction to my sweet tooth. Totally recommend!!  Our service was a little slow but our server, Erik, was so sweet. He apologized before we left and thanked us for our patience since it was his first week. It was obvious he was trying his best and it was pretty busy that night. We thought he was great!!  After today I'm eager to be back soon for brunch! And probably again for dinner so I can try a pasta dish!! ;)",

    "text": "The short: Contemporary Italian fare (pasta, pizza, and various entrees) with prices to match; tasty but slightly pricey ten-dollar cocktails; service was fast and friendly; food came out quickly; ambience fit for an intimate, dress-nice date night, clean, well-lit, modern, and comfortable--think trendy barn and without the cruddy acoustic so many hip restaurants have these days.  The long: Located on a narrow lot on the east side of 40th St., just south of Camelback, tucked away a bit so it can be easy to miss, pull in and there will be free, fast, efficient, valet parking, and the valets aren't all scary if you don't tip because who walks around with dollars anymore? They get it, and they're great. As for the restaurant, like a Tardis, the place seems bigger on the inside than it does on the outside, so despite having lots of seats and a small parking lot, you don't necessarily feel cramped, though the servers have to be adept at maneuvering.   I made reservations (the site uses Open Table) just in case, which was super fast and easy, and met my friend for dinner. Service was quick and attentive without being obtrusive. It was a special dinner, so we went to town: shared zucca chips, arancini, I ordered short ribs, she had strozzapreti, and shared bombolini.   There's no graceful way to eat zucca chips. It's like the claw machine in arcades where you can fish around and try to win toys. They're too small and delicate to eat like regular chips unless you want to dainty your way through an hour of eating just that, so you just pick up a delicate ham-fistful, look up, open wide, and season your mouth. If you love fried zucchini, you might be disappointed--these are fried (and stay nice and crispy even as we continued snacking on them after our entrees), and they're zucchini (and taste like it), but they're barely substantial. They're tasty and salty, though, so at least worth a try. I liked the arancini better--moist, soft, fried rice balls? Yum. Take generous advantage of the marinara they're served on--that's where their flavor comes from.   My friend's strozzapreti (chicken, roasted mushroom, spinach, toasted pine nut, parmesan cream) was really good, cooked perfectly tender, tasty pasta and juicy chicken, and I tasted a lot of garlic mingling with the parmesan in the sauce even though the ingredient isn't featured in the dish's description. By a lot, I mean just right. I really liked my short rib, the meat itself being the highlight--soft, moist, flavorful--no complaints. I wanted polenta so I got I ordered the short rib as the main instead of with the pasta, but the polenta was a bit runny and added nothing to the dish; I couldn't get enough of a mouthful to find a flavor. I know polenta is often served soft, but if I think a spoon is a better eating utensil, then that's too soft. As usual, I was wishing for more veggies even though the carrots and onions were perfectly fine. I guess I think government-approved portions are the goal to aim for and I want half the plate to be produce.   Everything on the dessert menu looked enticing, but we split the bombolini, and I have nothing bad to say about fried dough that has a thin, crispy shell on the outside and is cooked all the way through. I think at one point, the restaurant filled the bombolini with custard, but now, they're just served on a bed of vanilla mascarpone custard sauce and Meyer lemon curd--a good counterbalance of soft and sweet and brightly puckery for summer.  I drank a Julietta, vanilla and ginger-infused Smirnoff, St. Germain, lime, and prosecco. It was such a well-rounded drink--I thoroughly enjoyed sipping it throughout dinner even though I easily could've chugged it down, it was so nice. The karma orchids they dress the drink with are edible, but I've never found them particularly tasty, so I let it just sit and be pretty in the empty glass.",

The artichoke is a great app here as well.

If this is the way you treat a pick up order I can't imagine how it would be actually eating there.",

We went with a few friends this last time and everyone left happy and full.   My favorite here is the short rib radiatori. So good it was main course all three times I've eaten here. Simply fantastic. We also had the heirloom tomato burrata, crispy calamari, Caesar salad, Bolognese, margherita pizza, Bianca pizza and some cocktails.   Everything is very fresh and tasty. Drinks are good with a full bar selection.  Recommend making a reservation.  Ambiance: 5 Service: 5 Food: 5 Drinks: 4",

    "text": "One of my favorite Italian places , if not my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale area . The food is always delicious, and I've tried almost all of their pasta dishes . My absolutely favorite and the one I keep getting is the squid ink . The black noodles are fun and unique to eat , and the sauce is divine ! Another favorite is the braised short ribs - both the pasta and the entre ! The meat is extremely soft and tender. My partner liked the sauce , but I wasn't a huge fan - I liked the meat though ! For the appetizer , we didn't really care for the bruschetta; I'm not a huge fan of fake truffle oil but that's just me .    The staff has always been nice and accommodating. One time I brought my puppy in a doggie backpack and the waitress allowed us to stay inside the restaurant because it was blazing hot out . We really appreciated that ! Overall a solid 5 star place !",

They brought it out like a salad.  The calamari was glazed in a yummy sauce too.  Four thumbs up  The missus got the chicken parmesan and she said two thumbs up.    Noodles got the squid ink pasta and she said two thumbs up.   I got the Bolognese again and two thumbs up.  Me and Noodles got the tiramisu.  It was not like a cake but in a bowl with the whipped like substance and wafer texture something inside.  Four thumbs up.    I did sample a bite of the chicken parmesan and the squid ink pasta and they were tasty.   We will be back.",

The place we were going to eat at was full (since it was a Saturday night) so we decided to check out this place! They only have valet parking so when you pull up into the small lot, you're right by the entrance. Despite it being crowded, we were seating within five minutes (we sat out on the misted patio). The ambiance is great for a date night!   I was so excited to see that they had plenty of gluten-free options on the menu. All their pasta dishes could be substituted with gluten-free noodles or vegetable noodles. I got the Bolognese pasta (which is one of their specialties) and subbed it with veggie noodles! The veggies noodles were absolutely delicious and worked so well with the meat sauce! They also weren't super crunchy which I really liked!   My date got the chicken parmigiana with came with some parmesan rigatoni! Everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful. ALL pastas at made in house DAILY so I suggest checking out one of the dishes to experience the delicious noodles.   Also, for anyone who is gluten-free the zucca chips AREN'T gluten-free because they are cooked in the same oil as fried food. HOWEVER, our awesome waitress said the grilled cauliflower was safely gluten-free. I'm so happy we came across this place because it's now one of my favorites!",

The FRC group built this from the ground up to be a community focused gathering spot for everyone, singles to large groups included.  The open kitchen and barn-like interior space are reminiscent of a Farm-to-Table ideology.  I know for a fact they make the pasta in house, not sure of the amount of local produce that they procure though.  I normally order the Mafaldine pasta and the Arancini Risotto Balls, and occasionally the Bolognese or a pizza special of the day.  In the fall and spring, we love the patio and the artistic cement tiles.  Another great aspect of North is the Complimentary Valet!",

Very efficient, friendly, and professional.  Loved my radiatori.   The short rib was melt in my mouth tasty.   I must admit, the dish was a bit on the maybe over-salted side, but not really that much.   Quite creamy.  The sandwich came with what appears to be fried (?) baby potatoes.  I couldn't tell.   Some of it was dry and overcooked.   The sandwich was delish.   Just the right amount of seasoning and a good size piece of chicken.  Yummm.   Yes, I would return.",

My favorites are the pig pizza, meat and cheese boards, pasta (any kind), zucca chips...oh gosh it's all good! My only knock on North is that the prices are very high for the portion sizes. Honestly you are better off ordering from the kids menu for better prices and the same portions. Both dine in and take out are always flawlessly done.   The atmosphere in North is hip and happening. I actually prefer to carry out because it's somewhat loud, crowded, and hard to have good conversation inside, but that seems to be the popular thing these days. The color scheme, large building with vaulted ceilings, outside patio, and decor are beautifully done and I do see why people enjoy dining there. The wait staff is well versed on the menu and always friendly and attentive. It does get crowded, so you'll want to get a reservation or get there early. However if you don't mind waiting there is a great bar area in the corner of the restaurant that is perfectly placed to compliment the flow of the restaurant and not be the centerpiece. Parking can be a challenge, so I recommend using their valet even if it is a few extra bucks.   North is a fantastic Italian restaurant that has delectable food, a friendly and fun environment, and is perfect for date night or the whole family. If you're craving a good pasta meal do yourself a favor and check it out.",

    "text": "WOW!!!! This restaurant is definitely worth a visit. I came here for a girls night and was blown away by the atmosphere, decor, food, and service!! For parking, there is a complimentary valet right outside the restaurant that is very convenient! We were seated immediately to our table reserved for 14 of us. I was honestly impressed with their ability to host such a large party considering the restaurant doesn't really look that big! We all arrived around 7:45 and the restaurant was still pretty busy. The restaurant itself is really cute and decorated well! I ordered the strozzapreti pasta and absolutely loved my dish. The roasted mushroom gave the pasta such a delicious flavor along with the Parmesan cream and toasted pine nuts. The pasta itself was also cooked to perfection. I was also able to try the Bolognese since my friend and I shared the two dishes. While I enjoyed the strozzapreti more, the Bolognese was also delicious. The meat sauce had a good amount of meat within the tomato base and the tagliatelle noodles were the perfect vehicle for the sauce.  For dessert, I ordered the hazelnut torta. I was pretty disappointed that they were out of the bombolini because I had seen so many photos of the donuts, but I was not at all disappointed with my choice. The salted caramel gelato was so creamy and delicious on its own, but the cake itself was so flavorful and both complimented each other well. The hazelnut toffee added a nice crunch to the dish and the Nutella cream just made this dessert that much more decadent! I am so pleased with my visit. My only critique would be that the restaurant itself is a tad bit loud when full, but otherwise, definitely give this restaurant a try!",

The waiter was welcoming, constantly refilling my water and offering insight on the menu. I can always expect great service here. The food is magnificent especially the truffle butter bread which is addicting like crack. I tend to always get the bolognese.

The bartender was great and openly suggested food items.  Burrata Alla Panna - grilled asparagus, caper vinaigrette, toasted almonds and mustard bread crumbs. DELICIOUS! The mozzarella on there was amazing. I ordered the gnocchi and the beef short ribs were very tender and mouth watering.  The service was good by the bartender.  My only bad comment is nobody got our food placement right. Even Amy, the owner, sat our plates down wrong. We even watched another server try to hand our dessert to another customer. We were in seat #1 and #2 at the bar...how can you get that wrong?  It was a great place to people watch.  I would go back and would definitely recommend the wonderful salted caramed budino. The sea salt and caramel were a great combo!",

It seems it would be difficult to strip flavor from Italian food but they managed it.  Both dishes were surprisingly, disappointingly bland.    Other things we noticed - it's very loud inside, so if you want to talk without yelling hit the patio.  It also seems a little pricy for what you get.  In short, if you're looking for some good Italian with a neighborhood feel do yourself a favor and make the short drive west to Giuseppe's (28th and Indian School.)",

    "text": "First I have to say that I've only been once and only had appetizers (several as I was with a group on business). We had cocktails, pizzas, and several of their cheese and meat trays.  I wasn't excited to go as I used to have a North in my neighborhood in Glendale and was not impressed. I've also been to the Scottsdale location and the white leather, super modern motif doesn't really do it for me. The food was always \"just ok\" too, especially for the price.  Things have changed. The North in Arcadia is set up to look like a rustic Italian kitchen. I give major kudos for the pasta being freshly made by hand.  The cocktails I was having (called the Quiet Italian Gentleman) were a fantastic mix of rye, amaretto, and two other Italian liquors. Yum!  Another cool note is that they use a hand cranked deli slicer to slice their meats in order not to melt the wonderful fats in the meat. I've never seen this before and enjoyed the touch.  Pizzas were fair to good, but pizza is a tough nut to crack. I think I had every meat and cheese they offered. Every one was quite nice.  The only draw back was that it was HOT inside, which is apparently a problem as the manager came by to advise that an additional unit is being installed so this shouldn't be an issue going forward.  Our server was also excellent.  I'll be back.  PS Parking is valet only, which annoys some people. Not me since it is complementary and makes me feel special so its worth the couple buck tip.",

Maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed I've been in the past at other places, but this place is great. It seems that italian is Fox's strong area.  The decor is cool, the integrated kitchen is appealing and all in all it's a great concept.  I had the cheff's board, 2 cheeses, 2 meats and some other goodies. The ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good. Maybe a little bit of more cheese wouldn't hurt.  The pork belly was good. Not in the amazing side, but pretty decent.  I ordered spinach tortelloni and it was great, full of flavor and with grana padano, I mean, there's nothing not to love when it comes to grana padano.  The desert wasn't that great but maybe I was already full.  The double espresso was good.",

    "text": "I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to. There were just too many problems with our brunch at North. The best way for me to explain the 2 stars is to give you a breakdown of our experience.   We arrived at North and right away I have to say that I liked the look of the place. Very cool barn design with tons of windows and a bar that is very inviting. Well things changed as soon as we went in. First off the place was maybe 30% full so there was a ton of seating. We were shocked to hear that there was a 15 minute wait. Now I know a little about the restaurant business and it could have very well been that they were short staffed. I still think it is a much better experience for people to be seated and explain your situation.   While we were waiting outside I decided to go to the bar to get some coffee for us. The bartender didn't acknowledge me and instead decided to help the people that came in after me. I moved down the bar hoping it was because she didn't see me. Well that wasn't it because I got another 5 minutes of her avoiding me like I was Kris Humphries at a Kardashian family reunion.   Finally she took my order to which she tried having two other people fulfill it. Needless to say we were seated before I even got the coffee. Bad service.  Once we were seated things seemed to get better. We had a very nice waiter and he was very quick with getting us drinks and our order. When the food arrived things went downhill again.   My girlfriends eggs were so salty her blood pressure went from 110/60 to 180/120. She only had one bite. Her oatmeal was also missing apples which was a big part of it. She was very disappointed. Mine wasn't much better. My breakfast sandwich is something I could make at home. Very plain roll with overcooked fried egg and two skinny pieces of bacon.  The potatoes were fantastic though. Odd they give you a thick aioli that ruins the potato. Just avoid it.  I can only review this place on its brunch. I haven't been here for dinner and not really sure I will give it another try. The service from the bartender and the very sub-par food makes me want to spend my money elsewhere. There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that appreciate the business.",

For our meal we got the bolognese pasta, margherita pizza and the pig pizza.  The pasta and pizza dough are made fresh every day.  The pig pizza was a little salty for me but that is just because of all the different meats.  All the food was very good.  Not the best I've had but very good.  We will definitely will be back.",

When our dinner was brought out one of my sisters had ordered pizza and no plate was given to her. She passed us a couple of times and never really bothered to check up on us. However, when we were just finishing up dinner our waitress brought us the check. I told her she didn't offer us dessert. She offered a quick \"sorry\" and took back the check. We had just barely finished eating. She did go and get menus but our birthday celebration was ruined. We felt rushed and couldn't enjoy the rest of our time there. Wish this night would have gone different for my sister. However, overall the food was ok, maybe it had something to do with the way we were treated. Don't think I would go back if this is common for North to have service that makes me feel unwelcoming.",

We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress....  The concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed.  We were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh?  We ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.    I had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.  Maybe they are still working out their kinks but this place probably won't be high on my list to return any time soon!",

    "text": "the meatballs are the BEST ever.  I do not like any meatballs excpt for my own or my mom's.  BUT North Italia's stack up to those.  They are delicious.  at lunch try the meatball sandwich.  For dessert, try the finger licking bombolini.  Absolutely yummy!!  only complaint was for my daughter's kids burger, it was dry as all can be.  for appetizers, try the calamari and artichoke.  Truly everything you order is wonderful (except the kids burger, which is too bad)",

    "text": "Went with a friend early on a Sat. (6pm) for dinner.  I'm glad we went a little early because the place filled up fast.  Wait staff/service:  Welcomed by a staff member actually opening the door for me (nice touch).  Promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the wine list and menu.  The waitress was also perfect in her timing...checked in enough to make sure we were happy, but not too much as to make you feel rushed.  Food/Drinks:  My friend had the house Pinot Grigio and I had a Negroni Nuovo (these things could be dangerous...a great drink for a summer day).  We split Antipasti (bread & cheese...this was yummy, although the name could be improved) and Insalate (Italian...also a boring menu name, but was tasty as well).  We both had pasta for our main course...Tagliatelle and Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both of us thought the pasta was delicious...perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Dessert:  We split the Salted Carmel Budino.  It was so good, I almost ordered one to go.  Rich as Budino should be, but light enough so as not to put you in an after dinner coma.  Price:  If you want to try the traditional multi-course Italian meal, the prices can add up.  Our meal for 2 came to ~$110 (including 1 drink each and the tip).  For a casual dining atmosphere, some may consider this too pricey.  Other comments:  I read other comments about a problem with flies.  This must have been overcome, because we didn't notice any.  This is a restaurant I will visit again to sample some of the other menu items.",

Located near the Biltmore I was expecting something more stuffy, but I arrived I was greeted by a lovely open aired building with a very nature friendly design. I chose to dine outside on the patio and was greeted very quickly by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful.   I ordered the Strozzapreti and my friend ordered the seasonal vegetable salad with an appetizer of steamed mussels. When the mussels came out I was very satisfied with the amount they gave us, however when the main courses arrived I was a bit surprised. The food was beautiful and well presented however I felt like I was eating a side pasta for $17. Despite the size of the food it was very flavorful and very fresh. y friend was a little put off the size as well, but enjoyed her food as well.   I feel that it was a nice experience and that the atmosphere was nice. However I thought it was a bit over priced for the amount you got. Despite this it is still worth a try and I suggest you come on a week day during lunch when it is not so busy.",

    "text": "Another great offering from Fox Concept Restaurants. Bravo.  The building looks like a giant barn, and the interior resembles a barn as well. But don't be fooled; this restaurant is CLEAN as a whistle and the lighting is spot on. The servers and bartenders are dressed in jeans and other farm attire so they do look a little goofy, but it works. It just works. The bartenders actually care about you enjoying your experience. They're not there to puff up their chests and flex for the girls. These guys know customer service and they are spectacular.  The food?! Heavenly. The arancini was perfect and the sauce divine. But the real treat was the main course: I tried the Bolognese, which is something I have perfected (in my opinion!) at home. I'm very picky. Luckly, they did not disappoint. The bolognese was very moreish and I could not stop eating. I left a very happy man. Kudos to the guys scurrying around in the open-air kitchen!  And now for my one (and only) bitch about this restaurant: and I nearly took away a star because of it. JUST as the sun was setting, the bartenders took it upon themselves to open all the window-doors surrounding the bar. It's nice, but only when it's 79 degrees outside! And the sun...burst forth and blinded me along with anyone else sitting westward. All the nice cool air just slipped out the restaurant and it became quite uncomfortable.  Yes, I know it's Friday night and you want the restaurant to seem as open as possible...but it's already A BARN! You do not need to open all the windows in the middle of summer...and especially when the sun is still able and willing to stun and piss off your diners.   This restaurant, despite the only one flaw, is a masterpiece. (And guys, STOP going out in public wearing flip flops or sandals. You all look ridiculous.) I step off my soapbox.",

Excellent management, friendly (and dare I say very attractive) bar staff, delicious new drink offerings, and the free WiFi I've always loved. A great place to pull up a seat and work from my laptop.  They have also accommodated a menu request that my best friend asked for and have subsequently made it for me. We appreciate that tremendously. I plan to resume riding my cruiser bike to North to park it in the ample bike parking spaces as well as taking my car to the friendly, fast valet on the chillier nights. Excellent.",

However, the hostess did comp a free appetizer for our long wait, so that was awesome. In addition, the wifey and our friends from out of town had no complaints of the food, so that is deserving of 4 stars. I guess my only complaint is I have to try this place again with ordering something different.

It was certain good, but everything had a pro/con dichotomy (I'm just trying that word out for a bit).  Case in point:  Food was good, but it was an unusual pricing menu.  My partner got a margherita pizza, allegedly made from scratch, for a few dollars less than my spaghetti (no meatballs).  I couldn't understand why spaghetti cost more than making a pizza - a bit odd to me.  Point #2:  The atmosphere was really upbeat and fun, but we sweated like crazy.  The \"farmhouse\" atmosphere felt like just that - a farmhouse.  We were told they're trying the best they can, but it wasn't helping too much.  We were sweating during parts of the meal.  Overall, I think I would come back.  Since I recently gave up eating red meat, I think the spaghetti, although kind of pricey, is a force to be reckoned with.  I would just enjoy it more in a better climate-controlled environment.",

Granted, it's complimentary, but what kind of a jerk doesn't tip the valet?  We had meatballs for our app. Umm, delish!!! So moist and yummy, plus the toast that comes with was to die for!  Next was marguerita pizza. It was a little salty for my liking, but still very yummy.  We sat at the bar, and our waitress/bartender was SUPER sweet and attentive! I give her 5 stars all on her own!  Definitely will make this a regular spot, but I might ride my bike next time (they have bike locks on the patio!)",

It was simply average although it is says it is a house specialty.  My co-workers had the Fall Lasagna and Strozzapreti and enjoyed it as well.  Wonderful flavors and it was a joy to sit outside during the evening with the warmth of the heaters.    The ambiance of the place is nice.  The staff is friendly enough, but didn't impress me with outstanding service.  I recommend it.  You can always head down to LGO for a little dessert after!",

Even though we ended up sitting at the bar,  she was willing to work some magic to get me in, considering it was a Friday night and I had not made a reservation. The bar staff was very attentive and quick to refill a drink or make sure you had your order in.   Now, the food was overall pretty good. I felt the meatballs were a bit underwhelming, but the main courses were great. The manager Chris though, he is the star of this place. He came over during our meal asked how everything was and genuinely cared. My mom, who I was treating to dinner, had the rosemary chicken, and while she liked it, was not blown away. Chris wouldn't have this. He specifically went back to the kitchen and had them re-do it to the nines. When it returned, she was more than impressed. We were already willing to return and give the place another try. But with this kind of service, I'm definitely sold, and going to recommend it to everybody I can.  Great place!",

    "text": "\"A wonderful evening and dining experience!\"  We were greeted warmly by the Assistant GM Jonas and offered a table on the patio, but opted for inside due to the Heat in July.  Misters were nice on the patio, but still wanted a cooler setting.  We sat in a wonderful high top table directly facing the kitchen and were able to watch all the amazing chefs create delicious looking dishes.  BTW.....try one of the meat or cheese boards.  :).  Our Server Kyle did an amazing job!  We started off with the steamed mussels in a savory wine and garlic broth with small amounts of Italian spicy meats.  Delicious fresh mussels served with great toasted dipping bread!  If you like mussels, you will love this dish.   My girl had never been to North and I forgot to order the Zucs!  A must have at North......\"just order them\".... You will Love them!  We then ordered the spicy shrimp pasta dish and shared it and it was delicious.  Great homemade pasta, savory shrimp with a slight kick, but not to spicy and great secret flavors.  (Leaks were used to make the sauce).  We also forgot to to order a salad prior to our pasta and were encouraged to try the seasonal veggie salad. Next time for sure. ( we paired our meal with a wonderful bottle of a Red Blend..\"Dreaming Tree\"...moderately priced and very nice....not to big and dry, just nice and only $26 as I recall.   We ended our great meal with an Epic chocolate tort/moose with a delicious rich nuttela sauce on it.  Overall...great food, good pricing, fantastic service and a fun place.  The only reason not 5 stars was its a bit noisy, but you quickly get acclimated to it!  Thanks Jonas and Kyle....you both did great!  We will be back.....",

    "text": "We have not been here in quite a while, because it has gone downhill. We used to eat here ALL THE TIME. I am vegetarian, so I would always get the spaghetti marinara, the beet salad, and probably three glasses of Barbera. The last time we went, the spaghetti marinara had been taken off of the menu, so I just got the beet salad. Unfortunately, it was nothing like what I ordered in the past, and was WAY overdressed to the point of being inedible. They do have an arancini appetizer that is vegetarian, but I really miss their spaghetti marinara, it was the reason I went there. Such a disappointment.  Went back last night because the manager responded to my review and told me I can still get the spaghetti marinara. I ordered it and it was amazing as always. Had a lovely evening out with ma man, vino, and good conversation.  So we went back a while back, and yes, I got the spaghetti marinara, and it was terrible. Flavorless. I really wish that restaurants would take vegetarian and vegan dishes as seriously as they take their other food. We like good food too. If I owned a restaurant, I would see to it that every menu item was exceptional. If they don't know what good vegan/vegetarian food tastes like, they should consult with vegans and vegetarians. I will not give this place another chance. I'm done.",

FOOD-  Appetizer: we had the grilled artichoke. The flavor was spot on--BUT it was WAY over cooked.  Entrees: We ordered the Gnocchi w/ Braised Beef in a light Horseradish Cream Sauce, it was FANTASTIC!! I could have licked the bowl it was so damn good--but I was in public. We also ordered the pizza w/ egg, potato, and bacon on it. It was like breakfast on a pizza and man that was a great breakfast pizza. We will definitely be going back just for the pizza.

I could eat that salad every day.  It's the perfect salad for me.    Shared the tortolloni, which was good, but I wouldn't get it again, but am glad I tried it.  I will plan to try another pasta another time as the pasta itself was really good.  Shared the bombolini with my mom for dessert, which was good but we were too stuffed to really enjoy it.

The homemade pasta has an excellent texture and the sauces are up to the same standard. The wine selection is diverse and well priced and the cocktails are unique and presented well.    The service is a little lack luster. I believe it to be because of the high level of business, not because of some low level of standards. With that aside, the table to space ratio is off. You are either sitting right on top of one another or you are bumping into others trying to get to your table. This can be quite annoying on the other end because people are also bumping into you while you are trying to enjoy your meal.         The 3 star review will not deter me from coming here again. The food, the wine, and the sense of passion behind them is what makes this place stand out. I hope to receive better service next time and perhaps a little more space to breath.",

It is billed as having a rustic, farmhouse atmosphere - I guess that explains the blue jeans and plaid, western-style shirts on the servers (really?? Isn't that better suited to a rustic, western atmosphere??) That said, the place does have a certain lively vibe and energetic atmosphere. They offer both inside and patio seating, although neither outside area offers a particularly nice view - either the parking lot or 40th Street and the shopping area across the street. But when the weather's nice, it's always a treat to eat outside.  We started with the bruschetta which was very, very good - a sign of more goodness to come! Our entrees included: spinach tortelloni, spicy shrimp and the pig pizza. The homemade spinach pasta was delicious and stuffed with mouth-watering cheese in a herb butter sauce. I could've done with about half the butter only because I'm not a butter fan, but must admit it was very flavorful. We were a little apprehensive that the shaved fennel on the spicy shrimp would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. The dish was beautifully presented over homemade pasta and was very flavorful - worth ordering again! The pig pizza - so called because of its 4 pork meats - was good, too. The crust baked to perfection (no nasty burn areas).  Our service was fine - attentive, friendly and not hovering. This restaurant is in a great location and the complementary valet is a plus since the parking area is limited.  Definitely returning - sounds like a Sunday Happy Hour is in my future!",

It was hoppin' on a Wednesday night and we luckily grabbed the only two open seats at the inside bar.  I had eyed someone's salad and immediately thought that is what I will be ordering.   We started off with drinks.  I really liked the creativity with their drink menu. KD had the midnight shandy ($9.5) which she enjoyed.  Shandies are an interesting concept, incorporating beer and booze. It was so hot out that a nice light white wine sounded good to me.  I went with the vino di tavola- white.  A nice pinot grigio ($5).   We had the grilled summer squash ($7) for our starter.  There are yellow raisins included in a major way on this squash.  Raisins are not my thing and it's not mentioned on the menu about the raisins  but it was a tasty app.  I would've never gotten it though, had I been aware that raisins were in my near future.  I attempted to talk KD into splitting that salad I spied with me and also sharing the ricotta gnocchi but she did not take the bait.  She informed the gnocchi is very good but she wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal.  I ordered the casa salad ($8) and KD ordered the pork belly($12). The pork belly was very fatty so I passed on having a bite.  My casa salad was dreadful.  I was super duper disappointed.  It had burnt grilled bread on top.  When this was pointed out to our server, she had another plate of grilled bread brought out to us.  The salad had a strong, unappealing flavor.  Perhaps it was simply an off night for the house salad?  I love salads and Fox restaurants have some amazing salads. This was not one of them. I love my Sam Fox restaurants as much as the next person but this one was not a highlight for me.",

I've been to the North in Kierland commons and this one definitely outdoes that location. The seating is gorgeous - very open and airy and I love the natural light. Seems like a cute spot for a date night or a girls dinner and drinks night. Their patio looks super cute but with it being deathly hot in Phoenix right now I'll have to wait to try it.   I ordered a chicken caesar salad which was good for a plain salad - I wasn't expecting much and was trying to stick to my healthy eating plan. My coworker ordered a pizza that I have literally been dreaming about ever since. It looked amazing - its currently on my must try list. Dessert was very good - ordered the salted caramel budino which was amazeballs - totally worth the extra time at the gym. Will definitely be returning when I can indulge a little bit more.",

I understand they make their own pasta, but the meat balls didn't seem like they were made in house, Why... well if you cook then you know you wouldnt include an artery in your meat balls would you? Yeah it completely ruined my appetite pulling an artery out of my half chewed mouthful of meat. Gross to say the least. I was hoping this place would be my new lunch spot however I wont be going back ever. The potatoes were amazing and the drinks were meh okay... I was surprised at the price of the food. Truly not worth what I paid...",

    "text": "I'm going to change my review. Haven't been here in a year or two.  Place is really nice and I will say the food is very very good. The Pig Pizza is top notch, and the tortellini is amazing.  However, the dining \"experience\" for me was lacking for the following reasons:  1.  Glasses tasted a little bit \"soapy\" (order your beer in a bottle);  2.  Whenever my wife and I were in an in-depth conversation, it seems we were interrupted with a question that didn't need to be asked.  When someone is enjoying a conversation, do what they do at Hillstone (let them talk, wait for the moment when they are not engaged in a conversation, then ask them if everything is okay).  Clearly everything is okay when a conversation is going.  Just one of those little details you will not find waiters and waitresses doing at Hillstone that we got here.    3.  At around 8:30 p.m. (while we were still eating) one gal came by and started sweeping the floor aggressively right next to our table.  I realize she wanted to get out of there, but we were still eating.  If you have ever seen anyone sweep a floor, you know particles go flying everywhere - not the type of \"seasoning\" I am looking for.  Love the place, but training the staff in the finer points of customer etiquette would increase your profits big time.  People who understand fine dining see these things and it impinges on the overall experience.  I am still a fan, so hopefully digest this in the spirit it is intended - to be helpful.",

Seriously, no exaggeration THE WHOLE DINNER was one hand swatting away flies and one hand trying to eat.  Evidently the little buggers can not resist steamed mussels. ( I will get to the food part of my review in a second)   Also, I am not a big fan of mandatory valet parking.   No wait, I am pretty sure I don't like mandatory ANYTHING when I go out to eat.   Not even the having to pay part, but I have come to accept this as normal now when dining out.     OK, on to the food.   I thought the food was AWESOME.  The aforementioned mussels were plump and cooked perfectly.  We had a wood-fired pizza with fresh dough that was yummy.   There is this thing called a Chef's Board that I highly recommend (If you are still bent on going in the first place) The dessert was a warm Nutella cake with vanilla gelato and coffee cream with bits of coffee bean in it. Now THAT was a delicious way to end a meal.   Our server was excellent as well.    Bottom line is: I am not going back and I am saddened by that since the food was so good and so was my server.",

I loved that we could watch them make the fresh pasta and bread from our table.   We stopped in for an early lunch on Labor Day, with our awesome Fox Restaurants 25% off coupon! Thank you!  We had hopped to get the brunch menu, but since it was Monday we had to go with the lunch menu, looked just as good tho, so no worries.   We had this yummy cheese and bread appetizer, you must try it! Then we shared the salami panini and the other girls had a meat lovers looking pizza. Pretty much everything was gone from our plates so I think it is safe to say we all enjoyed the food.   There is something for everyone here, nice bar, a TV to catch some sports, a nice patio facing the Arcadia neighborhood, and lots of space to push some tables together for a large party.   What impressed me the most.... we arrived at 10:45 a.m. (we were for some reason thinking we were doing brunch) 15 minutes prior to them opening... and we were seated right away, they didn't even mention that we were early and they weren't open yet. Business as usual. Very nice, thank you!",

    "text": "The dilapitated carwash-turned-trattoria is a cute concept and was executed well. Almost feels \"local\" except for the fact that it's a Fox concept restaurant and carries the same inauthentic atmosphere as the rest. They did a very nice job reonvating this space and gave it some great curb appeal. But it lacks the True Arcadia genuineness present at it's neighbors' establishments. It's in the food, it's in the people. It's not in NoRTH.  My experiences have been mixed. The first visit was very nice - just there for some small bites and wine. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were incredibly friendly. Food was slightly above mediocre though incredibly salty and oily. Second visit - not so nice. Called ahead to see if they allowed dogs. The hostess put me on hold to confirm and came back with a yes. When we arrived, we were met with a \"um, no.\" They (the manager) were a little (or a lot) snooty about it, so my third visit took a while to come around. Similar to the first with mediocre results.  The bar is beautious with friendly bartenders, so I haven't even bothered with waiting for a table. The front staff always seems a little annoyed that we're even walking in like \"I guess we can be bothered to seat you\" which is why we always just help ourselves to the bar. It's close to home with all day happy hour on Sundays (decent wine), so I'll probably be back eventually. But only if I'm eager to have one of those \"stumble home in a wine stupor\" nights.",

    "text": "The Arcadia neighborhood just keeps getting cooler. NoRTH is a Sam Fox restaurant whose concept is different from what you may be familiar with already from the north Scottsdale location.   Everything from the restaurant's decor (modeled after an Italian farmhouse) to the servers' uniforms (plaid shirts) to the menu (traditional Italian) is completely different from the NoRTH in Scottsdale. Our bartender told us this NoRTH is nicknamed \"NoRTH 40,\" and this new restaurant reflects where Fox is going with the brand, which already has five existing locations throughout the country.  The restaurant is open and airy, with one big, well-lit dining room with an open kitchen and exposed metal beams. The eatery had a good energy to it and was bustling with lots of conversation and alternative music playing in the background. There's a bar connecting the dining room to the patio, with the bar wrapping around the back of the restaurant and featuring television screens on either side. The patio has a picnic vibe to it, with tables set atop a dirt ground and a section of seats one level below the patio for lounging. The patio sort of reminded me of fellow Arcadia spot La Grande Orange's patio, but I didn't like the dirt flooring-it was too minimalist to me, and I felt like it could have been so much prettier, especially considering the high quality of the menu.  That was my general dilemma with NoRTH-while the vibe there is casual, the menu features handmade, downright fancy food-served to you by people who look like they just stepped out of Urban Outfitters. NoRTH was too busy to be considered romantic, but some menu items cost $20 or more, with the pastas and entree dishes ranging from $14-$26. I guess for the affluent people who inhabit the Arcadia neighborhood, NoRTH could be their casual dining destination, though I'm still trying to figure out what type of occasion I would return for dinner.  My favorite part about NoRTH was the food. I am not really into the whole plaid uniform thing (and that's exactly the type of style nearby Postino servers have been rocking long before), and there was nothing compelling about the atmosphere that stood out to me-and this is one patio I'd never request to sit on even though I always prefer to sit outside. That said, the food was delicious, and the cocktails were strong, though I thought the menu was better suited for a classier atmosphere.  Drinkwise, I had the Ducati ($9) a small but powerful drink made with Grappa, Hornitos Anejo Tequila, Solerno Blood Orange and agave. It tasted refreshing but strong, so I made my next Ducati tall with added soda water. If strong drinks aren't your thing, I highly recommend doing this, because the second drink was way better than the first but packed the same punch.  I also tried my companion's \"Old Roma\" ($9), made with Courvoisier, Cointreau, lemon and mint. This drink was even stronger than my original Ducati, but my pal said he loved it because he also found it refreshing.  He also got a Quiet Italian Gentleman ($10), with Bulleit Rye, Disaronno amaretto, Campari and Carpano Antiqua. This tasted like cough syrup to me, and I could barely take a sip, but he loved it. Just be warned-all their cocktails are amazingly strong and well worth the price for the amount of alcohol you get.  To begin the meal, we had a Grilled Portabella ($8), with arugula and shaved grana padano. This was a wonderful dish, with super-fresh greens and cheese that perfectly complemented the mushroom. It wasn't the most filling appetizer, but it was wonderfully made and tasted great.  For my entree, I got the Agnolotti ($15), pasta made with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and herb butter. I savored every bite of this pasta that was obviously handmade. I thought it was delicious, and it's great the restaurant had such high-quality ingredients and preparation.  My pal got the Mafaldine ($17), made with spicy rock shrimp, white wine, shaved fennel, tomato, garlic, chili and basil. His dish looked and smelled amazing.  It was hard to beat the tastiness of the main course, but our \"Affogato\" desserts ($6) did just that. Vanilla gelato was topped with coffee creme and served atop melted chocolate, and I loved every bit of it. This was the first time I've ever had a dessert like this, and it was so yummy.  While I probably wouldn't come back to NoRTH Arcadia for dinner because the ambiance just doesn't jive with the menu to me, I think it's a great lunch option if you're in the area. Their lunch menu includes sandwiches ranging between $9-$11 in addition to the dinner pastas offered, and I bet the restaurant is beautiful during the day because of how much sun comes in.",

You can spend a couple of hours here relaxing, eating and drinking while chatting with friends.   The best thing during happy hour is the board which consists a variety of things from prosciutto to jam to bread at a lower price. That will fill you up. I also had the personal pizza special for the day. Couldn't finish it because of all the food. The vanilla vodka drink was decent.   So either the board or the pizza will decently fill you up. And probably a mimosa will top off a good experience. About $15 for that during happy hour. Although I didn't mention it yet... The food is really delicious. :)",

I personally enjoy dining at this location in Arcadia. It's just a just short walk north of foodie paradise on 40th and Campbell. North Italia is a modern take on made-from-scratch traditional Italian dishes prepared daily with fresh, seasonal ingredients. My first experience here was an evening consisting of a bottle of wine and a chef board with a buddy of mine. They have a nice open patio bar area that has plenty of shade from the surrounding trees. The restaurant is very inviting and has a nice relaxed atmosphere to it. The Pig (with Italian sausage and San Marzano tomato sauce) and Bacon & Egg Pizza are some of the popular pizza selections. They also have a variety of wines and small plates (like the signature Prosciutto Bruschetta with Crescenza cheese and grilled asparagus- yum) to choose from. Just recently I tried their spaghetti & braised meatball plate. The pasta is thicker than most spaghetti noodles but nice and smooth. It's one of the best spaghetti dishes I've ever tried. I enjoyed watching the prep guys preparing some pasta for national pasta day. Service has always been great for me here as they really stress hospitality. If you love casual Italian food, this is a nice place to stop in for a little taste of Italy.",

I got the Italian farm salad with salmon added on and it was by far my new favorite salad! My husband had the eggplant parm sandwich and he loved it.

I was visiting from out of town and went to lunch with some girlfriends on a Friday afternoon. It helped that the weather was great, but they had all the doors open even though we were inside.   The vibe of the place is super cool and modern, yet homey. (See pics!) Our waitress was super helpful in recommending popular items and her favorites. She also was sweet to our friend (the Bride, getting married the next day) and made her feel special.   Their presentation was fun, all around. (See photo of mimosa.) I had an arugula and goat cheese pizza with buttery, savory crust. Also to die for: Their sweet and salty caramel dessert. My mouth is watering just thinking of it, but be warned: It is RICH. It looks small, but better to share.  I would love to visit again for an evening meal with friends or on a date. I loved the vibe and the menu, so you know it's a winner.",

We ordered the kids chicken cutlet and kids spaghetti, fig and prosciutto pizza, squid ink spicy seafood pasta, kale salad and meatballs.  Our group of 4 adults and 2 kids are plenty and very satisfied!! The real highlights of the meal honestly was the pasta dishes (even the kids spaghetti) and the pizza.  Pasta was al dente with great texture and flavor.  The spicy tomato based sauce for the squid ink pasta honestly wasn't too spicy but flavorful nonetheless, lots of garlic and onion.  The pizza was really good, had the right blend of the salty prosciutto/sweet fig/creamy goat cheese/peppery arugula.  The dough was thin and crispy but had enough chew to each bite.  Pleasant surprise, worth a try!",

Their pizza of the day today was a white pizza with bacon, fig & peperoncino peppers. To. Die. For. The perfect combination of sweet & spicy!   The best part, they have HH ALL DAY SUNDAY too!!! Also, for brunch, their chicken salad sandwich is phenomenal! Their pastas are all hand-made and you truly can't go wrong with any of them. Yum! It's safe to say that I'm a regular here.",

I made reservations for my birthday and even though we arrived on time, my boyfriend and I still had to wait 25+ minutes to be seated.. seemed to defeat the purpose of making a reservation in the first place. We ordered a salad, pizza, and pasta and put that order all in at once with our server. The salad and pizza came out but the pasta was no where to be found. Our waitress came back and asked how we liked everything but when we mentioned waiting on the pasta it was clear she forgot to put it in. Since it's an open kitchen and we were seated right next to it i could see the chaos unfold of her scrambling to smooth over her mistake before we noticed. The pasta came out 20 minutes later so we were sitting without food between the salad and pizza just waiting around getting sour about it. On top of that the waitress never took responsibility for her mistake. I assumed she would have at least comped the pasta since she messed up. The bad service made the good food unmemorable.",

The decor is rustic/chic yet modern, which works perfectly. It's a great place for a date, a birthday, anniversary, or just a fun night out. Our server was very attentive; we didn't have to wait for anything. It seemed like the moment the water or wine glass was near empty, he was right there to refill it. We told him it was our first time there and we got free zucchini chips! They were a little salty, but seriously addicting. My friend and I told the server that we were sharing the chicken parmesan and the spinach tortelloni. We were pleasantly surprised when the two dishes were served in half-size portions to each of us, so we didn't even half to split our meals. The food was AWESOME!! The pasta was fresh and the sauces and toppings were absolutely perfect. Flavorful, delicious, and amazing. I would highly recommend North and I cannot wait to go back!",

My photo booth company (The Memory Makers) was hired to take pictures at an 18th birthday celebration at another local restaurant. Due to rainy weather, the party needed to be moved to a location with more coverage on the patio to keep the guests (and photo booth equipment!) dry. Six hours before the birthday dinner was supposed to begin the mother of the birthday-girl contacted North to see if they could accommodate a party of about 30 teens on their patio that same evening. The fabulous folks at North made it happen! The set up was beautiful - you would have never known that it was a last minute scramble!! When I got there to set up the photo equipment we had to move a few tables around, find a rug to cover up a cord that would have been a tripping hazard for both guests of the restaurant and the servers, and a few other adjustments. The manager and the servers were so gracious and helpful in moving everything around to maximize the space for the photo booth. The guests at the party had an amazing time. Because I was working I did not have the opportunity to eat but based on the other reviews of North on Yelp, I will definitely be back! Thank you, North!",

You can see them working on your pasta, cutting fresh prosciutto and they have all this freshly baked bread on display (make sure you buy a loaf to go- We did it and had some pesto mozzarella sandwiches at home... Delicious!).  The food's really good and I believe it's priced accordingly to its quality. We were there for brunch on Sunday and everyone enjoyed their meal. We were a big group also so we got to try all kinds of different food but their pizza seems to be the queen (or at least for our table it was!).  Make sure you bring some cash to tip the valet parking guys. There's no parking on the street but their valet parking's free (you just tip and that's it). I'm not a fan of valet parking myself but I understand some people like the convenience/feeling spoiled by having someone else bring your car for you to the door, specially when eating at a nice place like this.  It's a cute place for a date or an anniversary or just because. The food's delicious so just go anytime!",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place a 5 star review, but I can't. The truth is I never ate here. One of my customers spoke highly of North. As I do every Monday evening, I try a restaurant that is new to me. The young lady told me she would be expecting Monday evening anytime after 6pm. Great, see you there, I told her. I arrived a bit after 7pm. I was greeted by a very nice young man. This young man is one of their Valet's. Um... right, I don't do valet. I'll just self park. To which he replied, \"There is no self park, we only do valet, 7 days a week and right now the parking lot is full.\"   From a business perspective, a full parking lot is fantastic. On a Monday night to be full is certainly a testimony of how popular this restaurant is. However, from a guest perspective, this is not good. I then told the young man, I would just park next door or across the street. He then warned me that my car would be towed. Great! Since my car is my livelihood, I can't afford that, so what's my solution? I find the local McDonalds and have a $2.50 double cheese burger and well done fries, because at this point I'm pretty pissed. I moved here from California. If your parking lot hasn't enough parking, typically your establishment works a deal with the neighboring businesses for your overflow. Especially when their businesses doesn't operate in the evening. I'm not sure If I'll be back.",

The service today was the worst I've ever experienced, including dirty wine glasses with a ten minute wait for a new glass, a forgotten appetizer as well as the wrong entree. By the time we were able to flag down our server it then took about another 20 minutes to get the correct order. I was compensated for the entree, however expect much more from a Sam Fox restaurant. Even a proper apology would have gone a long way here. North is a great restaurant and hope that they can clean up their service to rise up to their reputation.",

I always respect an Italian restaurant that gives aranchinis a try. These were very good for an American restaurant. Still on the look out for an authentic style one... The entire menu seems like a scientific slight american modification of traditional Italian dishes. They were well prepared, but left me wanting the real thing.

There is a quaint bar up near the front and a patio as well.    They offer fantastic happy hours with $5 wines, beers and such and they also offer a variety of small plates as well . I'm a fan of the chef's board.  This consists of several cheeses, salami's, proscuitto, a jam, various breads, olives.  For $10? What a steal.  The chips are fresh and homemade as well and they are sinfully delicious.  I\"ve only gone for happy hours and it can be full. Not overpowering full like Postino's , but not empty at all.

Well! the manager, Chris contacted us personally and made it right. Chris tells us he is the manager but with his dedication to his customers and this restaurant I would think he is the owner. I honestly believe our experience was a one time mistake that North Italia corrected immediately. They are even changing their take out containers to make sure the quality of their delectable food is protected on its trip to your home's table. I am extremely impressed with North Italia and I am highly recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for an incredibly delicious meal and the best service you will ever have. Thank you Chris, we will see you soon.    -----  This 2 stars is for their take out only. We are very unhappy! We love North and we eat there whenever we can. It is normally delicious. Tonight we ordered take out and it was horrible. Not only are their take out containers made of paper and soak up all the sauce but they completely ignored our order. When we finally got someone to check on our order it had been sitting on their counter for 10 minutes. We spent $65.00 for ice cold dinners that were terrible. We are very upset by the lack of concern the restaurant staff had towards their take out customers.",

    "text": "Last night after landing back in Phoenix after a week of traveling under my belt/wings again, my boyfriend took me for dinner at North Italia in Arcadia. I have had this FRC place on my 'must try soon' list for some time. I had to dodge in after our car was valeted, (complimentary, btw), and get out of my poly/wool/mostly poly tho uniform that would def show who I work for and what I do when I work; yeah. That's always good for some looks. Girl with wings on on a Saturday dodging right into a restaurants restroom for a quick change and hair down so she can have the much needed drink after flying all week! So 3 minutes later I am a new looking girl and we were promptly seated. Our table was 'European style' seating: small table for two next to other twos near the open Italian kitchen. Our waiter was on it and right there to take our orders, but my boyfriend let him know we needed a few minutes to collect ourselves and do a quick catch up. He was sweet and said that since we had our drinks, a pitcher of the red sangria my boyfriend had stocked us with while waiting at the bar for my quick-change and our table, he would check with us in a few minutes and that there was no rush. That is nice because how often are you seated and felt rushed to order?! Our red sangria was just sweet enough and yet not too sweet made with blood orange and brandy to cut too much 'sweet' out. We decided on ordering a few small plates for nibbling with our sangria. We ordered the combo of charcuterie of meats and cheeses and seasonal roasted veggies. It also came with a great sweet/tart chutney that paired nicely with the fresh mozzerella and spicy salami. The bread, which is house made, and one of things you can see in the open kitchen concept, was toasted and amazing. That could have been my entire dinner, happily! We also shared the roasted artichoke that comes with a alioli for dipping. Just enough garlic and tad of parmesan cheese and roasted nicely. Our favorite small plate tho was the Fonduta. Rich melted, warm Italian cheese served in a black iron pan and topped with a sweet tomato jam for dipping more toasted bread in. We were full after sharing these small plates. The menu is very vast: PIzzas,homemade pastas, meats and seafoods to pair with a nice wine/local beer list and several housemade cocktails with a Italian spin on most. We stayed and moved over to the bar because we liked the ambience and vibe of North so much. We had another wine and our friends joined us. We ALMOST had dessert because that menu also looked so tempting. This place is another FRC great. The patio looked amazing with a huge fireplace that had a roaring fire; outdoor seating to the bar; clean restrooms and cool decor. That coupled with a great menu and vibe and fresh made entrees all make for a great place! Oh. There is also, The Rocket. North's 'food truck' that does private events. We asked about it as it drove into the North parking lot. Apparently it has a brick oven on board! NOW, I am wondering what I can book and use The Rocket for! Cool idea! Thanks for the great night, North!",

    "text": "I was here last night for a late night bite and it was pretty close to perfect. Our waiter suggested the perfect Malbec and it was wonderful. We shared the chefs board and it was delicious. The prosciutto was perfect. We also got the bambolinis and the affogato. Both were fantastic ways to finish the night! I would 100% recommend this location. The only issue that I ran into was that the hours said that the restaurant would be closed at 11, and at around 9:30 there was only one other group of customers and we felt rushed to eat and settle our tab. It seemed that the staff wanted to leave early so they decided to bring us the check before we had finished our meal. I found that a bit rude and don't particularly enjoy being rushed. The service and food were great aside from that point.",

I don't remember what everyone ordered but I remember sharing the calamari dish and the cheese,meat and veggie chef  board and they were great we could not get enough. For my entree I ordered the the Riccota Gnocchi with braised short ribs, the Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and the braised short ribs melted in your mouth. A lot of us shared our entrees with others and I got to try the bolognese with fresh pasta and there is nothing like eating fresh pasta, I also tried the fig and  prosciutto  pie and that was awesome (besides the goat cheese I do not like goat cheese. Don't judge me). I ended my night with the Bombolini , I also shared these with others and loved them along with tasting the salted caramel budino. next time I go back I am set on getting the bolognese and the Salted caramel budino. I def suggest going here the service was on point also.",

    "text": "Had our first dinner at NoRTH last night. I'm sure it won't be our last.   Pros- Within walking distance from home. We didn't have to worry about parking, but I understand that is an issue for some. By now this should be expected for the 40th and Camelback establishments. This area was not always zoned for restaurants, so plan accordingly.  The building is beautiful. Very welcoming, open, modern, rustic chic. I feel that they captured the essence of what this kind of dining should be. You are all enjoying good food and good company in one large room. Kind of like a really beautiful wedding reception somewhere in wine country.   THE SERVICE. I know that you can have great and horrible service in any restaurant at any time. It depends on the server. Our server, Michael (slim, blonde hair), was perfect. He was attentive, friendly, informative (without seeming to be giving a scripted run down) Mediocre service is so prevalent, and I hope that his managers know what an asset they have in him. He even offered to explain any menu items that may be unfamiliar in a way that seemed helpful instead of demeaning.  Tables are in very close proximity to each other. Like most people, I am normally not a fan of this. Surprisingly, for whatever reason, this didn't bother me during my visit. The atmosphere is so convivial and relaxed that I actually didn't mind having others so close.  Cons- I have no real cons. Anything I could offer here would be mere suggestions. As has been the case for most FOX restaurants I have visited, the food is consistently interesting and good. I continue to frequent these places for the atmosphere, service, and good food. I have yet to find anything on their menus that I crave or remember for months following, but I do always know that I will have an enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "I hate to  give 2 stars...however, I know i must be honest in my experience and 2 stars portrays it's perfectly.  I had high hopes for this place considering all the wonderful reviews, but I was not a satisfied customer this Sunday during their brunch. This is only a review on brunch.    Service:  Mixed reviews.  First off, we walked into a 1/3 of a full restaurant with plenty of seating and prepared tables but were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  WHAT???  Why not seat us and at least give waiting patrons drinks.  We figured it was short staffed and thought we would just grab a coffee at the bar that had 3 servers behind it and less than half the seats filled.  Apparently that was not going to happen smoothly.  The bartender didn't acknowledge us and when she did decide to help a customer it was one that came after us.  Already, a bad taste in my mouth.  Once she deiced to ask what we needed (a simple request for coffee), she asked her two colleagues to take care of it who then mumbled under their breath that they didn't wish to.  Possibly it was dissension between the three of them, but why make the customer aware of it.  In the end, we got seated before the three of them could decide who was in charge there.  Our server at the table was great and he made up for our first 2 awful experiences.  He was upbeat and knowledgeable.  Thank goodness.  Food:  Maybe I'm becoming a food snob, but North does not seem to have authentically made food.  It taste loaded with fat, salt and sugar.   I ordered something simple...Irish Oats with Apples with a side of scrabbled eggs and garlic toast.  The Irish Oats were very sweet but I will say I did love the whipped maple brown sugar mouse but realized they forgot to add the apples.. no big deal.  I just asked the waiter about it and very sweetly offered to bring me a side of them.  He then brought me another bowl of the oats which he didn't have to do so I thought it was a kind gesture.  However, as in the first bowl it was missing another ingredient..the candied pecans.  Somehow one ingredient goes missing.  :)  No harm, no foul, but just odd.  In addition, neither bowl was hot.  The second issue were with my eggs.  How can you mess up scrambled eggs??  The were LOADED with salt.  I assume it has to be an error since most restaurants let you salt your own eggs.  These salty eggs were certainly inedible. On the plus side, their garlic toast was pretty tasty.    I don't think I'll be back to North.  If I do return it will be to try their dinner menu and of course if I have a better experience I'll update this review.  Their breakfast and their service I will choose to pass on.",

We started with a bottle of wine, Barbera. It came uncorked which I found strange.  Waiter said bartender opened. Maybe my restaurant friends can tell me if this is normal or not? Back to the food.. We ordered the calarami. It was alright. It's a litte too crispy and you really can't taste to calamari at all. I had the Strozzapretti as my meal. It was delicious and not too rich. There was also plenty of grilled chicken in the dish so the pasta didn't feel overwhelming. My husband had the Spinach Tortelloni. He loved it but it is very rich! I tasted it and thought it was great as well. We both agreed the Strozzapretti was the better of the two. Parking is mostly vallet unless you park across the street. Overall great experience!",

Went for lunch with some girlfriends I hadn't seen in ages so we wanted a place where we could hang out and enjoy some fine foods and laughs.  It was two vegetarians and 2 non vegers.  The server wasn't sure about which dishes were  vegetarian which made one of my friends a little unsure still whether her dish had chicken stock in it.  We ordered a couple drinks and food that we all shared.  I wasn't a huge fan of my Malbec in a water glass, but the wine itself was nice and inexpensive ($7)   We got the pizza that had brussels sprouts, onions, nuts, and sweet potato that was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever had (and I have had A LOT of pizza). All the flavors blended perfectly while maintaining their own individual deliciousness.   We also got the pesto tortellini that was also pretty amazing.  It was cool to watch the kitchen crew making the pasta out in the open too.    There was another pasta with red sauce that was good and a chicken sandwich that was also  good, but not overly memorable.   The restaurant is nice open air, with a very relaxed atmosphere that doesn't make you feel you need to rush.   Comp valet was a nice touch to the meal.",

    "text": "We always enjoy Sam Fox restaurants and North Italia was no exception.  We visited on a very busy Labor Day evening but no less than two different managers, the bartender and three servers checked on us through the evening to make sure we were receiving attentive service.  Branzino and mussels are two of our favorite dishes that we tend to order whenever we see them on the menu, and the dishes from North Italia were two of the best we've ever had.  Alexander gave us great wine recommendations so I stopped by the front desk on the way out to thank him.  He was on the phone at the time and even apologized when he hung up because he couldn't talk to me the minute I showed up!  The managers were hustling just as hard as the servers.   Love this place.",

    "text": "This evening my other half and I returned to North in Arcadia. I had spoken with Chris, the manager about my experience and since he was eager for us to return and my Hubs was willing to try another meal here ,we came in. We were seated promptly. Inside for this occasion and I wasn't disappointed. Why? Because we were close to the kitchen and I could see them actually slicing meat for the Board appetizers as well as fresh pasta being assembled for cooking. There was a hand pasta roller so I can only assume I missed them actually making the noodles :(  The Zucca chips.. AWESOME! My hubs actually told me that this would be the only time he enjoyed eating a vegetable. Ok, so they are fried  but oh so delicious! Mm mm... Mmmmmm. I decided to try the Margherita pizza since  I sawit being served  the last time we were here and salad. I did not regret it!  It was wood fired and had some \"burned\" spots but that is what I LOVE! Just ask my man and he will tell you that when he's ready to throw out the burned BBQ I demand it. Sorry,but that is the best part and so it was here. Although that wasn't really burned pizza, it was the tastiest part. :) And the Hubs? He ordered the Rosemary chicken that included roasted vegetables and au jus. He was absolutely delighted with his selection (ok, minus the veggies. Ask and you will be told they are against his religion. LOL).  His only wish was for more au jus. I tried  a piece of the charred broccoli and for me, perfection! I love charred food . So much so that  I might ask for these next time we visit. Chris even stopped by to see how we were enjoying ourselves and we appreciated it. Will we be back? I think so.  Parking is easy since there is complimentary valet parking. The indoor seating was fine.  We've been on the patio and would probably ask for a location near the windows or the shrubbery since the corner seating was a bit noisy for the Mister . The bar looks fun. There was a few people that rode in on bicycles and were seated there. From what I saw they were having a grand ol' time. Service was fast,food was hot and drinks were cold.",

It had a unique flavor and texture that was delicious and not too sweet.   The main reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is due to the restaurant being so warm. They need to add some fans or turn up the air conditioning. I'm someone who is typically cold in restaurants, so for me to be warm, I can only imagine how everyone else was feeling. Definitely worth trying and we would come again, but maybe when it's cooler outside n ;)",

We drank iced teas and ate the grilled artichokes before their salads and my pizza arrived. Good artichoke with good fresh and tangy cheese on top and a rich lemony dipping sauce. I love artichokes and grilling them is a top-2 method of preparing them (frying in olive oil being the other). I wouldn't serve the inedible parts of an artichoke to my guests at home, however, and they left the woody parts on this one. *Poor bastard who never had an artichoke before still trying to chew the tough ass outer leaves on his...  Salads look bright and tasty with greens and cold cuts and served on a cutting board.   My pizza is called \"the Pig\" and I thank them for naming this one after me. It had sausage, salami, and soppressata with mozzarella and tomato sauce and it was just what I wanted. Thin crust in the middle, thick at the edges and a little char on it. It was actually larger than I thought it would be so I had to take half of it home to enjoy it another day.  Service was attentive without being overly affectionate and as we were finishing our meal, we got to view some tortellini being hand made in the open kitchen.  Should I tip the valet again?",

I really love the chicken pesto and the chicken parmigiana, both have fresh sauces with homemade pasta. Service has been very good, as well as friendly. They have a fantastic all day happy hour on Sunday with discounted food and 1/2 price bottles of wine. They also have a delicious weekend brunch. The baked french toast is amazing, and they offer a cool twist on the Bloody Mary called the Red Rooster. I'm glad I gave North a second chance.",

For the six of us, we ordered the Happy Hour Bottle and Board, Steamed Muscles, Fonduta, Beet Salad, Tuscan Basil Tomato Soup (2), a side of pasta, Spaghetti and the daily Pizza. We also added a glass of Malbec Red Wine and two cokes for $114. Only $19 per person including apps and drinks. Good deal there.   The charcuterie board was excellent. It had salami, spicy pepperoni, two cheeses, garlicky olives, candied apricot bits, asparagus, bread and some tasty nuts.   For the meals, everyone enjoyed their plate. Mine was the pizza - a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, pepperoni and basil. It was the first white pizza I'd had in 20 years. Excellent pie.   The service is definitely worth mentioning: Melissa gave us the perfect amount of attention, made menu suggestions, had good rapport with her customers and a charming smile. She made our meal better!  We will be returning, with more guests!",

    "text": "Tis the season for Holiday Festivities.  I started my holiday season with hosting a White Elephant Brunch for 14 people at North Italia.  Oh, what a good time!  It was a first time visit for everyone.  I made the reservation for my group about 1 month prior and followed up about a week before to confirm our final number.  Management, the host staff and server, Robert, were all so accommodating.  We visited North Italia this past Sunday ... Sunday Funday ... Happy Hour all day baby!  Happy Hour includes $5 Red Sangrias, $6 Mimosas and Bellinis, Half off Bottles of Wine, $20 Board and Bottles.  Can't beat it!  Majority of us stuck with Red Sangrias and Mimosas.  The Dirty Almond Chai was also a winner.  Everyone ordered different items ranging from Short Rib Hash, Veggie Scrambles, Breakfast Wrap, Nonna Casserole, Americano, Mussels, Strozzapreti and Lemon Donuts.    I must be honest here .... We thoroughly enjoyed the taste of every single dish, everything was season and cooked to perfection.  However, a few dishes came out cold, everything else was lukewarm.  Nothing came out hot except for the Nonna Casserole (which was my favorite dish by the way).  We were starving so we chowed down.  Everyone mentioned their food wasn't that warm but one person absolutely had to send her dish back ... the veggie scramble.  You can't enjoy cold eggs.  Robert was so on point!  She told him the food was too cold to enjoy, he took it back and brought a fresh, steaming hot, delicious veggie scramble in no time.  Also, the mussels were a little disappointing.  Although they had a nice flavor, majority of them were empty or really small.  My friend ordered them and told me to dig in.  I took about 4.  Three of them were empty ... seriously, so I only tried one.  They were pretty small too.  The manager was kind enough to take them off her final bill.  A few of us ordered the short rib hash, again, the flavor was out of this world good but the serving size was small.  There may have been 3 small pieces of short rib on top of crispy potatoes with 2 fried (runny) eggs and grilled bread.  This is important to note because everyone ordered an extra side of crispy potatoes because the menu didn't say the short rib hash comes with potatoes.  Be sure to specify how you'd like your eggs cooked because they come fried very light and runny.  It's definitely not your ordinary short rib hash.   I hope the pictures illustrate how much of a good time we had because we did.  We're planning to try them again soon for Happy Hour.",

We chose this restaurant as the pre marathon meal, and had some appetizers and entrees. No drinks involved.   For appetizers- they do give bread and oil, however PRO TIP- get the truffle garlic bread. It's immaculate. You won't be disappointed. Trust me. Do it. And take that extra bread and put that ricotta on it. Amazing. I want this all the time.   entrees- I chose the strazapetti, changed the sauce for just oil (Marathon the next morning, keeping it simple) and it was still delicious. You can tell the pasta is fresh and made on premise. A great ratio of chicken and spinach to pasta as well.    Others got the chicken parm, pasta bolognese and marg pizza and I didn't hear one complaint, everyone was a part of the clean plate club. I'd say that's some positive reinforcement.   I'm not positive if this is normal, but I would make reservations. It was pretty packed for a Saturday evening.",

Service was great, the waiting staff is very accommodating, nice and professional The food is phenomenal I really enjoy coming here every time for dinner or for lunch. Love this place. The plus of this place is that you can use Open table app for a reservation as well as the app here for the reservation. Try the Mafaldine pasta and the Arancini Risotto Balls, they are one of a kind. Let me also say that they are the only place in town that know how to make a real Prosciutto pizza  and add the freshly sliced Prosciutto after they cook the pizza. This place is highly recommended and those are some of the reasons for the recommendation.",

The boards are full of wonderful delights and we have yet to try anything that we did not like. The wait staff is very happy helpful and efficient. Use the valet parking because the parking is minimal and when valeting they get you in and out fast. Seating is great inside or out. They have wonderful misters and heaters to help when seating out on the patio one of our favorite areas or inside has wonderful views of the great looking bar and modern decor. Good place to met for a date with your wife for happy hour or romantic night on the town. Dress can be casual or up scale it all depends on you. Fun place great food and a place one would want to return to.",

The scallops were cooked just right and the risotto and asparagus was mouth-watering!  My husband had the bolognese which he said was good but just a little plain, nothing spectacular.  My daughter ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and although the meatballs were great, the spaghetti sauce was overpowering with too much tomato flavor.  Wonderful service and great prices on the beer and wine during happy hour!",

The ambiance of the place was awesome -- if the weather is nice I would definitely recommend sitting outside.

Waiter appeared fairly quickly and explained the restaurant week menu items.  Received our appetizers within 7 minutes.  An additional hour plus to receive our entrees.  After 45 minutes an excuse was made that there was miscommunication in the kitchen. 20 minutes later the same excuse.  Finally served an hour and 15 minutes after we ordered.  Ate some of it.

The food, well, was well prepared and thoughtfully presented. Our party of 4 tried two appetizers: the mussels, which were excellent, and the grilled cauliflower, also wonderful. We also tried the seasonal vegetable salad, and it was very tasty. For our entrees, we tried rosemary chicken, the salmon, the sea bass, and the mushroom pasta. All very solid. Thank you guys.

We tried the zucca chips which are good but I probably won't get them next time. We split a Caesar salad to start. It was good, but seemed a little small for the price and could have used more croutons. If you don't care for fish you might not like it because we could taste anchovies in the dressing (which is supposed to be there).   My husband got the squid ink pasta. He said it was ok but he wouldn't get it again. He thought it was very heavy on the pepper and too spicy as a result. My dinner was the star of the show! I got the short rib radiatori and it was out of this world amazing!!! I don't think I would have tried it but I saw a couple of yelp reviews that recommended it, so I gave it a try and it did not disappoint! It's in this delicious, creamy sauce with bread crumbs on top to add a little crunch, but the short rib just falls apart and is so melt in your mouth amazing! I'm craving it already today. I will be back for that. I only wish we had bread to go with it. I'd also like to try a desert because they had some delicious sounding options but we didn't really have time for it.   Overall, a solid choice. Try the SHORT RIB RADIATORI!",

    "text": "I haven't been to North in years, but it was definitely always one of my favorite Fox concept restaurants in Tucson.  We finally decided to go to this one a couple of weeks ago, and unfortunately didn't think to plan ahead and arrived to a 1+ hour wait. We decided not to stay that time but yesterday we made a reservation and headed out.  We got there just in time to grab a couple of beers and tomato bruschetta on happy hour which ends at 6PM.  The beers were disappointing because it was $4 for a 12oz can (nothing on draft), but they can't be blamed as wine is their main game.  The bruschetta was delightful!  Two different types of tomato; the usual slice paired beautifully with the tomato puree which tasted very jammy.  The cheese was a spread instead of the usual mozzarella but I was HERE for it (I'm thinking it was marscapone) since it balanced the jam-like tomato puree.  Unfortunately they were out of the Bolognese, but that just gives us an excuse to go back again.  Instead of that, my husband got the spaghetti and meatballs, my son got kids spaghetti, and I grabbed the chicken parm. The spaghetti noodles were thick and perfectly cooked and they don't drown them in the sauce which I appreciate.  The sauce was extremely fresh and not too salty and the meatballs were perfectly cooked with a hint of crisp on the outside and moist inside.  My chicken parmigiana was COVERED in cheese and perfectly cooked but could have used a bit more garlic (personal preference). They had fresh Parmesan if you needed/wanted it and service was  fast and incredibly friendly.  I would definitely go back but it is rather pricey so maybe try to catch happy hour or go for brunch on the weekends (they do a bottle and board combo for $20 I think).  Don't forget cash for the complementary valet! That's the only parking they have!!",

Our server was really friendly and helpful, and made sure to get our drink orders on happy hour when there wasn't much time left, which I always think is nice.   I didn't pay much attention to the wine and cocktail list, but they have a really great selection of beer --lots of local choices. For an appetizer we got the calamari, which they pair with arugula. We thought that was interesting since we've never seen it before, but it was great! I definitely recommend trying it.  For dinner we got The Pig pizza, and it was delicious. I would say I've had other pizza I liked more, but my boyfriend thought it was great. Maybe next time I'll try asking for less soppressata because it was really salty, but that's just me :)   The dessert looks amazing too, we'll definitely come back to try it sometime!",

We also split the chicken pesto pasta with pine nuts and capers, that was amazing! I also recommend their tiramisu, which comes with delicious little chocolate balls on top.

It was also a fine place to take a child as we had our 2 year old with us.   They did us the courtesy of bringing out out daughter's cheese pizza first to get her settled in prior to our meals arriving.  When her pizza arrived, I was envious. I really wanted a slice!  I did steal a taste and found the sauce and cheese to be way above average for Phoenix. The dough was on par with wood fired pizza dough, which I find a little less rich than the Boston style pizza I prefer.  My wife ordered the pesto chicken and I ordered the chicken Parmesan. I tasted my wife's and found the sting fresh basil to be top notch.  To put it plainly, my meal was perfect. The flavor was wonderful, ingredients of high quality, and portions were right in for a meal.   Fox restaurants have yet to let me down. Don't miss this place. You will not be sorry.",

If you haven't tried their happy hours, you're missing out- especially on Sunday =  ALL DAY!   To start things off, I had the phenomenal cinnamon roll (only 3 bucks!) paired with their delicious coffee served in their adorable red mugs. The roll is big enough for sharing, but you probably won't want to. I took the rest of mine home to enjoy with my coffee the next day. :)   Next, I enjoyed a few mimosas and their HH pizza of the day (only 8 bucks!). The pizza that day had pepperoni, tomatoes, zucchini, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic. The dough was very fresh and it's just right - not too thick & not too thin. This is definitely enough for sharing as well. Also, they have a great deal on Sunday- a pizza and bottle of wine = $20!   Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is spot on. This place is pretty spacious so the wait is never really long AND if there is no outside seating, sitting inside is just as nice. The restaurant is open with lots of natural light and fresh air. PLUS, the service is great!   We'll definitely be back again and I'm looking forward! Thanks North, Arcadia!",

My server was very patient and helpful in offering his thoughts and what he thought I would enjoy. And my salad was absolutely the best salad I'd ever had in my life?! It was a roasted vegetable salad. So so good. I'd go back just for that salad. Next I had the mushroom tortellini. Very good. And I'm a picky girl when it comes to tortellini. Very small dish however. I only got maybe 8 tortellinis. But it's okay because I had also ordered the arancini which was very good and I loved how they were smothered in marinara sauce. Lastly I cannot remember the name of this cocktail but it was the wine mixed cocktail and was very good. The Ambiance of this restaurant was what I would've hoped for from the outside. Very vibey and lax but so appealing to the younger classier crowd I would say. Also they offer valet. Will definitely go back and this time maybe sit at their beautifully set up bar. One of my favorite fox concepts restaurants by far!!",

Okay now let's skip the small talk and get to the food....zucca chips are a MUST every time you visit here especially if they are on happy hour. I have tried a few other appetizers like the arancini and garlic bread and they were both amazing. For entrees, the short rib pappardelle is incredible. I'm not a fan of horseradish so I order it without the horseradish topping and it's amazing. Also, they have a really good bolognese too. Desserts here are also pretty top notch.

This most recent visit, I was excited to have their arancini. The crisp rice balls with marinara sauce aren't a typical item on a lot of Phoenix's Italian restaurants. They were warm and crispy. For an entree, I had the stozzapreti with parmesan cream sauce, chicken and mushrooms. I went to Italy a couple months ago and spent more than a week there. I'm no expert but the food at North tasted pretty authentic. I also like that they have zucca (zucchini) chips, which are thin and fried. You can snack and snack on them but they don't have the same filler-effect as bread or potato chips.   The ambience, like most Sam Fox restaurants, feels modern and warm. You can pretty much see people with their grandparents or their hipster friends here. I look forward to bringing a dog to try out their patio when the weather cools down.",

Kale salad was great though as well as the sangria but my family probably won't be back for a while after that. Hopefully they get things together!",

Had a wonderful dinner and couldnt resist but to share my experience. This place has incredible service surrounded by a perfect balance of home cooking and a beautiful night out on the town. Its very reasonably priced in my opinion and I haveny had anything on the menu that I havent liked. Althought the bolognese is the best.   Danielle is our favorite server and if youre going anytime soon, try their Apple Bourbon cocktail for a perfect balance of fall and winter.   You guys rock. See you again soon!",

That said, I've pretty much only been here for special occasions or happy hour (because of price). The Zucca Chips, Tuscan Kale Salad and Salted Caramel Budino are all winners in my book!",

    "text": "North is by far one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Every year I have my birthday dinner here and love bringing new people in to experience the amazing food! The ambiance at North in Arcadia is more relaxed than its sister location at Kierland with a charming and rustic barn feel. It's a great place for couples, groups or meeting your girlfriends for drinks.   As for the food, I would recommend starting with a bowl of their Zucca Chips or the Arancini (fried mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese and served with red sauce). If these don't get your appetite going then I don't know what else will!  For an entree my favorite dish is the Ricotta Gnocchi (braised beef short rib, horseradish crema and wilted arugula)...yumm! The Fall Lasagna is also a great go to dish however keep in mind that this is a seasonal item. I would highly suggest saving room for dessert as their Affogato is not only super delicious (vanilla gelato and espresso) but the presentation is fun as well.    North is a must try if you've never been.  Once you go I'm sure you'll become a regular whenever the mood for great Italian food, drinks with the ladies or date night hits you!",

There are hundreds of streets that start with North.\" Despite my lack of inherent navigational guidance I found my way there.   Dinner was a joy with a large group of people. I enjoyed the spinach pasta. Absolutely no feeling of guilt as it was so heavenly. I *did* regret missing Happy Hour. (It runs until 6pm. Wine is $4 a glass! Sangria and beer too!) I loved the ambiance and the incredible space. It was perfectly loud for new friends to have a good time. With gusto!  Fast forward to breakfast and I fell in love with the \"Short Rib Hash\". Eggs are involved. (Mom was doing it wrong all these years.) I forked my way through a gluttonous serving. Then I hoover'd down my neighbor's french toast. (The joys of communal eating.) The Red Rooster drink had just the kick of spice. I might have had two. (Shhh!)  Tonight I enjoyed a True Happy Hour. Vanessa at the bar is just *wonderful*. Full of energy she worked the bar. By that I mean she sprinkled her magic fairy dust and created smiles. (I didn't want to leave! Neither did any of my bar stool neighbors:) Hearing how much I enjoyed dark beers Vanessa offered  a Moretti by La Rossa.   Vanessa is amazing at what she does. North Italia provides excellent fare. Be sure to sample the pizzas! I had the special of the day. The crust is right up there with New York style crisp. Heaven. (And a steal at $8!)  Save me a bar stool during HH. (Two can share a bottle of wine *and* pizza for $20!) I can't wait to go again!",

For my meal, I had an italian salad with Sopressetta and added chicken. The dressing was light and refreshing and the flavor combination was amazing. I love that it was served on a board like the Charcuteri platters.   Our server was great. She even showed us how eat the artichoke properly. She kept our drinks full, was attentive and answered all my questions. I loved watching the kitchen prepare all the food, and the atmosphere is great, nice and open and bright.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how bright it was from natural light (tons of windows) and how modern the decor looked.  I also thought it was cool that I could watch the employees make fresh pasta by hand while I waited for my food.  I had the Zucca Chips and Fall Salad (added chicken to it) and both were awesome.  The chips were nicely browned and had a good crunch and weren't overly oily or dry.  The Fall Salad was amazing.  It was topped with literally some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had--cooked and seasoned to perfection, and juicy.  The salad was incredibly fresh and the mix of ingredients sounded a bit odd at first, but tasted wonderful together.  Perfect amount of dressing, too.  The portion sizes were definitely adequate and I left feeling full.  I think the best part of the whole dining experience was the service from my waitress and another waiter.  My waitress was very attentive and super friendly.  A different waiter ran some of my food and refilled my drink a few times, and he was also very pleasant and smiling all the time.  Some of the other employees (namely servers and hostesses) seemed a bit bored, snobbish, or unhappy at times, but all of the people I interacted with were friendly.  While the food was a bit pricey for what I normally spend, I would definitely come back to NoRTH if I was looking for higher quality food in a restaurant with good ambiance and great service.",

Wife was starving and they were able to quickly get our fried chickpeas out to us. Nice choice of craft beers. My tagliatelle bolognese was solid, but no more than that. Her Funghi pizza was, too.

Average lunch for one with an ice tea will run you $30.  Waiter was nice, knowledgable and friendly. Love the open kitchen concept. Live music from 11am to 1pm on Saturday. Also a brunch menu.  I ordered a pizza and the Zuchinni chips. Very tasty!      The one and only and HUGE downfall is the infestation of FLIES!!!!!!!  It really made our entire lunch unenjoyable!   When we complained to the waiter about the flies, he commented by saying, \"Yeah, everybody has been complaining about that\" then he went on to say how this year flies are supposed to be the worst ever in history.  So, should I take that as a hint, that of I eat here again I will have to share my food with the fly family ??!!!!     There are too many great places I can eat in this area that I don't need to deal with swooshing flies off of my food every three seconds! So unappetizing and it can't be sanitary especially with the open kitchen concept and the fact that veggies were stacked in open bins on the prep table and bread was stacked in the open air.  Hopefully I won't be picking baby bot flies out of my neck in a few months.   I don't think I will be back.  It is a shame because everything else was great.

In spite of this being part of the Foxian empire, we were drawn to this place because of the wonderful Luis Millan,  His culinary chops are well documented and he could not have been a more gracious presence to our first visit here.The arancini and a chef's board of of sliced meats and cheese (with a wonderful apricot mostardo) began the meal and whetted the appetite. I had the heirloom beet salad and Peg the seasonal vegetable salad...the freshness permeated the dishes and the wonderful textural notes were wonderful. Moving to the mains, the chicken and prosciutto and spicy shrimp pasta dishes were wonderfully flavorful and not over spiced. A layered nutella, banana, dark chocolate, and hazelnut/plum combination  dessert was very satisfying. Our server was Kim.  The face of the house and the conduit to a wonderful experience is always the wait staff IMO...and she is superb. She is vigilant without hovering, and making sure all was well. I would strongly suggest that you try this place...but if your schedule permits...try the place as close to opening (4:00 pm) on a Saturday as you can make it.  We arrived at 4:30ish...and by 6 the place was almost booked. The atmosphere was wonderful, and in the relative quiet of the earlier hour..you can appreciate the commitment that this place has for its decor and customers.  Chain or no, individuals make the experience...and this experience was delightful.  Dr, B",

While I admire the man's business acumen (build in trendy areas, gentrify via menu name and cooking process what otherwise is a limit selection of food choices, and make sure diners in the dining areas have direct line of sight to the bar), the actual food at any of them is forgettable. North is no different really; it does not offer anything all that wonderful to talk about. The food, essentially, is of medium catering quality. We three diners (encouraged by our server) started with an anti-pasti board of two cheeses, spicy nuts, some kind of chutney, sourdough bread & salt-cured beef. It was alright, but I could have put something this it together at home from groceries picked-up at Trader Joes that would have been better. Two of us had the same (housemade) pasta dish, while one went for the mussels and roast potatoes (both appetizers). We were all underwhelmed by the quality of the ingredients and the flavor. Maybe we made the wrong choices, but we'll never know because we're not going back.",

I will continue to frequent North because the good far outweighs the bad of today. My advice is don't order the omelette with prociutto, unless you are craving airline quality food. The taste and texture reminded me exactly of the omelettes I have had when flying. Instead, opt for the white polenta and eggs, or the fried eggs in red sauce with Italian sausage. And the Red Rooster (bloody Mary) is outstanding. Please, North, take the omelette off the menu and you will be batting 1000.",

    "text": "Last Saturday my friend and I said, what else is there to do on a Saturday afternoon except eat, drink and hang out.  We definitely went to the right place to do this.  The new NoRTH in Arcadia, Sam Fox's latest creation, met our every need.  I started off with a Stray Dog to drink.  I'm not sure what was in it but it looked pretty and tasted good so I guess that's all that matters.  My friend tasted it and ordered that as her second drink since it was so good.   For an appetizer, we ordered the bread & cheese.  I had no idea what to expect because it said it came with tomato jam.  What is tomato jam?  I'm still not sure I know, but I know I would go back to specifically order this.  The garlic bread came with warm, melted Italian cheese, almost like fondue, in a little skillet.  The bread with the cheese and the tomato jam was the perfect bite...Mmmm.   Next we ordered a pizza to split.  Verdure was the name of it.  It was topped with brussels sprouts, butternut squash, caramelized onions, hazelnuts and ricotta salata.  Need I say more?  Delish!  My friend and I even told the valet guy on our way out to make sure he tried the pizza with the butternut squash.  Next we split a pasta which was a recommendation from our waiter.  (Obviously...how could someone not recommend this).  This was definitely my favorite.  The Agnolotti (definitely homemade!)  was filled with ricotta, mascarpone, pecorino, grana padano and topped with herb butter.  The sauce was so light that it allowed you to eat every single bite, and we both did, without being too rich.  I don't usually eat pasta, but I will definitely be eating this again soon.  It really was so delectable.  Next we split the Scottish salmon salad.  How come I would never think to put marcona almonds and figs in my salmon salad with white balsamic?  It was so tasty and flavorful.  The food being served at tables near us definitely kept catching my eye.  Everything looked so unique and appetizing.  Besides the food, the atmosphere was also very fun and chill.  We were just enjoying our afternoon hanging out and eating amazing food.  Oh wait, I forgot my second drink.  I got the Red Rooster which was like a fancy version of a Bloody Mary.  It came with a little skewer of a caprese on it - really it came with little tomatoes and mozzarella on top of it.  So awesome!  We also ordered affogato for dessert but I was too full to eat it.  My friend said it was orgasmic.  Guess that explains that.  All of the waiters were very attentive.  Service is not always good at a new restaurant, although here it was exceptional.  It was fun to check out (no pun intended) all their different plaid and checked shirts too.  Boring uniforms at a Fox Restaurant...never.  I even told my friend and one of our waiters that this is the best Fox Restaurant yet.  I don't live as close to this restaurant as a lot of other Fox Restaurants, but I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try more yummy food.",

It was very busy for a Sunday evening and the food was absolutely fabulous!!! We started out with the Italian Salad that had a beautiful lemon, oregano dressing.  After we ranted and raved over that,   I had the Ricotta Gnocchi which was beef short ribs in a horseradish creme and arugula.  It was HEAVENLY!!!! I wanted to swim in it, but that would be weird.  My husband had the pork chop with cabbage and a creamy polenta.  It was prepared to perfection!  And dessert?  Normally we say, \"no\".........but please....Italian donuts in a vanilla marscapone cream with lemon curd?  I wanted to cry. Deeelicious.  This is a FABULOUS new hot spot and we have made it our mission to eat our way through the menu!   The servers and staff ALL had smiles and were so kind.  This is my new fav and THANK YOU for being close to home!!!",

Yum! -fonduta-a cheesy fondue with jam on top, doesn't taste tomato-y. I thought it was quite good and I ate more than should have been my allotted portion! -zucca chips-paper thin zucchini slices, fried; we got some lemon dip with them. Pretty darn good, especially when you consider how gross most zucchini is!   Entrees... -strazzapreti-a chicken pasta dish-actually freaking good. -short rib entree-this ties Becketts Table for me in ranking Best Short Ribs in Town! The veggies that come with it are super good too!! -pasta bolonese-my hub thought it was amazing and didn't particularly want to share, but I thought this wasn't exactly my fave, so it worked out well for us. -spicy shrimp pasta-it was good but not amazing. I'd stick to one of the above recommendations instead.  Desserts... -donuts-really good, melt in your mouth, with a lemon dipping sauce that's amazing. -tiramisu-delicious, less cake-y and more creamy than usual, and the chocolate balls on top were quite good. -salted caramel thing-my personal favorite. It was like a very rich creme brulee that was very flavorful of caramel n salt.  All of the desserts are worth getting again.  -atmosphere-pretty loud (on a Friday night)... I had to shout across the table so my somewhat hard of hearing dad-in-law could hear me.  -service-very good.  All in all, a great dining experience.",

Great vibe in the place.  Good decor - it is like a warehouse, open kitchen, etc.  Great happy hour prices and happy hour is all day on Sundays!!  Excellent bucatini with meatballs (homemade pasta) Castrevallano olives - delicious Italian ( not too briny)  Charcuterie & cheese plate with crusty fresh bread - very good Bottles of wine - half price during happy hour.

The service was outstanding and the food just sublime.  Yes, this is North that we're talking about.  If you can request Jodi, then you'll be treated to staff with consummate knowledge about the menu and ingredients.  She is delightful and a tremendous asset to this popular restaurant group.  And the food was just SUPERB!  We began with the proverbial zucca chips and a kale salad that was the BEST kale salad on any restaurant menu!  The vinaigrette was terrific and there was just enough 'crunch' in the kale.  The patata pizza was an epicurean delight!  Pizza dough that was pure perfection!  Cheese and tomatoes that had a faint hint of fennel with aromas designed to make your mouth water.  The strozzapreti pasta with chicken, roasted mushrooms, Bloomsdale spinach, toasted pine nuts, and parmesan creme far surpassed our expectations.  Great texture, great flavor; would order again in a heartbeat.  The salted caramel boutini provided that appropriate topping of a delectable evening and is large enough for two to share.  Additional wait staff ensured that water glasses and wine were always full.  If this is consistent than North Arcadia is comparable to the best restaurants on the east coast and is working diligently at becoming one of the nation's premier restaurants.  You don't have to dress to impress, but casual elegance is in abundance.",

The environment and staff suffers though from a lack of training - on relationship management and courtesy. All the interactions were brief and as if our server was too busy to take any time and explain the menu to us, or interact because I had taken out my brother-in-law, his wife and my wife there.  In addition, the meals were tasty and I had a great Moscow mule for $10 and the short ribs for $25. My wife ordered the bolognese dish with a Petit Syrah which she liked. Prior to that, we had a trio of bruschetta which wasn't bad but may have had slightly undercooked ingredients. The other two in our family  ordered pasta dishes. Needless to say, my wife and I were not very impressed with the size and portions for the price- $178 for 4 people(nearly $50 total per head) after the tip!",

    "text": "Having enjoyed the North in Kierland Commons, this location had much to live up to. To start, we ordered the highly addicting zucca chips and two glasses of white wine. We were sold on trying the handmade pasta so I got the spicy shrimp and my girlfriend tried the lasagna. The shrimp had a nice kick and I really enjoyed the pasta texture and sauce. You can tell they put an emphasis on quality ingredients. For dessert, we had the sugary doughnuts served on a custard sauce which were ok, though not quite as good as I remembered. The restaurant is open and lively, much like many of the other Sam Fox concepts. For a good meal and a terrific ambiance, you can't go wrong with checking out this \"Italian Farmhouse.\"  FYI - Come prepared to valet your car because the parking lot is packed on a busy night.",

I just wish they provided more of it, I felt bad since I ate more of hers than mine (har har). I got the gnocchi, it was not bad, I have never had gnocchi before so I don't think I will be getting that again. My other friend got the pork with apples on top? I am horrible at describing things at the moment. Anyways, that was really good too, but the pork had a little too much fat so it was kind of a bummer.   I love the atmosphere too and how they have the open kitchen, but I will say this.. I did not see the hot bartender Ron!  :( I just saw very very very short guys  :( :(  All love though haha.",

Jennifer our friendly server was AMAZING! She was tentative but not over baring and would always check on us at the perfect time.  All the employees were prompt to help us out weather it was a food runner, server or buser. We started off with the Italian Farm salad, grilled artichoke and a bottle of Pinot Nero. The salad was DELICIOUS, i couldn't eat it fast enough. The grilled artichoke tasted wonderful but was on the messier side to eat (super juicy) For our entree we ordered the diver scallops.... SO GOOOOOD!  They were the biggest most tender scallops I've ever had, i have been craving them ever since we left! We had the donuts and a cappuccino for dessert..... again nothing but perfect! We regularly visit the Fox Concept Restaurants but North is by far our favorite. They go above and beyond the customer experience and the food has always been incredible.",

Update to the ladies: the flooring situation is still treacherous, however the hardwood interior seems to have lost some of its shine.   After briefly discussing our bad experience at The Henry the waitress thanked us for coming in and made some suggestions including the zucca chips (which we ate 4 bowls of!).  They have some great HH specials at North including a bottle of wine and a pizza for $20!  When the manager noticed our Zucca chips had been dished slightly low he brought an entire extra bowl for the table... what service.  We really had a great time here tonight chatting with the Manager, the servers and each other.  I sincerely feel that any mistake during the dining experience can be overcome by a smile, explanation and apology which was evident tonight when a pizza came out a little late.   I wish I had asked his name but Sam Fox needs to retain this awesome manager; he clearly pitches in, leads by example and was extremely involved in the dinner service.  The patio is beautiful, the food is amazing, and we saw two separate traffic accidents which was crazy.    I enjoyed an AMAZING piece of salmon which I had asked to be cooked well.  It was perfect which I especially appreciate since chef's can sometimes hesitate to overcook fish (which is how I prefer it).  I loved the grain it was served on and the lemon olive oil drizzle just iced the cake.  A friend enjoyed a toffee dessert which was to die for, and since we were celebrating the manager even brought out a celebratory dessert for us to share.    I HIGHLY recommend North for a romantic night out or for HH with friends!",

Mussels in a luscious wine broth with salami nuggets and grilled bread for sopping. Superb. Entree for me was gnocchi with arugula and beef short ribs. Heaven. Other entree was dubbed \"the pig\" pizza. Fabulous crust with various pork sausages. I stole a piece from hub and have to say one of the best pizzas EVER. Dessert was a salted caramel pudding/mousse type concoction that was the bomb. Sweet touch of salt, creaminess. Sigh. As usual Fox does not disappoint. Great meal, service, surroundings. Not cheap but worth it. Molto bene.",

We ended up going on New Years Day and that was probably our biggest problem because it seems the waitress was hung over from the previous night. Our drinks we served promptly (by another server) but that were it ended. We ordered bread for the table because we wanted something to eat while they made our food. She forgot and she was no where to be found. 30 min break? Not sure. She finally surfaced and we reminded her and she brought it a few minutes before our dinner. Not what we had in mind. Our pizzas were brought ( by another server) and they were delicious. Again, she never reappeared to ask us how,it was, if we needed anything else or anything. She disappeared for about an hour. I seriously thought she had left for the day and forgot to tell us but she did make it back to hand us the check but we lost her soon after that. We finally had to find another waitress to pay and left. Don't think We will be back. WHile the food is good, there are too many good restaurants in the area that have better service.",

We sat and sat ,.. 5  minutes before anyone said Boo! Then five glasses and a carafe of tepid water were placed on our table by someone who quickly ran away. Another five minutes, and our server swings by asks curtly if we have any questions about the menu, we ask a couple to which we get rote answers, she flys off leaving us with no more information than when she showed up.   She disappears for another 5 minutes before she comes back to take our order (we are now into our adventure 15 minutes) Orders are made around the table, and just as she takes a step to leave again, I stop her to ask if we might order some drinks? \"Oh Sure\" we place 3 drink orders,.. and ask about portion size of an appetizer, she confirms we need two,.. for our table of 5, I say \"fine ..lets do two\" 5 minutes later our drinks arrive (minuscule),  and 10 minutes after that our food arrives. No appetizers!    When asked, our server replies with \"Oh I thought you were just asking what it was,.. I didn't know you wanted some\" amnesia taking over for the whole \"If we order these,..how many do we need?\" conversation,.. not totally surprising as that conversation was now 20 minutes old.  By now,.. you have the flavor of the service,,.... slow, inattentive and well,.. absentminded.  (and this is the kinder/gentler me saying this)  OK,.. that said,.. the food was A++ very good and plenty of it. (the only reason I did not give it 1 star)   I am hoping this was an off day for the wait staff at North, because the competition in Arcadia is fierce,.. many options consistently outperform my Father's Day experience at North,..
