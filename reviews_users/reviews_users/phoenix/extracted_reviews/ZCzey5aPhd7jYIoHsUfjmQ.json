I ordered the hot pot soup, the udon, seafood and broth was delicious. My girlfriend ordered Pad Thai, very flavorful and the right amount of portions. We also checked in and got free  pork belly and soft shell crab! I'm craving them til this day. We also bought their in-house hot sauce to take back to San Diego. Definitely go!",

We also had ordered another round of cocktails earlier, and it was finally delivered AFTER we had consumed the last dish, and were sitting with our check.

    "text": "A group of us (8 total) came here for lunch from work to celebrate a birthday. Things looked promising when we were first sat down. The waitress was friendly and began to take our drink orders. A few of us ordered iced teas and one of my coworkers next to me requested lemon for his water. When she returned she did not bring any sweeteners for the iced teas and forgot my coworker's lemon. We kept waiting for her to come back around so we could request them but it was very hard to catch her attention. Once we were finally able to it still took a long time for her to bring them as she kept waiting on other tables and taking orders. Finally she returned with the sweetener and took our orders. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. We began to notice that people that had come in after us and ordered after us were already eating and there we still sat waiting. We all began watching the time on our phones - after all, we were all at lunch from work and really needed to get back to the office. Finally the food began to arrive in piecemeal fashion. I ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Bun and the Fried Forbidden Black Rice. The Pork Belly Steamed Bun was excellent and left me wanting more. The bun was soft and the pork belly was cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I could have eaten another 5 of those and been happy! It left me really wanting to try the other options they have. My Fried Forbidden Black Rice was good too. The flavors really went well together and the number of shrimp was commensurate with the amount of rice. However, my first reaction when I saw the bowl was \"...$15 for this small amount?!...\"  It did fill me up but I couldn't help but wonder if I would have still been hungry if I hadn't had the pork steamed bun beforehand. The rest of our party (for the most part) was happy with their entrees. I did hear that the chicken was overcooked on the Chow Mein's and the Chopped Salad was described as \"very heavy\" but nobody had any big complaints. When she brought the bill we realized we had forgotten to ask her to give us separate checks and she stated she wasn't allowed to do that on groups over 6 anyways. She told us that we had to figure out how much we wanted on everyone's cards and she would run them that way. Some of my coworkers found they had been charged for the protein in their Chow Mein's and when they inquired about it the waitress explained that it doesn't come with - even though the menu is very misleading and states \"choice of protein\" in the description. So needless to say their total came to more than they had bargained for. So I don't know if I will be back - at least for lunch. Although the food was good, I just felt that it was very pricy for what you actually get. Maybe it was because it was lunchtime and they don't expect the portions to be as big but if that's the case then they should knock off something for the reduced portions during lunch.",

Pork belly bun was delicious as expected  We each got pork belly ramen - from the Bay Area in California, I have pretty high expectations for ramen, but noodle texture was good and right on.   Kim chee topping was not what you'd typically expect and not what I normally want with my ramen noodle and broth but since it's an Asian fusion restaurant, it was an interesting combo to try. Kim chee aside, the pork belly was crisp and bamboo shoots once soaked in the broth went well with the dish.  Didn't seem like there were a lot of ramen places in the area so this is a great option if you're craving it. You won't be disappointed.",

Since it was my first time there, I wanted an introspective take on the menu, and that's when Nick (one of the 4 owners) came over and walked me through the menu as well as his favorite items.   We started with the chicken fried chicken wings. They were exceptional. The black sesame syrup they drizzled on top was delicious and unlike anything I've tasted. Next, we ordered the smoked \"pig face\" dumplings. These were by far my favorite of the night. Served with kimchi and pickled peppers and their own in house made sriracha. So delicious, I was sad there was only 4! Next, we had one of their steamed buns with the pulled pork. Very delicious, although, I wasn't a fan of the bun itself. Only because this entree comes with two sauces for dipping and the bun would get too spongey.  And finally, we ordered our main dish. I got the chicken katsu with a soft poached egg. SO GOOD. The sauce was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet.  Also, to drink, you have to try the Donny Wang Fiz. Super refreshing and perfect with your meal.  Our server Sydney was very attentive and super nice. The customer service there is outstanding. And the location is perfect, right next door to one of my favorite watering holes, the George and Dragon.   I will definitely be back, and next time to get in on their happy hour!",

The broth tastes terrible!!! But other than that it was a good experience! I'd suggest doing an appetizer and drink night there!",

    "text": "Somebody blew up my phone last week with a group text about doing something. Thanks, thanks a lot. No really, thanks a lot, cause I probable wouldn't have ended up here otherwise. :-) I hopped on the scooter, pushed my way around the corner and found scooter (bike) parking at the bar next door. I did end up asking about a bike rack for their place and they said its on the way and should be up soon - they're only a month or so since opening day, so I guess you can't fault them for that ;-)  A handful of us stopped in for Happy Hour. With mixed drinks at $7 during HH, I had the bartender pour me \"Something with Hendricks, but not too sweet.\" It was Christmas time after all and what a better drink than something that tastes like a Christmas Tree? I left the specifics up to them, I figured they'd know better what to mix together than I would. I ended up with something with lemon and mint, and pretty tasty at that!   After everyone arrived, we all ordered the $5 pork Ramen from the HH menu as well as the Asian chicken wings, both items delish, and both items worth coming back for during HH. I think the draft beers were $3 during HH and the total bill coming to like $60 after tax and tip, it was a reasonably priced dinner and drinks for four.  Their normal menu was a bit pricey for my taste, while I don't think I will aim here if it's not HH, you know I'll definitely be back for that Ramen, especially since I'm just a hop skip and a jump - or a scoot away.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, definitely come try their HH ramen - HH is 4-7pm (for the summer hours at least)!",

For the price of a beer, at most places, you'll get a big ol' bowl of delicious and filling noodles with plenty of umami. Their ramen is filled with scrumptious mushrooms, pork, greens, and topped with a poached egg. When you're ready, pop that egg open, mix the yolk in a bit, and mow the eff down. Pair that with an order of their wings, served with kimchi ranch dressing, and inexpensive brews, and you have a party in your mouth!   Go tonight! Once I'm down for their full dinner, I'll update!",

I also had some shrimp with my salad and I thoroughly enjoyed both of them. We ordered a bottle of sake as well and finished the whole damn thing before we even finished eating :)  Service was on point, food was exactly what i expected when i ordered it.

Started with the chicken wings done Asian style with kimchi and bamboo shoots to garnish.  Very delicious by itself but add the kimchi ranch and it's darn near perfect.  Next up pork ramen with bacon, mustard spiced greens and an egg (I opted to have the shiitake left out a very nice touch that they could do that). The bowl arrives and at first scent I am intrigued to try more. The ramen was cooked perfectly, the egg poached with the right amount of tenderness in the yolk, the pork was think cut but a little too fatty for my liking, the broth so invigorating but it had a spice that I could not place.  This dish is a culinary delight.  And at $5 for happy hour price, just perfect.   The restaurant itself is a very modern industrialish ambiance.  The decor had just the right amount of Asian influence without it slapping you in the face at every turn.  The wait staff was very friendly and eager to treat you as if you were the only patron in the place.  Complimentary valet is available.",

    "text": "We came here last year and enjoyed it so much that my love and I drove about 30min from Fountain Hills to have lunch...and I can't wait to come back already.  There have been some slight changes in the menu since our last visit, such as not having \"build-your-own-Ramen\"... but they now have daily happy hour from 11am to 6pm, virtually lunch and early dinner.   Early November and 78 degrees outside, with a light breeze and plenty of sun, we were eagerly seated outside, on the patio, under the shade. We first ordered cocktails...Thai Basil Gimlet and Paloma. Very delicious and balanced in flavor.  On to lunch...we started with 3 steamed buns, 2 Soft Shell Crab and 1 Tempura Catfish, all three for $12.50.  You can mix and match from the Steamed Buns selection or order one for $4.50 each.  Our waiter suggested Green Sriracha for the seafood items, and it was a perfect spicy pairing for the buns. Next we had Green Curry Hummus to share.  It is large enough to share with 3-4 people, and certainly enjoyable. For the entree we shared the Zesty Noodles.  They use Yakisoba Noodles, with shrimp and crab dressed in Bulgogi sauce, Housemade green Sriracha, and peanuts. Every single bite was well balanced with Asian flavor and spicy.    Their appetizers change seasonally. Service was attentive and friendly...answering all our questions about dishes and menu changes.  If we didn't have plans for dinner, I wouldn't mind coming back for more dishes later in the day...to be honest I may stay in Arizona for a week just to eat out here.  -2017 review #59-",

We sat at the bar right in front of the kitchen and it was a blast to watch them crank out all these amazing dishes, we wanted to try EVERYTHING on the menu. Thank you guys all around, great job! We will definitely be back and will without a doubt check out their other restaurants as well.",

Such great flavor & texture. We also got the house Pad Thai and the pork ramen. My sister is very picky about her ramen and she liked this one. My Pad Thai was delicious. The noodles were nice and firm in a good way. Nothing is more disappointing than getting a Pad Thai that is too saucy or so soft that the noodles break when you lift them. This Pad Thai was supreme. We heard very good things about their cocktails and the rumors are all True! Yes, get a cocktail made by Roman!",

The atmosphere is a very chill vibe and the wood fire stove gives it some more pizazz. The cocktails are very innovative and fun. Happy hour is always an amazing deal, all of the classic cocktails can be sampled for a great price. The standout classics are bees knees and manhattan for me personally. The spicy tuna chips, wings and black bean pancakes are also on happy hour specials and they will change your life or at least your taste buds just a little. The buns are a definite must when ordering, our favorite is the chicken and waffle. The fried rice is amazing especially the duck. The desserts are rotating all delicious all of the time.  Overall this restaurant is always winning when it comes to service, drinks and food.",

Some of the best bartenders have stepped foot in this establishment and served us amazing drinks. They really care about what they are doing. I am a firm believer that not just anyone should be a bartender, just like not everyone should be a physician... it takes knowing your craft and loving what you do. This place stands above and beyond in this area and that is just the drinks to start.  Second and not at all second to the drinks is the food... I know there is one other in the valley but this is our go to.  The ramen... amazing and I mean amazing on all levels. I have never needed to use their hot sauce but hear that it is amazing. Everything is fresh and made to order so don't expect this to be a fast food restaurant.   This is the type of place that you take your time, enjoy your drinks, enjoy the show of your food being prepared in front of you (something we should never take for granted) and enjoy being satisfied beyond measure.  Always a pleasure stopping in here!",

I came here for my birthday dinner last night and I LOVED e v e r y t h i n g about it! The overall atmosphere was upbeat and chic. We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen - definitely the best seats in the house because everyone working in the kitchen is so dope and friendly.  The menu offered innovative choices with unique ingredients (foodie approved). We started with The Enabler to drink. YUM. Then we ordered pig face and rabbit dumplings, and BBQ jackfruit steam buns for dinner. It was sooo good. I drooled all my lipstick off real quick. For dessert we got banana fritters, and they were FIRE. They forgot to put the birthday candle on it so they also gave us fruity pebble mochi ice cream with a candle!!! It. Was. Lit! (Pun intended)  This restaurant is the be all and end all. My new favorite. The only food I'll ever want.",

I enjoyed every dish we ordered this time around.   Tempura Catfish Steamed Buns - devoured these warm steamed buns with crispy, perfectly fried catfish and fantastic tartar sauce very very quickly  Pork Ramen - great, chewy noodle texture, fantastic crispy pork belly, and excellent soft boiled egg again  Spicy Tuna Chips - not very spicy and very tasty when you get that perfect bite with the ahi tuna, wasabi guacamole on the rice paper chip  Soft Sell Crab Po'Boy - nicely fried crab but a little too much aioli sauce for me  On top of enjoying the food, I enjoyed their house hot sauces. So much in fact, that I bought a bottle of their sriracha. I will definitely be back for Happy Hour.",

    "text": "I had never heard of Clever Koi, until a week or so ago when I saw an ad on facebook. There are two locations, in Gilbert and Phoenix. We decided to check out the Phoenix location.  My boyfriend had called ahead for a reservation,  but unfortunately, they only take reservations on weekends for parties of 6 or more. We arrived around 7:45-8 and was told there would be about an hour wait.  We were going to look for another restaurant, but while we were doing that, we scooped up one last spot at the bar to have a drink. While I was seated at the last available bar stool, my boyfriend had to stand.  As we checked out the drink menu, one of the bartenders let us know there were a few people seated at the middle of the bar, and that he would hold 2 seats for us to move down. (By this time,  several other small groups had arrived after us.) A few minutes later, the bartender had us moved down, and my boyfriend and I decided to stay and order our drinks and dinner there-and I'm SO glad we did!   The atmosphere was very cool - an open style kitchen, 2 bars, and a little outdoor patio area.  I actually preferred sitting at the bar and watching the amazing bartenders making their creative concoctions! All of the drinks looked amazing (I can't wait to go back and try more!)   For our first cocktail, my boyfriend and I shared the \"Scorpion\", which is a huge drink for 2, in a bowl, with several liqours (I believe brandy, rum, and gin), oranges, and cinnamon, and it is served flaming.  It was DELICIOUS and pretty strong!   For our dinner, I had the lemongrass chicken ramen. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the chicken had great flavor. My boyfriend had the duck wings. I was a little hesitant to try the wings, because I'm SUPER picky, but OMG they were amazing! The meat was so tender, it fell right off of the bone.  After dinner, we got another round of drinks.  I ordered a drink that was called \"You better call Tyrone\" (or something like that) which has made with chocolate liquers.  This was yummy, but a little bit too strong for me, so we ended up switching drinks. The other one we had ordered was called \"Almost always bad news\", made with rums and citrus flavors, and served in a cool tiki cup. This one was also fruity, delicious and strong!   The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and even took several pictures for us. We can't wait to go back soon!",

    "text": "On a spur of the moment, a few Friday nights ago, my husband and I popped into Clever Koi. This restaurant had long been on my , 'must try' list and I was happy we finally agreed to see what it was all about. We did not make a reservation and at first , I was bummed because the super friendly hostess said it would be a good 40 - 50 minute wait. I am not a patient person and I hate waiting. The bar was also standing room only. I knew that meant good things awaited us. I did notice , upon walking in, Central Bar is right next door so when the hostess took our name and asked what kind of table would be our first choice, I asked if we could leave our number because we would be at Central Bar. Well, better yet, she said she would come get us when our table was ready! About 40 minutes later we were sat in the very lively Clever Koi after she retrieved us from next door. Now that's service! The decor is dimly lit and the vibe is high energy and chic. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff are cool and friendly. To start with I tried the Singapore Sling: gin; agricanto cherry; cointreau ; benedictine ; pineapple and a little grenadine. This drink will remind you of a beachy climate under a palm tree .. it will also buzz you up! It's a little sweet and sneaky strong. Overlooking the menu at Clever Koi, this isn't the Americanized chinese food you find all around. It's Asian fusion and very unique with some of its offerings and ingredients. I liked that the Clever Koi and its team use local ingredients as much as possible to support the local community. That means fresh and organic. For the most part, many of the dishes are small plate in concept unless you go for the noodle or rice dishes. I seriously wanted to try it all! My husband and I started with the Soft Shell Crab and Chicken / Waffle Steamed Buns. These come out in little taco type 'stands' to your table. My soft shell crab steamed bun was out of this world with taste! It had just the right amount of alioli , cucumber slaw over this crisp soft shelled crab and at $4 the price isn't bad for getting more than one! My husband's chicken & waffle steamed bun was good, but not my favorite. The 'bun part' is actually a kimchi waffle around the chicken drizzled with chile maple and a little scallion. I also ordered the Pig Face Dumpling: These come four per order for $9. Pig Face to me is another way of saying, 'pork cheeks'. This was a steamed bun and inside was amazing tender pork and so much flavor! We shared a Crispy Pineapple Duck Rice. This dish is like crispy rice with crispy leg of duck , carrots, eggplant and mushroom and placed on the plate in such a presentable way, you almost don't want to it because it looks so pretty! This dish was also very tasty! Truly there is so much here on Clever Koi's menu , we found it hard to choose. It's a way to take your foodie taste buds on a culinary adventure, for sure , and I always recommend trying new and adventurous things like that! There are more main stream dishes here in case some of the items are too 'off the norm ' for you like Pad Thai or even Ramen, which for a second, when the table next to me got their ramen, I stared hard and wondered if I was gonna have that food envy and sorrow of not getting that when my order arrived ! Well, where as I do not even discount that those ramen bowls were amazing , my choices were out of this world! My tip: Make a reservation! You will wait on a Friday or Saturday night and likely other nights too! This place is ultra cool and has amazing cool dishes to go along with it... you won't be disappointed.",

Upon walking in we were greeted warmly by the staff & seated immediately. We ordered some cocktails that were amazing! I ordered the Martinez which is like an old fashion but made with gin...this is a must try! My friends all enjoyed their cocktails that they ordered & I can attest to that, since I sampled everyone's beverage in our table.   For food I ordered the mushroom ramen, which was to die for! I rarely order ramen, but plan to order it from here every chance I get. The broth is not too thick and very flavorful! My friends all ordered meat dishes, which they loved but I couldn't sample since I don't eat meat.   The ambiance is fantastic, portions are great, brilliant food & cocktails, plus great customer service. I plan on returning very soon!",

Overall we are very pleased that I hope to come back sometime.  Returned 5/29/16, tried the seafood hot pot which was really good.  The chow mein with beef had a great taste but I thought was a little dry.  Others in our group tried and really liked the Thai beef chow mein with chicken.",

Although I can't remember the names of all the dishes, some good appetizers to start off with are the Char Siu Beef  Spring Roll and the Smoked \"Pig Face\" (How can you say no to these names?). The noodles are a must try and everything else on the menu is as well. We asked for chef choices and did not regret it. The prices are pretty average, $8 to $13. The cocktails are also unique and rather tasty. We tried the Temperance Trap, The Enabler, and the Honor Your Dojo (again... How can you say no to these names?). The ambience was cool and the service was great! They also have a nice patio area that faces central ave. A must try!",

My wife ordered the pork ramen and I had the crispy lemon chicken ramen, and neither of us could decide which one we liked better, they're THAT good. One thing we both agreed on was that the spicy chicken and waffle bun we ordered as an appetizer was amazing! I seriously could have ordered a few more and called it a night with just the buns. But do yourself a favor and save room for some ramen!  Five stars for the ambiance and great service as well. I love how everyone works together as a team. We had at least 4-5 different staff members taking care of us during our meal. This resulted in quick and efficient service and a flawless dining experience! We will be back soon without a doubt.",

I had the fried rice with chicken and we basically ate until we couldn't eat anymore, and then tried to continue eating. Everything was amazing, and fresh, and SO unique. I can't compare it to any other restaurant here because there is nothing like it!  We also had great drinks, and the service was amazing. David is on his game. He knows the restaurant, the food, and the drinks inside and out. He makes you feel like he is your friend and is not just trying to sell you on anything. I honestly thought he was the owner because of how knowledgeable he is.   Not only will we be going back for the food, but also to see David!  PS - this is a great place for a date night.

    "text": "My review is negative because it reflects the food. The restaurant itself is very nice. Well decorated and servers very attentive. Clean, good atmosphere. However, the food was very disappointing.  Shrimp Toast - breaded scallions with sriracha aioli. Very reminiscent of fried tofu with shrimp flavors underlying, which is definitely not a bad thing. Big flaw with the dish was the sriracha aioli. Tasted like pure mayonnaise. Completely brought the appetizer dish down. A shame. Good in concept, horrid in execution. Dump the sauce and just eat the \"toast.\"  Wok Roasted Chicken Wings - Not bad, but not good. Wings were coated in a \"Sriracha Hoisin glaze.\" The Hoisin was noted. The Sriracha was not. Lacking heat. Also, noted dearth of sauce. Good wings need a lot of sauce, its primary source of flavor. Positive points: wings cooked well and coated with a peanut crumble for textural dimension. Presentation admirable. Taste did not meet expectations.   Pork Ramen - mediocre at best. Noodles were extremely good, very creamy and filling. Everything else in the bowl was not up to speed. The pork wasn't seasoned, difficult to chew, and overcooked. Bowl had pickled daikon, a welcome surprise, but not enough to elevate the dish. Broth lacked identity, very watery.   Good Asian food in Phoenix is difficult to find. My review has been calibrated to the lower standards of Phoenix's Asian cuisine fare. 2 Stars means \"I've experienced better.\" So yes, I have experienced better Asian food in Phoenix than the dishes at The Clever Koi. Very disappointing indeed.",

I ordered a pork belly ramen - thinking mistakenly that this meant tonkatsu. Nope, no tonkatsu ramen. The pork ramen comes out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The egg yolk was already broken on mine which is usually not a big deal. But my problem was the broth.  Totally utterly flavorless broth. My partner noticeably saw my face go from yay I'm gonna get some ramen to sad face in record time. It needed salt too which for a pork ramen is kind of ludicrous. I liked the consistency of the noodles though, so yay for that. The pork in the ramen was ok, though it could've been a bit more tender. My partner's lemon grass chicken ramen was also weak in the broth area though the other flavors came together a bit better overall in that one.  I will definitely check this place out for their other dishes. The decor is awesome and has great ambiance and wait staff are friendly, but the ramen failed this city, as The Arrow would say.",

Even though it's right on the busy Central corridor, it was a peaceful, hip oasis.   The menu has something for everyone, including a variety of vegan options. We started with the root vegetable dip, which was flavorful and quite filling even for an appetizer. Fortunately, we split it so we had room for the main event - dan dan noodles made with Impossible \"meat.\" Incredible! It was so good that we half-joked we should order a second round.   Our drinks were tops, too. We got there in time to get the first round on happy hour. I had an old favorite, the Manhattan, but there were several classic and specialty cocktails on the menu I want to come back to try.",

Highly recommend the riding the pine cocktail as well as that strawberry blonde beer is one of my favorites!",

Tonight we walked in at 9:30pm thinking we would have an hour and a half to eat, totally forgetting it was a Sunday. We bartended Pride all weekend and were craving CK. When we walked in a young curly haired employee told us we were to late. They closed at 9pm tonight.  Being bummed we shared our disappointment with him and then asked to use the restroom really fast. When one of our group members walked out of the restroom the employee asked if he stole toilet paper. When I walked out of the restroom i stopped at the bar to say thank you and ask where we should go, on a Sunday for food... He said, \"Five & Diner\" in a condescending tone. I said, I'm a local and want something decent in the area. We bartended all day at Pride and want something good. We never go out on Sundays. He responded with, \"Five & Diner\".   Just disappointed. We all know the food can only carry a restaurant so far. The service has to be somewhat good at some point.   Thanks for your time.  Hope it's better next time.   Lauren",

I really appreciate that the food and customer service is consistent and exceptional. It's a small location that houses some of the most knowledgeable staff members I have met. Great location for a date night or meet up with friends. Great drinks & music are always a super plus as well.  I heart you Clever Koi.

Service was awful even though there was no one in there at lunch time. No recommendations, no help. I asked for a Chardonnay that never came - so told whoever brought my food to cancel it. My server didn't come by until after I was done with my meal to say - oh hey sorry about that Chardonnay. So insincere and nasty I don't know why she bothered mentioning it at all. She still charged me for it so had to have it taken off. The bottle wasn't never opened or poured.  I won't be back.",

We got the short rib dumplings which were a tasty but light appetizer in flavorful broth. Next were the steamed buns- crispy pork belly and fried chicken. Packed full of flavor and crunch in a soft pillowy dough. Finally for entrees we got the banh mi and the pork ramen- wow! We can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu!",

There are several menu items that are available for \"Happy Hour\" which is during the lunch hour, which is nice.  I had the Banh Mi at the Happy Hour price.  It was a sandwich with pork on it and the Asian flavors on it.  I had the fries with it and they were quite good.''  We sat on the patio because the weather was nice.  Only issue with that was the tree that shades the patio had lots of leaves and small flowers and all the other stuff that comes with trees dropping on us and the food.  It didn't bother us--we just had to be careful what we were putting in our mouths was food and not tree \"stuff\".  Our waiter was a nice guy--not overbearing and let us alone which we appreciated.  Will definitely return!",

We had a dinner reservation (which I highly recommend) but we went early to order a couple cocktails and an appetizer during their happy hour.   Cocktails were exquisite. I had the Bees Knees. A gin concoction with lemon, honey, and lavender. It was so smooth and delicious, even my husband who normally hate gin thought it was good. We also had edamame fritters which were very good and paired nicely with our cocktails.   For dinner I had the summer corn ramen and my husband had the Mongolian beef. The hubs was blown away by his dish. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and everything was flavorful. He raved about it for days. I thought my ramen was very good. It had a very light and creamy broth. I prefer spicier dishes and luckily they had a bottle of sriricha on the table. I will try something a little bolder next time. However I work close by and I can totally see myself ordering this for lunch when I'm feeling under the weather and need something comforting.   The service all around was great, from the friendly host who seems to go above and beyond for guests to the easygoing bartenders to our informative server. Although the restaurant was super busy, the staff never seemed to lose their cool and remained friendly and eager to please. We will be back.",

The friendly and attentive service. I can go on.   Their happy hour menu features so many great dishes AND drinks which to me says a lot because I feel that some restaurants are so minimal on their happy hour menus. I came here with my family, a party of 5. We ordered everything on the happy hour food menu to share (5 dishes, minus the wood grilled veggies). The pork ramen was so good, we ordered 2! We all were fighting for the last bit. We added a kimchi fried rice with pork belly which was so good, I want to try it again with the other proteins. From rave reviews, we ordered each steamed bun (5) for each one of us and WOW! Just wow. So full of flavor like all the other dishes. And the greatest part, is that all of these dishes plus 3-4 drink orders came out to exactly $100. I was expecting much more! I am surprised that Clever Koi isn't swamped for happy hour on a Saturday! I won't accept coming here any other way. And I will definitely be back for more.  I enjoyed this restaurant experience from start to finish! Can't wait for the next.",

    "text": "Three friends and I enjoyed a fantastic evening out earlier this week at The Clever Koi. We started at the bar where I abandoned my usual libations and ordered The Enabler, which is described as hickory-infused 12 year old whisky, grilled lemon juice, lapsang maple syrup and burlesque bitters. It was so good that I had another.   For dinner, the four of us decided to just order a ton of stuff and share family style. Armed with our chopsticks, we were reminiscent of a family dinner in which the fastest eaters get to, well, eat. You snooze, you lose! Luckily we ordered in phases, so we continually had food coming. We thought at first we were insane for ordering so much, but we managed to pretty much polish our plates.  Here's what we had:  5 stars -- The beet salad with mizuna, shaved cucumber, pickled ginger, tempura bean curd and lemongrass vinaigrette.    5 stars -- The salt and pepper shrimp with scallops and XO sauce.  5 stars -- The long beans with crispy duck tongue and XO aioli.  Steamed Bun: Schreiner's lop chong with daikon slaw and spicy Japanese mustard (can't star it because I didn't get a bite!!)  5 stars -- Smoked \"pig face\" dumplings with kimchi and pickled peppers.  5 stars -- Kimchi duck fried rice  5 stars -- Massaman udon noodles with red curry, roasted duck, fingerling potatoes, pickled peppers, peanuts and crispy cilantro.  (MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT!!)  5 stars -- Ramen with roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and soft-boiled egg.  The ONLY thing we had that we didn't love was the \"Mission Chinese\" Kung Pao Pastrami. It just didn't do it for us, and everything else was SO out of this world, that it paled in comparison.  Go, go, go to The Clever Koi!",

When we started seeing people getting their bowls before us of course we asked about it and were told the other table had their cards filled out before us. Well okay I suppose, I wasn't really paying that close attention but I did watch our server waiting at the counter. So food comes out, not all at the same time so a coworker had to wait while everyone had theirs. She had rice. Come on...I know the rice and noodles are prepared ahead of time. Why is it taking so long?  Another coworker commented that her noodles were burned. I checked mine-some were burned as well.  The server gave her another bowl which tasted much better. I will say the the shrimp I had was good and my friends like their proteins as well So $10 for 4 decently cooked shrimp, half burned noodles and a 30 minute wait when we were one of the first to be seated. Not worth it to me so I won't come back.",

We had the smoked and grilled vegetables with flat steak that was a perfect medium rare. It came with two dipping sauces, one sweet and a pesto. We also had edamame fritters, and some Raman Soup.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are both teachers, so during our breaks, we like to enjoy weekday dates (something we don't normally experience during the school year). We knew about a $2 bowling special on Tuesday nights at our local alley so we decided to make an evening of it and go to dinner first. I had heard good things about The Clever Koi so we went to try it out.  First, let me start by saying I love the building The Clever Koi is located in, as well as the surrounding businesses. It's a cool, modern space with a few traditional oriental touches. We were bummed to realize that all of the patio tables were full, but unsurprised as it was a gorgeous evening outside. Instead, we posted up at the bar where we were greeted by our waiter/bartender (who I later realized is also an owner). We were given menus and discovered that they are currently running a deal for $35 that included 4 beers and 2 bowls. Score! We chose to upgrade to 4 cocktails for an extra $5 and ordered a dark & stormy and a whiskey drink called the blinker; both were excellent. We ordered our entrees (pork ramen for me, mongolian beef bowl for the fella), but also decided to try 2 of the steamed buns as an appetizer. We got the more traditional duck bun, as well as the chicken and waffle bun. Those came out within a few minutes, and I have to say, as much as I wanted to like the chicken and waffle steamed bun, I couldn't. The menu description said \"kimchi waffle\", but I couldn't taste any bite from the kimchi in the dish. Likewise, the menu stated there was a \"chili maple syrup\", but I didn't taste any heat. The chicken was cooked well, but there was just nothing special about it and the waffle was kind of cold and soggy. The duck bun, on the other hand, was quite good, although nothing special again. The portion size was fairly large for $4.50 though and I would be interested to try their 2 other styles of steamed buns.  After a drink refill, our main courses arrived and oh. My. God. It was good. The pork ramen broth was flipping amazing. Big hunks of delicious pork belly floated around, as well as a kimchi and a soft egg. The combo of crunchy, spicy kimchi was so well paired with the creamy egg center. It was seriously so amazing, I can't wait to go back when the weather cools down a little more and gulp it by the bowl full. My boyfriend really enjoyed his mongolian beef too, demolishing the whole bowl. I saved some of my ramen to take home and it reheated perfectly the next day.  Overall, a really solid experience. The decor was awesome, the service was casual and friendly, and even a not so stellar steamed bun couldn't ruin an absolutely phenomenal ramen. I can't wait to go again!",

We went on a Friday evening and, as expected, it was packed. We were able to get outdoor seats and liked our seating and ambiance. One of our drinks, Temperence Trap, was the highlight of the evening. The drink had a lot going on and was refreshing.  The food, however, was decent but unexceptional. In fact, we have tried much better at many other places.   I tried Seafood Hot Pot which had a decent amount of seafood in it. The broth was unexceptional. The dish lacked something but I can't point to one item. Broccolini Ramen could have used more broth. It was too dense especially given the flavor profile and the ingredients. Our server was attentive but impersonal which was okay with us.  Now I would have given it four stars if it wasn't for the price. We found it to be on the pricier side given that dishes were rather standard. I am sure a lot went into them but our palates missed whatever it was. I would be more sympathetic to these prices if the restaurant was located in an upcoming area in Miami or the Bay area.   Overall, it is a decent place if you want to spend your evening in a place with a good vibe.",

Their green tea tiramisu was definitely outside of the box, but super delicious to finish the meal!  super yum!",

The first time I went to clever koi I thought it's an Asian restaurant by non-Asian owner who knows Asian food, and I tired a pork Ramen it just looks so right,  first bit isn't impressing, then I find a little bit sour from the soup, so they put kimchi in to a bowl of Ramen! Seriously?(Ramen and soup is from JP it never will be even a little bit sour and Kimchi is from KR which should be pretty hot and a little bit sour but the soup neutralized the hot left only sour taste unnatural) It destroyed all my good feelings about this place. The second time I went here, I tried the same Ramen without kimchi That should fix my feeling than BOOM. I was wrong, it's not even better than the first time everything taste boring   at lest kimchi works better. After that time I never ordered any 'looks and sounds like Asian food' no more, turns out all the other is as good as it looks I'm glade.",

There were dirty plates on our table from the beginning all the way to the end. They came by once and cleared a few plates but never came back. Also all of the meals were served at different times so when one person waited until the last was there it was cold. The drinks were good and the dumplings.",

After ordering she asked hostess for crackers or a little something as she is a diabetic and was getting shaky. After a few minutes, I decided to run out to the car to get something for her to eat. I came back in and she still had not gotten the piece of bread that they were going to bring to her. She about completed the breakfast crackers I brought in before they brought out the bread. It took awhile before getting food. When you order ramen/saimin back home on Maui, it comes out in no time. Anyway, the ramen with dashi broth had no flavor and the noodles didn't have any either. The shrimp in the ramen also lacked flavor. They asked if I wanted anything else, and I just want rice as I ate the shrimp (because I needed to get something in my belly). The sweet sour pork was mediocre. Waiter had no enthusiasm, didn't check on us, didn't see him smile...or at least I didn't see him smile. On a good note, they did not charge me for the meal. This just reiterates why we always eat at the same places. The last couple of times we tried someplace new to us, we were very, very disappointed! Que sera sera.",

They come in a bunch of flavors, and the only downside is you can't really cut the dang things to share. But you probably won't share anyways! The house bacon and pickled mustard greens are superb, rich and tasty. The roasted duck noodles are perfect and are just the right size for a meal and the chicken katsu with the egg on top is great as well. Great bar selection, very nice and attentive staff and some chefs that look like they mean business makes this a really nice place for those of us that enjoy the tapas experience. Great, great, great....",

    "text": "Went here on a Friday night...the place was packed.  We had a wait of about 30 mins so grabbed some cocktails from the bar, standing room only.  Since I was really thirsty and slammed my delicious IPA too quickly, I had to avail myself of the facilities.  Tables are super close together, not much aisle space.  On my way down the aisle to the loo, I felt like Super Mario...I had to dodge the servers, move out of the way or else be trampled over.  They weren't budging, so I had to.  Who is the customer here?!  Ok, no biggie, whatev.  When I was done, the table was ready.  Again, very close together.  I know waaaaaaay too much about the two tables next to us now.  Anyway, we sat down.  And waited.  And waited, even though there was a woman waiting on the tables on either side of us.  We looked at each other like, \"WTF, are we in the Twilight Zone and no one can see us?\"  Finally got her attention after actually contemplating whether we should just get up and leave.  She seemed almost bothered but brought us menus.  Another wait.  She eventually came to get our orders.  We had questions, she answered them.  The food came and it was DELICIOUS!!  It almost made up for the bad service, BUT, even though that food was really, really good, there were ingredients not listed, everything just wasn't the same as the menu.  It would have been the last straw if it didn't taste so good.   C'mon, treat a customer with a little respect, acknowledge their presence with a little less disdain and put all ingredients of the dish on the menu (some people have food allergies).    The delicious food saved it from one star.",

All I can say is I've worked in 50 plus restaurants and bars and have 13 plus years in the industry (not just in Arizona). This place has something between simplicity and charm within hitting the bull's eye while still having just the right complexity. These guys are pros with passion. You can see it from their golden jiggers to their innovative drinks. I recommend this place for a  unique business lunch, a well elaborate deep thought at the bar while discussing cocktails travels and the food you're eating, or dates for multiple courses with extreme value. Then if you want to get more tipsy ( as this not that place) you can venture next door once you're full. Then catch the light rail, valet , or catch a cab home. prime location for dates as there is a pond near by, hair salon, and wine bar. Cocktails Kick ass!",

So one Saturday i decided to travel uptown to try it out, looked so cute and amazing from the outside, the tacky \"asian\" decor didn't turn me off one bit, neither did the upscale price tag for the food, but (there is always a but) the weird insanely tangy sauces and broth for the \"soups\" did.. i am not sure what the chefs were thinking, but these are not flavors meant for these dishes, at all..   i like \"fusion\" food as much as the next guy but the lamb pastrami bun tasted as they just saw one in a magazine and tried to match it without reading the ingredients.  kimchi fried rice, it was more of typical Chinese fried with clear kimchi thrown on top of it, which is \"technically\" kimchi fried rice, but not what it is supposed to be.  There was a sour element to it that is not found in Korean cuisine, that could just be due to the fusion.    up next we have the \"ramen\" .. uhm, if all you have had is Top Ramen, you may find this blend delightful or just amazingly odd, as for me, i enjoy my Japanese food, so this tangy mess was definitely a let down as well.  another one of us ordered some katsu thing, but that is not even worth describing, unless you have a sweet tooth.  the duck steamed bun was the only savior of the bunch, my only gripe was the bao was much too dense, and i ended up leaving half it on my plate, when usually that is the best part.   If the pricing wasn't so pretentious, i would have thought about giving this two stars.",

The hubs and I took my parents here for dinner to celebrate my mothers health.  We waited about 25 minutes for our table - even though there were other tables sitting empty.    My mom and I ordered the seafood hot pot. Okay when you think hot pot, you think of those pots where you throw in a bunch of veggies, seafood, meat, what have you - never did I think that it meant it was SPICY HOT.  We had started off with our unimpressive appeitzer of the catfish/scallop/shrimp dumplings with \"nuoc cham\" which is basically fish sauce.  The four dumplings were about the size of a quarter and sat inside a HUGE bowl filled with fish sauce.  For $8, I'd say that's a hefty rip off.  We all literally leaned in towards the table to look inside the giant bowl at our dumplings.  Next up we ordered the wood grilled octopus/sea weed/xo aioli sauce - BLAH.  All bun, no octopus.  We also tried the peking duck/house bacon/mizuna/charred plum jam - that was just meh.  Ugh so disappointing, at yet another $4/bun.    My mom's SPICY seafood udon bowl came out - it was too spicy so she gave it to my dad.  And he ate it.  Said it was decent.  We sat there and watched him eat.....eat.....eat....eat....and then he was done.....and we sat there and looked at his empty bowl as our bowls had still yet to come out.  I don't get it, we ordered 2 of the same bowls - at least the 2nd one should have come out?  The hostess came to clear my dads bowl - I told her we still hadn't gotten ours yet, she kinda apologized and walked off.  About 15 minutes later, the 2nd udon bowl came out and one of the pork ramen bowls came out.  So I told my mom and hubs to eat.  As I sat there and watched them eat.....and eat.....and eat.  Towards their last few bites, my pork ramen bowl came out - the server, or maybe it was the manager came out to deliver it to me and apologized for the delay of the entire meal and said this bowl was on the house.  That was a nice gesture - but considering the circumstances, all our bowls should have been comp'd.  My mom and I couldn't finish our pork bowls - it was so extremely salty - the \"broth\" was so dark it tasted and looked like it was sitting in a bowl of soy sauce.    After my 1 comp'd ramen bowl, our bill still came out to over $80.  I'm all for fusion food - but this was just ridiculous.",

We had the massaman curry noodles and the spicy seafood. Spicy seafood was not spicy, it very bland and missing flavor. As was the curry, I know it's not as spicy as other curry, but I expected some flavor. It may have been an off night. But we will not return based upon our first visit.",

    "text": "I have been to The Clever Koi 3 times now, the first two times it was, well, ok.  This last time was terrible, with the exception of the server.  My girl friend and I went in at 6:45 on Saturday.  They were very busy and quoted us an hour to hour and a half wait.  No big deal, day before Valentine's Day, we get it. We give the host our name and number so that she may call us when our table is ready.  We went next door to the little wine shop, which is awesome by the way, split a bottle of wine and had some snacks.  An hour and forty minutes later we walked back over to ask about the table.  The host said that she had called 3 times, receiving a messaging saying my phone was out of order.  I immediately had my girlfriend call me, it rang right way.  I really do not think she even called. I also made sure the number was written correctly on the wait list and it was.  We sat down at a table on the patio, ordered some drinks and appetizers.  The drinks came out quickly which was nice, but it took 39 minutes for our starters to hit the table.  No matter how busy you are, that is a very long time.  We also ordered the duck curry, that only took about 20 minutes to arrive.  Unfortunately we did not enjoy the flavor very much, or the very small about of duck that it was served with, so we kindly sent it back after only a few bites.  It was removed from our bill and we were very thankful.   My biggest issue is that in events like this, the manager should come over and at least let you know about the wait and/or apologize.  Not that it is their fault, they can't control the back up in the kitchen, but, it doesn't hurt to touch a table.    The manager only came over after we had paid and we were standing up to leave.  His comments were short, and there was no apology. If anything it was more of a questionnaire with excuses tied in. Doesn't matter.    My girlfriend and I have more than 20 years of upscale dining management combined.  We know very well that the job is to \"recover\" a customer if you will, when you know about a poor experience.  I wish things would have gone differently at The Clever Koi.",

    "text": "I went with a friend and got the kung pao chicken wings ($5 happy hour from 3-6 daily), pork ramen, lemon pepper chicken ramen, and two steamed buns with pork belly. The only negative thing I would have to say about Clever Koi is that the steamed buns were $4 each and they aren't very big. I honestly thought it was worth it though, because the crunchy top of the pork belly mixed with the delicious flavor of the sauce and meat were the perfect combination. The pork ramen was a steal from the happy hour menu as well for only $8 as opposed to $13.50. The broth was incredibly flavorful, but I wasn't a huge fan of the kimchi.  I thought the other ramen dish was also a 5 star, as the chicken was crunchy throughout the whole meal and the broth was nice and light. I was surprised when we weren't overly stuffed after, but I would still recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to try some new exotic flavors and is okay with spending a little extra money. The service was very fast and friendly and the atmosphere was enjoyable. All in all, I love Clever Koi and I'm definitely coming back.",

They were too thin, they were overcooked, and they were clearly pre-made. In fact, we were told as much.  The noodles were soggy and not quite as good as those you get from Kraft. The Steamed Buns- their fusion item - was thick, doughy and taco like- but without the flavor.  The duck was overcooked in the buns, the noodles, and the dumplings. The service was as slow as one could imagine. Sorry- but when you have had great Chinese food in China, this place ranks below any chain American Chinese restaurant (PF Chang's has better dumplings).  Hard to imagine that people would really like this place, when there are other places that have freshly made food. Atmosphere is nice- I imagine the next owner will improve on the service and the food",

Lighting was right, music, design, and even the cutlery was cool. The bar menu looked great and was fun to read.  Cons: We ordered a few items off the menu. We started with dumplings and they were OK. I then had the fried rice with pork and it was honestly the best fried rice I've had. My date tried a noodle dish but I can't remember the name of it. It came with two fried onion rings on top;I thought it sucked. We were still hungry so we tried some buns that were hit and miss. The one with duck was very tasty;however, the texture of the duck made taking a clean bite impossible. I know duck is fatty but this was super tough, similar to an over cooked piece of carne asada.  The octopus sausage bun was excellent.   I'll come back to Clever Koi in a month or so to see how things have changed.   P.S. The house made \"Sirracha\" sauce was killer! Loved it.",

The restaurant is a lovely modernistic Asian spin and is beautiful in its own unique way. The Pork belly ramen noodle soup is a spectacular taste of heaven I cannot express how much I loved this ramen, the broth wasn't too salty and let the other ingredients of the soup speak for itself. The real star of the ramen was of course the pork belly, which the deep fry but the pork was still tender and super flavorful. The pork bun was also very good, the bun was very fluffy and the sauce the pork came with was the right amount of Asian Hoisin. The staff were amazing as they made sure that your eating experience was the upmost best. Nick was especially very nice and welcomed us and made sure the food was perfect. I cannot wait for our next trip to Phoenix just so I can get another bowl of ramen.",

    "text": "I came here for the first time during Restaurant Week and this was the best meal I've had in a while. My wife and I sat at the bar overlooking the open kitchen. I had the roasted corn dumplings and kung pao fried chicken. I didn't take a photo but I should have because the presentation was very appealing, and they tasted even better.   The dumplings were a small pond of a tomato ginger broth which had the perfect amount of spice. The kung pao chicken was the same idea as you'd find in an American Chinese restaurant except everything was fresh and cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. My wife had the caesar salad and mongolian beef. The salad was a fairly typical caesar but with szechuan croutons and a poached egg on top. The mongolian beef was, like the chicken, the same idea as  what is offered at American Chinese restaurants but more sophisticated and executed to perfection (the roasted cashews were a nice touch).   And then they went ahead and nailed dessert. The fritters were fried and they were delicious. And the tea-a-misiu was a great tiramisu but with a hint of tea, I think I liked it even better than regular tiramisu.   Well done, Koi, we will be back.",

For this night, we got the pork belly steamed bun, galbi short ribs, and pork ramen. We washed our dinner with a rum old fashion, riding the pine, and the scorpion. The steamed bun had a very soft and plain shell which balanced well with the salty and sweet pork belly. It's a good start to the main dishes. The short ribs are sweet and smokey and is as expected. It wasn't over seasoned nor was it too dry either. It's a generous serving size for two people. Lastly, the ramen was something unexpected. It didn't quite taste like traditional ramen where it's typically on the salty end of flavor; but it was savory with a sight hint of salt and pork flavored broth. It reminds me a bit of a pho broth more so than traditional ramen - which isn't a bad thing. I enjoyed it because it wasn't too strong on any particular flavor and it wasn't plain either. The pork is definitely what it's worth. It was not tough and provided a gelatinous texture along with the stringy and bouncy ramen noodles. This was a good take on ramen. All of our drinks were great here. Their old fashion was one of the best I've had compared to other places. The service is slightly slow here but it doesn't seem to be the fault of the servers. It was a Saturday evening and so this is a bit expected. That said, if you're looking for a place with a fast and good service, this might not be it and you might need to have some patience. The servers will do their best as a group to take orders, bring drinks, bring dishes, and clean the table, but it might take some time.",

I ordered the Arizona Ramen. Maybe I was craving Ramen too much because I had not had it in some time, but the Ramen that I had was closer to a mexican soup. It was very thick, bland and even the avocado was not yet ripe to eat. Especially given the price, it was not worth it. My husband had the kimchi burger, it was just \"alright.\" We have had both of these fusion-type dishes often in LA, and have loved them. However, here it was not executed right. The saving grace was the srirachha, which we heavily poured in our dishes to try to enjoy them. The fries with the burger were good, but I would think twice before considering more complicating dishes.",

    "text": "I like to drink.  With such territory comes the eternal crossroads of either needing a solid libation, or something to soak up my now twisted and spinning reality.  With this being said, Clever Koi offers the best solutions to both of these predicaments.  Actually, I'll take that a step further - they offer both, at the same time.  I'm not talking cheap and satisfying \"you call it's\" and 2AM breakfast burritos that you hope the microwave killed off any and all of the handlers bacteria...let alone the syphilis growing in those ripened eggs.    No sir, this place is the bees knees.  My girlfriend's favorite date night spot.  Their cocktails are a symphony of flavors.  Kind of like Method Man's album \"Tical.\"  Their food?  Just stop.  Stop, Chef...I think Jared, I don't know, I'm usually drunk there.  You're too much.  It ain't right.  It ain't fair.  It ain't holy.  The Pork Ramen?  It's so good I think it ghost writes for Drake.  If anyone else tried to sell me a black bean & celery root pancake, I'd call in bomb threats from their mamas phone to the nearest Wal-Mart - no, AJ's (appeals to a broader elite) - until the cops circled the house of that breeder of such a limp-wristed individual.  But not this one.  Chef...we're sticking with Jared, has concocted something delicious in that dish.  I recommend it to the most savagely meat-headed of 'roided out individuals just to watch their reality crumble.  A lot of places try to rest on the laurels of hip decor and staff with nice beards.  Clever Koi takes both of these and says, hey man, we're pretty AND smart.  Know what I mean?  Roman is a dope bartender too.  Props on his Diamondbacks loyalty, cuz' they suck.  Know what doesn't suck though?  That guy.  I witnessed him a while back deal with two drunkards (more than myself, wow) at the bar top flashing all shades of unnecessary rudeness, like people tend to do when they're being served.  Handled it like the suave pro that he is.  They'll be back, I guarantee it.  Every week.  And it'll kill the staff slowly.  But hey, dolla dolla bills yo.  Plus, they're right next to George and Dragon.  Which offers really cheap rum and cokes, and jager bombs.  So when you're trying to drunkenly look for Pokemon with your girlfriend in Indian Steele park, you can walk right over from ze Koi, load up on cheap booze, and proceed to dodge the homeless denizens of the park.  If I had one knock on Clever Koi, now that I think about it, it'd be that they don't have jager.  Props to them for keeping it classy.  Their bathrooms are also more artistic than that hole you call a home.  Good brunch too.",

Entertaining as that may be perhaps save the fancy wood slat ceiling and put in something acoustic to absorb the sound of too many people in a small space.   Tried all the steam buns... Pretty good actually. Confused why it was called pineapple duck confit - - - Nothing confit about it, it was deep fried... Perhaps cooked confit but definitely was finished deep fried. Flavorless. Seriously disappointed. Not screwing around or exaggerating...we really really really were expecting something special based on all the talk about this place. I had braised short rib...hard to mess up right? They give chopsticks so you should be able to eat every dish with chopsticks. Wrong. So tough on the outside I had to bring in reinforcements and use chopsticks in one hand and fork in the other. It was a cute presentation of a hot meat over the top of a cold potato salad... Ya hot over cold.... Dumb not edgy. **If you want a \"wow factor\" short rib dish go try Beau McMillan's at Elements at Sanctuary....hot meat over hot side  Their cocktail menu is cool, creative... Probably what's keeping them alive since the bar was full, drinks were good, and the price was same as an entree.",

The food and service were okay, it certainly wasn't horrendous, but not good either. The ramen lacked depth in the broth. The most enjoyable items in it was the egg and the crispy pork belly. All the other components were mediocre. I do like the concept and the ambiance. Overall, I think this place is slightly overpriced for what you are getting.",

The moment you step in the doors, and meet the aroma, hear the sound of the open kitchen, (my favorite, I'm a sucker for open kitchens, and I'm excited to go back to sit around it.) cleaver Koi has been open for 6 years, and I witnessed the owner tasting items coming out of the kitchen, this is quality control at its best! He obviously cares, and it shows through every bite, and sip that we all took!  Service was top notch! Mary was a joy, she made sure every need at our table was met! Let's talk food! Yelpers here's a tip, check in, and receive a free steamed bun! The buns...OMG! We couldn't decide and went for the pork belly bun, it was so freakin good! I seriously can't wait to try all the others! The bun was like a soft pillow cradling the delectable pork belly, with a well balanced sweet and acidity, pure perfection! We ordered the pork belly ramen, lemon pepper chicken ramen, and the pad thai.  Every single item exceeded our expectation! Delicious!  We had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners, he was so engaging, it's no wonder why his restaurants are a success! By speaking with him, we learned he just opened up Fellow in South Scottsdale, which we had just dined at earlier this week! He also owns a sushi bar, Across The Pond, just across from Clever Koi, so excited to give that a try too! Even though we were completely stuffed, he offered us a complementary dessert for being first timers! We accepted the lovely offer, and somehow gobbled down 5 amazing banana foster doughnuts! I love a restaurant that makes you feel so special!  For those of you living in, or near Gilbert, you're in luck, Clever Koi just opened a location near you! (Although I'd drive across the country for one of those steamed buns!! I can't say enough about this restaurant and staff! The owners, chefs, front house, servers, to everything! I'm in love with Clever! If I could I would rate it 10 stars See you soon!",

    "text": "Edit: Within minutes of posting this review, the leadership at clever koi reached out to me privately and proactively extended solutions to ensure my future experiences would be much better. For this reason I'll be changing my review to a full 5 stars.   ------------------------------  I've been wanting to try this place forever. So I decided to dive in head first and go ahead on my birthday for an all in dinner experience.   Let's break down the review with the caveat that I did go in with high expectations.  Service-- Seated quickly, but took a while for initial contact from the server.  She was working hard, but it was painfully obvious she was working the entire floor by herself. Especially the overwhelming feeling of being rushed. I tried to order the meal in courses and take my time to enjoy my birthday, but she really wasn't having it- I don't know the whole story, but they should have given her more help. Despite all that, she was very nice and we tipped well.   (Side note) at one point during the night a person who's only job appeared to be filling up the water spilled on me because he was trying to squeeze past too quickly. I don't think he noticed but the back of my neck and shirt were wet for most of the night.   Food-- The food was good. We tried the confit wings, short rib dumplings, and pork ramen.  The wings were great. (Special props for having house made hot sauces)  Ramen was nothing to write home about, though. That's just my opinion though. I think I prefer thicker broth and noodles. The egg was perfectly poached, however.   My favorite of all being the short rib dumplings that could not have been more savory and made with care.   Drinks-- I ordered the 'summer nights' cocktail which, although slightly overpriced, was very easy to drink and made with a lot of care.  Atmosphere-- Busy, but really nice decor.  Overall-- -2 stars for short staffed and rushed experience.  A solid 3 stars for good food.  I need to go back and try it again now that there isn't so much personal birthday celebration pressure lol. Hopefully they'll have more staff to help out, too!",

The depth of flavor in this broth is plain ass stupid.  You literally could just drink the broth.  And please please please...get the banana balls for dessert. (Just do it.)",

    "text": "I've been here a few times to finally write a review.  I'd give this 5 stars except my recent experience with the hostess killed it for me.  Two adults looking for a bite to eat and no reservations on a Friday night, I expected it to be busy.  It sure was, we were told at least an hour wait.  So we spotted two seats at the bar and asked if the seats were taken.  She looked over and said, I can't see from where I'm at so I'm not sure if there are any, we are full.  We asked her again to look or verify as we can clearly see two spots but I wanted her to check.  She seemed annoyed and I was really surprised by the lack of attention on her part.  Another person came by and the hostess we were interacting with said something to her.  This new person looked back at the bar, walked over there and immediately returned with sure, let me get you both seated.  Something that the hostess should have done in the first place.  We also asked that if anyone else was waiting for a seat at the bar that they could take those seats and she said no, the rest of the individuals were waiting for a table.  Once we were seated it was smoothly from there.  Great food, gosh soooo good and excellent service from our server.  From where we were seated we could see how busy the kitchen was and how much food was going in and out.  Interacted with the chef and staff but tried not too distract them too much, we understand they are busy.  But overall great vibe and super nice.  I can't say enough about the food and drinks.  We also ordered a few speciality drinks and beers available. Great overall and recommend you head there early!",

My spouse wasn't as big of a fan because she felt it was a bit too fatty and noodle heavy. She loved her drink however.   In my opinion: if you love ramen, cocktails that are so delicious that there is art and love put into their creation and are okay with a potentially higher calorie dinner (have a light lunch in preparation) this place will blow your f$!ckin mind.   If you're looking for something less amazing and more calorie conscious, go to salad and go.",

Pork belly lacked a bit of flavor and there was nothing really memorable about the dish except for the soft boiled eggs. My girlfriend had the seafood hot pot I believe and it was good too. But for the price we paid, there was more to be expected from these dishes. Though I will say, the grilled squid was good, it had a nice chew to it and good flavor.

We had the KUSHIYAKI: Calamari  and the Tandoori Chicken, these delicious starters kicked the food party off right! The crab was cooked to perfection, very crispy and full of flavor. The Calamari was so EFFEN good!  My wife had the Spicy Seafood Hot Pot it was so good I was only given a small taste, but I couldn't blame her. I had the Salt & Pepper Crab.. If you don't try anything else as a seafood lover, try this!!!   We had this very attentive  (what we thought was a Bartender) assisting us while we were waiting, he asked us very detailed questions about our taste in booze, made suggestions based on the season of AZ, and ensured that we LOVED what he served us before walking away, and this awesome service was provided by one of the owners Nick! Now, if you don't find that small bit of our evening as EPIC customer service.. Please let me know of a place that the owner leads by that type of example. We'll be back but in a group setting very soon!",

You can build your own ramen, rice bowl and one other thing I can't remember. I had ramen. Ramen starts at $5. Meat option (no matter what you choose is $3). I subtracted 1 star bc I only got 2 pieces of pork belly. Where as, if you order steak for your ramen, you get a generous amount. I'm confused? $3 for 2 pieces of pork belly is a little steep. Pork belly was absolutely delicious and I wish I could've had more. Veggies were $1 each. Sides were extra $.50 like egg, kimchi, etc. How is a side of egg $.50 but like a couple of julienned carrot is $1? Oh.. I didn't order the carrots, but oh well. Now the broth, it's alright. I've had better at a ramen place in Tempe, but both can't compare to my ramen place in Chicago, but that's besides the point. I felt as if it was a little bland. Could've been slightly richer (for pork broth). The steak and lemongrass chicken were delicious though.   I ordered 1 appetizer. I can't remember the name, but it was fried, had Sriracha and kimchi. It was delicious. The drinks that were brought out to other customers looked soooo good, but I didn't order any. Customer service was great as well. Server was attentive. Establishment was very clean, including the bathroom.   Basically -2  bc some of the pricing didn't make any sense and flavoring of broth. Would I come again? Of course. I tend to give a place another try, unless service was absolutely herrendous.",

I love those things and was excited to try them   We started out with the chicken wings and they were super tasty ..sticky, meaty, and sweet & spicy.  We polished them off quickly, saving room for the next course   There are several versions of bao.  We took the plunge and decided to order them ALL!  All were delicious and many were vegetarian.  My favorite is the crispy tofu.   Soooooo yummy!  We couldn't leave without dessert....We ordered the bananas foster, Asian style   Again, completely delicious!  The cocktails were nicely crafted and fairly priced.  The building and actual restaurant are nicely lit and make great use of space   The bottom line is that the food is cravable, the service is great, and  the location is close by  so try it, you'll like it!!",

Probably because they think I'm talking about the twenty-five cent college stuff.   But no--this is a large bowl of pork broth with pork belly (I swear, it's just giant chunks of bacon. Don't be scared of the word \"belly\"), amazingly boiled noodles, a soft boiled egg, spices, crunchy veggies and deliciousness.   And don't get me started on their chicken and waffle steam buns. Or their pork belly steam buns. Or their rotation of tap beers. Or the steaming seafood hot pot. Literally ALL of it is delicious.  If you're looking for somewhere to go on a date night, or for happy hour, or lunch--look no further. Go to Clever Koi and understand what I'm talking about.",

The drinks were amazing, we got the bowl for 2, the appetizers were all incredible. We had a group of 10 and tried almost all of them and they were all better than the next! The entree was stellar and service to match, not to mention the price was very affordable. Top new spot, definitely will be back often!",

This is a new place that is still figuring out the finer points of service, but the one guy who brought me my drink and took my plates away (not sure re name) is a real winner.

We always heard great things about the restaurant and wanted to check it out.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted promptly with friendly welcoming energetic smiles.  The owner (Nick) knew it was a special occasion for us and went above and beyond. We started with two appetizers and specialty drinks with entrees to follow.I had one of the Tiki drinks which came out in a fun mug and tasted amazing! (let's just say they don't skimp you on the alcohol) I won't go into the specifics of what we ordered because that's not what matters to me, especially because every single dish truly tasted outstanding, unique and unforgettable.The flavor is truly astonishing! It will leave an impact on you that has you craving for more days later. Along with the amazing food I will remember the True passion Nick and the staff had. The few things I look for when going out is, great food, aumbiance and good service. The Clever Koi, has all of this and more, thank you so much for providing us both with a unforgettable, unique, fun evening! We will see you all again soon!  Cheers",

I prefer sitting outside because of the nice breeze from the high fans. You can also hear the light rail and few cars pass but overall its not too loud and just right. Inside of the restaurant  has a good touch up of trendy Asian interior. I find the place just perfect.   We ordered the calamari fries which was very good! It was tasty with a nice hint of lime.  You can actually taste the calamari unlike other restaurants where you can mostly taste what its breaded in rather than the calamari itself. I tried something new and ordered the spicy seafood hot pot. The broth was savory and the spice was just right with thick udon noodles.   We got the same server as last time and as usual service was outstanding. He was very informative with every questions we had about the menu. He checked up on us a couple times and ensured everything was good. Our server was friendly and gave us good suggestions on what to order.   Clever Koi is hidden but definitely worth the place to be checked out if you want to try something new. It's a great restaurant.",

The music is good and just loud enough so you can have a private conversation at your table without anyone else overhearing it even though the tables are close.    The food is outstanding and the menu is unique.  I really enjoy the soft boiled egg on just about every meal.   Lunch is a smaller menu but quick and wonderful.   Dinner is even better.

It only seats 85 but I can't see fitting more than 60. It's tiny.   We were seated and then greeted right away. Menus were brought but, due to the crowded place, drinks weren't requested for another 10-15. We got a glass of wine, two beers, a Pellegrino and a coke. We also ordered the crudites and Peking Duck Croquettes at the same time, since it was a slow start.   The croquettes were excellent, with savory, crunchy exteriors and flavorful interior. The crudites were average. It had beets, fennel, carrots, snap peas, asparagus and radishes with a tzaziki sauce. The veggies were just too boring with no seasoning.   For entrees we ordered the Mushroom ramen (2),  Chow mien, Pork ramen, Thai beef and a Seafood Hot Pot (mine).  The ramen were well received by my table mates. I tasted the chow mien and the beef was tasty but the noodles were very bland, with no saucy flavors. My hot pot was okay. It had fish, scallops and shrimp. The fish was excellent and the shrimp, aside from being over cooked, was good. The scallops were 1/4\" small so virtually no flavor there. The broth was hot but really had no body to it. Decent flavor but it missed the mark.   The vibe at Clever Koi is enough to bring me back. Our server, albeit a little slow, did his best. Try it and order the croquettes!",

Then when we wanted to close out, not only did I have to flag down our server, but then waited another 10 minutes for her to close the card out. To the point that we had to stand up as if we were leaving for her to bring our card back.

It's a little loud if you choose to sit on the patio, bit the ambiance inside is perfect, intimate enough for a date night but also good for meeting with friends. I've never had any issues with the service here, either.",

Their tuna chips and chicken wings are also good.  I also like the vibe in Clever Koi. I got to speak with one of the young owners. Very friendly. Highly recommending this place if you want something Asian with the LA vibe.",

    "text": "Clever Koi is a phoenix treasure.  The menu is an Asian fusion that is unique to Arizona.  The kitchen is open behind the counter.  Sit at the counter and watch the kitchen staff in motion with the chef orchestrating the event.  The food is very good and the menu is well thought out and unique.  The signature cocktails are on point and unique.  Decent beer selection.  A good time is always had at this spot with a great atmosphere.  I'm taking away 1 star because of the hostess, she was less than welcoming when we arrived.  She said it would be an hour wait meanwhile I could obviously see two seats at the open seating bar.  I asked if we could sit at the bar and she said there are no seats.  I replied that I could clearly see two seats and we would like to sit there.  She seemed annoyed but we were eventually sat there.  Let me say everything else about our visit was outstanding, our server was great, the staff (minus the rude hostess) was great, food and drinks were great.  A warm greeting would have made a five star visit, too bad the hostess was so rude.  One poor staff member can spoil the overall experience.",

    "text": "Had dinner here after reading your reviews and you didn't disappoint. The place is small but spacious enough for me to maneuver around. The chairs are sturdy enough and large enough to hold my obese body comfortably during dinner. So let's get to the food!  We started with a side of wings and an order of brussels sprouts. The wings have a bite that burned long after several chugs of water and lemonade, but they were GOOD!! The sprouts are covered in a thick sauce and have chunks of meat (I believe it's sausage) that are well-seasoned and delicious.   The soft shell crab bun was surprisingly bland, but it was crispy. The pork belly bun was fried hard. I was expecting it to be tender and chewy. Regardless, it didn't stop me from wishing I had three more. Just imagine crispy, lightly salted bacon wrapped in a fluffy tortilla and you're there!  I also had the tuna chips, something I'd never heard or seen before. It was pretty good: flakes of white paper-thin crunchy things with a dollop of guacamole and several small chunks of tuna dispersed throughout. I'm glad to have experienced it, but will probably not order it again on my next visit.  The seafood XO noodles qualify as a Last Meal request, I promise you, they're that good! Mike, our server was super attentive and awesome. I'm gonna start a GoFundMe account so I can eat here every month!",

The lunch hour specials are for Eat-In only. Our bad! We didn't know this. The egg was a bit undercooked. We were charged $0.25 for utensils and $0.50 for sriracha as the order was to go which even though it was only $0.75 was kind of a downer They didn't give us the option; it was just an automatic charge.   Service was ok. The hostess/cashier was nice but not particularly friendly but I can understand her reasoning why since, in all honesty, I made a comment about the small item charge. She didn't thank us for coming in, probably because she was on the phone, but still we would have appreciated an acknowledgement of some sort as we left.",

    "text": "This place is really nice. I came here with my wife for a casual dinner on Wednesday night. We did not have a reservation but were lucky enough to grab two spots at the bar.   The bartenders were friendly and the drink menu was well edited. I had a whiskey cocktail which was great - I cannot remember the name but the toasted lemon juice was a thoughtful and sophisticated pop of flavor.   We ordered the sticky buns (chicken and waffle, stone crab, and cauliflower) and they were great as an appetizer. Each one of these is a perfect snack for one or you can easily knife them into two tasteful servings.   For dinner we had curry duck bowl and it was very very well done. The sauce was savory but not thick, and the spice was packing a good amount of heat without being overwhelming. If you're not a fan of spicy at all, this may not be the dish for you, but if you like a well done dose of curry heat, you really can't beat this.   I have been to this place a handful of times and have always had good experiences, however tonight's ambiance and food (and the enjoyment of my wife) led me want to commend them. Well done!  Side note - if you go for lunch their Banh Mi sand which is delicious.",

That being said I did go back here because I thought it was so good. And hats off to whoever picked the Riesling on the menu- it pared magically with the dishes.",

    "text": "Straight up reviewing based on drinks and their vegan options ... I've been twice to this Central location and they knock it out of the park each time.  Had the root vegetable puree appetizer that comes with scallion pancakes. A bit salty, but it is an addictive flavor and I love those pickled onions.  Had the Arizona ramen and really enjoyed the flavor and textures.  The nopales in the ramen is definitely the highlight with how they've roasted it before it goes in the soup. I've also had the Dan Dan noodle dish which comes with Impossible meat, and it might be one of my favorite dishes in Phoenix.  Super savory (again, a touch on the salty side) with those peanuts and Impossible meat.  The roasted veggies and noodles are both cooked to perfection.  Two people can easily share, and maybe even have leftovers.  Cocktails and wine that I've had here are also good. They even sampled one of the wines I was on the fence about, which I thought was nice and isn't always an option.  The bartenders and the wait staff were super friendly.  Its a clean place, with a fun vibe.  Wait times can get long so I recommend getting there a little early if you have more than 2 in your party.  Sitting at the bar is also an option.  OH! And they have daily happy hour, so take advantage of the savings on apps and drinks during that time. =)",

The noodles were chewy and not very authentic tasting but the pork belly was really good.  Could have used some different textures in it but it was ok overall.  I will come back here, not a lot of other choices around it but it has great service and wonderful flavors.  KT",

ALL. THE. THINGS. In fact, this is how we'll request it from now on.  - Riding the Pine cocktail was excellent. - The Short Rib Appetizer was delicious too.

The Clever Koi is more akin to a Picasso than a classic masterpiece it will offer you a culinary journey with some high notes and some lower. So if you are more of a California roll and Maggie broth ramen this might not be the place for you. Give this place a chance keep an open mind and I hope just like me you can look forward to coming back to know what the menu will challenge you with.

I recommend the pot roast dumplings and the lemon pepper chicken noodle soup. The flavors were balanced and intricate, and I would certainly come here again if I lived here. Great cocktails. The ONLY pet peeve: I could taste the dish detergent on the drinks and the water (my husband couldn't). But the cocktail list was inventive and I'd love to try them all! On a side note, I liked the wall art in the bathroom.",

We only tried one I suggest all 3 in fact i would try all 3 and pass on the dumplings unless you have a huge appetite in which case do both but if you have to pick I'd do buns over dumplings. The ramen is very popular. It's not my cup of tea so I can't say it was to die for but the pork belly one is their most popular so we got it and it was fine but again not something I'm that in to so it tasted good but I wish we would have gotten the pad Thai with shrimp personally. Another thing I didn't get to try and wish I would have is the kimchi fried rice. Definitely will do that next time. And then their dessert menu only has 2 items there is a butter cake which wasn't worth it and then beignets which I didn't have but would try next time as well.",

    "text": "A place so nice I came here twice...well three times within a week. This is the type of place you want bring your friends and loved ones to. I've come here for lunch and dinner.  It's also vegetarian friendly.   Ambience: attracts lots of different groups from business professionals to students to hipsters.   Service: very prompt, friendly, and knowledgable about the menu and drink items. I've had nothing but great service here.   Lunch: limited menu which kind of stinks but they make it pretty fast. You get to customize your own bowl a la chipotle and they have their delicious fritters available for dessert. I think the fried rice bowl is my favorite but you can do chow mein, soba, udon or ramen.   Dinner: the best time to come. Our waiter told us that he recommends everyone order something different so ppl can taste everything. We ordered the dumplings, seafood soup, crab steamed buns, cauliflower ramen, and the lemongrass chicken ramen. My personal favorites were the crab steamed buns and cauliflower ramen, but they were all delicious. The steamed buns are a HOME RUN. I can't imagine anything disappointing here.   Price: decently priced, the steamed buns are a little expensive but they're so good that $4 seems like a steal.",

I received good suggestion on the drinks and food. I tried the Aviator drink which was very good, loved it!  The location was small and modern we were seated in the patio. It was late on Saturday night and there was a cool breeze which made it comfortable eating environment.  The food was tasty, I tried the steam bun: Pork Belly, Waffles and Chicken and Soft Shell Crab. Each was original in flavor.  I also had the Shrimp and Scallop Dumplings they were delicious. My boys tried the Pork Roman noodle. They liked the noodles but were not big fans of the pork belly. Teens can't always please them. My husband and daughter had the Spicey Seafood Hot Pot. They were both pleased with the flavor and spiciness.  We shall return to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Despite what its name implies, at least what I thought I'd be getting, The Clever Koi in downtown Phoenix does not serve sushi. It does, however, serve really tasty Asian noodle and rice dishes, and I was pleasantly surprised to love my meal even though I usually am only a Thai and sushi fan when it comes to Asian eats.  The hip spot has a patio overlooking Central Avenue, with the \"dings\" of the light rail creating the soundtrack to your dining experience if you choose to sit outside - which I love doing. Inside, an open kitchen and bar complements a bustling atmosphere with tables in cozy confines that make neighboring diners your friends.  My pal and I took advantage of the $30 special, which came with a jug of spiked punch, a fruity concoction made with Japanese rice wine, pineapple juice and other fruit flavors. I could tell by my buzz it was strong, but you wouldn't be able to tell by the sweet flavor of the drink, which was refreshing and delicious.  It was the perfect way to cool off the palate during my meal of vegetable chow mein, which was very filling with a ton of noodles and veggies. I loved the house-made sriracha sauce and also added soy sauce. I cleaned up my bowl, no problem. My only disappointment was I wasn't able to take advantage of the gluten-free noodles in my dish - our server said with the veggie chow mein, that wasn't an option.  My pal got tofu fried rice, which he also enjoyed and ended up taking half of it home - his portion was also very generous, so I guess I was just hungrier. Our server said the tofu is marinated, which makes it extra flavorful, and my pal agreed.  The staff was really friendly, but it was a bummer it took about 10 minutes to get hot sauce and soy sauce after our food was delivered. Other than that, the happening spot had an energizing atmosphere and made me like Asian food more than I ever thought I would.",

I had the udon noodles with pork belly and pork broth, the wife had shrimp and dashi on udon.  The pork was fried but maybe a bit too much as it was getting stuck to my teeth, it was good otherwise, I would probably not have broth the next time or maybe ask for less of it, as it is difficult to eat that much food and then try to eat all the broth. The udon noodles were very well made and just the right amount of chewy.  I had their pork steamed buns which is served more like a taco, it was very good especially with their in house made sriracha.   My wife enjoyed her food but also could not finish the broth.  A lot of millennial's work here some of them can't put their phones away.  The music could have been turned down a little bit. I don't go to restaurants for music I go for food.",

The Ramen has chunks of pork and pieces of pork belly and the broth was rich and tasty, it was decadent to say the least. The sandwich was good as well and comes with a fresh fruity salad that would be great on a home summer day. You can get the fries with It if that is more to your liking. The only negative with the sandwich is there wasn't enough dikan, carrots and cucumber to our liking.  I tried a draft of the Strawberry Blonde on tap and it was phenomenal, they have a wide variety of cocktails. The next time I visit I will be sure to find time to visit Clever Koi again!",

You find a restaurant with lots of good reviews, go there with high hopes, try many things from the menu, and be surprised to find that none of the dishes are that good.   The Sriracha chicken wing was so tiny and totally lacking any kick or flavor.   Pork belly and soft shell crab buns were the most decent items in our meal, but still nothing to write home about.    The major disappointment was our main dishes.   My wife had Crispy Pineapple Duck which was so dry and hard.   I had Tamarind Mole Short Rib and I must say it was the most flavorless short rib I ever had.   Their menu looks creative and we thought our taste buds will be in for a great treat, but there was none of that....",

The drink prices are definitely affordable and the best part is the $5 menu.  Where else can you get such a tasty little snack/lunch on a Sat afternoon? And it was not super packed so it made the exp that much nicer that I could actually hear the person talking across from me. We ordered the roasted asian beet salad and the chicken wings.  The salad was OMG amazing. For that price?? You must be kidding. Golden beets, tempura bean curd, fresh mizuna (no one has this btw), cucumber, and a lemongrass vin... so delicious for 5 bucks  And the wings, great flavor! The chili sauce was fantastic... however, i do happen to be a VERY picky wing eater. i am one of the harshest critics on wings... they were a little underdone and kinda soggy. So... note to the chef  All in all though I will be back :)",

The inside of the place looked pretty cool and had a well stocked bar. We got here around lunch time so we were given a piece of paper and you basically build your own bowl. Starting with noodles or rice and then going to pick meats and vegetables. Our bowls were ok, nothing crazy spectacular but they were not lacking flavor either. The real treat were the pork belly steamed buns! They were delicious! A place I would come back to visit for some appetizers and drinks on a night when there's nothing else to do.",

    "text": "The Clever Koi serves great noodle dishes that are not as heavy as its traditional counterparts. The broth served at the Clever Koi is not the traditional Tonkotsu broth one might expect at a noodle establishment, but that is what sets The Clever Koi apart. A feature worth writing home about is the Build-Your-Own-Bowl. Here, TKC allows diners to customize his or her noodle or rice bowls. Diners can choose noodle, broth, protein, and vegetable fixings to create his or her own magical Clever-Koi-Creation. The end creation is filling but, by no means, heavy. The veggies are crisp, the broth is light, which when combined allowed me to enjoy a bowl of udon/ramen noodles without having to sacrifice 30 minutes of my afternoon to nap.   Have a hankering for asian soup noodles but want to feel a little healthy while consuming it? COME HERE.  Although I usually don't include notes on atmosphere, TKC has great scene. I would sum it up as Zen vibe with modern fixtures. I enjoy the dark metals and wood pieces. I feel like West Elm outfitted the establishment. Additionally, its worth to note that parking is located behind the building. If you are coming down Central Ave,turn into the street right before TKC and you should see a parking lot.   4 stars = I'm a fan. I refrained from giving 5 stars because the service was sub-par. Did I come at an off time? Was the girl who served my party our dishes having a bad day?? IDK, but icky vibes can really affect one's dining experience.",

My recommendations are tuna chips\" Must order\", pig face dumplings (\"scary name but amazing taste if you love spicy\"), pork belly buns and pineapple duck rice (\"delicious\")! I recommend ramen and XO yakisoba noodles. My favorite spot to sit is by the bar cause I can watch barista make his crafted cocktails , it's quite an art! The only thing I did not enjoy as much is dessert. Although each plate looks esthetically pretty , bth desserts I have tasted were plain and too fried (they were not in menu but I posted a picture of one) Not my favorite. Also, quick recommendation for staff working by grill to smile a little! Definitely recommend this place for cocktails and food! Will be there soon to taste ramen!",

Highly recommend the sriracha wings, and the soft shell crab steamed buns, the mushroom dumplings and the tuna chips. Amazing. The drinks were wonderful- had something called the drink formerly known as spritz, and it was awesome- strawberry aperol and sauvignon blanc, and lemon juice. Delicious.  We were one of those groups that of course paid with about five or six different credit cards, and the staff was so patient with us and accommodating. I wish I could remember our server's name, but she was wonderful, and funny, and thoughtful. They had a new menu and it is worth a trip. Nothing beats the service there. Don't miss out!",

PROS Pig face dumplings! Juicy, crispy on the bottom and the table was a fan of the spicy kimchi. The Kobe app - very tasty with the mushrooms, super buttery protein and cooked just right. My friend liked her forbidden rice dish, she didn't get any protein with it just veggies, she esp liked the bok choy I ordered the crispy duck, delish rice cake and pineapple puree as the sauce, veggies were just how I liked that all charred but still crunchy  CONS I ordered a glass of the Tempranillo, server came back and gave me other options.  Banana fritters were not really fritters, they were more donut holes/beignet style, it could have been cooked a little more, too gooey for me Skimped on sauces in the dishes  We enjoyed our meal and our time at Clever Koi, we look forward to trying their HH if we are in the area.",

My husband and I both tried their pork belly ramen and their pork belly steamed bun... the steamed bun is a must try!!! You definitely won't regret it. The ramen was good and the broth was pretty great, but what I would change is removing the kimchi and changing the fried pork belly to a steamed pork belly that melts in your mouth. The kimchi just didn't belong. That would have made their ramen the best ramen I've ever had if those changes were made. I also tried their Thai basil cocktail (Thai basil, gin, lime juice and simple syrup) and it's probably the best Thai basil cocktail I've ever had.   Great and friendly service-- we'll definitely be coming back!",

The menu is really fun, you can choose to have ramen, rice, and many other options for your base, if having soup even choose your broth, then your protein, and lastly your veggies.   I ordered a ramen bowl, pork broth, duck, and a couple veggies. My friend had a ramen bowl as well with steak and veggies. She also ordered the chicken and waffle app which was small for the price, one piece, but she enjoyed it.  Overall the food was amazing, the duck was dark meat, broth was full of flavor, and the bowl was huge however the price is a bit much for what your getting and it took 30 min or so to receive our entree however I was informed everything is made fresh including the meats so that may be part of it.",

We had the Softshell Crab, Short Rib Dumplings, Kimchi Fried Rice with duck, and Pork Belly Ramen. All exceeded our expectations. Cutting into the crab and having it just ooze bright white, juicy meat was so satisfying. It had the beautiful taste of the sea that told you how fresh it was.   Everything was great. We were lucky enough to sit at the bar looking into the kitchen, our own personal chef's table. The cook working the fry station was super nice and engaged with us.

    "text": "It occurred to me today that I have never written a review of this place and I've been coming here semi-regularly for the last two years! Let me just say, if I could give the Clever Koi a hug, I would but my arms just aren't long enough. As an Asian American, the term \"Asian fusion\" tends to give me pause. But the guys who run this place know what they are doing. The food is almost always excellent or near excellent. I feel Clever Koi deserves five stars because they add new menu items with the seasons. The penchant for experimentation shows a restaurant that doesn't rest on its laurels.  Of their permanent items, I like their version of \"chips and guacamole\" which is shrimp chips, tuna and avocado with a bit of wasabi. Their baos are also tasty, especially the soft shell crab and chicken. They are close to authentic bao. As for seasonal items, tonight I had a persimmon beet tart in a matcha puff pastry that was just out of this world. I also had black vinegar ribs that were pretty tender. For the level of creativity and sophistication, I think their prices are absolutely fair. I'm sure if they were in Chicago or New York, everything would be a lot more expensive.   The icing on the cake is the hospitality. I like to bring my friend's dog to their dog-friendly patio. Then the dog got sick and was really wobbly when we went. We weren't sure if she was going to recover. One of the owners felt so bad, that he had a saucer of chicken brought out for her. And these weren't chicken scraps but nicely chopped pieces that had been cooked in lemongrass. Penny did recover and the co-owner has never forgotten about her and still occasionally brings her some chicken. ;)   This is the kind of place that I would take out of town guests to. The delicious food and the modern atmosphere make this place on par with any restaurant in NY or LA. I'm such a loyal customer now that they could accidentally set my clothes on fire and I would write it off as just an off day. Not that they would ever do that!",

The only thing was I didn't care for the gastrique.  It left an odd taste in my mouth.   The pig face Kimchi dumplings were awesome. Melt in your mouth.   Also tried the Chow Mein with duck. It was a step up from other Chow Mein that I've had.   Also ordered a Manhattan which was made well.  Nice smooth drink.  Still gave it 5 stars for the service and ambiance.

RaeAnn was very nice and had great recommendations. Overall I'd say it was worth the $80.00 and I will continue being a regular. Best old fashion in town btw!",

    "text": "This place has some very unique flavor combinations for Asian fusion. There was hints of Asian flavors that reminded me of home but also some new aromas that complimented the food really well. Many of the dishes are spicy, which I didn't realized until after we got it to our table. So if your sensitive to spice then you may want to check with you waiter. In order to get a tasting of different dishes we ordered several plates and shared them all. We started off with a tempura catfish steamed bun, very light in flavor but had a very good sauce. We then tried the rabbit gyoza and pig face dumplings. The rabbit gyoza was greasy but the pickled carrots were a really good compliment with them - making them taste fantastic. The pig face dumplings were very good, it had some of their house made red siracha which made them a little spicy. We also tried the wok fried brussel sprouts, which were interesting because the first few bites reminded me of an Asian wok fried vegetable but them the peppery smoky aftertaste makes me forget I'm having brussel sprouts. We also had the duck curry, which for our taste was too spicy and we weren't able to get past bite number two. It started out very delicious but the heat from the spice was too much and numbing that I couldn't taste anything after.   Lastly, we tried a cranberry cake with sesame basil ice cream, which delicious. The basil and sesame were very light and complimented the warm sweet cake. Overall, everything was tasty but wished we would've know which dishes were spicy and which were not.",

    "text": "I'm a little torn on this place.  My fiancee really enjoyed it, but to me it was ok.  I am a little bias cause I do come from a Asian family and we owned a family restaurant, so this Asian fusion is a little confusing to me.  The place had a nice environment and \"trendy\" but it's still all about the food.  I thought for the prices of the food, they sure do give very small portions.  If I told my parent's I paid over 14.00 for ramen, they would probably slap me!  I much rather have a big bowl of Pho that costs me 8 bucks, than the ramen that I had at Clever Koi. I ordered the Pork Ramen, which had two peices of pork belly, an egg, and some veggies, with very little ramen. The good thing is most of the food was flavorful and delicious, but just very small portions.   The service was good, we sat in the patio, cause inside seating was over 45 minutes long!  So we sat outside with another couple.  We split couple of appetizzers and buns, and each order a ramen dish.  With couple of drinks, the bill came out to over 120.00.  The sad part is when we left, I told my lady I am still hungry, not just a little but a lot.  I felt I could eat another meal, so on the way home we stopped and picked up a Sonoran Dog and called it a night.  Overall, this place was pretty good and had flavorful food, but for those prices, I rather go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Good but not good enough for us to want to return. My husband and I had been scouring yelp to find an amazing restaurant for our anniversary and stumbled upon this place due to the reviews. Located in a really cool building with lots of rustic wood and glass displaying the kitchen and dining area. I loved the \"sushi bar-esque\" seating in front of the kitchen where you could literally watch them making your food. I had such high hopes upon reading rave reviews and arriving at this place but the food and service did not back up the aesthetics.  We were told to wait upon arrival because they needed to \"reorganize\", even though there were plenty of open tables. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated without being offered a menu or drinks. When another couple came in and was immediately seated I asked why we were skipped and she said they had a reservation and she was just about to seat us anyways, coincidentally. Would be nice if their website advertised/allotted reservations so I could have done the same. Not one time while we were waiting though did I see any \"reorganizing\", or moving of tables in the dining room.  Upon being seated we were handed menus and I have to say there was a great variety of dishes on the menu that you don't see often. Pig face dumplings and steamed bun assortments.  That was exciting. I ordered the Tofu soft bun and my husband ordered the Softshell Crab and the Pork Belly buns. As we went to pick our buns up from their holders, the outsides of the buns were stuck! Most of it was torn and stuck to the holders which was disappointing. Maybe lightly oiling the holders or having non stick holders in the future would prevent losing some of your bun. Overall good flavor and definitely the highlight of the whole meal. I would almost suggest ordering a variety of those as your meal, asian taco style.  Main entrees consisted of the Roasted corn Ramen for myself and the Seafood Hot Pot for my husband along with plenty of their handcrafted cocktails. 2 bartenders for the whole restaurant was probably not the best idea. We waited a long time for drinks, 15 minutes or more sometimes and thats only because we had to flag down our waitress whom looked a bit lost. It was confusing as well because almost every item was brought by a different waiter/waitress which made it hard to connect with our own server.  Roasted Corn Ramen was rich and creamy with great extraction of corn flavor.Just wish they had either allowed me to add the tempura corn on my own or left it to be plated on top last minute because it was really mushy in the ramen once it reached me and lost all of its crispy crunch.  Seafood Hot Pot was lacking in seafood. You can't call something seafood and only put out 2 types of seafood. They should call it shrimp and octopus ramen. Thats what it was. Flavor was there though and the homemade srirachas were a great touch.   All in all it was good, not great, no hard feelings but they should focus more on the basics than what will look cool and different.",

Inside is so, very eye pleasing lots of complimentary colors bar is close to the wok action/kitchen smaller than I expected but seating was all arranged nicely. Let's talk about the food, it was happy hour read some reviews known for their cocktails I liked how they have a special well gin and tonic which is my favorite very refreshing get it if you like gin! Got the Spicy tuna chips well played and tasted even delicious I also ordered the vegetable kimchi fried rice with tofu! Awesome everything was to a T! Service was wonderful the GM/ Owner was on grounds making sure everything was right and even asked us how our food was, which is awesome the hostess then became waiter was cool!

When I want Ramen I generally go to Umami in Tempe but if I'm working at my desk I can't always drive over there. So I tried Clever Koi.  My first round with CK was pork based broth and ramen noodles. It was OK, not amazing, the broth had a unique flavor and the order of Sriracha I got with it, helped pump up the flavor.  The second round I ordered Dashi broth and udon noodles with mushrooms, snow peas and shrimp. The shrimp and mushrooms tasted off. Like the mushrooms were canned and the shrimp should've been served yesterday. Everything was incredibly bland, it lacked in any seasoning and I had to add salt to the entire dish to even get anything to pop. This time I didn't order Sriracha and I really should have. I had a small packet of Cholula in my desk and added that to the soup and it helped. I had a co-worker order a rice bowl with the lemongrass chicken and she said it was \"two thumbs up.\" So maybe if you're looking for a rice bowl hit up Clever Koi, but I've officially called off the soup orders from them.",

I appreciate the enthusiasm of the chefs who are trying their hands at being innovative with their cuisine. There is definitely a wide variety on their menu and I am sure everyone should find something that will satisfy their palette.  We started with a drink which decent but nothing memorable there, esp. since despite our request to add one large cube of ice the bartender just added a lot of small cubes which diluted the drink in minutes before the server could help.   My top fav dishes here were the tuna chips a must try. I loved the crunchy thin rice crisps and the fresh crudo tuna, the wasabi guacamole was a nice finishing touch. The trick is to eat this quickly as the rice paper chips tend to get soggy by the end. The second dish that came close to this was the soft shell crab steamed bun very delectable indeed.    Why the three star review then ... this truly is a 3.5 star place the .5 for our server who was helpful and gave some nice recommendations. The food though disappointed after the dishes mentioned above, the chicken n waffle was the prime reason for the lower rating my husband loved chicken and absolutely never complains about it unless it's really bad, he simply hated the crispy chicken thigh so u tried it it was definitely overdone. Dry and chewy. The second dish that completely disappointed was the roasted mushroom dumplings ... the filling had no flavors whatsoever and they were also over cooked, I am not sure if this was the only time good was over cooked or it was supposed to be like this as the place wasn't too crowded when we were here.   The spicy seafood hot pot was ok but I love ramen ... like really love ramen and any kind of noodle soups. This one just didn't hit the mark, the broth was interesting but slightly heavy on the gochujang which masked other subtle flavors if an  Tip: Bonus they have a daily happy hour menu till 6pm.",

For dinner I had the steam bun with crab, short rib appetizer, and the pork belly ramen bowl. So for me I love short ribs and pork belly, and I just wasn't impressed with either. The short ribs were a little too sweet for me, they tasted really sugary (which I'm sure some people love but not necessarily my thing). They were super thin slices and a little pricey for the portion. The steam but was free with yelp check-in, my friend liked it a lot. I had a little taste and the flavor was really good there.  The pork belly was okay but didn't wow me by any means, but mainly I just didn't love the flavor of the ramen broth. I ate the pork belly and a few noodles and just left the rest.  Overall, it's a super cute ambiance. I love the outdoor seating... but the food didn't necessarily leave me wanting to come back a second time.",

Sadly, I would not order again.  BANANA FRITTERS- I thought it would be more of a warm soft creamy banana inside....but looked and tasted more spongy than anything. The caramel sauce it came with was watered down and out of place...too much sugar overall. Since the fritters are covered in sugar already.  CRISPY PINEAPPLE DUCK- it was really dry, hard to chew. It was overcooked for sure. I wouldn't order again. SOFT SHELL CRAB STEAM BUN- very sour, because of the sauce that's in it. If it was just the soft shell crab, it wouldve been great.  GALBI SHORT RIB- I wish it were more moist with sauce. It was tough, I felt like it was overcooked.   Service: Superb! There was a waiter specifically to refill your water glass, and clean your table. Very nice gentlemen, quick and on point with service!   Atmosphere: Romantic and Instagram trendy, love it!",

Reservations are available so if you're looking to get seating for a bigger group keep in mind there's that option to book beforehand.   They had free bun check in when I went - not sure how long this promotion will last. Everyone at the table ordered different buns but were all satisfied by them. I personally tried the soft shell crab one and I enjoyed it. One thing to note if you're allergic to shellfish of any sort they fry the pork belly in the same oil. The servers were pretty attentive to this since we had someone at the table who was allergic. They ended up giving us more buns than ordered!  I got the pork belly ramen. I wasn't all that impressed - the broth wasn't flavorful. For 15$ it came with soft boil egg, bean sprouts, pork belly, nori, and green onions. Portion size was reasonable, but more flavoring would be preferred. Coworker got the shaken beef - apparently that's where it's at.  While the poor waitress were running around to make sure we were still okay due to the shellfish fiasco. She ended up giving us dessert for free. Very good service so that's always a plus.",

    "text": "On my last night in Arizona, three of my friends and I decided to check out a local ramen place. Two of my friends are locals, and they have a spot they typically go to, however the drive was a bit further from the airport - I was catching a flight fairly soon.  I did some searching and found this ramen joint called \"The Clever Koi\".  The restaurant's interior was all glass, the store front came with a patio, surrounded by plants and was dimly lit lighting which made the area cozy. There were low hanging light fixtures that added a rustic charm to the inside. The table was intimately set with a candle and some cutlery wrapped in table napkins - not typically of a ramen restaurant.  They have a minimal menu, not much food to choose from which I found kind of delightful as having way too much food options can be overwhelming. They also have a Vegan friendly section to the menu which one of my friends opted for, Vegan Pad Thai.  We started off with the Calamari Fries for our table. The calamari had a crispy exterior and tender inside, seasoned well and is complimented by the dipping sauce, all in all an appetizer that would make you go \"DDDAAAAAMMMNNN!\" After your first bite.  FUN FACT:  When you check in on Yelp you get a free steamed bun! I ordered the Pork Belly. The pork was crisp and the fat to meat ratio was perfect for the size of the bun. It was seasoned well. The sauce and bun were absolutely delicious.  Now on to the Main:  Three of us all ordered the Pork Ramen.  When the food arrived, I immediately noticed the well presented dishes, considering it was a bowl of soup and noodles. The first tried the broth, it tasted clean and beefy, and the kimchi added a bit of a vinegary taste and spice to the dish - this did not taste like your traditional ramen. However the flavour profile was orgasmic in my opinion. The ramen noodles was tender and cooked to perfection. The crispy pork belly and the carnitas in my ramen was so flavorful my mouth is salivating as I type this. It also had an egg which balanced out all the flavours.   Definitely a gem in my opinion. Again it may not be traditional but the fusion of this dish was certainly well crafted. A great way to end my last day of my vacation, oh yeah I forgot to mention our server was awesome - I did not get a chance to get her name but she was bad ass ;)  PS try the Sake if you wanna get a little tipsy while having your dinner :)",

The spring rolls were very good. The kiwi added a unique flavor. The peanut sauce was exceptional.

    "text": "Every great restaurant deserves a great review; especially if you're here every other week. It would be more often if I didn't feel so weird about being their all the time.   Let me start with the staff - they freaking rock. Every single person is absolutely amazing. Cool vibes. You have a server, but all too frequently you'll see that everyone's helping everyone out.   The ambiance? Perfection. I love how the restaurant isn't too big. It's always hustling and bustling. You can sit on the cute green patio, the dining area, or at either of the bars - one by the bar or the one in front of the kitchen. Both are stellar.   The drinks? Can I just say ? They're beautiful. ALWAYS perfect. Extremely unique and tasty. I always order the Moscow Mule. You're probably thinking that's easy you can't mess that up, but trust me you can. Not only are they not messing it up, but it's actually the best Mule I've ever had.   Last but not least, the food. Where the begin? We've probably tried almost everything on the menu, but I order the same thing everytime because I'm obsessed. I live for the tuna chips. You have to try it!!!!!!! Always get the pork belly and soft shell crab steamed buns. Yummmm! Not kidding. Short rib dumplings...say no more. Oh and I guess it's entree time, which at this point I'm pretty full, however I order anyways. My go-to is the kimchi fried rice with pork belly and EXTRA pork belly. Try it you will not be disappointed.   You're welcome, but please let me know when you're going because I'd rather not have to wait too long",

I came in to the Clever koi and was greeted immediately by the friendly staff. I sat in the bar and when I was asked if I would like to order anything to eat, I mention that I wasn't really hungry and I asked for Recommendations. The bar tender recommended the black bean pancakes, so I ask for those.  They where obviously not what I was expecting as they don't look anything like a pancake but they taste really really good they are vegetarian. I am looking forward on bringing my family next time.",

We were seated on the outdoor patio on a particularly beautiful night, and the twinkly lights and abundance of plants around the patio made it very inviting and comfortable. We got the shumai dumpling appetizer, at the urging of the waiter, and it was ok. I dont' think it was hype-worthy... it definitely tasted like frozen dumplings that were heated up and doused in sauce. Not bad, but nothing authentic... although, I guess people don't come to Clever Koi expecting super authentic Asian food. The shaking beef appetizer was really enjoyable, with large chunks of tender beef and bright, acidic tomato and arugula with yuzu vinaigrette to balance out the meat and rice. We also tried out the XO noodles, which were a tad bit spicy and kind of just tasted like your average yakisoba noodles. Nothing to write home about. Overall, while I didn't find the Asian fusion food particularly spectacular, I think Clever Koi is really cute inside, and would be a nice spot to come for a date or for a drink with friends.",

The service is always good but the last time we came in Michael was our server and he was awesome! Friendly and funny. Making the service even more spectacular was his assistant Jason. He was on top of it the entire meal. I accidentally forgot my to go box and Jason ran it out to me. That is going above and beyond and I really appreciate that.

Loved everything about the place!  Name, ambience, service, food and the drinks!! It's legit mixology and not just shake shake serve. I loved my tall drinks. I sat at the bar and watched my bartender make our drinks and he made em with meticulous care which I appreciated. They all looked very good and tasted so good. It's a great feeling being excited about what you're ordering and this place definitely made me feel excited lol Classy feel inside sippin on my yummy yummy cocktails and eating delicious food after driving from Page, AZ.  Love the date-night feels of the place but it doesn't cater to JUST that. about to google if they have a branch in California.. probably not. :(  Only warning is pricing. It's not bad! But do know that good meal plates run from 15-20 bucks and drinks are $11. Experience was worth it!  Got the yakisoba and added lemongrass chicken which was bomb! Calamari fries were 90% real squid and only 10% breading which was nice Lol! Short ribs and lamb were enjoyed by my bf as well!",

    "text": "I love the look and feel of this place -it's very cozy and laid back, though a bit small.  They do have outside seating though.  This is just a side note though - who cares about the decor?  Let's talk about the food...  Came with a friend, so we shared :  Octopus Spring Roll - It was blah.  It's definitely over priced at $10 for 5 tiny pieces and lacked substance.  If you know what a spring roll looks like - well, they basically cut it up into 5 pieces.  The \"nuoc cham\"/ fish sauce for dipping had an okay flavor - but it lacked the necessary garlic, chili, and lime used in authentic fish sauce.  There was barely any octopus in the roll, accompanied with some lettuce. The octopus itself had a weird smokey flavor to it.  I probably won't order this one again.    Duck Steamed Bun - Overall flavor was good, but not amazing.  The sauce that is smeared inside the bun compliments the duck well, but it was very minimal - and as someone said in another review, a side of sauce should definitely accompany the bun.  The duck had very little texture, as it was too soft and fatty.  The duck skin should be crispy to compliment the softness of the bun.    Kimchi Fried Rice with BBQ pork - I have mixed feelings about this one, in a sense that it definitely doesn't taste like traditional kimchi fried rice I've had at Korean restaurants, but for something that doesn't taste like what it's supposed to taste like, it's not bad.  I love that the texture wasn't too greasy, and the seasoning was good.  They added enough kimchi, so it didn't overpower the dish.  My only gripe is that it doesn't come with an egg over easy.  That's like eating waffles without syrup.  I didn't hate this place, but I'm not sure if I like it either...  I'd probably come back to try their noodle entrees though.",

This place wants to be 5 stars...it's begging for it, but there are some things missing. #1 SAUCE. Something as simple as that would make this place 5 stars. Everything was delicious but needed that extra ounce of optional saturation to make it great. Duck buns, bok choy dumplings and the fried rice were all good. Also, the chairs in this plae are hard to move around, ESP at the bar, and make a ton of noise. Those little chair leg felt pieces would do this place wonders. Other than those small details, this place is awesome.  Overall, definitely give this place a try. The Clever Koi is so close to 5 stars, you may almost believe it is.",

(I believe she had the tofu kimchi fried rice, but I don't remember exactly.)  We had a couple other misses that night: dishes that had potential but whose specific execution made them a bit too strong in one direction and not well-rounded or enjoyable as full meals, and the place was slammed so service was a bit slow.  I had the Chicken Katsu, which was alright, but the nori was a bit off-putting next to fried chicken for me. Typically a meal I'm not crazy about would net a 3 star, but three out of four of us were unimpressed overall, and my friends are nowhere near as picky as I am. They just didn't love the specific executions they were served.",

My go-to had to be the kimchi fried rice. I have had it with pork belly and lemongrass chicken (my fave). The edamame fritters were another fave of mine. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to order a second plate but my pride wouldn't let me. :) Other great items; the spicy ribs, pig face dumplings, and pork ramen ($7 on happy hour!). Speaking of happy hour, they have a decent one with apps and several cocktails ($6). My fave HH cocktail was the Bees Knees. Love this place!",

The restaurant is very pretty and decorated well, and I like that the patio faces Central Avenue. You can valet in the back; the parking lot is right next to the one for George and Dragon.  My husband had the chicken katsu rice and I had the massaman udon. I didn't really care for the seasong on the katsu, and I thought the kimchi was just OK. The massaman udon was good, though I think there could have been more duck. Our food came out REALLY fast. I've read other reviews that suggest the food is premade and I did get that feeling - not that it was seasoned and frozen and then thawed out for me, but that it was made earlier in the day and kept warm until ready to be served. I might be completely off mark, but overall it was just good, not great.  I wouldn't mind going back for happy hour, especially if I can sit on the patio, and I'd like to try a few more menu items. Good, nice, A-OK.",

We also had a softshell crab bun, and while it was very tasty, it was completely outshone by the pork. The octopus was remarkable, perfectly cooked with a wonderful texture, and very tasty. The wings were the weakest dish, pretty boring, which is hard to understand given the excellence of the other dishes. We had the warm sticky date cake for dessert, and it was delicious. Cocktails were good, not mind-blowing, but certainly worth trying. Service was friendly and fun. Looking forward to my next visit. That was a great pork bun.",

I had the Temperance Trap, a tall gin drink with amaro, citrus, and bitters. Very refreshing and delicious. My boyfriend had a piney passion fruit drink we both also really enjoyed. We had the pig faced dumplings as an appetizer. They are served on a bed of kimchi and were the perfect beginning to our meal. We both built our own ramen bowls. I had pork belly with pork broth, bok choy and egg. It was so flavorful and the pork belly was the perfect mix of crisp on the outside and soft and tender on the inside.

When it comes to food, I haven't been able to find any other place in town that serves Ramen as tasty as Clever Koi. This is where I get my fix! I also love their smoked pig face dumplings (don't be scared of the name) and their duck steamed buns are awesome.

( I will bump them up a star or two if they take into consideration what I have to say, as a fellow industry person, and fix the problems)      Our most recent and probably final experience summed up:  -Owner/door man scolded us for setting our bikes against side of building. - Bartender was too busy making 4 minute long cocktails to serve us  - food is sooo salty, ramen dish was inedible first time. - Beef and vegetable gyoza were burnt and flavorless, and you get four for 8 bucks - malt vinegar/chili wings tasted like they were pre-cooked and had no flavor, and it also said on the menu that it came with a dozen, but there were only six - duck steamed bun was the worst thing I have ever eaten. - pretty much the staff is very stuck up/ unfriendly and the food is bland and does not deliver.

There are all ready so many great places in Central and Downtown Phoenix, but they're all either Mexican, burgers and salads or pizza. This is such a welcome and refreshing change to that line-up. From the moment I entered to the moment I left, service was spot-on. It was friendly, personable, the staff was knowledgable, I couldn't  have asked for or expected better. The same with the food. It was seriously one of the best meals I have ever had. I started with a single steamed bun with duck. It was so good. I contemplated ordering 2-3 more and just making that my meal. Since it was my first time there, I figured I'd try something else for my entree though. I had the chicken katzu rice bowl. WOW! Such a unique flavor.  I cannot wait to go back and drag everyone I know with me.",

It's as pretty as it is tasty. We ordered the pork belly steam buns which was by far my favorite thing on the menu and next time I come here I may just get 5 of these and nothing else. I also had the pig face dumplings which were good but pale in comparison to the steam buns. Last I ordered the Kimchi fried rice with duck. Surprisingly I got the choice of brown or white rice which I fully appreciate and have not received at most restaurants when it comes to fried rice. This was a great fried rice and good for sharing.

    "text": "Super excited to have this type of restaurant in Phoenix! the menu consists of dumplings, steam buns, noodle dishes, hot pots and several yummy appetizers. They also have a great drink menu with some awesome cocktails. We ended up getting there before 6 for an AWESOME happy hour! The HH menu has probably 5 or 6 food items and discounted drinks. We started with the salt and pepper shrimp, that were awesome! They even do it right and serve the crispy shrimp head! We also got the house wings that were in this sweet vinegar type sauce. Pretty good, I like my wings crispier but they were solid.. I had a lamb pastrami steam bun with mustard greens that was out of this world! Super flavorful, great texture. Just killer.  I also got my meal frm the HH  menu, a huge steaming awesome bowl of Ramen for $5!!! it had grilled bbq pork, sprouts, musrhooms, greens and a healthy potion of noodles topped off with an over easy egg. Great bowl of ramen. I wll say the noodles were a tad underdone and I found the broth a bit heavy, but still a mega legit bowl of ramen. My wife ordered the seafood hot pot. She wasn't a huge fan due to the spice factor, but it was a well put together dish. My fave part of her dish was this awesome fish cake! I had this deink called teh enabler, easily one of my fave drink in Phoenix right now. It had house smoked whiskey, maple honey and some bitters. Just a great smokey whiskey drink. Wifey had a glass of wine. the atmosphere is great, the food is great and they have a solid happy hour. to top it off, the service was perfect. I'll for sure be back to try the dumplings, more noodle dishes and several glasses of whiskey!",

Our next appetizer was Peking Duck Bun, I would say this was my favorite dish with everything we ordered. The bun was soft which it should be, the sauce that came with dipped with the bun and the meat brought out the flavor and was so tasteful. The next three dishes we ordered were Kimchi Fried Rice, some Ramen Soup, and Chicken Katsu (spelling??) they were all too blend. I usually eat pretty blend but these have no flavor. For Kimchi Fried Rice I didn't taste any Kimchi flavor. The soup for the Ramen was just soy sauce and water no soup base. Maybe I am an Asian and might have a little more high expectation on Asian food.",

Chicken & Waffles, Duck Confit, Soft Shell Crab, Roasted Pork Belly.   Next time we'll try the Ramen dishes. I'm not a big drinker but loved the Pimms.

To start, we sampled the pork belly and chicken/wafflle steamed buns. Along with our starters, we ordered some house cocktails (The Enabler and Dark&Stormy). Both drinks complimented our meals. The pork belly paired with the soft bun perfectly and the chicken & waffle was sweet/savory. For our entree, we tried the Duck Curry and the Thai Chili Beef. The Thai Chili Beef was very tender and cooked perfectly. My favorite part of our meal was definitely the Duck Curry. I am a sucker for duck and all things spicy so this was a no brainer. The curry, while being very spicy, had so much flavor in every bite it was hard to stop eating it and the duck was amazing. However, the star of the dish turned out to be the pickled peppers. I could not get over how good they were in the curry. All in all, amazing food and great staff. Very well done.",

The noodles soups are top notch, especially the Hot Pot seafood soup, as well as the simply delicious in a bowl, Roasted Pork noodle soup with ramen. I'm still thinking about it until now, although I could do without the mushrooms (and I like mushrooms). My friend and I, shared two starters, the Smoked \"Pig Face\" dumplings and the Peking Duck bun. The dumplings were scrumptious because of the pork, yum but i'm not sure if the price is justified at $8 for 4 pieces, it's pretty much the size of a gyoza dumpling, so, it's not large but taste factor it's on point. As for the Peking duck bun that can be split between two but one bun per person will suffice because it's plenty and delicious, I'm looking forward to trying out their other buns in the near future. My friend got the chicken katsu, and she said it was pretty good but advised that in the future, she'd get the sauce on the side because it was quite salty. Overall, love the resto layout, the overall feel is cozy but for some odd reason there seems to be a draft. Service was not slow but there seem to be confusion with some orders, I'm thinking it's first official day jitters, and eventually i'm sure, service will smoothen out. I'm looking forward to my next visit for a steaming bowl of noodles or maybe kimchi fried rice. YUM!",

    "text": "The food here was great. The reason I am giving them three stars is because my drink service was the worst I've experienced in years.  I arrived before my friend and was promptly seated. A server (and I'm saying \"a\" because it seemed that practically every employee served us at some point, likely contributing to the problem) came and took my drink order. My friend arrived about 5-10 minutes later, and he placed his drink order and received his first. I asked about my drink (to server #2) and she went to check on it, returning to say she could not find the ticket for it and asked what I had ordered. She returned a few minutes later with my drink and said it was on the house. Again, the food was great (we shared the chicken wings and each had the burger and fries, all on happy hour) and when I ordered a second of the same drink, they returned with a different drink. I'm not sure which server we were on by then, but I flagged one down, and told her it was the wrong drink. She asked if I did not like it, so I think she thought I had ordered it and did not care for it. I informed her I did not change my drink and had ordered the same drink as the first. She returned a few minutes later with the correct drink.   Then, a different server brought us two more of my drinks for the inconvenience. However, my friend had been drinking something completely different and did not like what I was drinking at all. So, it seemed to be a nice gesture, but poorly executed. With all the \"on the house\" drinks, the bill was still incorrect, but they rectified it.   I would return to this restaurant because the food is unique and flavorful. It's a small space, so maybe they do not assign servers to tables. But, with the mix-ups and not knowing who our server actually was, it got frustrating at times.",

Our server was sweet and she had great drink recommendations.   I ordered the cold green tea noodle bowl. I added egg, ginger, kimchi, sprouts, mushrooms & tofu. The house made Sriracha sauce was good, but I could have enjoyed more heat (but I'm a weirdo that likes to be in pain when I eat spicy food). My grandmother ordered the udon bowl with chicken broth and shrimp and veggies. They were super accommodating to my grandmother and over cooked her veggies she she could eat without making her uncomfortable. Her only complaint it wasn't salty enough. LOL. (I tasted her broth and thought it was fine)  We also ordered the seasonal corn dumpling, not sure of the exact name but they were awesome. Finally, I ordered a Poloma to drink. House made grapefruit juice & lemongrass soda with tequila and lime. I could seriously drink like 10.   Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely be back. YUM.",

Luckily, it was also happy hour so I got to go for their Pork Ramen priced at $8. I sat at the bar and it was pretty empty, even for happy hour.  The Pork Ramen came out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The broth is not Tonkotsu, but pretty simple. I enjoyed the ramen noodles as they were thick with a good chew. The pork belly was good, a bit tough but had this great roasted texture on the outside- almost crispy. Soft boiled egg was good! Perfect portion for ramen as well!   Service seemed lacking, but I was checked up on. Probably due to the place being a bit slow at the time, I mean I did seat myself since nobody was at the store front. Haha!  Decent food, would've wanted a more complex broth but interested to see what else they have to offer. Their drinks look pretty awesome too!",

The service was amazing, they had someone who personally came out just to make sure your water is full which is always a nice touch at any restaurant. The drinks were superb or so says my wife since I didn't have any mixed drinks just beer haha. The food was just as great as the service. I ordered Pork Ramen and my wife ordered the XO Noodles which where very tasty and the flavors easily complimented each other with nothing over powering them. Unfortunately we were both full from the food so we didn't do dessert this time around although there was a couple next to us who kept commenting to each other about one of the desserts and how amazing it tasted. I didn't get the name but I can tell this place enjoys great food and great service. I would definitely come back to Clever Koi again most likely the Gilbert location though but it just depends we go to Phoenix often as well for food and things.",

My favorite thing I ate was the pork belly buns! I could have made a meal just eating these!! Generous slices of pork served taco style on the buns with hoisin sauce, peanuts and cilantro!! Totally yummy goodness!! We also had the black bean pancakes, shumai dumplings, short rib dumplings and the shaking beef!! Each and every dish was spot on!! Plus, they had a great mixologist working the bar!! I would have to claim that it was the best meal we had out while visiting from Southern Oregon!! Highly recommend the Clever Koi!!",

I came here just for their steamed buns and ordered their chicken and waffle, pork belly, and soft shell crab.   Pork belly: the meat is lightly deep fried so the outer layer is slightly crispy but is super tender and juicy on the inside. It has so much flavor with the perfect amount of sweetness from the hoisin sauce and you get some freshness from the cilantro.   Soft shell: the soft shell is lightly deep fried, topped with carrots and cucumber! It was tangy from the lemon sauce but it went well with the soft shell crab.   Unfortunately, I was unable to eat the chicken and waffle because I got full after I ate the soft shell crab steamed buns.",

From the floor-to-ceiling windows to the warm lighting to the unique cocktails, it just oozes sultry class.  Now onto the food. I'll admit it, when I first ate at Clever Koi I tried to play it safe and was not overly impressed by the chow mein with tofu. It was a little oily and tasted mainly of lemongrass. The next time I went, I committed to the True fusion experience and had the edamame & kale dumplings with the corn ramen. It was unreal. The flavors were bold and innovative, but familiar in the best way.   If I can give any advice when you eat here, look for dishes that aren't necessarily in your comfort zone and just go for it!",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times now (two dinners and lunch), each time hoping to understand better all the rave reviews - I really want to love this restaurant, but unfortunately the some of the food, although ambitious, misses its mark.  The kitchen seemed to be having problems bringing out food during both dinner occasions I was there. I wouldn't have minded this, if the food was spot on. I recommend making a booking if you want to go for dinner.  The wait staff are attentive and polite, and each time I have visited, I have felt welcome.  ** FIRST VISIT: Dinner **  The first time I visited with 2 other people, we had to wait for our table for quite a while - the outdoor area was closed since it had been raining earlier that day. I ordered a \"riding the pine\" cocktail while we waited, which made the wait quite yummy. After pushing over an hour waiting and watching tables of people waiting for food that wasn't coming out, we asked one of the waitstaff if it would be ok to sit outside, and she said if we didn't mind that it was a little chilly outside, they could set a table for us. Yay! The seats were dry and it wasn't too cold outside.  I ordered the tempura catfish steamed bun for an appetizer, and the filling was delicious, fresh and vibrant. The tart and sweet apples and the sauce complemented the fried catfish well. The steamed bun however had a very dense, chewy and flat texture. A far cry from the fluffy steamed buns I have had at Ippudo.  I ordered a pork ramen for my main, and another cocktail. The pork belly topping was cooked really well - melt in your mouth and fall apart. Unfortunately the ramen egg was overcooked on all 3 ramens our table ordered - the yolk was set. The noodles were ok, but nothing very special. The most disappointing thing about the ramen was the soup - it was kind of grainy, insipid and lacking seasoning. I can see what the dish was aiming for, but it missed its mark.  My second cocktail never arrived, even though I asked waitstaff about it again after I had finished my main course.  To finish, our table shared some fritters for dessert, and they were quite nice. The miso caramel was a nice idea, but I couldn't taste the miso.  ** SECOND VISIT: Dinner **  The second time I visited with friends again - a table of 5. We booked in advance this time to avoid having to wait for a table. We were seated promptly and ordered a few appetizers to share.  The tart was delicious but small, I couldn't fault it with its flaky pastry and rich filling. I would go back just for this appetizer alone.  The pig face dumplings were also nice, however they were lacking filling. Filling and folding dumpling skins can be challenging though, and as someone with a PhD in Dumpling Cooking, I can understand that not everyone can make plump dumplings.  The steamed pork belly bun - filling was good, melt in your mouth, but the bun was still the same - chewy, flat and kind of hard.  For my main, I had a duck curry. It was nice and spicy, but the curry was lacking any flavor depth. I was looking forward to this, but I was really disappointed.  ** THIRD VISIT: Lunch **  I had a pork ramen again for lunch. I thought I would give it another go, since I thought that maybe the kitchen was under pressure during dinner service. Lunch time wasn't very busy, and our ramens came out quickly.  The pork belly seemed a bit dry this time. The egg was overcooked - yolk was set again, and the broth was once again non-impactful. Granted, I am a bit of a ramen freak, and I was really, really hoping Clever Koi would be come my go-to in Phoenix, but this is not the case.  Someone, for the love of noodles, please make good ramen in Phoenix so I don't have to travel for my fix!  If this is the \"Best of Phoenix\", then I feel like the culinary scene in Phoenix is in a really sad state.  Some of the menu items are fantastic (alright, so I've only found the tart), but most of the ones I have eaten so far have seemed to have a great vision, but missed out completely on execution.  I will be back to try again, because as I said, I really, really want to love this restaurant, and I am hoping that they will improve on what they have.",

It's an OK value so I might be willing to give it another chance. Service was quite attentive.  Started with the Sazerac cocktail ($10) which was pretty good. I expected it to be served on the rocks but it was just in an Old Fashioned glass by itself.  Pork Belly Bun ($4.50/single bun) - This was a mixed bag. The positive is that the pork belly was really delicious and had a nice crispy skin. The hoisin sauce pairs well and the cilantro works to add a nice kick of flavor. The bun is where it really let me down. It was a bit hard and felt like they had it sitting around for a day or two.  Rabbit Dumpling ($10/4 dumplings) - Overall the flavors were good. The inside of the dumplings was stuffed with ground rabbit, which tasted fine, slightly gamey, not overly dry. The pickled thin slices of carrot were really good and helps brighten the dish. The dumplings were shaped kind of weird, it was rectangular so definitely not what I'm used to. If they were going for gyoza they needed to pan fry it for a bit longer to get the outside slightly crispy.  Pineapple Duck ($16) - This was a duck leg (more like a leg quarter) that was really crispy on the outside sitting on a white rice deep fried \"croquette\". The duck leg was a bit overcooked in some areas which can be expected based on how much variation in thickness there is with the cut. The rice was quite interesting and not something I've really had before, it was crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The Chinese eggplant was really good and not too soft or hard, and seasoned with some Sriracha.",

Be sure to try it out if your hanging out in Downtown Phoenix, and from what I heard...there will be a new location in Gilbert very soon!

Nice and quiet restaurant with a menu full of house-created drinks. $11 seems a bit steep for cocktails but they were plenty strong so I can't complain. Hubs had the duck curry and it was good, but definitely on the spicy side. He liked it but it was too much heat for me. I had the salmon noodle salad, which was awesome. Something I wouldn't normally have ordered but I really enjoyed it. It was a great mix of flavors and textures.",

My girlfriend and I went for dinner for our first time and started out with the wings and the yellowtail crudo.  The wings were a perfect spicy with crushed peanuts to add some awesome flavor.  The yellowtail crudo was delicious as well, very good citrus flavor to get the meal started.  For an entree, she chose the spicy seafood hot pot, which was awesome.  I chose two steamed buns, the pork belly and the chicken and waffle bun.  Both were ridiculous for their own reasons.  The pork belly had so much flavor and the kimchee waffle was a perfect twist on a soul food classic.    The staff was very friendly and the chef, Jared, was a cool dude and very knowledgable.  You can always tell by looking at a menu whether the chef has a passion for food and this menu is a prime example.  We will definitely be back soon.

    "text": "We ate outside. They have high fans outside that are quiet but keeps nice breezes coming along. It was very nice. Inside looked great, too. Very streamlined with tasteful decorations.   It was hard to pick what to eat. A lot of yelpers posted great pictures but they change the menu every few months so a lot of the pictures weren't being served. However they have a small menu so it's focused and makes your choice easier.   We had the duck curry. It was pretty spicy but it's a nice thickened curry with big udon noodles. As I figured with most dishes here, it didn't have a lot of meat. You can probably see that in various dishes in the photos posted. The roasted potatoes in there were great.   We had the tea-a-misu which I didn't care for. The texture was off. I wanted to try the steamed bun sandwiches but I couldn't justify the price for just one.   They have an eclectic drink menu that is certainly fun to try. Happy Hour covers some drinks and some appetizers and it's 3-6pm everyday.   What upped this rating was the service. We were treated by probably three different people but they were all friendly and not just with the standard recited lines too. We had questions and they were all informative and all of them checked up on us at some point to make sure we were doing okay.",

    "text": "Mon was my 2nd time here. Our experience the 1st time, more than a year ago, was a mixed bag: the food was great, but the servers seemed disorganized. They got our drink orders wrong 3 times.   This time the service was better, but it still seems the wait staff somewhat stumbles over each other, figuratively speaking. It's like servers are not dedicated to a set of tables, but rather take turns, which doesn't lend itself well to service continuity. At one point we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come over and ask if we wanted addItional drinks. The staff was friendly and helpful, however, so 3.5 stars for service.   I thought the cocktails were on the weak side (I had 3 different ones and they all suffered from this issue), so 3 stars there. The food, on the other hand, was even better than I had remembered it. I had the soft shell crab po' boy, and the pork belly and tempura catfish bao buns, all of which were delicious. The fries were some of the best I've had in PHX. 5 stars for the food.  Ambiance was a 5: great location, cool space and decor, very busy (for a Mon) as the night progressed (we were there from 5 until 8:30), acceptable music levels, and eclectic patrons.  Overall, a solid 4-star dining experience. Food-option-wise they're in my Top 5 in the Valley (I've eaten at at least 100 restaurants here). If they can get the service kinks worked out, and kick up the alcohol content in their cocktails, they could easily be a 5-star place. Regardless, I will return...and it won't be a year again this time.",

Like most other Asian or ethnic food in AZ, it was run by the local hipsters.  I again was the only Asian in the place.  Not a knock, just always feels weird for me.  Alone, I chose the counter, and ordered the local IPA and was served my ramen with pork belly soon after.  It was hearty and good, albeit small.  The girl at the counter was very nice, as well as the bearded beer guy.  I would return again for lunch.",

    "text": "This Asian fusion restaurant has created quite a buzz with their steamed buns and happy hour menu. The frontal open patio can be a great place for hanging out and people watching during the not-so-hot seasons. By extension, the modern, immaculate interior encompasses large see-through glass windows, full bar, rows of tables, and touches of Asian artifacts. The atmosphere is completely hipsterish. Fellow Yelper Tony Y. Jr was in town for a visit, so we stopped by for happy hour and a light meal.  The Roasted Pork Belly Steamed Bun ($4.50) was served with hoisin, cilantro, and peanuts. The soft and fluffy steamed buns were addictive, but they were also pre-packaged and not made from scratch. The pork belly was tasty, but could be steeped in seasoning and roasted for a longer period of time. The touches of sauce and garnishes added some depth. It was a decent option, but the taste of the pork belly has to be more striking than it appeared.   The Peking Duck Steamed Bun ($4.50) was put together with bacon, mizuna, and charred plum jam. The dry spots on the duck tasted oven baked with confit-like textures. The depth of seasoning was lacking the deep star anise flavors. The sauce and garnishes gave a nice savory and sweet contrast. Again, the duck should be a lot more robust and flavorful to add twists to the soft fluffy buns.  The Pork Ramen ($7) comes with braised pork belly, ribs, scallion, mustard green, kimchi, hearts of palm, and poached egg. They recently raised the happy hour prices but should really kept it at $5. The pork belly had a good fatty to meat ratio, but the broth was steeped with mustard green flavor that prevented the pork fat and shoyu to anchor the chewy egg noodles. The runny poached egg was a Western cop out on what is supposed to be soft-boiled egg. For what it is worth, I would only pay $5 for it.   I've been here on many other occasions and service was attentive on most of my visits. I didn't get to review their other menu items, but there was overall a breadth of originality that did not translate into the kinds of sharp flavors, depth, refinement, and wow factors expected in the execution. 2.5 stars, I will only return when I'm invited to come hang out with friends.",

    "text": "Went with friends.   I had the chicken wings app and pork tenderloin entree.  The wings were very messy with the sauce, as was expected, and they were nothing to write home about. Flavor was slightly Asian, but not much.    Friends got the tuna chips app and that was delicious. Chips were tortilla shaped, but very thin, crisp, and light. The tuna and ingredients made some of the chips soggy.  The tuna on it was partially raw/seared and was great. Avocado was on top.  I thought it was wasabi, but it was not.  My pork came on top of some mix that was delicious.  I ate some of that first. Then I are the pork by starting on the outside, but then decided to cut through the middle to eat the meat where there was less fat/gristle. When I did that, I took a thin slice from the middle and it tasted under-cooked, even raw.  The texture was not of cooked pork.  Then I looked closely at it and it was pink and not white like cooked pork should be.  Since I have great concerns eating any raw pork due to the parasitic worms traditionally in pork meat that must be thoroughly cooked to kill them, I noted it to the water refill guy.  He said he would check on it. He then quickly came back and said that they would cook me a new one.  I was glad to hear that without having to ask. I thought they may just microwave or reheat it on the hot plate.    When the new pork tenderloin came, it was perfectly cooked, delicious, and white on the inside as expected. Not at all raw thankfully.  I appreciated their great customer service, and they made it right with me by replacing the order with a fresh one.  Although this one was still a bit fatty/gristly, since it was well cooked, the fat was rendered well and had a nice crisp singe on it that made it taste really good.  I used their table green and red sauce with it which made for a delicious sauce.   My friends had pad Thai. She was unimpressed with it and did not like the nuts that came with it (which was noted on the menu).  I let her know that she should specify no nuts in the future since pad Thai always comes with nuts.  She got it with shrimp. The shrimp were small-medium sized. She did not finish her meal. The noodles (to me) were a bit under-cooked and chewy.  She said she does not want to return there.  I would not mind going there again and trying other things.  Other friend had shrimp over brown rice (which looked like black rice when it arrived).  The shrimp were giant on that entree and he enjoyed his meal quite a bit.  He ate all of it.  I give it 4/5 stars because pork should never be served raw/under-cooked.  It's a health hazard.  Otherwise it would have been 5/5 because the service was exceptional and they made it right.",

The few times I was here I didn't recall having issue with my servers. We went with big groups so taking a bit longer than normal for dinner to me is understandable.   I do however have mixed reviews with the food. The last time i was here the food was extremely salty. I love salt and like to add salt on my meal but it was beyond reasonable. On the other hand...the last time I had the buns they were yummy!  I also like that this place have mixed crowd which is another thing i look for when I go out.",

Their pig face dumplings were delicious and flavorful with that added bite from the kimchi, as were their Asian version of corn dog bites that contained chinese sausage. Their ramen was also a modern version, as it was creamier and contained less broth than the traditional stuff, but it did not disappoint as it was full of fresh vegetables and very filling. I really enjoyed the Massaman curry with duck and a delicious Thai flavored coconut curry sauce. If you're looking for a healthier option, the Mixed Grill is a fantastic choice which contains your choice of meat. I chose the flat iron bulgogi which was an awesome choice, the meat had a nice marinade and was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The veggies that came with it were also fresh and crunchy, and the dipping sauces were a very good addition.  Clever Koi also has a fantastic happy hour which is from 4-7. They make a great Pimms Cup and Dark & Stormy. If you're looking for a less sweet drink then the Paloma is also a great choice. I love how their happy hour includes lots food options too. I would highly recommend Clever Koi, I will return many more times to enjoy their happy hour and delicious Asian Fusion.",

Another random girl brought them to us, spilling the overfilled cocktails on the way. Drinks were good. Food showed up shortly after. Ramen was good, friends wings still had peanuts on them. Nothing special, maybe come here for hh but I don't think I'd come here any other time.",

We met Nick who is one of the owners as he walked around and made everyone feel so welcomed. He introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. After that we felt we had made a new friend. While sitting at their Wok Bar the second owner who appeared to be the top chef was so informative with the dishes. Jarred was phenomenal and extremely thorough. He even made us a dish and said it was on the house. Over all our experience here was the best I have ever had in an establishment like this. I will definitely come back.!!!!",

His response was to go to The Clever Koi, and try to make it before happy hour was over at 6pm. By the time I walked in it was 6:01pm. I was instantly amazed by the atmosphere. it was very warm and welcoming. I was greeted by the hostess and immediately sat at the bar so I could still put in my order for happy hour special. The bar tender was one of the owners, and took my drink order. Which was made by a very good female bartender. It was refreshing and just what i needed. I also got dumplings, and the Koi Burger. I don't know how they made them, nor what they put in them, but this dumplings were just incredible! So delicious that I was so close to getting another order. In the end it was a good thing i didn't. Once I got the burger, I was wowed and in heaven. It was big, it was juicy, and boy was it tasty! damn best burger I have ever had! Even just writing about it now is making me crave another one. How I wish the owners would open up a business in Las Vegas. This is definitely the place to go and try out. I can not see anything on their menu tasting bad. All in all it truly was an incredible experience. Worth every bite and every penny. The owners are down to earth, fun and very welcoming. Thank you for a great night.",

We started  with the pork dumping.  The meat was not seasoned well  and was mushy . The pork bun had a lot of flavor but the pork belly was too  fatty.  We tried  the Ramen noodles with the pork broth . It was a little  bitter and too salty. We tried  the duck fried rice which was OK . The best dish was the shrimp  chow mein. The food was below average . I think I am too used to eating Chinese.  Service was good . Don't think the I will be back . The price was a little  high for lunch",

    "text": "Came here to celebrate my mom took me because I was in the mood for sushi and she said she saw this cool Japanese restaurant driving home one day. We went, the waiter sat us and brought us some kind of grapefruit soda. The lunch menu was I guess different then the dinner menu there was no sushi at all. I was sad but still willing to try the one thing they did have on the lunch menu which was a build your own bowl and a appetizer. The appetizer took almost a good 20 min it was about the size of my palm maybe smaller it was terrible it was a waffle with a small piece of chicken and some kind of sweet and sour chili sauce the chicken was so incredible dry it wasn't edible and the waffle was so soggy! I love chicken and waffles but god damn what the hell were they trying to pull off. The waiter never came back after that, no one did...there was literally one other person in there eating and 4 waiters all tucked in a corner talking about I'm sure how hip they look cause that's all they were good for was being pretty the waiting was garbage. Finally 45 mins later our food came out and I'm not going to bore you with my description of how terrible this food was all I'll say is I swear someone used dirt as seasoning there wasn't a lick of flavor in me or my moms dishes. Wtf man my mom was trying to hunt down one of the 4 waiters 3 times the last time she had to stand up and wave her arms around. And finally one of the cooks came over all she wanted was some sauce to make what we ate a little more edible. Anyway 50 dollars was the total and it was 50 dollars down the toilet and a horrible celebratory lunch. I'm never coming back my moms never coming back and I'm not suggesting this place to anyone. Mad terrible",

    "text": "Finally experienced The Clever Koi! Parking was simple, I just let the valet take care of it (free valet, just tip the poor guy). The atmosphere was super hipster, what do you expect it's downtown Phoenix. I was loving every second of the music - all my current faves like Flume and Chet Faker. My drink was so tasty! I even had to tweet them about it when I left! Yes, I HAD to. They have a drink option called \"Hey Bartender!\" where you pick your liquor or any flavors you want and the bartender makes something up for you. This works perfectly for dorks like me who can never just pick something and don't necessarily have a go-to. I asked for gin and the waiter looked challengingly at me like \"...you sure that's it?\" so I said something with citrus flavors. YUM! I forgot to ask what it was exactly but it tasted light, sparkling, citrusy, hands down the perfect summer cocktail.   To start my Dad and I each had one of the steamed buns. I had duck, he had pork. Both were delicious and flavorful. My pork ramen surprised me because I didn't realize the pork would have the bones in it, maybe I was supposed to know that but I didn't and it freaked me out just a bit (that's my own thing). Other than that I enjoyed my dish, though it was a bit salty I think that's probably to be expected with a broth. It wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but I would eat it again. I might try the veggie one next time. I think I would like to come back for happy hour and just order a bunch of the steamed buns and some of the appetizers.   The service was friendly and attentive. Who I assumed was the manager came by to check on us, as well as our server. The server was quick to make recommendations and tell us about his favorite items. He seemed knowledgeable about the menu, which I always think is important. The patio looked like it had some high tech spinning mister system, so it might not be too bad to sit out there in these summer months. Also, I thought the price points were very reasonable.",

Entrees are ramen, rice, and meat entrees which are filling and above average in quality and taste. Overall, worth coming back to and centrally located near Phoenix's downtown nightlife.",

Bravo sir!  The steamed buns are definitely worth trying, in fact, try them all. The Poutine was superb. The chef used to work at The Parlor when it was at its best so you know this guy knows how to cook. Another great addition to Phoenix dining.",

Personal \"favs\" - Hands down - the pig face dumpling is the \"perfect bite.\"  My wife and I are committed to good food.  That is to say, we fly places to eat - sometimes across oceans and borders.  It is heartening to know that Clever Koi is just up the block, a bike ride away.  We like to sit at the Chef's bar and watch all of the food coming out of the kitchen.  The seafood hotpot is delicious.  The fired vegetable platter is a great starter, or night ender.  The sliders never disappoint.  And everyone, from the owners, cooks, servers, mixologists are pleasant.  If I had a restaurant that I had to take to that deserted island for an unknown duration of stay... Clever Koi would be my top pick.  The food comforts and delights all at the same time.",

It was pretty bland, which was a major let down.  The female bartender wasn't very pleasant and had a constant angry look on her face.

The drink list is pretty amazing, with unique cocktails and new takes on classic libations. The pork belly ramen was off the chain, so if it's on the menu, don't hesitate to get it! Their specials are pretty amazing as well. Upscale casual dress and diverse crowd. (FYI, I love that this place embraces diversity.)  I wouldn't go here for groups more than six. Tables are pretty tight as it is and you'd be waiting......for....ever.....to get a table. They're open for lunch, so if you're nearby, give it a shot!",

We had a seat at the bar and were promptly served waters. Ok good start. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I'm not joking we both finished our waters before we had to flag down one of the bartenders who had been walking in front of us several times ignoring us. We had to ask for a menu and to get any kind of service. I ordered my drink and my date ordered a beer. The drink took forever and the bartender completely forgot the beer altogether and had to be reminded. Annoying. When they finally asked what we wanted to order he literally WALKED AWAY from us when we were in the middle of ordering and didn't come back for a few minutes. We eventually ordered an appetizer and entrees. Our entrees came out first, then the appetizers about 10 minutes later. Ugh. We were never checked on, and generally were made to feel like an inconvenience. I truly do not know how you get such bad service at the bar when the bartenders are literally confined to the space in front of you, but somehow it happened. The only reason for the two stars is because the food was perfect as always. Otherwise I was horribly embarrassed to have chosen Clever Koi as a date night spot. I probably won't be back anytime soon.",

We sat outside and ordered a round of drinks, I was in the mood for a pina colada but unfortunately they were out of an ingredient for it so the bartender said he could make me something else. The drink he brought had bourbon in it and I was not a fan, however I was going to try and drink it anyway. At the end of our dinner the server (I wish I could remember her name) noticed I didn't like the drink so she took it away and asked if she could try again and bring me something else I said sure! She came back with a drink I originally was thinking about getting and I was very happy with it. I really wish I could remember her name because she was very sweet and even offered to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. We'll definitely be back because everything was splendid!",

I'm not sure which one it was, but since I'm the only one who got sick and only I ate the BBQ Ribs, while the rest of the table split the other two, I'm assuming it was that.

Walking up to the restaurant, past the artful logo painted on the facade, you'll find large glass windows through which you see trendy Asian inspired interiors abustle with activity. Whether you are in a group or on a date, find yourself a seat and ready yourself for delicious food and drink. The menu has an array of choices from small bites like steamed buns or Brussels sprouts to bowls of piping hot ramen. I settled on the cauliflower ramen with picked persimmon, cashews, and a soft boiled egg, which came on the side in a small bamboo dish. Oh lawd- the silky coconut milk broth, tang of pickled persimmon, tender crunch of cauliflower, and rich egg yolk came together in harmony in each bite. Let's just say there were zero leftovers.   The experience was made complete by the excellent bar program with drinks like the Enabler- a delightfully rustic sipper with hickory smoked whiskey, grilled lemon, bitters and maple syrup. The sweetness from the maple played off the smoky whiskey in perfect balance. There are wines and beer too for the those not fancying the hard stuff.  By all means, when in Phoenix, step into the Clever Koi for an enjoyable and satisfying  evening",

My first impressions were fantastic, that is, if I wanted to have an extra pretentious dinner...The service staff were about as friendly as a Waffle House in New Jersey, and if you're not from the shores, allowed me to explain....they're not. Food is definitely subpar. If there was a bar or some sort of standard of quality and taste, they definitely lowered it underground to allow such restaurant to remain in existence.   Yelp should allow the ratings of negative stars in cases of such extreme substandards. This is one of those cases. Clever Koi...clever not to come out to this place maybe.   Good atmosphere. Crappy service, except for the manager, maybe too much attention was paid to our party...oh well...that ship has sailed. Food could not be any worse. Enough said...

We had previously perused the dinner menu so we were excited to try some of the new dishes.   We started with the crudite which was a nice assortment of veggies; radish, beets, snow peas, asparagus, etc. It came with a sesame tzatziki sauce which was yummy! We also tried the duck croquettes with roasted beets. My Dad's words: \"where has this been all my life?!\" Super tasty. Appetizers arrived quickly.  There was a slight delay for our entrees but this was around 8:00 on a Friday for our six top. We had a few gluten free dishes which the manager accommodated and delivered personally.  The Mushroom Ramen was amazing as was the Pork Belly. I always appreciate the homemade Sriracha to spice up my bowl.  Overall this was a great choice for my family dinner. As I said it was a busy Friday night so it was a tad loud inside. Their patio is amazing though if you're looking for a more relaxing ambiance. They had heavy duty misters running to keep it cool outdoors.  Definitely need to visit for dinner more often. The variety of dishes left us all debating our choices for a good 15 minutes. I would absolutely order the mushroom Ramen again, it was delicious!",

They were happy to oblige and wow, am I glad they did.  If you are fortunate enough to be in the area between 3-6 p.m. you will be thrilled with this menu item.

    "text": "Five stars. Yes five. The food is fantastic, thoughtful, creative...   We started things out with the Wood Fired Grill Plate, which was a yummy selection of roasted toasted char-tastic veggies along with a respectable portion of spiced shrimp and chicken. It's not often you order an \"appetizer\" in a restaurant these days for $15 or less, and think to yourself it would make a great entree... very good with the plumb sauce and a pristine vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  Next came the perfectly spiced ramen in a few different flavors: The Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, the Lemon Pepper Chicken, and the Cauliflower ramen in a coconut base. All were exceptionally tasty with deep rich flavors that go well beyond simple spice. We love vietnamese \"pho\" and classic ramen bowls, and these will not disappoint. The broth in all three was so complex and enlightening, it was almost like eating something with a soul... (but not in a creepy Rush Limbaugh kind of way!)  And the fact these guys do it right AND do it gluten free means I don't have to ride the moist-wipe train the \"morning after\", or be embarrassed by the inevitable facial hives that pop up when exposed to gluten... (Think Woogie from Something About Mary). These are things us Celiacs really appreciate!   Butt I digress...  Mixology is not something to be trifled with if you are an amateur or don't know the difference between a vodka martini straight up & one with a twist. Rest assured these guys (and gals) are pros.   I began with an orange bitters gin martini, graduated to an old fashioned with Filipino cane sugar and (cinnamon?) and finished with a drink that sounded like it was named after some guys jizz. It was noisy, so I'm not exactly sure... but (not) surprisingly the drink was excellent. It was so good in fact, I \"finished\" with three more and it inspired me to compose a new song about the occasion...which I \"rapped\" to David who was blown away by my incredible talent. Talk about a happy ending...  There's one thing I'd like to point out about the drinks: They are hand crafted and it shows! Ok, there's a second thing too: they are reasonably priced and ... Crap there's a third thing: they're also strong enough to achieve their purpose, which in this case was a good ole' fashioned buzz.  Now, on to the crew. Nick, Mike, David, girl who \"had to meet me\", girl who took our picture, and 2nd owner bartender extraordinaire (didn't get his name, but we share a common love of the Michael Jordan hair-do and strong drinks):  All the folks who work here are fun. And by fun I mean people who know how to have a good time, and at the same time provide some of the best service of any hip place in the valley we've been to...(and if you saw my Buddha you'd believe we've been to most of them).  Amazingly, they remembered us from our first visit over a month ago, and each of the crew came over to say hello and chat. Apparently We made quite an impression...?Meanwhile our drinks were never empty, the food seemed to come out in two shakes of a lambs tail (bravo to Chef and the kitchen staff!) and we didn't even have to pay tax on the alcohol. Is that a new thing?  David is a walking piece of art, with all kinds of bitchin tattoos (yea, bitchin is so 80's, I know). And he has the hair of Jesus (as it was depicted in all the oil paintings of Jesus I gazed upon in our Mormon church when I was a kid). Mike, what can we say about Mike? He's quirky and sarcastic, yet has a sweet edge to him that makes you want to hang out or go snow-boarding. And Nick... The 163 pound man with the cutest baby-girl on earth who tickled my 300 pound Buddha and got away with it. Imagine my surprise when I found out he's one of the owners. LOL.  Seriously this is an all around great place to eat filled with interesting characters who are passionate about life and good food, and we'll be going back again and again. We had an absolute blast!  Eat here, or you suck.",

They don't take reservations for small parties so we had to show up and put our name in.  We were able to go next door to the wine bar to wait for a table so we were able to grab a drink.  They came and got us when it was ready.  We tried a few things on the menu to get a sense of the food.  I have to admit, it fell flat.  The Peking duck croquettes were decent and the pork belly bun was tasty.  The pig face dumpling wasn't that great, nor was the chicken/waffle bun.  The szechuan peppercorn beef was kind of bland.  The drinks we had weren't bad.  The server was friendly but disappeared after the food was delivered.  Overall, it was ok.  If friends were meeting for happy hour I would probably come back but other than that I don't see myself making a specific trip.",

    "text": "I like the energetic atmosphere. The drinks are good and reasonably priced. Some things I tried were down right CLEVER and other things I tried I was left underwhelmed with.   The Caesar Salad is a delicate symphony of classic infused with the most delicate of Asian Flavors and even though I only had a small bite of it I thought it was delightful. I was expecting the Szechuan Crouton to be something special either spicy or full of flavor but it was just a hard lump of something I couldn't determine.  The Roast Corn Dumplings were another one of the very goods. The dumplings were tender and dressed with finely cut scallions. The Tomato Broth was multi-dimential with changing flavors of sofrito, ginger and Thai Basil with a building but not too hot heat.  I thought both appetizers were very good and will forget about the Szechuan Croutons.  I had the Salmon Bibimpap. I do note I am more sensitive than most people about smoke flavor and some smoke flavors are hard for me to tolerate. My first bite of the salmon was delicious with a charcoal kind of flavor that I enjoy but most of the salmon had a strong smoke flavor that took over. My vegetables were fresh and they gave me lots of brown rice. I didn't really taste any Korean Chili Glaze in my dish so I don't know if it had any or not. People who don't mind a smokey taste will like this dish.  My husband had the Kung Pao Fried Chicken. He was a little disappointed because the chicken was very soft and in his words \"squishy\" He was also disappointed because the spice and flavor level was \"Old White People from Sun City\".  I thought the Tea-a-misu was exactly the way it was described on the menu.  The Roasted Peach Fritters were really Donuts with a little bit of Peach in them. They were made fresh to order and were tasty with the Cream Cheese Dip.  Service was friendly but a little odd.   My husband expressed his opinions to the management about the food. Our bill arrives and one dinner was removed. My husband pulled out his card to pay and tells the waitress it wasn't necessary to remove his dinner.   So she comes back and ADDS the dinner back on.  That was odd wasn't it?  Good Drinks and Good Appetizers in an energetic atmosphere. I note you have to valet park behind the building to dine here.",

And then, by happy accident we received the wrong appetizer and to our surprise a tempuraed tentacle was placed on our table.  We decided to try it anyway, and who knew octopus would be so amazing.  The sauce and the tomato and plum jam was out of this world.  The octopus was so delicious.  We were thrilled with the mistake.  We shared the beef as our main dish.  The charred vegetables were so good.   This was our least favorite dish but we would still give it a very high rating.  But the steamed buns are calling our names, enticing us back for more.  And soon enough we will be happily reunited.",

The 3 owners we are all awesome and super friendly. I sat at the bar by the grill and just talked with the the head chef while I ate his delicious food.  Now to the food. Ok so menu was super condensed  and easy to navigate for anytype of bowl you want. I ordered a udon with pork broth, pork belly, and steak. It also had various vegetables and egg.  The pork belly was crispy and phenomenal steak was cooked perfectly  and broth was on point. Im a soy sauce guy but I needed none for this meal.  When I was talking to the chef I mentioned how amazing the pork face sriracha  looked and hes like wanna try them. Ummmm yeah dude!!!  Pork Face Dumplings with home made sriracha=Amazeballs. No more description needed just order them and be blown away.  10 vibe 10 food 10.5 service.  Overall I would definitely come back and recommend all my friends. I am also stoked they are opening a second location in gilbery at the end of September   Good job guys great restaurant.",

There was so much butter, it felt and tasted like the two pieces of bread were fried. I took a bite into the chicken alone, and had a hard time swallowing it down due to the excessive richness and butter. I threw the entree away after my third bite (I ordered through UberEATS) because all I tasted was cilantro. Cilantro tastes like soap to me, and I would have asked for them to leave it off if it were listed in the ingredients. Worst sandwich I've ever had. At that point I was thankful that I had ordered the pork face dumplings as well. However, they were served with sriracha rather than a broth/dumpling dipping sauce. All I could taste was sriracha. Overall the experience was very disappointing.",

My girlfriend and I ordered the following for dinner:  To start: Black bean and celery root pancakes Corn dumplings  Mains: Kimchi fried rice w chicken Vegetarian chow mein  I'll give Clever Koi props on their starters which were both fantastic.  Their house made sauces add an extra dimension to these dishes.  I love spicy so dipped my bites in their green sriracha.  Where the meal went sideways is with the kimchi fried rice.  Specifically, the kimchi.    It tasted exceedingly of vinegar and undermined the whole dish.  Alone, the fried rice and chicken are pretty good.  Having lived in South Korea, I know what authentic (and quality) kimchi tastes like.  The kimchi at the Clever Koi does not taste like it has been properly fermented.  Rather, I imagine the ingredients were thrown together without respect for the process and True nature of the dish.  This is my best guess as to the source of such an overwhelming taste of vinegar that clashed with the other flavors.  Please note that I absolutely love kimchi and am not opposed to their concept.  My girlfriends vegetarian chow mein was fresh and executed well.  I am deducting two stars because whether the Clever Koi intentionally prepares their kimchi this way or if it was an off night - it tanked the meal for me.  I am open to giving the Clever Koi another chance, but would need to be thoroughly impressed to become a repeat customer.",

I ordered the crab buns (not sure the official name) first off it took over 40 minutes for our food to come out (it wasn't busy) and when it did come out the duck was dry and the steak was cold. My friend told the runner that the steak was cold and she swiftly took it away and apologized. When said steak was brought back you could tell they popped it in the microwave and sprinkled some salt on top. No bueno. It went from medium to well done. Gross. As for my crab thingies, I just didn't care for the taste but other peeps might. First and last visit to CK. Oh, one thing I give them credit for was taking the dry duck off the bill.

That was amazing!  Such a wonderful broth, and the seasonings were delicious.    He also had an old fashioned which was made well.    For dinner I had the seasonal vegetable plate.  The yams were perfect.  He had the pork ramen with gluten free noodles.  This is wonderful for him with his gluten allergy.  For dessert I had the chocolate pudding.  I really did not care for it at all, too sweet and not much flavor.  Overall, a wonderful place.  We will go back!",

    "text": "A dinner at clever koi is an unforgettable experience, not to be missed. It's a nice looking restaurant, the food is fantastic, and you'll be thinking about it long after the meal is over. We started with the dumpling which was unique and curiously flavored.   My main course, The seafood hot pot, was tender, moist pieces of calamary steak, smothered in a delicious broth with tomato, honey, cardamom and what I'm assuming was a pound of laxatives. I haven't stopped shitting since 9:30PM of last night.  Nasty white chick in dreads working at the kitchen seemed to shed her locks as she proceeds to cook poorly seasoned dishes that tore through my anal cavity with the awesome fury of the Horsemen of the apocalypse. Well done I say. By the way I never received one single smile from the serving staff. But, who needs smiles if they're serving foods of this caliber.   Someone saw that we did not touch our food, after some initial examination. The manager sent us his compliments, dessert of deep-fried bread balls, to be dipped in delectable exotic caramel sauce, which incinerated everything in my intestines. My morning was an unforgettable thrill ride. Mostly from the comfort of my bathroom. Semi-private. I have roommates.   The exotic flavors and aromas of Asia came flooding back to me as I literally peed out of my butt.  If you are portly or tall, or simply a gentleman of indiscriminate palate, or simply someone who suffer from chronic incontinent, this is the place. Simply start your meal with anything on the menu...you're either taste your food yet again upon its exit from your mouth hole, or your anus shall afford the pleasure once the curious spices of Clever Koi lands in the lower intestines.",

(He orders based on the name.. although he won't admit to this. I think it was called bad news something..) It took 5-10 minutes to make, that kind of fancy. It was strong and he enjoyed the detail and it took all night to drink, haha. We went for some hot asian buns *Yum, miss the ones in Chi-town!!) and they were good. I was drawn to the chicken and waffles but glad I didn't order a 100 for me, because they are SPICY! We ended up ordering random litle pairings of food for the table. Waitress was on point, food delivery was quick.  Would eat again: Pork belly, soft shell crab (Ok, I'm going to be honest. I couldnt LOOK at those little legs but I devoured mine and it came in a delicious sauce) We also ordered the chow mein and substituted the mushrooms for leeks. Wonderful.  Great atmosphere, enjoyed the owners. Attention to detail and service while being human-like :) and non-stuffy is appreciated.  Cute bathrooms (I dont know why that is important, but it is. Every restaurant on Central has cute bathrooms..) We were some of the last to leave and never felt rushed. Cute spot.",

We came to try the drinks that we hear such rave reviews about so we weren't initially planning to order any food. The bar was full so we were seated at a table and asked our waitress for an appetizer suggestion. She lead us to choose the Chinese long beans, which I never would have picked on my own, and they were fabulous! Did I mention they come with duck tongue? It sounded weird to me at first but it was seriously delicious. We also decided to try the steamed buns; the lamb pastrami and onion ring were so flavorful. Oh, and the onion ring bun came with a sriracha sauce that made my night because I love spicy anything. The drinks we ordered were the best drinks I think I've ever had. I tried the enabler and my friend ordered the reviver. Needless to say both of our drinks were so good we each had to have two. We could see the bartender actually making the drinks and taking his time crafting them, which I thought was a unique added touch.   My only complaint is that I live in Tucson and wish it was closer so I could branch out more often. Here's hoping they open a location in Tucson!",

    "text": "3 drinks + eight dishes + 2 desserts gave four of us a good feel for the Clever Koi style. This multi-Asian concept food needs more definition.  The drinks were topped only by the beet salad which was the best of the bunch. The ramen is a good value on the HH menu. Most all meats seemed a bit mushy and ALL of the dishes (except the hot pot and octopus) had a cloying undertone of sweet.  Kung Pao Brisket with no pow, hot pot seafood where the hot was all of the chili variety. Octopus that was tender but served over \"crispy\" rice that just seems like the bottom of the rice pot floating in sauce. Duck bun with interesting, yummy meats but not \"Peking\" and couldn't taste \"charred plum jam.\"  The restaurant is in a nice reused building.  Parking is behind the building, enter on 1st Ave. for comp valet.  Consider sitting outside if the weather warrants it so that your clothes and hair won't reek of cooking smells.  (Wow, maybe this is the authentic Asian part of the restaurant!?)  If I lived in the area, this might be a nice little place to toddle over to for a bite.  It's not enough to get me to the downtown area for supper out.",

It's a great place to hang out after work.  Overall I had an excellent experience.  First they have a great selection of wines that you don't typically see other places.  I'm not sure if they are connected to the wine bar next door, but I appreciate that there was something different to choose from.  We ordered a selection of dishes.  The low point was the Wood Fired Grill Plate which was just so/so.  Everything else was delicious, particularly the corn dogs.   We live a block away so I am sure that we will become regulars.",

I feel like there are a lot of Yelpers out there who will just go somewhere, pick up on one bad thing and then bash a place or will have one good experience and go rave about a place.  That being said, I really enjoy The Clever Koi and i've been a few times now.    I eat a lot of traditional Asian (mostly Japanese) cuisine and i liked everything i ordered (which was a lot). The Chinese long beans with crispy duck tongue was bright in flavor with a subtle smoky finish.  We tried all of the steam buns and while i did enjoy them all i thought the lamb pastrami and pekin duck were the best. The smoked pig face kimchi dumplings pretty my blew my mind.  I wasn't such a huge fan of the smoked octopus but i generally prefer octopus in raw or ceviche form.  Oh and not to forget, these guys know how to make some serious adult beverages. I like old fashions, sazeracs, manhattans, etc. but ended up having a couple of their \"Enablers\" as well as the \"Donny Wang Fizz\".    This place certainly adds something to the area that was missing and i wouldn't be surprised to see another location open up soon because this place.  This is my new go to when a friend asks for a recommendation.",

I got a Paloma which was okay. We ended up having to wait at least 40 minutes after our appetizer to get our dinner... They were busy but didn't think it should've been that bad of a wait. The food was greasy at best. It was very oily which made it slimy. The chow mein has good flavor. The pad Thai lacks major flavor. Our waitress was nice and gave us a discount for the delay in our food. Appreciated that she at least noticed that. Unfortunately left a little disappointed.

The chicken and waffles, pork belly and soft shell crab were all excellent. I had a dark and stormy for $8 and it was refreshing if not strong.

    "text": "Honestly? I'm not sure how you can improve upon perfection. Color me impressed!  We were in town visiting my parents, but we took a day and met up with a friend from college who has been living in Arizona for a while, and he suggested that we meet up here as he's been wanting to try it.  I can't speak for him, but I think he really enjoyed it. I know we did!  We arrived about 20 minutes before him and ordered a couple of drinks and the duck fat sriracha wings while we waited. Oh, the deliciousness and, not overly messy like some wings....When he arrived, we decided to just order a bunch of small plates and share. It was a little tight, considering that we sat at the bar, but we made it work. Between the three of us, we had the Tuna Chips, Red Miso Seared Kobe, Gojuchang Grilled Octopus, and each of the steamed buns. We ended with a banana bread pudding type thing for me and a date cake type of thing for our friend.  Everything was delicious! The wings had just the right amount of heat, as did the octopus. We were able to taste the flavors through the heat, which many restaurants, IMHO, overlook in favor of simply having a spicy dish on the menu, because it's trendy. The kobe beef was very tender. The tuna chips were a little bland for me, but then I prefer thinner cut tuna as in sushi, versus thick cuts as in poke. The steamed buns were amazing and you really can't go wrong with whichever you choose. The chicken and waffle one was definitely interesting. My banana dessert thing came with a small ramekin of caramel, which made it even better. It was like small banana bread pudding balls that you could dip in the caramel, or drizzle the caramel over the balls and fork 'em. I opted for dunking because.....caramel. LOTS OF CARAMEL. The date cake, while yummy, just wasn't my thing.  All in all, the flavors of each dish held their own yet melded nicely with one another. Even with the spicy dishes, the heat didn't overpower the food. My husband had beers, my friend drank wine and I had delicious hand crafted cocktails. The service was very prompt, our server/bar tender was extremely helpful in explaining and recommending items on the menu, and was just downright friendly. Although this place is more of what I consider an upscale restaurant, the service (at least at the bar) was as if we were old friends who had stopped in after a long absence.  I would definitely recommend the Clever Koi and I will definitely be back.   8/2017",

Food: We ordered the Chinese long beans, pork belly bun, soft shell crab bun, the duck fat wings, and the corn dumplings to start. I'm a pork belly fan, and that bun was wrapped around the most delectable slab of pork I've had in a while. The long beans were beautifully presented, and delicious. The wings weren't as spicy as anticipated, but were tender and tasty. Entrees all around were the pork belly ramen, and again, the pork belly was perfectly done. Ramen broth had great flavor.  Service: Attentive. The person that took our order never came back, but our water glasses were filled throughout the meal, and staff checked in on us as they delivered the food.   Cost: Well-priced for the food they offer.   Overall: Would happily come back and try other dishes we missed out on in this trip.",

    "text": "Clever Koi concluded my weekend in AZ, and I couldn't have asked for a better place to have lunch before hitting up the airport. I was initially supposed to go to dinner at Clever Koi on Friday when I arrived in Phoenix. Due to circumstances out of our control, my friends and I weren't able to make it to dinner there. I'm so glad that we got to have a second chance.   Clever Koi was located in an artistically designed establishment. The restaurant interior was unique as well. The decor was trendy but totally reminded me of something out of That 70s Show with a modern twist. It had a long bar toward the back of the restaurant and an open kitchen.   Our server was awesome! I didn't catch his name, but I do know he was from Omaha. He was super friendly and personable. He was very attentive and checked on us often. I also appreciated that he spent some time guiding us through the menu. He had many favorites off the menu that he shared with us, which was a good sign that he stood by the quality of Clever Koi's food.   Clever Koi has a happy hour menu from 11am - 6pm EVERYDAY. That was unheard of where I'm from back in Cali. The regular menu looked solid and had an expansive selection of Asian fusion dishes. If I was from the area, I would totally frequent Clever Koi and try many things off the menu.   I had a soft shell crab steamed bun and pork ramen, which I both enjoyed. I haven't had a steamed bun that wasn't made with pork belly (although Clever Koi does offer a pork belly steamed bun), so the soft shell crab was such a nice change. The soft shell crab was a good portion, and it was topped with Asian flavored mayos and pickled veggies. The pork ramen was great. There were so many complex flavors to it. Can't say that I've had ramen with kimchi, for example, which was one of the main ingredients. What was also different about Clever Koi's ramen was the poached egg, as opposed to a soft boiled egg that is typically served at ramen houses. Lastly, I didn't expect that the pork belly would be so crispy! This also isn't a typical way that pork belly is prepared for ramen.",

The menu was simple and had a variety of things to eat and try. We started off with an amazing tuna chips appetizer as well as three steamed buns: the soft shelled crab, pork belly and the chicken and waffle one. All the steamed buns were delicious and flavourful but I personally liked the pork belly steamed bun which was sweet because the hoisin sauce while my girlfriend's favourite was the soft shelled crab, it was a bit tangy and it paired super well with the crab itself. The customer service was pretty great as well, our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The Pork Ramen was pretty average, but i appreciated the thick and chewy noodles.  The Shaking Beef was okay but nothing special  TLDR; apps were great, main dishes were alright and place looked nice",

    "text": "Clever Koi is the type of restaurant I like to be careful about. Establishments that sacrifice things like sequence of service, quality of food, or efficiency of space. I'm disappointed with Clever Koi because it seems like they brush dangerously close to all three of these sacrifices in order to maintain a trendy atmosphere.   1. I arrived to Clever Koi at around 7:45. The parking lot was packed and we were lucky to grab a spot as someone was leaving. Upon entering the establishment, it was clear that they were approaching capacity because every table was taken and the wait for 2 was 45 minutes. Luckily, we were able to grab two spots at the bar.   2. A very cute bartender quickly greeted us and got us drinks. His chipper attitude was pleasant and he seemed very nice. He saw that I checked in on Yelp and quickly got us two free buns as part of the Yelp kick-back coupons. My friend got the Chicken and Waffle bun and I got the crab bun - both very good and arrived amazingly fast.   3. We gave our order and waited at least 40 minutes before I called someone over and asked where our food was - this was the worst part. The bartender did apologize and was very attentive to our drinks, but we still had to wait an extraordinary about of time for what seemed like very basic meals.   4. The kitchen is tiny. For the size of the restaurant and the amount of people they are committing to serve, the kitchen is way to small. You don't sacrifice kitchen space for a larger dining room when you have a complex menu - that just means you're going to be making people wait for your mediocre food and extend your wait time to unreasonable amounts.   5. Okay - calling the food mediocre might be a little harsh. But it certainly wasn't worth possibly waiting 40 minutes for a table and then another 40 minutes for the food to come out. We ended up taking the food to go and the manager comped the check, which was nice. However, no amount of comps makes up for a bad experience.   I probably won't return here. Nothing about the experience made it worthwhile enough for a second chance.",

Their pork ramen bowl is his go-to every time and I swear he could eat that forever if he only had one option to choose for the rest of his life.  I, too, love many options on their menu. They have delicious sriracha wings as an appetizer, an excellent spicy duck curry that I swear by and sweet banana hush puppy things for dessert.   Everything is amazing. There hasn't been anything I've order that I haven't enjoyed.",

We opted to try the tuna chips and steam buns as an appetizer. We ordered the pork belly, crab, and chicken and waffle one. The tuna chips were my favorite appetizer! The pork belly bun was delicious and I would absolutely get that one again! The other two were ok, I was disappointed in the flavors and the waffle was soggy, so neither were as great as the pork belly, so I would not order those again.   For lunch we shared the chicken katsu sandwich and a shrimp pad Thai. Game changer you guys- both were incredible! I highly recommend both entrees and the fries! Holy wow, will definitely order again.   Our server was nice and knowledgeable. We will absolutely be back.",

    "text": "TLDR; if it weren't for the ramen, this would be a higher rated review. The ramen was disappointing but everything else was good!  We picked this place because it got voted as best Ramen Shop in Arizona so we wanted to see if it could live up to the hype. We came kind of late on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy and were seated immediately.   If you check in on Yelp, you can get a free steamed bun but it's only one check in per table. We decided on the Pork Belly Bun, and ordered the Brussels Sprouts, Pork Ramen, and Kimchi Cheeseburger.   I was a bit worried about the service because I read a lot of negative reviews that it could've been better. But we didn't wait long for food and they checked in on us every now and then.   Pork Belly Bun: This was so good. They stuff a fat slab of pork belly in between a steamed bun. The pork belly is just slightly crispy along the edges and the bun compliments all the fat on the meat.   Brussels Sprouts: This had an interesting Asian twist, in a good way. I usually expect the vegetable to be cooked in some form of balsamic vinegar. It was a good dish to share between people.  Kimchi Cheeseburger: In my opinion, the burger was average. It isn't spicy if you're worried about that. I didn't expect them to put slices of daikon in the burger so that was a nice surprise. The fries and the gojuchang aioli were probably the best part of this dish.   Pork Ramen: This was not what we were expecting. The soup base tasted more like pho then actual ramen. The best thing in this dish were the thick slabs of pork belly and the carnitas.   Overall, if you're looking for good ramen, I do not recommend this place. But this place does have happy hour daily and a cocktail menu. If I were to visit again, I'd aim for those.",

    "text": "So I wanted to hate this place, given the past 2 times I've come it's been a 2 hour wait either due to the rain restricting patio usage or big business events which ended up causing  me to find another restaurant. However, when I came to this establishment this past Friday I ended up having one of the best dining experiences I've had in Phoenix.  Ambiance: When you walk in, the ambiance to me seemed somewhat minimalist. Nice modern wooden furniture in a low light romantic setting. The outside patio is also really cute next to these plants and beams above. We ended up opting to sit at the bar as we were both hungry and seating was available immediately. Pro tip: call ahead and see what the wait is going to be like. On weekends there can be some pretty long waits.  Drinks: Sitting next to the bar was a real treat. These guys take their cocktails very seriously. Our bartender/server was so nice and friendly despite having to man a long line of people. He also was quiet the showman when mixing drinks. Pouring the boozy concoctions with an open Boston shaker so you could see the liquids coming in and out. All of the drinks we had were amazing! The level of detail and display from drinkware to the garnishes was stunning. I like smoky drinks so of course my favorite cocktail was Up In Smoke.   Food: I have been on a hunt to find a ramen place to replace my current go to spot in Phoenix and I think I found it. I ordered what ended up being some of the tastiest and tenderest ramens I've had in a long time. We also got a bowl of pad Thai and a soft shell crab bun that was heavenly. I could eat those soft shell buns all day.  All in all, the exotic food, exceptional cocktails, great service and ambiance make this place a five star experience for me. I can not wait to be back for happy hour to have more of this places amazing options in food and cocktails!",

Clever Koi has the presence of a wonderful chef in Chef Anthony.  I've been here twice now and purposely stayed closer to the Koi than my clients to eat the food.  Today was Szechuan Catfish.  I'm not a huge catfish person, but I'm chef's recommendation I tried it.  Holy s$*t.  One of the best things I've ever eaten. The fish was delicate, the heat hit just right. In layers with a build up. Snow peas for crunch and shiitake and Chinese eggplant.  Even the cilantro served a purpose. Try this. Try the crispy duck leg. Try the soft shell crab steamed bun and tuna chips.  The food, the service and just the friendly faces almost made me forget it will be 120 degrees in Phoenix soon.  The soup tasting will have to wait until winter!!!  Thanks chef Anthony. Like I told you tonight, \"you cook the way o would cook if I knew how to cook better.\"   See you in a few weeks         **.  Been 6 times, which is a lot considering I live in Texas.   Haven't had a bad dish and I order something different every time.  Had Pork Ramen and calamari fries last night.  Aside from stellar food, the servers are attentive and amazing.",

Okay first things first, they have happy hours throughout the day till 6 pm mostly week days. They give a FREE bun ( your choice of protein) for Yelp check in.   Now coming to the food, not so happy with the pork ramen. I just felt the broth was too thick, it didn't had the rich touch to it. Too gingery in taste to be precise. However, the pork katsu was heavenly. Very mellow and crispy outside. Pork bun was average. Xo noodles were good in taste but it had too much of fried onions and garlic all around.   Above all this, the best seller was TUNA CHIPS and it was solid good. The raw and soft flavor of tuna with some spice and guacamole. OMG that's my new favorite here.  This place is slightly higher in prices. We paid around 36$ (excluding tips) for the 3 items. The presentation of food and ambience is heavenly. Not all but some items are to die for. Rest average taste. However, I will be coming back to try some their other items for sure. Because this place is definitely promising.  Bdw they have an open kitchen yet the place is super CLEAN.",

    "text": "This place has a great ambiance, staff are really cool, when I first went with a large group of around 8 people, we had to wait for 30-40 minutes to get our food served . If you go in a smaller group they are relatively fast.  They have a very simple Lunch Menu, you need to select the type of Rice/ Noddle's , Meat, Veggies, Sides.  I love fried rice with Eggs, Lemongrass chicken,  Mushroom, Kimchi and Pickled ginger combination. I once went to eat dinner and found the appetizers expensive and with very less quantity. Overall, if you have ample amount of time for lunch and you want to have good fired rice this is the place you should try out for sure.",

They also have an interesting and exciting mix of hand crafted cocktails. It has a comfortable modern setting with a nice long bar and expansive patio that faces Central.   We stopped in for happy hour the other day and were pleasantly surprised with the prices and variety of cocktails and eats. We started with the beets, they came with cucumber, pickeled ginger, bean curd and a lemongrass vinaigrette. It was beautifully plated, but the amount of soy was so overwhelming it was difficult to eat(and the beets weren't completely ripe). For the noodle bowl we tried the roasted pork, it came with bacon, mustard greens, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms and a soft egg. It was delicious. I had to try the steamed buns and went for the squid sausage that the bartender recommended. It was amazing and I loved the aioli it was dressed in.  I had \"The Enabler\" which was hickory whiskey, grilled lemon juice, burlesque bitters. It had a slow smoke flavor that stayed in my mouth long after the drink was done.  The bartenders were awesome, we had a great experience and will definitely be back.",

The sauce helped make the dish and I had a weird love for the mushrooms that were in the dish too.   As for the desserts.. I hope I remember mine forever. The banana fritters were the best dessert I've ever had. The soft dough with five spice sugar, the bananas that seemed to be melting, and the red miso caramel had me almost crying in-between bites.    I checked out the happy hour menu and I definitely wanna go back again.",

My son and I shared the Kimchi Fried Rice with duck, and Pork Belly Ramen. Both were magnificent. We also all shared the Tuna Chips with Wasabi Guacamole and Calamari Fries appetizers. Every item we tried was seasoned beyond expectation! It was a flavor explosion with every bite, and they were reasonably priced as well! It's hard to satisfy a party of 5. Great job, Clever Koi!",

The first time around I ordered soft shell steamed bun, tasted AMAZING! From what I remembered it was fried and what made it amazing was their sauce that came with the steamed bun. I also ordered their top orders which was the pork belly ramen. Again, the flavor was amazing!!! The pork is crispy, it comes with egg, and kimchee and of course the ramen.  The second time I visited, I ordered their pork steamed bun, again their sauce and how the pork is cooked makes it the best! And for my meal I ordered their seafood ramen soup. Their noodle is more of a udon soup rather than ramen but still tasted good! The seafood inside the soup was fresh, not over cooked either. The best part of going to this place is their service. They are quick to serve and will take good care of you especially Mike whom does a nice job making sure you are taken care of. Good job, Mike, the cooks, and the owners who thought of putting their own twist to Asian style cooking!!",

I picked up a menu to study prior to ordering. We ended up splitting the seafood hot pot, lamb pastrami and Peking duck steamed buns, smoked \"pig face\" dumplings and Chinese long beans. While the hot pot was good, I probably wouldn't order it again (but I'm not a huge soup person, unless it's pho). The house bacon lured me to order the Peking duck, and while it was delicious on its own it wasn't as amazing as the lamb pastrami. Good gravy that meat rocked! The pig face dumplings are packed with guanciale and is absolutely heavenly paired with kimchi. The long beans with crispy duck tongue were as awesome as it sounds--the lightly battered and fried tongues taste slightly like mushrooms and melt in your mouth.  Overall, we were both impressed with Cleaver Koi. The food was great and reasonably priced. The music was hip but not too loud. While there is outside seating, it's far too cold to enjoy. Regardless, I'm already planning my next meal for when I return.",

From the service, to the ambiance, music, good positve vibe, and most of all, the FOOD! This is what I call a True fusion of different Asian dishes with American and other cuisines.   It was a little late so I ordered the Soft Shell Crab from The Small Plates menu, which was served with julienned green apple, smoked daikon radish, fingerling potato, and buttered panang sauce. It was a total explosion of wonderful savory flavors in my mouth, not to mention, the texture. This dish really left a good impression in my mouth and my mind. I also ordered the Chicken and Waffle, a kimchi waffle with scallions, and chili maple. It was surprisingly good. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and I will be back to try the other offerings on their menu.",

We were surprised at the size of the place. Very small w a larger bar area.   After our 45m wait, we were seated and forgot about for at least 20 more mins. Even after finally getting a server she was not very attentive.... dropped off menus... never asked about if we had been there before or made any suggestions.  I dislike that. A little small talk is needed. I dont like to feel like a number, next guest.  Overall, the food wasnt anything to write home about. I actually disliked the ramin I got.   I dont recommend this place...other places in the area are better in terms of service and food",

    "text": "We went with a group of 5- would highly recommend coming with a large group so you can try everything  Would get again: the ramen! Absolutely delicious, the poached egg was perfect. The dumplings were moist & perfect, with a nice touch of spice. The house made sriacha was an added bonus. Would also recommend the steamed buns (the bottom two on the list- pork bacon? And lamb?) can't remember. But also very good  For me, the katsu is not my cup of tea. It was actually very good but I do not prefer fried chicken meals. My bf, however, loved it.   This place is actually easier for picky eaters to enjoy than I would have expected. We will definitely be back.  Also! Relatively cheap, we were all stuffed & paid twenty a person with tip! The ambience is pretty laid back & the lighting isn't too dark which I absolutely hate about Asian restaurants.",

Everything I've tried is good so far, and I've almost tried everything on the menu. I don't like the pig face dumpling as much, actually prefer the other dumplings. I love the stream buns, especially the chicken waffle and the pork belly steam buns. Their ramen and seafood hot pot is excellent, but wasn't impressed by their duck dishes.",

    "text": "I love this place! If I could give it more stars I certainly would. I had dinner there last night which was the 3rd time I'd eaten there in about a month and as always, everything exceeded my expectations. They have got it down pat, amazing food, awesome service, (both front of the house and back) and owners and employees who are passionate about their restaurant! This was my first time sitting at the kitchen bar, where I could see the guys in the kitchen who work so hard. It is obvious watching them prepare the food that they are completely engaged and dedicated. Chef Jared Porter is one of Phoenix's best, if not the best, in my opinion. He continues to create fresh, flavorful dishes using exceptional ingredients put together in such interesting ways. I crave this food, it's like comfort food without being heavy like most comfort food tends to be. We started out with a couple of the \"small plates\", Tuna Chips and the Black Bean and Celery Root Pancakes. For the record, I have ordered these the last 3 times I've been there, they are that amazing! For dinner we shared the Fried Forbidden Black Rice, what a perfect pairing of flavors, slightly sweet, incredibly flavorful without being salty or spicy. Honestly, I love their flavor combinations as much as anything else about the place. We ordered the Grilled Stone Fruit dessert which totally hit the spot, not overly sweet, but sweet enough, with just the right balance of sweet and savory. Not only is the food amazing, but it seems as though every person on staff is happy to be there and cares about the guests. This might be my favorite restaurant, at least until I try their new spot when it opens in Gilbert in the early fall.",

    "text": "This Asian fusion restaurant blew me away!  We came in for lunch for our first time and tried out their tasty little build-your-own-bowl options. First off, the place is hip and beautifully-decorated, cozy yet chic. It's a very nice spot in Phoenix. It's set up with an open-kitchen look, so it's fun to watch the chef-owners cooking the food with fresh ingredients and lively attitudes. The food was AMAZING. BEST pork belly steamed bun I've ever had in my life--it was with just the right amount of sauce and crispy, flavorful, and crackling with tasty fat! I also had the stir fry chow mein with steak. They know how to cook their meat here! Their steak is amazing: tender and juicy and bursting with flavor. My partner had their dashi broth with noodles and it was light, refreshing, and unique. These guys know how to make sophisticated and inventive flavor profiles that are still respectful of their traditional bases and still reminiscent of that delicious Asian comfort food we all know and love. I will come here again and again; this is our new favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  (Pro-tip: come from weekday lunch! It's PACKED during dinner time and a reservation is highly recommended! Also very loud in the evenings!)",

The chicken and waffle dumpling was way over the top and then I washed that down with the seafood pot. AMAZING. I washed all of it down with two cocktails which were also insanely great. The vibe felt like it should be in LA or San Diego and the food was easily the best thing I have had traveling in a long time. I would absolutely eat here again and probably will before I bounce.

A peach fritter should be easy here is a suggestion how to do make it if you have not already fixed it,  use fresh peaches probable from costco, cut into wedges, dust with cornstarch and use a tempura batter made with peach nectar and a little vanilla  I hope this helps and good luck with a great concept",

Service during the meal wasn't horrible but we went through all the water and was never asked if we wanted a refill. Our server did answer questions and gave recommendations.

I don't eat meat so I wasn't interested, but he liked it.  Restaurant is nicely decorated. The only thing that I didn't like was the smoke. The restaurant is an open floor plan so the kitchen is right there. Unfortunately, the smoke from the kitchen easily wafts throughout the entire restaurant.

Also, you can't get anything from the dinner menu at lunch so we will return for dinner to try that delicious looking shrimp & scallop appetizer.",

Plus this open fireplace that they use for cooking the meats. We were watching as they cook this meat and let the juices drip onto whatever they were cooking underneath it.  Mouth watering!  I had the ramen noodle soup and a beer. The soup was amazing. They drop a egg in there with some pork and other goodies. On happy hour it's only like $5, come on that's awesome.

    "text": "Clever Koi is a solid restaurant that could definitely become stunning with a few changes. Parts of the restaurant were lovely and parts were underwhelming.  I'm going to lead with what went right on our visit. Service was prompt and good, just the right balance of being attentive without being overwhelming.   The ambiance was stellar, I felt like I was somewhere along the California coast. We sat in the patio area which had comfy seats, and well groomed and taken care of plants.   The bao style buns were perfectly executed - we had the soft shell and catfish. They came with a soy like sauce which I felt was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the dish. These pair well with their green house sriracha.   The house hot sauces are delicious, not to spicy but just enough kick with actual flavor. We found the red to be smoky and the green to be sweet.   The bao were pricey, but did at least deliver. They offer three for $12.50 which puts you at $4.17 a piece. The problem is when you have two people, usually you need four and get stuck purchasing the fourth for $4.50. I would recommend any above three be priced at $4.17 so you don't feel overcharged.   The corn dumplings were good and presented nicely, but I just cannot get behind the $10 price tag - $7.50 would be closer to their value. The dumplings were also served in a very large bowl only half full.   The Pad Thai was our least favorite.. it's not that the ingredients chosen weren't fresh and of quality.. it was the execution. Nothing was overcooked, but the sauce did not deliver. The sauce was a muddy mess between a Pad Thai you would expect and a satay sauce that fell into the mix. I much prefer a more classic Pad Thai, which is a perfect balance of heat, sweet and tang. The toasted peanut pieces, strong cilantro and tang of lime were missing here. I wish the menu clarified this dish was more of a satay sauce, because I would have gone another route.   All proteins in the Pad Thai were extra. I didn't feel the 4 medium shrimp were quite enough for a $5 add in. I would like to see 6 shrimp or 4 extra large for this dish.  The dessert selection made it tough to choose. They make their own house mochi and today it was Fruity Pebbles - how creative. There was also a pineapple upside down cake and banana fritters. We opted for the banana fritters.  The banana fritters were coated with sugar and spice like donut holes and served with a salty caramel. I would have liked to have seen less sugar on the outside of the fritters, because I felt it limited my use of the delicious caramel sauce. The ice cream was extra and for $4.50 you got two mini scoops which accounted for about a scant 1/2 cup serving. I would expect to pay no more than $3 for the portion of ice cream which was of average quality.  No drinks were ordered and the bill came to $59.19 with tax. My recommendation is go for the buns, ambience and skip the Pad Thai.",

    "text": "Unique Asian fusion establishment. We came during Restaurant Week on a Saturday, so the place was hopping. Wait was 30-40 minutes, but we had some cocktails while we waited.  The cocktail menu is certainly extensive and we each had two of the specialties - I can't remember the names offhand and the cocktail menu isn't available online but they were all novel combinations. I liked both of my drinks and one my wife chose was too sweet for her - but I don't blame the mixologist for that.  The first thing I'll say about the food is to NOT do the restaurant week menu - it is absolutely a rip off. For $33, they give you food that would on the normal menu be $30 or less! Most places where that was the case throw in a drink with the menu, but this one did not. After we realized the math worked that way, we ordered off the main menu.  The calamari fries were excellent, not too chewy with good dipping sauces. We split all four steam buns (ordered 3 initially but checking in on yelp got us a free one!) The pork belly was probably my favorite with its savoriness but all of them were very well done. The chicken n waffle has the bun itself replaced by a waffle. Kimchi cauliflower was a surprising favorite.  XO noodles (my entree) had well-developed flavor to them (a bit on the spicy side, but not excessively so. The ramen (my wife's) was filling and the broth was everything we could have wanted.  Food (and certainly cocktails) would probably merit a ~4.5 stars but I round down because of the blatant restaurant week mispricing as well as slow service - particularly at the bar (it took us ~15 minutes to get a check once our table was ready so we could close out from the bar).",

I had to add lots of pepper to add flavor to it (I can't do spicy... so the fact that I added lots of pepper says a lot). The kimchi fried rice was not too bad, but not great either. Both entrees had generous portion sizes. I wish the food tasted as good they looked.  Everything else was decent.

Ordered Tuna Chips (Ahi crudo/wasabi guacamole/rice paper chips/bonito aioli), Calamari Fries (mint/furikake/yuzu aioli), Pork Belly Steamed Buns (peanuts/cilantro/hoisin), Roasted Corn Dumplings (sofrito/yuzu marinated tomato/Thai basil/Harissa cream), Short Rib Dumplings (pickled onions/celery leaf salad/shiitake dash/porcini oil), and Seafood Hot Pot (udon/shrimp/calamari steak/scallop/catfish/scallion/cilantro/lime).  The Tuna Chips and Calamari Fries were my favorites, the others were just okay. The highly recommended Seafood Hot Pot was bland to me, it desperately needed some salt or fish sauce. The service was great and attentive. Will give it another try if I ever in the area and try Duck Curry (udon/roasted potato/pickled peppers/peanut/cilantro) and hopefully will be tastier than the Seafood Hot Pot.",

I personally like to sit at the bar, because you get an upfront view of all the fun cocktails they make.  My favorite bartender by far is Sarah.  She's incredibly knowledgeable about the cocktails and food (she's recommended many things that have been spot on), and she's also really personable and funny!    Some of my favorite things that she has recommended are the Lemongrass Swizzle cocktail (she nudged me to try it with gin instead of vodka, and holy moly was that a good choice!), the Tuna Chips (crudo tuna on a rice paper chip, nachos style), and the Szechuan Catfish. The catfish in particular blew me away!!  It was so tender and flavorful.....I could go back just for that any day!  I absolutely LOVE dining at the Clever Koi, so if you are ever in the neighborhood you should check it out!! :)",

We started with the Galbi and Calamari my husband's two favorite dishes. The galbi was thinly cut and extremely salty. It didn't have the familiar sweetness at the end that you expect. The calamari was cooked well, but the abundance of salt kill the vibes. You did get a hint of yuzu at the end.   Hubs chose the pork ramen and I the Katsu Sandwich. The Ramen was a spicy southwestern take on traditional ramen. The star of ramen is ALWAYS the broth, but this was a picante, overly salted noodle bath. It lacked the balance that a good bowl has.   I was super excited to try the katsu sandwich, because Im always tempted to go on an LA run, for a proper Japanese sandwich. The sandwich consisted of a mu pork katsu cutlet, mustardy slaw and a vinegary/soy/oystery sauce. The Katsu cutlet  was cooked perfectly, but the sauce clashed with the slaw creating a vinegary fight.  I ate one piece of the 4 and took the rest home. I took the bread and slaw off and ate the Katsu as it was. We tried. ** shrugs**   Well if you don't know, now you know...",

They have a fab list of classics on the happy hour menu, but last night's penicillin tasted like straight lemon juice- no hints of ginger or peaty scotch. Switched to a negroni which was just meh.   The place gets busy, so maybe that explains why service was a bit scattered. They accidentally brought us someone else's order... 3 times. We finally got our fries and have to say they were tasty.

It was super unprofessional and it honestly made me not want to go back.   The food is great and Sarah built me the best drink, on the fly. Spicy passion gin is my jam. Sarah was absolutely a sweetheart and if I ever did go back to this place, it would only be because of her. Thank you Sarah!!!  It deserves five stars because that's how delicious it is, but it's getting four because of how uncomfortable I felt watching somebody get reprimanded.",

The only thing I didn't like was the \"buns.\" Please don't expect them to be actual steam buns like I did. Again this is the urban experience, these are Asian inspired tacos. I liked and disliked them all at the same time. I tried the soft crab and I don't like that it was fried and stuffed in the bun taco. It was just awkward for me.   I had the lemon ramen with added heat and hats off to the kitchen staff. I love heat and I felt it. I loved it.",

Whisky and champagne, who would ask for anything else? Be sure to try this drink when you come to this restaurant. When using yelp be sure to check in to get your free steamed bun and I got the pork steamed bun which was amazing! The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the home made sauces added more spice and flavor to the pork belly bun. For my entree I ordered the pork ramen. It's not your typical Japanese ramen so don't expect that but it was sooo good! Had lots of pork belly and the broth was amazing.

The restaurant is asian fusion so I honestly didn't know what to expect ramen wise.   To my surprise the ramen was actually really good, albeit a tad too salty to my liking. The broth was very rich, noodles chewy, and the pork belly delicious. I was surprised how the ramen has pieces of fried and broiled pork belly. The fried pork belly had a crunch while the broiled belly was so soft it fell apart.   I also checked in and had the soft shell crab bun. That item in my opinion wasn't amazing although worth a try. It had cole slaw with a thousand island like sauce.   The mai Thai is very strong here fyi.   If you want a place with solid food and good aesthetics. Along with  strong drinks this is the place to go!  FYI go to happy hour specialty drinks are $9 and the ramen was $13",

Inside is very well decorated. It's an open kitchen, everybody was able to see the chef cooking and servers running around. I feel  with us being so close to the kitchen and the music was a little loud, we can barely hear our conversation.  Food is a bit pricy compare to other ramen places. My sister and I ordered the Brussels Sprouts as for the appetizer. Then we ordered Pork Ramen and my younger sister ordered the Shaking Beef. I think the Brussels Sprouts is delicious and very light as for starters. Although I'm a bit disappointed on the Pork Ramen, I think its a little bland. I wish it was a bit spicier or at least more flavors to it. Even though I tried to put some of their sriracha, but still no flavors. I've tried a few ramen places and this isn't the best. I tried some of my younger sister's shaking beef which it was cook perfectly.   Overall is nice and good experience. I would come back to try their rice dishes instead.",

VENUE: Parking gone be a breeze and the decor be popping them millennial hipster vibes.   Gotta fix them short ribs if you want them 5 shiny ones. Overall not bad.",

Lunch time was probably a mistake, it was fairly busy which affected the service a bit. However, everyone was really nice. The decor in this place is pretty cool, it feels nice enough for a date but also casual enough for yoga pants.   I ordered the katsu sandwich with a side of fries. The katsu sandwich was cut into almost tea sandwich sized pieces which was actually pretty enjoyable. The katsu itself was fried well, the flavor was delicate and not overly greasy. The fries, well they were fries. I also had the pork belly steamed bun. If I could fit 10 of those inside my mouth I would. They were that good. My boyfriend ordered the ramen. It was a huge portion and featured carnitas as well as some of that delicious pork belly. I mention a ton of meat options, but it should be mentioned that the menu also features many vegetarian dishes!",

After putting all the fancy stuff in it (meat, egg, bok choi, etc) - it comes out to a still-acceptable 10 or 11 bucks. Delicious. Also, the pork belly bun is also excellent.  Every time we've been there, we were greeted warmly by the owner and had good service at the bar. The bartenders are also excellent there. I really like the French 95(?) cocktail - a mix of champagne and whiskey. Weird but mighty good.  They have a good discount on cocktails at happy hour, too.    Hands down, the Clever Koi is great stuff. I go there as often as I can!",

The process is simple but the server is happy to explain it to you. You pick you noodle or rice and then add your proteins and veggies. They also have some small bites available. We started with the chicken and waffle bun which was delicious. My coworker also had the pork belly steamed bun. I ordered the chow mien with lemongrass chicken and bok choy. My impression was that it was just ok. The whole dish seemed a little salty for my tastes and the bok choy a little bitter. The chicken in my bowl however was spot on. My coworker had ramen noodles with chicken broth, chicken, tofu, all the available veggies and the soft egg. He ate every drop of it so it is safe to assume he enjoyed it. I will definitely go back here and try something else. I hoping to go on a Wednesday for the chicken Katsu bento box.  The service here was excellent, everyone was friendly and extremely efficient. The atmosphere is trendy yet comfortable.   Lunch for two was a bit pricey and ran us almost $45.00 not including the tip.",

The staff is very friendly and they work hard. This was our first time trying the happy hour, and it did not disappoint. We tried the kung pao wings and those were my favorite thing on the happy hour, and only $6.   We also tried the spicy tuna nacho-type appetizer which was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of the rice cracker. The kimchi fried rice with duck was AMAZING. No lie, that's the best fried rice I've ever had. We were able to order everything gluten-free as my wife has recently gone gluten-free.  Overall, this is my favorite Asian Fusion restaurant in Phoenix by far. Keep it up Clever Koi!",

The restaurant is next to some type of salon and wine place. We got sat at the patio and I love the decor - trendy, earthy, and very relaxing.   Our waitress wasn't the sweetest by any means, but we made due. We ordered the pork belly and duck steamed buns, the wood fired grill plate with steak, and the shrimp toasts. The pork belly steamed buns were good, the duck was not - way too dry and lacked flavor. The wood fired grill plate took forever to get to our table, but it was just ok. The shrimp toasts were ok too. We were full and had not left much on the plates for a doggie bag.  All in all - I definitely am happy that I came to try it out, but this whole Asian fusion trend is not working for me. Yes, I get the \"trendy\" ambiance, but I guess I expect what I grew up with at asian restaurants - big portions, lots of flavor and sauce, reasonably priced, and you leave with a doggie bag!",

I don't know... but what I do know is that what ever they're doing, they're doing it right.   I first came to CK about a month ago and it nearly, instantaneously became one of my favorite restaurants in PHX.  The Food:   The first thing that stood out were the Steamed Buns. I love steam buns and the ones here are very good. I think I've now tried all of them. The chicken and Waffle as well as the Duck stick out in my mind the most so I would say try those but none have disappointed.   As far as entree's go, I've had the Sweet & Sour (Chicken?) Rice Bowl... I thought I had pork but the menu on their website says it's chicken so whateve's, either way it was delicious.   The next time we came, I had the Mongolian Beef rice Bowl... I think the website menu is wrong because I don't see it on there but I know that's what I got because it was just last night. It was great but what sticks out in my mind is the thin slices of something... some kind of garnish perhaps, but either way this stuff was wriggling like they were alive... it was freaky and kind of cool at the same time. PS... it wasn't alive...   The Dranks:  They make Great cocktails.... The first time I tried the Guns N Rose' because... yeah GNR is the greatest band ever... A nod to CK on the naming... ya got me. It was very good. Not something I'd drink all the time but good.   I think the other drink I got was the Rye & Rum Old Fashioned... again, very good. I could have drank these all night long and then later made very questionable life choices.  They also have a very good craft beer selection. On my second visit I went with the THAT Brewery Road Rash IPA. I like when restaurants have local beer offerings and there were quite a few the night we went.  Let's Wrap it Up:   I didn't mention above but the presentation of the food and drink are very nicely done. Attractive without feeling pretentious. I love that. It's a cool place... the atmosphere is very chill and the service has been excellent both times we've been here.   All that said, I guess it doesn't really matter how you classify Clever Koi. At the end of the day, the only box they fit in for me is the box labeled awesome places to eat and drink in Phoenix. Cheers!",

I took my little 92 year old grandpa and all he could say was wow this is delicious so fresh & beautiful.    The lunch bowl was pretty large we couldn't finish it, they will charge you for extra broth but it's worth every dime.    The broccoli was fresh and defiantly al dente  I can't stand when veggies are limp and loose color that indicates to me that they at are over cooked.   The bathroom was clean and Nicely decorated.    We tried the banana fritters which were very tasty ! Crunchy on the outside rolled in a light sugar nice warm and fluffy on the inside filled with fragrant banana  Five little balls come in a serving  I live kind of far from there but I will most certainly be back",

They had a lot of interesting small plates that I wanted to try (duck fat siracha wings, tempura octopus, kimchi waffle and chicken, and kimchi fried rice with steak). Wings were alright nothing special, the tempura octopus was soggy, kimchi chicken and waffle was good, the fried rice wasn't bad. Dessert was really good though, had the banana bread fritters and I'd go back to get them and maybe try some other interesting items.   Overall I'd say it's not bad food but don't get your hopes up too high for some of those unique or interesting items because they might just come out really ordinary.   Oh but service was really good and I always appreciate that!",

Do not leave without trying the roasted pork belly and soft shell crab steam buns! For drinks my wife had a Phil Collins and I had an Enabler, both were delicious and unique and I highly recommend trying them.

I found this place to be very cool and trendy with good ambiance. We dropped by on a weekday so it wasn't overly busy. The staff was very friendly and provided great service. I really enjoyed the food. I had originally been craving sushi but the food definitely hit the spot! We ordered the calamari fries for an appetizer and we both really liked those. I ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp and it was extremely good! My bf got the lemon pepper chicken ramen and he really liked that as well. I had a bit of his and it was very tasty. I liked that the taste wasn't super overpowering. The flavoring was really well balanced. I think overall it was a great experience and we will absolutely be going back soon!",

    "text": "After months of wanting to go here, my girlfriend and I finally made the trip to Phoenix to try Clever Koi. The ambiance and overall decoration of the restaurant is modern and hip with a little asian flare. There is also outdoor seating with heat lamps for the colder months.   But the point of this review is to express how much I loved their food! We started with the kung pao wings that was super crispy and delicious as well as the steamed buns. The steamed buns were my favorite part of the meal because the pork belly was so crispy and tender, which complimented the soft bun. We both got ramen (lemonpepper chicken and pork) and they were both one if not the best ramen in the valley. The pork broth is super rich and flavorful with a good size portion. But my favorite of the two was the lemonpepper chicken, this may sound different than your typical pork/miso ramen, but it works amazingly.   Overall Clever Koi is one of the premier places in Phoenix to go to. My recommendation is to go during happy hour if you're trying to snag some deals ($8 pork ramen, $5 wings)",

And for my main meal i had the pork ramen. And that when i got sad. It needed more flavor. It was bland but it looked pretty. I was expecting it to be amazing, to be absolutely delicious. I'd been anticipating the broth to be the best. But it wasnt it was just alright. So i was a tad bit disappointed but its ok! Maybe i just need to give it another try with another dish.",

However I will say the wait is definitely worth it. I had the pleasure of meeting my friend Kathy for some nibbles and drinks before going a to watch her lovely brother sing in a holiday concert. We sat at the bar, which was also a treat because you get to watch and interact with the chefs. I will say watching them work their magic was memorizing. Oh before I go any further, I also got a nice surprise treat as I ran in to my fabulous former coworker Sam, whom I had not seen in person in YEARS! Now that alone was worth it. (thank you again Sam for treating Kathy and I to a round of drinks)  Kathy and I shared the pork belly buns along with the chicken and waffle buns. My lord who comes up with this stuff? I swear I could have had about 3 of each of them they were that good. The pork belly was nice and crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth with every bite. The chicken was also cooked to perfection and had the chili maple syrup gave it the little kick that you needed.  Needless to say I will be back again as I want to try EVERYTHING on the menu.

The chefs have managed to recreate famous asian dishes and have outstandingly  transformed them into their own. This place is definitely top notch.  For starters, my girlfriends and I ordered the tuna chips. Their tuna chips are perhaps one of my favorite tuna chips ever. The ahi tuna is fresh, the chips are light and have an airy texture, and the wasabi guacamole is perfect. I could eat this all day. We also had the black bean and celery root pancakes which I never thought I would like. Honestly, they were quite amazing. They were crispy and absolutely tasty. In addition, we had the calamari fries which weren't particularly amazing but still pretty good. We ordered one of each of the steamed buns, and they were all great. My favorite has always been the soft shell crab bun. The crab was fried and seasoned perfectly and paired well with the aoili and cucumber slaw. For our main dish, we had the duck curry, kimchi fried rice and pad thai. The duck curry was okay, nothing memorable about it. The kimchi fried rice was good however it didn't really taste much like kimchi - still pretty good though. The pad thai was not authentic pad thai but their version is great and was our favorite among the main dishes we ordered. Over all, I feel like Clever Koi appetizers/small plates are superior to their main dishes.   I didn't like Clever Koi before but it still managed to keep reeling me in. The restaurant is gorgeous, and the experience is always alluring.",

Bo Bites gotta have a go  We found buns in The Clever Koi We found buns in The Clever Koi We found buns in The Clever Koi We found buns in The Clever Koi  This place definitely drew my interest!  Very Clever indeed!  I attended with my foodie group so a lot of sharing.  We ordered a bunch of stuff, but I only remember what we ordered on my side of the table were the Peking duck and octopus bun, the katsui rice, gluten free and regular massamen udon noodles.   To start my Peking duck was very good except I didn't care much for the charred plum jam.  It just overpowered everything in the bun.  The octopus bun was okay too, I rather eat it nigiri style.  The chicken katsui rice was very good again, but again I thought the teriyaki sauce was just doused over too much.  I like to taste the other ingredients sorry.  My favorite which was not my main dish was the massamen udon noodles. The red curry broth really made this dish pop while the crunch of the nuts gave it texture.  The roast duck and potatoes just melted on your palates while the cilantro gave it a welcoming aroma! - Enjoy!  The place itself had an Asian flare with a modern gastropub feel.  Nice to hangout for a quick bite or to check out their specialty drinks, which they have plenty!  Service can be spotty, but every waiter/waitress has their day! - Enjoy!",

I love the feel of the place, even the outside patio area, which is where I want to dine one night, it just looks cool to me.  On the HH menu they have ramen for 5 bucks, never have had ramen before and not really being a person who eats soups (more of a curry, stew kind of girl) I thought eh for 5 bucks, why not try it. Well am I am glad I did!  The broth was good, and inside the ramen was roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and a soft egg, it looked soo good, picked up the chop sticks and went right at it! I popped the egg and let it get all happy in the broth, and picked up a piece of that bacon, omg the bacon is soo good. The broth to me needed something but Clever Koi makes their own sriracha sauce and added that to the broth and BAM! That did the trick!   For my 1st ramen experience, this was a great bowl of it! Now its left me craving more and can't wait to get back to it!",

    "text": "Asian fusion is usually hit or miss, but The Clever Koi is somewhere in the middle. Almost everyone at our table ordered the ramen, and that's what was recommended to me too. It was good and mostly made in a traditional style. However, they added kimchi to the dish, and that really threw off the taste. Ramen normally has either a plain soy broth, a rich pork broth, or a miso broth. All of these are mild in flavor. Sometimes you can have spicy ramen, and that is fine too. But the additional sour taste of kimchi didn't go well with it, in my opinion. Otherwise, the rest of the dish was good: noodles were not to stiff or soggy, and all the toppings aside from the kimchi were pretty traditional.  Service here was okay. The server was nice, but food did take a while to arrive.",

    "text": "I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.  First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.  Cleaver Koi is a very \"neat/cute\" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#6MLtRK4fGBKOt9g05P8XFg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.  My favorite item was the \"Pig Face\" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  We also tried the following notable things: Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.  Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink \"Hey Bartender\"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.",

We should have listened to our waiter that the catfish steamed bun was the best. I understand they were busy, but I feel like since we were a large group of 10 people they should have brought all of the appetizers out at once. I got the seafood hot pot. The rest of the group got the pork ramen or the duck curry. If you like spicy then this is the place for you! Loved the atmosphere and our server was super knowledgeable. He said the best thing on the menu is the duck curry. Although, I didn't try it. I would go back!just know that you are going to be there for a while especially on a weekend night.",

We waited over an hour for two appetizers and another hour for food. Two people at the table never got their orders and by that time it was already like \"ok, lets go.\" The waitress was apologetic and kept saying that they're getting a rush of orders (which was hard to believe as the place wasn't full), and comped a meal.

    "text": "Before writing this review, I've been to Clever Koi about four times. The first time was with a group of Asians, the other was to impress a friend from California, and another was because it became my go-to restaurant to catch up with an old friend. The fourth time I went with 10 people from the crew and that's where the fun happens.  Overall, if you want good, yet unique food at a central place in Phoenix, this is a great place to get your Asian fix. There are a lot of very trendy restaurants around this area but I have not found a better Asian one than this one. You can really feel the \"hip-ness\" of the place, with its contrasting blue bar fighting with the orange, elegant dining room.   To iterate, the restaurant was made by three not-Asian owners which is perfectly ok. As much as I would love to judge authenticity, this place isn't authentic Asian food but it doesn't have to be. This place has great food and because Asian flavors are so unique and flavorful, I can see why they decided to go with an Asian inspired restaurant.  When waiting for a seat, enjoy the visually pleasing cook books that are placed near the front of the restaurant. They have nothing to do with the food, but they are a good read.  I've eaten the steamed buns, the ramen, the duck curry and the seafood soup over the course of the three times I've been there. I can remember food very easily if it's truly exceptional.  Let me tell you, these guys nail pork belly so well. In both their buns and their ramen, their pork belly is textured on the outside and melty on your inside. Weird descriptions, but this is necessary for this type of pork belly. You want the outside to have a roasted feel and the inside to melt in your mouth. Think of it as really Asian bacon, but with a different goal: an amazing texture.",

The broth was way too salty and lacking flavor. 2.5  Sriracha wings: Not spicy at all, kind of sweet.

My husband likes to adventure out and order new things, this last time he tried the forbidden black rice bowl with chicken instead of shrimp...he said it's his new favorite. I almost forgot...Drinks!

    "text": "Just ate here for a friend's birthday tonight- lots to say.   Food: The food menu is not nearly as long as the beverage menu, which wouldn't have been a big deal (because they have AWESOME options) if I wasn't vegetarian and my friend a vegan. For such a trendy place I was expecting to have more than a couple options, but I made do and what I got was great. I think my dish was $12, and most plates were in the $11-$16 arena.  Drinks: The restaurant is owned by two guys with a lot of bar experience, and I hypothesize that the Clever Koi was originally a bar concept that was born a restaurant. They have a large selection of beers including a group of drafts on tap. Then, they have a long list of upgraded classic cocktails. THEN, they have a menu of probably... 20 specialized creations that are to die for. There are some wine options as well. Our drinks were delicious and instagram-friendly via complementary garnish/glass presentation. Win-win. It's important to include that you're looking at $8-$15 a cocktail.   Ambiance: SO COOL. The architectural design of the restaurant is admirable and inviting. Loads of natural light via window-walls. We were there in the evening, and the artificial lighting is perfectly done. Romantic, warm, and intimate. The styling is contemporary, and the bar is plotted in such a way that it almost creates its own exclusive space in the restaurant- my friends and I agreed that we would readily come back just for drinks.   Service: The owner came over to our table and spoke casually with us as we waited for the rest of our party. He was informative about the restaurant foundations in a very humble way, that made me feel very valuable as a customer. Our waiter also was kind, humble, and attentive. We had some less favorable staff interactions, which really is the only reason I couldn't give 5/5 stars. That and some inproportionally priced items on the menu (dumplings, small plates + certain cocktails).  Overall, a great dining experience. As a vegetarian, I probably wont come back for a meal, but I'll definitely be back for drinks!  OMG I almost forgot- their banana fritters are to die for. I don't care if you don't like bananas or never get dessert- you MUST get an order to share with your table.",

The staff is wonderful, always kind and attentive. The craft cocktails are so delicious and creative. The steamed buns and dumplings are to incredible, I suggest the pork belly. I've tried several  of the entrees but my all time favorite is the Thai Chili Beef - the crispy scallions OMG.   I recommend sitting at the back bar and watching the chefs, so fun! Definitely try this place, you won't be disappointed.",

While it was difficult to make a reservation, when I called I was advised that we could walk in and get a table or sit in front of the kitchen.   The food was exceptional! - we shared the mussels and the short-rib dumplings. Both amazing. The former is a substantial dish and the latter is quite small (but delicious).  - I had the Kimchi fried rice with chicken - delicious. - My better half had the Pad Thai  A lot of food but absolutely delicious (we are headed back on Thursday night). Can't say enough good things about this gem of a restaurant.   We had a nice bottle of wine and cocktails. The latter were wonderful.",

I expected it to be pretty busy since it was dinner time but I didn't expect to hear the wait time was over an hour. We decided to wait anyways and got seated in about 40mins. I ordered the mushroom dumplings which were a little over cooked and the vegetable ramen which tasted like it came out of a package and wasn't even warm & also lacked flavor. I was so hungry from the long wait to be seated plus it took about 35mins for my entree to come out which wasn't even satisfying. I was pretty disappointed with the overall experience and probably won't ever return.",

    "text": "The Clever Koi was a point of contention between my husband and I... you see, he knew I wanted to try it for a really long time, and he actually had the audacity to go there without me one night with friends.  How dare he!  I'm kidding... kind of.  I really was wanting to check out The Clever Koi since they first opened, and Jared really did go there without me, knowing damn well that I wanted to go.  But, he made up for it and took me there on a date a few weeks later... and then I went there with some work colleagues (without Jared) just the other night as well.    So, I'm now two visits down with many more to go... TCK's menu changed slightly between my visits, but I enjoyed everything I had.  Service was attentive, food - creative, tasty and filling.  There is something for everyone on the drink list.  There is indoor and outdoor seating. The ambiance is casual and comfortable and not too loud.  Highlights on the current menu in my eyes are: -Wood Grilled Octopus -Summer Corn Gyoza -Massaman Curry Noodles -Summer Corn Ramen Noodles  I highly recommend sharing / family style if you go with adventurous eaters... it's fun to taste a bunch of different things!  Kudos to the guys behind this place... crafty, clever, and keeping things fresh.  TCK is worth a visit (or several)!",

Food: I had the pork broth with pork belly. The broth was insanely unflavorful, and the housemade sriracha did not help ( i honestly would have preferred green lid sriracha. Just because it's house made does not mean that it's good.) The noodles were decent, but without a good broth, it had me reminiscing about the days I liked to eat spaghetti with just butter and salt--- and a little bit of nostalgia is not always a good thing. The pork belly was fried which was unusual to me, and they over cooked it so much it was embarrassing for me to eat (I gnawed on it when i took the first bite because I didn't realize how chewy it would be). Not even my fork and knife could salvage it.  Service: The service was average. The servers were apathetic and we had 3 or 4 waiters that all seemed lost and confused.  Again, it's a cute place that I wish I could love, but having had loads of Ramen before, if the broth isn't good, then I'm not coming back.",

Loved the ambience and the relaxed, modern decor. My friend had her service dog in training with her and the staff was awesome, very respectful and accommodating. We requested the patio and it was nice and cool outside with the misters. Very friendly service and awesome food! We each got a trio of the steamed buns. I had the soft shell crab, chicken and waffles, and pork belly for my selection. She opted for the crab for all three of hers. We also split an order of the calamari fries and ordered extra Yuzu aioli for dipping--amazing. They have a great selection of cocktails, beer, wine and sake. I had a Bellini and an IPA.

However, of you have anything else to do in a day, maybe you'd want to go some place else.  I believe we were forgotten about; sat at our table without being checked on for 40 minutes. When I asked if we could have our lunch to go because we needed to get back to work, it still took another 20 plus minutes for that to happen. I believe that they forgot to put in our order until I asked to make it to go. There was never an apology; I'm sorry that took so long, we messed up, or anything.. that is disappointing - as I am empathic to being busy and making mistakes- everyone is human and the food is good.  But due to their lack of awareness, empathy or basic customer service; and borderline annoyance of being asked about the side order of kimchi (we were told it was in the ramen bowl, but not visible), I (nor the friends I was with) will not be going back to this establishment.",

It was 8pm on a Saturday so needless to say they were busy.  But we were seated right away at the bar so we didn't have a wait.  Our bartender/server was awesome and I'm glad we made the choice to be seated at the bar.  I had the \"hey bartender\" and my drink ended up being a tasty concoction of gin, basil, and lemony goodness.  My husband had the grapefruit soda and that was really refreshing with the right balance of tart and sweet.  We loved our shrimp and chive dumplings so much that we ordered another round of dumplings and tried the pig face dumplings.  Also good!  We split the pork ramen and it was pretty good, as well.  A little salty but I'd prefer the broth be a little savory instead of bland.  Overall the service, food and energy were great.  Can't wait to go back for more.",

    "text": "Peer pressure can be a powerful thing.  Particularly when a peer keeps prodding you to pay of a visit to one of their culinary favorites.  Despite such efforts by her and other peers in the past, I've learned to always temper my expectations and go in with an open mind.  Oh, I do my homework in advance of course, but I've learned that everyone can have a favorite that might not mesh with my palette the same way it does with theirs.  In the case of Clever Koi however, there's more than enough great food and drink (as well as great vibes) to satisfy me and all of my peers.  Clever Koi occupies one of a pair of newly constructed modern commercial spaces along Central Ave just a few blocks north of Indian School.  In one building lies Central Wine Bar and Model Citizen Hair Salon.  In the other lies a beautifully outfitted restaurant with windows galore, a picturesque outdoor patio overlooking Central Ave, and modern furniture throughout.  But if you really wanna see be where the action is, do yourself a favor and sit at the bar like I did.  Besides the bartending staff mixing up drinks and commiserating with the customers, the owners (yes, the actual owners) are cooking up all of the restaurant's signature dishes in an open cooking area right up front complete with a smoker, a grill, and full prep area.  All of it right there to see, smell, and tickle your senses.  I came during happy hour when a number of their drinks and signature dishes are discounted.  I actually tried a couple of their cocktails including the Fish House Punch and the Old Fashioned.  The Punch included rum, cognac, lemon juice and peach schnapps and had what looked like a little spice blend on top and was served in a clear tea cup.  Odd presentation, but a very refreshing drink.  The Old Fashioned was a pretty typical rendition, though I think there was a hint of brandy to go with the bourbon that gave it an extra kick.  The Asian steamed bun dishes aren't discounted for happy hour unfortunately, but past experiences at places like Nobuo and Adobo Dragon have taught me that good Asian steamed bun dishes are not to be missed.  After struggling to pick two I took the bartenders advice and ordered three (I might've been a little buzzed at the time, but I digress).  I went with the duck confit, chicken & waffles, and soft shell crab buns.  The chicken & waffles one is actually a piece of syrup covered chicken inside a waffle with kimchi flavoring, so not a True Asian steamed bun in the purest sense.  It was weird to gaze upon at first, but pretty tasty.  The soft shell crab also has an odd appearance as the entire crab (claws and all) is there in front of you topped with aioli and cucumber, but that crab was delicious and I loved the fish sauce they put on it.  But my favorite byfar of the three was the duck confit.  Ridiculously tender duck and plenty of it complimented by a lightly sweetened plum sauce.  If you're coming here for the steamed buns, by all means be sure to include the duck confit.  For the main event, it was time for a noodle dish since that appears to be Clever Koi's main calling card.  On their Happy Hour menu is arguably the one noodle dish that probably gets more Yelp mentions and more compliments than any other.  The Pork Ramen.  Pork Belly, Kimchi, Hearts of Palm, a hard boiled egg all topping a bevy of noodles.  First and most importantly, the broth for this dish is out of this world.  I could've slurped the broth and been completely happy with this dish.  Seriously, the tender pork, soft noodles, and other cast of characters were a bonus, but the broth is what makes this dish.  To complete the evening (despite being completely full), I shared an order of their banana foster fritters.  Basically cinnamon covered donut holes with banana filling inside and a caramel sauce to dip them in.  Yup, they're as good as they sound.  I only had two since I was already full beyond belief, but it solidified the experience for me at this CenPho gem.  It would be safe to classify Clever Koi as Asian Fusion, but aside from that there's no one description that encapsulates the theme of this place.  From their vast bar selection of drink and mixed drink choices, to their innovative take on Asian steamed buns, to the complex flavor combinations of their noodle bowls, Clever Koi is unconstrained while still being authentic.  And the modern aesthetics make this a great place for a date, a group outing, or just hanging out with friends at the bar.  Total tab for me this night including the two cocktails, 3 steamed buns, ramen bowl, fritters, tax and tip came to about $50.  The prices for the pork ramen and cocktails were discounted quite a bit for happy hour so I would certainly recommend coming here around then.  But as I said earlier, even if its not happy hour, I recommend sitting at the bar.  And let owners Joe, Josh, Jared and Nick make your experience as memorable as it was for me.",

We both had a noodle bowls with different noodles, broths and meats - it's kind of create your own - and we couldn't decide whose was better.

    "text": "This is a cute little place that has not been here too long. But, I am happy they are here. For so long Phoenix downtown has had nothing. So it is great to now have some cool choices around town. First off the Restrooms in here are delightful. There are 2, they are large, and nice and clean. The parking is a little tricky if you don't know the neighborhood. Best parking is around the back. You have to turn down a side street to get to it. Follow the parking for George and Dragon, that makes it easier.  I met a friend here for lunch. While I had parked around the back, she does not know the area that well and ended up parking far away.  But, we came after the lunch crowd, I think it was around 2 so it was not very busy. However ,we did wait a long time for our check and such. Anyway, when I first arrived there was a delightful young man who was so helpful and friendly. I told him I had never been before. So he was kind enough to explain everything to me. About ordering ,where did I want to sit, the food, etc. However, he was through with his shift so we had a different waiter. Still good though. Lunch is a reasonable price. However, I do not recommend if you are in a hurry. Such as your lunch break. It takes a long time to get your food. For lunch all you can get is Noodle bowls. Though you have many noodles types to choose from , as well as different meats or Shrimp. As well as you may add vegetables to it as well as your own type of broth. It was very good, and everything tasted extremely fresh! I am really looking forward to checking them out for dinner.   Very beautiful inside as well. Simple ,yet stunning. I liked it a lot!",

They came all nicely packaged and I went to open them in my hotel room. I had several things wrong on my order. I ended up with a dish I didn't order instead of my potstickers and no utensils, which I paid extra for. I figured out I got the chicken ramen dish and galbi ribs. The ramen was completely soggy, because they didn't separate the noodles and broth, like most ramen places do who take to go orders. The noodles fell apart in a tasteless broth. The meat on the top was dry and hacked to the point I could barely tell it was chicken. I took two bites and couldn't stomach eating anymore. I moved onto the ribs and discovered they were mostly burnt and dried out. If this is what the restaurant has to offer, I would pass on any further meals. As someone who has had ramen in Japan, I recommend trying a different place for ramen.",

Started off with the steamed buns (seriously soooo soft and perfect) ordered the peking duck, pickled pineapple, and lamb pastrami. It would have been nice to have another slice of meat for the lamb pastrami, since it was pretty small for the size of the bun. But all were very delicious! Meal wise I ordered the Chicken Katsu which came with Kimchi, a poached egg, Nori, and Teriyaki. I killed that bowl clean. My girlfriend had the Roasted Pork Ramen with house bacon, pickled mustard greens, a poached egg, bean sprouts, and shiitake. She loved it! My friends ordered the seafood ramen with udon noodles and the only bad thing they had to say was that they wish it was in a bigger bowl with more broth.   The restaurant setting was super chill and all the workers were friendly. However, the only part that limited me from giving 5 stars was the wait time. Especially after we were finished eating it took a while to finally receive our check... but it is still newly opened so i'm sure they'll master that in no time.   definitely will be back for more :)",

The decor was also very nice.    Customer Service  No complainants whatsoever! There was about 10 of us on a service trip and we were hungry and a tad bit drunk yet our server was totally polite and efficient in taking our orders and getting us our food.     Food  It was good. I ordered something pretty basic because I am not the most adventurous person, but my companions ventured out and everyone loved what they got. The ramen is the best, it is certainly NOT what you get at 7-11.  Overall I did not expect to find good Asian cuisine in Arizona but I really liked this place. Everything was an A experience.",

The soft, sensuous steamed bun that gently held a  square of crispy pork belly with just a touch of Hoisin sauce was Out- of -this- World Good ! Ramen is a favorite of mine,  and,   I had to try their version in- spite of the 100+  summer temperature outside. It  was all I could have hoped for: rich ,meaty broth, perfectly cooked soft boiled egg , plenty  of pork belly interspersed with yummy ramen noodles, the ubiquitous Seaweed , and,  for contrast,  a spicy pop of Kim Chee.  The service was excellent. Going back for more tastes soon...not waiting for the temperatures to drop. It's that good ! Try it ! You'll love it!",

Next was onto the \"Pig Face\" braised pork cheek dumplings which, were good but definitely the lowest rank on what we ordered that night.

An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings - Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well.   We had a mix of entrees. Scallop special (only 4 scallops, but well done), Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami (spicy and delectable), Kimchi Fried Rice (a bit salty, but well done), and the Roasted Pork Noodles (very tasty).   I think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there.   N*joy",

    "text": "So I'm trying to be a douche and park at George & Dragon, because I hate all things valet (it's complimentary, you just have to pay for it!) The valet sees me and is all, \"Hey, are you going to Clever Koi? You can't park there.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, you just assumed I'm going to Clever Koi?* Where do you get off, buddy?\"** But yeah, those sneaky buggers will totally corner you into valeting, tail betwixt legs.  *I said literally none of this. **I silently complied.   Moving on, it's happy hour. I order only full-priced drinks because I don't understand money. Fill Collins and Slippin' Jimmy are both exceptional, and I would've drank more if I didn't have to go to another thing to drink more after. The server, noticing our enthusiasm (and dashing good looks) recommended we sit at the bar and get creative with the bartender, which is 100% on for next time.  Edible portion:  - Highlight was also not an HH offering - chicken and waffles, featuring taco'd waffle filled with saucy chicken.   - Blood orange chicken wangs: sounds more creative than it is. Saltier than expected and served with ranch, you get three full bird arms in an artsy little stack. A great option for your friend who wishes you were at Pei Wei and a sports bar. - Yams o'brien: cubes of Japanese sweet potato with sriracha aoli, also much more normal than I had in mind. It's a fun and easy activity to mindlessly eat the whole bowl, but not essential.  - Seasonal vegetable plate with steak: maybe I hate Spring, or vegetables, but the asparagus, beets, and kimchi didn't really do it for me. I liked the yams, but I'd already eaten like, 14 cups of yam by this point. I would pass on this in favor of several more chicken waffles next time.  - Honorable mention: server candy! Man buns, septum piercings, gauges, and tattoos galore. The waiters were 104% more fun to look at than the guests.  5 stars cocktailery & server candy, 3.5 star food. Come for happy hour, stay for the other stuff.",

Id say some of the best cocktails ive ever had.   Food. Also good. Solid. I had the pork ramen - something ive been craving - and it didnt disappoint. Only thing i think could have bee better was the meat cut to be a little less 'tough' i guess. Also had the pork face dumplinga - excellent. And the grilled octopus - also tasty.   Overall id definitely recommend to others and go back.",

On a whim my wife and I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed it!  We came on a Saturday night around 8pm. It was full but since we were just two, we sat at the bar which has full service. The bartender who helped us was very nice and helpful. He made some suggestions for us but wasn't pushy about it. My wife ordered a \"Hey Bartender\" which is a custom drink based on your preferences which the bartender asked her about. It was tasty. I ordered their house grapefruit soda. Also awesome and refreshing!   For appetizers we ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings as well as the pig face dumplings. The shrimp and chive were our favorite of the two but the pig face was definitely unique and tasty as well.   For dinner we ordered the Pork Ramen to split. This is where I could see where my sister thought it was salty. However, I like salty so I'm not a good gauge. My wife really enjoyed it as well and said she'd rather it be slightly salty than bland.   Overall a great experience! We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "This is a great little restaurant.  We are recently huge fans of the Parlor, so thought that finally eating some Chinese food (that's not dim sum) since we moved to Phoenix was called for.  Plus, Central Phoenix is our home.  We tried a variety of things.  Spring roll with beef neck, steamed buns with duck/lamb pastrami, dumplings with pork & kimchi, the mission chinese kung pao and fried rice with bbq pork.  The spring roll was good, glad I tried it, probably wouldn't eat it again (the sauce was weird).  Steamed buns were amazing and delicious and I want more of them.  Dumplings were ok, interesting, spicy, probably wouldn't order again.  Husband loved his kung pao (I want to order it next time) and my fried rice was smokey and full of flavor and veggies and pork (as opposed to the mostly rice version of most chinese take out).  Cocktails.  I would come here just for the drinks.  Oh my goodness they were amazing.  Sloe burn is at the top of the list, first recommendation to anyone.  One of the best cocktails I've ever tried.  Temperance tamer was just what I needed tonight, which was a little sweet and a little sour (grapefruit, yum).  This is a place we will certainly come back to.  We could also see ourselves just coming in for drinks and steamed buns.  That would be delicious.",

Our server was very helpful and led us to fall in love with the duck and roasted beets. I kept it simple with a chicken ramen, which with their house Sriracha was a nice little kick!

I enjoyed the pig face dumplings, octopus and duck buns (don't worry they were individual).   The kim chi and homemade sriracha on the dumplings were delicious.  If you get the ramen make sure to ask your server about the broth, be prepared as it is a \"clever\" take on ramen and one you may not be used to, but still very tasty.  Last but not least don't park in G&D's parking lot, they will tow and that could ruin a good dining experience.  Thank you Clever Koi, we will be back (and probably often).",

    "text": "I went here on a Friday night with a few friends of mine around 6:30. When I first walked in I noticed the modern, cool decor and ambiance with dimmed lighting. There was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't so bad considering the place was pretty small and dinner time on a Friday night. We grabbed a couple Japanese dark stout beers which were awesome while waiting to be seated.  We ordered pork belly steam buns, chicken and waffle steam buns, and Kung pao wings, and scallop dumplings for appetizers. The pork belly steam buns were delicious. The pork was tender and full of flavor while the buns were nice and fluffy. The chicken and waffle steam buns were pretty good but would've been better with a little more sauce. In my opinion the yuzu ponzu that came on the side with the steam buns do not belong with that dish. The scallop dumplings were a little flavorless and the sauce tasted a little bland and just didn't mesh well in my option.  For our entrees we ordered Pad Thai, pork belly ramen, seafood hot pot, and beef and broccolini, and a side of pork belly.  The pad Thai tasted like instant version of noodles, the seafood hot pot could've been better but I think the sour lime flavor over powered any natural seafood flavor and spice that it could've had, the beef and broccolini had a good flavor but a little on the salty side, and at the least I enjoyed the pork belly ramen. The noodles had a Perect chewy texture (not soggy) and the kimchi and pork belly and boiled egg really meshed together well with the miso butter broth. The server had forgotten our Kung pao wings and the side of pork belly so we reminded her twice and they came out at the end. The wings were bland, nothing special about them.  Being an Asian American having tried and knowing what the authentic way these dishes are supposed to taste kind of disappoints my palate. All in all this place serves an Americanized version of Asian fusion cuisine. Ticket times were slow, service was eh, the most of the food was mediocre but the beer, pork steam buns and pork belly ramen were delicious.  I noticed they have happy hour until 6 pm, Maybe I'll come back to try that out, but in my opinion it's not worth spending 130 dollars on.",

Our server dropped two glasses of water at our table and left. When she came she asked us what we wanted to drink. No hi, didn't even introduce herself, didn't ask if we were here before. I sat my menu down and asked what's her name was, I think she got a hint and when she told us that the have team here and everybody will be helping us. Well we do get it , some short introduction would have been nice though, this is not fast food restaurant and for over $100 a dinner for two we do expect a better service. Small talk is needed. Drinks from the bar came out fast and they were great. For appetizers we enjoyed duck fat wings and short rib dumplings, very tasty. Entrees were taking awhile and our server did apologize couple times, we told her not to worry about the wait as we enjoying our night and not rushing anywhere. Entrees came out. We ordered pineapple duck and Thai chili beef. We truly don't care that food took longer than expected , what we do care about is the fact after waiting for so long you gave us cold food. Obviously duck was prepared way before beef , it was cold to touch and it was just warm throughout, rice for beef was cold as well, they put warm meat on top of it.",

    "text": "Thank God for Hipster Restraunteurs! Terrific dining experience. Walked in, immediately impressed with the decor. Open kitchen, so I made sure I sat where I could watch what was happening. They chef cooking the proteins was multi-tasking but you could tell he was on top of the six or seven things he had cooking. Also had a great view of the bar and was stunned. After I got past the fact that I could only identify about a third of the labels on the bottles, I then noticed that there were a whole buch of garnishes and syrups and herbs, all neatly arranged in different bottles and jars, just waiting for the bartender to make something delicious. Since we were there for lunch, we only had the option to make a bowl. I went for Ramen with Pork broth, while Muffin opted for Rice. I added duck, pork belly, egg and mushrooms to mine. She went crazy and got steak, egg, shrimp, bok choy and broccoli. Everything was delicious. You could taste the care that they put into each ingredient. Touch of lemon when finishing the bok choy, check. Homemade sriacha, check. Definitely worth the visit.",

The lunch specials have a great reputation and the create your own concept seems like it would be popular. The dinners however were priced high for rice or ramen noodle specialties and lacked the extra flavor that most folks might be looking for. Great place to share a drink for some urban sophisticated crowds. Be wary of the small parking lot, like many new Central Ave eateries they are banking on light rail users.",

The cook struck up some nice conversation with us and was very friendly. The menu was just the right size - not too daunting with good variety. For appetizers we got the calamari fries and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts themselves are enough to go back. So good!!! For entree, we ordered the wood fire grill plate with flank steak. It was healthy and tasty and fresh - perfect if that is your mood. We also ordered the pork belly and the duck confit steamed buns. The pork belly was my favorite of the two. I look forward to going back and trying the mongolian beef bowl, the spicy seafood hotpot, and the bananas foster fritters. They looked so yummy!!!",

    "text": "Go now! This 5 star review is equally deserving on two fronts: 1) The Restaurant; and 2) The Management. The place is great, but read on to The Management piece as to why the guys running this place are out and out champs.   The Restaurant My wife has been trying to get me here for a couple of weeks now and we finally headed there Friday after work. First impression was the place is really well appointed, but not trying too hard - inviting, hip, but not pretentious. The cocktail menu was a nice surprise. Good wines, beers and sake, but the surprise was the really interesting cocktails. I ordered a bourbon drink with thai chili infused honey. Distinctively bourbon on the front, slight heat on back. Really darn good.   The food, though, was clearly the best part. My wife and I shared several dishes, with the clear winner the pork dumplings on a bed of spicy kimchi and peppers. This thing was probably the best dumpling/pot sticker I ever had. The dumpling was soft with crispy edges and the meat was tender and not too greasy. My wife couldn't stop raving about the great texture. We got an octopus soup and ramen, both outstanding. Lastly, we ordered a duck bun dish, which I've had similar types at other places and all were way too greasy, but this was not at all, just great.   The Management The owners really care about their customers and are doing whatever they can to make the dining experience the best possible. They have the unfortunate circumstance to be located next to the George and Dragon, a Phoenix staple and outright dump, but the problem here is that the management of the pub is so perturbed that another place opened near them, they have taken on the hobby of watching people park in their nearly invisibly posted parking spots (dirt covered paint on pavement) and calling a tow truck, purely out of spite. Little does the G&D management know that being a jerk to The Clever Koi impacts their customers also. Case in point, I parked in what turned out to be one of the pub's spots. Instead of them telling me to simply move my car, they called a tow truck. As my car was being mounted, unbeknownst to me, the owners of The Clever Koi paid off the tow truck driver to protect their customer, in this case, me. Apparently, this happens nearly all the time, with the pub owners having cars towed, purely to be jerks. Little do these guys know that my wife and I were talking about going to have a beer there after dinner. I will NEVER go this this pub again.   I went and talked with the manager of the G&D and told him how childish and stupid his tactics were. He thinks he's hurting his restaurant neighbors, but being a jerk to the customers also hurts them.   You can read my well-deserving 0 star review of them, but the point here is that The Clever Koi is a great place. It's well appointed, not pretentious and the food is interesting and delicious. This place is solid. Go now - just make sure you take advantage of the complimentary valet.",

    "text": "To be honest, I was very skeptical when this place opened because it had very mediocre reviews at first.  We went on a Wednesday night, and it turns out 90% of the menu has changed since it opened. They transitioned to a summer menu and for the most part, it's incredible food.  The steamed buns I would pass on. The Peking duck and the pork belly inside were good, but the bun itself is a bit dry. Also, it's very filling and I wish I had saved my stomach to eat our main course.  We ordered the steak Bibimbap and the seafood hotpot, with the special ($30 for 2 entrees, $5 more to get it with 4 specialty cocktails). The steak in the bibimbap had perfectly crispy edges and tender on the inside. The hotpot is to die for. I don't usually care for thick noodles, but these soak up so much flavor. My boyfriend also does not care for catfish-- except what was in this hot pot. Definitely squeeze some lime into it (comes on the side).  Those cocktails-- amazing. I had the Pimm Jong Il and boyfriend got a tasty canned beer from Nebraska. We also had the drink with sriracha-something in it. You've gotta try it, it's light but with an edge. Also made by a well-dressed man.  What I really admired was the co-owner working the kitchen (we sat at the bar, where there's an open kitchen). He knows so much about the food without being a pretentious jerk. Very friendly and very invested in the food. Wait staff was mostly on point and knew the menu in detail as far as taste/what to expect, so if you're not sure, they can probably give you a good recommendation.  A great place to impress friends, or enjoy a nice dinner on a week day.",

The bar area is very nice and open and I like that you can see the chefs cooking. We started off with the steamed buns. I ordered the Peking duck and my boyfriend got the Tempura onion ring. The Peking duck had house bacon with mizuna and charred plum jam. It was tasty and I think the steam buns complimented the duck but it was a little messy to eat. The tempura onion ring was ok. Just tasted like onion rings wrapped in a bun with pineapple flavoring. Then we got a Seafood Hot Pot and Massaman Udon. The bowls were a bit on the small side.. I could have paid $6 less and got a big bowl of pho. But anyways the Seafood Hot pot was good but not great. I liked the shrimp and scallop and the octopus fish cake. The only thing I would have liked was more broth . They filled the soup broth only 1/3 of the bowl. My boyfriends dish the Massaman Udons were delicious!! It had red curry with roasted duck, fingerling and pickled peppers. It tasted just like a Thai dish but instead of rice they served it with noodles. I wanted to eat his food instead of mine lol.  Overall I would come back for the steamed buns. The staff was friendly but the service was slow. It wasn't that busy but it took forever to get our food and check.",

A rotating menu and bar program may stink at times because you might loose your favorite item but is an opportunity to find a new favorite.   We have been going for several years and always come back. I insist on trying new places and using Clever Koi as my bench mark and nothing beats this place.

I say this as for the third time in a row, we had to wait ( two of us) at least 10 minutes after being seated to have anyone even recognize or talk to us. This was after being looked at by many employees without even a verbal acknowledgement or hello. Very poor customer service.   After waiting for the apparent requisite 10 to 15 minutes even to get water, we had to wait an average of  another 20 to 25 minutes for drinks, then apps then dinner. 90 minutes from being seated to eating is absolutely unacceptable. Then to top it off, after self-parking in the lot, and being in the restaurant for over 90 minutes and dropping well over 100 bucks, the valet attendant intentionally parked a vehicle directly behind mine in the middle of the parking lot and blocked me in. It took him 10 minutes, after I asked him to move the car blocking mine, to move the car out of my way. He then had the balls to tell me to never park in \"his lot again!\" That absolutely sent me to the moon. I will NEVER go back to the Clever Koi as I have never been treated so poorly in my life at a business. I will certainly never recommend anyone to go there. Absolutely shameful.",

The inside of the restaurant is very modern, a bit tight, so the tables are somewhat close together, but it really is well done. The patio looked nice as well, but we opted to sit inside due to the heat and the fact I was carrying a fully \"cooked\" baby.  Anyway, on to the food... everything was delicious and unique. I don't think I've ever had food quite like the Clever Koi. The Hubs and I shared a noodle bowl and some small plates. As I recall, the noodle bowl was very spicy, so that was slightly tough for me, but the Hubs thought it was amazing. The small plates we had were so good, pig face dumplings were top notch.   Can't wait to get back to the Clever Koi at some point, hopefully soon. This is a \"hot spot\" and the food surely backs up the hype.",

It is so nice to have people coming by and genuinely saying it was good to see me, and If I needed anything else. I felt as if I had the entire staff looking out for me.

Billed as a fusion, we ordered pad thai and a duck curry.  The pad thai was swimming (drowning?) in a very thai peanut sauce, which i like but it was neither a fusion dish (e.g. with Korean influence) nor what i expected -- a drier noodle based pad thai.  The duck curry was more traditional coconut curry and the duck meat was tasty.   However, the kitchen's choice of udon noodles in the curry in lieu of rice was a poor one, turning it into a soup.  I must commend the restaurant for its excellent home made sriracha sauces and an out of this world beignet dessert.  If i am in Phoenix again I might go back and give it another try.  But...",

I recommend adding the red chili sauce they provide on the table. Just remember a little goes a long way!   One dish I don't recommend is the Kimchi Fried Rice. I was very underwhelmed and ended up eating off of everyone else's dish except mine! Ha!   Drinks are spectacular! I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the mixologists make the drinks. They put so much thought and effort into each drink. It really is like an art! Riding the Pine St. was my favorite drink so far.

However our server was so busy, we had to flag her twice before she could come to our table to take our orders.   Our appetizers were the soft shell crab in steamed bun and the fried chicken with waffle. They were served with a side of soy sauce vinaigrette. I found their flavor profiles interesting, but only fair to my taste. My wife, however, liked both, especially the soft shell crab.   The pineapple fried duck leg, roasted vegetables & rice cake. The duck had crispy skin & nice flavor, but the meat was dry. The pineapple sauce was so light that I could not taste its fruitiness (my wife did though).   The lemon chicken ramen that my wife ordered had a nice, yet light, broth. The chicken pieces were crispy & tasty. The noodles were al dente. But the pickled daikon did not go well with the rest of soup, in my opinion. Again, my wife liked this bowl of ramen.   Perhaps my taste buds were off tonight. I found the cuisine here fair, but not outstanding. My wife liked this restaurant though.   The banana fritters, served with a caramel sauce on the side, were good. And so was the vanilla ice cream.   Our server was attentive. She refilled our glasses several times during our time there. She did not mind repeating the dessert menu at our request.   Because this restaurant is at least 26 miles away from our home and my neutral experience with its dishes, I am uncertain I will make the effort to return to it.",

    "text": "Was in the area on business and saw some good yelp reviews. I have a hard time finding decent Asian  restaurants in town, so I headed on over. It's kind of hard to find, stuck in the middle of a tight sort of modern strip mall type structure, but there is plenty of parking in the back. I circled twice...I wasn't giving up  easy!  Glad I did.   The menu was very different, you picked what protein, what vegetable, etc. All a la carte. Really nice actually, and good options. I picked lemon chicken, carrots, mushrooms and snow peas. Added pickled ginger on the side. I had it with brown fried rice-which I told waiter I was concerned about being too tough-as it often is. He said they used small pearl rice, and it was no problem-so I went with it. Glad I did!  When it came, piping hot, I was so anxious from the aromas emanating I mixed the lovely plate all up before I thought to take a pic-so the presentation is great-I messed it up!  The chicken came cut in long, thin, perfectly cooked tender slices. There was no obvious sauce, but lord the taste was fantastic! I devoured this in record time.  Wait staff was very nice and professional. A very comfortable yet trendy atmosphere. I told her I would for SURE be back, bringing a friend to try it too-even though I'm a 40 minute drive away.  THAT'S how yummy it was.   I took a pic of the interior too, it's small, not super fancy but very hip. I liked it-overall-  very much.",

    "text": "The Clever Koi delivered on so many levels! We came in for lunch and based on a recommendation and the reviews we were hoping for a good bowl of ramen...we got our good ramen and a lot more!  Lunch has a build your own bowl concept that allows you to choose between noodles, stir fry, chilled noodles and rice. If you choose stir fry or chilled noodles you are ready to move on to your next step. If you select the rice option you need to decide if you want Fried or Steamed Rice, and also select between White and Brown. If however you choose the noodles section, you open yourself up to a few more options starting with noodle: Udon / Ramen / Gluten Free and continuing with the broth: Pork / Dashi (Veg) / Chicken. Once these decisions have been made you are ready to select your protein: Pork Belly / Lemongrass Chicken / Duck / Steak / Shrimp / Tofu. There is also a section for Veggies: Carrots / Mushrooms / Bean Sprouts / Bok Choy / Snow Peas / Broccoli / Bamboo Shoots. Finally there are a few extras you can add: Egg / Kimchi Pickled Ginger. The Bowls start at $5, Proteins are $3, Veg is $1 and Extras are $.50. We ordered two Noodle Bowels, one with Udon Noodle, Pork Broth, Pork Belly, Broccoli, Mushrooms, and an Egg. The broth was lovely--creamy and mouth coating, full of flavor, but still rather lite for a ramen pork broth. Noodle were good, as was the pork belly. Veggies were spot on and the egg was perfectly cooked--soft with a slightly runny center.  While we were still planning the options for are aforementioned bowls the server came by to explain the menu. First world famished as we were, we took the opportunity to order the Crispy Pig Face Dumplings with House Siriracha, Kimchi, and Scallions and the Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets with Miso Cashew Puree, and Daikon Sprouts from the Small Bites section of the menu. The Small Bites came out soon after we placed our order for the bowls, and were wonderful! We loved the house made sriracha!...the dumpling were full of flavors and depth with a nice contrast from the kimchi and scallions. The Goat Cheese & Roasted Beets were good, but they came with an exceptional (probably crack laced) miso cashew puree. The puree had the consistency of hummus and was so amazing that we would have taken jars of it home with us if was for sale.  I wasn't really planning on drinking, but it was readily evident that was a strong cocktail and drink program at the Clever Koi, so I took the occasion to order their Sloe Burn, made of Old Charter 8Yr / Plymouth Sloe Gin / Basil / Thai Bird Honey / Lemon. The menu describes it as spicy, with hints of cherry, anise + oak. I was thoroughly impressed with the balance of acid, sweet, heat, and alcohol. It made a great accompaniment to our enjoyable meal.  I think we came in right after they opened. We experienced a quiet lunch in a beautiful space. I can imagine Clever Koi becoming quite loud for dinner or evening drinks however. I don't think I'd enjoy that nearly as much, but as long as the kitchen can keep up, I would anticipate the food and drinks to be great.",

We went around 6:30pm on a Friday and sat at the bar as we were told there was about a 20 min. wait for the table. Although, I have to say there were multiple tables available and I don't believe they were for reservations as they were empty the whole time we were there. Anyway... we ordered the duck steamed buns, sweet potato dumplings, duck chow mein, and their special of the night which was yellowtail over rice with black kale and persimmons. The duck steamed buns were really good, but pricey. The sweet potato dumplings reminded me of empanadas as the shell was fried, like a taco kind of way, not a fried dumpling kind of way. However, I really enjoyed them. However, I was very disappointed in my entree. It was super salty. The fish was salty, the kale was salty, even the rice was salty. I tried a bite of the duck chow mein and it was ok, not a huge fan of chow mein anyway so I'm no judge there. For all that, the bill came to about $60. Super disappointed but at least that's another restaurant I can check off of my list. But if you're looking for an asian fusion place, I'd check out SumoMaya, also a little pricey but at least the food's really good!",

It is THEE BEST bowl of anything in the valley.  The flavors and textures are amazing.  I don't know what my favorite component of this dish is...sometimes it's the egg, other times it's the kimchi and while I'm not a huge pork eater, the pork belly is so good!

The ramen was tasty and the broth was unique (although the pork shoulder requires a bit of work) and my gf liked her kimchi fried rice. The cocktails were stellar, particularly for folks like me who enjoy actually tasting the spirits.  Needs a bit of work: Service is still a bit rough (if eager), and they should refine some of the dishes.  Overall, I plan on becoming a regular here, and with a little bit more finesse and experience this becomes a five star spot.",

    "text": "This review is being wrote after the second time eating at the restaurant. Before I even walked in the restaurant, I loved the little \"plaza\" that The Clever Koi was in. It is an old existing building that contains two more businesses: Pour, a wine bar lounge and a hair salon. They all work well together.  The businesses all have floor to ceiling windows that face towards the center walk so it is easy to see people that may be joining your party and to create a more open urban feeling. Each time I go, it has been busy so you might want to call ahead and find out if there is a wait. One of my favorite items is the wings. They taste different than \"ordinary\" wings and it is not so many that you get full before your meal. A good one to share with one or two others. All the food at the table was fresh, flavorful and good portion size. One of my favorite dishes was a noodle dish called Spicy Seafood Hot Pot. It had a nice seafood flavor with a kick. The Clever Koi is classified as Asian-American comfort food and I think you will find it just that.",

The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian \"inspired\" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was \"good\"  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet.",

I mean for the price, I want a big platter of dumplings and a whole jar of kim chee- not the three or four dumplings that we got!  Same thing with the ramen. I was like, how much for the bowl of noodles??? Okay, okay, I am sure I've been spoiled by Japan town in LA or actual ramens in Japan.  Admittedly, I did enjoy the atmosphere and decor.

I got the pork broth with tofu (weird I know, I just like it), mushrooms (which were shiitakes, not just button mushrooms), a soft boiled egg, bean sprouts and kim chi. Holy moly! My friend did nearly they identical thing, only she got pork belly and some bamboo too. We didn't talk for a while. The egg was perfect. But my fav was the kim chi. I needed some to munch on as I was eating my ramen. The owner/manager/someone important came over and brought me extra kim chi to take home on top of my side! Like \"we don't see people that love kim chi as much as you; please have some more!\" Tomorrow, kim chi friend rice. I'm going back, for sure! Great service, great food.

BUT let me tell you that they are living proof that someone cares about their customers. Uber Eats gave me a very angry driver who called and very curtly exclaims \"where are you?!\" As his greeting. When he hands me my food, it's only one bag and we had a fairly considerable order, so I let the driver know food was missing after I checked the bag. He gets irritated with me and then tells me I need to call the restaurant. I realized the uber eats guys was just angry at the world so I called the restaurant. They immediately got me to a manager because they had seen the driver had left the rest of the order there. While I'm talking to the manager the uber driver is yelling at me to update my uber request. I explain to the Manager who I learn is one of the owners what is going on with the driver. The owner asked where I lived and drove the rest of the order to my house. You want to support this business - high quality food and service!!",

My girlfriend, baby, and myself decided to try this out after  looking for a nice ramen place. Based on the excellent reviews, why not? So we decided for a lunch visit.  You do have to park around back, the only thing bad about this place. But it is just a minor inconvenience.   I was greeted by 1 of the four owners, Nick C., and was directed to a table. We were seated and Nick promptly gave us water and ordered drinks. I ordered a hot tea (which I cannot remember what is was called, but it was fantastic), and girlfriend ordered a coke.  My menu for the lunch order was a \"build your own bowl\". I decided on a Ramen Noodle bowl, with pork broth. I chose the pork belly as the protein with carrots/mushrooms/bok choy as the vegetables. The extras I added were the eggs and kimchi. Too good. Mouth watering, like heaven having a party in my mouth. I honestly cannot wait until I come here again.   The girlfriend ordered a pork chow mein which wasn't too bad. She preferred my ramen over her chow mein, but hers was still tasty.   Due to this being a trendy, hip place I did see a lot of different drinks and such which I hope to experience one day.",

The ambience is great and more dressy than casual which is exactly what I was looking for. The alcohol that adorned the wall behind that bar was vast as well. We were greeted immediately upon entering and were seating promptly. My sister and I took advantage of the \"2\" deal which was two meals and four cocktails for $30.  Beyond a great deal IMO. We had two cocktails each and appetizers to start.  I had the curry and my sister had the salmon bibimbap.  Everything was beyond delicious. My food actually had spice to it too which I appreciate as I fancy spicy foods.  We were also given complimentary peach fritters for my birthday for dessert which were phenomenal.

While parking is not the best (most spaces are \"reserved\" for George and Dragon patrons only), we always have managed to find a spot fairly easily. If not, they always have valet available.   Ambiance is fantastic. Love how it's decorated, the interior design and lighting are great.  Service? Some of the best I've ever experienced. David has been our server both times and I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He's so friendly, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about not only the food menu, but the drinks as well. He can explain every single ingredient of the drink menu to you, from chartreuse to Pimm's to anything else you may not know. If I've had a sweeter, more genuine server, I cannot remember when it was. He remembered us from our first foray in and made sure to say goodnight to us as we left (and let us know the new menu would be coming out soon, yes!). The general manager (who has been there both times we have) is always super friendly as well, running food and always making sure everyone's happy. The bussers are great too (waters were always kept full) and the place runs like a well oiled machine.  Drinks were awesome. My husband ordered one that ended up being fairly strong, so David came by and did a few revisions to it, making it absolutely delicious. I had the Temperance Trap (awesome), one of my girlfriends had the Paloma (also awesome), and another friend had the homemade Green Apple soda (a special for the night), which he loved.  Okay, so now onto the food.  Ohhhh, the food.  Blue Lake Green Beans. Every person at the table said the same thing (both times): \"how can you make green beans taste THIS good?\" Answer from David: the woodfire grill, of course. Apparently in the winter there are brussel sprouts instead of green beans, so I can't wait for it to get chilly again!  Things I didn't eat but was told were amazing: the chicken and waffles and  pork belly steamed buns, pork ramen, chicken ramen, and chicken chow mein. All six of us last night were \"mmmm\"ing through the meal.   Both times, I've ordered the vegetable chow mein with tofu. So. So. So good. The tofu is cooked on the woodfire grill, the vegetables (especially the mushrooms) are marinated in some blend of spices that are so delicious that one of my fellow diners had to try some out of another's bowl.   For dessert... well, we went a bit dessert crazy. David let us know there were a few new desserts: a chocolate pudding with a cashew nougat and a citrus soft serve, in addition to the bananas foster fritters. It was my husband's birthday so we thought \"what the hell\" and ordered all three. And I am so glad we did, because they were all delicious.   Throughout the meal David came by to ask us how everything was, to chit chat with us and make sure we knew he was available. We absolutely loved talking with him and appreciated so much that we knew he wasn't too busy for us (even though he was definitely busy!).   I can't say enough good things about Clever Koi. Now I can't wait for the new menu to come out, so we have another excuse to go visit!",

The food is delicious, they have a wooden grill inside that you can observe them cooking on. The specials of the day are so great, but they go fast!   There are so many different routes to go down to experience the flavors of their menus, so I recommend going with some friends so you can try a little bit of everything!",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to hit up Clever Koi on a random weekday night in an attempt to actually explore our surroundings. We had a bit of trouble finding it since it is tucked away from the road, but we finally found the right parking area after we looped around once. We had made reservations since we were worried about a possible crowd and a table was ready for us when we got in. We were seated quickly and definitely had a moment of \"oh god what should I order because everything sounds good.\" The menu had gyoza, buns, noodles, ramen, etc.  My friend was super interested in the rabbit gyoza while I was drawn to the black bean and celery root cakes. My friend enjoyed the gyoza and we both liked the black bean and celery root cakes but agreed that they would have been better with either less wasabi, or perhaps wasabi on the side rather than directly on top. For our main dishes, we grabbed the pork ramen and the pad thai with tofu. My friend loved the pork ramen and I thought the pad thai was good, though a bit on the sweeter side than I like. I also felt that $3.00 was a bit of an excessive charge for adding tofu to the pad thai, particularly because it literally came with 3 large pieces of tofu only. Though I was a bit irked by the tofu portion, the pad thai portion was ginormous. I could not finish it in one sitting and definitely had to take some to go. One thing I really loved about this place was that they had their own little hot sauces that you can use to spice up your food. I'm a spicy/flavorful food junkie so this was right up my sleeve.   Clever Koi lived up to my expectations overall. It had great service, good food, a very chill atmosphere, and an interesting interior + patio seating. I am definitely going back to try their other menu items such as chow mein and vegetarian ramen! *I may also be super curious about their interesting list of cocktails.*",

Oh course, several popped up, but Clever Koi had what we were looking for in a meal. Service was excellent (shout out to RaeAnne) as she gave us a nice rundown of drinks and her favorite dishes. Being somewhat ADHD myself, squirrel, I did not pay attention to all of the suggestions. My wife however did. My wife ordered the XO Noodles and I could not believe all of the flavors that hit you from that dish - one of the best dishes I have tasted!!! Sous Chef Luis, incredible job! This place is a must when visiting Phoenix. Loved it so much, I would even brave the heat of summer to eat here again!!!",

Soggy breading and flavorless meat.  Basically inedible.  The waitress noticed we only ate 3 of the 6 per order and yet didn't offer to change the order.  The black bean \"pancakes\" were kinda like veggie burgers, much thicker than expected.  Though they were tasty, I would probably never order them again.  The 2nd extra star is for the delicious soft shell crab bun which came with a jicama slaw dressing.  The chicken and waffle \"bun\" might have been a good idea conceptually but didn't come thru in execution.  Not enough syrup and crispy chicken was over cooked.   I wouldn't come back here again.",

The noodles in the ramen mixed with the crunchiness of the vegetables and the sweetness of the lemon in the chicken is to die for.   Today, I decided to switch it up and go with the kimchi fried rice with the lemongrass chicken and it was just okay. The egg and chicken were done really well but there was a lot of spices and seasoning and it would have paired well with a sauce of some kind to offset how dry the seasoning made it. Overall, 7/10.   I will always return and I will never stray from lemon pepper chicken ramen again. Stay clever, friends.",

I mean seriously, if you're reading this and dig a little gin, get the Uptown.   We were seated swiftly and had such a first-rate dinner, both of our servers were amazing, accommodating, and so kind (seriously, give them a raise they were the best). Shout out to Zach + Nick for being great sports when we forced them outside to help us take a group photo!

So today I went there thinking I would treat myself to a working lunch and enjoy a glass or two of wine and some chow mein.  The young man behind the bar was clearly not there to help service the paying customers and clearly has no business working in ANY public service establishment since he clearly is unaware that the patrons that enter your establishment are the ones that pay his bills.  I sat down at the bar as I usually do and was approached by the young man who seemed less than enthused to be there, I ordered a glass of wine which he promptly brought to me and then he walked away.  Now having been a restaurant owner myself I am usually fairly patient with issues that can arise, misunderstandings of a certain nature, young people who are just lacking experience.....I get it!  However, as you will be able to see form the camera footage in your establishment I sat and waited for over 20 minutes with only two other patrons inside the restaurant before I finally had had enough of being flat out ignored and I walked out and intend to never return.  Meanwhile this young bartender/waiter, whatever he was never ONCE spoke another word other than taking my beverage order to me, and in fact walked up to where I was sitting three times in nearly half hour that I was there an never asked if I wanted anything to eat, never mind that I had looked at the menu at least half a dozen times waiting to have my order taken.  I would suggest Mr. Campisano that you do a better job of assessing your talent and in fact find people who actually possess the talent of working in the service industry and who want to be there.  As well some proper coaching of the responsibilities of the job with your team is MUCH needed as this specific individual spent more time off the floor and running back and forth from \"Across the Pond\" rather than tending to the patrons that were sitting at his bar.  Shameful and completely lacking any concept off customer awareness and appreciation for those that CHOOSE to spend there money there.  LEARN THE BASICS....THE CUSTOMER PAYS THE BILLS!!!",

I think this is more a place for the adventurous diners. If you're expecting authentic Asian food, this is not it. If you want a flavorful, unique dish that pulls from different cultures, look no further! The staff are friendly & chill, & usually quite attractive! They tend to be consistently busy & don't have a ton of space so I highly recommend making a reservation, even for dinner during the week it's helpful.",

Cool building as you approach with a super cool patio, inside is super chill and well decorated with neat light fixtures, clean bathrooms which is a must. On to the food. Andrew was very helpful in our decisions being that everything sounded great. Pad Thai, best ever, house salad best ever, Brussel sprouts best ever, fried black rice with shrimp was awesome! Start with the Tuna rice chips. WOW! No room for deserts, can't wait to go and try the mixologist cocktails. Can't wait to back period. Pictured is Kimchi fried rice we got to go knowing that we'd be craving to try one more thing next day. Can't say enough good things about this place. Goooo!!!",

A table wasn't available so we took 2 chairs at the Kitchen bar. It actually turned out to be a cool spot to sit. We got to watch the staff prepare dishes. Impressed how they worked as a team and were very efficient. Plus we could scope out what they had to offer for food.   We started with the chicken & waffle and soft shell crab buns. The chicken and waffle was ok, nothing special IMO. But the soft shell crab bun was amazing!! I checked in on the Yelp app and got a free bun of my choice. I obviously got another soft shell crab bun haha. I had 2 beers (Dragoon IPA and some type of red ale), both were on tap and were pretty good.  Our main dishes were the Lemon Grass Chicken Ramen with added Duck and soft egg. The ramen noodles had a little chew to them and were excellent. Broth, chicken, duck, egg and veggies were all very good, 5/5. My wife ordered the Pad Thai with Duck. Could have used a little more sauce but it was still pretty good 4/5.   Overall a great atmosphere, friendly staff, great food but very noisy. When we're back in Phoenix we'll definitely hit up Clever Koi again.",

    "text": "Just meh. Overall underwhelmed and disappointed by this place. I think this is the first time I have attended a 4.5 star yelp joint with almost 1,000 reviews, to not give it at least a 4 myself. Bummer.   The atmosphere in here was very aesthetically pleasing. Great for pics and 'grams of food, if that's your thing. However, the food and the service were really lacking. I went with a group of 5. We got the dumplings, pad Thai, pork ramen, and shaking beef. The best thing we ordered was the dumplings.   Pad Thai- this dish had the perfect amount of spice, but didn't have any special components or wow factor. Definitely not worth the price, especially once you add a protein.  Pork ramen- also kind of flavorless. The pork belly was pretty tough...... I understand it was meant to be crunchy, however I expected a soft inside like typical pork belly. It was just a hard block.  Shaking beef- too much rice, flavor also meh. The beef was pretty hard and charred. It also came out cold which I don't know if it was supposed to but wasn't a fan of.   Cocktails were expensive and took about ten years to arrive to our table. I would consider them good, not great, and I don't think the price was justified for what you actually got.   The servers were really nice but everything took sooooooo longggggggggg. We didn't even get our first drinks until after our appetizer arrived. We ordered a second drink shortly after our food arrived, only to receive it right when the bill was coming to the table and we no longer had food. They did comp this drink though- which was much appreciated. The wait for the appetizer itself was longer than normal, and time between different plates arriving wasn't timed well.   Overall not impressed and won't be back, unless invited for a work dinner or something. There are way better places in Phoenix to dine - and a bomb a** Thai joint (Glai Baan) where your money will be better spent.",

To be fair I've had excellent customer service in the past but was actually embarrassed about the poor customer service.   I wanted to try dishes I've never tried before but uncertain of the size or appetite, I asked to hold onto a menu. My girl friend ordered her main dish after a small appetizer and I ordered mushroom dumplings. My girlfriend got her dish, I didn't want hers to get cold, so I told her to start. I couldn't get our waiters attention for the life of me. The order was never placed. It took almost an hour to get and in the meantime, my friends plate and been cleared and I was still waiting. Another server stopped by and wanted to take menu. I explained that I hadn't receive dumplings and I would like to hold onto a menu. He checked on order and said it would be up any moment now, then replaced menu on table and told me not to use it as a placemat but I was just seeing what else I would want that wouldn't take long. After getting the dumplings an hr after ordering I was done. Still not trying to make a big deal we ordered desert (ice cream) figuring it wouldn't take long but that wasn't the case. Staff was negligent and rude. I get that they were busy but the entire experience was sad.",

When he returned with the next batch they were prepared the same way and cold. I suggested that they might consider keeping the kimchi on one side of the plate and the warm dumplings on the other.

Last time we went, we sat in the kitchen bar where we got to see all of the food being prepared. It was like dinner and a show. Well people kept ordering the cauliflower dip. This is something I probably would have never thought to order but watching them make it made me want to try it so we did tonight. It was so tasty. It was a bit spicy but the sweet onions on top balanced it out perfectly. We tried the short rib dumplings. They were amazing. The broth they are in is so good. I loved the pork ramen last time so I had to have it again. Delicious. My husband had the Arizona Ramen. That was slightly spicy but full of flavor.",

    "text": "Went here today for late lunch. Happily they were open, unlike some other places around here (cough Nishikawa.)   I started with the pork cheek dumplings. The dumplings were stellar. They were crispy on the bottom and soft and juicy on the top, perfect. I meant to ask if they made the Kimchi in house, but on reflection I'm sure they do. I love Kimchi and learned to make it Japan and Korea. Now maybe I'm just a traditionalist, but I think their Kimchi could have used more garlic, definitely more Gochugaru, and time. Time allows the fermentation process to give an effervescence to the Kimchi, and this one barely had that quality. The little sweet red peppers don't belong in Kimchi or this dish. I would replace them with a few salty edamame to help season the dish.   As I had been denied Ramen just minutes before, (cough Nishikawa) I next had the pork ramen. First, it was gigantic. I'm a pretty big eater but I only got through half of it. The crispy pork belly was spectacular. I will definitely be back to try the steamed buns with pork belly. I love nori so that was a nice addition, and the egg was perfectly cooked. I didn't notice any cilantro in the dish even though it's listed on the menu, but I wasn't bothered by that. After thinking about that for a moment though maybe the absence of cilantro made the Carnitas not make sense. I thought that it didn't need to be there and it was somewhat out of place in this dish.  But, the heart and soul of a good ramen is the broth. This broth was good, and I would happily drink a hot cup of it for breakfast. But still, it was only good and didn't rise above that. For the chefs, if you want to experience something you can measure your broth against head to Pasadena to a place called Tatsunoya. It's worth the drive, it's even worth the walk. When you get there there's going to be a line around the building and you'll have to wait about an hour for a table, but it's worth it.   I will definitely be back as there are many items on the menu I want to try. Thank you for a great lunch.   I also ordered XO noodles to go because I wanted to try something that was prepared in that fantastically flaming hot wok. Those will have to wait until tomorrow because I'm still full from my late lunch.",

The menu was interesting but no matter what I tried the food seemed to fall short in terms of taste. I stopped coming here for a long time.   Recently our friend suggested that a group of us go. I saw the ratings had gone up so I thought I would try it again. The food did taste a lot better. Between the three of us we had the ramen, brussel sprouts, dan dan noodles, various baos, and pineapple duck.   Unfortunately shortly after leaving we all go sick to varying extents. Two of us threw up and I had a bad stomach ache all night. We are all accustomed to asian food and eclectic menus so I strongly believe there was something contaminated in the food. For that alone I would have to give 1 star. Highly disappointed, I can't seem to get it right with this place.",

I didn't have any of their happy hour stuff but the deals were great and their cocktails sounded amazing. The atmostphere out on the patio is really peaceful and feels quite nice even when it's pretty hot out, given all the shade from their beautiful plants.

However, they have an awesome happy hour menu and the cocktails are some of the best in the valley. Overall a really cool spot to get some happy hour grub.

My favorite appetizer has been the duck fat sriracha wings which are absolutely phenomenal! We have also enjoyed the galbi short ribs and the black bean pancakes (so good!). As for the entrees, I really enjoy the spicy seafood hot pot, which has an awesome mix of seafood including calamari and scallops. I have also gotten all of the different Steamed buns, and if I had to pick a favorite it would definitely be the soft shelled crab steamed bun.   They also have some good signature cocktails and my fiancee enjoys a gin based cocktail that I'm struggling to recall the name of. I am happy with the beer offerings that they have.   We never leave Clever Koi disappointed and have even ordered it through a couple of the food delivery services. Writing this review is making me hungry for some duck fat wings!",

We went around 7p on a Friday night, and though it was very crowded, we were seated right away. I loved that it felt private and not too loud, but was also full of people. It was a really fun atmosphere. It was also cool to be able to see the chefs working in the kitchen, I always think that's fun. Our servers were awesome as well; our plates were always cleared super fast, and we never had a chance to finish our water before they brought more!  For an appetizer, we ordered the Confit Wings (#1). These were delicious! You could taste the duck fat, which I haven't had before, but I thought it was really good, and I loved the siracha sauce. For dinner my fiance ordered the Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, which he really liked, but thought was hard to eat lol. Neither of us know what we're doing with chopsticks. I got the House Pad Thai with tofu, and that was really good as well!   If I'm being honest, while we thought the food was really good, we didn't love it, but that's just because we haven't had a ton of authentic Asian food (even though they say they're Asian-inspired I felt like it was really authentic), so maybe it's just not our thing!   Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fun dinner! It's on the expensive side I think, but I loooved the restaurant itself, and do want to go back to try more of the menu options. I need to try the cocktails, too!  :)",

Food is very worth the hundreds of positive reviews. Lunch specials are great!  What really made the experience top notch is the attentiveness of the people who own/work here.  I ordered the ramen with pork belly, which was delicious! I don't know what sorcery they use but the pork belly was crispy and succulent.   But I am trying to watch what I eat, so instead of devouring the pork belly (like I would have normally done), I took it apart and only ate the leaner portions. When one of the guys noticed the scraps, he asked if I wanted more leaner pieces. Now. That's what I call great service and attention to their patrons needs.   Check it out! I can't wait till my next visit!",

I ordered a Riesling which was delicious. For entree I had the \"lemon pepper chick ramen\". So great! I tried to finish it. I wanted to drink the broth, it was so good. The chicken was crispy.

    "text": "What a super funky place. Fusion food is tough to do right and Clever Koi knows what they're doing! Everything we had on the shared plates menu was stellar, easy to share, and perfectly portioned for our group of 4 ladies. The fried chicken and maple syrup buns were a favorite, as well as the ramen and other noodle dishes. Between the four of us we shared about 5 plates and ended up leaving some food behind as we were too stuffed to go on.  Cocktails were also fabulous! I was so glad to see sipping vinegars (aka shrubs) on the menu. Opting out of cocktails for one round, I just asked if I could have a shrub and soda. One of the absolute best shrubs I've ever had was their cucumber shrub. Wowza! A little of it topped off with soda water and a cucumber slice and I was in heaven. I could drink this every single day for the rest of my life! It was sweet, refreshing, and had just a kick of that sour vinegar flavor that's oh so yummy. A follow up drink was a ginger shrub and soda and it was lovely as well. Definitely something everyone visiting this restaurant should try.  So with great food, great drinks, and great company - our trip was just what I needed after a long flight to Phoenix. Topping off the experience there was fantastic service and an incredible hip, sexy, welcoming atmosphere.   The restaurant has a bit of a fishbowl feel as the walls are all windows, but it makes for an extremely trendy, extremely beautiful evening. Great spot for ladies night, date night, or to impress coworkers. This was so unexpected for me and not what I envisioned as a place that would exist in Phoenix. This city is so cool and I'm so glad to have been able to visit and come to a spot like this to make my trip perfect.",

They usually have some upbeat music playing loudly to help drown out the sounds of the open kitchen.The bar is decently priced for the area, however, this is a very expensive lunch venue now. I do not recommend it for lunch time. That aside they have a great ramen broth and excellent pork buns. They recently got rid of their lunch \"Build Your Own\" option and so now the same order costs $6-11 more than it used to making a lunch cost about $20-25 on average. The rest of their menu is interesting and their take of Asian fare is usually good but lacks a certain zest. The menu items are quite varied with a decent flavor, but nothing really unique you can't find elsewhere. They have a posted menu on Google, but all the prices are half of what they actually charge so be careful in your planning.",

Atmosphere:   This is a perfect date night spot or night out with friends. It's intimate and charming inside with low lighting and a warmth coming from the kitchen. You can either choose to sit inside or outside and if you sit inside, you can watch them hustle and bustle behind the counter.   Food/Drink   I didn't have a cocktail there the night I went, but I was impressed with the extension cocktail list and will definitely be back to give it a try. The food theme here is a lot about sharing which is what we did.   We started with a couple appetizers, and the one that stood out the most were the Edamame Fritters which were delicious! Imagine Edamame fried into a ball with a sweet sauce to dip. For our main meal, we decided to try several different dishes including the Massaman Curry, Chow Mein, Fried Rice and a couple other items. My favorite item by far was the Curry and when I come back, I will just order that and possibly ask for extra chicken. It had the perfect flavor to it and was creamy and delicious!   I really like this restaurant and especially the atmosphere and warmth. It's a nice addition to the growing Downtown area and I hope they put more businesses like this in the area.",

Every time I have been one of these three things has happened, which is a shame! As a server for many years, service really does make or break a place for me. Unfortunately last night I went straight to the Clever Koi after my workout so I was super hungry. Right when I was thinking our food hadn't been rung in, the bartender walked over and asked me what my order had been and I watched him ring it in. This was almost an hour after ordering! I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was busy but - damn! Luckily I had good company with my friend and all was well, I just wish he had owned the mistake. I'll definitely be back for the amazing food but I'll also wait awhile until the memory of the friendly but slow service fades.",

The dish itself needed more aesthetic appeal yet the bite was scrumptious and the mix veggies with the mango sauce was fabulous.  Skip the green tea pound cake, not too much bragging on that dessert.",

    "text": "This is an excellent \"Neo-Asian\" restaurant which has a very eclectic menu, full of food combinations anyone would love, if you like Asian or Fusion cuisine. My friend and I had the pork belly buns, Kobe beef with mushrooms, and Vietamese catfish for appetizers. The Kobe beef is just simply delicious and literally melts in your mouth. The catfish is just fantastic with the sauce and the toasted cracker. Then I had the pork Ramen as well as the seafood hot pot. These entrees were fabulous with tons of flavor and  so savory. I slept like a baby after this wonderful meal. If you want to try Neo-Asian cuisine, this is the restaurant to try first. I highly recommend this restaurant!",

Today was the ramen with chicken broth, sprouts, Bok choy, lemongrass chicken, mushroom and egg. The broth alone is worth it. Packed full of flavor and thankfully they give you a soup spoon so you can savor every last drop. Also try the grapefruit lemongrass soda if they have it (flavor changes). Service is prompt and these guys really have mastered the art of ramen bowls. One of my go-to spots for sure! I will update my review when I make it here for dinner fare.",

I'm pretty confident that we didn't get VIP treatment and am very ok with that, I just don't you to view my opinion as skewed. Just the appetizers alone were fantastic! Each dish was a creative combination of flavors and textures. Hats off to the Chef for an exceptional adventure. We'll be back sometime soon, for sure! Thank you Chef",

    "text": "Wow!  I had dinner here earlier this week and was really, well....wowed!  We sat at the bar in front of the cooking action so we had a chance to get a little insight on the menu, ingredients, recommendations, etc.  We started out with the Peking duck bun.  Think Chinese taco.  It was seriously tasty, stuffed with succulent duck with a little bit of crisp on the edges and a tasty, bright dipping sauce.  Next we ordered the pig face  dumplings (cheek).  They were served on a little kimchi with their house made sriracha (they should bottle and sell the stuff).  The dumplings were tender and delicous.  The stand-out dish of the night for me was the wood grilled octopus.  I will return specifically for this dish.  As the name indicates, the pieces of octopus are wood grilled and have a slight char on them and are pile atop the crispy rice cake and surrounded by a beautiful, rich, bright and absolutely delicious broth.  This was hands down the best preparation of octopus I've ever had and it made me wonder why I'd never thought of grilling it.  It was super tender and the combo of flavors and textures - smokey, crispy, creamy, citrus, spice....superb.  Entrees did not disappoint.  We had the Kung Pao brisket with brown rice and the roasted pork ramen.  I can't say a bad thing about either dish.  From the super tender brisket in the Kung Pao and the perfectly cooked egg in the ramen, it was pure yumminess!  They somehow talked us into dessert and recommended the banana fritters served with a lush caramel sauce and their coconut rice pudding soft serve ice cream.  We practically licked the bowls clean.  Yeahhhhh...........we'll be back.  :-)",

The FOOD on the other hand.... Was terrible. I wanted to like this place so badly. Growing up in Hawaii I have spent most of my life eating Japanese food. I have had Japanese food all over the country and in japan. Out of the 7 dishes we ordered only one person liked their meal. My ramen was so bad I couldn't finish it....and considering that the portion was very small that says a lot. I left hungry. I told the waitress that I did not enjoy the meal and that most of us at the table were very disappointed...she said \"oh I'm sorry. That's too bad.\" And that was it. I've been working in service for over 15 years. I was very surprised at that response and that no one came over to ask about our experience or even to offer a drink or dessert. I didn't want or expect a comp of my meal but considering the reviews and that this place is newer I would think they would have tried to turn around a table of 7s opinion. If you want good drinks and ambiance...go. If you want great Japanese food I wouldn't recommend it.",

My girlfriend and I are newly 21 and from Washington, and were hassled way more about our ID's here than at any other restaurant that we've ordered drinks at. After showing everything from old ID's to social security cards, our server was somehow still under the impression that our ID's were fake. Clearly we had real ID's, not to mention why would someone underage attempt to purchase expensive cocktails. Once turned down by our server I asked to see a manager, believing that surely at least a manager would be able to tell a real ID from a fake, only to find that the man working with us the entire time was actually the owner. Given the situation, having an old ID and government issued social security card, we felt completely disrespected that an owner of all people still could not comprehend and assess the situation correctly.  EDIT in response to the restaurants comment: the stumble spoken of on the ID's information was a simple switch of only two digits on the address, nothing more. It is not True that we were asked for additional identification; this added information was on our own accord in response to being accused of using fake ID's, and is again not a logical thing for someone who would be using a fake ID to do. We clearly had no issue standing up for the sake of our identifications, because we were being mislabeled. We left feeling disrespected and accused of being liars when we had absolutely nothing to hide.",

It was not bad, by any means, but no one's food was fabulous and the prices were pretty high for how small the portions were.

Unfortunately the negative things have to be shared and for that I left it at a 3 star.  I will be back, hopefully within the month to hopefully see improvement.  I think the biggest thing is that this is a brand new restaurant so this is their chance to WOW their customers and I was missing a little of the WOW factor.  The food, hands down is fantastic...definately a 5 star.  We tried all of the steamed buns, a rice dish and a noodle dish and all were amazing and left us wanting to try more.  They are known for their dumplings so I wanted to try the dumplings.  I wanted to order one of each and try all 4.  \"we don't do that\" was the response I received.  You have to order 4 of one kind.  Maybe it's just me but if a customer came in to try a specific thing, I would probably take a minute to ask my boss if we can give them what they want.  You think?  This was the beginning of the bad customer service we received.  Never asked about another round of drinks and we had to find someone to get our bill for us.  I will go back and I hope that round 2 earns the extra star!",

I am pregnant, but still, that was above and beyond! And finally the food...wow. I am always a little skeptical of Asian places that mix different Asian cuisines, but I was wrong to be skeptical. Everything we had was amazing! Luckily we had a group of 5 women so we were able to try many things. We each ordered a steamed bun. I got one with tempura eggplant, tofu, basil, and aioli. The flavors together were amazing! We also tried a couple of dumplings, fried rice, and a noodle dish with broccoli, mushrooms, and a spicy cream sauce. Everything was so good, but that noodle dish was my favorite! I plan to bring my husband back here because, like me, he loves Asian food!",

    "text": "I was recommended this place by a coworker. I'm glad he told me about it, because being from Tempe, I don't get the chance to explore much of downtown Phoenix. We went for a late dinner on a Friday night. Luckily for us, it wasn't very busy, so we had no problem getting in right away. They have an open kitchen, so you can watch all sorts of neat dishes being made right in front of you. We chose to sit at the bar, and had a wonderful experience with the bartenders. We were given some recommendations for both drinks and food, and we were quite pleased with the choices we made (with the help of the bartender). They don't have a huge cocktail menu, but it will definitely satisfy your drinking desires. I had the Temperance Trap: gin, amaro, vanilla sugar and grapefruit bitter. I definitely recommend it; went perfectly with my kimchi fried rice. My boyfriend had the Enabler: 12yr Dickel with lemon juice, maple syrup & bitters. Tasty for all you whiskey lovers. We also had an order of the Massaman Curry, which is served with Udon noodles. The drinks were good, but I'd definitely say that their food is king here. Do yourself a favor and go with a big appetite!",

I had Kimchi Johnnycakes (that wasn't what they were actually called) last night that were stratospherically awesome. My friend had a noodle dish in some kind of corn miso butter broth, with beautifully marinated cherry tomatoes, that was equally mind blowing.  Emily served us and she was fantastic, recommending great things when we asked. Cocktails expertly mixed. My third time here, and I'll be back again. For those complaining, what are they comparing this place to? Yelp reviews often reveal more about the reviewers than the restaurant. Gotta read between the lines! This place is really great, worth checking out for damn sure.",

The fish sauce didn't compliment the dish which is too bad because everything else about it was perfect. Had the tuna chips. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order a 2nd time due to the vague saltiness. Tried the Brussel sprout appetizer & I'm still on the fence about this dish. I'm glad I tried it but again I wouldn't order it again. Main course was the Szechuan catfish which was highly recommended by my waiter. Again fish was cooked perfect. Very flavorful & little spicy. This dish tasted like it was created after a Vietnamese inspired catfish dish called cat-cau (forgive my spelling) . It was the best of all my selections. Although this is a ramen restaurant I didn't eat any of the ramen dishes because of the reviews. This place has an enjoyable atmosphere & food is ok but nothing to rave over. Not sure if I would want to eat here again but not disappointed that I tried it. Hope that made sense.",

I'm pretty sure a good part of my positive experience had to do with alcohol.  Let's face it, it usually does.   I decided to go for a classic Old Fashioned, and then another, and then another.   What can I say? Whatever they were doing behind the bar was working because they were delish!  Since I was drinking enough carbs, I decided to eat carbless, so I ordered some lettuce cups and wok roasted brussel sprouts.   (I also had a bite of a pork belly bun - holy cow yum).  Although it seems like I ordered the most boring items on the menu, everything I tried was outstanding and full of flavor.  I did not feel like I was skimping out on anything.  The service was very good.  Young, hip, casual guys checking in on us periodically but not overbearing.     The atmosphere is very modern and trendy which is perfect for this kind of place.   It's small so I imagine there can be a big wait at times.  This may become a new regular spot for upcoming trips to Phoenix!",

We were greeted immediately and seated. The brunch menu was basically a create your own ramen  etc with a few appetizers. To be honest this isn't really what we had in mind, but decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did. The food was great. I had ramen with, shrimp, pork broth, sprouts,carrots and snow peas. We also ordered the pig face dumplings which were spicy and amazing. The reason why I'm only rating a four star is for service. Our waitress really seemed bored and uninterested. It was slow since we were there around three and felt more of a bother than a customer. A smile and a little more acknowledgement, drink refills would have made it five star fire sure,",

The food was amazing! We started off with some dumplings which were so good, I'm usually not a fan of Siracha but I still loved the dumplings. For my entree I had the pork ramen. I told my friends who were with me that this Pork Ramen just got put on the list of the top favorite things I've ever eaten! My friend got one of the burgers and she said it was amazing! Finally, for dessert we had what I think was fried donut balls with cinnamon and caramel sauce. Definitely will be going back for a second visit here, great atmosphere, amazing food.",

    "text": "I am a huge Clever Koi fan. The food is always great.   I've come here about 7or 8 times over the last several years.   Today's experience was no exception - superior kitchen.   However we used to enjoy the service as well. Great servers who had personality, tattoos, and guided our dining experience making great recommendations. Fabulous.   Today was a little different. They have moved to a team serving style. Therefore we met no less than six people all of whom wanted to take our order, bring us things, or see if everything was ok. Which meant that we had to tell several people that we had already ordered, the guy who did take our order looked confused/perturbed that no one had already had taken our order (he looked around and said, I guess I'll take your order) and people we had not met actually delivered our food. A little chaotic. NBD. No fewer than three people said, \"first time here?\"  When we received our food (sensational Banh Mi, not very authentic but great), one of our waiters asked if we wanted a second round of drinks - we said \"sure.\"  Fifteen to twenty minutes later, as we finished our light meal, the drinks - a beer and a glass of wine arrived. We'd already written them off as MIA. Again, NBD.   At this point the nice young woman in a great Guns N Roses UK t-shirt looked confused and said \"but it's been poured.\"  I still don't understand the relevance of the comment. I said it was too late, we were leaving and I'd like my check. She apologized and got a manager. Here is the odd thing - all six or so people wanted to apologize so we had a parade of people I had barely met offering free drinks, one offered to comp the meal, and a profusion of \"we're so sorry!\"  I didn't want a fuss or an apology. I just didn't want to pay for drinks that arrived too late to enjoy them with our food. I refused the offer of a free meal. I just wanted to leave after this \"tsunami of apology.\" They made a big deal out of a tiny incident.   Conclusion - I'm sure a team serving approach works well somewhere. However this was bad.   I'm sure the server who put in the drink order went about his duties. I'm sure the bartender might have gotten busy. I'm also sure that if the waiter was watching the tables he owned, he would have bugged the bartender and said, \"I need those drinks now!\"  However it was obvious no one had primary ownership of my table so if there is a hiccup in the service no one sees it. Finally, it seemed to take a committee to comp those last drinks. \"Service By Committee\" was ineffective and heavy handed.",

    "text": "It's a trendy asian fusion restaurant with unique menu items and creative drinks.  We started with the pig face and goat cheese dumplings.  The pig face was pretty average. Although pork belly and hoisin sauce is amazing the whole dish was overpowered by the sriracha but the goat cheese dumplings were great! The goat cheese was super creamy and melty while the sweetness of the beats were a perfect compliment.   I have an obsession with ramen so I try to order it everywhere I go, so naturally I got the pork ramen. The broth was average but the pork belly was cooked decently. They also put kimchi in the dish and although I love kimchi, I think I would of preferred it without.   Overall it's an a nice place, good ambiance for dates or a casual dinner with drinks.",

    "text": "So disappointing!   We started off with the calamari fries and steamers. The calamari fries were okay, but the batter didn't have much flavor/seasoning. There was also no lemon or dipping sauce with them. Some sauce was drizzled on top, but overall they tasted plain.  The steamers looked incredible and i really wanted to like them but they were SO SALTY. All i could taste was salt. I wasn't able to get past the saltiness of the dish.  We then ordered two steamed buns - pork belly and chicken and waffles. The first thing i noticed was how small they were! My boyfriend could finish one in two bites. And for $4 each you'd think you'd get just a little more. The pork belly one was decent, but the chicken and waffles wasn't so good. The chicken was dry and the waffle bun was soggy and fell apart while you were eating it. The most confusing part of the plate was that it came with a side of dipping sauce? It was way unnecessary and didn't fit with either steamed bun we ordered.   Lastly, we thought we'd try the scallop dumplings. Also looked pretty good when they came out, but were also extremely disappointing. I don't know what was in them, but it did NOT taste like scallops, or even seafood. The filling was dry and the closest thing it tasted like was chicken. The sauce on it was confusing. Did not meld well at all. I don't know what kind of flavors they were shooting for, but it was a complete miss.  Our meal after tip was over $60 (including drinks). We left hungry and unsatisfied. The atmosphere was awesome and we were excited to try someplace new, but unfortunately we will not be coming back.",

    "text": "I've been here for dinner and been here for happy hour.    Setting:  5 Star - modern, clean, cool, beautiful - everything you want in a trendy hot restaurant.  Service:  5 Star - nice staff, attentive management, felt welcome  Food:  3-4 Star - Everything is pretty good.  Small portions.  Most things are clearly premade and just reheated, which makes sense for many items.    Value:  2-3 Star - Except on Happy Hour, everything just felt too expensive for the quality of food and quantity.  Not terribly expensive, but just expensive.  It's tapas size portions, which is fine, but when you are paying $8-9 for a tapas size portion, it adds up!  I've been here twice.  First time I ate the regular menu on a daddy-daughter night out, and that was nice.  I enjoyed most things on the menu that I tried.  I had noticed the happy hour menu/prices, and was excited to try.  Second time, came back with two kids and wife for happy hour.    NOTE:  Menu has changed, and is NOT the same as is on their website.  It's more expensive now!  Happy Hour prices seem to have gone up a couple bucks per item.  No longer a great deal, just an okay one.  We ordered beers and mixed drinks.  Tasty all round.  We ordered three orders of the pork soup, which was good but the ramen sure tasted a lot like the stuff you get at a supermarket, even if everything around it was top notch.  All the appetizers were tasty.  Just not outstanding.  So two kids, two adults, two drinks.  $80 with tip.  Filled us up.  My wife, who usually isn't one to be cheap, said:  \"That didn't feel like it was worth the $80.\"  I wavered a bit and would probably agree, but at the same time I didn't feel like it was terrible for what we ate.  Just don't go back thinking happy hour is some amazing deal.    It WAS, then the owner raised prices.   But if you have a very light appetite, I could think of a LOT worse places to go for Happy Hour (which goes till 7) on a date.",

Guests who had arrived and were seated 5-10 min after we ordered, received their meals before we did. That could have been overlooked but the service we received was absolutely awful. It seemed like a battle to get more water while we were waiting for our food. The bartender filled up our waters half way and then never returned to fill them back up. It's hot outside and water should be the one thing that never stays empty at a table. Overall the food was decent but the service is what will keep us away.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to check this place out and I had an old family friend in town who also likes Asian food so I grabbed the neighbors and headed down to check out an establishment that has been on the top of my \"to do\" list when it comes to eating out, for some time, The Clever Koi.  First, though we drove this time, it is easy to get to this place by getting off at the Indian School and Central light rail station (it is right next door to one of the great dive bars of Phoenix, the George and the Dragon), and first off, the building it is in is beautiful - wonderful modern architecture that makes this establishment especially inviting. Being on the thrifty side, we went for the happy hour that goes from 4 pm to 7 pm every day and I think we pretty much had every food item on the happy hour list.   I have to admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the Edamame fritters ( a bit too dry) but the mini corn dog bites with Chinese sausage in the middle and the Chinese mustard (not too hot) and sriracha ketchup were great. I also liked the grilled veggi platter and both the lemongrass chicken and bulgogi beef additions were quite good. Oh they also do sriracha chicken wings that are worth getting and I was told they make the sriracha sauce in house. Oh, and the mini-corn dogs came with some small relishes (house pickled veggies), a sweet, thinly sliced cucumber and some pickled onions, both excellent.  Probably the highlight of the meal for me was what i would say is the best ramen I've head in Phoenix and really, some of the better ramen I've had almost anywhere - the sauce was flavorful and the noodles were cooked but not too soft - it came with a perfectly soft boiled egg, sliced in half, and too roasted pieces of pork belly that were delicious. I look forward to eating a lot more of this when the weather cools down.  As for drinks, excellent cocktails. I had a Pimm's cup and they do a great one, and I also had a dark and stormy made with in-house crafted all-spice bitters. Besides the cocktails (and I love me some cocktails) a nice local beer selection and I'm assuming a good wine selection. The one beer I was surprised not to see on the menu, was Hitachino Nest Beer, probably the best craft beer from Japan, it would be a natural for the overall selection of drinks and a perfect fit for the ramen.   Oh, and because I believe if you are going to try a new place, you might as well go all the way, we had desert. The soft serve of the day was good but I'm not a huge ice cream fan. However, the peach fritters are what we call malasadas back in Hawaii, and are a fried round of sweet dough, rolled in sugar, and they were amazing here - and here is a fingers crossing to the chef changing the name to malasadas, where I think are a better description of this desert.  As for areas of improvement, not much, the service was great with a friendly server and other wait staff that quickly removed used plates and glasses and brough ice water on a regular basis. We needed the ice water because, for some reason, it was a bit on the warm side, or at least it seemed that way to me.   All this being said, I truly enjoyed my dining experience. The location is a good one, right off the rail line, the building and establishment are beautiful, and the food and drinks are extremely good, at least from my perspective. Accordingly, if you are looking for a new place to try out, I strongly encourage you to consider checking out the Clever Koi and sharing your own perspective on Yelp. I'll be interested to see what you think. :-)",

    "text": "What a disappointing experience. We had wanted to get into this place after experiencing their craft cocktails at a local festival. After always trying to get a reservation on open table but it showing it was booked we decided to call. As it turns out they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We went and waited at the bar for a table. The cocktails were great although my drink was about 3 sips so not great for the price. At our table we were served one by one. My friends husbands meal came out first then my husbands came out cold and without chicken as requested then my friends came out steaming hot. My food came out so late everyone was nearly done with their food. My husband told them he was missing his chicken and he received it after finishing his meal. Our servers switched during the meal and when asking for our bill they asked us if we had a bottle of wine (which we didn't). They also took away our heat lamp during our meal for another table. We asked that we keep it as it was cold and they said they would bring another which they weren't able to light. It seemed as if they knew they missed the mark when we left but in no way offers to come anything (even the chicken my husband didn't eat because it came out so late). The service was really poor and the food was not amazing. Maybe it is an okay place for a drink but don't waste your time on a meal.",

    "text": "Had a great time at this Asian fusion restaurant in cenpho with friends last night! The patio was perfect for a March evening, and wasn't loud like I thought it would be for being on a busy street. We all started with cocktails and I ordered the sloe burn (I love bourbon/whiskey) - it was really good. Very complex flavors and a little spice at the end. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of anything in the whiskey category.  We each ordered a steamed bun and I had the Peking duck - the bun is a little more taco-esque than your typical steam bun, but the meat was tender and the sauce that came with it is awesome. My husband had the catfish and it was my favorite. The pineapple tartar sauce on it is awesome.   We all ended up getting noodles for our main dishes. I got the pork ramen. I am a novice ramen connoisseur but do enjoy a good bowl of ramen - it was very good. The kicker is that it's topped with the sexiest slow poached egg I've ever seen in my life, just oozy and silky perfect with the broth and the pork. The kale in the ramen didn't really work for me, it had an acidic taste to it that I wasn't in to, but the noodles were cooked well and the pork/bacon was delicious. The broth was nice, not super heavy. I tried the curry that my husband got and it was awesome - great spicy flavor with coconut and peppers. Those udon noodles were on point.   All in all, we had a good time. I would go back for happy hour, they have good drink specials and appetizers!",

    "text": "I like to research a restaurant before trying it and I was super excited to eat here. I went there tonight with my bf and all in all, I found it disappointing.  They cram the people in like sardines, with tables literally having maybe a foot in between one another. It was also incredibly loud. So much so that we had to ask our server repeatedly to reiterate what he was saying while also hearing the conversations, word for word, of everyone in a ten foot perimeter. How romantic.  Now to the food.   I got the Kung Pao Wings and what I received was...odd. Here I was thinking they'd be like every other chicken wing that I've had at a restaurant. Nope. They serve you the ENTIRE wing: tip, joints, and all. So you get this big, awkward, boney wing with sticky sauce all over. So as I'm trying to figure out how to eat this thing, the sauce gets everywhere; only part of the wing itself is crispy and the other part is fatty and mushy, and overall it was the biggest letdown of the night. I love chicken wings and this was a big disappointment. Staff of Clever Koi: warn people when ordering this dish! My server saw my struggles but clearly did not care or try to make things easier. Thanks man.  Next I got the Pork Belly ramen and my bf got the broccolini and beef. The ramen was okay. In my opinion there were too many flavors trying to vie for attention and not all of them were good. The broccolini and beef was delicious, although there were maybe only 3 pieces of beef in the entire bowl. Being a foodie, I hate expecting good things from a restaurant only to be severely let down and out a good chunk of change. Not sure if I'll be back.",
