The atmosphere was inviting. I will definitely be going back. Oh yeah. I forgot my card going out to my car, but the waitress tracked me down. The only thing I was thinking was how can I give them a bigger tip.",

We went in the middle of lunch (I don't know why) around 12:15, and despite 100 degree temp we sat on the patio at the bar.  It was warm, but the shade and misters helped.  We shared a \"slice,\" which is 2 pieces, and some wings.  We usually prefer the wing of the wings over the drums, but did not have that option.  The wings were fantastic!  The medium sauce was the perfect heat.  We washed this down with a couple of cold beers and left again with a smile.  Thank you Oregano's.",

Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait.   Lindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14\" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either.   Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie!",

Speaking of cold ... the main dishes were cold as well when they came out ... When something was said and the manager came over ... she made some excuse that her pasta maker tonight \"was working extremely fast\" ... and thats why we got the cold pasta before the cold bread ...  She then offered us a free cookie due to it ... but why take it ? So it could come out hard as a rock with melted ice cream ... and still was charged for the bread and cold pasta ...  It will be an EXTREMELY long time before we ever visit here again ...  VERY DISAPPOINTING !!!",

When I showed him the pizza he said he could get me some extra pieces of pepperoni. I ask his name which he said was Nate.  And I said thank you I said I was going to leave a review and I walked out of the restaurant at which time he repeated his name 3 times. He kept saying my name is Nate, Nate is my name , my name is Nate.  He was rude and the pizza is not worth the money.  But, the salad is good.",

Our waitress (?) Lili, didn't bother with us for quite a few minutes.  We asked for water which never arrived.  We finally asked another server for water.  My friend ordered chicken Alfredo.  When it arrived, it was lacking enough sauce to cover the chicken and pasta.   My dinner companion didn't eat most of his meal because of being to dry.  I had spaghetti  with marinara sauce.  There was so little sauce on it that I ended up leaving most of the spaghetti because it was completely dry.  They seem to be getting chintzy with their sauces. We both felt that this was probably the last time we would go there.  We were ignored by the waitress (she spent plenty of time with the two men next to use, however.) By the way, we didn't ask for more sauce because the server ignored us most of the time! Not a great dinner experience.",

But we were warned that certain pizza selections would take about 45 minutes.   When our pizza arrived, we were hungry enough to eat any type of pizza that was brought out.   Unfortunately, even though it had been over an hour, we received a significantly uncooked pizza. Just above the moderately cooked bottom crust, the dough was very undercooked (doughy). The gummy dough was prominent in each bite.   Things happen. We certainly understand this. But when we brought our undercooked pizza to the attention of the server, she spoke with the manager who sent the server back with instructions on how we could cook the rest of our pizza (over half remaining) at home.  We did not want or request a refund. However, we thought a cooked pizza was in order.   I'm sure this had to be an isolated issue, but we were shocked that we were told how to cook the pizza, rather than the restaurant just doing that in the first place or offering to finish cooking our food.   I believe most people go to a restaurant to have its kitchen staff prepare the food. We do make pizza at home, but it wasn't our intention when going to Oregano's.    We still paid the full price, tipped the server but tossed the pizza. We'll likely go back, but to a classier location.",

Misc. info in random order: * They know how to run a successful, extremely busy restaurant, so they're efficient and smart about it. They've got stuff  figured out such as: when you order the cookie to go, they bring out the ice cream at the very last minute. *  Staff is friendly and, again, usually efficient. *  They'll usually offer to fill up a to-go cup with your drink when you leave, at least when you eat at the bar. *  The caramelized onions are not caramelized. They're just cooked onions. * Don't order the large size deep dish pan pizza because the dough on the bottom tends to be too thick. On the smaller size, it's good. Actually, on the individual size, the dough is perfect. *  The giant pan cookie is great if you like under-cooked cookies, which I do. If you're not a fan of cookie dough (though it's not actually cookie dough), consider skipping it. *  Brussels sprouts are a bit of a disappointment, at least for me. Although plentiful, they're under-seasoned and not cooked enough for my taste. I like them drowning in whatever they're seasoned with, and I like them crisped and preferably charred.",

The service was fast, courteous, & friendly. It has a great family/neighborly vibe with very positive & fun energy of the staff.   It does get busy really fast so if you have a large group I would strongly suggest getting there early or making reservations.  Be sure to save room for the Pizza Cookie w/Ice Cream.",

When we arrived, the hostess took our order (pizzas take about 45 minutes) and we were inside in about an half hour. GREAT PIZZA and that is from a pretentious chicago pizza snob. The pizza was spiced well, plenty of sausage, and the pan pizza crust was the right amount of chewy.  We also ate a pizzookie. (A cookie baked in a pizza pan, with ice cream and chocolate sauce).

    "text": "I ordered some Oreganos via Postmates tonight because I'm too tired to deal with the crazyness of a Friday night dinner rush. Postmates said 60-70 minutes, I was like \"that's kinda long for some pasta and a salad but I'm really in the mood for it so I'll wait\". 30 minutes later I get a phone call from our postmates driver who is now there to pick up our food, who is told that there will be an additional 90 minute wait. I was flabbergasted! So I called the store and asked for a manager and got Cynthia who claimed to be the General Manager AS WELL as a managing partner. Cynthia sounded like she wasn't happy about the fact that she was busy on a Saturday night and she wanted to take that out on me. When I asked here how long the wait was if I were to order 2 pastas and a salad, she said \"30-40min\" and then I asked her why my postmates driver was told it was a 90 minute wait, her response was hostile, raising her voice to tell me that postmates is not her priority, that the dinning room customers come first, followed by pick ups that call them directly then postmates. When I asked for a phone number to file a complaint about her attitude and this procedure, she exclaimed \" I don't understand what you're going to complain about, I told you I could have your food ready in 35 minutes!\" To which I replied \"unless I order through postmates, then I have to wait an additional 90 minutes.\" She said \" LOOK! We don't even have a contract with postmates! If you want to complain here's our corporate number!\" After rattling that off, she then decided to tell me she was a managing partner as if that was going to discourage me from complaining. Cynthia, my money is just as green as everyone else's no matter how I ordered. There shouldn't be a hierarchy between postmates pick ups and regular pick ups. If your kitchen can't handle the volume then you shouldn't extend your establishment to services such as postmates. To those reading this review, save your money and go a couple blocks over to a real Chicago joint \"Lou Malnatis\" where hospitality is a dish served warm unlike this Oreganos. I've never encountered such a rude manager in my life. I'll keep my money thank you.",

When we arrived we were asked to walk back outside and wait. Every family after us had the luxury of waiting inside in the AC. Our server Eureka* took our order and repeated what we ordered back. My pizza was incorrect and had a piece of plastic in it. It seemed like we waited a really long time for cold and incorrect pizza. I've frequent this location and won't be back again.

My entree was prepared and served quicker then expected. Today I ordered the stuffed crust pizza, and a salad.  The salad was served cold, and the ingredients were fresh. The pizza was good, but not the best I ever had at Oreganos (little soggy).   The prices are a bit higher than average, but not unreasonable. I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went to this location on Saturday for a late night meal.  He loves oreganos; I'm on the fence with the food. We sat at the bar a little before 9:30 pm.  It wasn't too busy on the patio, but it looked like some people were still waiting.  A server asked us if we were drinking or dining, and then when we said dining, she found the bar tender.  Bartender was a very nice blonde young woman.  She made some suggestions.  I ordered an Alfredo pasta w tigre shrimp, and he had the boLL o Rama (never ending pasta bowl) with a side sausage and an ice t. I also ordered a small side salad (it was huge, cold, crisp and fresh; very good.  Very little ice berg of any).  I asked for a side of balsamic vinaigrette and side of blue cheese.  I wanted to try their dressings.  I don't like many; the blue was good.    So, as we waited for our water, tea and salad, my fiance and I watched the bartender dump the ice tea glass by glass down the sink.  Someone gave us water (it had a bad taste to it), and my fiance finally said to the bar tender, \"Hey, are you going to dump all of that?\".  She smiled, said yes, and Jon then said \"Could I have some then before you dump it?\".  She giggled, and he told her he ordered it.  She clearly forgot.  Food came out (ticket time was long).  As mentioned before, salad was good.  Fiance asked for a a small side of ranch, he didn't like the balsamic.  Jon enjoyed his pasta and sausage.  My Alfredo was dry.  I asked for a little more sauce(FYI-I don't like a lot of sauce or dressing, so if I think it's dry, it probably is).  It was brought out.  Alfredo sauce was ok, but shrimp beautiful, plump, and cooked right.  Props on that.  I'd like to order with w a salad Next time.    So, fiance orders another bowl of pasta. It's a little after 10 (closing time).  Plenty of people are still dining.  Some people even same in right before 10.  Bartender said it was probably too late, and said she should have asked.  Sorry, THERE IS NO SECONDS ON A BOLLO RAMA.  She gives us the bill, and we look at the extras.  She still charged jon for the tea that took a good while to receive.  He ordered that when he sat down, before the meal.    She charged us for a side of dressing.  She charged us for a side of sauce for my dry pasta that looked like it was hanging under the heat lamp.    My fiance didn't  want to say anything about the charges, even though he was irritated.  He placed his card in the check book, and as the bartender reached for it, I had to ask her about the charges regarding the sauce and dressing.  He got the tea, 20 minutes after he ordered it, but got it.  She said she'd take off the Alfredo sauce since my pasta was dry.  He was still irked.  Paid the bill, and as we were walking out, the manager on duty, Cynthia, said goodnight.  She mentioned how they brought me extra sauce to make the Alfredo dish even better.  When I heard her say that, I had to stop and mention all of the grievances.  Long ticket time, long drink time, two unnecessary charges. I did say the bartender was nice, but perhaps more concerned about getting off work.    Cynthia offered another bowl of pasta.  We declined.  It was thoughtful. I told her that my fiance loved the restaurant, but irked.  She said to let them know to take care of us, and mention her name.    CYNTHIA, and other managers, I will.  Sometimes customer service beats out amazing food.  My fiance loves this place, I don't.  But, if you provide excellent customer service, I will keep stopping in.  I hope you will as promised :) thank you, Cynthia.  You actually made me feel a bit better about going back one more time.",

I arrived at 6PM and ... first person couldn't find my order.  Second person found the order, but the pizza wouldn't be ready for another 10 minutes.  6:15PM ... still no pizza.  Hostess went to check again - still no status.  6:20PM ... I requested to speak to a manager.  He apologized to me, but told me that it wasn't their fault because the timing shown for online orders isn't correctly tied into their kitchen's status.  He gave me a gift card & told me that my pizza would be out shortly.  6:32PM ... pizza!  They pulled my soup & fries out from behind the counter where they had been sitting for the past half hour, bundled my order up, and I headed home.  6:35PM ... home.    Results: -Fries -- totally soggy from sitting in a box for 35+ minutes. -Pizza -- center of the thin crust pizza wasn't completely cooked.  meh.  Oregano's is right ... this situation wasn't their fault.  It my fault for ordering a pizza from Oregano's.",

The onions were NOT Caramelized. Sauteed?  Only reason I care is that I don't like onions at all unless they are grilled or caramelized. The thin crust was good. The pepperoni, sauce and cheese was tasty. The sausage- outstanding. I probably would have rated a 4. Pretty good pizza. Not provel cheese, but the pizza reminded me of St Louis style and I like that.",

The staff, cleanliness and food quality here falls way, way below every other location I've dined with in the past. They have completely botched my last three consecutive carry-out orders. I completely looked the other way on the first one. The second one was pretty annoying (especially after having to repeat the order three times over the phone)--but still, no complaint from me. Tonight, they botched it again (again, had to place my order twice). I've had it. There are just too many solid pizza joints in this town. What a shame.",

We went to dine-in on a Sunday afternoon and while although there was about a 20-30 minute wait, the area outside was nice, we had a glass of wine and enjoyed ourselves. (If you are really hungry, get on the waiting list on yelp before you go!) When we were finally seated, our table was in the back of the restaurant, so we got to walk through nearly the entire restaurant. Very cool decor, very different, and eye catching, but very cool. I really liked the feeling inside the restaurant.  We were greeted by our smiling server, who did provide excellent service all the way through.  The food was very good. I say 4 out of 5, maybe because I grew up eating authentic Italian food, so my standards are high, but you will enjoy the food. I got the shroom boom pasta (pictured below) and added a sausage and meatball. I wasn't expecting an entire piece of sausage, but it was tasty. The meatball was top notch. We also started with the boom dip, which was also amazing (not the healthiest) but AMAZING. My husband had El diablo shrimp pasta, added like me, a sausage and a meat ball, and although not usually a pasta lover, enjoyed his meal. He said he would order again.  We like having this spot in the neighborhood and plan to visit very soon. It just really seems like the perfect Sunday place for us, as Sunday's are reserved for carbs, and lots of them!",

Cannot comment on service otherwise since I didn't experience it but I was enthusiastically greeted a couple times while in the restaurant. The food at Oregano's is always delicious, great portions, and very good prices. This was my first time trying sausage as an add-on to pasta and wow!!",

Oh and pay attention when you are waiting for your seats. Because they mess up the waiting list a lot. They like to do their friends favors by letting them have the tables first.",

Once co-served by John. The experience couldn't be better. The food was served piping hot, the service was absolutely wonderful. The servers seem genuine in their charisma, charm and joy of serving.   My first trip, I had the Rig-a Tony. absolutely fabulous. The rigatoni was cooked al dente, the sauce was phenomenal, and the cheese melted and browned on top. Mmmm..mmm!  My second trip in, I had the angel hair pasta with meat sauce and a gigantic meatball. Again, the sauce was phenomenal. The pasta was cooked just right and the Meatball was crazy good.   I love the display of old paintings and other old knick-knacks, it really reminds me of Grandma's house. I love that the recipes are the families own instead of a manufactured replica of a family tradition.  And finally, I love the management here. Cynthia has a smile that lights up the room. Her professionalism is unmatched, as I've seen her in action with an unsavory guest. Handling the situation with vigor and resolve, yet still hitting the floor, if you will, unscathed.    I would serious recommend anyone wanting GREAT Italian food and attentive, joyful service to come here. And always remember T I P S = To Insure Proper Service. Tip your server, you'll be glad you did.",

In fact, I think it's my new secret hangout! (well, not now that I've told all of you!)  The patio in the back is just enough removed from the hustle bustle of Camelback that you feel like you're completely out of the fray. This is accomplished with Oregano's signature ambiance. Lights, trees, murals, best music ever!  I can't wait for my next visit. Oh, and EVERY SINGLE employee we encountered was happy, engaged and pleased to please us! AND the place was clean!

    "text": "There's no end of fancy schmancy pasta places out there, with the accompanying fancy schmancy price.  Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.  Look, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a \"cheap pasta place\" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.  Oregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the \"Bollo Pasta\" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.  This is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.  Is it the absolute best pasta taste?  No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.  Oh, and their pizza is pretty good too.",

I just picked up a Mac n cheese and a pizza  and unfortunately the Mac and cheese hit the ground and half of it spilled onto the parking lot at my car.   Shit happens.  I picked it all up and went back in and asked if they could replace it.  The manager said he couldn't replace it without charging for it again because \"they made it right.\"  Menu price is $5.49. Oregano's cost?  Maybe $1.   Never once in 25 years in any kitchen have I said that we couldn't or wouldn't replace it without charging, because we appreciated our customers and their business .  Would you charge me twice if my 4 year old knocked it on the ground and were at a table?  Or if your server dropped it?   The idea that you are ok with me delivering sub-par parking lot spiced Mac and cheese tells me many things.  Mainly you don't care about your job, your reputation or your food.  I have many friends in the industry and this story will go long and far.  Enjoy.",

We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.  So rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.     Like my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's True that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too.   Knowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.  So all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!",

He did a fantastic job by himself. Waters were already on the table when we got there. He quickly got our drink and appetizer orders and then told us he is going to get our drink and appetizer orders in. He was quick with the drinks.   The food took awhile. I know all 20 of us ordered different items, so the timing of when all the food is ready took awhile longer than usual. But is is serving 20 people all at 1 time. Like usual the food was tasty, good, and consistent. I tried the Zany Ziti with chicken. Yum and TON of food!   Of course we had to order the half and half pzookie!",

    "text": "When I lived in Arizona a million years ago, an Oregano's took over my favorite little local bar-ish place. I boycotted them for six months (which worked out fine - the place was packed all the time) until a friend insisted we go. Then I wanted to eat all the things on the menu. I never got their deep dish pie, though, having always had deep dish that is at least 1/3 bread, and not even good bread. Well, while back in the area for graduation I told my husband that Oregano's makes a deep dish that takes (and they're not lying) at least 45 minutes to make. He was insistent, so we got one. OMG, I deprived myself for so long! Why?? A piece is a meal into itself, but so worth it. With the toppings in the middle, a supporting center crust, and the sauce on top, you get a slab of deliciousness without a giant chunk of bread. Go. Go now. Wait your hour but know it's worth it!",

    "text": "So, I was dining at Oregano's with a couple of love birds and finally I got fed up with the pda's. Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. \"Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing.\"  I came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?    Anyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.  Here are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza.   pizza Not a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some  food whores, but not me.     bruschetta  Please tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.  guaca-tony How do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.  yam fries/sweet po's Yum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone.   salad  On a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.  BEGIN SIDE NOTE Best salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb  idea was that? END SIDE NOTE  Veggie Wedgie sandwich.   Skip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.  scampi The love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.  pizza cookie The only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa! (Not playa as in the beach, playa as in play-er.)",

The pasta dish did not fully satisfy only because adding protein to the dish was disappointing. FYI adding meatballs to your dish means ONE meatball to your dish for $3.50. I repeat- just one.   But, not to be discouraged! Pizza here is always comforting! :)",

We were told it would be a 30 min wait to be seated outside and an hour wait to sit inside so we chose to sit outside since we had our son who was sleeping. we waited over an hour and sat there and watched 4 tables open up and we were never seated. my son woke up from his nap was  upset and at that point we decided to get up and leave and once I said something they had the nerve to say they were just about to sit us down when those tables were opened up for 15-20 mins. Maybe If they weren't so busy talking to each other and paying attention then they would of notice that all those tables opened up. AND the guy had the nerve to say if you want to leave you can just leave. Never going back to the oreganos on camelback again!",

We usually do our fam dinners out on Fridays so a Saturday night was new. Well an hour after putting our order in and my son telling me for 20 minutes how hungry he was. I decided we had waited long enough and asked the nearest waiter for our tab for our drinks. Well he must've been the manager or something because he jumped into action super quickly. Had I said something sooner, we probably would have eaten sooner. He brought our dishes right over and even a desert and then took care of the food portion of the bill. The kitchen got super bombarded so none of this was our waiters fault, he came over about 4/5 times making sure we were good and telling us he was checking for our orders. So in the end, aside from the backup in the kitchen - we had amazing customer service and of course when the food is brought over it was amazing, as always. I was super thankful to both of our waiters. Kick butt guys! We'll see ya again soon (but maybe on a Friday), haha!",

Once inside, I understood why it was packed.  The atmosphere was poppin' and all I saw were smiling faces with amazing looking dishes in front of them.  We sat in a booth surrounded by 50s nostalgia.  Our servers (we had a 2fer.. on the job training) were very friendly and super funny.  The newbie server was too funny.  He was learning the menu along with us! haha. :P  His trainer suggested we try the Huge Guaca-Tony for starters.  THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION!  It was sooo delicious and filling. I couldn't even finish my salad! haha.  Our entrees:  Pablo Picasso Mexican Salad Big Rig Pasta The Ol' Mexigano  The Pablo salad was HUGE - matter factly all of it was, but yeah.  That bowl is more like a 2 person dish.  It was a perfect blend of Mexican flavors.  I was able to eat just a few bites though because I was stuffed from the appetizer!  My son had the Big Rig.  The plate was probably the size of my laptop.  I had a taste of his dish and I almost had regrets in getting the salad instead.  The pasta was seasoned all the way through and the chipotle cream was the cherry on top of this mound of yumminess.  I had no room for the Mexigano, but according to my hubby... it was so good he was NOT going to share. lol  Even though we never eat at the same place twice in PHX, I would definitely put this up there with Lenny's on trying a second time :P",

We always got one to eat at the restaurant and one to take home, ALWAYS! Out of all the times we've been there which is probably, (not even exaggerating) about 15 times (in a few months span, we are poor why are we even eating out?!?!), we've never had a problem or been told that we couldn't do that. Well, the last time we were there they boxed up our first order to go when it wasn't supposed to be. Not a big deal, and an honest mistake, but they seemed annoyed when we told them it wasn't to go and we wanted to eat there. They brought it out for us to eat there, forgot the extra stuff we ordered, we asked for it, and they were for some reason annoyed about that. We go to get our one to go, like we ALWAYS do and are then informed that they couldn't not give us a takeout one because we split the bowl. It doesn't say that anywhere on the menu. And also the 15 other times we've been there, no one, NOT ONE person EVER said anything like that to us. Spoke to the manager, he was rude, so yeah, not going back there anymore. I know they don't care but had to get it out there. Sucks because it's soooo good.",

We had a great waitress which I felt bad for since they were short staffed (only 2 waitresses at night!) and kept having to run around. I had already been disenchanted with this place once but decided to try it again. Meh.. they changed their marinara sauce which used to be delicious! Now it tastes worse than Prego so no more lasagna for me. They got rid of their stuffed raviolis appetizer and now serve chips? (Not very italian). Decided to try the Shrimp scampi which I used to love as well. My food was cold and bland, no flavor whatsoever. So disappointed because this literally used to be my favorite restaurant. What happened??!!!",

Lance S. and I went here last night to binge before starting a 10 Day \"Master Cleanse\" fast today.  Something I never noticed before, but highly appreciate, is that their wines by the glass are VERY inexpensive.  Since I made the switch to wine as my exclusive drink of choice a couple years ago, my restaurant bills have pretty much doubled, but at Oregano's I can go drink for drink with Lance and his tall Bud Lights without being the asshole who added $30 to our bill in booze, so that's always good.  As I said before, I'm not crazy about their pizza, but their appetizers and salads are delicious, and they have a gigantic cookie on the menu so you can't really go wrong there.  I haven't tried the pasta either, but that's another type of food I have impossibly high standards for restaurants to meet, so I'm probably not the best critic.  Basically, Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.  If you think you don't like Oregano's, there's something wrong with you. You should probably go to Oregano's, get a $5 glass of house white and some apps, and work that out.",

    "text": "Didn't go in here expecting much. Being from Chicago, I craved some really good deep dish pizza and saw this place made it, so I stopped in. Parking was tight. Small parking lot in the back with little to no parking on a busy night... There was a half hr wait but we seated instantly at the bar. Not my ideal seating but I don't like waiting, so it is what it is. Bartender was friendly. Tried the Belini? An alcoholic slushi drink someone else had posted a picture of. I could be completely wrong on the name. Wasn't as strong as I'd like, but tasty. We got a big caesar salad to start. Was big enough for two people. Was just ok...kind of dry in my opinion. Definitely could've used more dressing. Probably wouldn't get again- their other salads look a lot better anyways. Somehow in all this, we changed our minds about deep dish (sorry chi town), and went with a \"make your own\" thin crust. I got sausage, pepperoni, spiced feta, roasted garlic, and spinach on my half and my husband got sausage, pepperoni, garlic, and bacon on his. I was a little worried about my choices and how they'd turn out shortly after we placed the order. Those ingredients can definitely overwhelm a pizza. The wait was usual...half hr maybe? Lemme tell you.....that pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten.......they didn't put TOO much of each topping, so you didn't get too much of one flavor overpowering another (aka garlic or feta). Everything blended perfectly and was so stinkin delicious I never wanted it to end......my husband loved his just as much.  Overall for the salad, pizza, 2 beers, 2 \"specialty\" drinks, and a tip....the final bill came to around $77. Kind of expensive in my opinion. Adding your own toppings individually can get kind of pricey so I'd probably get a pizza off the menu choices next time? Even though the make your own combo I got was DIVINE.... I'm giving this place 4 stars because despite some minor setbacks, the pizza was absolutely PERFECT. The pricing dissapoints me the most really. If it were cheaper, I'd frequent here once a week. Lol.",

    "text": "First off I have to preface this with the fact that I just love Oregano's! Their food is the bomb and I have yet to find something on the menu that I don't like. Thursday we went for a coworker's birthday lunch and no one was disappointed. There was a big group of 12 of us and we were seated right away. Our waiter came right over to take our drink orders and was very friendly. I had the Pablo Picasso salad. And for anybody that has ever eaten here you know how huge their salads are! I always ask for the dressing on the side because I can't ever finish the whole thing. It has just the right amount of spice mixed in with the chicken, tomatoes, cheese, tortilla strips, and whatever else is mixed in with it. And they do not skimp at all on all the good stuff. Our entire table was pleased with their meals and our server was fabulous keeping all of our drinks refilled and bringing out a couple of cookie pizzas at the end for our birthday folks. Their lunch specials are great and the \"heckuva\" slice you can get for under three dollars is a great bargain. Pair it with a side salad and you have a filling lunch that won't break the bank. It is one of our most requested lunch places for birthdays at our work because everyone is sure to get something they love.",

It was close to impossible to order a drink or anything else from our server, we had to flag her down before she ran away every time. The calamari was all breading and no squid. The Pizza was sub par, veggies tasted old. The server also added gratuity without even asking, which I thought was a little rude considering the sub par service. Oh, and to top it all off, I got FOOD POISONING an hour after we left. So no, I don't think the $100 we spent there was worth it considering it left my body shortly after. Won't be coming back.",

Why not 5 stars? With that being said, I have had some mom and pop Italian places that are absolutely unbeatable. We do not go to Olive Garden as it is bland. Oreganos? Anything but bland! They pack in the flavor on every dish I have ever had. I cook with a lot of flavor and I also expect to get it when I eat out. I don't do blah.  I love the degree of flavor this place dishes out.   I got the Riga Tony (yes that's how they spell it here) and added meatballs. The fact that I finished my entire huge plate is a good sign. Or a bad one depending on how you look at it lol.  Full of flavor. My mom got the scampi pasta dish which was wonderful but it def has a spicy kick to it! My sister got the thin crust pepperoni pizza which was good. And no.. They didn't forget the pepperoni it's under the cheese! Haha. We wanted to finish strong with the calories so we got a pazzuki (cookie pizza with ice cream. SOO good. They bring out the cookie hot and a tad underdone to perfection.  We had a great server.  Negatives:  It does take quite some time for your food to arrive.. But I guess if you want fresh you gotta wait.",

Surprisingly, when I explained what happened to the tall, sexy man who was managing the kitchen, he didn't even question me. Instead, he hollars back to the cooks to give him two side orders of chicken.  He handed them to me and sincerely apologized for the initial chicken exclusion.

Had the \"Riga Tony\" which was heavy but the smallest portion sized dish at our table, friends had the \"Dark Alfraid O\", cheese pizza, and Bollo Pasta, all of which they enjoyed.  Bellinis were great as always, and the pinot grigio was  smooth.  The reason I gave it 4 stars outta 5 is the wait is terribly long (you have to go during lunch or non peak hours).  We arrived at 7pm didn't get seated until 8pm and finished up at 9pm.  If you have the time then it's worth the wait.",

I completely understand it was Christmas Eve, but there was no positing of any special hours due to the holiday. Everything was fine until my boyfriends dad tried to get another bowl for his bottomless pasta and were told the kitchen was closed for the night. We were all taken back because we were not told of the time the kitchen was closing nor did our waitress check in to see if we wanted anything before the kitchen closed. He paid full price for one bowl of pasta and left hungry. Towards the end we started to feel rushed as the waitress kept coming by asking if needed any to go boxes to speed up the process. We had 6 people in our group and food took about 45 minutes from the time we placed it to the time we ate. When we were leaving and passed by employees not one said \"have a nice night\" \"thanks for coming in\" etc. Normally I love Oreganos, but was highly disappointed by this locations service.",

On peak hours, they do have long wait times but I don't think we've ever waited more than 40 minutes for a table at this location.  If there's a lot of people waiting...  they bring out samplers of pizza for everyone to try.  Comfortable seating inside... and oudoor seating available too.  They have watermisters on, on hot days.    Parking is tricky at this location but after your first visit, it's not that big of an issue unless their packed.    Large servings for all their plates.  Chicken wings are soooooo spicy.  It's legit!  Their pasta dishes are delicious and not two entrees are alike.  Pizza is by far THE BEST on their Menu!

I have been a customer of this establishment for over 10 years, and have been receiving poor service from every location.  It's too bad that the service is so bad, because this place has the potential of being one of the best in town. The poor service and poor managing is a reflection of the ownership.  I know I am not the only one who feels this way.  Mr. Mark please, please, please change your ways, or retire so we can enjoy the great food that keeps you in busness.",

    "text": "The food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths.   First of all, I'm no diva and do my best to be nice to people and not sweat the small stuff. I've been a manager and know how tough this kind of work can be. That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable.   Upon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back. While I was waiting I overheard a surly exchange between the hostess and customer.   \"What's the difference between this bar and the one inside?\" Answer: \"This one is outside and that one is inside\" Seeing the realization on her face that she was being rude, she \"politely\" added that the one outside had a different bartender too.  \"What time do you close?\" Answer: Basically a lot of complaining about customers coming in late which was code for \"I hate staying late\". Really not cool. Really bad for business.   Anywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!  Enter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see.   It took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant. Apparently they've fired two managers recently and are going to clean house some more.   Seriously. Keep your business inside your back room. I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax. Customer service here needs a kick in the pants!  PS: Tell your people to stop yelling at customers on the way out to \"have a great night, thanks\" because it is so insincere that it is worse than saying nothing at all.",

Not even an offer to remake the salad.  Those people just don't care.  Management needs a lesson in customer service. Will never return.",

This is the first time in years I've been given a cold side plate for my salad. . he's he was considerate enough to bring a cold side plate... how many times can you count thata server has done that?  Zac was cordial considerate and still like a ghost when he had to be..example, My drinks for me and my friends were refilled and I didn't even see him do it.haha nice very nice...

The best part was with the reasonable prices even with 20 adults we didn't have to break the bank. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love many items here but my favorite is the Italian stuffed grinder. (Or sub sandwich as I guess some people call it)... and a must have is their pizza cookie.  The only downside is their parking situation. Be prepared to park and walk since their actual parking lot fills up fast.",

    "text": "I have been to Oregano's at least once a week for the past two months (since I moved to the Phoenix area). I have never had an issue finding parking, and since I do not mind the heat, I have never had to wait to get a seat (ample patio seating - if you do not mind friendly pigeons). The pastas and salads have been consistently tasty. For starters, I recommend a small Simple House Salad - it is plenty to split between two people.  Last night the Wings of Fire (medium) were not up to par. Previous orders of the wings have been outstanding, but last night was quite a disappointment. The sauce seemed different (runnier), the wings were small, and there was a rubbery texture on a few of them. I am hoping that it was just an off night for the quality of the wings and will be trying them one more time. Also, if you are a fan of the taste of calamari and traditional preparation of it, do not order the Bistro Calamari. The fried coating was way too thick and took away from the texture and taste of the calamari.   Back to the positives! The Brussels Sprouts are delicious (note that they take about 20 minutes to cook). Both the Alfredo the Dark and the Big Rig Pasta (with meatballs) are delightful. They have a slight spice to them and the pasta is cooked perfectly (to my standards at least). The bread that accompanies the pastas adds a nice touch to the meal.   If you have room, I suggest ending your meal with The Original Pizza Cookie - Chocolate Chip! My only complaint is that there is not an option of regular peanut butter flavor. Ask for a refill of your beverage in a to-go cup, it is refreshing for the drive home.  Of course I suggest trying Oregano's! :)",

If you go during lunch you can get pizza and a drink for a pretty good price. Their pizza is pretty tasty too.  Don't like pizza, they also have pasta. The big rig pasta which is one of my farovites.

It wasn't too expensive either, $30 or so for two 14 inchers and a large Cesar salad. We got a Hawaiian and a simple peperoni. Both were tasty, not out of this world, but good. The Cesar was very good, love the dressing.   We also had a cocktail while we waited for our order. It was a little difficult to get a drink, the bar was packed so we flagged down a waitress to take our order, took a few minutes, but finally we got our drinks. I got a Bellini, looked amazing! tasted good too, but it was strong so I couldn't finish it, as our food arrived a few moments later.   In the past I remember them having great salads and very yummy aps, like the BOMB dip and cheese bread, a few walked by us and I seriously regretted not order them to go as well.   A few tips, if you are going for dinner get there with time to spare and have a cocktail on the patio while you wait for your table, they pretty much always have a wait, but the misting system out there is nice. Also, the cookie dessert is amaze-ballz! Get one for sure! Order it early though, it takes awhile to make.",

    "text": "Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!  But the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!  This self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \"Chicago thin crust\".  Wall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.  On the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance.",

It is an Arizona chain, and therefore not as bad as other national chains.  So, I'm going to go ahead and be honest and say that I love it!  My favorite favorite favorite thing is the Pablo Picasso salad.  It is so yummy.  It has fabulous tortilla strips, seasoned chicken and a delicious dressing.  I am not a salad girl but could most definitely order just this salad for my meal.  My roomie and I usually go too far and are so excited about the salad that we end up ordering the Chicago Deep Dish Pablo Picasso.  It is yummy but a bit much.  I usually end up eating a piece and taking the rest as left-overs (which isn't a bad thing).    Like some other reviewers, I also enjoy the VERY large glass of water that they give you.  Just one of those small things that gets me.  The outdoor patio is quite nice and the servers are usually very friendly.  It is a good place for big groups, although they won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  Yum- Pablo Picasso!",

    "text": "I know, it's a chain. But damnit sometimes you just like the food/drink at a chain restaurant. And ya know what, honesty is just more important sometimes than the pretentious -- i would NEVER even glance at a chain restaurant -- crap that I hear a lot of people spout. Don't get me wrong I'm a Local First girl. If given a choice I'll always go local...but every now and then you see something you like it and you give it a nod from time to time...  so anyways...guilt complex aside...this was one of the first restaurants i ate at when i arrived to phoenix. some co-workers were grabbing dinner there one weeknight after work and invited me to come. So I did. And I've been back once (fairly recently and for lunch) since.  Both times, I did the typical chain thing and ordered the same thing. The Pablo Picasso Salad. It's large. I mean huge doesn't even begin to describe it. But it's good. I order it with light cheese and dressing on the side. I also had a pizzookie here the first time I went...delish. I mean it's essentially partial-raw cookie dough...lightly baked in the oven (so it still retains the rawness to an extent) and ice cream on top. What is not to like!?  But in the name of full/shameful-disclosure...I will say my favorite thing about Oreganos are that they bring me a HUGE (again not suffice) glass of water and a HUGE glass of iced tea.   Oreganos = chain, but good, large portions, big drinks...what else could any shameful-sporadically-consumerist-americana ask for?",

The staff is extremely fun and nice, which is hard to come by these days.  The food is awesome. gigantic portions, but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day (or two...). The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie). This brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level.   The only downside... Its size, but that is part of their schtick. Get there early, whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time. Trust me though, it is well worth it. Oh and parking sucks too. Again the food and service are worth it the inconvenience.  **All the locations are great, the mesa one (one of the newest locations) is probably the worst, but I say that with a grain of salt. It is still better than most of the restaurants out there.",

Try the Boom Dip (Spinach Artichoke Cheese Dip) and tell me otherwise. The Meatball Sandwich? Takes a couple of days to eat it all. Delicious pizzas, salads bigger than your freakin' HEAD. You can't really go wrong. If you order one of their Cosmopolitans, bear in mind that they will only serve you 2 due to their potent nature. (I'm not sure if this is some sort of Urban Myth, but I heard it from this guy that my friend knows)  As illustrated in my little playlet above, the only bad thing I can say about Oregano's is that the parking situation... how to put this kindly... sucks. Tow away signs from neighboring businesses abound. The last time I went, I literally had to park 2 blocks north of the restaurant and hoof it for a while. At least I had some sort of activity to work up my appetite.  If you go on the weekends, prepare for about an hour wait during dinner hours. You may also want to arrange for a shuttle to and from your vehicle, wherever you may wind up parking.  *This may or may not have actually happened.",

    "text": "This review is based entirely on a stuffed Chicago-style pizza that we got to go.    It was DELICIOUS.  I can honestly say I can't wait to order it again.  When we called, we were given a time an hour and a half later to come pick it up.  This is not the place to go if you are in a hurry.  I'm pretty into the whole Slow Food thing, so I don't mind waiting.  I know that good food takes time.  Hell, Chicago-style pizza should take at least 45 minutes, if it's done right.  If you know it's going to take awhile, it's easy to mentally prepare for it.  Now, if I was absolutely starving and went to this place not knowing about the notorious wait...then I might have a problem.  I liked what I saw when we went to pick it up.. the interior is cozy and fun.  The patio was hoppin', and they have an outdoor bar.  Some guy was going around with little pieces of fresh, hot pizza to tide everyone over.  WARNING:  It may look like cheese but it's not...at least not when we were there.  I am a pretty strict vegetarian but had to laugh when I ate it and discovered there was pepperoni underneath the cheese.  Next time, I'll be sure to ask.  :)",

The pizza is passable but not a million miles from a toasted lavash cracker, the beer is all right, and the pizza cookie is pretty good (it's basically a cookie half-baked in a deep-dish pizza pan).   The problem with Oregano's is that it's something of a victim of its own success. They don't accept reservations no matter what the occasion, and there's almost always a wait. I've yet to figure out why, because it's really not all that. Unfortunately, I have friends who like it, and my polite requests to go elsewhere aren't always properly considered.  Oregano's relies on gimmicks--swing music, gigantic menus that are awkward to hold, and cutesy names for the pizzas. Sports fans take note: There is no cable TV.  When I  politely asked if they could turn on the Suns game (this was playoffs time, mind you), I was sternly told that Oregano's is not a sports bar. God forbid anything should distract customers from the frighteningly chirpy wait staff.   So after waiting a good long while to be seated, expect to be led through a gauntlet of manufactured greetings and well-wishing on the way to your table. If you're particularly unlucky, you may be served by the effeminate robotic waiter who avoids eye contact--he manages to be chirpy and rude at the same time, the worst of both worlds. I think he's worked there for a long time. If you veer off script, his head just might explode.  I'm just too damn cranky for this overrated pizza joint, I'm afraid.",

Because i loved the dessert so much, let's start with that!  Of course, as it's been mentioned before, dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok, really I'd probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy, huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same, don't know which one) all were pleasant, nice, helpful. I really don't know that I've ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the O'Riva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza i've ever had, but would i go back, definitley, would i order the same pizza, you bet. Would i try something else though, yep.   Great atmosphere, great employees, great food.  Oh, can't believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink, just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.",

To her credit (very nice) the waitress indicated drinks were taking longer than usual, but 20 minutes for a drink is a bit much. I order the turkey stuffed which is normally enough for 2 people and this one was about half of a half. Very disappointed.

I usually order Togo and last time I went I ordered a spaghetti with meat sauce which I asked for extra meat sauce on the side  and upon arriving to pick it up and I asked again if it was there and the girl at the counter said it was already tossed in.  When I got home and opened the dish there wasn't even enough sauce to cover the spaghetti.  I then drove back to the restaurant and the manager apologized and gave me more meat sauce,  a cookie cake and a gift card for my trouble. Fine. Then today I ordered a Pablo Picasso salad and a small thin crust pizza at 7, waited 6 minutes on the phone to place the order and they said it would take 35 minutes to prepare.  I arrived at 7:50 thinking it would be ready at the counter and after I paid the cashier said he would go check on it and came back to say it would be a few more minutes.  The pizza came out and then I heard the expo say to the cashier  they didn't have the salad and it would be a few more minutes.  I didn't receive the full order till about 8:10 which was over an hour after I placed the order.  Granted the place was busy but there's no reason why it took that long to receive my order after I called ahead.

The reason I went back was because I had the gift card so don't know if I will return at least to this location.",

    "text": "Wait wasn't too bad. But after that it wasn't good at all. First off came here for my daughters birthday with a couple of her friends. So 5 total in our party. We were seated and our drink order was taken right away. Should be a good sign right? Nope. I'm pretty sure they went to the Pepsi distribution center to pick up our drinks. Finally got our drinks and placed our order. A few of us finished our drinks as most people do while waiting for the food to come. Our waitress walked by 2 times. Finally on our third time we stopped her and she made it very clear we inconvenienced her. Asked for refills and politely informed her that none of us had silverware. I did so in anticipation of our food coming and not wanting to wait for silverware. She informed us they were out of plates cups and silverware! What the holy fresh hell is that?!? How does a restaurant run out of plates silverware and cups?!? Anyway, our food finally comes and low and behold... NO SILVERWARE!! Ask yet again for silverware and she brings 4 sets of silverware. Please note: there are 5 of us as previously stated. Never once again got asked if we would like refills. Only had 2 drinks the entire time we sat here waiting for the dishes to be washed apparently. Management needs to be washed out. Horrible horrible horrible experience. Pregnant wife is miserable. Daughters birthday is horrendous. And the only thing anyone here wanted was the pizza cookie and God forbid that actually come out, we probably won't get spoons either!! Ugh...  Update for all who have invested their time reading this novel the saga continues. After 20 min of not seeing the waitress I go and find a manager. I try telling him what's going on and he rushes me to my point and completely ignores 3/4 of what I'm saying. He says \"so you just want your cookie?\" The guy is clearly on some sort of uppers and is flying 100mph. Goes charging towards my daughter and asks her what kind of cookie she wants. Literally scares the sh*t out of an 11 year old. Another ten minutes goes by and the waitress comes out and says so you guys want a cookie?? No. We don't want your damn attitude!! Unbelievable!! No hospitality in the hospitality industry anymore I guess. Good luck to all who venture to this establishment",

    "text": "I've been going to Oregano's for several years and went the other night although I hadn't been in a very long time. When I first started going here, I would get the Italian Wedding Soup. They used to give you a large meatball with each refill, but then they got cheap and wouldn't do that anymore. The reason I haven't been here in a long time is because the management went to this totally bizarre method of scheduling take out orders for like 2 hours after you call in. It was totally ridiculous! The other night, they gave me a time of 20 minutes, so either I hit them on a good day or they got rid of that ridiculous policy. What I most typically order is the Meatball Sandwich, which is what I had the other night. The sandwich was very tasty as usual. I noticed they made the sandwich smaller. Only 3 meatballs, when they used to do four. I was actually okay with this. When I first started ordering this, it came with waffle fries, which were pretty good. Now, it comes with these potato things. I say things, because I'm not sure what they were supposed to be. They kind of had the appearance of chips, but were very dark. They weren't crunchy like chips and were just okay to me. I would have rather had the waffle fries or a tasty Italian salad of some kind. I DO like the food here, so I would probably have given them 5 stars except for the change in the soup policy, the bizarre scheduling, and the weird potatos.",

So when i hit AZ for Comic Con this was a must try.   We started with the garlic parm lime wings which were cooked nicely and seasoned perfectly. they were fantastic. The lime added that extra lil zing to garlic parm that I haven't had before.   Then I had the Italian Wedding Soup which came in a bread bowl (i think it was pizza dough shaped as the bowl). It was perfection, the seasoning, the balance, the ingredients.   Then the main course, the stuffed pizza. A deepdish pizza topped by a thin crust top and the sauce ontop of that. It was PERFECTION. So much cheese and so filled with pepperoni. The crust had a nice crunch to it and the flavor of the dough was perfect to me.  Oregano's is now a must hit joint for me anytime I end up in Phoenix or near Phoenix. Go check it out you will not be disappointed.",

It seems like there is a lot of work put into gathering all of the wall decorations. The decorations remind me of something I would expect to see at a TGIF or a Buca di Beppo, another Italian chain.  The appetizers we enjoyed all were very good. I would recommend the bruschetta, cheesy bread, and wings. The service on getting us our drinks was very slow and the beer was not very good. The pizza itself was better than most pizza I have here in the valley.

I ordered the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain (you know all the yellow bits no one wants to eat) with a few soggy croutons and cucumbers. I ate less that a 14 of it.

Not a super huge lover of Italian, but this place may end up being a prime mover in changing my mind.  Grabbed a pretty late dinner with a few high school friends I hadn't seen in a while, and we had the place virtually to ourselves. Parsing through the menu, I could hear my mom's almost manic raving about their pizzas and quickly decided to go the way of pasta (sorry, mom). I shamelessly love quirky campy menu listings, so I was super pleased with the Alfredo the Dark for the quick chuckle and the spot-on quality. The kick of poblano went a long way in cementing this as easily one of my favorite pasta dishes in Phoenix. Chased this all down with a Manhattan and a heaping helping of Pizzookie.  Super solid meal overall. Finally starting to understand the rave reviews. Maybe next time I'll actually grab a slice.",

The patio is great - it's huge - but the interior is comfortable and has a large floor plan with lots of nooks for cozy dining.  I can't think of a better compliment to give this place than saying if I had friends in town, I'd take them to Oregano's before I took them to the yuppie places downtown, and I say that being very self-aware in my yuppie-ness. The pizza's classic and plenty tasty, the atmosphere is more comfortable, and best of all you feel like you're in Phoenix and not a hipster/tourist trap.",

My pasta (Alfredo the dark) was a nice lunch portion but slightly dry with not enough sauce, not flavorful.

He was fast with your drinks, orders.  He made suggestions as we were undecided on what we wanted.  He evenn put on all the fans and evap cooler for us as the sun was beating down even with the umbrellas.  Hey Oreganoes, why not put up the canopy that you were supposed to?  My only beef.    The food is absolutely awesome!!  But I think you already knew that!  The crust cracker thin, the toppings delicious.  The salads (antipasto and Idon't remember the name of the other one.  The wings were also fantastic, the honey bbq and the garlic parmesan.  Fantastic.  Why our waiter even, without asking, brought us all large to go cups of what we were drinking!  Absolutely the best!  I will be back.",

We shared a side of the meatballs and a Julius Caesar salad...honestly, I was already full after all of that!  I ordered the big rig pasta and my husband ordered the El Diablo shrimp pasta...the portions were huge, so I ended up taking home well over half of my entree.

    "text": "I have never been disappointed at Oregano's. My friend and I were going there about once a month for a year and a half while we were in school. I had never been here so she introduced me. I have now been there several times and this is my favorite of the locations. The tasters I've tried are the toasted ravioli espaniol, boom dip, guaca tony, and Lawrence's stuffed mushrooms.  The ravioli is divine with a nice kick in the cheese and the marinara is my favorite of all of the the marinaras I have tasted.  The boom dip is rich and creamy and the chips are actually a thin crust pizza with cheese on top, there are no words to describe how absolutely wonderful it is.  The guaca tony has the same thin crust pizza to smear guac on and from what I hear the guac is phenomenal, stupid allergies prohibit me tasting.  The stuffed mushrooms are more of a meal than a taster and are a lot meatier than I had imagined but was rich and delicious.  If you get tasters just know that they are huge and that if you plan on dessert it is important to have plenty of people to share with unless you plan on not eating lunch/dinner.  In regards to the wings my husband has thoroughly enjoyed the wings of fire and says that they are a different kind of hot more black pepper than hot sauce hot.  He says that they were surprising but that they were a good change.   The salads are like everything else on the menu huge and a little different.  The Julius Caesar has a dressing that is Caesar with a little bit of a different kick.  I normally ask for extra dressing but there was flavor in every bite.  When you add chicken it is finally sliced and you can never get a bite without the chicken, I usually share this with my daughter because it is just to big for one person.  My husband has said that the big beefstro and the antipasto thing are both the best salads he has ever had.  This is high praise since he tends to not like going out.  Every time we have gone out since he compares every salad he comes in contact with the salads from Oregano's and so his taste for other salads has become ruined.  My father-in-law says that the southwestern shrimp caesar is better than he ever imagined.  The shrimp was so tasty that even I liked it and my daughter started trying to steal salad.   We have tried two of the sandwiches sort of on accident.  The Italian stuffed and the fresh grilled Italian sausage.  My mother-in-law meant to order the fresh grilled Italian sausage but accidentally said the Italian stuffed and when it came out she said it was delicious but that she wanted the sausage and mentioned it to the waitress.  The waitress reordered the sausage sandwich and wrapped it up for her to take home and didn't even charge us for it.  I think this really says something about the level of customer service that I have seen every time we go.  We all tasted both and my mother-in-law who is rarely impressed has suggested this place numerous times based on this, oh and dessert.  The pizzas are great. I normally don't like the thin crust but feel that they pack a lot in. I read in a review that the Aunt Margarita had no flavor which I thought was odd. It definitely isn't as greasy as some of the pizzas but it has some darn good flavor. The tomatoes are always done just right to give you that juicy tomato quality. My daughter always gets the pasta with the pesto sauce.  She loves the pesto and enjoys the pesto penne bake.  I truly love the ziti since it is flavorful and huge enough for three meals.  I don't really like their Alfredo the dark but it isn't the worst alfredo that I have had.   For dessert I have only ever had their pizza cookie and don't see any reason to change this in the future.  I have had pizza cookie at many places but non that are even close to as yummy as the ones her at Oregano's.   You will definitely find me at an Oregano's again soon.",

There is a large patio, surrounded by (woefully inadequate amounts of) parking.  You can almost always expect a touch of waiting.

The floor wasn't clean and you didn't even need to look at it, the way your foot stuck to the ground was the enough for you to know.The people that came after us received there food before us. 50 minutes later we finally got our food. Our server was being nice but his tone made it noticeable that it was all sarcasm. When the food came out the guacamole looked unappetizing; coloring was a dead giveaway that it wasn't going to cut it. When asked to have a new batch, they just gave us a side of avocado to mix in and by then the pizza was cold.  I had ordered a salad and you would assume that the dressing came with it. It did not!! I was charged .29 cents for ranch! It was awkward to ask of any other assistance without it seeming bothersome. Overall a complete waste of money.",

It took forever for our appetizer to come out,  tables that were seated and ordered after we did, got their apps before us.   When our appetizer the boom dip came out we were given two small plates and the silverware.   Dip was good, artichokes were a little tough.   Our pizza finally arrived and we had to use the same plates that we had put our dip on.  Keep in mind that this whole time our waitress never returned to the table,  the appetizer and our pizza was brought by someone else.  We finally got her attention when she came to get the drink order or the next table,  and asked for napkins.   We had to wait several minutes for her to bring them to us,  and when she did she only brought us one each.   We continued to eat and my husband ran out of Pepsi, completely.   We waited,  and waited,  and waited.   Finally he got up and refilled his own drink, walking behind the bar to do so,  which our waitress saw him do.   We finished eating and we waited,  and waited,  and waited. ...again.   Finally we flagged down another employee who was walking by and asked for a box and our check.   Our waitress finally brought the check and I had to ask her for a box as well.  If she had acknowledged the fact that my hubby had to help himself in order to get a refill,  that I was out of my drink,  and that her performance with us had been less than satisfactory, I wouldn't be writing this right now.  We know people have bad days,  get busy,  etc and we don't expect perfection but a little concern would have been nice.  It takes a lot for me to leave a bad review especially based on the wait staff bc I waited tables for years,  but I really think it is called for tonight.   A simple I'm sorry I dropped the ball with you guys would have gone a long way.",

Literally the only time..   So they tell us that we can sit outside with the heat lamps and be seated right away.  We opt for the lamps and are seated.   Our waiter comes over and takes our drink orders and quickly returns with almost all the drinks.. he forgets our friends drink and when we mention it.. he scatters away and returns about 4min later with the drink.  By this time we order some wings and salads and the pizzas.    While waiting for our food, we notice our heat lamp above us is not on, and ask to have it turned on.  they come over and do it.  For some reason I notice that our waiter is no where to be found.  I start seeing other people filling our drinks, giving napkins, cheese, etc.  Oh well.. multi-tasking I guess.  So our food arrives via our waiter and he begins serving with an apology.. he put the olives that were supposed to be on the side.. ON the pizza.  One of our bunch is allergic to olives.. yeah..  So he brings out the stuffed pizza and we begin to work on that and the few start eating the olive pizza.  They keep saying sorry and will be bringing out the cheese pizza with olives on the side.  I swear it seemed like 30 more minutes before we saw someone with the pizza.  Within those minutes, our waiter vanished again, only to be seen in small  blips across the back of our minds.  Finally.. the pizza arrives and while we're all mostly done, our friend gets to start eating.   The manager is very kind to take to not charge for the extra pizza of course, but to make things even better, he throws in a pizza cookie.  it was our friends birthday, so that's two cookies we get.. yummy.  So we're all finished, and it's time to wait for our bill.  (checks watch). Oh there he is finally..  he drops the bill off and I ask him for change for a $100 bill..  he leaves.  (checks watch).  \"Wow, did he just leave??\"  At one point I see him come back about 10 minutes later and serve another table a drink and I notice the 100 in his hand.. lol . Wow.. Finally he goes back to get me change.    By now we're all ready to leave and we start to split the bill up.. here's the best part.  Our bill came out to around $77 and change and a friend throws in the tip, another throws in $20.. What do I do because Im not paying attention and my mind is all over?  I shell out 77 in cash (along with everyone elses money) and say \"20 on the card and the rest is yours.\"    ... I wonder why he was so nice when he came back with the card.    I guess I would be to if I got a $32.00 tip...    You would think he would have caught that.    I think this is the most of said on any of my reviews.  Will I go here again? Of course I will.  I live in Glendale and unfortunately, until they build one in Glendale, this is the closest one..  I prefer the Tempe location.",

It was salty and you could barely taste the marinara sauce and it was waaaay waaaay over priced!!! They put a whole sausage patty on bottom and the dough is hard on bottom....disgusting!!! Not only that but our bill was like 60.00 dollars but we also waited about 45 minutes....so the only things that were good were the wings and the blue moon. I should of went to little caesars lol...",

    "text": "Oregano's does so much right with their pizza and sauces that it was difficult not to give them five stars, but I am trying keep it real here there are a lot of really good pizza joints in the Phoenix area. Honestly though I think I can rate them higher on their wings than on the pizza, not many places can get just the right amount of crispy and just the right amount of meaty when it comes to chicken wings and for my taste these guys nail it. I give the wings 5 stars hands down I will put Oregano's up against anyone in town for chicken wings. I have tried multiple locations and they are consistent at all three that I have tried. The only thing that is frustrating is that they are always busy and the situation to get a table can be a bit irritating when you have been waiting all week for cheat day...and speaking of cheat day the pizzookie or whatever it is called is super good as well if you are in the mood to pack on about 2500 calories in one meal these guys are one of the best places to blow a clean eating streak.",

I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever.  I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well.  Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie!  Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10\" pan and about 1/2\" thick is so flavorful and good.  I almost got sick from eating to much.  Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy.  I cant think of a better consistent trendy place for great food and great service.  It's most definitely as good as it gets!",

Pzookie is a huge chocolate chip cookie in a cast iron dish served warm with ice cream on it. UM Yeah, its freakin delicious. Anyway the beefstro salad is awesome. Normally i don't care for steak in a salad but this is very thinly sliced rib eye and its so good, and big enough for 2-3 to share. The wings are really good and they are all drum stick wings and three kinds of sauces. The original is best. The Italian wedding soup with a meat ball is so tasty. The Big Ravioli is really good and stuffed with lots or cheese meat and topped with marinara sauce. But the Chicago Style deep dish pizza is awesome. Its huge very filling so don't order unless your with a group of people. It takes about 30 minutes to make but its so worth it. Just remember to save room for the pzookie. Even if you are stuffed order the pzookie cause when you see it and try it you will finish it!!!",

So we often do half and half to make everybody happy...and we've never ran into this situation, they wanted to charge as if the whole pizza had all the toppings...meaning if you get 3 toppings on one side and 3 different toppings on the other side, you better be prepared to pay for a 6 topping pizza...about $8 extra.  So they are off the 'family friendly' list for me.",

The crust is usually burnt just a enough to get the flavor and its always delicious.  My wife loves the macadamia cookie and ice cream dessert.  Its one of her favorites as well.  I also am a fan of their bellini.  While you wait you can try one and relax for a while.  For solid wings, pizza, dessert, drinks, and even the price you cant go wrong with any of the Oreganos locations.  Even that large party of 10 we had the bill was pretty close to a hundred.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant in Phoenix, period.  We love eating here and we've got it down to a science.  Here's your gameplan for a fantastic Oregano's experience in under 90 minutes.  Print it out and take it with you (yes, you can laminate it if you want).  INSIDER'S GUIDE TO OREGANO'S:  1) Make plans for dinner (lunch is an impossibility unless you have two-hour lunch breaks ... you lucky dog).  2) Get some fun friends together (Oregano's is great in groups of about six - keeps all seating options open)  3) Grab a deck of cards or two (you'll see)  4) Get the whole group to show up at 6 (they won't put your name on the list unless you're all there)  5) Hang out and talk or play cards with your friends for forty minutes or so (now you see why they need to be FUN friends)  6) About 20 minutes before your scheduled seating, order two things: DEEP DISH PIZZA and GUACA-TONY.  These both take a while but the waitstaff will put the order in and have it cook while you wait.  7) After you get seated and get drinks, put in any SALAD OR ENTREE orders.  As you do, the guaca-tony will show up right on cue.  Your friends will admire both your foresight and your appetizer selection.  It's an amazing Italian guacamole with a thin-crust pizza for dipping.  Unforgettable, as Old Blue-eyes would say.  8) The guaca-tony will be mostly gone in a hurry, so have the obligatory \"no, you take the last slice\" discussion, and reluctantly gobble down the rest of it (way to take one for the team, champ).  Just as the pan is cleared, here comes the pizza and other entrees.  Perfect!  But don't let that waiter escape - order your PIZZOOKIES now! (ideally chocolate chip, but I won't judge if you go for peanut butter or white chocolate macadamia nut).  9) Devour the pizza.  Their deep dish is so very good.  It's extremely filling, so it's best to calculate about 1-2 slices per person.  Don't worry, it's tasty reheated.  10) Just when you decide you can't eat another bite, the pizzookies show up ... and, well, you might as well have a little.  Generous scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of a half-baked cookie in a pizza pan, and drizzed with chocolate syrup.  The best.  11) Grab the check.  Your friends will think you are very generous, but it turns out eating at Oregano's is really affordable in groups, since you split most things.  Without alcohol, it usually works out to about $10 per person, including tax and tip.  Of course, you can just ask everyone for the 10 bucks or, if you're feeling unscrupulous, ask them all for 15 bucks.  For the awesome meal they just had, they'll probably pay it!",

Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad. was sent from heaven, one thing. I haven't actually had it since I became vegetarian a couple months ago, but the salad without chicken would not be a miss!! You may be curious to know why we haven't been here in so long, well just ONCE we saw a cockroach on the wall that grossed us out, and that's why this place loses a star. Other than that, I recommend it without a doubt. Thin crust pizza is way better than the deep dish here!",

    "text": "Okay here it goes..while their food remains consistently delicious.. their service leaves a LOT to be desired. This issue is with the bartenders. A group of us showed  up for a birthday dinner. The regular wait was an hour.. for us (party of 11) was 1 1/2. My friend Carlos and I walked  up to the outside bar and no bartender to be found.. ok? No problem..inside we went. Okay so we approach the inside bar. We stand there and are unnoticed  by the 3 people behind the bar. Finally a woman greets us..imagine Janis Joplin and Joan Jett having a love child and now she's in her 40's..She takes my order a single Amstel Light...she takes Carlos' order.. 2 drinks. She cards us.. I show her my id and he shows his. She explains she needs to see and card the person he is buying the drink for. Okay that's a pain.. but fine. So what does she do. She leaves me at the bar while she goes with Carlos out to the crowded patio to card his wife.. really? How about you take care of me since I have met all the requirements? okay? so while she is gone..another bartender comes up and takes my order. As he is about to grab me a beer Janice Jett returns and says something to him he looks at me and I say the beer is for me Im on my own tab he turns back and he walks away?? WTF? What does it take to get a friggin' beer. So Janice Jett gives Carlos 2 drinks then I finally get mine and what does she do? She puts it all on Carlos' tab? Are you freakin kidding me? Janice Jett you are the WORST bartender ever. You did nothing right in this transaction. Needless to say we ended up with her as our server.. Murphy's Law..and she tried to card me again! I clued her in that she had done it just 20 minutes ago and her memory kicked in. Then we ask for more drinks. Half the table received theirs..and she made the rest of us wait as she doled out waters. Waters are great but we ordered beer..give us what we ordered! THEN give us waters..Ive never been so frustrated or irritated. It was almost laughable. Needless to say I didnt bother to order any more drinks after that.. what's the point..I wouldnt get it in a timely fashion anyway.",

The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it. Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch. Large patio area is a perfect place to eat most of the year. My go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad, the Numero One-O on thin crust, and a peanut butter pizza cookie.",

    "text": "I Love Oregano's and can't believe I have never written a review. This is my regular place. The best thing about Oregano's is the Bellini's and the staff. The food is pretty good and is a good value. Usually order the Pablo Picaso Salad (amazing) and the Alfredo the Dark Pasta with Shredded Chicken. The toasted Ravioli apps are yummy. This place is always busy, so expect a wait even during the week. The best time to come is after 9pm in my opinion. I have seen the wait as long as two hours, no joke. They don't take reservations and all the party has to be there for them to list you. Choose inside, outside or first available. You can order a drink and even apps for the wait. This is basically a bar that sells food so leave the kiddos at home. They will not enjoy it here, you will not enjoy it here with them and everyone else will not enjoy it so take them to McDonalds and leave them with a sitter. You deserve a night out anyway.  The Pizza Cookie is really good. I like Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter. The servers here really work their buts off. They will do most anything to make your meal here a great one. They even chit chat with you if you like and make you feel special. I never tip under 20% here and feel I get my money's worth every time.   They seem to have been turning over help more in the past couple of years. They have a solid business and I attribute that to their growth, but for the most part the employees seem to like working there.  My only real beef aside from the wait is there are only two bathrooms. One Male and one Female. As many customers as this place has they need to figure a way to add dividers and make it so more can use as there is always a line. The parking is not a big deal to me. They have a small lot, but there is PLENTY of street parking nearby and if there is not, then you need to come back at a different time because the wait will be a killer.",

Must have fantastic service and ambience?! No. No. And no. Most of the staff is definitely professional, speedy and fun. My take out gal the other day \"scolded\" me for arriving too early.  \"I said 25 minutes...whyd you get here too early?\" \"To spend time with you, you prickly ass pear\" Anyway I hung out and waited my full alloted time. No biggie. I ordered 3 apps and 1 medium pizza.  \"That'll be $47 dollars please.\" says miss prickly ass pear. I  arrive home to my $22 medium BBQ pizza. Thin crust. Nice sauce. Tastey all around. The stuffed mushrooms. Not so great. More salt then Salt Lake City. And at least a pound of crumbled Italian sausage. Portabellos were too slimy. Like bad canned fruit. Garlic cheese bread...well, come on how can you screw that up. My dog can make garlice bread (and it's not bad by the way).  All in all. I'd rather get take out than sit inside at this location. Not a big fan of the cluttered look. There are pictures and knick knack crap everywhere. It looks like an Italian flea market threw up everywhere!",

As I started to get out plates and silverware, he mentioned that paper plates, plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag.  Well, he sprung for dinner, I can clean a few plates, right?   HUGE portions!  He brought spaghetti with marinara.  It was angel hair.  I think there *could* have been more sauce.   The lasagna was their \"Italian Flag\" lasagna and really good!  Ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside.  The portion was enormous as well.  We both had a hunk and I had another one today for lunch.   Both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container.   The appetizer was something I'd never had before: Toasted Ravioli.  WTF???  Handmade ravioli, stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in.  There was definitely some kick to it, as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos. It was a very satisfying meal and I'm giving it three stars.  The portions were big, the prices were reasonable (looking at the website since he brought it to my place) and everything was full of flavor.     This was no Harley's meal, but for something quick and Italian, it wasn't half bad!  Of course, eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus!",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps, but I figured I should add my two cents.   I love Oreganos. When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza.   I enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza.   While some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal.",

Service was slow and unengaged, we had our salad before our drinks.  They treated us like nothing but a tip and a waste of their adolescent time.  Manager tried to smooth things over with a cookie, and over heard him doing it with the table right next to us! We were walking out the door, giving up on waiting for said cookie that now my 5 year old had his heart set on (THANKS waitress), when she magically discovered it was ready. Not to mention spent $75 for a &15 Little Caesar's meal.  Last time, I will never recommend this over priced McDonald's version of pizza that rides on their brand name instead of service and quality. There is way better ANYWHERE you go try, Maize's, St. Francis (great for kids), Postinos up the street or Pizza Bianco.",

I've tried a lot of pizza in my 27 years here as a Phoenix native, and this place probably has the best pizza in town. The Italian Gold wings are to die for, the kick butt garlic bread is unlike any garlic bread you'll find anywhere else, and the drinks and desserts are both unique and fantastic. Add a friendly, upbeat wait staff to these things, and you have a dining experience that will keep you coming back.

I love the pizookie so much that I will force my stomach to make room so I can put that deliciousness in my belly. I would probably eat 10 if I were given the opportunity.

I was told they will NOT put extra toppings on it cuz it already has alot and I REALLY DON'T NEED IT that way. I told him do it anyway, I'm paying extra for it. He refused. The ???manager??? said the same thing. I told her since their 2goof-ups I've always gotten it that way and i DON'T need them to tell me how I WANT my pizza. Then she said i guess we can this one time. I told her NO YOU CAN'T, we already ordered pizza from another place that actually cares about the customer. We will NOT be calling your place again. EVER !!!!!  Oregano's pizza listen up !!! You are here for us. We are not here for you to order around. Stop being so arrogant and thinking you are sooo much more important than your customers. Little miss NON-manager, you and your restaurant just got fired as our pizza provider. SHAME ON YOU !!!!!!!",

In the end our pan pizza was served as a thin crust. The dinner salad, though very large, was rather bland as well. My biggest disappointment though was with the service :-/ he truly had no personality and actually complained about having to serve us outside.",

We sat outside in the patio bar, chatted with our bartender, and sipped on belini's (a drink so strong that they are only allowed to sell 2 of them per drinker).  WOW!

My friend and I arrived promptly at 11 and was immediately greeted by every employee. We started with the sweet potato fries. They were good, but the aoili was a little spicy and didn't really go well with the fries. Of course the best sweet potato fires are at Delux, but these were pretty good for a pizza joint. I got the stuffed pizza lunch special. It was good, too, but nothing to write home about. Then we got the best part of the meal: dessert. We ordered the cookie pizza thingie. It was great, it came out warm and gooey with vanilla ice cream on top. Overall, this experience was far better then my last visit to Oregano's. Would I eat there again? probably.",

Given that I wasn't super hungry, I decided it was worth the wait to try (had a bad pizza craving today).  Ordered it with sausage.  When I picked it up, I was surprised how heavy it was (ordered a medium). It was definitely the heaviest pizza I've ever carried.  Now on to the pizza.  I was surprised how much I liked it:  the tomato sauce was really good and it also had loads of cheese. The sausage was overpowered by the sauce, but it was good.    Pomo is my favorite pizza place here, but, if you're in the mood for for a good 3000 calorie pizza that will feel like a load in your tummy, look no further.  This was well worth the calories!",

A server came rushing up to us to ask if anyone had helped us. We told him no and nobody had even acknowledged us. The server just offered a week apology and didn't try to retain us. On a Previous visit, there was an infestation of gnats hovering around the bar and side exit. We switched seats and ran into the same pests. The manager did offer a discount off of our meal.

I've always liked this particular pizza chain and this location is just like the others. They have all the similar do-dads hanging on the walls and the menu is gigantic.  Ordered my favorite Rib Eye Salad in the biggest size they have. They call it The Big Beefstro Salad on the menu and it is really good. The dressing has a sweet Serrano Pepper flavor going on and it is pretty spicy. This one was so big I had to bring some home for later.  My friends ordered the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and it was giant. They also were excited about the size and had to ask for a box for the leftovers as well.  Service was very friendly and we experienced several greetings. They even opened the doors as we both entered and left the building. We were surprised by the large amount of take out orders that were waiting for people to pick them up.  Looking forward to trying out some pizza again and possibly checking out their famous all Original Pizza Cookie with Ice Cream. Dang it looked scrumptious and would definitely ruin my girlish figure.

The excellent service we got from Chris and the rest of the staff combined with our food surpassing my expectations was enough for 5 stars.   We walk in and the first thing I hear is everyone greeting us which sets the mood for the remainder of our time there. Then Chris introduces himself and explains to us that the Chicago Deep Dish pizzas take about 45 minutes to come out and the Thin Crusts take 20. We didn't have the time to wait so we went for a Thin Crust 16\" pizza and a salad. He was super friendly and refills were on point. The salad we ordered was huge! There was enough to pair with the pizza and then enough for me and my girlfriend to take to work for lunch the next day. Our pizza, which half was topped the way my girlfriend wanted and the other half my way, was delicious and Christ sprinkled a generous amount of grated parmesan cheese which was great. There was also plenty of pizza left to take home.   To top it off we ordered Pizza Cookie which was a thick chocolate chip cookie baked in a 6\" pizza pan with not 2 but 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream. We have had many different variations of this dessert and the one from Oreganos has taken the #1 spot on our list.    The food would of easily just earned 4 stars alone but as we were leaving all the staff again wished us a good night and the superb customer service at this place adds another for the 5 star rating. We will be coming back when we have more free time for a Chicago deep dish and another Pizza Cookie!",

So I was hoping to expect the same service as I've always when I visited the Camelback restaurant. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be.   Firstly, the hostess had us waiting unnecessarily, stating that our our outside table was being prepared. That wasn't the case as they only had one customer in the patio. When I asked the hostess how long it will be, she probably realised the pointless wait and directed us to 1 of 6 free tables.   When we got to the table, it was dirty with specs of leftover pizza from the precious dining. Our waitress was not very helpful either when asked for recommending  vegetarian pizzas. The water which was brought to us was in filthy glasses and we had to send one of them back. The pizzas took more than 30 mins, which seemed a bit much for a couple of regular pizzas. We were told things are hectic between 3-5pm and that the oven was an old type which made things lesser efficient than the ones in Tempe.   When the pizza finally arrived, it was ok. But by then it didn't really matter.   So overall, pretty disappointed with the service. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant again!",

    "text": "This review is solely based on hostess service at Camelback/7st location.   We were so hungry  and craving pasta from Oregano's. Knowing that wait can be long, we called as we were  three minutes away to make sure the wait is not going to be 40 minutes.   The guy on the phone told me that they had several tables inside and few outside. We pulled in three minutes later and based of hostess greeting us, I should of known it will not go well.   She takes our name, barely greeting us and does not tell us about how long the wait will be at all. I see tables outside but she is not even going to check and see if they are available. Five minutes in, we change our outside table to inside one since at this point we are not getting seated.   She changes it without telling us again, how long the wait will be. At this point, I am super hungry and getting a little frustrated.   I finally ask another hosted who was cheat cheating there, how long will out wait be? She tells us 20 minutes! I was so mad at that point. Empty tables, which I can see with my eyes and after ten minutes of waiting they tell me, oh the wait will be 20 minutes. The place is clearly slow.   I know that sometimes they might not have enough chefs, servers....but please. This was such an awful experience. My time and money are imported to me as they are to everyone else and when somebody disrespects it-not good.   We walked away, as I was not ready to leave my money there after that treatment. So sad as I wanted the pasta and I always had good service at this Camelback Oregano's!   I recommend that hostess get some additional training on how to communicate, especially when you are working in the industry where hungry people are at your door at all times.",

They told me it wouldn't be ready until 9:45pm, no joke. Are you freaking kidding me? The waitress said it was because of their ordering system. I don't know their system but it seems like a terrible one if you have to wait over an hour for salads.",

    "text": "Go hungry! I've been to Oregano's twice now, and was served good, hearty Italian food. This place is great for groups of four or more, since almost everything is served family style.   The garlic bread appetizer (with cheese and marinara dipping sauce, of course) was a meal in itself! The Numero One salald offers a nice Mediterranean flare, and was tasty, but the lettuce didn't look really fresh. The pizza here was also good. Moving here from Chicago, they have a VERY thin \"thin crust\" that's cut in a waffle pattern, bringing a touch of the Windy City to the Valley. There is also deep dish and stuffed pizza listed on the menu, but haven't tried those for authenticity.... Haha.   It you desire good family style dinners on an empty stomach, you've found a good place.",

    "text": "We had lunch yesterday at Oregano at this location because it's close to where we live. The guy that greeted us at the front was very friendly & took us to a table. The waitress was just as great, however the food was not great. We ordered our drinks first, my companion an iced tea & me a hot tea. I was given a tea bag & a cup of hot water. The water was not hot enough. It's just marginally warm enough as hot tea. Then I ordered the 'bowl of pasta' with 2 meatballs. I wanted spaghetti but they only serve angel hair & fettuccine noodles. When the food came, the noodles were ok, but there was not much tomatoes sauce on the noodles. The meatballs looked like they just came  out of the microwave oven & just lukewarm. They are not even browned. I had to ask the waitress to reheat them. My question is: how come they don't serve spaghetti (for the 'Bowl of Pasta' )? Spaghetti should be very common in Italian restaurants. Also the sauce is pretty spicy. Maybe they want to do a little differently  from the traditional Italian restaurants, but maybe we could have the option of 'not spicy' in the tomato sauce. Next time I'll stick with other traditional Italian restaurants !",

She gave us a Salted Caramel Pizza Cookie. I am still in orbit! I can't wait to go back!",

I ate 1/2 of one and the rest of them are going in the trash! :/   I'm irritated and annoyed because whoever was in charge of the garlic bread should've known it was burnt and should have replaced it. I think that since it was a Carry  out they figured, the hell with it! Chances are they will not be returned to the kitchen!   If you are carry out I strongly  Recommend you check all of your food. Make sure you are not given burnt bread! :/",

The wings have been much better in the past but weren't nearly as meaty as I remember. I ordered a spicy shrimp pasta but subbed the protein for chicken and it was delicious!  I shared some of my sister in law's Pablo Picasso salad, which is just the best salad ever! My husband shared a thin crust pizza with his mom and it was very disappointing but the others at the table that ordered deep dish were very pleased with their order. For dessert we were treated to a pizza cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream (I ordered half and half peanut butter and chocolate chip). The service was good even though we had a large group and the prices were reasonable for the portions. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants but this is one of the better ones for sure.",

Even the staff in the kitchen thanked us as we were making our way out.  So why 4 stars? Unfortunately there was a server or waitress (not sure because she didn't service us nor anyone around us) that was hiding by a desktop where they input orders & she was snacking on who knows what without utensils! I don't think she was on her break because she was standing up, not at a table & trying to hide. Even after making eye contact with her, she continued her snacking. Big big no-no!!",

I was offered both the inside and outside and ultimately sat inside because I was told it has personality. It sure does! It's a very cute inside that makes you feel at home to a sense.   The food was SO good and the stuffed pizza is ridiculously amazing. We got sausage and cheese and took most of it home. One slice will fill you up if you also get an appetizer like we did. We had the Tony Guacamole pizza which is one of their signature ones. So good. A bit salty but that never has bothered me.   Overall - extremely pleased with my experience and hope to come back next time I'm in town! :)",

We had a party of 9 and called ahead and still waited 45 minutes for a table, then were seated outside under the heat lamps, so had to ask twice to get them turned off.  Finally got the orders taken, a few of our party had their orders in 10 or 15 minutes.  I ordered the big slice and a garden salad.  The salad arrived quick and was warm, it had obviously been out a while.  It took the pizza another 30 minutes to arrive, and I was getting ready to leave without it.  The pizza was pretty good but nothing spectacular.  The food was decent and I would eat it again, but the disorganized service needs some work, especially during lunch when people are on a time-limit.  There were 4 servers on the patio, and they seemed clueless as to what was going on.",

The mist wasn't very strong but we were fine in the heat. We ordered the sproccoli stuffed pizza, unaware that it takes 45-60 minutes to cook. Our waitress, Dru, was extremely friendly and attentive and made sure we were comfortable during our wait. We also got a small dinner salad with house italian. It was delicious and a decent portion. Finally our pizza came. It was huge! (we ordered the 10'). We really enjoyed it, but maybe not for such a long wait.

The Bazookie as describe by the menu is \"a 1/2 pound of Chocolate Chip dough, slightly baked in a 6-inch pizza pan then topped with 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.\" Things started out with the appropriate amount of consideration for the other diner til the first bite was consumed. A fire was noticed in each others eye. Utensils soon became weapons. Ground was won and lost. The battleground was a deep dish pizza pie pan that was spun numerous times in order to gain advantage for the best and perfect bite. Spoon fulls of warm cookie dough were knocked down back onto the table to be taken away... It turned ugly quick. No offers of sharing or giving the last bite. It was fought for tooth and nail. The dessert was THAT GOOD.   I would go back to Phoenix for this dish alone. And the pizza? It is a pizza joint, but that's not what we talk about or remember. The pizza was good, but not on the level of the dessert. Freshly baked chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla ice cream!!!! What more do you people need???",

I suppose some of it is nurture...the cattle ranch was a hard place to grow up and I did not eat pizza until I left home at 15 for college...Shakey's in Corvallis, OR:)  Losing my pizza virginity was a revelation and a delight:)...I was forever altered...forever better:)  And there is, no doubt, some nature involved...I can only think of 2 things that I can't eat and neither one involves pizza of any sort:)  And that brings me to today...I will at least try anybody's pizza pie:)  Some are better than others, but very few are truly bad:)  So when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night, it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it in:)  We were not disappointed:)  The entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks, while we sat comfortably and listened to the music:)  When we got our table...outside, under the mist...our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable...but we already knew what we wanted:)  It's all pretty good at Oregano's:)  This time we had a deep dish pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and olive pie, along with a Mrs. Gibbilini's spinach salad...way too much for 2 people but the leftovers are great for lunches and dinner for 2 more days:)  We've had the thin crust, the Chicago style, sandwiches, and salad...even the wings, on occasion:)  The pies are well designed, well prepared, customizable and tasty!  The sauce isn't too sweet, the cheeses selected for the pies complement the sauce and the crusts are well made and have great \"tooth\"...the right mix of crunchy vs. chewy:)  I've seen the debates...oh yes, I read the reviews...\"Chicago pies rock\"...\"New York is the only real pizza\"...yada, yada, yada:)  Well, I am waiting for a pizza to rock my world the way that first slice of Shakey's pepperoni did, all those years ago...it may not ever happen...they say you never forget your first time:)  But Oregano's always serves up a good pie (regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago, Thin crust, deep dish or whatever...along with all the accompaniments and alternatives I could ask for:)  Does Oregano's rock my world?...No, only the Beautiful Carin does that these days, but they do bake up a pretty decent pie:)",

    "text": "If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.  This particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option.   Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.  The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems.",

(Glad I did!  The place was packed and the wait was long!)   I ordered the Pesto Penne Bake, sounded good enough. I received my order and the first thing I could smell though the closed bag was the garlic! (thought maybe it was just the garlic bread-ha boy was I wrong!!!)  When I got back to the hotel I opened it up and the smell of garlic was even more overwhelming!  The pasta bowl looked good enough though. This dish has so much garlic in it that it is not edible to the average person!  (I had to open the patio door to the room just to air out the garlic smell!)   If you can get past the overpowering smell and taste of the garlic then it was a good dish.  But I must say the garlic is what ruined it for me.  Don't think I would go there again if I was in town.",

Peter bluck piper, pizza slut, domino no's, Pucky Johns and a string of mom and pops that make Tombstone look gourmet! Streets of New York used to be a good pie but they are slipping bad! We do have La Piazza Forno which is delish but they are hard to get into.   Why I like the Oregano, I first came here on a blind date. Message, no matter how many times your friend says he would be perfect for you slap her face and run away! The best thing about this guy was that he suggested Oregano's for a Saturday lunch. I had never partaken in the deliciousness of Oregano's.   He ordered basket of fries, UFOs (no longer on the menu), & a pepperoni pizza. Big guy this was appetizers! I tried the fries they were tasty, the UFOs I fell in love cheese stuffed artichokes dipped in batter and deep fried oh yeah baby! Sadly I must morn their departure. Then the pie yummy and I just love the square cut reminds me of home. Illinois!   I had ordered the baked ziti one of my favs and now I don't recall his food order It was another kind of pasta. Let me just tell you the ziti was colossal! Humongous! I barely at a 4th of it, I see a doggy bag in my future. Not iron jaws geezus he ate a basket of fries, half a basket of UFO's and 3/4 of a Med Pepperoni pizza plus all of his pasta and the bread bowl!   I was scared to get close I thought he might eat me! I love the Iced tea to it is china mist passion fruit and it's fantastic.  I will definitely be back, On a side bar I never order the deep dish on a dine in. The deep dish Stuffed One-O is fabulous, call ahead and get it togo. I usually call about 1 and a half hours before I want it and get it hot and delicious!",

They were a little on the burnt side but yet, not hot when they were brought to us.   SERVICE: I felt like we had to flag down the server everytime we needed something. Drinks refills took longer than they should have.  There were 2 of us that went for lunch and we were there for over 2 hours. Ridiculous...

    "text": "My friend David and I arrived at Oregano's around noon on a weekday. I was hoping there would be outdoor seating, as natural light is so much better than fluorescent lights for food photography! Luckily, there were open tables on the back patio, so we were showed immediately to a table protected from the sun by an umbrella. David was quite surprised by the fact that we didn't have to wait. In the past, he'd waited for anywhere from 45 minutes to over an hour to get a table. Oregano's is notoriously busy--and w/notoriously slow service.  Aside from being HUGE, the menu is packed full of dishes. Surprisingly, there are no mozzarella sticks listed under the appetizers. Instead, pick from items like stuffed mushrooms and Italian guacamole, each averaging around $5-6. We passed on the appetizers, going right for the heartier stuff.  David suggested we have pizza, as he'd had it in the past and really enjoyed it. We considered getting a whole pie, which is available in thin, pan, or deep-dish crusts. Specialty pizzas at Oregano's are particular inventive. Take the 'Frisco, for example (\"A tomato cream sauce covers this baby, topped with spiced feta cheese, bacon, diced roma tomatoes and cheddar cheese\"), or Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato (\"This family favorite is made with our red pepper pesto, Grandma's special roasted garlic chicken, diced roma tomatoes, gorgonzola, sliced potatoes, havarti, our four cheese blend, caramelized onions and fresh rosemary\").   David also ordered a small dinner salad ($2.99) for us to share. Our waiter explained that the salad would take longer than the pizza (huh?), so he said he'd have things timed so that the salad and the pizza would arrive at the same time.  After we put in our orders, I watched as other tables were served their food. A number of other diners ordered salads, each of which appeared to contain a serving of greens more suited for a giraffe.  Fewer tables ordered pastas, but a couple options there looked pretty good. I'm not such a ricotta fan, but if I were, I'd be ordering the Big 'Ol Ravioli for $9.29: \"A large 6\" ravioli (1/4 lb) stuffed with ricotta and other Italian cheeses, slathered with our meat sauce, then baked with cheese on top.\" Just thinking about it makes me want to play Frisbee...  If you're not hungry enough for a flying disk of stuffed pasta, go for some layers instead. Four different lasagnas, all priced at $9.29, seem like a good options for those who are willing to wait 30-45 minutes for a special dish. The chicken lasagna piques my interest, while the artichoke version combines an unusual ingredient in a very traditional dish. I wouldn't expect that sort of risk at a chain restaurant in Phoenix, of all places, but it's good to know that such options are available.  In addition to the pizzas and pastas, Oregano's covers another base w/sandwiches. The sandwiches seem pretty typical of what you'd find at your local college pizzeria: meatball and Italian subs. In terms of quality, though, these sandwiches appear to be a step or two above University Pizza and Wings, the likes of which deliver to drunk coeds until 3 a.m. Oregano's subs are served on 10\" rolls or focaccia.   By the time I'd finished daydreaming and people watching--half an hour later--our food had arrived. The small salad was really anything but. The two of us still had leftovers, so the small salad would probably be a good side for three or so people. The fresh mixed greens contained nary a brown leaf. Topped w/tomatoes, red onion rings, and a surprisingly large portion of crumbled gorgonzola, the salad is a different take on the ho-hum house salad.   I didn't fill up too much on salad, as I had pizza sitting in front of me. Each pizza turned out to be a quarter of a full pie, and each massive slice was served on a large, circular pizza tray. No matter how you eat the pizza, it's pretty darn good: the crust is very thin, but it's not crackery, and the bottom has a tad less char than I prefer; the cheese is mild, chewy, and a tad stringy; the toppings are fresh and plentiful. The amount of sauce may have been a tad much, and I also found it too sweet.  If the marinara sauce doesn't satisfy your sweet tooth, the one dessert at Oregano's will. The pizza cookie is a half-pound cookie topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. For $4.99, this dessert is easily enough for four people.  While Oregano's food is above average, the food is not worth the epic waits so common for a table at the restaurant. In a rush, Oregano's is the last place I'd want to eat. But on a leisurely night, when I don't mind waiting too long for a table or for my meal, I'll head back to Oregano's for its friendly service, reasonable prices, and above-average food.",

On any given night, Pizzeria Bianco has a 2+hour wait, Cibo has an 1+ hour and then there's Oregano's with their ridiculously long wait as well!    Several people had recommended Oregano's for their Chicago-style deep dish pie, so this particular Thursday night, my coworkers and I came here for their stuffed pizza which takes 45 minutes to bake!  Here's Oregano's menu description:  \"The \"piece de resistance\", we take a deep dish, add a light crust and fill it with cheese and fresh ingredients. We cover it with a layer of thin crust and top it with a tangy sauce. This \"stuff\" is so good, it'll take about 45 minutes, but it's worth it!\"  How could we resist?  So, we order a few things to nibble on to pass the time... Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad Wings of Fire Bistro Classic Pizza and of course, the stuffed Numero ONE-O Pizza  Salad, Wings, Classic Pizza....ok, nothing spectacular, usual chain restaurant tasting food.  An hour passes, where's the Numero ONE-O?  We ask our server, she tells us it's on its way.  Another 15 minutes, it looks delicious and HUGE!  One bite, it's still cold in the middle!  What!?!  No we don't want to wait for a new one!    I wish we had gone to Cibo instead!",

I find it to be infinitely better than most other Italian chains (the BARFY Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carrabba's), but not quite at the level of Maggiano's or Il Fornaio.    The food here is OK, although there are a few standouts.  * Alfredo the Dark pasta with the poblano peppers.   * Lady is a Scampi pasta * Pizza Cookie (or whatever it's called) * Italian Fried Potatoes  Btw, that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries.  Being the waffle fry whore that I am, I have to say these are quite good.   The baked sandwiches are OK --- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders.  The pizza is OK as well.  Being a thin crust lover, I find the crust at Pizza Heaven and Pizzeria Bianco to have a better-tasting texture.  It's almost a little too thin (read: cheap) here.  Kind of like notebook paper.  How do I know?  Because I've tried it.  The salads here are big, so be warned.  Can't comment on the taste though because I haven't had them.  The 1950s swing/jazz motif, tomato sauce cans, and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way. But what I like most about this location is how they preserved the \"Damen/Herren\" bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of Bavarian wonderland.    Among the cons here are the parking NIGHTMARE and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits (on Mondays even!).  This place is ALWAYS packed.  I do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100.  They must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans.  But even so, they should know that NO ONE in Central Phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van.  The parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning Oregano's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic BOOBYTRAP that is 10th St.  Drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling Oregano's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th.    Staff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at Jamba Juice and Cold Stone Creamery.  It's kind of cute, but borderline annoying that it seems trite.  But there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so I'm not complaining.  So there you have it.  Not exactly great, but I will be back soon.  Visit 4,763 is coming up next week.  P.S.  For stalkers who care, Phoenix Fire Department DOES eat here often.  In fact when Melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters.  She thinks those guys are \"en fuego.\"",

Upon arrival, parking was a bit cramped and I could see tons of people waiting outside. I'm thinking I just want a drink and food, no wait and this looks like a 30+ minute wait. Fortunately, open seating was available at the bar, so we grabbed 2 seats!   Corina help is while at the bar and was attentive but not overbearing with her service. She recommended the peach Bellini for a drink and my friend agreed! They were pretty good! I ordered wings with the Italian Gold sauce and they were good with a side of fries! My friend had a Jr. Caesar salad that was huge and she enjoyed it.   Overall great food and drinks, fast service but crowded with iffy parking!",

We had the hot wings ('of fire'), and they were a little weird tasting but certainly hot, the stuffed rigatoni (tasty pasta with even tastier garlic bread), and the chicken Caesar salad, which is, by far, my favorite item at Oregano's. The chicken Caesar is so good because the chicken is spicy and delicious...that's it. This is a must order. Will I be at Oregano's again? Of course I will.

This is the first place I've thought deserves less then 4 stars.   I brought my daughter in around 330pm on a Friday afternoon to get a quick bite before a concert we were going to. Walking in is just like any other Oreganos. We were on a time crunch (1hr) to get some chow and be back on the road. We ordered some drinks from the waitress who was totally on the order and friendly. After we got our drinks and placed our order, another waiter told us he was taking over since our waitress had gotten off of work. No worries I thought. I ordered a Small Pizza, and my daughter got Pasta. 30 minutes after I ordered I was thinking ok, now we are having a issue because we got to go. The place was empty except for a few tables, however food seemed to slowly... I repeat... Slowly drizzle out of the kitchen. I told our waiter we had to go and got our check and paid ahead of time. Another 10 min went by and our food finally came out. Seriously, 40 minutes... He had a few minutes to eat and get going so we weren't late for our meet and greet with the band. Aside from just being slow with food, the waiter seemed to not really care all. Ill mark this location down as one to not visit.",

When we were seated it was a pretty good atmosphere, very nice, clean and our table was a half circle table with loads of room.  My oldest son and I ordered the Big Beef sandwich and my wife had a pasta dish with a mushroom sauce. My youngest son had the shrimp scampi.  The sandwich I had was phenomenal, I mean every bite was tasty, the bread was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle but the havrati cheese and spice from the pablano peppers was the key here. My kids loved their food and my wife did as well.  We are coming back my wife and I for a date night. Absolutely fantastic place...food, atmosphere, drink and the whole experience!",

    "text": "I have been to Oregano's restaurants many times and the food is consistently delicious. Generally speaking, I recommend this chain. You can count on great food (and usually a long wait), which speaks for itself.  This review is particularly for this location at lunch time. We had a party of 7 people and were told it would be a 25 minute wait unless we sat on the patio. The inside of this one seems particularly small, since we arrived right at 11:30 and it didn't seem that busy.   1) Initial acknowledgement and drink orders taken/delivered in a timely manner. They did well, but the waitress informed us that she was also tending bar.  2) Order taken promptly. We had to wait a few minutes, but not too long.  3) Food delivered in a reasonable timeframe. NO WAY - 20 minutes for salads and 40 for food. I had to get up and ask about the food as we were neglected during this time. Salads arrived warm.  4) Once food delivered, server checks back within a couple minutes to ensure everything is correct and you don't need anything. FAIL  5) Order was correct - Yes  6) Check brought quickly once meal is complete and payment processed and returned quickly. FAIL  7) Staff was friendly - Yes  8) Food quality - Great - I had a salad which was tasty.  9) Value - large portions and good value especially if you stick to the lunch menu.  Having someone tend bar and serve tables at the same time reflects poor management. Even though I complained about the time, my concerns were not addressed by management. It took an hour and 45 minutes for our lunch. This is not acceptable. We should not have been offered the patio if they do not have the staff available to provide decent service.",

This place is really tucked away but even though the parking isn't great when you get in there the patio music and black and white old tv/shows playing were delightful. I had 2 orders of the zucchini sticks because they where that good aswell the house made ranch dressing was great, not that horrible vinegar after taste you usually get. Wow! We were so full after that but had already ordered dinner. My 14 year old son got the stuffed pizza with REAL cheese from Wisconsin (funny because the take home box said exactly that it was real cheese and not the fake stuff, lmfao). I have never seen soooooo much oooey goooooey and REAL CHEESE on a pizza before. Figure a thin crust, red sauce then 2 inches of REAL mozzarella cheese, your topping and more cheese then red sauce (delicious). More cheese than I have ever seen on a pizza. One of the friendly staff said please let me help you with serving the first slice, because the cheese never stopped it was stretched 5 feet up and still a long stretch of cheese WOW WOW WOW!!!! I LOVED it sooo much and my son even more.  Okay so my boy is eating his main meal and me and mom got a diablo shrimp and a lady scampi shrimp. Wow  both were so tasty. A bit spicy on the scampi and even a heck of a lot more on the Diablo (this was very creamy like Alfredo sauce but kicking it up several notches). Biggest shrimps I have seen on a $15.99 menu. 6 large shrimp (half a pound at least) in your pasta with special sauce and an 8\" slice of French bread drenched in garlic, butter and parsley. Also they will bring you fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. So we have a full menu of spicy delicious Italian food, with plenty of cheese, oh and best pizza we have had in a very long time. I don't want it from anywhere else right now, btw I ate 2 shrimp and maybe an each on each side of this bread. This was the lady scampi. Please go and enjoy great food.",

So whenever we visit them we always make it a tradition. As you can tell this review is so long overdue but I am super excited because we will be back to AZ next week and I'm ready for another one Oregano.   I've been to oregano multiple times now and I must say the only downfall for each visit is the wait time (but they serve delicious food so it's understandable). So during our first visit here was that we waited for at least 45 minutes to an hour but it wasn't so bad because there were servers walking around and was handing out free garlic bread samples (which tasted amazing). Pretty good advertisement if you were to ask me. The (-1 star) is from the second visit, our family waited for a table for nearly 2 hours and nobody even came to check up on us if we wanted anything. I honestly don't know what happened there. Maybe they were just really busy and they had no time to hand out free garlic bread but honestly it's not even that.. We had kids with us so a simple \"hey guys sorry for the wait.. Do you guys want anything to drink?\" Nothing like that until we got seated. But I'm not mad the food was amazing after all that wait.  Ohhhh also the first visit they had come to ask us if we wanted to order a deep dish pizza while we wait so that when we got seated it'll be ready for us to enjoy.. I think that was pretty awesome and smart thing to do. We will be back oregano! Sometime next week :) I'm soooo ready. Hahaha.",

Prob my favorite dish in the entire world. Also love their super garlic-y calamari.   I've also never had an issue with their Yelp waitlist (always seated pretty much immediately), although I do try to go outside of peak hours as the place is almost never not packed.",

    "text": "Horrible service! The employee with the beard is straight up rude to customers, the entire restaurant's staff is completely disorganized, and there's absolutely no communication between the staff.    When we arrived we let them know we had a group of ten and they let us know they had availability for us right away, but it would be a high top table. That's perfect, let us check with the rest of the group, we asked. While checking another employee took others to our table. The younger hostess girl recommended to the bearded guy that they could ask the just seated people if they wouldn't mind moving to another table so our larger group could have the two side-by-side tables. He shut her down immediately. The wait went from 0 minutes to 30 minutes, but we were fine as it was an honest mistake and things happen.  Then, while waiting for the next available table to finish, another random employee showed up and tried playing host himself. He ended up sitting ANOTHER group who had arrived after us in the second spot they were planning for us. He was the third person trying to play host and apparently wasn't aware of the waiting list. They then came back to us and said the wait would now be about an hour.   Wow, not one but two screw ups because of the lack of communication and disorganization. 0 minutes to 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The time wouldn't have been an issue if we had originally been told the time, but this wasn't the case. The bearded guy became argumentative when we mentioned the timing issue and tried flipping the blame on us. Nice try, but you failed. When called out on him trying to flip it, he then admitted it was their fault but still had an attitude. What a guy. We left and are definitely never coming back.",

    "text": "First of all, I did make a reservation in advance with Yelp, and was told the wait time would be about 20 minutes. We arrive and are told it will be 50 minutes. That's fine. I understand yelp may not have been up to date but there were only 3 parties ahead of us, and none as large as our group of six. Many open tables, including outside, so I wasn't able to understand a need to wait that long. Fortunately after about 25 minutes they seated us inside. Mind you we did say first available, and this was actually a pleasant surprise. Once we were sat, I asked our server Micky if the lower booth by the front of the building was any wider, since a few of our party were larger people. She said in the same breath, \"I don't know. Probably not, but you have this booth.\" Strike one.  Moving forward, we placed our orders for drinks, which she promptly brought out, mixing up who had what. No big deal, its drinks, it happens, we passed them to the right people. Not really an issue, except when seen with all the others. Next, we ordered our food. Everything went smoothly till I placed an order for a pan pizza, and made it clear that I have had an issue MANY times in the past with the wrong sauce being put on top, as I don't like the chunky tomato topping. I was very clear in asking for just plain pizza sauce, not the normal chunky sauce. She acted like she had no idea what I was saying but wrote it down. It made me nervous enough to change my order before she walked away after taking everyone else's orders. I changed to the ziti, and VERY clearly asked for just a plain meat sauce, not a chunky tomato sauce, and she looked right at me and said \"a plain meat sauce is ok with you?\" Yes, it was.  At this point, it became clear she didn't like people who wanted substitutions or special orders. Mind you, mine was the only order with any alteration to it, and a minor one at that. She began avoiding our table. We had to flag down two other servers to get refills of tea and soda because she avoided us. THEN the food came. Everyone else had the right order. I put the fork into my ziti, and its all chunky tomato sauce, no meat in the sauce, and very hard pasta that was overcooked. When another server came by to ask if everything was ok, she stopped behind them. Once I said my sauce was wrong etc, She made me feel like I was lying. She said there is no other sauce, JUST the chunky tomato sauce. AND she said it had meat in it, which clearly my dish did not. At this point, after she outright argued with me at the table, I handed back my dish, and said I couldn't eat it because of the chunks. She just gave me a dirty look, and took it away. WITHOUT offering to bring anything else, or to remake the dish.  From this point on, she sped past our table and wouldn't stop. Not even when we waved at her, and politely called out excuse me. It took having another server stop to help us, to get micky to come back to the table again. At this point everyone else had eaten, and our two late guests had arrived. One of which had ordered then left to pick up our other friend. The other person placed an order for cheesy garlic bread with ranch to dip in, got it, and ate it. Nothing wrong with either of their orders. I finally got up at this point, and made my way to the hostess stand, and asked for your card. Your host, a young man who clearly was not happy to be there, told me he could just get the current shift manager for me instead. I told him flat out I wanted your contact information, and not a shift manager since none had bothered to come over to ask why a dish was wrong etc. This is 40 minutes past the time when my food came out wrong.  The host came back out with your card finally, and told me the shift manager would be happy to speak to me. I told him no thank you, I preferred to contact you directly. I went back in, and stood by my table as my leg was bothering me and it was easier to stand at this point with my cane. Micky or the host must have said something to the shift manager as to who I was, because NOW, when we were finished eating, he comes over and asked if everything had been ok, and did we have a nice time. I told him I would be handling my issue. He again offered to help, but at this point we were waiting on the check and ready to leave. I didn't want to have an issue at the table in front of everyone, so I told him I would handle the issue later through email. He left. Micky dropped the check on the table and vanished again. At this point we were fed up with her very clearly rude attitude. When next she tried to speed past us, even though we had the card in the folder and it standing on the edge of the table, we ALL called out to her asking her to come back. She ignored us, till another table said we were trying to get her attention. She took the bill, ran the card, muttered something about having a nice day, and left.  All in all, HORRIBLE experience that left me making PBJ for dinner.",

Mini me enjoys their pasta with spaghetti sauce and always takes another bowl home.  Hubby got the meatball sub that came with homemade chips and coleslaw and I ordered the Italian Flag Lasagna.  Our calamari starter came pretty quickly and we all enjoyed it. We all like the batter and seasoning on the calamari as well as the marinara sauce that it came with.  It took a while for our food to come out but when it came out finally the food looked good.  When they brought out the main dishes to us, they offer to put cheese on top and you can have as much as you like.  We all enjoyed the food. I noticed there was a kick in the sauces though but I truly did enjoy and liked my lasagna and definitely would get that again along with the garlic bread.  The portions are generous and priced right. For everything we got, it came to about $53 before tip.  I got to try the chips on hubby's plate and we both agreed the chips were so delicious.",

The chicken is incredibly flavorful -almost so much flavor that I didn't think the salad needed much of the spicy chipotle ranch dressing (I asked for the dressing on the side).  My boyfriend ordered the \"The Coop de Ville jumbo chicken Parm\", which is his go-to pasta dish. The chicken was very juicy and the dish came with two large pieces of pan-fried chicken topped with marinara and cheese. The fettuccine was cooked well too. A gigantic piece of garlic bread was served on the side. The bread was perfectly crisp and deliciously slathered with butter, herbs, and some garlic! Definitely come here for the food, but there could definitely be some improvement on the service.",

    "text": "Like most places that serve deep dish pizza, Oregano's is very crowded, which is only further fueled by the long periods of time it takes to prepare that particular style of pizza. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. It's just a system where wait times should almost always be expected.  Years later, I'm still kind of in shock that Oregano's decided to open a location in West Valley, something that Sam Fox wouldn't do even with a gun held to his head. But as for this Camelback location? It's mostly what you'd expect. Typical Oregano's food with servers that are friendly, although somewhat slow.  I work with someone who absolutely loves Oregano's, but often forgets that in order to go here for lunch, you need to set aside a significant amount of time in your schedule, as well as arrive here as early as possible. Or else, you'll just end up being waitlisted.  Anyway, while Oregano's is known for their deep dish pizzas, they also have a big following based on many of their other options, including their absurdly large salads and pastas for people who are quantity-obsessed.  Nothing is horrendously bad, but nothing particularly stands out as anything special. Both the Alfredo in the Dark and Big Rig are generously sized Americanized pastas that work for people who want something just a notch above Olive Garden-level.  Their deep-dish pizzas are flaky, often drawing comparisons to a biscuit. Whether that's a good or bad thing really just depends on how your brain is wired, I guess. I recently tried to obtain one of their lunch special \"stuffed pizzas.\" The place had been open for a mere twenty minutes, only for the server to inform me that they were already sold out. You can easily imagine my annoyance while I spent the next hour watching servers bring out multiple stuffed pizzas to other customers while I'm stuck eating a bland pasta. I guess you need to order it within the first five minutes? Christ!  I've always taken issue with the fact that they claim their pizza cookie is the original, when in fact, it was BJ's Brewery that invented it. With that said, their take on the dessert, which has since been duplicated by tons of other restaurants, is actually one of the better versions that you'll be able to find. I consistently give them credit for this.  While I don't think their food is for everyone, if you're more of a traditionalist when it comes to your pizza bistro-styled places, I think you'll feel right at home at this Oregano's.",

    "text": "Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.  The outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.  They have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.  The food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.  For us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks.",

The small ceasar salad had amazing dressing and was big enough to feed 3. Will return to try something else.",

We figured, well, not a huge selection but maybe they do those few things really great!!  NOOOOOOOOOO.... not the case. I can't say about the pizza... but, we started with a side salad which was excellent - I had such high hopes for dinner!  Shortly there after we received our  Bruschetta Authentico (hmmm... reverse order)...  these was a huge plate of bread and the bruschetta mix. It was bland & tasteless and way too oily.  I live for bruschetta when I go to Italian Restaurants but skip this in the future - we even reread the descriptions a number of times trying to figure out why it was so horrible..... tomatoes were not rip for starters but the spices were just not right.    Now enter what they call Italian Flag Lasagna. It was simply the worst Lasagna we ever had. My dinner companion loves Lasagna and rarely complains about anything. He stopped eating it and pushed it aside as well and I had to ask him if his was as bad as mine was.  We both got it and neither of us could literally \"choke it down.\" The noodles were mush and the entire Lasagna had been obviously pre-cooked and microwaved. Costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree.  We basically asked the \"manager\" if anyone was looking at the items coming out of the kitchen because it simply shouldn't have been served. While they did not charge us for these items it is a sad state of affairs when an Italian place can't figure out lasagna.  We decided to strike Oregano's from our dinner list....",

Second time we went in, for lunch, all three of us got salads, but were super hungry so we wanted to order the stuffed mushroom app (seemingly the only somewhat healthier choice) and were told it would take 45 min for those since they were baked. Skipped it too then. The food here is good, no complaints, it's just kind of ridiculous to have to place your order over the telephone and wait a bit before you go out to eat. At that rate why not just get it to go?",

My husband and I recently started going here within the last two months and we are definitely regulars now.  One time we had to wait about an hour but during our wait they served the crowd pizza as they waited.  I thought that was awesome!  This business rocks...and definitely gets 5-stars from me!!!",

    "text": "Went on a Wednesday night with family and to sum up my experience: meh.  We ordered our food consisted of the baked pesto pasta (which was good, not spectacular spectacular) and the little cousins wanted the ridiculous 20 dollar holy-mother-of-pizza-pies and the server asked if this was our first time here and warned us that it would take 45 minutes.   Why no, I did not know that, but thanks for pointing out that I am a certified noob here at Oreganos.   My stomach almost screamed 'Ohnoyoudidnt' and my hand immediately snatched back the menu, going straight for the appetizers. The boom dip was pretty good, and for four people was enough. Probably my favorite dish of the night since I could actually taste chunks of artichoke unlike the usual artichoke dips that taste like I paid 10 bucks for 0.20 cents of straight melted mozzarella. For some reason, the server decided to torture us by serving both the pasta at the same time as the pizza even though we asked her not to. After an arduous hour of waiting where I was ready to part the crowd like Moses and run to Cherry Blossoms instead, the monster came and all I could see was a pile of cheese and oil dripping off the pan. I may be a fatty, but this goes beyond Paula Deen-'buttah'-level. The cousins and I all agreed that we could have gone to pizza hut, had the same delicious pizza, and eaten 5 more boxes in the time we waited.  Then, the little cousins wanted desert and they wanted the pizookie. I wish the waiter had warned us AHEAD of time that it was going to be another '15-esque minutes' but jk it's actually 25 minutes after ordering. By the time it got to our table, we were all too full and tired of being at a restaurant for so long.   For a restaurant that's so small, you would think the food would come faster, or at least they would train their servers to be more careful about warning customers about the time it takes for certain foods to come out like other restaurants.",

The staff loves to keep people waiting for appearances, even when the restaurant is empty.  The last time we were there, we waited almost a half an hour for a patio table.  80% of the patio tables were empty and most of the staff was standing around with nothing to do.  The host finally came back to us after 20 minutes of waiting and said, \"You guys wanted a patio table right?\"  \"Yeah,\"  \"Ok, it'll just be a few more minutes,\" with no explanation.  We just got up and left and haven't been back since.  Don't bother.  There are too many other options in the area with better food and service, as well as shorter wait times.",

    "text": "It was my first time here and was a spur of the moment decision to go. I ordered the Monday lunch special 2 slices of Chicago thin crust with one having bacon and pine apple and the other sausage and onion I also added the garden salad and a appetizer of the calamari. My husband orders the Monday lunch special 6 in Chicago deep dish and a Caesar salad and we both had dr pepper to drink . It wasn't so busy when we arrived the host he was amazing very friendly and enthusiastic wish I knew his name but I can say he isn't boring . Our server was Jules she was also friendly and gave good service. Now the food is where they fell short we ordered the calamari way before the meal and our salads arrived before the calamari which my salad was not a garden salad but romaine and two very thinly sliced tomatoes and two pieces of thinly sliced red onion with ranch . When the calamari arrived it was over cooked and rubbery with a fish flavor I have only had calamari two other places and they were really good so I was disappointed in the flavor and rubbery calamari. The pizza arrived and I was told the next time I had to get both slices with the same toppings I looked at my pizza and to my disappointment I received Canadian bacon instead if bacon as I specified as bacon bacon. Then as I was eating my sausage and onion slice I noticed the fork I was using had a huge piece of dried shaved Parmesan cheese on the handle it went from the end of the fork to half way to the prongs of the fork. I lost my appetite after that and I didn't ask for the manager but jukes had him come out he did apologize for it and said he was embarrassed and because of the service I give them 3 stars . I may try them again but not too sure right now and we tipped Jules 15 bucks for being so awesome and she was very apologetic and earned it .",

We figured for a party of three on a Friday night that was reasonable.  Well all we ended up doing was waiting... For 75 minutes.  We were waiting near the host stand and all we could hear was the unprofessional conversation amongst the hostesses which was a real turn off.  Then when we were seated, our server (a tall blonde) was in no way personal, attentive, or responsive.  It really seemed as though she didn't care at all.  In all honesty, we tipped out of obligation, not because our service was good.  In fact, our experience there was pretty awful.  The food was alright, but certainly not worth a 75 minute wait time.  I would honestly recommend avoiding this particular location.  I don't know what management is doing there, but they're doing something wrong.  It's really disappointing to be quoted a wait time then wait longer than twice that amount of time without any sort of compensation.  Do yourselves a favor and make your own pasta at home.  It'll be cheaper and probably better than the 'fine dining' at Oregano's.",

    "text": "I'm not exactly a fan of thin crust, but I gotta admit, Oreganos crust is pretty tasty... this coming from a pan/deep dish loving girl! It's probably because of their inventive toppings. My favorite is the El Picasso... Crisp tortilla chip topped pizza? I AM THERE!  I also like to eat there wing and salad style, split with a friend: Mrs. G's Spinach Salad and Italian Gold Wings, the latter is thanks to a friend and fellow wing-lover of mine who moved away. As it is made with mustard--I hate mustard--I would've never thought to order it, but she told me they were her fave and we had a wing night and I agreed! I've even made a noodle dish with the sauce--it is THAT good! My fave prior were the Wong's Wings, but alas, they have since deleted it off their menu. I can heartily say, even if they were still on the menu, the Italian Golds still win the Gold!  Another thing I miss off their menu are the waffle fries. They recently changed their fry option to Bistro sweet po's... but couldn't they have both? I know Sweet potatoes are better for you, but I LOVED the crispness of their waffle fries paired with an order of wings to share. Now I have to go to Ticoz for the Crisp Waffle Fry fix--the only alternative is Chick Fil-A... but theirs are mushier.  And as the sweet ending? The Triple Vanilla Scooped Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie, of course!  I've had other things off the menu through the years... The Frisco, Pesto Pizza, Original Salad with that Raspberry Dressing... but they are just okay.  My only complaint is the wait... when this place gets busy, it gets SO busy--Even for to go orders! I had an experience once where it was a 45 minute wait to eat there and a 1.5 hour wait for a to go order... WHAT?! And even when dining... the wait is pretty long... but I don't notice because I'm usually enjoying the company I'm with... so, if you bring great friends and lots of time, you will be fine!",

    "text": "Oh Oregano's, how shall I rate thee?  When my husband and I moved close by, we frequented this location. Or, at least tried to.  The parking is INSANE. This is no exaggeration. There is really, seriously no place to park. On several occasions we wanted to eat here and didn't because we had no place to leave the car.   I was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once I was there. Everything I ordered was less than awesome. The Pablo Picasso salad was dry, with very little dressing, and way spicier than described in the menu. The Southwestern Shrimp salad is supposed to be on a \"bed of fried noddles.\" Sounds decadently delicious, right? It tasted like cooked and re-dried spaghetti. Literally inedible! The Big 'Ole Vedge sandwich sounds amazing but tastes totally bland, no flavor whatsoever. My husband has given the Italian Wedding soup a few different tries, but finds it is always way too salty. He gives their pasta the general description of \"bland\"; no matter which one he ordered, they all tasted the same.   The only awesome food here is the pizookie cookie. A decadent, AMAZING dessert that, now that I think about it, I can easily make at home for half the cost and none of the hassle.   Oh and the wait. An hour, minimum. No exceptions. You will always wait at Oregano's. My husband and I went so far as to CALL to put our names in, WALK to the restaurant, as parking is impossible, and we STILL had to wait nearly an hour!   I keep wanting to give them another try, I'm not sure why, but my husband is having none of it.",

I started off with Sweet Potato Fries, which sadly had some spice on them that I didn't enjoy, as quickly as they saw I wasn't eating them they removed from the bill and offered any other appetizer for me.  I decline and waited for the pizza to arrive..   Wait the 45 minutes, get the deep dish, and be in heaven!

I strayed from my carmelized onion, gorgonzola pizza to try their spinach salad. Not a single regret - it was super tasty!  - That damn pizookie. Even if the food in general sucked, I'd come here just for the pizookie... mmmmmm.   If you haven't been... you should go!",

I keep coming back, however, because it's a fun, friendly place. I'm a big fan of their quirky shirts (today's read \"legalize marinara\"), and the servers are always smiling as they go about their business. Most everyone goes out of the way to make sure you're having a good experience (today, for instance, I was promised a donation of dozens of empty cans for the school at which I work).   I'll be back, and I'm hoping to try the deep dish pizza soon.",

The sauce is perfect,, the toppings and cheese are wonderful, and the dough is excellent.   I don't typically find myself at the Camelback location since I live close to old town Scottsdale.  But yesterday I had a craving and decided to order from there and pick it up on my way to work (this location is much closer to there). Had an 8\" Sprocolli which I nearly finished off myself when I made it to work.   The only thing I am disappointed in was the wait. I got to the restaurant and went to the pickup area. I guess one of the customers ahead of me had some sort of an issue, because it took a lot longer than I expected to pick up the pizza. But the staff was so friendly when I finally made it to the register, that I couldn't even hold it against them.",

The first time we went we didn't want to wait an hour for our deep dish to cook, so we opted for thin crust. It was decent. Last night we ordered takeout and got the deep dish. We ordered at 4 PM and it wasn't ready until 5 PM. After digging in, we didn't know what the buzz was about. The crust was thick like a deep dish, and the toppings sparse like a thin crust. There was hardly any sauce. That's not what we know as a deep dish and I definitely can't see why it would take a hour to cook. We've had deep dish in Chicago and it was 100 times better and took 15-20 minutes to cook.    I do love the Oregano's Favorite salad and the pizza cookie, but everything else- from the wait time to the pizza- are not worth going.",

I have made stops at such places as Old Chicago, Pizzeria Uno and various other pizza joints claiming to have Chicago style deep dish pizza. And I have of course discovered Zachary's Pizza in downtown Berkeley, CA, which I consider to be the best.  I have now discovered second best.  Oregano's Pizza was FANTASTIC the other night, with an outstanding spinach, mushroom and sausage deep dish pizza topped with unbelievable service. We also tried a stuffed portobello mushroom dish which was just wonderful.  There are still a couple slices in my fridge that I continue to find myself staring at, seeking the right moment to have a secondary experience with this delicious food.  Lastly, they have a \"pizza cookie\" that I'm pretty sure I can't live without. I've made it this far, but I'm not exactly sure how. I am NOT a dessert person AT ALL... this was possibly the best dessert I have EVER had. You cannot leave this restaurant without ordering one of these!  I highly recommend this great restaurant, however I must say that I was not impressed with the wait. We were on a waiting list for over an hour LATE on a Saturday night... guess you pay for popularity.",

The waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches.  After suggesting what size he thought I could handle, even though there was two of us at the table, we went with the ten.  Apparently I can handle ten with no problem?  Not sure what he was referring to on the size, it seemed like a pointed comment with innuendo towards myself.  He told us it would be 40-45 minutes.  After a nice conversation, with my friend at the table, we asked on the time as it seemed like it had been at least 45 minutes.  When we asked the waiter then quoted I stated it would be up to an hour.  Hmm, 15 minute grace period?  My friend being a Taurus, fired at him to check on the status.  He then came out and told me it was almost ready.  He then brought it out and quoted the time it took 49 minutes.  Food was great, I learned a lesson in time and apparently sizes.  I'm hoping he was not a representation of the staff as I'll pass on that.",

As I prepared to return for a quick valentimes whistle stop return, my one request was to sit outside again in the warmth of the desert and drink a beer at Oreganos.  I didn't quite get my wish, as we decided on dinner rather than lunch, and at that point it was even too cold to sit outside for this Michigander.  But all that melted away as we ordered the Picasso.  A finer, tastier deep dish pizza you will never have.  Not Chicago, not anywhere. Yes it takes 45 minutes, but we were surrounded with fantastic company and drinking delicious beers, so the wait flew by.  So while I normally eschew the chains, I make a large exception for this local AZ wonder.  Can't wait to return Oreganos - next time we dine al fresco.",

During visit in Phoenix some friends took me to try this place out. They swore up and down that it was good. Reason for being adamant was because I've been to other places and have been majorly disappointed by claims of being so called deep dish when in reality is was bread fluffed up with smeared tomato sauce. I can attest, none of that was evident here. Ordered a pie... LOL... PIE! Kept is simple with Pepperoni and sausage and it was amazing! I felt like every other pizza was blasphemy compared to eating this! Puts everyone else to utter shame! So if your in market for deep dish and happen to be in the city of Phoenix, this is the place! Aside from being in Pizza Heaven, service was great. Our waiter along with other staff worked as a team and made our visit enjoyable. Wait times wasn't horrible as we waited about 15 minutes on a Saturday night and mind you the place was packed. Overall, gave this place a 5 star rating, would most definitely recommend!",

When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest, the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panic.  The food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable.  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful, and my staple.  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top, which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day.  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE.  Like, I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes.  Still, I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys.  The salads are great, the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly, which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing.  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough!",

There was. 45 minute wait but we got lucky and found a spot at the bar. The inside is very eclectic and warm, and we were greeted multiple times from everyone there. We perused the menu and decided to try their deep dish pizza (which they warned us ahead of time would take 40-50 minutes to make) so in the meantime we got the deep fried ravioli with jalapeno cheese and it was very good! We also got 2 almost 24oz beers to go with it and the price was decent for those. We finally got our pizza and it was delicious! We were a little wary of the price but since it's deep dish, you pretty much take the rest home and have leftovers for the next 2 days so it's worth it! We will definitely be back and bring friends because you could easily get a meal for 4 people out of their servings.",

I can see how parking would be a challenge but we found a spot in the main lot behind the restaurant. They were quite busy.  But we waited on the shady patio and had a drink at the bar.  There were 6 of us and we were easily seated at one of their large booths inside.  We were hungry and looking back we admittedly had eyes bigger than our belly's.  We ordered the Bruschetta Authentico and the Lawrence's Stuffed 'Shrooms to start.  The fresh onions on the Bruschetta really added quite a bit of flavor, I didn't find the addition of the marinara provided necessary.   The Stuffed mushrooms were 2 large portabella mushrooms stuffed full of sausage marinara and melted cheese.  It took a little effort to cut them up and share, but they were quite good. In fact they would make a great  main dish to share with a salad.   Two in our party put in Lasagna orders for one of each variety at the same time as the app orders as it takes 30-45 min for Lasagna.  The rest of us took a while to decide on what we wanted.  The other 4 of us ordered the Aunt Margherita Pizza, 2 ordered the Alfredo The Dark and added broccoli and I ordered the Zainy Ziti and added sausage.    All plates were extremely generous servings.  I personally made 3 meals out of my Ziti dish.  It was simple yet tasty and served in a baked thin crust bowl.  I sampled the Margherita pizza which I found to be lack luster.  The Alfredo dish was not as flavorful as I would have expected and was slightly rescued by the seasoning on the southwest bread that is served with the dish.  Had my dining companions not chosen to add the broccoli I would have considered this a little plain. It was not as creamy as expected (good and bad).    I can see myself taking a trip back here. I look forward to trying some other menu items.",

While their menus and servers give you fair warning that because they make everything from scratch that it takes longer to make. However, I know that its just a marketing ploy. The longer they make you wait (by telling you that perfection just takes time) the more you'll want it. By the time the food makes it to you, you're starving. At that point, everything tastes good, right?  Off the appetizer list, I have tried: - the Guaca-Tony = fresh guac and pizza bread with WAY too much parm on them, also expect a 20 min wait - the calamari = actually pretty decent, reminds me of mozzarella sticks though - the garlic bread = wish the bread didn't come out of a plastic bag - sweet potato fries = ok - waffle fries = ok  Sandwiches - italian sausage sandwich = spicy sausage, buy the jr size since the full size is too much, cheese looks fake and is not good if you have to reheat it the next day - meatball sandwich = standard, no wow factor  Pizza = if you have about 90 minutes to wait, the pizza is pretty good.   Have not tried any pasta but my friends have ordered it and it did not look amazing.  Bellini's = good strong mango/peach margarita  Pazookie= skip the food and just order one of these. It does take 20 minutes to make but you can choose between chocolate chip, white chocolate or peanut butter cookie.   Service: Slow. I'm not sure how many tables each server is assigned to but not only did we have to wait for our food, we waited for drinks to be refilled, waited for the server to bring us a box and waited for the bill. If you can't tell by now, lots of waiting.",

Everything we ordered was soooo good. The salad was so refreshing. The garlic cheese bread was delicious!  The pizza was cooked perfect.  We got the thin crust and it was so tasty.

I didn't mind waiting for the pizza we knew it was gonna take that long. Absolutely the best stuffed pizza I have ever had, and I was told to try the cookie dessert. It is probably the best dessert I've ever had!!! No joke if you like cookie dough you would love it!! I will go there every time I come back to Az.",

When we spoke to the mgr. all he could say was he didn't know that she brought it in.  And he was doing the best he could to accommodate them with a seat on their outdoor patio.  REALLY, because they should be in your restaurant at all.  We asked him if the board of health would shut them down for this and his response was, \"She says it's not venomous.\"  They were more considerate to the attention seeker with the snake than a paying party of 12.  I followed up with a call to their corporate office and spoke with their area manager.  He plans on coaching that store manager on ways of better handling situations like this.  His empty apologies and hardly gracious $20 gift card will not be getting me back as a customer!",

I do have my favorites that are a must-see! Nate the manager is fabulous. Takes care of me just like a server would. Literally can walk by your table and offer to fill your water for you and check up on you. Wonderful service.   And actual server I must recommend is Miguel.

Although they don't take reservations, I used yelp to get on the wait list ahead of time and an hour long wait resulted in only a 5 minute wait once we all arrived at the restaurant. If you haven't used yelp for this,  you should because it takes the hassle out of going out to dinner during prime times!  Food here is always good and reasonably priced. Hats off to all the employees who make this place a great choice to dine.",

When we opened the bag, we noticed we were missing the most important part of our order...her sausages.  These are my daughter's favs.  She was very disappointed and it ruined her appetite.  Against her wishes, I contacted the manager.  She was very pleasant and apologetic.  She wanted to make it right but we were already on the other side of town.  She took my daughter's name and took care of her on her next visit.  Make sure you allow for enough time to enjoy the goodness of the food.  Definitely worth the wait if you have the time.",

There were 17 of us and everything went very smooth.  Our server was on top of everything from drink refills, to clearing plates, to serving everybody's food at the same time, etc.  Excellent, excellent service!  For food, me and my buddy Jon split an 18 inch thin crust pizza with sausage and olives.  The 18 inch pizza looks like a behemoth, but it is almost paper thin, so you can eat a lot of it.  It was delicious!  I had only been to Oregano's one time before, and I got a sausage and onion stuffed pie.  I remember their sausage being really delicious, and today confirmed it!  This pizza had huge chunks of sausage all throughout the pizza.  It was awesome!  Everybody else ordered a wide variety of foods from lasagna, to salads, to pasta dishes etc and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Portions are HUGE!  To finish the meal, we ordered a couple pizza cookies to pass around the table.  A salted caramel one and a chocolate chip cookie one.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is a perfect dessert.....a huge cookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream!   I have to mention the excellent service once again!  Everyone in the restaurant worked as a team (getting refills, delivering food etc) and on the way out, every single person we walked by thanked us for coming in and wished us a good rest of our day.  I mean, EVERY. SINGLE. EMPLOYEE!  That is rare these days and it was nice to see.  I can't wait until they open the Oregano's out near my house in Surprise.  I know I will come here often.  The pizza is fantastic and the service has been 5 stars both the times I have been to an Oregano's.  Good stuff!",

The sauce they used at a point in time or at the beginning was very good, now it seems as though it's just a paste of some low cost band and not even a sauce any longer. I've tried several locations to see if it was just one place, although not the case. Each and every location has changed. Thank god Chicago's Lou Malnati's is now in town and is continuing to establish many locations. Lou has it right and I think Oregano's needs to step-up their game if they expect to stay competitive!",

I ordered the calamari appetizer and it was so salty I could hardly eat it.  I had also ordered the coop de ville jumbo chicken parm.  THE COOP DE VILLE JUMBO CHICK PARM Hungry? We'll fill your tank with a great American classic! This model rolls off our assembly line and into your stomach with a HUGE all natural chicken breast served on a bed of fettuccine and topped with our homemade marinara, provolone and our four cheese blend. It's a real thrill ride. Hop in!  The huge all natural chicken breast was a piece of flattened breaded chicken breast that was over cooked almost burnt and again so salty I could not eat it.  Everyone at the table agreed that the calamari and my so called huge natural chicken breast were beyond too salty, it was inedible.  I told the waitress who wanted to get me another one, but by that time I was so off the food, I couldn't wait to get out of there.  Also, my sons ordered pizza that was so salty one of my sons could not eat that either.  She did not take that into account when giving us the bill.  Both of my sons have worked in food services and were amazed at the lack of quality and the lack of compensation for food that was unfit to eat.    Seriously, you can always add salt - you can never take it away.  What is with the cook at this location that the food is so bad?  Needless to say I would not go there again.  It was a disaster of a birthday dinner, to say the least.  This is the letter i just emailed to the corporate office.  This used to be a good meal, but not so much anymore.",

We always have a bigger party when we come and they do everything they can to accomodate us. This last time, we screwed up and gave the wrong number of people and when they tried to sit us, we didn't fit so we had to wait a little longer for another table. The manager came out to us and gave us a free appetizer (fried ravioli with jalapeno cheese...WOW!!). He didn't have to do that since it was our mistake. But, another great reason why I love this place besides the amazing food. The ambiance is great. It reminds me of an old 50's italian joint.  They have your basic Italian food...lasagna, noodles, pizza. Ill stop there. Pizza. Yummo. They have thin, pan and thick crust. We ordered the thin and it was perfect. Can't complain and this is our go to place.   **Only reason they are getting four stars is the parking and wait. It can get a little long for the wait so don't come hungry...you will get grumpy (MEEE). Parking sucks too so you will have to find a spot on the street somewhere (this location is not in the greatest areas of Phoenix so lock your car).",

Today: our order took 45 minutes longer than promised. After finally asking the young lady to check again she laughed and said \"oh it's been ready a while now\". The meatballs in our order were so badly burned they tasted like feet so we had to throw those out.  Also, while waiting a lady came in to pick up pizza and the toppings were wrong so it had to be redone. My husband told the manager he would buy the mistake pizza (it sounded delicious to him) so it wouldn't go to waste. The manager gave him a super dirty look and said \"why would you do that?\"...okay never mind...",

Despite my doubts, we decided to take our friend's advice and try this place. We rolled up on a Sunday night, and there was 45 minute wait which seemed to be a good sign.  Once we were finally seated, we were served by the peppiest server I have ever had in my life. Seriously, ever. At one point, when I asked for a refill on my water, she took my glass and SQUEALED, \"Water! Yay!\" Never have I felt so affirmed in my choice of beverage! Thanks, peppy server.  As for the pizza, it was so, SO good. Deep dish, perfect crust, juicy tomatoes. No hating necessary--this is a Phoenix pizza joint that's worthy of the Chicago label! If we ever make it back to Phoenix, we will definitely stop back at Oregano's!",

The portabella mushrooms were maybe a tiny bit under cooked but had a wonderful flavor. The piece-de-resistance though was the PIZZA. It was simple wonderful. To much food for three people. We enjoyed the left overs the next day. We are only in Phoenix for a month but will visit here again before we leave. As a side note; If you are in a hurry eat elswhere. The wait was 30 min. and the deep dish pizza takes 45min. to cook. It was worth it!!!!",

I called to order a roast beef thing, but completely forgot that it was Streets of NY that has that thing...that number 10. I decided to just go with it and ordered the Big Beef. It's super spicy, but I had the poblano peppers and habernaro mayo left off. (Technically, I didn't know the mayo was spicy. It was the waitress on the phone who suggested that it be left off and I'm glad she did...I wanted no heat!) I asked for mushrooms to be added .89c extra. The phone service was great, friendly and accommodating.   I get to the place and open the back door and greeted by a super friendly waitress who asked me if I came for a pick up. She was getting menus from the outside area. She grabbed them and said follow me. I went to a station inside where she told me someone would be right with me. Another person said, \"I'll be right with you.\" They assisted me seconds later.   The Big Beef is MASSIVE. (Two meals) Tons of meat and cheese. Served with waffle fries AND a side of coleslaw. I was speechless!   I got it home and like I said, couldn't eat the whole thing. It was tasty, flavorful, filling and worth every penny! ($12 and some change) Great service, great food. So glad I decided to go with this order when I realized it was the wrong place. I WILL BE BACK!",

There is a small lot behind the restaurant and other than that there is a neighborhood you can park in. but make sure you read the no parking signs to avoid getting any tickets.   We didn't call ahead or anything so we had to wit 40 minutes for a seat, but it was fine because we just sat at the bar. It was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday at 6:00. The staff were very friendly and accommodating though. When we were seated I ordered and appetizer, the stuffed mushrooms. We were informed that the deep dish pizza took 40 minutes to make and I wanted something to munch on. The appetizer was super yummy. The sausage was a little spicy for my taste, but still really good.   When our meal came out the pizza was definitely the best part. We got both thin crust and deep dish pizza and I enjoyed both. We got a pasta as well and I thought it was just meh. I wouldn't order it again. We got the cookie dough dessert which was also delicious. Overall the meal was super good, and the staff are really nice, but if you plan on coming (especially on a busy night) make sure you have a while to wait.",

I had the Alfredo the Dark, which had a bit of a southwestern twist by using peppers with alfredo sauce, which was a creamy, smoky, and savory treat. The pizza comes with a cracker-like crust, so if you are a fan of New York Style or Chicago Style pizza, this may not be to your taste.  We went here with our friends who are regulars and had a lot of fun joking with their server who was fast, friendly and fun (all you can ask for in a chain restaurant). They have a fun, casual vibe with lots of photos on the wall and big booths. They have outdoor seating with misters to enjoy the AZ heat.  When it comes to Italian food in AZ, and you want to avoid the fast-food feel of other chains or the fancy costs of swanky restaurants, Oregano's hits the spot.",

It must have been prom night, hence the long wait; however, seeing how they had so many benches for people to sit at while they waited to be called, they are probably busy every night.  The hostess even came up to us to see if we wanted anything to drink.  We weren't even charged for our iced tea.  After an hour of waiting, we finally got seated and our server was nice, informative, and tended to our needs in a pretty timely fashion.  He didn't even mind that our 14 month old daughter kept tugging at his belt.    We ordered the honey mustard wings and sweet potato fries as starters and they were delicious.  The chicken wings were a little on the \"too fried\" side but I think that's relative to your own palette.  The flavor was awesome.  The sweet potato fries was delectable.  Definitely tasted like they were using \"fresh oil\" to fry the fries instead of \"old oil\".  That's always a good thing.  We ordered a 10\" Chicago style deep dish with sausage and pepperoni.  O.M.G.  That's all I can say about it!!  It was awesome!!  I could only eat one piece, however, b'c I was so full!  Our dishes definitely came out slow but our waiter did inform us of this beforehand so we weren't disappointed about it.  Besides, you can rush good pizza, right?!  I don't know how busy they are any other time of the day but we got there around 4:30pm on a Friday and waited an hour to get seated.  I definitely recommend coming here to try out their food but if wait is a concern, make sure you call ahead to see if they are busy!  I want to emphasize the really great service.  We were asked how our meal went, our waiter was really nice, and we were given a warm good-bye, too!!  Thanks for a great experience Oregano's!",

I went with the midday rush, $2.99 for a slice of pizza, $0.79 for extra toppings. My \"slice\" of pizza was actually two large slices. What a value! I loved the thin crust. I added the caesar salad for $2.29 - very good. Not fishy at all.   Their garlic bread was delicious as well. I wish we'd have tried the garlic CHEESE bread.

    "text": "Arrogance or ignorance?  I don't know and I don't care.  Dec 7th, I got home and considered my options.  A stuffed pizza from Oregano's, God, that sounded SO good. I called at 8:13pm and ordered the pizza.  \"You know this pizza takes like an hour\" the super-happy server asked.  \"Yes I do\", I said.  At 9:00, I left my place at 20th St. and Missouri Avenue.  7th Street was closed.  ?!!!  Central Avenue: closed.  7th Avenue, closed.  A parade...  Oreganos: Thank you for calling Oreganos! Me: Hey, that pizza for Teddy?  Won't be able to pick it up... Oreganos: Why is that? Me: BECAUSE ALL THE STREETS THAT LEAD TO YOUR RESTAURANT ARE CLOSED!!!!!!!!!!  Why wouldn't you tell me that? Oreganos: Oh...I thought that parade would be over by now.  (Laughing) I could 'run it out to you'...oh, just kidding!  Literally, while hungry, an entire 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  Oreganos didn't know or didn't care...that The Parade of Lights Parade all but closed access to their restaurant.  Fool me over and over again.  All for the love of a stuffed pizza.    Hey!  Oreganos!  I'll come back, at some point.  But my point now is, it'll be 6 months-year from now, instead of one/week.  Any kind of customer service, \"Gee, sir, I'd love to get you that pizza but you'll have difficulty getting in here until 9:45\", that kind of customer service.  So, I could not go south but I could go north. I ate a delicious pizza from the new Rosatti's on 16th and Missouri.  Fabulous!",

I have been to Oregano's about 3 times in my life because I avoid those two things unless I really want Oregano's food. The last time we went, it was 8:30 at night and our wait was still 20 minutes to be sat. Another 20 mins to get our food, so by the time we were done eating it was almost 10 o'clock at night. The prices were pretty crazy too. The food is really good though so a 3 star rating is pretty accurate.",

I like a good deep dish, and Oregano's doesn't disappoint. Get something like Gorgonzola and you'll thank me later! Just aim for the less traditional toppings and you'll be alright. I haven't had much of the entrees, but the portions are generous and the quality for many the same as you'll find at other chain Italian eateries.  The drinks are hit or miss. Order the frozen bellini, it's amazing no matter what the season!    It's not the most original or tantalizing Italian fare, but Oregano's gets the job done. In style. Give it a try.  PS-Service improved greatly. Guest services was waaaay nicer than they had to be. Never turn down a place that cares about your experience!",

I love that they come in bread bowls! The Picasso salad is great as well and can feed 2-3 people! I love that they have huge servings that you can share. The wings and pizza are great as well!!   The only frustrating part about this location is that the parking lot is small and makes it hard to find parking, especially on busy days.  Another thing I wish is that Oreganos did reservations!

I've never ever been asked for my id for the past however many years I've been coming here. I just feel discriminated against. Maybe because i had gum clothes on and hadn't washed my hair? Who knows.

    "text": "I wish I could give this restaurant a zero star. We have had issues with this location at least 3 times. The first time, we ordered Hot wings and I've never see anything like it. They looked like frog legs not chicken wings. We asked the manager to look at how small the wings were and he looked at us like we were out of our mind. He didn't even offer to replace them or give us a refund, he just simply said we are so sorry. Second incident was a glass of sangria so watered down, i felt like I was drinking water with red dye. I told the bartender and she gave me another glass with the Same watered down Sangria. Third incident, which happened this Sunday, was how extremely arrogant a worker at that place is. I believe his name is Mike. I was walking into the side door to pick up to go food and he completely cut me off with no, excuse me. I walked to the counter to pick up food and he totally ignored me and so did the other person behind the counter. I called out to him and said excuse me I'm here to pick up food and he tells me the girl behind the counter is busy and the cashier was busy too. He said it in a very rude and arrogant tone, as if, you just shut up and wait! Cashier finally arrived and I asked to speak to the manager and when I made the complaint, he too looked at me like, how dare you come in here and complain. This place is by far the worst Oregano's. Go to Tempe instead. Their customer service is a million times better and not full of arrogance.",

I called the day before and asked about reservations to which I was told no, they do not do. I asked about typical wait times, and was told we would be fine they could handle it. Next day we arrived at 6:35 and were told it would be 15-20 min, 10 min later we were told it would be more like 40. 50 min pass, to my surprise all 5 kids were still behaving fairly well. Finally after 90 min we ask what is going in with our table and were told maybe 15 more min and that our party was simply too big for the restaurant! And the manager said \"sorry ma'am!\" What!? We ended up leaving and going to Peter piper for our birthday dinner. So disappointed! Rude! Inconsiderate! Down right ridiculous. Next time be honest. We will never be back. Worst communication and customer service skills. Poor boy at the front looked terrified.",

My family had visited Oregano's before, so they ordered a pepperoni pizza, O'riba pizza, Chipotle Chicken pasta, Spaghetti and Meatballs, Garlic bread, and Calamari. The calamari came out first and it was so crunchy and delicious with the marinara sauce. Next came the garlic bread, and then the pizzas and pastas were brought out. The pizzas were delicious! I enjoyed the thin crust, especially the crunchiness at the end. The pastas were great with cheese, served hot, and both sauces were incredible! I also liked that the Chipotle Chicken pasta came with garlic bread. The service was also amazing. Overall, delicious restaurant, and I will definitely be returning!",

Unless you're starving...you might want to opt into the smaller sizes of things; )  I usually go for dinner, but went out to lunch with a friend on this day. For pasta, the Big Rig w/ chicken is the way to go. I got their lunch size, and it was quite a perfect portion. I was perfectly full, and was actually able to still go back and put gym equipment together.   Pizza : they are literally all great! I like the number uno though.  Pasta: Big Rig w/chicken. They also have sausage and meatballs as options. Big Rig has a chipolte base, so it's a little on the spicy size.  Salad : Pablo Picasso. The dressing is a little spicy as well for this one!  Also, their cheesy bread is great! But also filling! (Appetizer)",

It's been a year since my move here and have gone without trying Oregano's despite the frequent mentions of this bistro. Came here for the first time and got recommendations from Yelp, since they serve a variety of salads, pizza and pastas.   I decided to go with the Stuffed Riga Tony and a Passionfruit Tea. The pasta was penne stuffed with cheese and covered with a meat sauce. Definitely filling and held about 2-3 portions in itself. The Passionfruit Tea was refreshing and comes unsweetened. Tried the Zainy Ziti and the Lady is a Scampi from others in my party and they tasted similar in taste, but differed in spice.  Service was great. Pasta is typical of Olive Garden, Maggiano's or the like. Food isn't mind-blowing good, just great in terms of price for proportion. Perhaps the pizza is better? Great place for large groups however and if you're looking to save a bit of money on food.",

Only ordered pepperoni and mushroom and it barely had any at all and very little cheese.  The cheese didn't even go to the crust so you have an inch of pizza all the way around with little to no cheese.  Hopefully the cookie will make it worth the price because the pizza did not. Not satisfied at all.",

Ordered a cookie skillet for dessert and ate about 25% and then found a hair underneath the ice cream, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back to let her know. I let the waitress know we found a hair and she said \" oh, it probably came from someone scooping the ice cream\". She then cleared everything from the table and took the check after we informed her about the hair. Never once offered to bring a new Cookie skillet even though we were only able to eat part of it before we found the hair. I was so sad about this because the pazookies here are amazing!",

Our waiter Kara, was kind, patient, and very tentative throughout our whole experience. I just wanted to make sure we gave her special Kudos because it was well deserved.  Besides the great service, all of our food was on point. We ordered wings, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and appetizers. It was my grandmother's first time at this restaurant and she was very impressed with the food. We can't wait to visit again and try more great items off the menu.

Bartender said someone will seat us in a moment. Three servers proceeded to walk past and not seat us. We waited close to 5 minutes. we're re-greated and had to sit outside and was told to wait so he could see if someone was outside to serve us. He returned to say, he was sorry but we couldn't sit outside because there wasn't a server out there to take care of us ...uhh... since when do we not seat sections? We order soft drinks to start while we looked over the menu. By the time our server finally came back we knew our whole order. Food and drinks. Appetizer came out before the drink. So we reminded her. Had time to eat a good potion of our apps before our food arrived... still no drink. It was 15 minutes after we received our appetizer that we got our ONE Mai tai!

We arrived at 6:30 and the wait was 45 minutes for a table for 2. I should have known to call and reserve a table, but didn't think of it in time. Nevertheless, we waited. It was nice to be able to use yelp to see our wait time and how many were ahead of us. We were seated and our drink orders were taken and I remember becoming impatient waiting for my water to come, although I did not note an actual time for how long it took. The menu was small so it was easy to decide what to eat. I placed an order for an appetizer and food. The appetizer took a bit for just being garlic bread, but it tasted delightful, and my main course came soon after which was the Alfredo the dark, and that was tasty. Although I didn't prefer the bread that came with it. The cheesecake is really good though, so worth it.  My server was good but was unremarkable. I couldn't even tell you if she told me her name. Overall a good experience.",

I ordered carry out to save time didn't happen. The cookie pizza was raw not cooked and no crunch. My alfredo dark had no dark as they forgot the pepper completely like making Michael Jackson white. I waited an extra 10 min on a piece of bread while other food was ready in a bag getting cold. The only thing that got them 2 stars was the host that was nice and made me a complimentary soda drink for waiting.

What I didn't love today was the extreme delay in our order and the lack of customer service.   Understanding that we did go to lunch at Oreganos on a Saturday during lunch time, I would not expect two salads and two think crust pizzas to take just over an hour. If that was going to be the case, especially since I had two young girls with me, it would have been nice for the staff to let us know that. We sat at the bar and their didn't seem to be a dedicated server or bartender. The staff kept changing, but no one was really attentive and they were forgetful. I paid my tab as soon as they took our order. I paid extra to receive money back for a good tip, but was short changed. The girl that took my money never came back and I because I was getting so frustrated, I didn't ask someone to go get her. No one updated on our order status at anytime. Super disappointed in our service today    The one saving grace was the salads were delicious and so were both of our pizzas!",

The waitress gave me a weird look but was totally accommodating and even went in the kitchen to make sure they understood my order.  I got one with mushrooms and spinach and one with sausage and pepperoni.    The pizza \"slices\" were much larger than I was expecting.  I figured 2 slices would fit in 1 box but no I got 2 slices and 2 boxes.  So with my luggage in tow and 2 boxes of oregano's, I was off to the airport.

Finally after a quick one day trip I said \"Bring home some of that pizza you always talk about\". He hand carried a thin crust Italian sausage pizza across 4 states.  And man was it delicious. I highly recommend going here. And foresee more hand carried pizzas in my future :)",

I waited one hour for take out food and they apparently lost my order and never prepared it. Unfortunately I waited exactly 1 hour for the food and then they told me I could wait another 15 min and they will actually cook it this time. I was to frustrated to wait any longer so I just left empty handed. Just dine in when you eat here and be prepared to wait for a little while.",

Came here with the family on a Saturday around 5pm, mildly busy took us 25 minuets to get sat, (understandable) had a great house salad to start off with. We ordered a deep dish pizza \"the works\" it took a solid 35 mins, but when the pizza came out, it was well worth it. I'm from California and have traveled all over and have 100's of different types of pizza, and this pizza I had tonight, was by far the top 2. Very cool atmosphere, very, very friendly staff! Perfect place to bring your family! We will definitely be returning back soon! ENJOY!:)",

    "text": "A friend from work and I had the displeasure of dining here for lunch today. We're only given an hour for lunch, but we thought that would give us plenty of time since we came right at 11am. We ordered the large Caesar salad to share. We asked for ADDITIONAL dressing on the side. What we got was the salad with NO dressing on it and one tiny container on the side. Clearly not what we asked for, but we improvised and just asked for additional containers so we could eat. And then we waited....waited....nothing. Finally had to flag down a bus boy to get our original server to explain what happened and why we needed more. He seemed dazed and confused, but got us some additional dressing cups. Salad out of the way, we waited on the pizza we ordered. And we waited.....and waited....finally it arrives. We asked for a thin crust pepperoni with mushrooms on half of the pizza. What came to us was a PAN pizza, and to top it off, the mushrooms were hidden so we had no idea which half of the pizza they were on. Again, dazed and confused server was told about the pizza mix up. He argued with my friend that this was what we ordered and then took the pizza back to the kitchen to discern which side the mushrooms were on. Rather than reject it and send it back for what we originally ordered, we decided to eat it because it had taken so long we were now late getting back to work. The pizza was WAY over salted, much too much oregano on it to the point it was hideous tasting. I choked half my slice down and was done. Server never apologized for anything that went wrong, nor any offers to take the wrong pizza off the bill. Terrible service and terrible pizza. Does this place even have a manager? We won't be back.",

    "text": "Jenny introduced me to Oregano's not long after we started dating. I'm not a big fan of chains or franchises -- even smaller ones -- but I'm also committed to giving any place a chance. Since that rainy day introduction some (three?) years ago, I've never really had a 'bad' Oregano's experience. But, that being said, part of the Oregano's experience is the long dining time which, on a weekend, generates longer waits for a table. So that's Oregano's.   The Camelback location has been our 'home' Oregano's since we moved to Phoenix. The parking here is a little tight and you'll often find yourself pulling up to the curb on one of the streets behind the restaurant. But the staff is great and there is adequate seating for your pre-meal wait. That all said, my go-to here is the meatball sub or the Big Bambino salad. The BigBam is sooooooo good and I like that the portions are sized to share.",

I've been to  3 other locations, but this place is the one that my friends and I meet up all the time. Sometimes we just end up sitting at a bar if we don't want to wait.  Parking is a joke here, but who cares! We come here for the food!  I've had the Pablo Piccaso Salad and the Julius Ceasar. Both are huge! 3 people can share this. Boom Dip is also awesome and most definitely the Bollo Pasta.   Portion sizes:  Perfect! This is the reason why we keep coming back.   Execution:  Also perfect.  If I were to find something (anything) to criticize, it might be just the parking.   Service:  Excellent. Waitstaff are very attentive and they give you  small samples of the blended bellini. (If you ask)  Totally squisito!  There's more to say, but you get the point.",

A friend and I split a small thin crust pizza and medium wings. We had plenty of leftovers after-wards. I have to say the price point is not bad. I just feel the pizza was kind of bland. For some reason it was missing something. The wings were great made perfect.  I dined outside and had no wait. I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked up to the hostess stand. As soon as I sat down the waitress came by to gather my drink and appetizers. I did not get an appetizer this time. The food came out quickly and the follow up from the waitress was great. The waitress and other wait staff did a good job waiting tables. I notice them working with other tables. Everyone seemed very happy. I will dine again but will order a different type of Pizza.

You can get in and out for lunch or dinner for somewhere between $9 - $12 a person and you can generally stretch this into two meals. (closer to $5 a meal)  The food is not bad, but in a city that has so much quality food to choose from, why settle for \" mehh :/ \" if you don't have to?  Service can be hit or miss, and on the few occasions I've been here was a long wait. Expect about 20 - 30+ min before your seated during the lunch hours. If you're here by yourself, you can slide up to the bar usually to get in and out quicker. If you're purely looking for the most quantity for your $, you've found a gem. I would try to find somewhere else if you are looking for a closer to authentic Italian restaurant.",

I couldn't stop laughing at the time and the server was very apologetic, but it was pretty brutal. Stained shorts and everything. What was especially surprising was that after waiting another 15 minutes for a new sandwich, we were still charged full price for the meal. Really???

We wait forever for our food, are often ignored by our servers, and now this stellar experience. No thank you.",

I waited....I waited some more...While I was waiting, I watched 3 different groups of people sit down and all 3 ordered and ate before me...Huh?

An hour and 10 minutes after we arrived they finally brought the meal to the table. The bread was soggy from sitting on top of the warm pasta waiting for the rest of the order. We returned one meal to the kitchen. I was 24 hours recovering from whatever wasn't right in my meal. The manager did apologize for the delay in the meal. He told us the kitchen had been filling a catering order.  He offered to buy us dessert. Our birthday celebration had gone from a fun event to a disaster. He was offering use dessert, which cost him nothing. The right answer would have been to give us the meal for free to make up for the pathetic experience. You lost us as repeat customers",

Disappointing since this is a place you are willing to wait for.    Staff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location. You feel a bit like your cramping their style. They are busy gossiping and making their after work plans so when they turn to attend to you with the over the top smiles and same question they asked only moments ago, it's a little annoying.

My friends ordered take out and brought dinner to my home.  Much to my disappointment, instead of the amazing salad I usually enjoy when eating at the restaurant, I got a container of iceberg lettuce with a smaller container of shredded chicken.  NONE of the normal ingredients (other that then iceberg and the chicken) were on the salad.  It was awful, if the iceberg had been missing literally nothing else would have been in the container.    Needless to say we were all very disgruntled, but given my post-surgery state, no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant.",

When I kindly asked questions his tone was very unpleasant and rude and you could tell he was not happy to be taking my order and wanted to get off the phone. When I asked questions after paying to the cashier Senyaceth, she was quick to get the manager when all I asked were simple questions regarding my order. Afterwards, she was very unhappy that I had to reorder my meal and was rude the entire time. Never asked for anything free, and I paid for my entire meal. I understand Saturday nights are busy, I myself work in the customer service industry and agree that it gets very busy. However, that's not an excuse to be unpleasant and rude.

    "text": "I'm so conflicted! On one hand, we were able to get seated in under five minutes of arriving. On the other hand, the food didn't sing to me, but rather just hummed along to a common theme.   Evidently, not drinking alcohol has either effected my taste buds or my perception of food, because I cannot honestly say I was impressed with last night's meal. The Boom Dip appetizer was okay, after adding red pepper flakes. But the Alfredo The Dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me. Was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta? The cheese wasn't melted, and I couldn't find any alfredo sauce in my pasta bowl. Par for the course, I ended up getting full and bringing about half of the dish home. If, at lunch, I decide this was a good meal and I was just misguided by not having alcohol with my food, I shall update my review.",

    "text": "Oregano's tried to kill me by putting me in a food coma.  Yes, the value is off the charts. The amount of food you get for the price is ridiculous. You can easily make one meal stretch into three or four. And it all tastes good.  The service really irked me though.   I had  never eaten at an Oregano's before, so I didn't really know the deal, but apparently everything on the menu (except salads) takes approximately 35-55 minutes to cook. Uh, seriously?   Our lunch (six women and 1 baby) took over TWO HOURS!? That's just insane.   When someone would order something our server would say \"You DO know that takes about 45 minutes, right?\" uh... No actually I didn't. Thanks for making me look like an idiot though.  We had appetizers, then salad, then pizza and entrees. We mostly shared everything because of the portions and time to cook, but the server never offered to clear our steady growth of dirty plates, and when we asked him to clear them, he didn't bring new plates or silverware.   And when he did finally clear some things, he held the plates over the baby's head... I mean Jesus Christ, have some awareness!   Yeah the food was good, but is it worth the time or the crazy amount of calories? No.",

    "text": "Ate here yesterday and I'm never going back.  I got there at around 4 45 pm and even though we were once of the only people in our section at the time of arrival we were the last to get our food after several other parties had sat down and ordered.  Mind you we only ordered one salad and one pizza. The salad was good but the pizza took incredibly long to get finished. Our server didn't seem very attentive and rarely stopped by to see if we needed a refill or to even say anything about how soon our food would be ready. Finally got refills only to come back with a dead fly in my cup. The pizza finally came and practically fell apart in a saucy mess the moment you touched it. The kitchen barely made an effort to cut the crust which was extremely hard and kinda burnt. Overall this place was just a let down. Several people had recommended it to me and hyped it up. I guess if you want to wait forever for your food, have dead bugs in your drink and get treated like a 2nd class citizen than this is the place for you.",

    "text": "One of the things I love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months.  I also love the Bellini, Toasted Ravioli, and Rosemary-Chicken Pizza.  There IS room for improvement, however.  The takeout \"system\" they are using has caused me to go somewhere else more than once.  I don't think that having certain pickup \"windows\" for loyal customers is a sufficient way to reward them, especially at that price point.  Oregano's, you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there.",
