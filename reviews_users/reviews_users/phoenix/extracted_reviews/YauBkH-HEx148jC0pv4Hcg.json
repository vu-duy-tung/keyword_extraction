Went for the first time on Saturday, Jan 4th and Jason was our server.  His service was outstanding, and he didn't make us feel rushed in any way, and answered all our questions and chatted with us a while.  The atmosphere was very inviting and had an authentic feel to it.  I ordered the Rellenos and Eggs with green chile and my friend got the Pork Chop and Eggs.  We both loved our dishes and ate everything on the plate.  The Relleno peppers are filled with your choice of pork, beef or turkey.  I ordered the pork and beef and it had such a delicious smoky flavor to it, like it was slow cooked.  Also ordered up a couple Bloody Mary's, only 5 bucks each and outstanding.  I will DEFINITELY be back to this place, and don't know why I didn't go sooner.",

We usually start with their Chips, salsa, and guacamole while I get a beer on tap. The wife gets a prickly pear margarita or a glass of wine from their great and reasonably priced wine list.  Although I have tried just about everything in the menu and many of their specials, I find myself going back to the chile rellenos platter. They offer two chiles stuffed with one of their several different stuffings. I like to mix it up and get one topped with red sauce while the other topped with green sauce. My wife is from NM, and she has stated many times that this is by far the best spot in AZ for NM styled food.",

That was 1.  before the place burned down,  2.  when they had a separate pizza menu with 25 delicious zzas that they served until 1 a.m.   3.  they had a short-glass full of loose cigarettes at the bar that patrons could just help themselves to  4.  when they'd serve free appetizer bites to folks around the bar  5. you could park your OWN car, and enter through the secret door in the back, and 6.  when the staff weren't jerks and appreciated the customer.  That's the part that gets me about this place now.  The food....great.  It's unique.  Try finding anything else like it anywhere, except New Mexico. I dare you.  Portions are ridiculous. You pay for it, but you can spend $20 easy for dinner at Red Lobster.  And this is no Red Lobster.  The atmosphere...great too.  Music is usually spot on. The place is comfortable. I like the no-windows thing, especially in the summer....it's cave-like.  The staff....jackasses.  Look, I know there's a line out the door, but you're still in the hospitality business.  So quit making me feel like i've got some-nerve asking to eat here. Get over yourself.  It's your jobbbbbbbbbb.......  I will say this, the cooks are some of the hardest working folks I've ever seen.  They are machines, and work magic in that tiny kitchen...somehow never running into one another. So, bravo cooks, keep it up.  So, go.  Just don't expect to feel welcomed.",

My boyfriend and I decided to try to get in last minute on a Saturday night, which in hindsight, was a ridiculous thought. However, on the way out a manager flagged us down and encouraged us to take advantage of their tables in the bar. This actually worked out perfectly and wasn't offered to us by the hostess, but I will most definitely look to sit in that 'hidden' area again.  I ordered their signature dish, the Pasta Heidi, and OH MY GOD. Insane. I didn't understand how pasta could be what put them on the map, but SERIOUSLY this was so good. Green chili pasta, grilled chicken, a yummy cream sauce all served on top of a tortilla. I crave this on a regular basis now.  Great ambiance with big tables which make me want to host a big dinner their just to utilize the cute space.   This place is a must, just think about maybe making reservations ahead of time.",

This restaurant is not the place to do so. For two weekends in a row I have sat on the patio only to be sorely neglected. I waited for 20 minutes to get a drink each time I sat down. This was because I discovered that the bartender outside is also the waitress for the entire patio. She is heavily bogged down and cannot accommodate patrons sitting at the tables. There were 5 of us, all four adults got their meal and were done eating when the 5th persons food finally arrived. I have no complaints about the food, but I also have no desire to give money to a place that has great food but crappy service.",

    "text": "What can I say about Richardson's?  It's a Phoenix staple with delicious food and amazing atmosphere; however, the service is lacking.  What does that mean exactly?  Let me tell you... We stopped here with four other couples on a bike pub crawl over the weekend, and sat on the patio to take advantage of a spectacular Happy Hour menu.  After ordering a few cocktails and appetizers, when it came time to settle our bill, our server said there was no way  she could split a check.  Moreover, after we questioned the logic (because who really doesn't have the means to split checks today?), she claimed that it clearly states this rule on the website.  Really?  That's the argument?  I checked the website, and there is nothing stating anything remotely close to her claim; and regardless, if that IS policy, why not clearly state that on the menu with the other \"You order, you own it\" rule? So what did we have to do?  We had to isolate each order, and write on the check the amount we wanted charged to each card, and had to ask the cashier to run each one separately.  Sure, we could have paid all on one card and figured it out among ourselves afterwards, but it's now about principle.  Moreover, in retrospect I wonder what she would have done if we all claimed not to know one another, thus required that the checks be split accordingly?  It's this type of policy, or simply lazy service, that makes me dislike a once highly recommended dining spot. It's to note, we never have any service issues while alone as a couple; it's only with others where we have concern. Additionally, service challenges aside, the food here is spectacular.  The bacon wrapped shrimp, along with the presentation, is one of the best happy hour selections one can make in the valley.  And the entrees are nothing short of amazing as well.  The blue corn smoked turkey enchilada is comfort food at its finest, and the smell of pecan wood just heightens the senses. Overall, we'll surely be back; however, between now and then I hope they can figure out a way to accommodate split checks.  If I can find an app on my phone in less than 30 seconds that does it, I would think a restaurant of this quality should have a similar solution.",

    "text": "The husband and I came to Richardson's for happy hour to celebrate our 9 monthaversary (and we had a gift card, so that helped). We sat at the bar, the husband got a beer, I asked for a bellini (since it said they had them on special on their menu) and the bartender looked at me like I was insane... I guess they don't make those anymore? Not sure. I ended up getting a mimosa, which was very good. The OJ tasted fresh and the glass was a generous size. We had a feast of happy hour food items that included: Blackened scallops, chicken tostadas, chipotle ribs, green chili sliders, and a green chili potato. Some items were delicious and some were not so much. The scallops (HH priced at 15$, so still fairly expensive) were the best of the bunch in my opinion. They were perfectly cooked and came with 4 different sauces, beans, and rice... it was all delicious. I would come back and just get that. The portion size was very generous. The ribs were the second best item. They were very tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The green chili potato was ok, but really not as special as I would expect for a restaurant's signature item. It is essentially a twice baked potato, but instead of putting the potato innards back into the potato skin, they stuff it into a pepper.... I thought the pepper was too firm and the flavors didn't completely complement each other. The filling could have been seasoned better. The sliders were alright, they were like little french dips sort of with chilies on top. I didn't love them, they just weren't that flavorful or special. The worst dish of the night was the tostadas... they lacked flavor, fell apart, and just were boring. When a menu states that when you order chilies, you're responsible for the heat level, I expect something will be spicy... but nothing was. I liked this place alright overall, but it was a bit inconsistent. I would probably come back for happy hour, but it wouldn't be my first choice in town.",

    "text": "This is going to be in a weird order, so sorry.  First I want to say that this is a beautiful restaurant. In fact it is one of the most beautiful restaurants I can remember going to in the recent past. The neighborhood and the very exterior are Meh, but as soon as you walk through the gate, just gorgeous. Even though I can't recommend it, it seems like a great place to sit outside at during the nicer months. The inside is nicely decorated, dark and cozy. Place is fancyish.  If you like wine and drinking, and excellent food or great service isn't really high on your list of priorities for a dining establishment, I would recommend this place to bring a date. It's nice and dark, and if my experience is representative of their service, you'll have plenty of time to chat with your date uninterrupted.  Unfortunately for me, I don't have a lot of game, so I go ahead and eat at most restaurants I go to, since that is what they are there for. I want very badly to find a New Mexican restaurant I like on my side of town, and today this was the place.   I may have made a mistake by doing so, but I sat outside for a minute and read a few of the yelp reviews beforehand. What I was looking for was an idea of a great dish, what I found was a few too many mentions of poor service.   Some of the reviews mentioned condescension and patronizing responses, but I might have preferred that. I got a lack of attention as well as lack of friendliness/helpfulness. The onus should be on the server to get a dialogue going and get some rapport built. It would take minimal effort.   As far as the food, this place is a step above your normal family restaurant price-wise, so if they are justifying the prices on the food, I just could not see it. It was decent, but not \"OMG this is great New Mexican food!\" If you value your money and would be upset by wasting it, my advice would be to try it on your own before taking the financial bath of bringing your family.   There are plenty of decent Mexican places around far more reasonably priced, and this place just didn't justify the cost.   My search continues. I don't think I'll be back to Richardson's any time soon. Not worth it. Sad.",

It would have been better had the service improved as our meal progressed but it actually got worse. It took forever to get our food. In fact, it took so long that the server apologized multiple times and offered my husband a free iced tea.   We ordered the Huevos Rancheros (three eggs, blue corn tortillas, red or green chile & cheese, potatoes or hash browns, beans & a tortilla) and the Carne Adovada & Eggs ( three eggs, smoked pork simmered in red chile, potatoes or hash browns, beans & a tortilla). Apparently their main seller is the Adovada. I did not care for it at all because it was smoked too heavily. But this is just a personal preference. My husband liked it and loved the generous portion size. He could barely get through it actually which was surprising since he's a pretty big eater. I liked my Huevos Rancheros for the most part but it was just so expensive for what it was. I added some ham to go with my eggs but the dish just felt way to heavy for me and I didn't enjoy it enough to finish it. With that said, I definitely preferred the green chile sauce over the red so please order the green sauce if you get the chance. Oh and Richardson's? Stop skimping people on the tortillas. For the amount of food that was served, you can definitely serve more than one tortilla.   I'm not sure that I can recommend Richardson's. I mean it wasn't bad in any shape or form but it also wasn't anything that justified the price we paid for brunch. It was just too expensive even though I'm sure everything is high quality and such. And that valet. Unnecessary. Plus, living in California means that I'm exposed to some fantastic Mexican cuisine and Richardson's did not blow my mind. A pass for me! 3/5",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 3.5/5 Happiness - 2.5/5  Richardson's is fine, but I don't think it is worth the price. The building itself is very unique and I have always enjoyed my time most when sitting in the outside lobby during happy hour. The restaurant itself is very cramped and very dim. You can hear every conversation and there simply is a lack of space. Water pitchers were constantly placed on the booth where my wife was sitting, meaning she kept looking over her shoulder to make sure they weren't dropped on her head. In my experiences, the servers never seem too engaged either. You get a bottle of water to fill yourself and rarely ever see the waiter post-order. On my recent trip, we got the wrong tab handed to us and it took us about 15 minutes to flag down the waiter to redress the issue.  The menu is relatively limited but full of unique offerings. My favorite is the pasta heidi - green chili linguine in a chipotle sauce. Very delicious. Their double baked green chili potato is also unique to Richardson's and quite delicious. I have also enjoyed their steak and fish offerings. But there are also plenty of just fine, nothing special options. That includes the Santa fe Chicken and their pizzas.   My biggest complaint is though the food is good, it simply isn't worth the price (mid $20s to mid $40s). A lot of the appetizers are the same price as the entrees, and I simply don't think the food justifies the prices.  It's a fun location, and the food is good. I simply have never felt compelled to make this a top option when I go out to eat.",

We were immediately greeted with a bowl of ice water for the pups and seated on the cool, shaded patio.  Overhead fans keep the area in the 70's in spite of triple-digit temperatures outside.  The chips and salsa are a MUST (housemade warm chips and 3 amazing salsas).  Very dog friendly (they have pork and chicken menu options for your pups at a reasonable price), and service and food were impeccable.  I had the New Mexican platter with a sampling of dishes - cheese relleno (excellent - my favorite!), chicken burrito (moist and flavorful), bacon-wrapped shrimp, rice and beans and red and green chile sauces.  The presentation was beautiful and the portions were enormous!  Paired with a margarita, it was a very memorable meal.  Service is warm and friendly here.  They clearly care about your experience.",

The Enchiladas with Red and Green Sauce (Christmas) and the pork-stuffed Poblano Pepper were fantastic (both traditional New Mexican dishes).  They offer a lot of different types of fish, but the preparation seems a bit of stretch to make it New Mexican. For example, I ordered the Sea Bass with an Orange Chili Glaze. In theory, this sounds delicious, but it was overly sweet with no chili heat for balance. This is a great date spot because many of the tables  and booths are in little nooks for privacy. The sweet potato filled chili is supposed to be what they are known for but for me, it was a bit meh and obviously made en masse before service (which is fine, but make sure it is hot when it is added to the plate). Great cocktails, especially the margaritas.",

    "text": "I had lunch here yesterday with friends and it was just OK.  I was disappointed because I love Mexican food, but can't eat hot spicy. It is recommended that you ask for a 'sample' before ordering a dish and I did so. The sauces had a lot of flavor, but were just too hot for me. I asked the waitress what she would recommend on the menu that was more suited to my taste buds. She said there was nothing but perhaps a pasta dish or hamburger. So, my friends got huge, beautiful, aromatic dishes of steaming food and I got a plain hamburger with skinny, cold fries. I was so disappointed. I'm not sure why restaurants only cater to clients who can add heat to their dishes with hotter sauces, but leave others wanting.  My friends loved their food and kept raving about them. So, if that is what you like, super, but don't invite your friends that you know can't enjoy it.   As if that wasn't bad enough, on the way out, we passed the patio area and there was a couple with their dog sitting next to the man in the booth, eating off the table!  This was NOT a service dog, it was a spoiled pet and it was disgusting to watch. I personally don't want to sit on a cushion where a dog has been licking tidbits off the seat and I certainly don't want to see a dog eating off a plate on the table. People are abusing their privileges of being allowed to take their pets onto the patio. I'm wondering what the health department would have to say if they witnessed such a thing. Yes, I complained and the employee placated me by saying he 'understood' and that things were 'sterilized' after dogs leave, but he didn't do anything about asking the people to put their dog on the floor!   There are tens of thousands of wonderful restaurants in Phoenix competing for my business. I don't think Richardson's will be on my list again anytime in the future.",

    "text": "The waitstaff has come off as fairly miserable on my last few visits.  The food is either not great or inedible due to inaccurately described spiciness levels.  The last time I went, I ordered the chilaquiles off the board.  I know this dish can vary greatly between establishments, but I've had excellent luck up until now and I order it whenever I see it.  It was awful.  Firstly, it came on a plate that was about 2' long.  Thanks for the head's up, waitress.  Secondly, the eggs were so incredibly spicy that I could not eat them.  Any of them.  Since the egg portion of the meal was the size of a regular dinner plate, this was a lot of waste.  The waitress apparently thought so too, because she became agitated when I declined her offer to box it up.    I told her I didn't want them because I couldn't eat them, because they were incredibly goddamned spicy.  She ignored that part and asked me if I would perhaps want to eat them later.  I said I figured they'd still be spicy then.  Then she asked me if I could take them home to someone.  I said I would never give this food to my animals.  THEN SHE TESTILY ASKED IF I KNEW SOMEONE ELSE I COULD GIVE THEM TO.  This B really didn't want to see the food go to waste, but wasn't super concerned that I had just purchased pounds of food that I hated.  I said no, that I wouldn't be ringing up my phone tree to see who likes their eggs with an entire jalapeno, and as she began to angrily suggest yet another option for the reuse of the food, my dining partner interjected and said that jesus christ he would just take the bloody eggs.  Waitress needs to STFU.  Seriously?  Seriously.  This isn't the first time I've been served something I couldn't eat.  I know it's ~Richardson's~, but write \"spicy\" on the goddamned menu when something is spicy.  Just do it.  As for the waitress, sister needs to research some food outreach programs to volunteer for.  She's wasting too much of her vigor being shitty to customers about eggs.",

    "text": "I have been to Richardson's many times and it still remains one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  For the people complaining about the food being spicy, um, it is a restaurant serving New Mexico cuisine - it is supposed to be spicy.  My favorite dish has to be the Relleno Platter.  I usually split it with a friend because the portion is huge: two rellenos with rice and beans.  I especially like the pork rellenos with verde sauce, but there's also smoked turkey, beef and regular cheese.  Their margaritas are outstanding...honestly, I haven't had anything that was bad at this restaurant.  And the wait staff is friendly, too.    I love their patio renovation.  It is stylish and sophisticated with a modern New Mexico ambiance.  Great for having dinner and/or drinks outdoors on one of our beautiful Phoenix evenings.",

Our server Tana was a 5 also she was engaging and we had great conversation with her. It was like she was a part if our table and party. After dinner we visited the basement bar and found it to be so cozy and inviting. This is an excellent restaurant and I will be back!",

    "text": "We have been to Richardson's many times in the past -- but after moving away and returning recently we decided to go with some local friends last night.  We have not been to Richardson's since the original (which we LOVED) burned down.  We had a 6:45 reservation and could only be seated on the patio -- which was fun, festive, and comfortable.  However, we had to wait a bit for our table so we sat at the bar and ordered up a few drinks.  The bartender was inattentive and aloof -- and the drinks -- margaritas, were horrible!  We were a bit surprised by this.  When we were seated at the table the bartender, again, was our server.  Before we even had a chance to get settled in she came over to take our appetizer order.  We explained that we needed some time because we were just getting settled in, and we still had our bar drinks in front of us.  In less than 5 minutes she was back again -- and quite annoyed that we weren't \"ready.\"    We decided to order appetizers.  When they arrived we were told the plates were HOT and to be careful.  Actually, the plates were barely warm!!  The queso was nearly cold and the skewers were cold as well!  We waited for her to return but she didn't -- so we picked at the appetizer and continued to talk.  When she finally showed up she was ready to take our order but didn't ask about the appetizers, so we told her they were presented cold.  She said, \"Hmmm, well you managed to eat most of it!\"  How inappropriate was THAT?? And, again, we weren't ready to order because we were busy talking AND we wanted her to get back so we could tell her the appetizers were unacceptable.  Finally, we ordered.  We asked her to please be sure the entrees were warm. Oh, they were warm, alright.  Each of us ordered something different but our plates looked almost identical -- TONS of red chile and everything was dark brown -- burned looking.  My burrito was unrecognizable and so covered in the red sauce as to be unpalatable.  The chile relleno was so-so.   We LOVE spicy food and love spicy chile! This was just unacceptable! Each of us picked at our plates and decided to give it up.  It was horrible! When the server resurfaced and asked if we wanted boxes (because most of our entrees were still on the plate), we told her we didn't.  Again, she didn't even ask if there was a problem!  This visit was not only disappointing, we will NEVER return.  Oh - and the tab for 4 of us was $180.  That would be okay IF the service and food was good!! This server was inattentive, annoying, and not service oriented AT ALL!  She got a 10% tip (and we are typically 20-25% tippers) and left.  We were also quite surprised that a manager didn't come around to check on things.  I can't believe they get repeat customers if that bartender/server is what they have to offer on the patio.  HORRIBLE!!!!!",

It tastes like the red chile has been made by red chile powder and way too thick. I had 5 people with me. All pro's on NM food. No sopapilla's at all. On a positive note the green chile pasta was pretty good even if the chicken that came with it was dry. The food was heated on the plate and half of the chile was stuck/burnt to the plate.",

    "text": "We took friends out to dinner last Saturday night- food was a 4 but service was horrible which is why we give the restaurant a 1.  First- it took 2 calls to get a reservation.  When we initially called, the woman that answered said she had to \"confirm with her manager\" and would get back with us in 48 hours.  After receiving no call back for four days, I had to call them back.  Next, at the table, the waiter just could not fathom or remember that our friend was unable to have milk product.  Even after the loooonnng, drawn-out conversation while ordering, he STILL brought her salad with cheese on it (totally discussed during the ordering process).  Finally, and this is the biggest downer of the evening, the bill seemed high and I couldn't see well in the restaurant because of the dimmed lights, but I signed it and paid.  Next day I look it over... We were totally OVERCHARGED... charged for 2 drinks we never had, and the drinks we actually ordered we wrong on the bill.  OVERCHARGED!!!  Don't trust this restaurant... I tried to contact them 4 days ago, received a VM that said to leave a message and they would call back.  No call back.  I left another message a bit ago.  This is seeming like a scam... I'm about to go to the authorities and report it... Very frustrating.  We will not be back and I don't think you should consider going.",

    "text": "It was a disappointing evening last Saturday when a group of us went out to celebrate our Friend's Anniversary.  It was mainly the service by our waitress that seemed lackluster and nonchalant.  In addition when I asked a couple of question about the menu, she seemed confused and not very knowledgeable about the menu items. In fact another person in our party also asked a question and her response was a blank stare and lack of knowledge.  In a menu that's not typically traditional, knowledge is essential.  There was also a mix up where our order of mushrooms ended up going to another table while we waited an unreasonable amount of time for it.  I ordered the NY strip which was ok, but not worth the price.  I did like the butter corn side though, that was tasty.  I really have no reason to return to Richardson, the menu isn't my taste, which is not their fault, just personal preference, but I feel that if we had a different server, our evening would have gone a little better.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed in this restaurant.  We made a reservation to meet friends out on a Saturday night to celebrate my husband's birthday - we reserved the table on OpenTable at least 4 hours prior, and included notes in the reservation that we would need a high chair for our baby.  The restaurant description made it seem like a family, friendly, casual place, but to our disappointment when we arrived they told us they did not have high chairs or booster seats.  Their solution was to put us in a booth.  Our young child can't sit up by himself while trying to self feed in a booth.  He can't even reach the table!  We asked if their adjoining restaurant had a high chair or booster seat we could borrow, and they said they didn't have any either.  This blew my mind.  Maybe I am being naive, but we have taken our son to some fine dining establishments in the Valley and they have always been able accommodate our need for a high chair.   This sounds like age discrimination to me.  They have to provide ramps for ADA or elderly people that use wheelchairs or walkers.  Due to our son's age, he too requires assistance during dinner in the form of a high chair or booster seat.   Unfortunately we had to cancel our plans with our friends because it was a Saturday night and it was too late to get a reservation elsewhere.   I am upset that they couldn't have even called us based on our note in OpenTable about needing a high chair, and given us a curtesy heads up that they didn't have any.  Had they done that, at least we could have found another reservation in a timely manner elsewhere, to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Btw- our child is very well behaved and doesn't create an unpleasant dining experience for others eating in the restaurant.  If he did,  we wouldn't take him out.  And if the restaurant is trying to avoid having small children, I have experienced plenty of unruly toddlers eating in restaurants that do not require high chairs - so they still are exposed to slightly older kids coming there.  They should just post on their website, or at the very least put a sign on their door reading \"small children unwelcome\" next to the \"no firearms\" sign.  I mean, they are basically one in the same, right?    #babieshaverightstoo",

Maybe it's because the now two times I've visited recently I've sat at the bar ( and am only reviewing based on those experiences, admittedly ), maybe it's just that I have too much bias from my memories of the old location but it's just not the same. While we were able to park our own car today, the usual mandatory valet requirement is a huge turn off.   The bar at the old Richardson's was a comfortable, friendly place you wanted to hang out at with friends, the restaurant was usually busy, vibrant and fun; you didn't much mind the wait to sometimes get in. Now it just feels like a bar. The interior here is impressive and frankly pretty cool, but the feel is different. A usual staple, the Prickly Pear margarita, is much too sweet now and seems to have not much kick to it. I'll stick to the nice wine or beer selection from now on if I return.    What does remain is that distinct aroma of wood-fired goodness promised within but I'll reserve comment on that as well until I try more of the menu; I did sample the calamari, which I enjoyed a lot but wasn't crazy about the sweet dipping sauce. I expect the food is still pretty good though overall the prices seem a bit high in general. The staff has been generally friendly but not overly enthusiastic.   I will very likely update this review some time in the future once I put more time in here, try out the restaurant proper and maybe the Rokerij. Still, to me, the character is decidedly different and I'm not sure whether that's good or not.  May have to see how Dick's Hideaway has fared since....",

We then moved to some of the best calimari I have ever had. On to the main course. Our top sirloin steak was cooked perfectly and had great flavor with the portables mushroom and seasonings. My wife got the Brussels sprouts with her steak. I hate Brussels sprouts with a passion, but WOW we're these good. I had the corn which was excellent. The green Chile potato was excellent. My son had the sea food pasta which he said was very good. The shrimp and scallops were nothing to laugh at, they were yuge! Desert was a chocolate cake served with chocolate sauce and raspberries and blue berries. Yummmy!   Well, that's was out 26th Anniversary, and I am glad we spent it in such a quality restaurant. Next time I'll have some fish or Mexican food. They have a nice variety but don't overwhelm you with to many choices. Price was adequate for the quality of food. I highly recommend reservations!",

The last straw was ordering a drink at the bar and there were flies all over the lemons, limes, olives. The bartender swipes at a fly on a lemon and then grabs the lemon and puts it in my drink and wants to charge me $11.00 for a gin martini with fly juice. Gross! Never again.",

The menu is imaginative, extremely well presented and very, very delicious. I had the Chimayo Chicken that came with acorn squash and a green chile potato and it was pure heaven. My wife had the Carne Adovada burrito and it was very tasty as well.  The red chile sauce was thick and lingering just as it should be. I highly recommend Richardson's for those of you who crave your New Mexican fix and those of you who have never had the pleasure.",

If you like New Mexico cuisine, this place is ground zero (White Sands reference intended).  For me, the Eggs Breakfast is nirvana, especially if I just finished a Sunday long run.  There's nothing like a big plate of eggs (over medium), pork medallions and hash browns to satisfy the hunger generated by a marathon training schedule.  Everyone from the valet staff to the servers to the cooks know us, because they're all here every time we come.  The lack of turnover is another sign of how well run this restaurant is.  Give it a try, you'll probably like it.  The love affair will come after a few visits....",

I came back as frequently as I could trying everything I could on their menu. As I have aged Richardson's has taught me that I don't need to be so damn adventurous. I mean I had to honestly ask myself do I really need all of the heart racing excitement of ordering the unknown, wondering if it is going to be any good. The honest answer here is when you find the perfect breakfast item at a place just roll with it. Richardson's Eggs Benedict Jalapeno is my breakfast soul-mate.",

I loved that it was dark and private with the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing softly over the speakers. The bar was packed and so was the dining room.   When you are an Arizona native you know that salsa is important - three salsa's were served: habanero, spicy pico and a mild (for the kid!). I ordered the blackened scallops with three dipping sauces, rice and beans. 2 thumbs up! My husband ordered the tasty Santa Fe chicken - lot's of flavor! The buttermilk ranch dressing is heavenly if you like that sort of thing.   Nice beer and wine list. They also have top dollar margarita that I plan to partake in after my pregnancy. We will be back! Maybe for breakfast?",

    "text": "******* 1 star service/ 4 star food ******  What a nightmare!!! What was supposed to be a birthday meal meal for a friend, quickly turned out to be a sideshow...  When we asked the waitress if the special of the night \"green chile pasta\" had seafood, she adamantly stated no. When asked what type of pasta it was made with she had no clue. She the proceeded to inch her way over to the next table of diners and poke them for the answer. After much debate the patrons determined it was a rice noodle. This was very uncomfortable for all parties.   2 of us received our meals. When Our birthday friend received his pasta special... It was decorated with shrimp. We specifically asked about seafood due to allergies and were told no seafood was included. When we advised our server that we could not accept the meal due to the seafood, she shrugged us off and said she would send over the waitress. Once the waitress arrived we explained the allergy situation again and advised her that this could not be eaten... Instead of apologizing for her error, she asked if we wanted them to \"remove\" the shrimp??? We stated to her that it would need to be remade. With some resistance she took the plate. 10 minutes later a shrimp free version arrived.  Our birthday guest had to wait 10 more minutes than we did to receive his food. We opted to eat our dishes, otherwise, we would have had cold dishes ourselves....  The total bill for this event was $ 154.00 + tax. I tipped the waitress $40.00 as a courtesy as I was advised she split tips with the busboy and server- who very polite and on point.  I proceeded to email Richardsons to advise of the experience. It has been 2 + weeks and not a word from this restaurant. I was not looking for anything except an apolgy and ownership for ruining a birthday celebration.  This restaurant is far from a 3 star service level... What a shame as the food is exceptional. Recognizing that the entire experience is key when charging $25.00 + price points for meal is a must in this competitive market.  Stick to Barrio Cafe as they have the formula for success down. I will never eat here again and route all co-workers, family and friends elsewhere.",

    "text": "My son and his fiance brought us and a friend here Saturday night for dinner. We had a reservation but arrived an hour early to sit at the bar for a drink. The hostess was pleasant (with beautiful light lilac colored hair) and said she could get us a table early, which she did within 20 minutes.   Our server was prompt, knowledgeable and very helpful. I am a vegetarian so I read menus whenever possible before my first visit to a restaurant. I knew going into this place that there wasn't a selection for vegetarians, but I held out hope that the there were sides not listed on the menu that I could have them put together for me, which they did.   We ordered appetizers - the roasted garlic plate was delicious! I didn't try the other appetizer plate that was primarily dead stuff, but everyone else said it was wonderful. For dinner I tasted one of their potato stuffed chilies and that was very tasty; I also had sauteed vegetables, rice and beans. I presume the rice was cooked on broth, but I didn't ask. The beans were really good, but very salty. Most restaurants salt the heck out of their beans, though, so I won't deduct for that. I turned my plate of food into 3 meals!   Everyone else at the table loved their entrees. They said their meat/seafood was cooked perfectly with the right amount of sauce/seasoning.   I must commend our server again, he was a young guy who couldn't have been more accommodating. I read reviews where service was the biggest issue for other customers. Fortunately, that was not our experience.   We will definitely eat here again.   Pros: Unique Ambiance - great place to bring a date Service Accommodating  Food was fresh, hot, good flavor Valet parking Charming/cozy patio seating Intimate indoor setting Wine selection  Cons: Very little vegetarian faire  Valet parking the only parking option A little on the pricey side",

Our dear friends recommended this place and were meeting us there, that is the only reason we stayed. We asked for self parking and they said to park at Runner's Den.... now I am wondering if they have an agreement with them or if they send people there just because. We sat and were welcomed by \"Absolutely no split plates\" and \"no separate checks\" notes on our menus. : ) Friendly business, uh? Our server was pushing for appetizers (asked multiple times before and after our friends arrived), but once we were ready to order she was nowhere to be seen for a while.  We also asked for straws and she gave them to us grabbing them from the top where your lips are supposed to go! I think that was by far the worse. Other than that she was OK and friendly. I do not know anything about New Mexico food but I do not have respect for places that spell adovada with a 'v', and that do not peel the green chiles : o Over all I thought the place was kind of 'uppity' for my taste (I am a very very simple gal), and I would at least have expected them to have options for artificial sweeteners, but they (oh surprise) only had the pink saccharine ones. OK, enough bickering : ) The food was good, the portions (other than the adovada) were generous and everyone agreed they were tasty. I think one of our friends had the New Mexico plate and it was huge. I am OK with the food, but for the prices they have I would expect excellent customer service and Stevia, Splenda or at least Nutrasweet. I am on a special diet but was even afraid to ask, lol...

    "text": "This place is definitely worth a try. My family and I came here for a nice hearty brunch and we were not disappointed.   All the dishes we tried were so flavorful. I tried the enchiladas: tried one cheese and one green chile pork. The green chile pork was my favorite. My husband had the carne adovada benedict. I will definitely order that next time. The meat was so tender and had a great smokiness to the red chile. The only downside to the meal was that all over our eggs were over cooked. I didn't send the eggs back but my father did and they were happy to give him eggs cooked to his liking. Overall, we were happy with our experience at Richardson's.  Also, just a heads up, they have valet. I'm not sure if they always have valet but they had it when we went.",

    "text": "Oh Richardson's, how I love thee. Once again you blow my mind and taste buds.   This has been my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years. I remember the first time I visited the the original restaurant and my frequent visits to the one of the three variations, always amazing. I love the little touches,  the gcp- green Chile potato, the way your dinner comes with a flour tortilla buried below sweet and spicy sauces and is just the right stuff to sop up every last ounce of flavor. The fresh tomatillo salsa and of course the green chiles found throughout. Tonight was once again fantastic and as I've never commented, I felt this time it was right.   We sat at the bar,  service was quick. Drinks delicious. Ordered tomatillo toast, roasted garlic and the taos combo- tonight the adovado quesadilla, bacon wrapped shrimp and new mexico sausages. Superb. Flavors are so on. Not just your typical southwestern restaurant by any stretch. I've never been to New Mexico and I can't comment on authenticity to their cuisine, but I can say the originality, combination, flavor burst, portion size are to die for. My friend was blown away. To quote...\"i wanted a quesadilla, but this is the best meal I've had in ages\", and yes it was. This place has been cooking for 20 some years, maybe more and still crushing it, for good reason: the food is unbelievable and the experience legit, not playbook. Take that sam fox.  Keep on being awesome Richardson. Still my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far.",

There were at least 4 open tables, the larger tables, but still they were open. The bartender and then the hostess were only willing to seat us at the bar since we were a party of two. We were looking for a sit down lunch in which we planned to eat and enjoy several drinks.  We walked out after realizing the staff had no desire to accommodate us or concern for losing a customer. We decided to go down to the Rokery to see if the attitude was different there. It was complete empty yet all the tables said reserved.  We asked the bartender if we could sit at a table. He had to excuse himself to go upstairs to ask permission. That was enough for us. There are too many good places to eat in Phoenix.  Oh by the way, until today we were loyal regulars to all three Richardson's restaurants.",

    "text": "Life changing, absolutely!  Finally made it out to Richardson's after hearing nothing but good things about this restaurant. Right as we walked up you could smell the amazingness, is that a word??? Who cares... because the aroma had nothing on the the way the food danced off my tongue. Such a cute dim room, perfect for a date night, and I have to say that I was very impressed the the music selection. I mean who doesn't want to hear great tunes while enjoying a meal. Anyway let's get down to the meal.  We ordered the New Mex con Queso, delicious! Great flavor not too spicy, fresh green chilies and spinach topped with Schreiner's Chorizo. The waiter asked if we had been there before and continued to tell us about their \"Signature Dishes\". I was already looking at the Pork Chop Chorizo when he sold me on the dish. For $27 you get a pretty decent size salad, fresh and crisp with jalopeno ranch. A side of Richardson's Famous Green Chili Potato, some mixed veggies and the glorious 14oz Pork Chop, double stacked stuffed with chorizo. This sits on top a large tortilla with beans, now you don't want to discard the base, you want it to soak up all the juices from the meat. I made sure to eat each bite of the chop with the beans and tortilla. Holy cow, was it marvelous. It arrives to the table in all it's glory on a silver platter, literally... my mouth dropped. I was not expecting anything of that size, and let me tell you about the icing on the cake or the chop for that matter...Mango Chutney. That definitely gave it the over the top, out of this world, better tan sex flavor...OMG heavenly!  Now, I do consider myself somewhat of foodie for sure...but I have to say, I have not had anything that amazing in a long time. I was expecting to have some great grub but I did not think I was going to come home still salivating over my dinner. Thank god I have more then half left over for lunch. This is for sure my new favorite place, can't wait to come back again. All in all the atmosphere, great wait staff, and quality of food, I give this gem 2 thumbs up! Richardson's I will see you soon.",

    "text": "Richardson's is New Mexican Cuisine and is similar to Mexican and Tex Mex but is slightly different. The Big Things here are the Potato stuffed green chile and the do you want Red or Green Chile Sauce question.  I tried the Santa Fe Chicken. It came out on a very large ornate silver platter. I have to say everything on my plate was delicious! The chicken was pecan grilled and was very moist and flavorful. It was topped with sauteed mushrooms and Jalapeno hollandaise sauce and served over tasty garlic toast. It was delicious as it was but I though it was shy with the jalapeno. I had my choice of side and went with the house specialty Potato stuffed Green Chile. It had some heat to it but not too much and was delicious. Also on my plate was a very large salad that was mostly cheese. For me it was WHEY too much cheese but the salad was fresh and lightly dressed with a very thin white dressing.  My husband tried the New Mexican Enchiladas. He had a trio of pork, chicken and beef Christmas Style with Red and Green Chile Sauce also filling the plate was rice and beans. He said everything was seasoned nice and everything tasted different and his plate was also very generous with LOTS OF CHEESE.  Based on this one exsperience the food seems solid but you'll need to cheddar a few pounds if you eat all the cheese.  You Cheddar believe it.",

If you've ever been to Richardson's patio and sat at the big table outside on a beautiful AZ evening or day, you know why I thought it would be nice to have the party there.   Well, I called 40days ahead of time to try and reserve the space. They will not speak with you about it on the phone and instruct you to email them with your request. So, I did. 25 days later, I'd not heard back from them so I called. I was told to email again. I did. Then 10days before my event,  I emailed again stating that I was very dissappointed that they hadn't replied and that I guess I'll find another venue. So I did. After all, if you're expecting to get a party of 15 at a nice table on a Saturday night during high season, you'd better plan ahead!   Literally, LITERALLY, the day before on Friday afternoon, they called me to see if I still wanted the table. LOL! Really!!?? As if I would have thought for one minute that that would come through and I'd be able to tell 15 guests on Friday night, where to be on Saturday night!   Clueless. Entitled. They have lost ALL perspective.",

Sunday brunch at Richardsons is my new go-to.  Also, the outside bar is a nice touch and the bartenders are always easy going and creative enough to make you speciality drinks. -I only say this because I am allergic to syrups, but they always seem to substitute the syrups without sacrificing the flavor so I am able to enjoy it!   Definitely get patio seating and ask for Max or Adam !!!! - best service from those two.",

After several attemps our party of three was finally sat. Our waitress gave us a couple of snide responses on menu questions   \"what's in your Mexican style ceviche?\"  \"Its just ceviche.\"  That's not helpful.  Turns out it is fish and shrimp with tomatoes, onion and jalapenos.    I explained my food allergy and she claimed the tacos were safe to eat after going off to check.  She did say they sometimes garnish with peppers but that it could be left off.  I ordered tacos and reminded her off my allergy.  I took one bite, swallowed a pepper and immediately reacted.  I was very sick the rest of the night and into this morning.  I had to run to the bathroom to avoid throwing up at the table.  The worst part is that the manager (i think his name was Frank) lied and said he had seen the ticket with the no peppers written on it! He later admitted to lying because it was not written on the ticket.  We had to force them to comp the meal we never ate (one appetizer and 1 order of tacos and 3 drinks that were never drunk).    This level of service is ridiculous!  I clearly explained my food allergy and asked about ingredients in order to enjoy a business dinner out of town.  The experience at this place and their handling of it was appalling.",

    "text": "After reading reviews on Richardson's, I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up on New Mexican fare and it is not an easy cuisine to perfect. I was also a little reluctant toward the menu as their vegetarian options seemed few and far between.   We visited the restaurant with another couple who are avid carnivores. We were pleasantly surprised to find something on the menu for everyone. My husband and I split the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The beans are vegetarian but the rice is not so in lieu of it, we were able to get a green chili potato (ridiculously tasty). The food was delightfully packed with heat -- the kind of heat that's cured by a bowl of ice cream or more of what caused the burn in the first place. It IS spicy so be sure to heed the warning on their menu. I dabbed my forehead with a napkin more than once.   To me, there's something about a server who knows her stuff. Our server was fantastic. We wanted for nothing during our entire experience and she knew exactly what was safe for us to eat as vegetarians.   I don't agree with others who think this place is overpriced. Our party of four had the same number of entrees, a bottle of wine, and two cocktails for $120. And yes, they only have valet parking. Welcome to any good restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to visit again and get my sweat on!",

    "text": "Went here with family for dinner last night as we had heard so much about this place. But I guess it was not a wise decision since we don't eat pork/beef and usually love to try the shrimp/ fish dishes so a word of caution for someone who is a pescatarian/ vegetarian.   We ordered phx donkey, prickly pear margarita and old fashioned to start with. The drinks were ok but nothing special about them ... so you won't miss much.   Ambience is nice however we were totally let down by the food itself, seriously not a single shrimp option in the menu. We started with an appetizer of pan seared salmon and it was too dry and totally over cooked. I guess we just ordered the wrong dish. We were planning to have the Mahi Mahi with mango salsa but after trying the salmon weren't sure if they made fish well. So we had a combination platter with chicken tamale instead. The beans and rice were nice but the tamale even though they had generous amount of meat were far from flavorful.   May be their pork dishes are good but if you don't eat pork/ beef not sure if there are enough options as the fish isn't cooked right. We had to leave and have a dessert later as this was a total let down, I would have expected little more attention to detail esp at three figure price tag. Their specials for the day were in 35-50 price range. We didn't bother as we weren't sure if they would be worth a try after the start we had here.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review because I've been an enthusiastic, raving fan of Richardson's for something close to 25 years now. It is hands down, IMO, the best brunch spot in Phoenix (as long as you enjoy a bit of heat/spice). It used to be on my top three places for lunch & dinner as well & over the years I'd say I probably eat at Richardson's 4-6 times per month.   Here's the rub. (1) I don't think I've seen Dick (owner) on site for over ten years. I'm sure he worked it hard over the years and I'm sure he deserves to do whatever he's doing with his time--but its not the same place without him; (2) as a dinner option, the pricing has gotten way out of control over the last few years. Decent (used to be great) quality steak entrees that used to be $28-$34 are now priced over $50 (which places it in competition with Mastros & other top steak places). Richardson's (as well as The Rokerij--both within the same building) doesn't hold up at that price point. Their awesome Sea bass entree is now around $55 or $60 (again, its great...but this isn't Ocean Club).   Richardson's used to be a fantastic, comfortable neighborhood spot with great food & drinks that was terrific, whether dining alone at the bar or at a table with a group. Now, it's become a place I'll only go on at company expense. Makes me sad. For the record, the problems I've mentioned are clearly reflected in the volume of customers. Five years ago, the place was jamming every night of the week. Now, its easy to get a table or place at the bar pretty much anytime. I suppose all good things must end at some point--but this one hurts.",

    "text": "This is a touch of class infused with New Mexican style cuisine. Steeped deep with Hatch Green Chilies and New Mexican/Southwestern flair, these dishes are well conceived and incredible. The flavors abound and melt in your mouth.  The dining areas are upscale even though the dress code is not. The outside bar at the Rokerij is a treat and lends easy access to either dining location. There are a wide array of draft beers on tap, as well as a fairly extensive wine list that is sure to please any palate.  Twyla and I had the New Mexican Enchiladas that were well prepared and delicious. These gems showcase just enough heat to keep you alert but not so much that your ordering milk with dinner. The dress is casual and the ambiance is intimate. This is great date place to sit, chat, enjoy vino and find out what a weirdo you met on Mingle; kidding! However, whether a special occasion, chilling with the crew or a night out with that certain someone, Richardson's and the RokeriJ will fit the bill nicely.

The atmosphere was very nice, that real comfortable feeling as you walk through with fireplaces, stonework and old wood work, romantic.  Unfortunately there are two reasons I give it such a low rating.  My wife and I go out with other couples all the time and we eat out 3-4 times per week, and I was shocked when the server said he cannot do a split check it was policy.  I understand for larger groups or a few singles together, but there only 4 of us, 2 couples so 2 checks, and I've never been anywhere ever that would not do this for two couples. He said there was no way he could do this it is not allowed.  Then after ordering a grilled shrimp appetizer, for $24, and it came out burned.  For these prices that plate should never have left the kitchen or the food runner should have noticed, so we had to send it back but it took so long to get the server back and our friends finished their appetizer so we just told them to cancel it.  The entree was good and no complaints for that.  For a very expensive place I was disappointed in the service and burned food.",

It's a good sized space inside, though there can be a wait during peak times. But they have a nice covered patio bar area where you can wait and grab a drink. The portions are huge. My wife and I shared the Carne Adovada and Chimayo Chicken, and probably had a full serving left over to take home. The Carne Adovada has a little kick to it with the red chili sauce, but the smoked pork is succulent and delicious. My wife thought the Chimayo Chicken was a bit too heavy for her liking, but I thought it was delicious. I'm looking forward to the leftovers :-)",

    "text": "I was in town for a conference and tried this place after reading the reviews.    We were greeted by the hostess quickly and waited at the bar for our table.  The bartender was attentive and served us a couple of drinks.  The ambiance is actually quite nice and cozy as folks have mentioned.  Our wait time to be seated was also about 40 minutes, so i would recommend coming when less busy or for happy hour and grabbing a seat at the bar.    The waitress seemed rather rushed and not attentive, as we had to ask for water.  Additionally, it was odd that the waitress did not even go over any of the daily specials noted on the chalkboards.  We ordered a fish taco special noted on the chalkboard and a relleno platter as well.  Both dishes were served rather late, after about 20 minutes of waiting.  The place was not really packed by the time we were seated.  The main courses were fair, but nothing really to write home about.  I was definitely expecting more.  We did try the flan, which was quite good.  The overall rating would have been three starts if our service was improved and the waitress took time to be more attentive and explain the menu items.",

They had never been to Richardson's before and so we were a little uneasy about whether they would like it as much as we do.  We arrived at 5:20 without reservations because for some reason I thought they didn't take reservations for under eight which they indeed do.  They take reservations for 4 and over.  Anyway, they seated us immediately but explained that our table had been reserved for 6:45 and would that work for us.  Yes, indeedy!!  Nabbed a great corner cozy booth!  One of the best in the house!!  As soon as we sat down we were served big glasses of ice water with lemon and asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  We had never ordered them before and they were really good.  They came warm, with a very flavorful guacamole, a salsa which tasted really great but was a little too warm for me and a couple other dips which I didn't try because I thought they'd be warmer than the salsa.   We ordered drinks - one Reisling, two house Margaritas and one Rob Roy on the Rocks.  Everyone was pleased with their libations!  Onto our dinner orders!   Two of us ordered the grilled shrimp pasta which was amazing!  I can't begin to guess how many calories were in that dish but it was so worth every bite and we both brought some home.  Our companions ordered two of their chicken items and were very pleased!    Our waiter was wonderful!  He was knowledgeable about the menu and spent time with us describing the various dishes.    They also have specials every night written on a chalkboard.  Lots of great sounding stuff, but oh my, that shrimp pasta was - ooh la la!  Will I be back?  Without a doubt if my chapter three in life lasts awhile longer!",

The guacamole was hot and this was before we added salsa, and our dinners consisting of enchiladas and chicken rellenos were inedible. The chiles overwhelmed all taste. We heard people at an adjacent table complaining about the over-spiced food, too. We think the chef may have gotten carried away with chiles.  That was all so disappointing since we had friends from out-of-town who we had told they were in for something special. We were right but also so wrong.",

I had always heard about the happy hour, but never caught it before.   Turns out that we were very lucky! During happy hour the small plates are $5, glasses of wine at $5, and draft beers at $5. This makes the place fairly reasonable. As for the food, we had Green Chili Sliders (outstanding), Carne Adovada Sliders (outstanding), Chicken Skewers (darn good), and Tostadas (crunchy and tasty). There are maybe 4 or 5 more things you can choose from.   The only hitch is you have to sit at the bar or in the cove (a closed in patio area). Small price to pay.  N*Joy...",

Fast forward to this past Saturday night when I took my family there. I'd heard mixed reviews but wanted to see for myself if they could still pull off the kind of meal I remembered. I was not disappointed!  I had the sea bass in an orange salsa that was prepared perfectly, along with their famous green chili potato. The other three in my party had fish - the fish trio, the salmon and the swordfish. All were cooked to perfection.  Add an appetizer of chips with fresh guacamole, pico, and two green sauces, one to set your hair on fire and you have the total package. Finally topped it off with the house made flan - absolutely delicious.   Richardson's definitely passed the test of time. I'll definitely be going back.",

    "text": "First time here and everything has a flavor profile that is very New Mexican authentic. The appetizer, the roasted garlic plate was a leap of faith for me as it sounded like nothing I would normally order but I was feeling a bit on the adventurous side. When it arrived I was not only surprised, my taste buds were blown away. I highly recommend the plate when you have about 4 of your friends or family to assist in taking that plate on. Now on to my main course, I opted for one of the specials of the night, a bone in prime with new Mexican Chile sauce and a cheese graded over it. Plus a sweet potatoes puree, twice baked in a poblano pepper along with a roasted vegetable medley that was equally agreeable. In a word \"delicious\" now on to the sweets and closer of the meal. Our choice was the flourless chocolate cake and a creme brule, both were fantastic and truly they both were standouts but we combined the two for a couple of spoonfuls and wow. Service was exceptional and the ice tea, yes just iced tea was also fresh brewed and all around I recommend eating here at least once in your life.",

At all. When we were taken to the table, the hostess just stared at the server and we stood there uncomfortably in silence for an oddly long period of time. We weren't offered the specials and had to ask about tamales, which were a special.  We were talking about how we felt like our presence was an inconvenience and I think someone overheard, because then the waitress started being nicer.

    "text": "My family went to Richardson's for dinner and it was the WORST dining experience any of us has EVER HAD.   I cannot believe that any good reviews of this restaurant are real. To start, the food was terrible. All the plates came out separately and my moms almost 15 minutes after everyone else's. Her meal had been over cooked for so long the food was burnt and stuck to the plate. The kitchen staff and our waiter had obviously forgotten about it. Our waiter had also forgotten to ring in appetizers on 2 separate occasions... the 2nd time the item never did make it to the table. When we told the waiter about my moms dinner he rolled his eyes and said \"it's supposed to be hot\" and then walked off while we were still talking to him. Next thing I know another staff member walks up and just starts clearing off everyone else's plate from the table without asking if anyone else was done...which we weren't. Then our waiter shows up again with the bill. DUDE... WHAT?   5 minutes later another guy comes up and asks: NOW are you done? I said no I wasn't and he responded --Well, I wasn't talking to YOU!! Needless to say everyone was beyond rude and has no business being in the customer service industry.   We all agreed that the staff is on drugs. I am not joking around when I say that. Their behavior and mannerisms were not normal. Oh and we all got the shits from the little food that we did eat. Having the runs while being hungry is the worst.",

Waitress didn't seem too knowledgeable about menu. There was an off duty employee or very known customer at the bar who along with the bartender and one of the waitresses dropped many \"F\" bombs. Hubby says \"everyone messes up at least once\". How do you fix that? I used to rave about coming here. After that experience I'm almost embarrassed to do so now.",

The wait staff and bar tenders were always professional and attentive, and the food was fresh and had rich flavors, as well as a chill energy. The downstairs bar was like a groovy cave, dimly lit and a din with chatter and music. Tonight was different: the wait staff fell far short of expectations, as did the food. The salad drenched in dressing, the fish -- fishy, and the pasta way short of al dente. Maybe it was a fluke, but it felt more like commercial TexMex in ambiance, disinterested service, and in a dull, super salty, and unhealthy cuisine. I hope management gets itself centered and focuses on doing things the right way. Too expensive to be disappointing.",

    "text": "Stopped in once again after a short hiatus and found the service to still be less than adequate. One feels like they're a bother asking for someone to take an order or get a refill because they're just so busy with preparations and waiting on tables. I don't believe it is the help's fault ...they all appear to do their best. But there is a genuine lack of any small talk or anyone asking you \"how did you enjoy your meal?, etc.\" I believe it must be the management that schedules too few employees. At any rate, the food still rocks and the pours are generous. Happy hour prices are competitive with an array of excellent menu choices. Pork & dirty rice, the chili rellenos w/ red or green sauce is amazing, but very spicy at times (especially if you order the red sauce). Their chicken, shrimp and beef skewers are amazing. Basically, you can't go wrong here.",

Everything was perfect as I expected.  The right amount of heat, spice, and temperature.  Too often foods are over or under spiced, or too salty, too cool.  I love it when they get it spot on.  Dining companions had the relleno platter and the Santa Fe chicken.  Everyone was pleased with their meals.    I did order the GCP (Green Chile Potato) .. It was good, but didn't blow my socks off as I had expected.  Don't get me wrong - I just won't order it as an additional side item.    Overall - kudos on a great meal and great service!",

So yeah,  they served us day old bread.  I didn't want a comp so I asked for a discount.  They gave me a $2.00 discount.   If you're gonna charge $18 for an appetizer,  serve fresh bread!!  Also,  there are mosquitoes flying around.  My girlfriend got bitten several times.  I've been to Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway quite often for many years.  I think my first visit to Richardson's was in the early 90s.  Today was certainly a disappointment.  Server was nice,  but seemed irritated that we complained.

The good flavors are diminished, the service is average at best and the music was loud and appropriate for a nightclub, or running a marathon but not for a candlelit dinner. If you are arriving from the north it is very difficult to make a safe left turn into the only entrance allowed by the valet.  We had arrived with big appetites knowing the food to be hearty. We were force fed an unappealing dose of wrestling on one of the distracting TV screens - definitely an ambience and appetite killer. We asked the waitress to turn the music down, she said she'd see. It didn't happen. Eventually we called for a manager. Mario was pleasant and changed the playlist. Apparently the owner dictates the music, which makes me think he's trying to win a new young crowd and neglect his stodgy older clients like me, a forty something. The waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu. There were two hostesses, one in training, and the trainer on her phone texting all evening. The halibut was dry. The Chimayo Chicken is no longer the standout dish it used to be. The signature jalapeno potato was bland, not even spicy this time. The lamb tacos arrived ten minutes after all the other main courses were delivered, with no apology. They had to be sent back, they were way too dry to be enjoyed. Lamb needs to be seriously over cooked to be so dry. The waitress took the dish back. She did not return with a counter offer from the chef, the manager did not appear to enquire about it. The lamb was included on the check. We paid and left and they have lost two families who have been long time customers.",

Both of us loved our entrees and truly I bet I'd be happy eating anything on the menu here. Everything has been so delicious here and at Dicks Hideaway.

Who knew the food scene in Phoenix was so hip and classy? They have really great food and the decor is super. Punched copper bar, adobe like ambiance, with a fire pit and outdoor seating that looks really cozy. New Mexican cuisine is one of my favorites so it already had me at hello. The menu is really classic mexican-ish with a tweek of gourmet. Such as Huevos Rancheros with Crab or what have you. We had blood orange juice, yum-, a Garlic Plate app. Was out of this world with roasted elephant garlic bulbs and several kind of cheeses melted over red and green fire roasted chile salsa and onions and little crustinis to use like a bruchetta I am guessing, which was clever. My Chile Relleno was really great, everything cooked perfect. Hubby got chile verde and eggs (forgive me I dont know the exact name of the dishes) he loved it. My brother and his girlfried said they havent had anything they didnt love. Its one of those places that makes you wanna stay a while...you can tell the owner really takes pride. I hope you go check this out when visiting Phoenix because its really worth the trip!",

If you get a combo you're in for a mix of meat/poultry/fish (your choice), beans, rice, cheese, diced tomatoes... the works. The cheese brings it all together and presto - you've got yourself one hell of a New Mexican meal =)  Three salsas served to start, one has a great kick.

That being said, we had very good service - not super attentive, but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering.  All our meals were correct and everything was prompt but not rushed.  We went on a Tuesday, which happens to be half price bottles of wine night, so that was a great surprise.  I ordered the Posole to start.  It was VERY spicy but delicious.  We also had the chips and guacomole, with the 3 different salsas, and that was wonderful to start.  My husband ordered the enchilada platter and his father ordered the New Mexico platter.  They both loved their food, although it was alsy very spicy (the particular green chiles in their sauce were very spicy at least).    My mother-in-law had the skewers and it was fine.  I had the Pasta Heidi: green chili pasta with chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I literally could have died right then and been satisfied.  It was SO.  GOOD.  We literally can't wait to go back just so we can have the Pasta Heidi again.  My mouth is watering.  YUM.    I would also recommend checking out the basement bar, just to have a drink.  Have your server or a hostess show you how to get down there.  It's pretty cool, and a nice place to spend some time while you wait for your table.",

    "text": "We sat at the bar since it was an early dinner. We ordered off the happy hour menu - pork sliders, queso and chips and ribs.  The sliders turned out to be the worst of the bunch.  The pulled pork was a bit dry and though the bun was nice, the whole thing was bland without some kind of sauce maybe.  The queso was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The ribs fell off the bone and the seasoning was pretty tasty despite the appearance of the dish.  The wine I had was very good, the margarita my friend had was super tangy but he enjoyed it.  All in all, I'd like to explore the menu further and maybe venture to the basement.  :)",

I have a gluten allergy and our server Nick was very helpful in finding out what I could and couldn't eat. He was super nice and patient with us-we kept having to ask for more time to order because everything looked so good haha!

    "text": "Wow. Do not dine here. Please let me list the reasons why...  Made a reservation three weeks in advance for a seven top reso for a bunch of Chicago 20 something's in town to go out and have a great night in Phoenix.  Our server was non existent throughout our entire dinner... Our plan was to dine... Translation, spend money! No one was served more than one cocktail. When asked what to order, we were answered with; everything is good. We relied on one girl who has been here before to walk us through the menu. Food came out staggered, and when the food arrived, we asked the food runner (who was clearly the rude host with short spiked boy hair) which entree had meat and which had cheese... (We had a vegetarian in the group) she responded with, \"I don't know, this is not my job\" Okay, really?! As we are all completely done with this place, and parched because our waters hadn't been refilled on the 90 degree patio. I thought that I should just let the manager know about how much money they lost out on, and more importantly how neglectful his sever was. His response; I wish you would have told me earlier so that I could have fixed it. (Mind you, our entrees were still on the table) No, I'm sorry, no, let me send you dessert. No, apology or care for my complaint in anyway.... Talk about one, the server. Two, the host/food runner. Three, the MANAGER... Dropping the ball! Needless to say, we will never be back. We have now wrote this review, so hopefully other people don't go here. And lastly, to whom ever reads this internally. Find a manager who values the customer... And get a training program in place for all your other staff members who interact with the people who pay your bills.",

Overall, I'd say the food was excellent, and I particularly liked the different salsas and other sauces they had. I put away a plate of tamales like there was no tomorrow! They made an off-menu burrito for dinner for one of us, and a very nice quesadilla for one of my children. All the dishes had a nice smoky, somewhat spicy taste, although I think they overdid it warning us about how spicy this were. Maybe they should come up with a scale to measure spicyness, like most other restaurants do.   Anyway, I liked the dark, cave-like interior and cozy booth seating - very nicely designed, and made for a nice atmosphere for dinner. Alas, the service was slow and indifferent, and I had the same gripe about tiny beers that are so expensive. We ordered a second round, which came in clearly much larger glasses, which made it feel even more like we were cheated on the first round. Also, the sodas my kids ordered were from syrup, and not mixed properly.   Overall, very nice atmosphere and food.",

I went with something called Chimayo chicken, which had sun-dried tomatoes, poblano, spinach, and asiago, along with some delicious veggies on the side, and a green chile potato, which was awesome.  There were quite a few things on the menu that looked good, so I'm sure I'll be back.  Oh, and I almost forgot - I ordered the sopapillas for dessert - best sopapillas I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, just the right amount of crispiness, drizzled with sweet honey. This would be enough of a reason to come back.",

After several not-great-not-terrible dinners, this last one was unfortunately worthy of review. From a server who pushed us 3x in the first 10 minutes to order when we'd already ordered appetizers and were enjoying wine and conversation, to tilapia swimming in a soupy, tasteless \"sauce\", to salads that arrived AFTER the main course, to an unopened bottle of wine left at the table with a broken cork, this was a sad and disappointing experience. The server eventually apologized for the wine, but not before pushing the broken, crumbly cork into the wine, capping it with the cork from the first bottle and offering it to us to take home. Almost $300 for a party of 4 to have this kind of experience? Unfortunately, we probably won't return unless we hear from many, many people that things have improved. Sniff.",

The next time we decided to try it for an early dinner but then decided to sit at the bar since happy hour is 5$ for appetizers(small plates). This is where the place really shines. The onion rings are the best I have had, The filet mignon skewers were excellent. The bacon wrapped shrimp were good but nothing to write about, but the prime ribsliders were top notch. We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.  Go at happy hour and sample some small plates.",

Horrible experience tonight as we made a reservation late for 6 p.m. and they said all they had was on their patio. I specifically asked if they had misters and they said YES. So off we went and when we were seated the misters weren't on, so we asked for them to be turned on. They did, but they they kept turning them off. When we continued to ask why they were off they said others where complaining they were dripping on them. The only other patrons were ones at the bar waiting for their inside tables. We had 6 people and our bill was almost $400. At the end the waitress asked how everything was and we asked for our check so we could leave as we were all VERY hot (misters were off for the last 30 minutes of our meal). She apologized and told us it was a \"liability\" to have the misters on and that someone had reserved the \"pit\" on the patin and paid $500 as a deposit and they didn't want the misters on. As we walked out of the restaurant and left a 15% tip instead of our normal 25% (she lost $30) we saw NO ONE else eating in the \"pit\" area, only 4 or 5 people standing around and the floor was completely dry. Very disappointed that we were told outside would have misters, which the few times they were on made a BIG difference and that the few bar patrons were more important than our table of six, with drinks, apps, $35 entrees. We will definitely rethink heading back to Richardson's after this experience no matter how good the food is.........since we had to take 50% of the food home as it was too uncomfortable to eat.",

We had questions about the menu, specials in particular, and she sulked off to bring us a chalk board as we couldn't see all of the ones on the walls.  She then left the table and didn't come back for a long time.  Once she did, she  stood at the tableside, chewing gum and jutting out one hip.  We were clearly boring her.  Questions asked of her were not audible in their response.  Never have is felt so embarrassed as my out of town company were very shocked and very disappointed.  Perhaps I could expect this treatment at Hooter's, but the total indifference was very very difficult.  If you get Diane, you might consider moving to another table and if she is chewing gum, it might be the same piece as she chomped on it the entire evening.  Very sad, indeed.",

However, I thought it would be nice to take him there tonight for his birthday. First, you can't make a reservation unless you have a party of four and as I discovered, there are no tables for two people. So when we got to the restaurant, there were no tables available and the bar was full, so we were offered a side bar area or outside sitting at a coffee table type area. Less than stellar choices for a birthday dinner. Finally, we got a couple seats at the bar. I ordered the Grouper with caper lemon butter sauce. Imagine my surprise when I received my dish and there were no capers. Everytime that I have had a caper sauce it has had capers in it. When I asked about it, they looked at me like I was crazy. Plus, all the sauce was absorbed by the tortilla on the plate. So I basically I paid $27 bucks for a dry Grouper with asparagus. My husband kind of liked his dish, but he was not overwhelmed. Yeah, the last time we will go there.",

Apparently that is no longer an option, so we decided to go to Richardsons. When we entered, we inquired about happy hour, which is only at the bar, so we chose to sit at a booth, instead, and skip happy hour. We ordered a round of margaritas and our entrees. The food was good, but, for some reason, was not kind to my stomach later. The service was so-so. I agree the waitstaff acts like they are way too busy to be bothered with doing their job. Our waitress was standoff-ish and absent. We had to ask one of the other workers for drinks and extras, like napkins, etc. The place was not busy, so I am not sure what happened to our server. We may return for a romantic cocktail or to bring guests for a drink, but that will be the extent of our return.",

    "text": "My husband, having lived in Phoenix for 40 years, has been a huge Richardson's fan. After the fire, we were both waiting for news of its reopening.  While driving  south on 16th street, I darn near gave myself whiplash when I saw a lovely building that said \"Richardson's\".  I texted my husband and 3 hours later, we walked in for dinner. The place was packed,and I had no idea what \"Rokery\" was.....Richardson's sister restaurant next door. This is where it gets confusing. While we were checking out the drop-dead gorgeous candlelit entry-patio, we were led to a table at Rokery .....not understanding why, not understanding the two-sided menu, etc. On the plus side, the booths are huge,  but I am not a fan of the open-kitchen concept because of the noise. Our booth was 8 feet from the bar and kitchen and conversing was impossible, and we there for a special occasion. It turns out that they serve both menus in either restaurant, with Rokery having an impressive fish-steak menu - which we will definitely return for. The daily specials - posted on a blackboard/wall was a small novel of offerings. We started with the Pomagranet margarita, which was very weak on the tequila. We ordered two of the Mexican entrees, which were very authentic and spicy. The only problem with my husband's plate was that it had been placed under a broiler and  the red chili sauce  had coagulated into a blackened, burnt- tasting flavor. Surprisingly, he didn't finish half of it......very unusual. My selection of the Mexican Platter was excellent, but could be delivered to the table at a temperature that is less than molten lava. It must have taken 15 minutes before it cooled enough to eat it. At any rate, the new location is beautiful, although when they welcome you, they need to tour and explain the two neighboring restaurants and the fact that you can order from both sides of the menu. I would love to give them the additional  stars the next time we visit.",

    "text": "This is what I have been missing from my life. If you like New Mexican...I mean authentic New Mexican cuisine then you certainly need to add Richardson's to the top of the list. It checks all the boxes; low light, a bunch of people crammed into a small area (I'm think about you El Patio in Albuquerque), massive portions of food, blue corn tortillas, amazing red and green sauce, and the list goes on. Sitting at the bar gives a direct line of sight to the kitchen, and a happening kitchen it is - open grill that is wood fried was the best part in my opinion. There is a nice outside patio, too. Lots of small wood fired fireplaces, and typical New Mexican adobe walls really gives this place an authentic and convivial feel. Plates come from the kitchen piping hot with very generous portion size; and to be honest the price you pay for the experience really is a good deal. If you have been to New Mexico then you know this place deserves nothing less than 5 stars. Bravo!",

We ordered many dishes including the enchiladas, burrito and eggs Benedict. Everyone was happy with their meal and I wish I would have had room For sopapillas. The flavors were great! I would have to say they used to much cheese and they don't have a vegetarian green Chile option for my burrito. I like green Chile and think they should have some diced or made without meat.  After living in New Mexico for 13 years, I would recommend this place as a good option for Phoenix.",

The quality of food is always the same, service is top notch and you get so much food there is always enough to take home for left overs. Oh, did I mention $6 Mimosas and Bloody Mary's.   I think we have tried almost everything on the menu. My favorite happens to be the breakfast tacos which are listed on the board. 4 tacos with eggs mixed with your choice of meat or veggies, hash browns and beans on the side. If you are going to be a first timer here, be forewarned, the red and green sauce can have a little heat to them.  Valet parking is complimentary and please, just tip the valets. They are fast and take good care of your cars.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.",

If you sit outside, it is almost unbearable due to the abundant amount of flies. I have come for happy hour a few time and they only do happy hour at the bar outside, so you are forced to sit in a swarm of flies.   The service here is also not very good and the servers are pretty inattentive.   I probably will pass next time I am invited to eat here, as I do not like flies all around me at anytime, in particular when I eat!   I went to another resturant in Phoenix that introduced a type of bee that does not sting people but it eats flies! Richardson's should look into this.",

He also highly recommended a dish which was the green chile stew.  OMG! Absolutely phenomenal experience so unlike anything I have tried before. More than just Southwestern cuisine, this spot offers prime steaks and seafood as well as a great selection of New Mexico style offerings. While I was tempted to try the tacos tenderloin or New Mexican surf & turf, I sTuck with the original plan and had the stew which is an off menu hidden gem.  This was absolutely not something that had been sitting around in a warmer all day. It must've taken 15 or 20 minutes to come out, and it's hard to get excited about stew, but this was the most incredibly flavorful stew I've ever had. There was not only depth of flair, but also heat from the various peppers they use that was just wonderful and not overbearing. I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes at this wonderful place.",

My personal favorite is rellenos and eggs with hash browns. I prefer cheese rellenos and these are stuffed full of tasty cheese and crisply battered. I get it \"Christmas style\" meaning with both green and red sauces. The red sauce is dark and flavorful and the green is bright and spicy. I love the pinto beans and tasty tortilla that is fresh soft and warm.  My wife likes the red chile pecan smoked pork, which has such a depth of flavor and a great mix of heat and smokiness.  The Wood fired pizzas are great, and like everything else, the portions are fantastic.   Only thing that keeps it out of the 5 is sometimes the service is slow as they seem understaffed. I really do like quiet places and this is wonderful for that, but I could use just a little more coverage.",

We stopped in around 9:30PM for dinner and found out that there was happy hour until close. I decided to indulge in the vast list of sliders. I opted for the steak and brie while my friend the salmon. Both versions were absolutely delicious. The steak and brie was a bit on the pricier side, at around $18, and the salmon was around the $12-15 range. The sliders were hefty, and although both plates left us full, I found the salmon to be slightly more bang for your buck, especially being that they were filled with huge chunks of salmon.   Overall a solid restaurant to enjoy food with friends and family. Would definitely stop in again if I ever found myself in the North Phoenix area!",

Great atmosphere and they have drink and appetizer specials after 9pm. I've visited about 5 to 7 times ( mostly dinner, a few late nights, and once for brunch) and each time, the food is outstanding. Some dishes are spicy. It can be pricey but it's so worth it, plus the portions are huge. You will not be disappointed,  there's a reason people drive from all over the valley to come here. Now, EAT!",

The mashed potato stuffed pepper is a must as well. Suggest dining inside though. The patio is great for a drink while waiting for a table.

As far as I'm concerned the individuals who rated this place \"average\" are some average joe's themselves. The ribs appetizer from this place was so tender and seasoned it was as if the me and the animal had shared a previous bond. This is the only place I've been to that the guacamole could be an actual dish in and of itself. The Chimayo Chicken(add Jalepeno hallandaise, you're welcome) was my entree of choice, and as you can tell from everything I've previously written it was knock your socks off and wash them for you; good. If they served the five stars I gave them, I would slap some jalapeno hollandaise on there and call it a meal.  Everything had just the right amount of spice to leave even the saltiest of critique's satisfied.",

There is NOTHING like good chile and it's near impossible to find after crossing the NM state line. The adovada and the shrimp enchiladas here meet the challenge!  ...So do the huevos rancheros.   Heck!   You really can't go wrong! (And,  YAY for $5 mimosas!)  And for dinner, my favorite is the pork tenderloin, moist and sweet, basted with a green and red chili jelly and the \"famous\" GCP (a chile stuffed with cheesy mashed potatoes and baked).  As much as I like the hip Dick's Hideaway location, I'm grateful for a greater shot at a table and the \"new\" Richardson's location just a smidge up the street.",

I ordered the Carne Adovada with Eggs; a huge plate with 3 eggs (mine over easy - is their any other way?), a huge chunk of smoked pork simmered in red chili, potatoes (or you can have hash browns), beans all served over a tortilla. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pork was fall apart fork tender smothered in a rich red chili that added great depth of flavor without overpowering the meat. The potatoes were large cut and good. A real delicious meal that went great with the house margarita.  My other friends each ordered something different, and they all looked really good, especially the Relleno Platter, which I was thinking about ordering before I decided on the Carne Adovada. In fact, there were many things on the menu that I would have liked to try - so much to try but only one lunch/day.  I really enjoyed this place and will seek it out again if I'm in the area.",

As such, we were overcharged for our meal, and they were not willing to discuss the misunderstanding.  Clyde, the \"manager\" is pathetic.  He has no authority or power to manage the restaurant.  I'm not sure why the owners would employ a manager who doesn't respect customers, but I can see why they have not given any decision-making authority to this hapless schmuck.  Under no circumstances should you go to Richardsons.  Best case scenario, you eat overpriced, low-end slop in a depressing setting.

We had issues with seating and service but, I was waiting on the food to determine my final opinion. I'm not impressed with the flavor at all. My mom and I had Chimayo Chicken. Asiago is great in moderation. The Chimayo Chicken is not only stuffed with Asiago but, also served on a BED of Asiago! The medley vegetables are...just...a weird combination and not cooked enough. I like my steamed veggies cooked until there is just a bit of crunch. These were way undercooked. The \"home of the green chile potato\" dish was very bland. I definitely expected more since it's a signature dish. Besides being bland it didn't look or taste fresh. It seemed reheated to me. If it wasn't reheated keep that in mind for the taste you expect. Just overall terrible really. Will never go back.",

I went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu, but the manager said, \"Let me take care of you- you're going to love this\". We looked at each other (date and I) and were like, \"Ok, I guess\".  The manager sent out a garlic plate. It wasn't the worst thing for a date, since roasted garlic isn't stinky, but it was a cheesy heavy gross mess for me. I'm not into that kind of food at all and would have much preferred to choose something different. It was huge as well, we couldn't even finish it and didn't have any room to try any entrees on the menu.   So, well, next time I know better and will stick to my own palate preferences rather than be persuaded by  a stranger that thinks first date food should be the size and style of a fancy superbowl platter. The dish wasn't gross, but it was incredibly heavy for 2 people. i might order that as an app if I was with a party of 4 or larger.  Overall, the place is beautiful and it's a great date spot.

    "text": "Oh Richardson's...you never cease to impress  me. I was there tonight for my mother's birthday with my brother, sister in law, niece & nephew & surprisingly enough, it was pretty dead. This was the first time I've been to the new location (hadn't been to the previous location in at least a year) and even though some lady came in & said \"OH it's so different but so similar\"..(doesn't make a whole lot of sense)...it looks pretty much identical to the previous location...cozy seating & all..pretty sure there's extra seating on the side as well.   The hostess was nice & sat us as soon as our full party was there. We started off with the chips & guac which was pretty fantastic (spicy as well but I love a good kick to my food) & the pinot noir which is fabulous...best pinot I've had in a while.   We then proceed to split the blackened salmon with pineapple salsa (my mother & I) with the mixed veggies & potato stuffed green chile & two side salads....two side salads were definitely not required...they're huge as are the portions typically served at Richardson's. It was delicious.  I'm not sure where previous Yelpers have noted they only have one dessert as we had not only the flan but the sopapillas as well which were prepared perfectly...not too doughy, not too tough. Absolutely great end to the meal.   Overall, great experience. The server was extremely patient with us as we requested things frequently & was laid back while being attentive at the same time.   If ya haven't been, go. It's a great atmosphere for a date & I can't wait to go back once the weather's cooled off to enjoy the patio.",

    "text": "We have been to this restaurant many times over the years and the food is usually pretty good, but not great. You also have to accept the inevitable explosive stomach pains the next day. It's spicy going in and just as spicy on the way out. From a hospitality standpoint, if I could give this place no stars for customer service and humility, I would.  They really make it apparent after a couple of times dining here that they think very highly of their menu, but in a bad, pretentious way. The wait staff are never overly warm and almost snoody. We thought this was just a fluke, but almost every time turned out to be the same experience. On our last experience, which was the straw that broke the camels back, our family officially swore off this place. Having out of town guests and being nearby to the restaurant, we wanted to let them experience this type of cuisine. We called in to check wait times and they told us come on in and that there was no wait. Upon getting there literally 5 minutes later and basically being obligated to park VIP, which in and of itself is totally ridiculous, the hostess asked if we had a reservation and then acted like I was crazy when I told her we were told to come right over. The restaurant wasn't even busy, but she told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait. We then requested a highchair, which they told us they do not have. Highchairs are not available inside or on the patio we were told, also known as \"children are not welcome\". Really?!? I mean, lets be real...there are a million other restaurants where I can choose to spend my money and introduce new people too. I will not be giving my service to a restaurant that does not take the effort to return it back to its customers.",

When we arrived a young man led us out to the patio and showed us to our seats. The atmosphere was nice but the table was so low it would have been hard to eat so we asked for another location. They had another outdoor table that was normal height and would work for our party.  They said they had a reservation for that already. Why not place the people that weren't there yet at the lower tables. They took us inside and sat us in a corner booth. The noise level was loud. We waited for the rest of my kids got there and we waited and waited for drinks. We then waited quite awhile for our food. Longer than is the normal time to expect. Even though we mentioned we had an infant they had no booster seats or high chairs.  Not even one. Our waiter said it has been mentioned before but no change. The booth sat in the corner and it was overly hot. As we were finishing our dinner and about to pay the air conditioner was turned on. So over all the service was mediocre. The food was hit and miss from dish to dish as some were good and some were not so. After paying the almost 300 dollar bill we oft and decided we wouldn't be back. Richardsons needs to listen more to their clientele on ways to make things better for all their customers. I DONT recommend this resturant for a lot of reasons.",

It had never been used and should have had $60 on it--the server came back and said it only had $18 when we were paying the bill.  My husband wanted to handle it discretely because we were with a group, so he paid the server and spoke with the \"manager\" (stupid--he should never have paid until this was resolved).    The guy who bought it pulled up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid $60 and we had never been in there--so there was definitely a \"mistake\" made by the employee who sold it.  The manager did not know what to do and said he would talk to their computer guy when he came in later--it's been 5 DAYS now and no resolution, not even a phone call from the manager to let us know he's on it.  We have had  to call several different managers who all play dumb. I'm sorry, but this is theft--selling an $18 gift card for $60--and poor management for not handling it seriously. Too bad because we had a great brunch but I don't trust the honesty or the competency of people there. DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  Update: Filed a complaint against this company with BBB and Attorney General's office.",

I had the enchilada plate and as i said it was good but did not stand out compared to other new Mexican enchiladas.  I liked the salsa a lot but the chips were pretty oily. I would go again if someone I know wants to go there - but it it is not high up on my list for a repeat visit - -  overall, the food did not overwhelm me and for Mexican/New Mexican the price was a bit high.

His pants then became wet and when we told the waiter she just said sorry and took the whole cushion/pillows off. We had a sleeping baby in the car seat carrier and the waitress was pretty loud which woke her up. I know it wasn't really her fault really but that made me a little annoyed since I had to hold the baby the entire time now instead of enjoying my meal. It took a little for the food to get there and refills weren't very often. Had to ask her twice for another sprite. The food itself was okay. We came during brunch so maybe if we come during lunch or dinner and try out the menu things might change but the brunch/breakfast wasn't worth it for me.

I really wish our experience was better as the reviews below suggest its a decent place, but we will not be back. For the money you spend here you can get a great meal with EXCELLENT service down the road. Usually if the food was not to par but service was good we return for a second try- as every kitchen has an off day. But Misty sealed the deal for us. Management needs to rethink that one.",

    "text": "STAY AWAY - The food has an amazing flavor and the restaurants offers a unique atmosphere.  However, the restaurant is located in a terrible spot along the main road.  The parking situation is so limited with poor entry signage in fine print.  It can get one feeling very agitated and frustrated.  The valet staff was blasting cars out of the driveway and I would not want them parking my vehicle.  I can park my own vehicle but, there is not much place to park.  Once we got thru the obstacle course and made it into the compound things went more sour.  The hostess seemed excited to quote 45 minute wait at Richardson's and sent us over to check at Rokerij with a longer wait of an hour. Imagine that, all on a Tuesday night. It wasn't even a weekend. I know it says something for the food.  Although, it isn't that large of a place.   In any case, we all just left and went somewhere else.  As a result, I found a great taco shop with great service.  This isn't the first time I've been to Richardson's where I encountered this type of situation but, this is the first time I decided I should write about it.  I was not real pleased with the way the hostess and staff interacted.  Richardson's staff seem to think it is a privilege for me to eat at the establishment and give my business.  In any case, I left dissatisfied and very hungry.  Lets just say I would not go out of my way to recommed this place.  I would recommend Richardson's if you can make reservations and walk there or if you don't mind waiting an hour and half to be seated for dinner.  Perhaps some people are more lucky with better service.  If you are visiting there anyway, maybe try going early.  As I mentioned, the food is amazing but, the service experience might not be so great.  You might even get bad table service from a snotty server like I did on a previous visit a few months back. I gave Richardson's several months before I decided to return back and now this. Now, I'm really not in a hurry to return.  Well they probably won't miss the business anyway.  Did anyone else notice it took some other yelp reviewer people up to 11 years to return?  I wonder why?   If you read this and decide to visit anyway,  maybe you'll have better luck than I have.  If not,  don't say I did not warn you. Good Luck!",

The enchiladas and rellenos were out of the world !!! All I wanted in life at that moment ! I also tried the carne adovada and cordon bleu, they were very good also. We had the skewers thinking that were like the rokerij version, but they weren't, still good though. We finished with the flan and sopapillas. The flan was really good. I am not crazy about flan, but I really enjoyed theirs. The sopapillas were good, not authentic, but still very good.

    "text": "Not the best experience for at this chain of restaurants. It was our first time back to Richardson's new building and we were there for lunch. It looks just the same on the inside, complete with the horrible step up as you head left after entering the restaurant. C'mon guys, you couldn't have put in a ramp? Two people tripped on that step as we were having our brunch. We were at the first table as you walk in to the left, right next the the fireplace. Unfortunately, I don't think they had the thing set up right because we were blown with ash at one point.   We got the eggs benedict jalapeno to share because the plates are usually so large. It was plenty of food, but not stellar. The english muffin was cut so the bottom was so thin that it got soggy and flimsy with the jalapeno hollandaise. The meat was supposed to be pork loin, but we were served a big piece of thin ham. Yes, I understand pork and ham are the same animal, but what we got was not pork loin. It was a much cheaper version. For $15 I was not happy. I was happy we didn't each order a dish and get completely ripped off.   The service was not great but I chalked it up to our waitress not having a good day. She came by after we waited nearly 10 minutes to get our drink order and we tried to put in our food order, but she walked away as we trying to say \"and then...\". She also refilled my coffee without asking if I'd like more (my personal pet peeve). I just hate it when the automatically pour in more coffee when my cup isn't even half empty. I have the sugar/cream proportion perfectly set to my taste and you just threw it off because you swooped in and didn't ask. Grrr. She did this twice. I had food in my mouth the second time and don't like to throw up a hand (I think it's rude). Grrrrrrr.   Last oddity was the fact that the charge shows up as \"burningembers\". I couldn't figure it out for a few minutes before it finally hit me. You know, because they keep burning down their restaurants. Bet their insurance is a doosey.",

    "text": "My friend invited me for lunch with friends since I know my New Mexican food and  amazingly, I haven't been here yet after a decade in the valley. I judge every New Mexican restaurant by their carne adovada, the signature dish of northern New Mexico besides the green chile cheeseburger and sopapilla.  Sitting outsude is a choice to be weighted heavily given the weather. Nice for evenings but not for lunch in the summer unless you're under the misters. You might THINK you'll be OK in the shade... We ate outside on the patio for Sunday lunch.  Anyway service was nice but somewhat inefficient. The beertaps were 10 feet away but our server went inside, I guess to add the order as well as have it filled. It took a while to bring back the incorrect beer. Anchor Steam and Lagunitas IPA are the saving graces for beer. Anchor Steam was served at first in a Hoegaarten 330ml glass.  This is UNDER 12 ounces for $5.75.  UNACCEPTABLE. Don't accept the \"premium beer\" line, get a big boy glass. My next one I asked for a big boy glass. I tried my friend's bloody mary and it tasted totally righteous - this isn't a mellow V-8 tomato soup pillow! Garnishes vary, you might get a mushroom, you might get a celery stick...  Our appetizer was served without silverware or napkins. Asked for silverware from manager.  My main was carne adovada with eggs. The plate had an excellent eye appeal and was served extremely hot. You'll need to be prepared for this as all hot plates are served ON A HOT METAL PLATE. BEWARE. You're warned by me as well as the server.  So how was the carne adovada? Not technically accurate or traditional. The meat was smoked (they have a smoker and a woodpile out back), and this is not usually done in New Mexico - the pork is usually marinated overnight before being slow cooked for several hours and the fat rendered out. Here at Richardson's not all the fat was rendered out and this made for some sort of funk in one bite, and the smoke flavor was to the point of ashtray on another few bites. Mean and in between though was a nice smoky style to the carne adovada but it seemed overpowering.  Good CA has a depth of flavor in the red chile sauce with the other ingredients.   It also came with beans and the flavor was great and out of the ordinary. The potatoes were plain and so were the scrambled eggs (eggs are made to order, you don't HAVE to get scrambled.)  I guess we have to sit inside for decent and accurate service, but I'll give another dish a chance.",

    "text": "I had lunch here one afternoon when it was surprisingly not crowded. I am giving four stars for an always cozy atmosphere and a nice patio.  I had the enchiladas which had a nice kick, especially the pork. But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me. Everything is good but not great enough to warrant the prices. And the service is almost always lacking.  This particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries. Not always the case as some servers make it clear that they are way above looking after the likes of us.  So overall, not a bad place, the prices, quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this is my first negative review of a restaurant. New to the Phoenix area, my husband and I went to Richardson's yesterday evening, per our hotel concierge's recommendation.  We ordered drinks, appetizers, and two main courses. I tried the Carne Asada Pizza, and after the first bite, I could barely take another. It was UNBELIEVABLY spicy (the meat was fine, but the pizza sauce was not). It completely ruined the flavor and taste of the pizza - and the over-seasoning of the sauce made it completely inedible. I'm even tolerant towards spicy food and enjoy most meals 'with a kick', but this entree had a BOOT of ruined spicy flavor - and I'm now convinced there was a mistake in the kitchen with over-seasoning/peppering the plate, which I understand can happen on occasion. I tried a few more bites, hoping I had just gotten a flick of habanero pepper, but each subsequent bite was just as bad, TOO hot. My husband could tell I was struggling (ie eyes watering, guzzling water, lips on fire), so I offered a bite to him, to see if my judgement was skewed, and after he tasted, he said 'no, you're right! It's like 'burn a hole in your stomach spicy'!'  And this is when our experience turned for the worse. I've never had to tell a server that I can't eat a plate because it's too spicy, but I respectfully pulled ours aside, and informed her of the situation. I thought she'd be more understanding and would offer to send the dish back and simply have it re-cooked, with less spice. But all she offered me, was a quick, 'I'm sorry.... can I bring you some sour cream?' She explained that the sauce was made like that and never offered to fix the dish (or inform the cook) - but merely asked if I wanted to order something else. After I told her, 'no, I don't need sour cream (which would not have fixed the dish regardless) nor did I want to order (and wait) for another entree,' she took my completely uneaten plate, and the WORST part, brought the check, fully charging us for the pizza (which hadn't been touched, minus the few small, trial bites). It wasn't worth arguing about, but we were most disappointed with the service and the handling of the situation (the server/restaurant could have simply comped the pizza, right?!). While the ambiance of Richardson's (and all other food we tried) was great, we wish they could have better handled the situation of a seriously bad plate. For this, we will never return or recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "SHORT VERSION:  MAJOR disappointment tonight.    Just paid $52 for 2 Pasta Heidi's (online menu says $22 each but they are now $24 each) from \"Richardson's\" when the EXACT SAME ITEM at \"Rokerij\" is $18.  Received horrendous service from Richardson's tonight.  FULL VERSION:  First off, it really kills me to write this.  My husband and I loved this place and met here often for dinner after work.  It's been a gem for us but I'm not sure we will go back after tonight.  My husband ordered 2 Pasta Heidi's to go tonight for our dinner tonight.  Nothing else.  No sides, no drinks, nada.   It's pretty far out of our way for a to-go order (from our house) but we were craving this delicious dish from Richardson's/Rokerij big time so we were more than willing to make the trek.  However, when my husband was about to sign for the bill, he noticed something felt off.  It was much more expensive than we normally pay.  He asked if the prices went up and the gal mentioned she wasn't sure, but that maybe it was because we had called the Richardson's phone number and not the Rokerij number. He then went to the Rokerij side and checked out their menu.   Mind you, as many people who eat here know, there is a lot of carry over between the two.  In essence you can order many of the same items from one vs the other.  Heck, they even use the same font and menu layout!  Sure enough, he was right.  There was a $6 price difference for the exact same item.  He asked about it and a male server said they had just had this conversation with management last week because it doesn't make any sense and people have mentioned it.   My husband then walked back over to the Richardson's side and asked to speak to someone about it since it must just be a mistake.  Our meal was literally $12 more at Richardson's for no real reason.    After explaining the issue with the lady he was directed to (wish we had gotten her name) all she said \"I don't know anything about that\" and that \"it is what it is\" with a very condescending tone.  She neglected to offer any assistance to explore or amend the issue and smugly shrugged at him like he was crazy.  For the record, if this were a mere couple dollar difference we wouldn't have bothered, but $12 is a pretty big difference.  At the end of the day our experience was a seasoned patron's nightmare and it breaks my heart to share this story.  If you absolutely must have the Pasta Heidi, save yourself some frustration and money by ordering it at Rokerij.  Please see my photos for proof.  Both are menu screen caps from their website.   Both documents are dated 6.30.14, which indicates this is an issue they've probably known about for a while and haven't bothered to correct.",

Everyone raved about the food.... Well, except two young people who thought the food was spicey. Their server was on top of it and got them both something to satisfy their taste buds The wait staff and management were fantastic.   The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5? Because of the poor follow through/communication. I worked with one  office staff for scheduling. The first impression was great but her follow thruogh was minimal to non existent at times. Finally, after 2 weeks of no communication (3 weeks til the wedding) I complained! To everyone who would listen. I even posted on Yelp. The next day I got a call and a text.  After all is said and done...I am grateful all worked out in the end. Regardless of all the bumpy couple of weeks. Richardson is the bomb and worth your patronage!",

I have been dining here since I was a young girl (...it is one of my dad's favorites) and have ALWAYS loved their delicious house salad! Last night, I told my boyfriend that I hadn't been in years and wanted to check it out again on our date night! Not much has changed, it is still the same dark and cozy atmosphere! And yup, the salad was just as delicious! This time I ordered it with beef tenderloin and the meat was marinated and cooked to perfection! We also split the queso dip with chorizo as an appetizer and it was fantastic. The house margarita was not the best marg that i've ever had but it did the trick. You should also know that it IS a little pricey. I was actually pretty shocked by some of the entree prices but if you stick with the basic meals (enchiladas, burgers, etc.), you can order a plate under $25. I'm sure we'll be back with family again soon!",

The only thing that was decent was the guac and I'm sure that is because it's pretty hard to mess up something as delicious as an avocado, unless you add too much salt. We were a big party (like 20 of us) so we all tried each other's food. I was not impressed with even one dish. I am used to super authentic Mexican food so that could be why, but either way, I was super unimpressed and won't be returning.",

Upon entry, I was surprised to see a unique setup and design of the restaurant. It's not very often that you enter a restaurant and get curious to look around. I plan to return just to visit the different areas.   My client and I ordered a guacamole appetizer to snack on and I went with the New Mexico Enchiladas for my entree (choice of three: vegetable, green chile pork, chicken, grilled shrimp, beef, cheese, or smoked turkey, served with rice & beans, with choice of red or green chile). Let me tell you, the enchiladas were incredible! I like to eat and believe that I can put down some food...no joke, I had two full meals worth of food from the one entree. Their portions of food are very generous! Reason for the 4-stars was my business client did not receive the side salad that was ordered.  I look forward to returning for another outing to enjoy more delicious drinks, food and explore the property more!",

Ok so it must be a smaller number, but enough to have gained a few lbs from their always delicious and always ample grub.     This also happens to be my (now) 19 y/o daughter's favorite restaurant in Phoenix and this is probably the 3rd year in a row we've had a birthday meal here.  This time since it was a workday, the girls came up and met me for lunch, which gave us the opportunity to enjoy items off the brunch menu (served till 4pm daily!).  We started with the (chorizo) Con Queso, which was amazeballs.      I had the Carne Adovada Benedict, which was one of the best bennies I've ever had, with pork that was super tender and flavorful soaked in their jalapeno hollandaise and, True to form, totally massive.  Two others had varying enchilada dishes, which they raved about, and another had the Huevos Rancheros, which she raved about as well.    Oldest daughter had a Prickly Pear Margarita which made her eyes go wide with enjoyment when she first tasted.  Winning!    Finally, our server brought our 19 y/o a trio of birthday mini-desserts - a cheesecake-in-a-pot (consistency of a pot de creme with the flavor of a cheesecake), a dense flourless chocolate cake and a creme brulee.  The brulee was her favorite.    We had good service and a good time!  Thanks again Richardson's!",

    "text": "They say Richardson's is an institution, and I was looking for a place that was a little more upscale to take my friends to dinner as a special treat. I admit the venue is terrific and you can opt to sit in a cozy booth inside, or switch it up and sit on their covered patio (or is it a veranda/). We came on a Monday night and it was pretty relaxed - not so busy that I felt pressured. I wanted to have a relaxing dinner, so that suited me.  But food wise? I was not impressed. The best part of our meal was the fried asparagus - but, really, even a flip-flop dusted in panko crumbs and deep fried tastes good.  Two guesses as to what I ordered. Yup, that's right, the salmon. It came with their legendary green chile potato and brussel sprouts. The salmon featured a blueberry jalapeno salsa. We also ordered the pork mole and the chicken cordon bleu. The portions are huge. The mole plate would have fed the 3 of us and still created leftovers! My plate must have held a good 1/2 lb. of brussel sprouts. And I like brussel sprouts (that's in fact why I ordered them), but these were the kind my mom used to force us kids to eat back in the days before chefs figured out how to romantically roast slivers of sprouts so they're slightly charred, sweet and crisp. So...these big ole' babies got pushed to the side. As did the blueberry salsa which, on its face, seems amazing. But instead of adding a bit of heat to soften the blueberries and meld the flavors, or a bit of sugar to help bring out some of the juices, this salsa was just whole blueberries that kept sliding off the top of my salmon. Finally, what the heck is the cult fascination with this green chile potato concoction? I found it to be bland and not very interesting. Mashed potato (with maybe a bit of chile powder for color?) stuffed in a green chile - I'd rather have amazing mashed taters made with bits of hatch green chile with a really lovely gruyere or similar. Are you getting the impression that I didn't find the food that interesting, especially for the price point?  I know I'm in the minority. Everyone loves this place and in fairness, it does deserve to be on the list of Phoenix restaurants that have made an impact on the culinary scene. I think my next visit will be for happy hour. And you, fair-minded Yelper, should come and check it out yourself and make your own determination. Order those asparagus frites. And bring an appetite!",

    "text": "OH, RICHARDSONS!!!  You broke my heart!  After 2 wonderful, memorable \"home-run\"  experiences in the past, I bring my family to share good times and brag on you...and YOU LET ME DOWN...BADLY!!    Before arriving in Phoenix this weekend,   I learned though that the old Richardsons burned down but another \"sister\" restaurant \"Rokerij\" was serving the Richardsons menu.  I thought that's cool!  I am sorry to say that this time, it was a MAJOR FUMBLE.  I don't think a restaurant has ever disappointed me like Richardsons or Rokerij (or whatever they call themselves\".    I ordered one of their blackboard special entrees of the day:  Sea bass encrusted in pine-nuts.  The waitress told me I could have either mashed potatoe baked in a half of a jalapeno, or I could have plain mash potatoes.  I chose the plain mash potatoes since I cannot eat jalapeno.  My husband (who is trying to go vegan) ordered the calamari entree salad.    My son ordered the pastole soup and a BBQ chicken pizza.  Past 2 experiences at Richardsons:  we were always served chips and salsa when we sat down.   This time:  no chips and salsa.   So, we ordered some.  we didn't get it for 15 to 20 minutes.  (And they charged us.)  My son was served his Pastole soup at the same time as the pizza, not ahead of the pizza.  That was odd.  Then when he started eating the pizza, it was not the pizza he ordered.  It was a plain feta cheese pizza, not BBQ chicken.  My husband's salad tasted bitter...my husband said he thought the lettuce did not taste fresh.    As for MY entree, it was served about 10 minutes AFTER my family received their food.  AWKWARD!!  My son and husband didn't feel comfortable eating their dinner when I sat there with nothing (except chips).  When my entree finally arrived, it had the wrong potato...the one I didn't order...the one with the jalapeno green pepper...not the plain mashed potato.  Also, the pine-nut encrusted sea bass didn't look like it had any pine-nuts.  I wouldn't have ever guessed that there was a shred of pine nut associated with that fish.  So, I inquired and was told that just because it said it was encrusted with pine nuts doesn't mean that it would be covered with pine-nuts...it was supposed to be a \"dusting\".    It was clear by this time,. we were having major problems with our dining experience.  I thought, this can't be the same Richardsons I remembered from the past.    The waitress was \"busy\" and my husband went in search of the manager at the front of the restaurant.  He was in the middle of explaining the problem to the manager when the phone rang...the manager told my husband he had to take the call and my husband was just left standing there.   (Oh, really??  You interrupt a customer standing in front of you telling you about a service issue to take a phone call?)  My husband is a good sport and he waited and then continued to expalin the problem.    Some minutes later, the manager appeared at our table with the plain mashed potatoes.  As he served me the potatoes, he blurted out that \"I wasn't really supposed to get a choice of potato in the first place, since I was ordering off the Richardsons menu\".  (Recall the waitress gave me the option...I didn't ask for the option.  I didn't know what menu I was ordering off of...how am I supposed to know?) Is the manager actually telling  the customer that she shouldn't have gotten what they offered.  (OH REALLY??)  My husband explained then that the waitress had offered it.  Reply:  \"She wasn't supposed to.\"  (OH, DEAR! WHAT'S A CUSTOMER SUPPOSED TO DO!)    So, in summary:  most of what COULD  have gone wrong at Richardsons DID: 1)  Chips and salsa (I guess not offered to patrons complimentary anymore).   We requested them and were charged the $5...alright, I can pay for the chips.  It's just odd they don't offfer this anymore.  AND why did it take 20 minutes to get chips and salsa?? 2)  My husband's salad did not taste fresh.  Poor guy...he had his hands full trying to voice his concern to the manager about my meal and my son's and his wasn't right either! 3)  My son's pizza:  they served him the wrong one.  Shouldn't the waitress be checking the order for accuracy before serving it?? 4) My son's soup wasn't served before the pizza.  So he has pizza and soup served at the same time.  Maybe the waitress could have asked if he wanted the soup before or with the pizza.  We thought it would come before.  (ASSUME NOTHING AT THIS PLACE!) 5)  My mashed potato:  offered an option, served the option I didn't pick, then told by the manager that i shouldn't have had the option in the first place.  (JEESH!)   By the way, the table next to us also had terrible service.  We overheard the waitress ask the patrons when they were asking for their check, \"Did you ever get the beer you ordered?\"  (DOESN'T SHE EVEN KNOW??)    As stated before, I have experienced much better at Richardsons previously.  They should be embarrassed!!!!",

We sat at the gorgeous Bar ... Philip was our Bartender/Server,  what a great guy, the food was spot on ... I am Vegan, Philip made it happen with his great recommendations ... At the end of meal,  Philip gave us a tour of the downstairs bar  It is So awesome!!!  My cousin was so impressed  I hope to be back soon   Thank you Philip for making our night complete   Dawn and Rob",

    "text": "This place doesn't understand how to fix a bad situation.  Our friends got us a $50 gift card for Richardsons/Dicks/Rockerji for our wedding.  Two weeks later we went in for brunch at Richardsons, and were told there was only 18 dollars on it.  The manager said there was nothing they could do, but he'd look into it and get back with us. We heard nothing.  Two days later we called, and another manager said he knew nothing about this but would research it.  We heard nothing.  Again, we called and a third manager said it was the first time he heard of this and would look into it.  Finally someone called back and said they'd make it right - come on in and have dinner on them.   A day later someone calls and says the card was used a week after we got the card at Dick's Hideaway on a Monday (we have kids and haven't gone out on a Monday in years), but they'd still make it right.  We asked them if they had any video footage, because we didn't use the card, and would like to help them get to the bottom of this.  They never responded to this request, but said come in and we will make it right.   We decided to come in and take up their offer, only to be told the owner told the managers not to honor it.   A)it's concerning that they don't care that their gift cards are faulty or someone is stealing from them internally, and B) it's amazing that they decided not to make this right and fight us on this over $32.00.  UPDATE: After involving the BBB and the AG's office, they finally refunded the disputed amount.",

The atmosphere is lovely, though a bit cramped. I think it would be nice to sit outside near the fire in the cooler months.  The food was good - not outstanding, but good. The seafood was fresh. Don't plan on dessert unless you like flan, since that is the only dessert on the menu. The wine and cocktails were pretty good as well.  What was awful was the service. Our waitress acted like serving our table was an inconvenience. And it wasn't just her - at one point, before we paid our bill and while we were still talking, someone came over to our table, took our wine glasses and our placemats. We all stopped talking and looked at him. It was obvious they wanted us to leave so they could turn the table. I'll stick with Rokerij from now on!",

On the plus side, they offer a number of seafood dishes, and know how to properly cook fish.    It was relaxed and the service at the bar was good.

I felt like I needed to give them a shout out for their awesome work and for always making mine and my husband's dining experience here amazing hence why we continue coming back. I should try different items but we always end up getting the same thing every time. This place is great for brunch, lunch and dinner. For brunch I always get the enchiladas and eggs. I usually get the beef and cheese enchiladas and it's served w eggs and hash browns. It's HUGE so plan on taking a lot of it home w you... or share it. Also, you can choose from the dinner menu for brunch if you want... And my go to for dinner is the New Mexico Enchiladas (yes I luv enchiladas!!). I usually pick 2 beef and 1 shrimp or 1 chicken. The shredded beef inside the enchiladas are the best! And it comes w rice n beans but I opt out the beans for extra rice. And I always get the red and green sauce combo!! How can I choose btwn the 2?? My husband always gets the garlic shrimp pasta minus the avocado (he has an allergy to avocado! I kno so sad!!). This comes w a tri-colored rotelle pasta in a garlic cream sauce w jumbo shrimp which I always steal a couple from him! It's absolutely delicious!! Overall, I highly recommend this place!! Oh and if you want to watch sports, sit in the outdoor patio in front of the bar!",

Very helpful in guiding us through the menu and making sure we tried the top Dishes. The tostadas, quesadilla, enchiladas, and pork abodabo were all awesome. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs - but we got plenty to take home for leftovers.",

    "text": "A New Mexican restaurant in AZ? This made me think of my best friend who lives in NM. =)  I came here with a friend last night for dinner since she's been dying to come here. I think everything deserves a four star. I ordered the Pasta Hedi which was amazingly delicious! It's a pasta that comes with chicken on top of a tortilla. The sauce was sooooo yummy. I'm really into pasta so I really loved it. It also comes with a house salad which I thought was really good and very good size portion. I had to split it with my friend. We washed everything down with margaritas. I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita which definitely satisfied me after a long day..You have to try it!   The service was also very good. Our server always came back to make sure everything was to our liking. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well. It's a great date spot.  The only reason it doesn't get a four star from me is because it's a bit pricey. Between the both of us with our entrees and drinks the bill came out to about $60. That and it's pretty far from me. I wish there was one on my side of town. But you get what you pay for!   I'll definitely be coming back for that pasta and margarita again! Plus their brunch menu also looks beyond yummy and something that I'd like to try out. =)",

We ate at the bar serviced by an exceptional bartender.  The Hendrick's gin and tonic was cold and perfectly poured and the buttery Chardonnay by Landmark was an excellent suggestion. My husband had the Tortilla crusted halibut, and I selected the Pine nut crusted sea bass. The fish was a generous cut that was served at the perfect temperature - the sea bass was flaky and soft while the halibut was tender and firm. The sides were equally delicious with the right touch of Southwestern heat.   Perfect ambiance. Service was excellent and on point. The food innovative and delicious - a 5 star evening!",

Love that they offer $6 glasses of wine for happy hour at the tables as well as the bar - I enjoyed a lovely Silverado Sauvignon Blanc.  We shared the spinach queso, green chile pork tamale, chicken, beef, shrimp and sausage skewers over rice and pinto beans and the shrimp and scallop pasta with a side salad.  We definitely overdid it, but couldn't decide what NOT to have...tough problem, right?  After dinner we went to the cellar bar at the Rokerij...perfect way to end an evening on a hot summer day!",

    "text": "I have been going to Richardson's for so many years. I can not believe that I have never reviewed this amazing restaurant! It's like an icon to the valley of the sun! Richardson's brings New Mexico to Arizona. Here you can find traditional New Mexican cuisine but also specialities like fish or great steaks with the spice that gives it southwestern flare and taste. I have never had a meal here that wasn't amazing and the service is always, ALWAYS consistent. I like to arrive early, put my name on the 'list' to wait for a table at Richardson's and have a drink 'down below' in the 'dungeon' of Rokerij.. the 'speak easy' feel of going underneath the main restaurant is always mysterious and fun to me. I love all of the copper top on the bars.. I kind of want that on my bar at home! Maybe I am just a little weird?! Okay. I get that! Down at Rokerij, you can pretty much find the same drinks and wines that you find at Richardson's. They have several sparkling wines and champagnes for me too! If its Fall or Spring, the patio of Richardson's is a great place to hang out and there is a fireplace that gives off a great ambient feeling. Drink specials and small plates on happy hour are a really great find! There are great tequilas, mezcals and that leads to what? Great margaritas! Last weekend, I was here with my daughter, who dub's this her 'very favorite restaurant' for southwestern food, when she is home from school on the east coast. This is her first stop and her last stop before heading back to school, always! The bar always makes her a refreshing Prickly Pear Lemonade that she requests when she is here. It's likely not special to her, but she thinks it is, and thats what matters. We always start with the Guacamole, housemade, of course and served with a trio of salsa and duo colored tortilla chips. We always love the New Mexico Con Queso too.. just the right amount of spice and chorizo and served in a hot skillet. This past weekend, I had the Surf and Turf; a nice sized filet mignon, two nice sized grilled prawns atop that, AND, (as if that is not enough!), Chorizo Enchiladas.. they are served open faced. The housemade beans come on the side. This is a huge meal, as most of the entrees here are! This plate is served on the classic pewter Rokerij/Richardson's plate that comes out HOT and will burn you if you don't mind it! I've had most of the entrees here, and again, I have NEVER been disappointed. My daughter had the New Mexico Enchiladas: three generous enchiladas of your choosing, ( she chose the green chile pork; grilled shrimp and the cheese), with green or red sauce and the green is usually the 'milder' of the two. We were so full we didn't want dessert, but the awesome waiter brought us flan anyway to share.. its almost like a caramel type cheesecake thats super creamy! We have had brunch here and again, nothing is even in the 'mediocre' category.. it falls into the 'amazing and FILLING' category! I highly recommend the Enchiladas and Eggs or the Huevos Rancheros and Eggs.. they will do the eggs any style; poached is my personal preference and they don't bat an eye! Oh! Weekend Brunch Mimosas! I like a Mimosa that is mainly Champagne and little OJ , #bckimberly, I swear I was given almost an entire bottle of champs and a small glass of OJ to add as I wished! The Bloody Mary is also worth the hair of your dog.. or your chinny, chin, chin left over from the night before. The staff here is on point.. Maybe one of the best in all of the valley.. attentive and not rushy. They will talk to you; leave the check when you need it to be left; OR let you linger and hang out and enjoy drinks or those mimosas! The history of this restaurant and all its endured makes it a place we continue to come back to over and over.. and now its the same for our daughter who talks about it while at school in DC. Tip: Richardson's does not take reservations unless there are more than 3 in your dinner party and the weekends and some, MANY week nights get busy! Parking is valet; bring cash to pay and tip! :-) Go to Richardson's hungry and ready for New Mexico spice.. this isn't your 'typical' Mexican food!",

We'd always choose to sit outside, being Phoenix the weather is always great and to be honest I think it's just far to dark inside.  My favorite is the double Pork Chop Chorizo. It's massive and will satisfy any hunger. Although I must admit last week while there half of the meat was far too undercooked. Asked for it medium but it was raw and I like my meat on the rarer side. I would've said something but I was completely full with what I'd eaten. That's the only time I wasn't 100% happy with my meal there.  If they have it, which sometimes they don't for some reason get the Mango Habenero sauce it's wonderful. Spicy but just so tasteful.  Nice atmosphere, a bit on the pricer side but I'll keep going back and I'm fussy about where I eat. Always a full house so you know they're doing something right.",

It is definitely a Phoenix staple, and a great example that you don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity. The atmosphere is top notch, and the service is hard to beat.   Richardson's is definitely aware of their value, so don't be surprised with a bill a bit pricier than your neighborhood go-to. Don't fret it, as this will probably be your future pick for date night for every date night to come.  Personal favorite: Chicken New Mexico Enchiladas with red sauce. Chips and the habanero verde salsa to start.",

The flavors are out of this world and it will make your mouth dance with joy.  Been to their other restaurants many times and always enjoy coming back. First got to experience this kind of treat at their older restaurant that mysteriously caught on fire. This place is a favorite of my boss and he usually pays. Nice!  Love the Chimayo Chicken and on other visits order one of the Fish Specials written on the board. The appetizers are delicious and you can easily get filled up on them quickly. Really enjoyed the Green Chili French Onion Soup on my last visit. It had the perfect amount of heat for me and made me break a sweat.  Service can be somewhat mediocre at times. Make sure to also bring a flashlight or have your smart phone app ready to go. It is ridiculously dark in there and can create a bit of a problem. You can always choose to eat outside at the bar or at one of the smaller tables.  This is not a cheap and inexpensive dining experience. Then again it is not super duper crazy expensive. They do have valet parking at certain times so don't be surprised.  Give them a shout out and get ready for some yummy flavors. You won't be disappointed. TOUCHDOWN IN MY MOUTH!  4.5 STARS",

Love the outdoor space (when the flies aren't rampant - which they were on our first visit so we opted to sit inside).  Service was excellent on both visits. Happy hour was a great surprise on the weekends! Entree portions are plentiful - come with a salad, starch and another veggie (WOW!). A great value for the price. - Bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was great - Salmon bites were good - Chorizo Porkchop was tasty with a nice medley of flavor combinations, but a little overcooked for my liking (I prefer medium since med. rare isn't an option. Definitely enough to split if ordering appetizers first. - Charred NY Steak topped with Crab and Hollandaise was delicious (Excellent the first time we ordered since it has a really deep, crusty char yet medium rare interior, the second visit we both ordered this and it was a tad overcooked and lacked the char so I was a little disappointed). - The GCP is a must try - a unique spin on the boring potato (it's worth the carbs!) - LOVE the veggie choices and ACORN SQUASH served with brown sugar and butter. YES PLEASE! Like mom used to make.  We enjoy this place and will be back again to try the Rokerij.",

It took me a pretty long time to try it and I'm surprised because we have been to the Rokerij next door more than a handful of times.   The margaritas were pretty delicious. The food was pretty darn good. We started with the chorizo queso, which I enjoyed a lot because it was more of a spinach and artichoke dip than a typical queso. The calamari was good but not memorable.   Main entrees that we ordered: NY strip steak with crab, garlic shrimp pasta, relleno platter and the pinenut crusted seabass. The NY strip with crab was probably the best - cooked perfectly and so flavorful. 2 of the 4 meals came with a side and the bartender recommended brussel sprouts. I normally like brussel sprouts so I tried it off my husband's plate. I thought they were kinda boring and my husband didn't enjoy them or our friend. The house salads were actually pretty good and plenty.   Next best - the seabass. This dish was also so flavorful and something I would probably order the next time if it's available. My pasta seemed bland compared the 3 other dishes. Honestly, it didn't even taste like there was much garlic in it - more like a light Alfredo pasta sauce. The jumbo shrimp were perfectly sized.  I couldn't give it 5 stars even though we enjoyed the food and drinks. Our service was pretty slow and we caught ourselves trying to make eye contact to get service at times. Sure it was a Saturday night, but it was not busy when we got there. We decided to grab drinks elsewhere after eating because it felt like it would have taken too long staying there. Overall a good first experience.",

Two of the six passed us by and said nothing.  I have no idea what your food tastes like but as a first time visitor, was looking forward to trying it.  Shame on you for ignoring me and now I am headed to Carlos O'Brien's to see if they give me the same type of garbage service I just received from you.  And I did share this with two soon to be visitors in the parking lot as we walked out. PS...it's 10:25 and I am sitting at Carlo's O Brien's and have a drink in my hand with Chips and Salsa.",

Six in our party. We opted for the patio alcove. Nice setting, dog friendly, easy parking in the back. Food was spectacular! Service was slow as warned by our friendly server. Not sure of the reason but servers were over extended. We opted for no appetizers due to slow service and decided to order. Loaned the server a pen so they could write the orders. The entrees  were served. One order was a redo as a burger was ordered with no veggies but it came with mushrooms.  I had the Chimayo Chicken. It was a tasty chicken breast stuffed with spinich sun dried tomato, poblano chili and assiago cheese served with an onion sauce. Dish had good heat. If you don't like spicy food don't order this dish.  Lunch included  brussel sprouts and a stuffed yam. Good thing apps were not ordered. Large portions, moderate prices but excellent food.  Some of us ordered coffee. No refill followup. Love the food and atmosphere here. Worth another trip. Very large menu so will be back and hope for better service or just plan for a very long lunch.",

It was excellent the best CA I have had in the AZ. Anything you order on the menu you will be taking some home. The portions are large! Did I mention the $6 Bloodys and Mimosas?? What a deal.

However, as a foodie, Richardson's isn't one of the restaurants that I would personally recommend. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the cuisine itself? Regardless, I always have a great time dining here.   The wonderful thing about their menu is there's definitely something for everybody - from mexican dishes to pastas and burgers. My go-to is their bacon wrapped jalapenos. You can't go wrong with the carne adovada. That slow roasted pork is tender and tasty. Their happy hour is great - their $6 bloody marys are addicting and their famous onion rings are a crowd pleaser.    I may not be the biggest fan of this place, and somehow I feel like i'm the only one who isn't!",

Most seating is bar type seating but they have a room in their mezzanine and the room just off the bar area. Most meals come with a choice of red or green Chile sauce. I personally prefer the green as it tastes more fresh and vibrant, but it's definitely the spicier of the two options. The red chile sauce has a more smoky type flavor, which is still very good, but not my personal preference. They have a bunch of different specials and a nice happy hour menu. They also make strong drinks! My Cadillac margarita was awesome!!!! It's actually where my husband and I had our first date- I worked night shift at the hospital so we met up after work for brunch. There brunch menu is also awesome, and they serve brunch until 4pm, which is especially nice because I enjoy sleeping in until at least 11am and taking my time before leave the house on my rare weekend off!",

    "text": "We recently attended a family birthday dinner here, and here's why Richardson's fell short for me.   While our waitress was very friendly and polite, because we were situated in the back, private room I thought service was extremely slow. It took a very long time to get drinks, service, and the check.   The drinks were fine, nothing special. I had a Moscow mule and a Paloma. The Moscow mule was like any other from any other restaurant, the Paloma was tasteless and I ended up only drinking half of it.   The appetizers were presented beautifully, however I thought they were odd and missed the mark. We shared the roasted garlic, sausage and beans and the bacon wrapped jalapenos. The jalapenos were the best dish of the evening, I thought the sausage and bean combination was odd, and the garlic was interesting - but the roasted veggies were large and an odd shape to manipulate to put on a piece of bread.   The house salad was good, fresh, crisp - dressed just right!   Here's where I thought everything went downhill...my steak!! I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin covered in king crab and smothered in jalapeno hollandaise sauce with broccolini and mashed potatoes. The tenderloin was so aggressively chared on the outside I took 3 bites of it and had to stop. The sauce was delicious and the crab was nice, but there was a large piece of shell in the lump on my plate. The mashed potatoes had a fluffy texture but no taste, but the broccolini was perfectly cooked. I was so disappointed with the meal as was my husband!   We shared the creme brulee and it was fine nothing special.   And that's how I felt about the meal, nothing special. It was a VERY expensive night for a family of 9 and my expectations were not met. Due to that I probably will not be returning.",

Ordered a couple drinks after waiting for anyone to serve us, just in time too we were feeling a little left out. Ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and it was delivered to us pretty burned, had to send them back.  Looked at other Yelp photos of this same dish and didn't even compare - charred black. Ordered the ribs, they were very good.",

Manager said they went through a \"major house cleaning a month ago and new staff are not all trained.\"  So we wasted $80 for 2 people to train their staff?  Manager offered apology and suggested we come back in a couple of months.  FAT CHANCE!!",

Service is worse than ever and the food does not make up for it anymore. It is either too spicy or severely overcooked and dry. It will be a while before we return!!",

We were all terribly disappointed in the customer service and it ruined our experience completely.  First of all, the hostess was phenomenal and very helpful in assisting us.  We were seated in the middle patio after a short wait, and that's where the disappointment started.  We saw our waiter a total of 5 times, which involved waiting over a half hour to order food and then another half hour at the end to finally get our bill.  Our drinks were empty for 75% of our time there and we were never even offered the chance to order another.  Also, there was no apology when I commented on his long disappearances.  The whole thing would have been a little more understandable had the place been packed, but it was later in the evening and the restaurant was by no means full. We expected far better service at a restaurant with this reputation!",

    "text": "Nice to see that some things never change.  A friend and I decided to try Richardson's last night after a late meeting since they are open late. We started at Sierra Bonita Grille but they close at 9pm on Monday nights and actually referred us to Richardson's.  So we arrived at Richardson's at 9:30pm. Where the hell is the door into the place?!? There were 4 people at the bar. No sign whether we seat ourselves. Finally we got the bartender's attention and he told us to sit anywhere and that yes, the kitchen was open.  We sat in a booth. A busboy brought us water. And then we waited....and waited...and waited...and joked about them being soooo busy that no one could help us. Finally, a tall, jet-black haired waitress with a nose piercing that looked like a giant booger hanging in her nostril came to the table. She was a bitch with an attitude and acted extremely annoyed to have to wait on us or answer a single simple question about the appetizer. Again...a bitch. We almost walked at that point.  We ordered a draft beer, a glass of reisling, and their whole garlic appetizer that comes with toast points. And then we waited....waited....waited. We never saw the waitress again and the bartender stepped in and waited on us the rest of the night. The food and drinks arrived. All were good. Loved the appetizer.  The bill then came. $32 for a glass of cheap wine, a draft beer and an appetizer of a head of roasted garlic, some melted cheese and toast points. Good God. And, let me mention that the air was heavy HEAVY with smoke from the kitchen. We both walked out smelling so strongly of smoke that I showered when I got home to get the smell out of my hair.  So....congratulations Richardsons! Even with the change in location you have obviously worked hard to cement your reputation of having the biggest assholes for wait staff. That must take some doing and I applaud your consistency over the years.   We will never, ever step foot into Richardson's again. There are far too many better restaurants in Phoenix who actually give a shit that you are there. Can't wait to tell everyone I know, and I'm in public relations, to stay the hell away from this place.",

Cons: the entire lot is valet, and you don't have a choice to opt out, unless you park across the street in someone else's lot.  Also a bit too pricey to visit often, but a nice treat.",

Decided to go for a late lunch, & received mediocre service in an obviously slow time for the servers- we were one of maybe three parties in the whole restaurant. Our food came out after what seemed like a long wait for the amount of business they had at the time, & appeared to have been sitting under a hot lamp for longer than it should have.. The beans & rice were bone dry & crispy. The enchilada sauce was half dried up, with it's accompanying enchiladas stuck to the plate. Overall, the food was terrible, especially for the price! I've had really great tex mex before, and Richardson's flopped in comparison. And with barely there service, I would not recommend this restaurant for tex mex. You can definitely do MUCH better.",

I think the fact that our waitress was distracted and oblivious for most of the meal really tainted my experience.  We were seated in the front patio and she rarely came by to check on us.  Since we were starving we ate our queso appetizer without any silverware or napkins, and we ended up never getting any till after our entrees arrived.  I had to hail down a waitress from a neighboring table to get some for us and she was visibly annoyed.  How else were we exactly supposed to eat?!  I hated my drink, having ordered the prickly pear margarita after being assured that it wasn't sweet, but it was.  Of course the waitress never came by to check on us, so I couldn't trade it in for something else, but a friend graciously switched with me.  My enchiladas were nice and the portion generous, but it was on the spicy side so beware.  The restaurant seemed charming enough and the food was good enough to save this from being a two star rating.",

It had a mashed potato side served in a roasted whole green Anaheim pepper.  Excellent!!  The small salads with salmon, either 4 oz or 8 oz depending on the salad size was excellent.  The seafood trilogy was excellent as well.  They have large billboards with the specials of the day.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive.  It appears to be a \"mom and pop\" place which is our favorite.  They have a good selection of wines that are a little pricey but wine really does enhance the meal.

But last night's dinner was one of the top 3 worst dinning experiences of my life.  I don't think the night could of possibly gone worse.  We walked in and were completely ignored.  Servers acted like we were in the way (there was no where to go - didnt they just remodel?  Couldnt they fix that?). And the restaurant was practically empty.  Finally someone came up to us and asked to help us.  I told them we had a reservation and they started to walk us to a table.  The aisle is only one person wide and he walked us to a table full of people.  He said \"oops, that was wrong, I guess we are going over there...\" so we all had to turn around and shimmy down the aisle to the OTHER side of the restaurant.  We were sat in a booth for a few moments when we were approached by an employee who told us we couldnt sit there and the person who sat us \"was just a busser.\"  Um, WTF?  So we are moved to a 1/2 booth/table.  Finally sat, a server immediately approaches us and asked if we would like something to drink or an appetizer.  Um, just sat down, super annoyed, can i get a minute to recover please?    And this server then proceeded to suck my will to live the rest of the night.  More on that later, though.  It is ridiculously dark in the restaurant.  Like, cannot see jack dark.  And the pillows in the booths kind of gross me out...like sleeping in a stranger's bed with dirty sheets.  And bottom line, the food isnt good enough to put up with price and the hassle of valet parking.  My mother in laws steak was well done when she ordered it medium.  My \"stuffed\" pork chop didnt appear to have anything in it.  But again, it was so dark I could of been eating a bear for all I know.  Back to the server.  She would take our order, not write it down and come back FIVE MINUTES LATER and double check with us what we ordered.  And her guess was wrong!  She did it with the drink order AND the food order.  So I guess it makes sense the steak was incorrectly cooked...  End of drinner, we just want to get the hell out...server takes the bill and credit card, brings it back with no receipt to sign.  And of course never comes back.  We had to hunt someone down and he brought us back the recipt to sign.  Sigh.  At the very end of the night, we then get stuck waiting in a line for the valet.  Some lady butted in front at the line.  Unfortunately for her, she got the brunt of my frustrations.  Poor gal was probably just as scarred by her shitty dinning experience.",

All were delicious.  We enjoyed the Seabass special that was accompanied with vegetables and their delicious potato stuffed in a green chili. My husband enjoyed the Taos trio that included grilled shrimp, sausages, and a delicious quesadilla. My son had one of their specialties for which they are known for, pork arcavado. Delicious. We finish this fantastic meal with a delicious salon. Nothing compares to it and any other restaurant. This southwest restaurant and  is a must for people who enjoy food with a bite and Southwest flare. Thanks Jason to adding to a really spectacular dinner experience",

I enjoyed my Mimosa a great deal.  For brunch, I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict that I thought was rich and delicious.  Would have loved a piece or two of fruit to help cut the richness but it's a minor complaint.  I would definitely order this again and return for Brunch.  My partner had the Adovado Benedict and that was also delicious.  The service was pleasant.  We will definitely be back.",

If they posted a sign in an obvious place that said that, I would have never walked in.  We had a group of 7, and an a waiter that seemed new and had no clue about the menu items.  We asked for something that wasn't spicy.  Four of the 7 of us sent back our cheese enchiladas, because they were inedible, and crazy spicy.  An arrogant guy, who called himself the manager, never came over to talk to us, until we went looking for him.  They refused to bring us something else without charging us again, he claimed he was standing by his small letters on the paper menu, and it was our problem.  Customer service at its absolute worst.  Everyone has an off night, but I would never return after that experience.",

    "text": "One hour. That is how long we waited after ordering before we decided we would rather eat anywhere that wasn't here. A crushing, impressively underwhelming experience in lack of service.  We arrived and found:  Free valet parking? With a teensy parking lot, this works, thank you.   A good selection of indoor and outdoor seating? Also a plus.   Setting expectations and/or taking care of waiting customers? EPIC FAIL.  On a beautiful AZ autumn morning we came here (tho we entered Rockerij). We asked to be re-seated outside because inside of Rockerij is dark as a tomb and had loud conversation-intruding music. We were reseated by the fireplace and a waiter came over shortly to take our order. So far so good...or so we thought. 30 Mins after placing our order, I ask another waiter to check on the status of our food and he cleverly asks about what we ordered (exactly)...so we think it is being taken care of. 40 MINS after placing our order, I have still only had my coffee refilled once...and had to flag down another waiter to inquire about the status of our food again, because our actual waiter is nowhere to be found and the previous \"drive-by\" waiter never returned. A few mins beyond that, this guy actually comes back and indicates that our order is nearly ready and should only be a few minutes longer. Shortly thereafter OUR waiter stops by with comments of:   \"I don't know why it's taking so long...\" and \"I put the ticket in right after I took your order...\"  So...as a waiter...maybe it might be part of your job to check on the status of an order say...15mins after bringing it by the kitchen? Perchance? What do you think?  FIFTEEN (15 == few?) minutes later, we still had no food and I'd had quite enough. Out the door we went.  On a comical note: As we were outside (another 5 minute wait because the valet had our car either parked in Egypt somewhere or tandem?) our waiter came out to find us to let us know that our food was ready if we'd like to come back inside?  Oh R E A L L Y? The Clue-Delivery Train will be visiting you shortly. Facial cues you may want to look for in the future are: 1) the furrowed eyebrows 2) fuck-you facial expression and 3) curling fists  It seems that we are not alone in this. Courtney W.'s review (10/14/12) is representative of what we experienced.  I am dumbfounded how they have any good reviews. There must be a serious drought of sit down restaurants in this part of town, because this crap would never fly where I live. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.  P.S. They own 3 restaurants apparently: Richardson's, Rokerij, and Dick's Hideaway...all right in the same area (Rokerij and Richardson's being attached).   P.P.S. They all serve the same menu. It is NOT amazing. I have previously been to Dick's. Yes, it is good. No my socks did not come flying off.  P.P.P.S. ProTip: Drive down to Central Phoenix and go to Durant's, Portland's, Switch, or Fez. All of these places have exemplary service and food to match.",

Service is always good and the atmosphere is great which is essential for fine dining. To bear this out; PF Changs opened a spin off Asian restaurant that was about 5,000 s.f. and almost never filled up. Because of this \"cafeteria\" atmosphere, even though the food was identical to PF Chang's it didn't taste as good and the experience was not there. Goes to show that PF Chang's and Oregano's have got it down. They have good food and are limited in seating so that they are always full and on a wait which really adds to the atmosphere.",

Service was good.  The $12 specialty margaritas DID NOT produce a buzz and I COULD NOT taste the tequila. Yes, I SAID IT, 12 DOLLARS!!  (Pint size with ice)  I guess if i order a $12 drink, I expect to taste some liquor in it and it should probably come in a giant margarita glass, like at Arriba's.  I think that the owners are cheap and trying to lure a snooty crowd that likes to show their friends how to properly waste some perfectly good money!!!  I had been to the old location several times.  Won't find me coming back to the new location though.  You've failed to retain an old customer.  Oh,  and the valet parking is just irritating. I walked out and there's my car, parked 20 feet away, and I gotta wait for the guy to get it for me?  All those blue cones are enough to piss ya off!!  What other place in Phoenix is like this?

Twice I was told the change I requested to my food was possible and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The third time I came as a paying customer to their restaurant, I was given a dirty look by my waiter, but my food was served to me as I had asked. Following this experience I attempted to try to dish as the restaurant originally prepares it and I was absolutely disgusted. Upon my final attempt to order the dish as I preferred, I was told they will no longer make the dish this way for me. In return, I will no longer be recommending this restaurant to people, and the 3 people who thought to possibly return here after I brought them, will also be informed of this disservice. I have now been informed by someone, likely an employee, that their food is also laden with semen.",

I couldn't believe it was the exact same!!  That was a little weird, but in that the restaurant LOOKED the same, the food TASTED the same if not better!  Sea bass was perfect in every way! I had the chili rellenos which I love.  The sevice was wonderful! I believe his name was John.

A 2 hour 10 minute disaster! First server warned us of the 16 min garlic platter which was fine, we were excited to try it. Didn't realize she also waited to put our order in until after we ate it. With 11 people on the patio (4 kiddos) at 108 degrees with misters they turned off on us after sitting down for 10 mins...it's a no brainier to grab the manager for an explanation. Well, that didn't happen because the mgr left for the Dicks last Resort location??? It is Friday night, is it not??? So the kitchen lost our ticket was the explanation and when the mgr showed his face he decided to give us a 12% discount on our evening. Sorry, not good enough! Too many other great choices in the area to go back again. Blahhhh!!!! Server was sweet...not her fault...just inadequate management!",

The food is fantastic, creative and always hot which is something I really like.  Went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.  The service, however, was a different matter.  Our waitress was not pleasant and either completely overwhelmed or just incapable.  We would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.  Even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.  We actually had to go find someone it was so bad.  We asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks, we got attitude and the its not my section look.  In addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was really bit**y and showed no personality or interest in us being there.  We were there for almost two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good, its tough to enjoy when you can't even get a glass of water.  Lastly, we ordered red beers and rather than charging us the $3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on bloody Mary's.  Not a big deal but didn't really seem right.  We will ultimately go back but with their understaffed or just poorly trained service they missed out on an additional $70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just can't stay away any longer.  Really hoping the next experience will be better.",

The service was horrendous, the brunch doesn't accomodate families. The menu is full of empty threats regarding plate sharing and a 20% gratuity on parties of 8 or more. The food looks tremendous, but I couldn't bring myself to order because my beer came to the table looking like someone had taken a swig from it, and we were waiting 15 minutes for a cup of coffee. The only people this place serves with respect and decency during Sunday morning brunch are martini ordering geriatrics and drunks from the night before. It has a great reputation, yet feels the need to ride the coattails of that as opposed to holding a quality/standard of service that should be commonplace in an area with strict competition. Do not bring your children. this place obviously prefers to serve adult clientele. My daughter is three, well behaved but we were still ignored.",

This is located down the street from the Hilton at Squaw Peak and probably the best restaurant in the area that is filled with a lot of chain type restaurants. I had heard about the Rokerij small plates menu from office workers and I thought I would give it a try. My girlfriend and I did not have any reservations, so we went downstairs in their bar area and ate the bar. You can order the Mew Mexican specialities or the Rokerij side of the menu. There was so much to choose from so we decided to eat off of the small plates menu. We chose the 3 small plates for $25. I was thinking the plates were going to be small and that we would not be filled. I appreciated that on the menu they told you how many \"pieces\" you were going to get of each item. The tenderloin on toast with triple cream brie was delicious. The amount of tenderloin was just right and the cream brie made it taste over the top. The scallops were cooked perfectly as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the taco sampler. Everything is fresh and the service was great. The couple next to us ordered off of the New Mexican cuisine side. The servings were ample and looked very tasty. I have heard the menu for brunch is equally fanstastic, can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "During a short trip to Phoenix, Richardson's got on the list of must go to restaurants. The reservation was made and the pictures of platings had been viewed several times over... Needless to say we were excited to go.   On first impression the place and atmosphere is extraordinary, the dim lighting made us all look really good and the waitress was one of those that didn't need to wright your order down. This is the reason that I didn't give less stars.   The food was not so good. I listened to a radio broadcast recently where Steve Wells (a famous food critic from the NYT) talked about how Instagram and the Internet had changed the way chefs think about presentation rather then actual flavor profiles. The dish I had was a perfect example of this. I ordered a steak - can't remember the name of the actual dish but I looked amazing. My mouth actually started salivating when food came mainly because I had saved myself all day for this moment. And then... I took a bite. Nothing tasted as good as it looked. The steak was chewy and l was simply dissatisfied.   If your thinking about visiting this restaurant I encourage you to go. I'm better for having gone once in my life then never having gone at all. It may be that southwestern cuisine doesn't move me, however, the visit and atmosphere is worth a peek.",

Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.  A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.  In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.  I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!",

Hostess says we can sit at the bar and she'll put or name on the wait list.  Meanwhile, at the bar we watch several parties of 2, without reservations, get seated at tables large enough for 4.

The platter of food is enormous, so I got a take home container. The next day for lunch I went to eat the leftovers. I took a bite and got pierced in the roof of my mouth with a bone. Wasn't small. I'm a guy that takes big bites, so this bone wasn't something I noticed. It was sharp and over 2 inches. I took pics and complained. Nothing was done. I email management, nothing. I called, no call back.   For a place that charges what they do... Get bones out of your meat. Disgusting. Not only did I lose my appetite but I got a cut in my mouth.

Food was off and seemed like there was a major lack of leadership in the front and back of the house.   It's a shame because the flavors are good and group liked the food.

Both red and green chillies which really are the hallmark of new Mexican cuisine are very sub-par. Red chili was a bit bitter and the green chili was just a low on flavor gooey mess. The service was very inattentive as well, too long to take orders or pick up the check. Just remember sitting and waiting for something to happen most of the evening. A lot of mistakes were made as well, the waitress nodded to acknowledge our special requests like \"only green chili and not Christmas\"  but the dishes eventually came out as they were described on the menu. Don't think we'll be back",

    "text": "We have been frequenting Richardson's for the last three years at least 3-4 times a month. The last time we visited the hostess sat us in what I like to refer to as the concrete-hole booth where no one can see you and you cannot see out (if you've been there you know which one I'm talking about). The hostess then neglected telling our server we were there so we sat in the concrete abyss for nearly 15 minutes before our server peeked over the wall at us. That visit ended well as the server knew how upset we were and did everything she could to make it right.   However, today we had a server I never met before. She left us sit for a while too, but we were in full view of her and every other staff member. When she finally came to our table, we inquired about chocolate milk for my granddaughter and received an emphatic \"NO\", not \"No, I'm sorry we don't have chocolate milk but we do have...\" just a rude abrupt NO followed by silence. Then my scrambled eggs arrived with the entire top of the pile just sort of jellied, not runny but definitely 'jellied'. She kindly took them back to the kitchen to throw back on the grill for a second or two. She returned with a plate of rubbery, burnt eggs and told me next time I need to request \"hard scrambled\". Well, NO dear lady, next time I would like my eggs scrambled the way they should be, soft and fluffy with no jellied grossness hanging around the top or the middle. We then sat, and sat,  and sat, and sat staring at my pile of uneaten food and my companions dirty dishes. When she ignored us and walked away one last time I said, \"Excuse me Ma'am. Can we get our check please.\" At this point I was met with a rude \"Give me a minute!\" accompanied by a feisty glare. My husband then suggested maybe I should wait outside while he settled the bill. Good thing for her I took his advice because I don't generally respond well to rude, feisty glares.   Richardson's... I am sorely disappointed and this last experience will probably keep me from coming back because if you try to seat me in that girls station I'll get up and leave. You should do the math: 3-4 times a month at nearly $100 a pop. That's a lot of lost revenue.  And since I'll be sure to share my experience with others, you should remember, word of mouth is a powerful advertising tool as well.   I used to love you. Now I'm just booooooo Richardson's, I'm taking my money down the street.",

Because it was just valet at the front. So i of course had to valet it. Which to me is odd. I'm not a huge fan of a valet service. I'm a big boy, I'll park my own fucking vehicle, FOR FREE. But whatev's.   I tried to bypass that. We entered and found a both near the bar. The food is a mix/hybrid/fusion of mexican-new mexican food.   I forgot what I had at the time. But I remember it being REALLY REALLY good. We also shared a great bottle of red wine that our server recommended to us.   The service was awesome, the food was amazing. A bit pricy, but like i've said before. You get what you pay for.   Definitely a place to check out, a wonderful date environment.",

I ordered a $5 bellini which was on special and decided on the tenderloin hash special and my husband ordered the crab cake benedict. My tenderloin hash was cooked to my specifications along with a nice runny fried egg on top with beans on the side. My bellini was a generous pour as well. My husbands benedict was amazing and full of flavor with a rich hollondaise and really good crab cakes , I was jealous I didn't order it. The portion sizes were huge, we probably could've shared one dish. Prices were a little on the higher side, but the quality and amount of food made up for it.",

From reviews I read before going, I was lucky enough to grab a parking spot out front because they're tiny little parking lot is usually valet. I hate valet!  Anyway, the cobblestone, hanging plant walk-way was pretty cute. Oh and the firepit seating and couches look like they'd be really cozy and intimate for an evening cocktail. So they've def got that going from them. Although when I was walking through the entrance no one greeted me. There were two guys who looked like they worked there just standing around. Come on, man.  The host thre me off too. He wasn't in a uniform or anything that identified him as the host, so I was a little taken back.   But when we were seated, I loved the adobe like seating arrangements and the lighting in the place made me feel like I was in a 1950s New Mexico saloon having a whiskey at 2 o'clock in the afternoon with a surly old bartender... that's a good feeling.  Wasn't impressed that the waiter didn't bring us chips and salsa until 30 seconds before our meal arrived but they were tasty. I orded the Taos Club because I love avocados. It turned out to be more of  wrap cut into 3s and not wrapped tight enough because it was disaster to eat and nothing stayed inside. The accompanying salad would have been way better had it b=not been slathered in ranch.   I had such high hopes for this place, but I honestly can't say that I'd go back. Wah Wahhh.",

I tried my friend's lamb rack and it was boring and flavorless.   Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise, the food doesn't worth the visit.

The server was not overwhelming and very informative. I am a steak guru and decided to order the surf and turf dish with steak. I ordered it rare and it was prepared perfectly. I was AMAZED on the quality of beef that was used. I'm very apprehensive to places that serve steak considering its basic USDA choice, not prime. However, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased.

I several times debated making the 300+ mile drive simply to eat the Carne Adovada and then drive home.  It's that good.  Also, the Carne Adovada Benedict is great for breakfast, the orange juice is fresh squeezed.  I am sure there is also a Carne Adovada Flan that is to die for.

There is a back entrance which is really cool, a descending stone stairwell in front that leads to the underground bar, and a main entrance.  They call their food \"New Mexican Cuisine\" which is perfect.  It's not traditional Mexican, they have little tweeks and variations of many Mexican favorites.  Mixed in are modern American fish and chicken dishes with a new Mexican twist.  You can regularly catch them fire roasting the green chiles out back, and they are used in various dishes.  I love stopping in here anytime I'm in the area.

The Carne Avado was spicy and so flavorful even my husband who does need eat spicy food enjoyed the complex flavors. I had a chicken Caesar with grilled chicken.

We found a table on our own at the outside bar. The atmosphere was great.  The server took a long time to approach and again gave us no information until we asked.

Richardson's Cusine of New Mexico is a unique dining spot with an \"Old Phoenix\" ambiance. It helps that it's also located in \"Old Phoenix\" and is dark and cozy. I had a special called the Taos Trio or combo. It consisted of Carne Adovado, Bacon wrapped Shrimp and home made spicy sausage with green chili potatoes. Incredible food! Several people ordered the Chilean seabass which I tried and this was also wonderful.  Service was excellent and we really enjoyed dining for 4. Apparently, this place takes no reservations, but uses a call-ahead approach up to about 6:45. We were in Paradise Valley and gave the 10 minute warning and they greeted us as we came in.

    "text": "My husband and I went for an early dinner here for our anniversary.  We are crazy about this place after just this one visit, Jason was our waiter and he absolutely makes your evening so great !  We sat inside, it was not smokey in there at all.  We arrived about 5pm, Jason said all the tables were reserved at 6:00 and 6:15, so he sat us in a nice booth but we needed to out by 6:15 ( good to know going in, right ! )  Speaking of reservations, you cannot make a reservation for 2 at all, must be 4 thats because they only have a few booths inside, large outside seating on their beautiful patio with fire pit. The food, I had the three enchiladas and you can pick what you want in each one.  My pick was one with green chili pork, one chicken and one cheese, comes with rice and beans and a large very tasty tortilla.  Most places the rice and beans are filler, but here they are so good, you will eat every bite.  The green chili pork was my favorite, the chicken was really good coming in second and the cheese which is usually my fav comes in third  My husband had the carne adovada rice and beans and tortilla.  He really enjoyed it, and the portions were to large that we had it again for lunch the next day. Appetizer you must try the queso with spinach and chorizo comes with blue and regular chips so tasty, so spicy good we ate every drop, the blue chips were the best. We tried the flan, it does have cream cheese in it so its not like regular flan, but its good too. Love, Love, Love this place, their food and Jason ! At dinner all parking is valet.",

I made my first trip back home to AZ to see my mom and sisters.The girls went out for a day filled with food, laughter, and love. We saved the BEST for last. RICHARDSON'S!!!!!!!  Between the 4 of us, we ordered some of the best items on the menu. Carne Adobada, Enchiladas, Mexican Chicken Cordon Blue, and ooooooohhhhh the Chili Relleno!!!!! Richardson's has the most impressive chili rellenos I have ever experienced. And I have experienced some freaking Rellenos!  I would not expect to find Mexican food this good out of a some what up scale restaurant in what my sister would call Cen Pho (FYI, I would NEVER call it that).  Great job Richardson's!!!!!",

From the moment we got there, the hostess was rude and when I asked if they could turn the air up before my friend turned into a popsicle, we were declined. I then asked if we could turn the fan off right above us and she still said no without any explanation. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and I would say there was MAYBE three pieces of shrimp in the entire dish.   Splitting up the check was a nightmare since we were told they dont do seprate checks , she came over probably every two minutes to make sure we were moving along in the bill splitting process. It was not relaxing, enjoyable or worthwhile. It was a going away dinner for one of my friends and I was sad to say that upon leaving, I knew she wasn't thrilled with the service or the food.",

    "text": "Everyone in the \"know\" in Phoenix knows about the Rokerji / Richardsons. This place serves the best southwestern food hands down. Ask Esquire magazine, who awarded them best bar in America. And of course Phoenix Mag gives their nod to this place almost every year. These 2 restaurants occupy the same real estate but the Rokerji is in the basement and it is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is 5 stars. Big sofas, large booths in a Grotto like setting with a roaring fire. It doesn't get any better than this. The menu is the same whether you choose to stay up top at Richardsons or go down below to the basement. The food is hands down the best of its kind in town. Now if you are heat sensitive, listen to your server. The owner of these places means it when he says \"spicy\" but it's oh so worth the pain. My favorite here is the Carne Adovada with an egg on top. It is unforgettable. The egg is the magic touch to me with this dish. They tend to have this more on the breakfast side but don't let that deter you. You can have them add the egg anytime. The richness of the warm yolk melding into this dish sends it over the top. Trust me you will absolutely love it. I give The Rokerji / Richardsons 5 stars in spite of some of the tired burned out staff members. Unfortunately some of the servers here have forgotten the True meaning of being in the service industry.  It is my feeling that the owner, Richardson, needs to remind his staff that there is 3 parts to a great dining experience. The ambiance, the fantastic food and the SERVER.  But for now overlook the occasional subpar server and give this place a try. It will become one of your favorite spots right after your first mouthwatering bite.",

    "text": "Good food, terrible service. Maybe nice for a bar dinner for two, but definitely not kid-friendly.  We went today to catch a celebratory brunch for a few family achievements. My wife and I tow along a toddler and an infant, and we wanted to get a table for 6, for the other family coming in. The hostess looked at us like we were blood-stained hobos or something, and seemed oh-so-upset that she had to take us to our table. When we asked if there were high chairs or accommodations for the infant in the car seat, she flatly replied no and suggested we could put our infant on the floor. You know, totally normal restaurant practice.  The staff, from bus boy to waiters, seemed to do just the bare minimum. No smiles or friendly talk, and it was almost like they didn't want to make eye contact. I'm Asian so with my squinty eyes I can understand if people have a hard time making eye contact. But my in-laws have perfectly normal eyes. One waitress, who was also attending at the bar, was nice enough to talk to us a bit, but was too busy and eventually had to ask another grumpy person to take care of us.   Anytime we had questions, like whether we could sit outside, or where the restroom is, or, oh I don't know, if we could I have a water refill, we'd be met with what looked like eye-rolling. We all felt uncomfortable. I actually felt relieved to leave, eventually.   Food was nice, but not good enough to warrant coming back for.",

    "text": "As a long time patron of Richardson's I am always taking new people in and encouraging others to come downtown and try it!  This occasion, February 28, 2014, one of my good friends and I stopped in for a much anticipated lunch together.  This is the first time I have ever considered never returning.  The restaurant was not busy  There was only 12 people in the inside dining area between 11 am and 12:30. We arrived at 11am and chose to sit at the bar inside. The young woman at the bar greeted me and served me a glass of wine and then proceeded to continue her \"set up the bar\" duties.   When my friend arrived we waited several minutes and then I had to call to the server to ask someone to take my friend's drink order. 5 + minutes later our server/bartender still had not brought the requested beer although the server/bartender was right there on the other side of the bar in full view. 3 feet away from us. Remember the restaurant was not busy.  We ordeedr the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer to share and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was amazing, as usual.  Unfortunately we could not seem to get ANY service for a glass of water or a second glass of wine.  Again I had to ask the server to please ask the bartender, or whomever was supposed to be working behind the bar, to please see if someone was available to serve us. At this point we still had not been able to order lunch.  The Bartender/ young woman who initially served us come up to take the drink order and I asked if the three salads on the chalk board were good.  She assured me they were excellent.  I am used to the house salad, which is excellent, and we assumed we could count on something of that quality.   We ordered the beef tenderloin salad split and another glass of wine and a beer. 12-15 minutes later we still did not have our drinks. There was NO ONE new inside the dining room and one party out on the patio and several servers so as far as we could see there was no reason for the total lack of service.  Another 10-15 minutes and the salad showed up on one plate.   This salad was a very un-inspired 'Cesar\" with limp flavourless beef flopped on top of a mound of rusty romaine lettuce and some basic croutons with some shaved Parmesan Crude and messy presentation and it was certainly not what we envisioned.  The server went to \"find\" some small plates and the salad was then deposited on the bar for us to split. No serving pieces were provided for us to accomplish this. She also did not offer to assist or to take the salad back to the kitchen to be re-plated.   Maybe I am being picky here but I can get a terrible salad at any Denny's or Village Inn. Richardson's is known for service and quality. The service was non-existent. The salad was terrible, overpriced and tasted flavourless. The only thing that was good was the wine (which we had to practically beg for) and the shrimp appetizer which is all on the kitchen's skill.  So feeling very un-welcome and very disappointed in the salad, lack of service, and our expectations for a great lunch - we gave up and decided to forgo anything additional. 60 dollars later we were happy to just leave.   I am terribly disappointed. Richardson's is my go-to restaurant for special occasions, lunch with friends, happy hour - you name it. I can go to Postino's (closer to my house) or Windsor, Zinburger - any number of other options for a great meal. I fully expect Richardson's uniquely prepared high-end food when I come here and for 60 dollars for lunch I would hope to be at least not frustrated and hungry when I leave.",

I was tasked with planning a dinner for about 50 of my colleagues who would be traveling to AZ from various parts of the country. Because we have been having the most incredible weather and because Richardson's is known for authentic New Mexican cuisine (which I thought many would not have experienced before) I decided on this restaurant's patio for our setting.   Working with the events manager was great, she was very responsive and easy to work with, I had great expectations! Sadly, it all went to sh*t on the night of the dinner. First of all, they had two servers on a 50+ person party. Whaaa? I felt bad for the servers as they were completely set up to fail. Second, when one of my colleagues asked if some of our tables could get water, after waiting 45 minutes, the manager got in her face. Inappropriate!   The manager later apologized and our colleagues who had not yet been greeted or helped were quickly taken care of. I appreciate them stepping up but these thing should have never happened in the first place. As great as the food was, and that is the only reason for my two stars, I will not be heading back to Richardson's anytime soon.",

The blue and yellow corn chips were warm, light and crispy.  The salsas were great but I wished the Habanero had a stronger kick.    Blue Wedge Salad with Cajun Chicken ($9): The chicken was great, it was moist, tender and very flavorful.  However it had tortilla strips and black bean salsa, so it should have been called the \"Tex-Mex Blue Wedge Salad with Chicken\". It didn't come with Blue Cheese Crumbles only blue cheese dressing with very little blue cheese crumbles.  Cuban Sandwich ($9): last time I had a Cuban sandwich was at Porto's in Burbank, CA.  Porto's Cuban sandwich had very thinly sliced ham, pork, Swiss cheese in a delicious flatten sandwich.  However, the Cuban Sandwich had 1/2 inch thick ham, roast pork and a green sauce and a Swiss cheese (see picture). They should have renamed this the \"Thick Cut Cuban Sandwich\".   My visit was good, but I will definitely try another restaurant when I'm in Phoenix, AZ again.",

I had a gimlet with a splash of grapefruit juice.  It was good  but with no room at the bar while we waited (make reservations of you have a chance) as they used it primarily as overflow for dinners at both bars and told not to go downstairs to the bar as no cell service down there...  We were offered a chance to dine at the bar and debated but decided against it which seemed to irk the hostess a bit.  We started with the scallops which were grilled perfectly, huge and on a flour tortilla which contained rice, beans, queso and green chillies.  Really wish I had taken a pic.  5 stars for this dish!   I had the New Mexican which included bacon wrapped grilled shrimp, chicken enchilada in red and green Chile sauce and a cheese relleno.  The cheese relleno which was not fully melted in the middle.  Not only hard but also a bit cold in the middle.  I would give 4 stars but the bar situation and no real waiting area irked me a little.  I give 3.5 stars for this, 4 but for the relleno.    We will be back!",

    "text": "New Mexican cuisine done right- this is the original of trifecta of restaurants (rokerij and dicks hideaway) that have similar menus.  A cozy patio entrance greets visitors in a warm welcoming way.  After 2 visits off peak times we have had no wait. I recommend the happy hour from 3-6 as most appetizers are a few dollars off.  A decent house margarita sets my mood with a happening bar area and fast moving staff.  Brooke did a great job on our recent visit.  She knows a lot about the dishes and can answer any questions that one may have.  So many great specials this evening including a cheese steak option!  We are in a Mexican mood every day so we order a beef chili relleno and smoked chicken toastadas.  Very crispy shells with yummy chicken and a salad atop- could have benefitted from a salsa or aioli.  The relleno was super classic on a grill pan with yummy bubbly sauce and delicious cheese.  Sharing the adovada was a smart move on our part.  You can substitute the rice and beans for a veggie or salad so we did a salad. This keeps the meal light because the red chili pork is very smoky and flavorful but a generous portion.  We loved it!  We did not hear about desserts and this is my one regret after dining at Richardsons.  We had 2 drinks each and everything came to about $75 for 2 people.",

I have a gluten allergy and it looked like just about everything had gluten in it... again, couldn't tell. We asked the waiter (who showed up about 30 mins after we had sat down - not kidding, but it was late and he gave us free chips/salsa as an apology) about the possibility of corn tortillas, mentioned the gluten allergy and he claimed it was no problem. He would make sure our orders came out okay. One of the things we ordered had a panko crust, which he told us as he came out with it rather than as we were ordering it. Not a huge deal - I just didn't eat that one. The food took forever to come out after we had ordered and it was all super mushy. I really liked the enchiladas and the garlic appetizer, but they came with bread on top - and this is after we told him about the gluten allergy. This place is a nightmare for celiacs. Thankfully I don't react too strongly, so I ate around it, but it was so stressful and annoying.",

    "text": "Well...I am quite frustrated at this place. I will be more than happy to change my review when I actually get a chance to try the food and experience the restaurant.  My fiancee wanted to take me to a nice dinner on Sunday night and I've heard great things about Richardsons and wanted to try something new. We did get a little bit of a late start, and didn't leave the house until about 9pm. The hours on Google are a bit misleading because when you type in \"Richardsons\" it says it's open from 8am-12am everyday. I called just to be sure.  The woman told me Richardsons closes at 10pm but the sister bar next door Rokerij closes at midnight. I hang up. I called back again because I just wanted to make sure, before we drove there, that Richardsons doesn't have a last call on food since they close at 10pm and we wouldn't arrive until about 9:20pm. The woman kept repeating that they don't close till 10pm so why would they turn is away or have last call? I asked again in a couple different ways, saying I understand that but do you have last call on food? (Only because I didn't want to show up and be told it's too late) Some restaurants will have last call on food 15 minutes before they close.. She said \"then those restaurants should say they close at 945\" she also said \"We never turn anyone away\"  Cool... So to me that means, they don't have a last call on food. We show up, and I commented on how nice the place was. I've never been there, and I was curious about the happy hour as well. Server came up while wiping sweat off his forehead, looking less than thrilled and was clearly not happy about us being there. He gave me the happy hour menu and just set it down without explaining anything to me (which is fine I'll figure it out,) and said \"just so you know the kitchen closes in 5-10 minutes\"  I was confused because I had JUST called about this so I didn't have to feel rushed and uncomfortable. We asked for 5 minutes and he just walked away... I'm a server and understand people coming in last minute buttt....I had already called and was told you don't turn people away before 10. He made me extremely uncomfortable and didn't want to give them my business at that point..I was really frustrated and we just left. I was really excited to try this place and apparently the communication between the staff needs to improve so that doesn't happen again.",

Today we enjoyed a delicious brunch- enchiladas (cheese & beef) Christmas style (red&green chile), carne adovada & over easy eggs, a bowl of beans with red chile, onions & cheese, mimosas, and bloody Mary's.   All were excellent!!!  It was a beautiful day so the patio seating was full but we were able to grab a spot at the bar inside which is always a good place to sit and enjoy your meal and cocktails. Next-door, at the Rokerij, or just south on the opposite side of 16 th street, at Dick's Hideaway, sitting at the bar is definitely The way to go because you can watch as the cooks prepare your food and enjoy the wonderful smell of the pecan wood used in the grills.  Both the red and green chile are excellent- I generally prefer the red, but only slightly.  There's not a bad thing on the menu and they always have some great specials that are not on the menu- The only challenge is convincing myself to order something other than my favorites that are on the menu!",

When you pull into the parking lot it's valet only, I'm not a fan of that at all but it's complimentary and being the lots so small it's understandable. When you walk in you enter into the patio dining with lots of tables and room. The restaurant inside is extremely small and when I went it was packed, I recommend a reservation on weekends. I had to sit on the patio and it was a bit chilly. I ordered the Carne Adovado. It came with pinto beans and rice. The red chile was delicious, it was truly New Mexican no doubt. The pork was smoked which isn't in any way, shape or form New Mexican but it was extremely tender. I wasn't a fan of the smokey flavor with the red chile. True New Mexican restaurants serves chips and salsa before the meal and sopapillas with the meal. I missed that but all in all I would go back for the red chile alone.",

    "text": "We came to Richardson's/Dick's Hideaway for brunch during my whirlwind trip to pay court to Vicki and Enzo.  Brunch is the whitest of meals and it is something I often look forward to with glee.   When you get to the restaurant you'll notice that it is very small and you'll be seated family/European style (sitting with people you may not know because there is space at the table).  If that's not your bag of tricks there is a bagel shop across the street that is home to many fond memories for me and is a perfect substitute.  The room is decorated like a dusty wine cellar and is a dusty wine cellar, there was a wood fire warming the room and the set up was charming.   It took us longer to order than it did for us to decide where to go, get ready, and leave the house.  This wasn't because we couldn't decide what to eat but the waiter - I didn't catch his name but I'm thinking this is his hideaway - took forever to bring our drinks, take our order, argued with Enzo and spoke to him in a dismissive tone, lacked personality, and was fairly rude (no thank you, just walked away when Enzo was speaking).  The other thing I didn't like was kitchen door that would forcefully swing open around where people were walking.  If your kitchen door doesn't have a window and there is a chance people may be moving around it then it's a solid idea to open it gently.    I had the breakfast burrito \"Christmas style\" which meant green and red chilies.   I'll be straight up pedantic and point out that Advent and Christmas' liturgical colors are white and purple, green and red are used other times .  It was good.  The terrible service didn't distract from the good food - and sometimes it can.  My friends enjoyed their food as well.    I wouldn't suggest this place if bad service, crowded seating, or dust, bother you.  If you're cool with this or you're pretentious this will be right up your alley.",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place after learning of my Phoenix trip. Located in a semi residential area, it has a unique set up: two separate restaurants (Richardson's and the Rokerij) sharing a common covered central courtyard with its own entrances; the latter was closed when we come for lunch. My dining companion preferred the bright, open courtyard than the dark interior (it looked cozy to me). The menu offered many tempting authentic Mexican dishes. We settled for the familiar rellenos & eggs and carne adovada burrito. Food came out piping hot in a proprietary metal dish with the restaurant names engraved on it. The portions were generous and hearty. However, the unique container likely accelerated the melting of all the components (like hash browns without crunchiness sitting in oil,.blending with neighboring beans and Chile) into one wet mush . Ditto the burritos. We could barely finish half of our brunch.",

Neither of us could eat half of the dinner portion, especially after that huge salad and great appetizers.  Since we rarely leave a restaurant planning our return visit, this says much.

This was right in front of the valet stand and I wanted to park myself since all I had to do was turn my car left.  Valet parking is free so was he fishing for valet parking so he could have a tip? Disrespectful!  Next, the hostess didn't warn me about a step down to her to our table.  I almost fell but luckily caught myself. Lastly, our server was taking a long time to get our order. I had to go get her.  Then when I asked if I could have a piece of bread because I'm diabetic and was feeling my blood sugar going down, she didn't seem to understand me. I just asked for orange juice instead because I was stressed and didn't want a hypoglycemic attack. Otherwise, the food was excellent and everyone in our party really liked what they ordered. I will still go back as there are more items in the menu that I would like to try and if that one Handicap Parking is open, I would still park my car there!  If you like spicy food, then this place is a mit's try!!!!",

I would also even have some of the asparagus they throw on the plate so you can feel that you had a healthy meal.  I should be washing it all down with a bloody mary requested to be \"just a little spicy\", so that it has just enough of a spicy kick for me.  Or maybe I should branch out and have the carne adovada and eggs or huevos rancheros or anything on that wonderful brunch menu.  And maybe I should go a second time to award the coveted 5th star, just to make sure it's excellence was not a fluke.  But instead, I'm writing about it.

I was also sad that I was with a bunch of my co-workers who, when they were complaining that the food was too spicy, would have looked at me funny for stealing the remainder of THEIR dinners.   This place is an absolute winner.",

The Adovado and New Mexican Enchilada are the 2 plates I have eaten. Both were really good. I am definitely making this a spot to stop at when craving a spicy dish.

It is never a good start when on the Menu it is written \"If you order it you eat it\" To start those of us that drank soda had to send our drinks back more than once since they pour them out of 2 liters and it is flat and watered down.  Our waiter seemed clueless and a little like a deer in headlights when ever we asked about any menu item. For and example we asked what the size difference was for the large and small guacamole his answer was \"Well you know the small is well a small bowl and the Large is like a large bowl\"   When ordering a few in the group let him know that they did not like spicy food and asked what the best choice was and he directed them to the enchiladas with Red Chili Sauce. Four out of the seven of us ordered that and when the food was served it was so spicy they could not eat and and told the waiter and his response was \"do you want me to box it up for you\" No they were still hungry.   When we asked to see the manager the response was nobody new where he was and didn't know when he would be back.   He finally showed up 15 min later and would not exchange the food or comp for the uneaten meals and said that we should have seen the note on the menu that states \"If you order it you eat it\" and he does not know why the waiter would have told them the red chili enchilada's where not spicy because they were VERY spicy.   The service is awful and the food is Spicy and any restaurant that does not even try to make a customer happy is not worth the trip.   Way over priced and they treat you like crap!!",

Anyhow, our dinner for 8 went from bad- a bartender who had very good wine knowledge but then just poured my drink into a new glass after I discovered a crack in it and gave us serious attitude when questioned about the need to remake the drink....to worse- spoiled seafood with major ammonia smell.  2 stars- one for the Manager who when we finally complained took care of us properly and one for the cozy patio.  Just not sure if I can bring myself to give them another try... Sad.",

Combined with daily happy hour until 6, what's not to like?  Btw, roasted garlic plate app is great but definitely a big portion. It's a lot for two people to eat and still enjoy full entrees.

I was on a business trip, so I sat alone at the outdoor bar.  The bar tender was really friendly and whipped me up a skinny margarita (which was very refreshing).  The menu is huge and they also have a lot of specials.  I should've looked on Yelp prior to ordering to get some guidance on what was best.  I ended up with a fish special - Mahi Mahi w/ mango salsa, ranchero mashed potatoes, and broccolini.  I wanted so badly to give Richardson's four stars, but two things held me up:  1) Side salad was served w/ ranch...maybe I am being too harsh, but ranch dressing is one of the worst dressings for you and they could've offered me another alternative. 2) Mahi Mahi had a bit of a sour flavor (not sure how to describe it) and was kind of tough  Otherwise, the dish was plated very lovely - very colorful!  The mashed potatoes were served in a jalapeno.  The broccolini and asparagus were cooked perfectly and had a corn sauce over them.  The mango salsa was not very ripe, so it was not very sweet as I had expected.  I love the ambiance here and I would definitely come back to try one of their other many dishes.",

Green chili, roasted peppers, garlic, smoked meats, fish, oysters, you name it, it's all amped up here. The heat of spice here isn't bad like most New Mexican food so don't be afraid and eliminate choices. Now I know some people aren't fans of the darker atmosphere here, but let your eyes acclimate and you'll see the warm inviting dinning room. Just be sure you don't drop your keys or wallet! JK.

My guest had the Richardson's combo which was more of a brunch item - two chicken enchiladas (outstanding) and a jalapeno benedict (great ham and hollandaise - light) and a mess of tasty asparagus - would highly suggest this dish.
