It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.   Regarding the \"spice\" factor. If you are not used to eating ethnic food or spicy food, the salsa will be really hot for you so avoid it. If you are used ot eating Indian, Thai, Chinese etc. then you will actually like the sauce and question why all the other salsas in the valley are bad.    That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so.  They charge for refills on chips. They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude.   If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delcisious but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of moneyand endure horrible service.  This is one of the few places in Phoenix that I will endure bad service because the food is so good.",

The food was good, I ordered the garlic shrimp which was a house specialty and it was slightly spicy. This place is supposed to be known for spicy food and their salsas are quite spicy. I love spicy food so the hotter, the better. The garlic shrimp was good, but i didn't feel like it was anything to write home about. I also tried the mojito which was also good. They strained the mint leaves out which is kind of nice. We also tried the guacamole which tasted fresh and wen well with the spicy food. The service was fast and prompt. The night we went the place wasn't really busy so it's not like we had to really compete for attention. The decor is casual although they did have a couple of random things on the wall...i think i saw a coyote pelt hanging on the wall but the place is casual so i wasn't bothered by it. Overall it's got decent mexican food at standard prices.",

Mex is a family favorite for us... this place was recommended to us while we were here for our fist vaca in AZ. i thought we were lost because we drove through a neighborhood to get there, but sure glad we made it! This is definitely the spot if you like your food SPICY/HOT! and if you don't like too much fire, there is plenty of other items to choose also, i did. we only like to try off the \"chain\" type places, and like to get as many different ones in.. this one had us reeled in 2 or 3 times in our one stay... we couldn't stay away! the prickly pear margaritas is a a flavor we haven't come across anywhere else since... they were the best I've had... and for dessert... SOPPAPIA's all the way! if your gonna ruin ur diet w/ dessert, u have to do it right, and get them loaded with everything! they are like warm, soft pillows of heaven in your mouth! ITS A MUST! most places they are usually fried flat and to a crisp, and just so-so... here, you'll eat them til u hurl!  I KNOW!",

    "text": "Spicy food, surly servers...  I was excited to try Los Dos Molinos.  The food was spicy in accordance with the restaurant's reputation.  However, the spicy was manageable.  A person in my party has a lower heat tolerance, and she was able to order a dish that suited her taste.  The only downside was that the salsa was too spicy for her taste levels.  I had the enchiladas, which had a nice spicy kick.  They came with the usual sides of refried bean and rice - not memorable.  The guacamole was serviceable, but also not memorable.    The complaints involved the waiter.  First, he did not offer any insightful suggestions when we asked him for suggestions - since it was our first time there.  Second, he would not let me get one cheese enchilada and one chicken enchilada for the 2 enchilada combination- said that I have to get two enchiladas with the same filling.  This was pathetically inflexible.  Third, we tried to pay by splitting the check in with 3 credit cards evenly - he refused and said they only will split a check with 2 credits card evenly.  This was just another unfriendly policy that was especially odd given the lack of customers - so the waiter had amble time to split the bill into 3 payments.  The restaurant is located in a wedding plaza - I am not ready to walk down the aisle to profess my love of this location of Los Dos Molinos.",

The service was decent, though the wait staff just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  The salsas (both red and green) were easily the highlight of the visit.  I may go back just to buy the salsa.  The chile relleno wasn't bad, but the rice was clearly yesterday's leftovers and the beans had a funky vinegar taste.  The sopapillas were also not what I was  expecting.  It wasn't bad food, but it certainly wasn't the best ever, either.  The decor was cute and fun.",

We had no clue this place cooked everything super spicy, but that's exactly how I love my food so I was super duper happy. They bring you chips and 2 different salsas to start (red chili and salsa verde) and they are both spicy with chunks of chili peppers in them. We told the manager how much we loved the salsas and he went on to tell us how everything they make is from scratch, including the tortillas. I ordered the taco and red chili cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans. I'm a hard critic when it comes to enchiladas and they are super authentic and delicious here! Be warned though: the beans and the red chili sauce are really really really spicy! I wasn't expecting that kind of heat in the beans and I'm definitely paying for it right now as I type, but it was sooooo worth it. I'm a True fan and will definitely return very soon!",

There were other people out there as well, enjoying beers and margaritas and what not.  So I start looking for the bar....can't find it.  I ask the host where I can get a beer...he tells me it's impossible, because \"that part of the restaurant won't be open for another 20 minutes.\"  What?  People who have written about the uncaring, arrogant service are exactly right.  What kind of restaurant, particularly a Mexican restaurant, won't let you buy a beer on a Saturday night?  How did these other folks get served?  We decided it was too strange, and left and went to Frank and Lupe's in Scottsdale....had a great meal and good service.",

To come here and think you can order non spicy food is possible but it would be similar to going to a Sushi restaurant and ordering a hamburger.  If on the other hand you love heat and the more the better then Los Dos is for you.  I usually get the carne adovada which is cooked overnight and absolutely phenomenal.  Sometimes I will get the blue tamales or the enchilada platter or tacos.  They are also really good but nothing is better than the adovada in my book.  The green salsa and the red salsa are both very hot and delicious.  The rice and beans are also both well done.  Fluffy soft rice and flavorful beans.  Many Mexican restaurants seem to forget to make solid sides.  Los Dos does them both well.  The sopapillas are excellent too.  They come with four huge fluffy pieces sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon with a side of honey to dip them in.  Recommend to any spicy food lover.",

Wasn't a big deal but after 15 mins we still had not seen our server. Finally we called the manager over who took our drink orders and sent over a waiter. Finally ordered our food but never got our drinks. After another 20 mins the waiter came to check on us and when we told him we never got our drinks. We had to tell him what we ordered. At this point I was not willing to wait any longer and decided to go somewhere else.   For the price of the dishes I would expect better service.",

    "text": "It was a rare cloudy day in Phoenix when I visited this place. I was hoping to try what I had been told is some of the spiciest Mexican food in town.  I went despite it being in a dangerous part of town.   My friend and I arrived and the patio looked like a garage sale full of random colorful items cluttered about. Inside was a bit claustrophobic with low ceilings and decorations strewn about the walls.    The tables had odd warnings about children and drink refills that did not seem fitting for a sit down restaurant.   I ordered the Chile relleno plate.  After time our chips and salsa came. the chips were think, heavy and cold. The super hot salsa was not very spicy at all and apparently you only get one bowl as we never received any more, also quite odd for this format.  Our meals came and I was excited to try a spicy Chile however it was quite mediocre lacking much cheese filling or on top. The rice and beans were quite standard too. I would have enjoyed some salsa to put on my rice however they never bought any more.  We paid cash at the front cash register as the waiter will not handle your bill.  Overall this place seemed overpriced, low quality and a bit low brow. Go try Serrano's or Arriba for a better meal.",

Shredded beef was seasoned perfectly and the green chili was the best I've had since I lived in Colorado.  Highly recommended.",

Regardless, they have DELICIOUS Mexican food - though it does get quite spicy at times.  Everyone that works here is so nice and polite - they're always a genuine charm to talk to!  The only negative thing I can think of is the interior of the restaurant - it's a bit kitschy and cramped. However, I think this is part of the charm of the place, so take that however you want.  Overall, I couldn't recommend a better place for some hearty, flavorful Mexican food.",

I've had everything on the menu, multiple times, and my favorites are the Mexican Pizza, Carnitas, Garlic Shrimp, and the Red Beef Burro Enchilada Style. The Jalapeno green salsa is incredible as well.   They serve up some great margaritas, though for the best margs, visit the Washington Street location as they seem to be better at mixing. There is a reason Los Dos has been around for as long as it has, and has received all of it's national press.",

The food is incredibly spicy but lacks quality and actual flavor.  It's as if they spiced up the food so they can sell you more margaritas.  If you wanna go just to get messed up on margaritas, which you kinda end up doing while you're waiting to either be seated or served your food, then the place is perfect for you.    Unless you're a tourist - don't expect any decent customer service.  The place is an old mortuary redone into a restaurant.

    "text": "As an Arizona native I was excited to try the Phoenix location on central; as I had already tried the Mesa location and was a bit underwhelmed. I was hoping that the Phoenix location would impress me and live up to the rumors I had heard.  The server was fast and reasonable polite, and after ordering two combo platters (beef burro and chicken burror) the food was out in under ten minutes.  This was surprising, as I expected a longer wait do to the self proclamation of all food made to order.  Unfortunately, this was the last pleasant experience here.         I would like to claim that the food was just ok, but in truth it was pretty awful. The chicken was dry and had a slightly rotten taste to it as if it been sitting around for a few days.  the beans were undercooked, crunchy in fact.  The rice was okay but it seems very dry and tasteless, even after dumping half of the salsa on top of it.  My father's beef burro faired none better as he referred to it as \"mushed up cat food\".        As an active man of large stature (6'4 240lbs), it is rare for me to leave a meal unfinished, but in this instance, I found myself abandoning the plate and retreating hungry and unhappy.  If this was a bargain priced restaurant I would be more understanding, but for 12 dollars I expect more than boiled chicken, undercooked beans, and tasteless rice.  Oh, and they unknowingly charge you $1 per small chip bowl which you find on your bill when you pay....for shame!  Save your time and visit one of the many glorious Mexican restaurants in the area, just not here.  But if you do, worry not on seeing me as I shall never return!",

It is New Mexico cuisine and makes extensive use of the famous Hatch Chile that is cultivated only in the Hatch valley of New Mexico.  With that said, this restaurant has become part of my weekly dining experience (for over 15 years now). You will never find a more flavorful or rewarding \"Mexican\" meal as long as you live, I've tried throughout the country.  One word of advise, once you've tried Los Dos you will never be satisfied with another \"Mexican\" restaurant. It has ruined an entire category of dining for me. I am so disappointed with all others that I can not enjoy them. I must return to Los Dos on a weekly basis to get my fix. There was even a period of two years in which I moved out of the Phoenix area and went to the extreme of scheduling flight layovers on my business trips destine for other parts of the country in order to dine here.  I frequent the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area and place Los Dos in the top ten of this city's best.  The wait can be extensive, especial on the weekends and the serve is often lacking to one degree or another, but it simply adds to the atmosphere and the overall experience within the walls of Tom Mix's old homestead (those of more advanced years may appreciate this knowledge).  Enjoy!  Oh Yeah! You better love it HOT!",

So my husband and I were in the neighborhood and wanted Mexican food, we were on our way to La Canasta on 7th street but they do not have strong drinks so I suggested we stop in.  When you enter it feels like you have been transported to a little Villa. So we sit down the place is half full. There was this man literally licking his plate,  I was thinking damn is the food that good.  So we ordered beer ritas. We asked our waiter about the hottest dish they had.  He pointed out a couple but they had spicy boneless ribs on the menu so I asked, \"what kind of Mexican restaurant has ribs?\" He said it was not Mexican it is New Mexico cuisine.  I was thinking in my head what is the difference, because he said it with so much pride.  So I studied the \"New Mexico\" menu and order a burrito...lol. my husband got some spicy Shrimp dish. The chips and salsa came out with the beer ritas which only come frozen. The salsa was so spicy and delicious maybe top 3 salsa I have ever eaten.  The drink was full of goodness. The food came out quick.  It was so goood and I added that spicy salsa it was over the top. Then the bill came it was 19.00. I thought it was a mistake. I asked my husband to guess how much he said 50.00. We were thrilled.  We saw a couple eating sopapias spelling my b off. So we ordered some they were fresh and sweet and good and...you get the picture.  I will be back for sure.",

Two of us went on a Saturday afternoon when there were only two other tables of people in the entire restaurant, and similar to other reviewers' experiences, we stood at the front for a while before we were seated, and then it took another 10 minutes for the server to come over and ask us if we wanted drinks.  When we complained that we had been sitting there for 10 minutes, the waitress copped an attitude and acted as if she were doing us a favor by taking our orders.  The food was blah -- nothing to get excited about.  The only good thing about this place is the margaritas, but they're not good enough for me to go back!",

    "text": "So-so food, bad service and great margaritas. It seems to me that the quality of the food and the customer service at this palce gets worse and worse every time I go there. We went on a Saturday at around 1pm, 4 people in our party.  The place was not busy.  We walked in and it took at least 3-5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and showed us to our table.  Workers would walk by the door and saw us standing there, but no one even said \"we'll be right with you\" or anything! Once seated, the water and chips arrived right away...the guy who sat us down never told us he was not our actual server, so we sat there for about 10-15 minutes and he never came back to take our order.  Finally, I called him over to our table and told him we were ready to order, and VERY rudely, he said, \"oh, she will take your order...WHEN SHE GETS A CHANCE!\", pointing to one of the waitresses.  She came by to take our order a few minutes later.  The food was OK, but it used to be better.  They use pre-made taco shells for their tacos...seriously?!  So much for authentic Mexican Food.  The only thing I really enjoyed during this last visit was the margaritas...those continue to be delicious :-)",

The Margaritas were off the chain awesome, we ordered the Raspberry and Mango margaritas. The flavors were spot on and they were sauced, let me tell you. We favored the red chile salsa with the chips they gave us, but you get both red and green chile and they're both ridiculously delicious to be honest. And our entrees were of the charts good, he got the Veracruz Shrimp and I got the Blue Corn Enchiladas with chicken and green chile sauce. The food service was speedy and courteous. Zero complaints, best lunch ever! The patio was packed when we arrived so we sat inside, there was plenty of seating inside, and the ambiance is fantastic!",

I've never had a bad meal here. I haven't had real Mexican food in awhile since I moved and Los Dos once again did not disappoint. This last visit I chose the enchiladas with the fried egg on top, rice and beans. The green sauce is to die for and the rice and beans were absolutely perfection.  My friend had the flautas and they were equally as awesome.  Go!  I wouldn't steer you wrong!",

The food is ALWAYS spot on and truly legit as far authenticity is concerned. The staff is very attentive and they always do a great job of making their customers feel welcome and cared for. When my family comes into town Los Dos is the first place that they want to go. The atmosphere, food, and service is top notch and has NEVER disappointed me.

You can get food ranging from incredibly mild to wildly spicy.  Everything we've had is delicious.  Whenever we are there, the staff always works as a team.  While you have a dedicated server for your meal, you will also likely encounter many more staff as they take your drink order, fill your water, stop and chat etc.  Everyone there clearly loves what they do, and it shows in the quality of their service and of their food.  You won't be disappointed, give them a try!",

The server suggested I tried half regular beans and half spicy (since I said I love beans and didn't feel like rice) and the beans were delicious.  One friend ordered a red chile enchilada- I had a bite and was tempted to order one to take home for lunch the next day.  There was a great birthday celebration at the table next to us.

The person I was with ordered a bean tostada and a taco. The beef taco was nothing more than beef fat and lettuce. Gross was an understatement. The tostada was literally pinto beans from a can dumped on top of a store bought tortilla with some lettuce. No cheese, spices anything. We went there for lunch. The bill was $27.00 not including a tip.  I love spicy food but this place is crazy. Everything is super hot in an effort to burn your taste buds so you can't taste the food.

    "text": "Meh!!!  I really wanted to give this place 1 star, but there was something I did like about this restaurant...... the diet coke! lol  I can get over bad service, which we did have, but the food was bleh! Way too spicy and pretty small for the price. I ordered a beef tamale and beans. The tamale was about a third of the size it should be and looked like someone had slapped it on the plate and put hot sauce on top to cover up the job. I am not a fan of whole beans, I like 'em refried. So, after burning my tongue and trying to get full off of the greasy chips I gave up.   We actually had to go and get food somewhere else after we left. We were still hungry because most of our party of 5 did not eat the \"food\" we were served. I definitely will not be back.   ps... they charge for soda and iced tea refills! I knew when I read that on the menu I was not going to be happy with this place.",

    "text": "It's probably no surprise but, we can't get Mexican food like this in Savannah. I'm not an expert, but this seemed so authentic and fresh, albeit very, very spicy.   Margaritas (two pitchers consumed by three of us) were made with just squeezed lime juice instead of the sweet syrupy mix every Mexican place serves back home. The corn chips were fresh fried hot rather then reheated, or worse room temperature, as in Savannah. And, they actually tasted like corn! Their guacamole got three thumbs up, with one diner abstaining saying he felt it was too mellow. The others, by the way, saw it as a good counterpoint to the red and green chili salsas, which were judged hot and hotter..   Two, of our party of four, were sensitive to spicy food. It should be noted that although Los Dos Molinos' menu is careful to annotate spicy food as such, that the majority of their offerings fall under this category. Our two gringos with mild tastes ordered the carnitas (slow cooked pork) and chicken flautas with guacamole and sour cream. (Curiously, he felt the flautas needed more flavor.) The remaining two diners (one female/one male) were eager to \"man up\", respectively ordering the adovada ribs in red chili and the enchilada dinner with chicken, red chili and a fried egg. Both were highly appreciated and savored with great relish, although there was a price to pay throughout the wee hours of the following morning for this writer.   To add to the attack upon our four digestive systems, we opted to split an order of the sopapilla with everything, aka deep fried dough with honey, sugar and Cinnamon. Very tasty indeed.  Service was prompt, pleasant and especially helpful in assisting us as we worked our way through a menu peppered with chili IEDs. The kitchy environment seemed a bit out of context, but was fun none the less. Some might consider pricing a tad high, our bill before tip was just over $100, but it was supported by the quality of the food, and we drank alot.   I'd return to Los Dos Molinos in a heartbeat, although I'd be sure to stock up on Pepcid first.",

    "text": "Ok so this place is controversial... You either love it or hate it.  The food is GREAT, especially if you love SPICY food. The menu marks the stuff that is hot, and it is no joke, its HOT. But very tasty. The hottness kind of depends on the day I have found, some days it like liquid magma, and otheres its got a good kick. I have had the Adobada ribs, the enchiladas, the machaca, the chimichanga. All good. Sometimes the beans are even spicy. You can get your meals with either red or green chile, I am told that the green is hotter, but that is up for debate.  On to the not so good: The service is at best mediocre, especially if they are busy and its a weekend. Dont go here if you are in a hurry. But for us, the food is worth the bad service. Consider yourself warned... Also they dont have much of a kids menu, our 2 year old has snacked on rice and beans (when the beans are not spicy) and a cheese crisp and the rolled tacos on occasion. Thats about the extent of it, everything else is spicy.  This is not completely authentic mexican food, its more of a southwestern flare. No carne asada here.  The Kick-Ass Margarita is awesome (so my husband says) and I like the Sangria and the Sangria Margarita. Margatitas overall are good here.",

You can't choose what level of spicyness to get: it's either SUPER CRAZY SPICY or not spicy at all.  I figured we trekked all the way out here to try real tex-mex in its full spicy gloriousness...but regretted it afterwards. Perhaps my palatte is just really wimpy and I can't appreciate the food but I do not feel the need to ever return again. Also, the sangria was so-so although it was a generous tall glass.  The people who own this place, however, were really super nice and the decor....well...it's one of a kind.  : )",

I may not be hispanic dude, but I'm 43 years old and I grew up and have lived within a few miles of the border ALL MY LIFE. I know what an enchilada is MF'er. I've traveled the world. I've eaten some of the scariest food in the darkest corners of this beautiful world and I have never in my life had such terrible food. Eastern Europe, Central America, South America, could never have invented the vial slop that these knuckleheads are parading as food. Everyone who ate the food this evening are doubled over the toilet RIGHT NOW MF'ers. We drove an hour to eat this shit. Guess what was difficult not doing after eating your food?

Have been eating sumptuous Enchiladas before we're introduced with Adovada Ribs.  One thing to note though, the service is moderate, don't expect great service. Service can be iffy at times dependent on the mood of the boss-girl, and hence impacting the server's mood as well, but so far we've been lucky, a server told us sometimes it impacts the food as well.   Will be going there again (once my Costa Rican friend comes during their business visit).",

The bad - our server sucked. He had a personality of a robot. He barely did any of the work either. He just took our order. The nice busboy seemed to do the rest. - this place really nickel and dimes you. They charge you for a chips and salsa refill. And they only provide one free refill of soda.  - prices are kind of high for how small the portions are. My plate had one small chili relleno and a small amount of rice and beans. My husband's plate was really tiny. Mexican food should not be this expensive! - the bathrooms had NO toilet paper in either stall. And were really dirty. - stomach issues afterwards. Maybe it was because of the spice level, I don't know. But it was an unpleasant night of sleep.",

I even asked if they even wanted us there and he flat out said \"I don't care\".  Considering the location and my past fondness, our party of 8 stayed... I had been talking this place up to my friends from Peru and Colombia.  Should have known from the start...the food ended up being lously...and not a little, 4 of us got no sleep from cramping.  I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel for our red sauce, it looked more like spicy red paste.  Sad to say this is the end of an era for me, I WILL NEVER go back.  This was the only restaurant I would welcome a 1 hour wait for a table at...no longer.

The food is good, the green chili pork at $15 tastes great, but is over priced.  All the food here is priced high in my opinion.  Mexican lunch menu at that price doesn't make sense.    After all that:  I really like the receipts they serve (after all they are Los Dos).   I like the spice, so if you like the heat and don't mind the price, I'd say try it for yourself.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants ever, and I love the south Phoenix location.  My favorite is the adovada relleno.  The relleno is delicious and the adovada is perfection, slow roasted, flavorful and tender.  Pretty much everything here is spicy (recommend a margarita to curb the fire!  I love the mango and the prickly pear), but I think there are a few things (chicken, shrimp) that aren't too spicy.    Everything here is cheesy and saucy and just perfect.  Another favorite is the beef enchiladas with an egg on top.  Weekends are busy, expect to wait if you arrive after 6pm, but get a drink and some chips and salsa and hang out in the courtyard.  Weeknights are less crowded.  (Except during spring training, when everything is crowded!)",

I could sum up my review of Los Dos Molinos by a statement the slightly intoxicated gentleman sitting next to me blurted out on my 1st visit here. And here goes:  I just saw Jesus in my beans.  Done.  Well, the beans he almost saw Jesus in were those on the plate of the Adovada Ribs. Hot. Hot. Hot. Way too delicious.  Not the ribs dish you're envisioning, you create mini burritos with this dish of spicy deliciousness.   A local favorite. An out-of-towner never forget! I always go back whenever I'm in town...  Tell Jesus HI ... ;)",

    "text": "I had heard great things about this place as I've struggled to find a single decent Mexican restaurant in this area. I'll have to come back to give a fair shake via a burro. But the food my wife and I had today was awful. Their salsas are sub par. They taste artificial. But the chicken taco and shredded pork taco was atrocious. Two greasy yellow corn soft tacos with small bits of unseasoned boiled meat, way too much lettuce, some cheese and a couple tomato wedges. My wife described here tostada as several layers of tasteless ingredients. Like I said, I won't judge it until I've tried a burro, since this is a norteno style place. But if you can't handle a decent taco and you're a Mexican joint, you got issues. Although we hate Taco Bell, we both agreed that a bean burrito from Taco Bell would have been better. Isn't there one good Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa area?? Maybe I need to only find those divey taquerias in Mexican neighborhoods. But so far Dos Molinos is thumbs down. C'mon guys, do better.",

I LOVE spicy food, and it's hard for me to find a place that has salsa that is spicy enough for my taste buds...  that is until I found this amazing place.  Their salsa is not for the faint of heart- so beware- also no free refills on the salsa, but it's worth paying extra for, in my opinion.  The margaritas are yummy- they don't douse it in sweet and sour mix and lime juice.  Service is not great but not horrible either. I just go for the food- which is what restaurants should be about anyways.",

The sangria tastes like they murdered an entire hibiscus bush to make it, but is strangely very good. I would however stay away from the margaritas, they are pretty watery. They have a sign inside that says \"Please control your kids\". AWESOME! the last thing I want is a bunch of screaming brats running around while I am trying to enjoy a meal. Now for the complaints - the staff is incredibly rude and pretentious, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, the tables are too close together, the decor is gaudy and the food will burn a hole in your mouth going in and going out... well enough said. Even though the service is poor the experience and food are a must try for any Arizonian.",

    "text": "Great NM-style food.  I think I've been to nearly every location, including the original in Springerville, and this is the best.  I've been here many times and had only one iffy experience at Los Dos: the food was mediocre and (gasp) NOT TOO SPICY when we went several months ago.  But don't worry, we just went again a few weeks ago, and all is well.  I ordered my usual cheese enchiladas with fried egg on top and enjoyed a Bohemia beer to help wash down the hot salsa and spicy enchilada sauce.  Yes, I will return.  And I recommend the same for you.  Just remember that on busy Friday/Saturday nights, you can expect to enjoy several margaritas in the courtyard as you wait to be seated.  They take no reservations and this is a popular gem in the South Mountain area.",

I ordered the Adovado ribs and it was ultra spicy and ultra good, literally melts in  your mouth and my buddy ordered the tacos (just okay)...  and I got a yummie Margarita - it was a night club in mouth and with the noise, seriously could not concentrate...

    "text": "Los Dos Molinos has some of the blandest food I've had.  Some people are claiming it to be too spicy, it's not.  This spice is the only hint of flavor in their dishes.  I ordered the Chili Con Queso appetizer, which was a lukewarm microwaved Velveeta like cheese with a spoonful of salsa added.   Even plain Velveeta has more flavor than this.  I had to add more of the salsa to gain any hint of flavor.  For entrees, we had tacos and tamales.  Again, lacking any sort of flavor and all of it only slightly warmer than room temperature.  My tamale was similar to a bland soggy cornbread muffin sitting on top of a thin strip of roasted green chili.  The rice and beans were terrible.  White rice that is dirty, probably from the age.  Beans weren't refried, my guess...canned pinto beans.    The interior of this place is disgusting.  Old, dusty flower arrangements stapled to the wall.  I don't expect much at a place like this but when the guest seating area is filthy, one can only imagine the kitchen.   I was completely blown away at the prices.  However, for some reason, my check wasn't as high as I was expecting, maybe I was looking at the dinner menu.  Even for what I paid I'll never go back.  I'll stick to Filiberto's or Panchos for some flavor.  Wish I could leave less than 1 star.",

If you don't get there right when they open at 5, prepare to wait. And it might be a loooong wait. When you finally do get called in, there's about 12 different dining rooms you could be sitting in. Sure, they're all eclectic, but some are downright strange. The main dining room, with all kinds of crap hanging from the ceilings, is excellently atmospheric, in a kitschy sort of way.   As far as the grub, the New Mexican chilies they use are killer. They'll attack your taste buds throughout the meal, but they provide rich, complex flavors that can't be beat. The salsas, both the red (burn-your-ass hot) and the green (semi-burn-your-ass hot) are both as flavorful as any I've had. I get everything covered in the green, and I order a lot of margaritas. They come just as strong as the salsas.",

Maybe it's because I lived in Chicago, but this has never even crossed my mind, especially when confronted with the incredibleness that is the stacked enchiladas.  Take a step back, order a sangria, snack on some chips and prepare your mouth... no--your whole body for this.  The first bite of these stacked enchiladas (always order them with green chile, might I add) will knock your socks off.  Literally.  (Side note: if you see one of my socks...)  The place has gotten a bit too busy, but it's still well worth the wait.  Or, for those not content to drink sangria while waiting for a table, you can check out the Mesa one; I've never had to wait long there, but it just doesn't have the same character.  I look forward to visiting the suburban sprawl that is the Phoenix metro area each year, and this is in no small part because of this place.  Los Dos makes a mean, spicy, enchilada.",

    "text": "I say I will never return after waiting 1.5 hours to eat mediocre food, but I do it anyway, Maybe it is me hoping that It will be better the next time I go. It was as disappointing as the last 8 times have been there!  Had friends in town visiting and they wanted to meet and eat there. We got there with a large group, and was told if we call an hour ahead of time, we would be OK. Wrong! It was a Saturday night and of course it was busy. So I understand that. The wait is not bad because of the bar outside, but $3 for chips and salsa? $21 for a pitcher of Ice and Sangria (more ice)? luckily there are comfy seats to consume the overpriced drinks with a bunch of grouchy hungry people!   Finally a gentleman from our group went in and said we would squeeze into a corner booth if they let us. That is what we did. I did not mind the squeezing, actually it was kinda fun. But after we ordered the drinks and then waiting for a waiter who was a smart ass - It was getting old.   The interior is cool, the booths are an old carved wood and with all the crap on the walls, you know there is some history. The patio is comfy in the springtime, but feels like the owners took their old patio furniture to work. There is plenty of places to sit, but it is someway awkward. Careful, You might turn an ankle on the patio with all the chairs.  Ordered the Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with Red Chile. I know this place is not a New Mexican style place. My family roots are in New Mexico and I know what is Hot and good New Mexico cooking. So I do not know why I expected that from my order. The food came and is was not a heaping large portion of rice and beans and entree like you normally get. I thought that was chincy.   I dug into the meal and found the tortilla to look like it was a dyed blue, not a real blue corn tortilla! My wife's order came with rice and she barely got a spoonful portion. WTH? Where was the meat? The rice use to be hot too, but someone must have raised hell that it made all the food so spicy that there was no flavor. Now it is a normal mexican food place boring rice. Although spicy, everyone was on the clean plate club, not because it was not good, but because we were starving!   One person in the group ordered the Tamale, and it looked REALLY GOOD! She said it was good.   Dinner at 6:30 - it was not going to happen. We finally left at 9:45! Everyone left kinda disappointed. I left muttering the same words... never again!",

    "text": "Los Dos rocks.  Even if you have to wait for two hours, it is still worth it.  Prepare to wait.  Hang out on the patio and drink some beers and soak up the great company you hopefully came with.  If you are getting attitude from the people that work there, it is probably because you are being rude, acting idiotic, or are just plain clueless.    The food at Los Dos is like nothing else.  I generally prefer the specials (posted on the plastic surfboard), because I think they are super fresh, unique, and almost always amazing.  My favorite dishes from the menu are the garlic shrimp, the adovada ribs, and the Victoria's chili chicken plate-green.  However, the all-time greatest dish at Los Dos is the Angela's Special.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The Angela's Special is a chicken breast that is slowly cooked in a chili, topped with jalapeno-tomatillo sauce and cheese, and served over plain rice, with beans and tortillas on the side.  It is the most delicious thing ever...spicy yet flavorful, moist and flaky at the same time, and just wonderful.  If you are lucky enough to experience the Angela's Special, your life will improve...it is that good.  Do I even have to talk about how fantastic the salsas are, or how great the Herradura margarita can be?  No, try it for yourself.  I will say, however, that the snacks and margaritas are not as fresh on the patio as they are inside (which is why I suggest beer on the patio), so if you can wait until you get inside, you will be rewarded.  Now, I have heard that there have been some changes going on with who is running each Los Dos, and all I can say is that if Cheryl is around, everything will be that much better...",

    "text": "I finally went there with someone who was willing to both eat amazingly hot food and wait as long as possible.  And wouldn't it just figure that for the first time, there was no wait.  I don't know what good Karma I had going, but we walked right into the place.  Sure it was a Thursday, but come on!!    So, yea. It's hot.  But you knew it would be hot.  What I didn't hear so much about was how it manages to be really really good while not doing anything \"special\".  Our plain Cheese Quesadilla was amazing - but it was just cheese and tortilla.  But they managed to cover the ENTIRE thing with thick yummy cheese - and no big bubbles either - yet the tortilla was still 100% crisp.  Everything was like that.  Describing it might not sound exceptional, until you realize how rare those things are to find all in one place.  And their mexican rice had the most amazing taste - neither of us could place which spices we were tasting that were so different.    Outside is a mess of tables and chairs that HAVE to be there when they are packed, but it looked a bit like Coney Island in the off season to go through there when no one else was there.    Personal tip?  If you are worried about the spice of your dish - get it with the sauce on the side.  That's where all the heat is.  My companion did that with the Chimi and found it to be the perfect way to make sure she got all the flavor of the sauce, without being overwhelmed by it in every single bite.",

    "text": "Last time we were in Phoenix we ate at the Mesa location (the Phoenix restaurant was closed) and loved it--  friendly people, fiery New Mexico style food, general good times. We vowed to visit the mothership on our next visit. Before heading out, I checked the yelp and got a little concerned; based on the reviews I worried our Phoenix Los Dos outing was going to involve one or more of the following: -rude staff -loud rooms -bad crowds -overpriced, gimmicky food that was supposed to be \"tex-mex\"  Still, our first Los Dos experience was so good (and the place came recommended by none other than R.W. Apple of the damned NYT) that we forged ahead.  All I can say is, I don't know where the heck all y'all folks have been eating, 'cause in my experience Los Dos has: -a bitchin' patio with lots of random seats/tables/furnishing/stuff -fun other patrons who are happy to be there and fun to be around -perfectly nice staff who are friendly, efficient, and considerate -excellent New Mexico style food, which we should note is NOT Mexican and NOT Tex-Mex. Nor is it supposed to be.  We enjoyed the cheese crisp, adovado ribs, shrimp veracruz, some margs and the massively hot salsa(w/chips). Everything was quite good-- the crisp was airy and flavorful, the shrimp well cooked (not over or under done) and tasty, and the salsa painful but also delightful. The star of the meal, however, was the order of ribs which were tender and infused with red chili flavor.  It's True that the food at Los Dos is hot as hell-- we were sweating a few bites in to our meal, and both of our appetites shut down sooner than they do under \"normal\" circumstances. I suppose this could get in the way of a particularly sensitive person enjoying the other flavors of the meal. That being said, the folks at Los Dos can cook, and if you can hang through the heat a visit to Los Dos is well worth the pain.",

The food can be too hot!  There are not options to get the food a bit less hot (spicy!), so you have to be prepared for the spicy hot - but the flavor is well worth it!  I recently had the posole which was fantastic - and it is one of the few places outside of New Mexico where you can finish a meal off with Sopapillas (always a treat!).  Overall, I highly recommend Los Dos Molinos (but be prepared for even the menu items not marked as spicy to have some heat! - but great flavor!!).",

Dominique who I found out is supposedly the owner said the kitchen closes at 9 and repeatedly told us and it closes at 9. Got charged $1.50 for and extra tortilla. She returned the $1.50 in cash and said I needed it more once I complained. I then went to write on the receipt why I was late and say customer service is important. She walked up to me and said if I'm writing something bad on the receipt that she's the owner and its going straight to her anyways. I then got up and turned my phone on to record to tell her that it's not ok to treat customers like that especially after spending $50 for 2 people. She said that customers shouldn't come towards closing time and I said then you should close at 8:30. She said bye and don't come back. I came back to tell her that I was recording the whole thing than Omar who works there said to put the phone away and I said why?  People need to know this is how the owner treats her customers. He said Fuck you and walked away in front of Dominique the owner. I would 100% not recommend this restaurant to anyone and they deserve to close down. Honestly who says don't come back and allows their staff to say fuck you. I have the video and will be posting it online soon. Hopefully it will catch on and put that place on the spotlight to know the CUSTOMER is important and without the customer they are nothing!!!!  Worst experience I've ever had.

Out of town guests I've taken, who aren't into anything spicy, have found it to be very good.

You can wait a long time for a table, so be prepared to wait, but if you go during off times, like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you shouldn't have a wait.

    "text": "I have no idea how I lived here so long and have never eaten at this location. It seems sacrilegious. I even worked at the Pointe when it was located at South Mountain for many years and still never went to this Phoenix staple. I was determined to go today since I had an event nearby.    If you like Tex Mex then you might not agree with my three stars and I say go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars- probably one of the better ones in town. Wow, they even won a Zagat. I'm impressed.   Pros-   *Spicy-- Yum *Chile Rellenos- Huge meal for A La Carte, but that could be a con- too much food. They were tasting okay. Spicy yes but you could still taste the ingredients. That can be a trick in itself to get it right. *Great salsa/hot sauce- I did not find this salsa very hot though, weird. I liked the salsa a lot. I worked at a lot of Mexican restaurants in my day and I am picky in this regard. *Guacamole is not that bad for a Tex Mex restaurant. Not the best but good.  *Wonderful funky decor. It is like a mini Mexican village. Very eclectic.  *Carlos is amazing! * I liked that they serve water in actual beer glasses and left me an entire pitcher of water for myself. It was very hot today and their food is pretty spicy.  * Their bathrooms are cool.   Cons-  * The door was locked or hard to open when I got there. Good thing I called and did not leave. Since I was the only one there at the time I thought they were closed.  *the girl who sat me and first served me was not very friendly *far away in the middle of nowhere, at least for me.  *very spicy if you are a lightweight. lol I am not but if you are, beware. Please, ask the server what you should order instead. I overheard him tell others they do have mild choices.  * I found this restaurant to be very expensive browsing the menu.   I asked about the gift shop and Carlos laughed at me. He then told me it was closed 14 years ago. I swear I read somewhere they had a gift shop. Oh well. Ha-ha to me. The birthday gift has to be purchased elsewhere, \"friend who will remain nameless for now.\"",

    "text": "I have been eating at Los dos for years and there was a time I would have given the New Mexico chile inspired (Los dos Molinos means the two grinders a reference to grinding Chile)  themed restaurant 6 stars if that was an option. Their self proclaimed motto \"some like it hot\" is an understatement and an anthem there is not spicier more flavorful green and red chile anywhere in the valley.  Unfortunately over the years consistency of product has suffered. Recently as many amazing meals like the one I had today as awful ones that had me swearing I would never come back. For this reason I must knock off 1 star....when it's good it's great and I would and will take the chance again and again.  The chile and margaritas are why you go here if you don't like spicy, don't go...there islots of flavor but it is also HOT. You can also order any dish \"Christmas style\" which means you want both red and green chile, only way to go IMO.   Finally get a designated driver your going to want to suck down the amazing and high octane margaritas to put that fire out and after 2 walking is hard and driving out of the question.",

If you like traditional meals and salsa that is actually spicy, this is the place.   Customer service means something to this establishment. You'll be treated as well (if not better) than you treat them. Smile and thank them and they'll jump for you!   Best plate in my opinion is the Carnitas. It's always juicy and the beans and rice never miss. I've had just about everything on their menu and nothing made me want to send it back.  Margaritas? Yup! And they do them by the pitcher if you want!! This place is a win!",

The oridgenal location was up in Springerville,(AZ) I have not ever been to that one, but have friends that have and all say it too is great. This was a place opened by family. I think that is why it is so good. The name translates to The Two Grinders. The story goes that both the husband and wife had a meat grinder that they brought into the family that had been passed down through the generations. So they decided on that name because, it was cool and it is.  This location is the home (ranch) of an old Cowboy Movie Star. Though I cannot remember his name right now. Ask when you go. It is a great place. Lots of cool decour. The food is nice and spicy. New Mexico style spicy, which is a little different than Mexican style foods. They start you out with some chips and salsa. One Green, and one Red. Both delish, if you can take the heat. The sauses are really good, fresh and tasty. Everything you get there,mmm! Of course they are famous for their Margaritas, the strongest out there, I think. It is worth your time to give this place the once over.",

I paid my bill, but she never returned with my change (I prefer to tip the waiter directly) and completely ignored us after we all paid our bills.  As I said, the food was delicious, but not so good that I would come back for more of the same bad service and bad behavior.",

Margaritas are amazing, the food is so good and authentic and spicy, and the ambiance is awesome.  The service always sucks, so if you have an impatient mother-in-law, take her elsewhere.  Now that you know that, it is absolutely worth it.  pop an extra xanax, slug down a margarita on the patio (if, of course, you have a sense of reckless abandon and good health insurance) and wait for the glory.  If the words \"Machaca Crispies\" are on the specials board, ask for at least two of them.  Even if you are by yourself.  Especially if you are by yourself.  Everything on the menu is tasty; you really can't go wrong.  I brought my mother, sister and her two babies here.  When my mother asked the overly busy waiter which of the salsas were mild, I was tickled when he took a moment of his time to look at her with mildly disgusted contempt and reply, \"Neither.\"  For that, five stars.",

    "text": "Ay ay ay ay!  This place has so many crazy rules!  Two are listed below...  1. can't usually accommodate big parties unless the party has 25 people or more and then the banquet room can be used.  For a party of 18, this was a bit frustrating but we were there for a birthday party and wasn't going to stress about it.  2.  When you order a pitcher of margarita, you can only have four glasses.  So for six, you have to order two pitchers! not a bad rule, I guess, but is there a need for this rule at all?  I was forewarned that the food is especially spicy.  I can attest with minor burns on my tongue from the salsa as evidence.  I am sensitive to spicy food but was really intent on trying the house specialty, adovada, which is as spicy as the salsa.  I ordered chimichanga with beef adovada a la carte, since I was full from chips and spicy salsa and two pitchers of margarita!  I also asked for a side salad but they don't serve side salad, so the server offered to add extra lettuce garnish on the plate.  My chimichanga was plated on a platter with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce surrounding it.  WOW for the lettuce garnish.  Was it prescience, common sense, or clairvoyance that made me order a pile of lettuce with my meal?  Whatever the impetus for this action, it was a smart move as the adovada was on the salty side, packed with spicy heat!  If you take the salt away, it would just be spicy.  If you take the spice away, it would just be salty.  Chili peppers do have a flavor to them, and I like it when that tartness, or bitter-sour flavor comes through, and the spice envelopes it in texture.  The spiciness was so poignant that it numbed my tongue a bit, unable to taste, and which could explain why it was salted the way it was.  The additional sides of the lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole really rounded out the chimi, and I ended up enjoying my meal.  the third pitcher of margarita could have helped reach the level of enjoyment.  Los Dos Molinos seems to be a favorite place but for reasons of which I am not certain.  I liked my meal, but was not spectacular, the prices were not so good that I would come back for cheap eats, the location was too far to add to my rotation...  My rec, is to go with three other people, (four total) who like the adrenaline rush of super spicy salsa.",

But the service was terrible. The people next to us stopped the mgr and asked could he take their order. He did but when we asked the same thing he said he would be right back. No one came for 30 minutes. So now we were there for almost 2 hours with nothing ordered. Once we did order they served me the Shrimp Veracruz with store bough tortillas. I asked what happened to the homemade. I was then brought homemade but told for my particular meal THE OWNER said to serve store bought. Really? My dish is the most expensive item on the menu. So why skimp. The food was good but the service was terrible. Also my friend never got his taco. Our server acted as if we were an inconvenience. No worries because I will NEVER GO BACK there.",

Come here for the food:  The absolute best Mexican in Phoenix.    Their salsas are great, although the red was a bit salty for my liking. Highest recommendation to the green chile smothered pork burrito which is a house special probably 3 days a week.  Man it is good.  Most of the food is super super (super) uber spicy.  The Garlic Shrimp over rice is one exception... even the tacos have some heat to them.  During the summer, it is a bit of a pain in the arse to come here... the restaurant is cramped, so you have to wait outside.  Also, don't come here on Sundays, the place is closed.  We've eaten here with a newborn, and the staff treated us very well.... in fact he really enjoyed looking at all of the chili pepper lights on the ceiling.",

    "text": "We went here on a Friday night, hearing from someone that it has great authentic Mexican food AND seeing in New Times that they received Best Margarita in Phoenix 2011... Um, No. Yelpers are totally right when they say the service isn't very good. This location is very small and we waited at least an hour for the two of us. If the food was outstanding, then it wouldn't really matter, but that's a big if. The green corn tamale was so utterly spicey I couldn't even taste it. The beef taco was boring. It was a just a plain crispy taco shell like you'd get at Taco Bell! I expected a Filibertos style taco shell, mmm. Most importantly, and most disappointing, was the margarita! New Times was bought off to put this place as the best margarita in Phoenix. It totally sucked! Strong, but bad. I can think of four places off the top of my head with the best margaritas: Z Tejas, Sidebar, Four Peaks, and La Grande Orange Pizzaria. I give the place 2 stars cause the rice was good and for people who love spicey food, this place would probably be satisfying.",

Great family owned business that delivers on authentic Mexican taste.   The shredded beef taco, the creamy chicken plate, and the flan was all off the hook.  The spot is off of Scottsdale blvd, but it is worth the drive where ever you are coming from.  Only if they served carnitas....",

We got there around 5 and got right in, but by the time we left there was a 20-30 minute wait, so get there early.  It was cold and rainy so we sat inside, but it has a huge patio that would be pretty nice on a warm sunny day.  I got a special recommended by the server which was a chile relleno with carne adovada, and a green corn tamale on the side.  Both were pretty awesome, the pork is super tender and melts in your mouth, and the chile was coated with egg batter, cheese and green chile sauce, tasty.  The tamale was soft and simple, just how they should be, again covered with the chile sauce and cheese.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas with blue corn tortillas in red sauce, topped with fried egg.  Never seen the egg on top before but it was really good, break the yolk and let it become part of the sauce.  The beans were pretty good and the rice has a good bite to it as well.      I also had a couple of margaritas, nothing special but plentiful, giant glasses.  The food defiantely had a little spice to it but nothing like i had expected after hearing everyone talk about it.  Maybe i just have a high tolerance for chiles.      The decor was pretty interesting as well.  Tons of chotchkies all over the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  There were actually two molinos though.  Cool place, lots of color and stuff to keep your eyes busy.   All in all, great meal, good service, and entertaining environment. I will be back.",

Although not Tex-Mex, I had high hopes for Los Dos because of the rave reviews of my husband's friends and family.  Everyone was promising me this would be a break from the disappointing Mexican food I had tried in the valley.  So, off we go...and what a let down.  The food was okay, but definitely not all it was hyped up to be.  I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues...",

Both the red and green salsas were really salty, all four commented on that. I thought it may be the chips, it was the salsa. Usually, out of town guests comment on the heat, but the salt was the noticeable flavor. Wife had a chicken burrito. Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water. Not to be confused with juice, it was water. My green chili dinner was mediocre. The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat. The meat had been put on the plate, green chili poured over the top. The meat was dry. nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations. Diner three loved the ribs. Diner four ate the flautas, but said they were bland. Typically in Mesa, people love the food and comment on the heat. In this case one loved his ribs, all loved the margaritas. Maybe we hit on a bad night, but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled. These salsas were overwhelming with salt, all four of us commented immediately. We are pretty easy to please, have been eating at Ls Dos for years. We will go back to Mesa, but not this location. There were too many negatives, not much on the plus side.",

Peak time, 8PM Sat. Night.  Wait--15 minutes. Waited in outside patio--folk art, kitsch, object's d'art, totally entertaining enviro. Finally, off to distant dining room. Kinda funky. Walls, windows not exactly immaculate.  Drinks, Chips, Salsa(s).  Chips, so-so. Both green and red salsas--fantastic.  Long wait for entrees, several Bohemias.  Entrees finally arrive.   Good God!   I get the Adovada (red chile sauce), my daughter gets the Green Chile Beef. Both dishes are mind-blowing. Flavors are bright, spicy, yes!, but full of flavor. This food is not for the Chile's crowd. Food is full of personality, the beans with the Adovada are nuts, flavors I can't quite put my finger on, and ridiculously spicy. My daughter's green chile sauce is sensational. None of this taste's like New Mexican food, it's quite something else. Absolutely delicious, assertive as hell, the least bashful food imaginable.  Only complaint....too much food. Brrrppp! Service was quasi-attentive, a little slow, but not annoying. Vibe was great.",

Granted, we probably earned all of our lost calories back but that is the point of working out, right? As long as they cancel each other out, we're good!   They let us bring our pooch on their patio which was a major plus! They immediately brought him water and us chips & delicious fresh salsas (red & green). Their salsa is AMAZING. I wanted to drink it. ;) Next, of course we treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas! They were a little sweet for my liking but i'm a picky margarita drinker. The definitely cured the craving! And of course, we got an order of guacamole for the table to share --- and it was so YUM! You must get it.   For my meal, I ordered the taco & cheese enchilada combo plate with a side of sour cream. Their sour cream is magical! It has secret spices in it that almost taste like ranch! (won my heart right there!). Overall, I was SUPER satisfied with this meal and went home ready for a nap! I'm sure we'll be back after another great hike at South Mountain!",

I'm going to be honest the shrimp did not smell that fresh and I was a little apprehensive about eating it. After eating it, definitely got the sensation it was not fresh and didn't finish it (thank god). We also had their dessert puff bread with honey. That tasted alright but was a tad too oily. I think the worst part was after the meal I didn't feel good at all. Not so much food poisoning but the food didn't sit well with me for the rest of the day.

We said sorry we were lost in the moment give us 2 minutes, it was literally less than 2 minutes, he came back asked if we were ready...I said I'm a GM of a restaurant and am so sorry, but we promise we will order by 830 and make it to go. We did, it came up at 837 with plenty of time to spare, only to over hear them say they wanted to close up and get the last 2 tables out. Done with this location, and wont recommend to out of towners who visit my Scottsdale store and ask for authentic Mexican cuisine. Seriously SO RUDE!

Great ambiance on the patio. 5 stars for this visit when it was averaging 3.5 stars in the past, so 4 stars for now.  UPDATE: after another amazing visit, I have to bump them to a full 5 stars. I got the beef flautas again with pinto beans... I will continue to get it over and over again. My husband got the adovada chimichanga, Christmas style.

    "text": "The Two Grinders. That's what Los Dos Molinos means. The history of how Los Dos Molinos got its name started with a chef named Victoria and her husband , Eddie and these two chili grinders that once belonged to Eddies great grandmother and Victoria's grandmother. Victoria is the main chef here at Los Dos Molinos.  I love a restaurant that has a story like that. Not just history, but an actual story of its beginnings. I had not paid attention to that 'history' on my other visits here. Tonight, I did. Many of the recipes here are incorporated from those same beginnings of those chili grinders some from St. John's and some from New Mexico. If you have ever been to New Mexico, you can identify with how the chilies there are; green and red ... but, often hot. But not just hot, but hot with a lot of flavor.  Los Dos Molinos uses New Mexico chilies and as it states in the history , they don't know how to do mild! That type of sauce doesn't exist here. Don't ask. The food here is some of the best, authentic, flavorful and YES!, caliente!! I have had outside of New Mexico where I landed and built a home after a couple of years in Paris. I now crave those chilies! The specialties are on the front page and have some amazing dishes and many start with slow roasted pork. Tonight my husband and I sat on the eclectic, colorful patio and started with margaritas. Mine : The Villa Rosa , a face sized margarita, frozen with a swirl of raspberry liquor. His: The Sangrita: a margarita with red sangria. Both are big.. both  amazing & perfect for the caliente about to hit our lips. Next we had the Guacamole .. this comes with house made tortillas and is very good , and also a way to cool your meal down. You also get a first basket of house tortilla chips and the red hot salsa that you can truly see the chili flakes in... and a milder , yet, NOT mild, green sauce. Additional chips are a buck more. My meal was a couple of my favorite al la carte items : Cheese enchiladas , they are not truly rolled and they are thicker than what you're likely used to. The Blue Corn Tamale is perfect. I coupled this with the beans , not refried, but True charro type beans. The sour cream here at Los Dos Molinos is different too; it almost has a ranch taste, but again, it's good. My husband had the Carne Adovado Enchiladas. The meat was truly so tender , like melt in your mouth tender. The soft fried egg atop the enchiladas finishes this dish nicely. We left here very full and maybe having the best Mexican meal I've had in Phoenix. It def has given a couple of my other favorites solid competition. Isn't that a great thing about living in the Southwest though ?! The staff here is friendly, ready to assist in any ordering questions and they never let your drinks run dry .. AND, the food is made to order and you can tell in its taste. The Happy Hour is something I will have to return to. $4 drink specials .. Por favor, Si Senor. The only thing that gets me just a little and I would take half a star off , is that Los Dos Molinos seems to make up its own hours! Well, I guess they can! I've tried to take guests from out of town here and find it closed. I've called and the phone has just rung to see if it's open. Now I just ask when I am there : ' Are you going to be open next week ... next month ? Are you going to keep consistent hours?' It's a family run business and I respect the need for time off. It can't be easy being this good:)",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour and dinner this evening. Nice happy hour with $4 margaritas   and $5 mexican pizzas (recommended). There were just a few other people here this early, so the kitchen staff was super fast. As others have stated, most of the food is spicy hot but the green chili is less hot than the red, and there are items on their menu which  are not hot. Their guacamole is delicious, with a unique garlicky note. If your mouth gets hot from the spices, then order a Sombrero drink ( two shots milk, one shot coffee liqueur) to cool it off. Another option is to order their outstanding sopapillas with honey, which will also sooth your mouth.    The chicken chimichanga was a generous size and very good. The green corn tamale was a little small and just average flavor.    It is nice to sit out on their colorful patio which feels secluded and has lively music playing. We will certainly return to this delicious restaurant.",

I have only had one thing from there because it's not spicy, and that's the grande burrito.  The burrito is delicious, but everything else I've tried there has set my mouth on fire and I've had to hand it off to someone else.  For being one of the few sit down restaurants in Laveen, it's one of the better choices.  The service isn't all that great, and we never know who our server is (it's usually 4-5 different people dropping stuff off or taking orders throughout one meal) and we have to ask for things a lot, but all in all, it's a place I've been a repeat customer at",

It was refreshing to eat in a 'free standing' location and not part of a strip mall. As we went to enter, the ladies in front of us stopped because they were doing a birthday celebration for one of the tables - if you want to embarrass the birthday person - Take them here! They do a ceremony where all the employees sing and they create a fire with sugar in a bowl. There was a wait, but it was short. I had the 'Los Dos\" Flautas Dinner with one chicken and one shredded beef.  I thought the flautas were great. Dave had the Carnitas, and I did have a little taste and they were good too! I was also very pleased the service, very attentive and helpful. Why only four stars? They overcharged us for a flour tortilla, and once again I wish the rice and beans were better.   Overall - great food with a great experience. The table next to us was eating the ribs and chili - we are definitely going back to try those!",

We were seated very promptly, ordered drinks and our meals. That's when things went bad. Our Waiter completely disappeared on us leaving us with empty drinks. When the food came, one of our party had no food which took an additional 30 minutes to correct. I will say that, as always the food was exceptional. However the service was awful for the first time since I have dining there over a 12 year period. I hope it's a time anomaly.",

That's where it goes downhill from. We were poorly greeted and sat at a table.  The waiter came by and was taking our order and I asked if they had a milder salsa than what was given with the chips when we sat down. He looked at me and said..\" we don't got no mild \"....with a very condescending tone and look. Every thing we asked for we had to ask for 2 or 3 times.  After ordering it took 35 minutes for the food to arrive. We told him the food my wife ordered was too spicy and he laughed and said \" ha...spicy enough?\" The food was very bland on my plate, I got the ground beef Grand Burrito and it was a tortilla and meat.....nothing else. When done we had to ask for the check 2 times and then it took 10 minutes to get it back. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS place to anyone.",

If I have a friend in from out of town and they want a good representation of Mexican food and atmosphere here, this is where we head to. The building is just beautiful, and when you walk in to see the patio area, I don't know anyone that could not fall in love with it's complete randomness that somehow matches perfectly. The statue of liberty, the fountain, the old bicycle.. it's briliant!!  The food is also incredible. I crave the salsa constantly and the sopapillas are a force to be reckoned with. So far I've had the carnitas and the adovada and love it. I like that Los Dos isn't afraid of spice and doesn't wimp out for it's customers. It's authentic Mexican, take it or leave it.  I've had a good time here both with small and large groups though with a large group our orders got all confused as it was hard to hear the orders the server was shouting and they were just set down anywhere. However, it will not stop me from a return.",

Never would I have expected such amazing food from this hidden treasure.  The restaurant: First of all, you wait outside in this crazy-awesome decorated patio, where the bar is opened to you and friends to have drinks while your table is being prepared. It gets pretty busy (and I can see why) so you can expect to enjoy the unique patio for a while. Which, is perfect when you're with a bunch of friends!  The bar: we had one drink: the HUGE pitcher of margaritas. It's about $25 and you get and entire pitcher of margaritas. They are probably some of the best ones I've had here in Phoenix.  The food: is truly amazing. I had the enchilada with a fried egg on top. The size was more than enough and everything about it was perfect!  The service: I really couldn't tell you how quick the service was. I was having such a great time with friends (and the margaritas) that time wasn't even on my mind.   For a great time, awesome food and great margaritas, come here! :)",

    "text": "We decided to try Los Dos Molinos because it was mentioned in Phoenix magazine and it is one of the best outside patio areas on Yelp.   It is in an obscure location-not downtown Central.  The patio is very fun and eclectic.  There are three bikes cemented around a fountain and a human-sized Statue of Liberty, etc.    My husband and I were meeting another couple there.  We asked if we could have a drink while we waited for them and the hostess just said, \"No\".  When we asked where we should wait, she seemed put off by the question.  After a table was cleared for us, she asked, \"So, I guess you don't mind sitting at a dirty table?\"  We then got up and waited while they wiped the table down.  After sitting there for ten minutes, we had to ask for menus.    A younger man served us chips and spilled salsa on my pants, new jacket and Coach purse.  I cleaned myself up with napkins and he came back a couple minutes later and asked if I wanted something to wipe off with???   I was in the food industry for years.  Not that I'm looking for free food, but it would have been a nice gesture to at least offer a dessert on the house.    Speaking of chips and salsa.  The chips are thin and crispy, my favorite.  They are served with a red and green salsa, both very spicy.  I like some heat but it would be nice to have a milder (at least medium) salsa as an alternative.     I ordered a house margarita because the same gentleman said they used all premium ingredients.  The mix was awful.  If you've ever been to Rocky Point, they use the same nasty green stuff.  I guess it's authentic!  My friend was smarter than me and ordered the $12 Skinny margarita, which was much better.  Kind of pricey for such a casual restaurant though.    The food was very good.  My shrimp were cooked perfectly.  The beans were unlike anything I've ever had before-they were more of a chili bean, not the typical refried or black beans Mexican food is usually served with.  My husband rarely eats beans and even he loved these.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  The food came out fast.    I will give it another shot because the food was exceptional.  Hopefully the customer service will be better next time.",

Flavors that you won't find anywhere else West of Gallup.    Yes, it is loud.  Yes, the floors are sticky from clumsy, half-drunk ASU patrons late on a Saturday night.  But the patio is a cool place to drink a pitcher while gazing at the stars and waiting for a table.    The enchilada dinner is stacked like a proper plate should be.  The chorizo and bean appetizer is unusual.  And they even have soapapillas!  And if you think their chili is hot, wait till you get to New Mexico and try some of the real deal from Hatch!  I'd rate Los Dos as medium on a New Mexico scale and blow-your-head-off on either a California or Texas scale.",

I was especially impressed with the rice and beans; multiple flavors popped with every bite!  Highly recommended.",

(My butthole is going to hate me later) The food was good and flavorful but was almost inedible due to the spice. We got the queso which was so spicy and green Chile enchiladas chicken and shredded beef which also had a ton of spiciness. I couldn't finish either dish. It seems like a busy place though and service was great but unless you enjoy spicy foods make sure you order something mild or bland off the menu or just go to another spot.",

    "text": "My first ( but not last ) visit to Los Dos Molinos was damned satisfying. It's a fair drive from where we are in North Phoenix but let me tell you: it is worth the trip. The area has character in abundance, as does the restaurant itself. Housed in an old hacienda, reportedly formerly the property of silent film star Tom Mix, there is spacious yet cozy patio area reached after winding you way from the front door through the dim and equally cozy restaurant. The patio feels like the place to spend most of your time when the weather is milder. Despite the mild annoyance of a few harmless bees investigating our margaritas, it was just a great spot.  We were immediately and pleasantly greeted by the staff and our waiter took the drink orders. We started with a pitcher of the house margarita, served in nicely large glasses, while checking out the menu and deciding what to eat. While deciding we, of course, enjoyed some chips and salsa. The salsa was your typical selection of red and green but definitely several cuts above average. Both had a good amount of fire to them, the red more so, without being overwhelming. For the meal I decided on the chimichanga combo, with chicken and green salsa. The serving was generous and really tasty. More than enough for a big guy like me. Having finished off our pitcher, T and I switched to the Sangria Margarita. These were seriously tasty. Served \"frozen\" they sport a nice, rich red color with hints of orange. Very flavorful.   The service was just great. Our server was fun, informative and just plain happy and pleasant. The young ladies who brought us our meals and more chips and salsa were outgoing and friendly. Overall, just a great experience.   Make it a point to stop in to Los Dos Molinos if you're venturing down Central, maybe to South Mountain. The decor is nicely eclectic and the whole vibe of the space is both intimate, cozy and cool. The patio area is a fine place to hang out with good friends and enjoy some drinks and some really fine Mexican fare. I know I'm going back.",

In that direction there are three doors, and it is not clear, amid various tables and statues and so on, which door to go in.  There are Saltillo tile floors. The rooms seem like they were once part of a house. The men's room is set catty corner. The ladies room is I don't know where. If you find the cluttered Hodge podge relaxing you will look forward to eating in Los Dos Molinos.  The salsa is spicy. The Enchilada is too. The beef in the taco is plentiful, and lush with gravy and the taste of well braised beef. The rice is mild, but the beans are half refried and fully seasoned.  The service was good, perhaps a little uneven. Despite what the menu said, the group   got separate checks. If we had not it would have been no problem the combination plates are $12 each.  If you do not like strongly flavored food, do not go here. His wife, wanted mild salsa. They didn't have it. For those of us that like full flavor, like they serve in Mexico, and the atmosphere of Mexico would do well to dine here.",

    "text": "I have now been to this specific (and original) Los Dos probably 10 times, 4 of which are in the past 3 weeks.   I think they're starting to recognize my wife and I, which is cool by me.      You want spicy?  They've got it - I've had food here so spicy I was sweating within 2 minutes, but you don't need to read my review to learn that.  They've got balance too, and less spicy items clearly indicated as such on the menu.   Los Dos has been featured in numerous publications and won countless awards over the years for their New Mexican style grub as well as for their margaritas and I don't hesitate to say that both are some of the best in the valley.  Plus, if you're a movie history buff (which I admittedly am not), Tom Mix used to live here. Look him up.     Excellent spicy food?  Check Excellent house specials?  Check Excellent margaritas so damn big you can fit your whole face in the glass?  Check Awesome patio with lots of random but cool memorabelia literally everywhere?  Check Awesome staff?   Check  On my third to last visit, I had the house special Adovada Enchilada which is not your run of the mill enchilada -- it's a thick corn masa patty laid flat with all the stuff you would otherwise find inside a typical enchilada.   It was, frankly, one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.   I also had a couple of their Sangritas (a face sized frozen marg mixed with their house sangria) which are refreshing yet deceivingly powerful.  I could have eaten more, and I could have drank more but that wouldn't have been prudent now would it ;)   On my second to last visit, I had the house special Shrimp Veracruz.  Big ol' shrimp in New Mexico red chili and served over rice with beans and a flour tortilla.  Do you like shrimp?   Try this!   SO. GOOD.  And honestly I didn't find it all that spicy which was OK.    Couple of house margs / rocks / salt to go with it.   A great marg doesn't have to be a \"premium\" marg, it just has to be made with fresh ingredients and the right amount of ta-kill-ya.  They prove that with their house marg here.    On this most recent visit (last night), I had the house special Carne Adovada Relleno with rice, beans and a few spare corn tortillas on the side, plus a couple of Negra Modelos on tap.   I recommend their Carne Adovada to anyone.  So incredibly tender and juicy.   And stuffed inside an egg batter wrapped green chile?   YES PLEASE.  It started off nice and spicy, but I got used to it pretty quickly.     Get your butts into this place, and if you do show up when you think they should be open but they aren't, give them a try some other time.  Dinner between 5pm & 7:30 is a pretty safe bet on most days.",

    "text": "Alpo night   Horrific. Don't go...stay away. The list of issues with this restaurant are far too many to go into a whole lot of detail. A rating of 1 star is far too generous more like a -1.  A short wait - no biggie. We were seated at our table with no menus. After 10 minute of trying to flag someone down I got up and had to fetch a few myself and the hostess acted put out that she had to slightly bend over to pick up the menus.   We waited another 20 minutes (if not longer) before I flagged down the busboy to tell him we were ready to order. He agreed to fetch the waiter.  5 minutes later the waiter showed up and I kid you not he was more stoned than Bob Marley.  This guy was blitzed with greasy skin...maybe he was methed out.   This clearly was canned dog food night. I had been here years ago and the food was stellar but now I wouldn't feed this Alpo even to my dogs.   Cheese dip came, the taste was near rancid with a bit of dog flavor. It was nearly cold and lumpy.  I ordered enchiladas which were not the typical enchiladas we are accustomed to, this ok except it looked like a dog patty and the taste was spot on for cold pressed Alpo dog patty. Even my friend sat and laughed in hysteria. It was an attempt to make a corn patty, then meat, and then egg on top of it.   The corn patty was dried, very hard and inedible. The friend who laughed in hysteria to begin with was so disgusted attempting to sample my corn party all he did was spit it out. There was maybe 4 small pieces of meat and this looked like gravy train out of a can. Folks, I'm not kidding! Seriously it was gravy train out of a can.   Fried egg was cooked well, beans and rice ok.   While other tables were offered extra chips we were not and had been there twice is long. Additionally, other tables seated after us were served their food at least 10 minutes before our plates arrived.   We sat for I don't know how long before our check came so we could lay. I mean it was a long time it seemed to me. We were held hostage for nearly 2 hours from the time we walked in until we got to our car. We were a party of two and very low maintenance. As a matter of fact, before being seated we got our own an margaritas from the bar  so our server didn't even lift a finger to serve drinks.   Horrible experience! I'll never go back!",

The flavors were magnificent and the food seemed so much more authentic. The cons? The service staff is below average. They realize they're in a popular place and people will still come. They could make so much more revenue if they just checked on customers after the food arrived. I would have loved a second margarita. This is not the restaurant's fault but my experience was ruined by some loud-mouthed, low-class drunks who raised the roof with their loud outbursts and laughter. Thanks jerks.

    "text": "Los Dos Molinos is a Phoenix legend for a reason!  Yes, the food is notoriously spicy. Yes, the service can be a bit slow on a packed Friday night. And yes, the restaurant is located in South Phoenix, which apparently scares the pants off of some people.  But the food and drinks are top notch. We usually come at lunchtime on Saturday and have never run into a long wait. Service with a smile, and both seating and food service are fast. Los Dos has the best carnitas in town, and the most potent margaritas. If you're lucky enough to go on a day when the green chili stew special is available, don't miss it!   Chef Victoria's amazing tamales are also available for the holidays. Which reminds me it's time to place my order.",

    "text": "Get ready for an experience of a lifetime. Before even trying Los Dos Molinos, I knew my exposure to Mexican cuisine was missing something truly spectacular. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to try Molinos, that I knew my intuition to be correct. This location draws you in even before you order. The decor and layout is unique. Outdoor seating provides private dining in an open space. Indoor decor draws you into Mexican heritage that gets so Americanized at other restaurants.   When it comes time to order you have had your fill of the best tortilla chips and salsa your tongue could ask for. The salsa fills your mouth with multiple flavors of tomato, peppers, onion and a hint of lingering spice. The tortillas are obviously fresh, crisp and compliment the salsa perfectly.  Get ready for flavor in whatever you order. The majority of their dishes favor spice, but the waiter will give some recommendations to those with weaker stomachs. I LOVE their chimichangas with red sauce. The chicken is moist and the deep fried tortilla is flakey and delicious. Serving sizes are enough for two people, but I rarely share. Los Dos Molinos offers a typical Mexican dessert, sopapillas but I'm usually too stuffed to participate.   This has now become the only True Mexican food I will eat. I recommend it to all my friends who visit from other states, or who live here and have a hankering for something truly authentic and full of flavor.",

If you enjoy spicy food, you must try this.  If you don't enjoy spicy food, I still think you should try it (just get the sour cream like I do).  There are some non-spicy items on the menu of course, but they look so much less interesting...  One of their specialties, and my personal favorite, is an enchilada with an egg on top.  I got it hoping the egg would alleviate some of the heat, and it didn't, but it turned out being darn good.  Beware: the spiciness induces a high intake of the house margarita.  During peak lunch hours, the restaurant can get pretty busy.  This means long wait times.  This also means more margaritas.  Service isn't top-shelf, but they do what they need to do.  I've had a hard time getting someone's attention if it's outside the requisite seating/ordering/serving milestones (that's how I learned to order the sour cream immediately...I just can't wait for that).  Finally, the tab can get kinda pricy.  Especially if you had lots of margaritas.  An average entree is about $15, which I feel is high for lunch.  I enjoy going, but I won't do it often... it's just not *quite* worth the bill.",

The consistency over the past fifteen years of being a customer at the central location has never left me disappointed.  We celebrated our small family pre wedding party dinner here.  Victoria was kind enough to pick up the tab when my better half went to pay.  That was something I will never forget.  She made you feel like family.  The younger family members seem to have taken the reigns, and the food, and quality of everything is excellent.   One of my favorite things here is the beans.  I love the that the beans are whole pinto beans and come in a savory broth.  That was how my dad made a pot of beans, and still my favorite way to enjoy them versus mashed and fried as most places do it.  On our most recent visit I got the cheese enchiladas with the fried egg on top, and asked for Christmas which is both red and green enchilada sauce.  It is such a great comfort food dish.  I usually have leftovers and it makes a great breakfast.  I also love the red and the green salsas that come with the chips.  They have a kick and their so good you just cant stop eating them.  So much so that you might fill up and end up taking half your dinner home. Lol.",

There are no words, just a freaking good chimi, combined with their spicy salsas and chips, I left full and happy.    I am looking forward to this weekend to try a different dish, if I can be strong and fight the allure of that crispy green chili smothered demon that consumes my thoughts when I  get hungry.",

    "text": "This little joint in worth seeking out!  Quirky, Yes!  Quality food, Yes!  After a little hiking at South Mountain, we needed a snack so thought some chips and salsa quickly would solve the issue.  WOW, these salsas are hotter than you usually get.  Not complaining, but it should be noted.  Service was fast and friendly and our entrees arrived in no time.  Since we were going to a wedding later, most of our party of 6 ordered from the a la carte menu. Luckily the portions were still large enough to satisfy.  I loved that you could order \"Christmas\" style so I didn't have to choose from the red or green sauces.  Both were really good!  Would certainly seek Los Dos Molinos out again when in town.",

    "text": "It is a little bit of a drive. However, if you have never driven to the top of South Mountain when you are in Arizona, you're missing out! Not that the restaurant is located there. It is however near the entrance to the park and you can catch it on the way in or out.  South Mountain has breathtaking views of the valley and the photo opportunities at sunset are amazing. It gives you a whole new aspect on the Downtown Phoenix Skyline.  Now about the restaurant. This place is quaint and authentic and offers a taste into great Mexican cuisine! The margaritas are large and tasty! Don't miss the Sangria Margarita (Twyla loved it!) The patio is cozy and friends are made easily during dinner conversation here.  The food as a whole is awesome and it is our favorite of three locations to visit. I had the Green Chili Carne Burrito and a Machaca Taco. Both were wonderful. Our server was both funny and accommodating. If you have never ventured to the South side of town, don't be scared, they like to eat just like you and I. So, just because your on the South side of town, does not mean that something bad will happen. Different cultures. That's all. If you don't take a cruise down here you are really missing out. Live a little I say! Viva la Mexico!  #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate #Vinosquared #irishcatv2 #jimsboisset",

Chips and salsa to start off obviously. Food came out pretty quick for a busy and packed Saturday night at 6pm. Someone in he restaurant had a birthday so the staff came out banging pots and pans and the lights went out so they could light up the birthday dessert. It was neat and original.

That's right I said greet us! We stood there contemplating wether we were wearing our invisible suits or they were just that rude. They finally acknowledged our presence and we were sat. 15 minutes later, they came to ask our drink order. They immediately brought those out and then we asked for a minute to look over the menu. They brought our appetizer (guacamole) which I could have made a better one in my car flying on the I10 westbound to LA (Been done). A while back our waiter decides to come back, don't get me wrong he was nice but just way too slow of service. He then took our food order, I ordered cheese enchiladas with green sauce. When that came out it looked really good but in all honesty, they were flavorless and cheese-less! How can they mess up such a good thing? Anyway, I can't say I'll find myself dining there again.",

The overall service was kind of bad it took about ten minutes for drinks to arrive. I only got one refill the whole night. When the food arrived it was really good it had a great flavor. I ordered blue corn enchilada's, that's something I've never had before. Everything was great. Even the bathrooms were clean, and the staff was great.  I f you are craving good authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. If your In a rush I wouldn't recommend this place due to the bad service.

The salsas available with the chips are pretty hot.  Not as flavorful as some other places, but there's plenty of heat to make you want to order a margarita or sangria if you haven't already done so.  I ordered a combo while my friend got some enchiladas.  Good quality and good quantity.  Service was a little unemotional or uninterested, but it was prompt and nothing was missed.  The New Mexico style food is a good change of pace than the regular Sonoran style found at most places.  It's more of a place to go to if you're in the area rather than destination restaurant.",

It was built up quite a bit from people who had been there or heard of it.  I was excited since there are not a lot of awesome restaurants that I am aware of in this area.  Maybe the other locations are better, this one was NOT up to much.  It seems like it's trying to get by on being famous for spicy food (not my thing) and kitschy atmosphere.  We tried going by for lunch and couldn't find the door.  I am still not sure if it was closed or not at noon on a Saturday, but it looked deserted.  We tried again later at dinnertime.  The inside area was PACKED.  It was like a third world airport.  A screaming baby and rude party-girl customers didn't help, but the atmosphere inside was cramped and not ok.    We ended up sitting on the patio which was fun and eclectic, but not the most comfortable.  There were benches and things instead of normal chairs and it was lit strangely.  The atmosphere outside was marred by more obnoxious kids and the guy at the table next to us noisily losing his mind over the service quality and other things.  Great entertainment!  The service quality was pretty marginal.  They seemed really short staffed, and we had to wait forever to place orders and then longer than expected for pretty much everything.  They were crowded, but that should not have been short staffed on a Saturday night!    There are warnings that the food there is SPICY and they are not messing around.  The salsa was painful, the options were between too spicy for me and biological weapons.  I ordered a bean burrito, which was not actually spicy.  I forgot what my date ordered, but it was just ok and not particularly spicy either.  As a vegetarian who is spice-averse, there weren't tons of options.  There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I don't see coming back here.",

I was impressed with Phoenix's abundant Mexican offerings, but none stood out as spectacular (excepting Barrio Cafe, which I don't consider a traditional \"Mexican Restaurant\"). I was advised by nearly everyone I asked to go check out Dos Molinos, so I did, and it was good... fiery good.  And I don't mean that metaphorically - Dos Molinos is the kind of place that doesn't ask you \"how spicy?\" They just bring you your dish, and it's unabashedly spicy, the way it was meant to be, and I can't imagine they could consider doing it any other way.  All of us were spicy veterans - having all ordered the *level 10 spice level* at [insert any ethnic restaurant name here], and we were all sweating. Bullets.   I had the Red Chili Enchilada combo plate, and the enchilada's were fantastic. It was the THICK handmade corn tortillas, combined with the shamelessly spicy red chili sauce on top. All the sides were terrific (the beans had a kick of their own).  Their margarita was also pretty ridiculously large, and tasty.   Dos Molinos is my go-to Mexican joint in Phoenix now.",

Next, don't let them put you into that first table, which is incredibly tiny, especially if you're 7 months pregnant and eating with 3 men!  I'm only 5'2\" but my belly was literally up against the table.  The guys were super squished too... so I had us move as there were plenty of other tables.  In trying to get out of the little booth, I sliced my finger on the staples that hold the fabric backing onto the wood chair back... nice.  They should fix that.  And... that should be the LAST table they sit people at.    Let's move on...  Service was slow but we finally ordered.  I got the chicken chimichanga and a side of guac.  Well, I tried to get a side of guac but they brought us an appetizer of guac (which is more $$ of course).  That might have been ok since there were 4 of us but, it was terrible.  Really?  Yes... 4 hungry people and we didn't make a dent in our appetizer of guacamole.  It was somewhere in between an avocado (which I love) and guacamole (which I love) but somehow was still disappointing.  My chicken chimichanga had good flavor but there wasn't much to it.  The size was ok but it was basically just a deep-fried tortilla that was stuffed with chicken.  Meh... I'm over this place.  Maybe you have to come for the spicy food but I'm restricted on that right now because I'm preggo.  Won't see ya there!",

    "text": "Los Dos Molinos started as a small hole in the wall in Mesa and now has four locations throughout the valley.  (I even visited the NYC location a few times when they were open.)  The Mesa and south Central locations have been my favorites since the early 80's but I decided to give the Camelback location a try on this trip.  This location feels a bit more upscale than the Mesa location though still casual.  They have an awesome patio that is half covered.  All of their sauces of spices have heat so this isn't for anyone who only eats mild Mexican food.  However, it is not gratuitous heat but for flavoring.  I even add a little red and more of the green salsa to any dish I order.  My favorite has always been the smothered chimichanga.  However, trying to watch my waistline, I stick with the chile verde or burrito served enchilada style (smothered with green chile.  I check out new Mexican restaurants in every town.  However, Los Dos is the only restaurant I go to when in Phoenix.",

Our friends told us to try the one on the other side of South Mountain. I took family visiting for the holiday and they were all very happy with the food, service, and ambience. We enjoyed the salsa and chicken enchiladas plater. The pumpkin flan was so amazing we ordered a second one ;).",

My husband ordered the Spicy Shrimp and the shrimp was a very large size. It was so good. The waiter treated us to Flan which is one of my husbands favorite desserts.

The wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine. The decor was fun and festive, far from fancy.  All 7 of us squished into a booth. The service was fair, though they handed us the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did). For some reason this caused our server tons of confusion. The chips and salsa were good. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which was just okay.  My family seemed to really like their meals. The sopapilla was good, just simple. My family liked the flan.  However, the menu had NOTHING vegetarian-- the beans are made with lard and the rice and enchilada sauce has chicken stalk. The tortillas likely had lard too.  I ate chips and salsa for my meal. I was deeply saddened, as I was starving for a cheese enchilada or a bean burrito after a 2 hour hike. In this day and age it baffles me that a restaurant can't put together ONE vegetarian option. Plenty of other authentic Mexican places are able, why not Los Dos? I'll never return :(",

    "text": "I am going to catch some heat (pun intended) on this one as LDM is considered a sacred cow in this town. I just think it is average and I don't like the location and I am not that impressed with the service. Being a native New Mexican, who knows a tremendous amount about Rio Grande - Nuevo Mexican cuisine and even more about New Mexico chiles (Hatch, Dixon, Espaola, Chimayo, Mesilla Valley, Socorro, Pecos Valley, etc), as well as, the heirloom chile's of the Pueblos and truck farms. You name it, I have been eating them for 42 years by the bushel.  I enjoy the pungent flavor of the LDM chile relleno plate that I always have when I've dined there, but I believe the chiles are Mexican. Nothing wrong with Mexican chiles as I love them, BUT I think it is wrong to call the chiles \"New Mexican\" if they are not. I have had New Mexico chiles there in my dish, but I have had others as well. I can discern the difference and would not claim it if I could not definitively state so. It's like saying here is your glass of Burgundy when your serving a Pinot Noir from the Languedoc. Both are French Pinot Noirs, but they definitely don't taste the same. It is a matter of nuance, and one has a higher market value to consumers. I believe it would be logistically impossible for a restaurant like LGM to only feature New Mexico chiles year round in Phoenix. As well as, their sister restaurants in NYC, Mesa, and Springerville, AZ.  The expense of the amount they would need would be astronomical based on the amount of covers they do. It would require the Franzoy's or Lyttle's entire chile crop to satisfy the demand.  Let's face it even if you froze a container of chiles for your restaurant to use, thawed chiles suck compared to savory fresh roasted! My other complaint is owner - mangaer, Cheryl is flat out rude and obnoxious. Friendly and hospitable is the absolute manner in New Mexico (not Santa Fe faux wannabes) cafes and restaurants. She has snapped at me on one occasion and was curt and unresponsive on others. Most New Mexico style restaurateurs would not be taking shopping junkets to Paris and driving canary yellow Corvettes either. You see being wound up on fashion and MAC cosmetics are not typical attributes of New Mexico food...it is simply red or green or \"Christmas\" on fancy occasions. Comida Deluxe is all about the food. The other serious complaint I have is the terrible Margaritas...reading the other Yelpers go on and on about how great they are makes me scratch my head. Cheap mixto Tequila and bad triple sec makes bad Margarita. Period! Sure if my choice is between Arribas or Los Dos it is a no-brainer...do the Dos. However, both thrive on gimmick of fabled New Mexico food. If you want some simple New Mex, go to Si Senor on Alma School. Cheap, fast and friendly.  By the way, I am not attempting to get all Diane Kennedy on you but the food at LDM is not authentic Mexican cuisine! It is Border American at its' best. I am sure that the recipes are traditional to Chef  Victoria's' family and authentic to their culture. The cuisine in New Mexico is not authentic Mexican cuisine either. Neither is Tex-Mex or California Mission examples of AUTHENTIC Mexican. Just like a German National would not recognize a Chicago hot dog as authentic German cuisine even though German immigrants created the Frankfurter. I did not see any Sicilians eating Spagetti and Meatballs last time I was in Vittoria on wine business.",

    "text": "I think that this is probably one of the more authentic Mexican food restaurants that I have been to and if you really want to add extra kick to your meal, try a prickly pear margarita.  Boy - those things will definitely add some intrigue to your night or at the very least some good laughs.   If you go, plan extra time to sit and wait for a table because chances are unless you are very lucky, you will have to wait quite awhile to be seated.  But, I think that it is worth the wait.  Amendment, May 2008 - I have co-workers in town for a trade show.   A few nights ago, I suggested Los Dos for dinner.  I warned them that the service was slow but the food is always good.  We agreed to try it.  We arrived at 7:15ish.  Half of our party wasn't there - so in order to not be rude and take up a table, we ordered some drinks, chips & guacamole and took a table outside to wait.  At around 8, we were still minus 2 guests and starving.  So, I went in and got us a table.  I'd say our other 2 finally showed up around 8:30.  We did not get greeted by a waiter until 9pm - an hour after sitting.  Had he come up to us in the beginning, I would have told him that we were going to just order as a partial party.  But no one even asked.  They sent over a nice guy that could only take our drinks and kept saying that he'd bring us a waiter.  Right before the waiter finally appeared, I walked up the hostess stand and let them know that it really had been far too long to be waiting.  There were 2 girls behind the stand and a busboy (not really sure what his position was considering most of the night he ogled these 2 girls and stood scratching his head at the hostess stand - maybe he was the third hostess?).  They were pretty rude to me and continued to get ruder through out the night.  Unfortunately, I had such a BAD experience that I will no longer be recommending this place to anyone.  I'm rating it a one star - down from 4 stars.  I was embarrassed that my co-workers had to see such a nasty side of my fellow Arizonans.  I will not be returning to Los Dos Molinos.  I have had a lot of poor service here - but I always took the bad with the good because the food is good.  But, they just crossed the line too far this time and I won't support a place that treats me (the customer) badly.  I work in the service industry from time to time at trade shows.  I know that people have their bad days and I know that it can be hard to always meet every customers needs - but I also know that I do my very best to be kind and helpful to every customer no matter what mood I am in and I expect the same in return if I am spending money for a service.",

Get delicious, spicy, enchiladas, machaca, chile rellenos and carne adovada served new mexican style.  The service here is somewhat sketch at times, but the margaritas are tasty and the salsas are delish and put a fire on your tongue that necessitates mas margarita which equals mas divertido.  My favorite thing that they serve, carne adovada tacos, is actually not on the menu at this location (i usually go to the downtown location), but the enchiladas, carne adovada, and salsas are legitima.",

If you only have time to go to one Mexican restaurant in Phoenix this is the one. Only problem (and the reason I only gave it 4 stars) is that they close the place or go on vacation randomly and even if you call to make sure the place is open they do not update their phone message. We have gone there two or three times and found the place closed on a night they normally are open even though their message said they were open. We have also been to the Mesa and Downtown locations and while the food is as good it is not the same experience as going to the Central Ave. location.",

OK for those of you that like hot hot hot I mean burn your face off then later your BUTT! You might enjoy this plethora of torture. Me not so much! My dumb-ass sister drug me and 4 other family members that were visiting from Illinois to this fire pit of hell!  We ordered 2 pitchers of Margarita's that were more like dinking lemonade. Yuck and they were way over priced 30.00 each Kick - ass pitcher my ass.   I asked our server \"how hot is the green chili\"? His response to me was \"it's mild\". I then proceeded to order the Machaca chimichanga with green chili sauce. I love a good Machaca Chimi.   We waited for our meal sipping the lemonade AKA Margarita, munching very salty chips. Mine without salsa because one bite of that left the tip of my tongue stinging!  The food arrived it was a huge portion; I thought there is a go box in my future. I took the first bite, more dough than anything as usual with a Chimi. The second bite brought my temperature up about 10 degrees. I continued thinking I must have gotten a seed or chunk of pepper. The third bite woohoo 3 alarm fire in my mouth! After sucking back an entire glass of water and several tortilla chips. I decided it was the green Chile sauce on top and began pushing it off and away from my Chimi. I go in for the middle of the Chimi where the Machaca is and no sauce. Hells bells are you kidding me that bite was the hottest of them all like I had found the scotch bonnet surprise!!!!!!!!!   I surrender! I cannot continue with the taste bud massacre. I think I am scarred for life. At this point my lips are burning, I am sweating, and I am devouring a bowl of chips trying to put out the inferno raging inside my mouth. My poor cousins are experiencing the same type of hell. All except for my cousin Jenny who has no tolerance for heat and got the most expensive cheese crisp in Phoenix 6.95. Its cheese and a tortilla people!   I stopped the server and said there is no possible way I can eat this it is entirely too hot. Is there anything on the menu other than the cheese crisp that is not hot? He brought me the menu; I found a garlic shrimp dish and ok sounds good for 13.95 I got 5 very large shrimp covered in melted cheese. They tasted like the following recipe place 5 large shrimp in a small casserole dish sprinkle with as little garlic powder as possible, add a hand full of cheese then put in the microwave until cheese melts. It was awful gag gag gag; it had no flavor at all I could even taste cheese.   Ok I will wrap this up as I now am rambling away. I am not a spice whimp I love Wasabi and lots of it, but this kind of hot is not for the average person who likes hot. I cannot tell you if the spicy dish was good because the heat ruined it for me and my family. My sister is the only one who liked it.   I will not be back, not worth the drive, the time, the money or the recovery!",

    "text": "After months of avoiding Los Dos Molinos in favor of places with better service and margaritas, we decided to return last Saturday night and give the place another chance. We were actually even less impressed with the experience than last time.   My blue corn enchiladas were still quite good, but my husband's chimichanga was just average. I guarantee you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at many of the other great Mexican restaurants in South Phoenix. The accompanying rice was also really dry; I think the rice at Poncho's is a lot better.   I also gave the tequila-flavored limeade--I mean, margaritas--another chance, but was still completely disgusted by them. The most amusing part is that after I told the server that I found them to be too limey and sweet last time, he admitted that they mix the margaritas up in advance and that if the server doesn't properly \"stir\" the mix, they can be \"too sweet.\" He then promised me that it would be \"better this time.\" I guess I'm a sucker for ordering one anyway (I guess I had this morbid desire to see if it was really going to be as bad as last time), but shame on Los Dos Molinos for approaching margarita-making like they're serving drinks at a college party.   Finally, the service is totally pretentious for no reason. I understand that this restaurant is very popular, but I don't feel that the owners take much pride in putting out consistently good-quality food and drinks or in being a place where people feel comfortable and want to linger with friends.   Los Dos Molinos must always be so busy because people are lured by the exotic spiciness (and maybe Falsely equate spiciness with authenticity), but I have a feeling that discerning restaurant-goers who notice (and care about) the details might not be in love with the place.",

Yes the Salsa is spicy but really has no taste to it.  it's like Spicy water.  Everybody in our party of 7 did not even eat a quarter of their meal.  The Machaca that i had must have been Marinated, Aged and Cooked in Salt using a Rock Salt Oven and to make matters worse the servers were no where to be found to refill our refreshments as our mouth dried like Cured Hides.  This place should have been called Los \"Sal\" Molinos and should have stayed a Funeral Home and use the large amount of Salt they use for Embalmment.  Currently competing with Morton for the #1 spot as Salt distributor in the South West Region.",

It's kind of like the first time you had sex  -- it may not have been that pleasant of an experience, but you'll never forget it.   Los Dos Molinos is a spicy food lovers dream. If you like to sweat while you eat and like to eat jalapenos like they're M&Ms, then by all means get yourself to Los Dos. The food is THAT spicy, but it isn't too overpowering, that is, if you pick the right entree. I've had their red cheese enchiladas, and they ARE muy caliente. And, you think the beans will cool off your tongue? Nope, those are laced with jalapenos as well. The only way to truly cool off the explosion of spice in your mouth is with a nice, cold, frozen or on the rocks Margarita.  Overall, I enjoy Los Dos for what it is -- an adventure for my taste buds. I have to say, though, it isn't a place I could go to on a regular basis; I don't think my stomach could handle it. But, it is a fun place to take those out-of-town guests who've never experienced real Southwestern food. They'll leave with either a smile or a scowl. But whichever way, they'll never forget it!",

    "text": "I title this \"5-stars, even though I have thrown up my dinner while still at the restaurant twice\".  It is the experience.  I think of it as Mexi-Disneyland for adults and realize that this construct is based primarily on the excessive use of seafoam green paint and the beer shack where you can get drinks while you wait for a table.  The reasons:  I've been there many more than two times, I probably had too many coronitas while I was waiting, too much of my margarita, and too much hot salsa, and I ordered the shrimp both times -- I never really eat shrimp (but how many times can a girl eat a chile relleno when the buttery garlicness looks so so good)... but those are just hypothetical reasons that may explain the throwing up.  The reasons I like it:  My bff (best food friend) is \"famous\" there.  She can call and order a particular dish 24 hours in advance and it goes on the menu as the \"Angela\" special.  I think the story goes that she was the only person to order it the first time it was offered and she loved it and Cheryl (or Sheryl... I don't know how she spells it) loved her.  I've heard the food is a little better if you go with my bff than if you go without her.... but why would I ever go without her?  She's my best food friend and she's famous there!  There aren't a lot of vegetarian options...in fact, my bff recently told me she thinks there might be beef stock in the salsa... which leads me back to the beginning and my hypotheses about why I've thrown up in their restroom twice now.  I think we're going back next week.... so I'll write with an update....",

And yes, I love spicy Mexican food.  I grew up in a border town for Christo's sake.  This IS NOT Mexican food.  Its a gimmick.  Genuine Mexican food is supposed to be subtle in heat and grow throughout the dish.  One should be able to taste the layered spices and complex ingredients.  Mexican food takes a lot of effort and time to make and should be complimented by a thorough savoriness by the consumer.    Their food must suck, but you'd never know it because it is so fully disguised by the Dos Molinos people, who drop a nuclear bomb on your head and ask you if you want to order another Dos XX.  My only compliment is the patio and the fact that they serve Mexican beer, which we all know is the cure for radioactive exposure.",

I can't really comment on crowds (as some reviewers have done) since we were there at a slow time of day.    Service was attentive.  We ordered beer and enjoyed the chips & (hot!) salsa.  And then we got our food.  I think I went through several beers during the meal-- bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  Bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  And so on.  But the (HOT!) food was so good (as was the beer) that I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole (HOT!) meal.  I'm not always a spicy-food guy, but I loved it.  My face was sweating, the food was so spicy!  My partner was laughing at me about it; it was all good.  So, to sum up:  It was really, really tasty.  Hot and tasty.

My family has been going for years and years so I my perspective on the service is skewed, i love the sassy servers I see every time I go.  But even I know, if you show up less than a half hour before closing, they will give a loud exasperated sigh, look at their watch, then up at the clock, then back and you, and then possibly seat you. Maybe.  But there is a special place in my heart & stomach for Los Dos and this is by far my favorite location. It's a fun place to go with a group because no one cares how loud or tipsy you get and it's semi-amusing to see your friends get shot down when they ask for mild sauce.. just fyi. they don't do that. They \"don't know HOW\" to make mild sauce.",

If you like it hot (the food) and you aren't going out to eat to be dazzled by the establishment then give it a shot, but go with the right expectations or just don't bother because it clearly isn't for everyone.",

    "text": "I used to eat at Los Dos Molinos regularly for almost ten years. But lately I've gotten fed up and I no longer go. There are far better Mexican restaurants in the Valley. \r \r I think the success of this restaurant has led to arrogance on their part. I noticed a few incidents of rude behavior during my last few visits, which is what prompted me to stop going. One day I showed up with 4 friends (mixed crowd of well-dressed males and females, some lawyers and an engineer) on a very hot day around 5 pm. When I made the mistake of admitting that there were 5 in my party, the host told us he wouldn't seat us until the 5th arrived EVEN THOUGH there were empty tables. Then he told us to wait outside rather than in the restaurant. It was over 100 degrees outside so I asked him if we could be seated given that it was so hot, and he said it was their \"policy\" to wait until the full party arrived. I glared at him and said in a civil tone: \"That's not a very nice way to treat your guests.\" He just looked at me and shrugged his shoulders. \r \r That's how they rewarded almost ten years of my loyalty as a customer. \r \r A friend of mine who has kids was also turned off by a sign in the restaurant that says, \"Please control your kids\". I don't have kids and I agree that parents should control their kids, but it's the \"we don't really care if we seem rude to you\" attitude that I choose not to deal with anymore.\r \r By the way I read another review suggesting you call ahead to make reservations due to wait times. It's the \"policy\" of Los Dos Molinos not to take reservations over the phone. You have to show up and wait. Wait times on Friday and Saturday can be 1-2 hours at the South Phoenix location. On weekend nights they open up a second part of their patio where you can have beer, and chips and salsa for a charge. But it's cash only and there are no ATMs.\r \r I've never had any attitude problems at the Mesa restaurant, but the Mesa one has a lot less character than South Phoenix. I've also been to the one in Springerville (northern Arizona) and it was great.",

The building is kind of a hole in the wall place which adds to the experience. Apparently it used to be a barn or stable... but they did a great job decorating. I don't come here for great service so I don't mind the lack of service. My food has always come quick and my glass stays full of my favorite beverage so I'm a happy camper.  If you are visiting town for one night and want an experience, Los Dos Molinos is a great one!",

    "text": "On a recent whim the best friend and I decided to venture out from our familiar Tempe surroundings and head into Phoenix for some dinner. While I had heard of the Los Dos before I have never taken the time to get here until one fateful November night.  We arrived and parked up close to the door which I thought was to indicate we would have no wait, how I was mistaken! There was no obvious signs from the outside that the seating inside was so small. We put in our name and waited on the outside patio where we had some chips and salsa to wait for our names. 45 minutes later, a bowl of chips and two frosty AZ dwellers were seated inside near the kitchen entrance. Hooray!  Noted was the decor of crazy New Mexico style. An employee took our drink and appetizer order quickly and our chips/salsa and guacamole came out quickly. Besides finding pieces of the core in our guac we were beginning to be satisfied. Another different employee came to take our food order which we were ready to provide. Things were looking up until the lights went off...  Apparently the tradition here at Los Dos is to turn the lights out for a birthday customer and bring them out a flaming Hispanic dish. The problem with this was that the lights were out for about 8 minutes before anyone produced said item. So there we sat, in the dark with no clue as to what was going on. Bells clanging, people clapping and fire spouting came the traditional celebratory food. Good we thought, we can carry on now.  Then things got ugly. Well, we got our dinners first, and then we notice a slight commotion in the corner table. What I originally thought was an older disabled man who needed help getting up after his dinner was actually a heavily intoxicated older man who had *ahem* thrown up his two margaritas and his dinner onto himself and the floor. From what my companion tells me the margaritas are particularly strong here at Los Dos and so we were present to witness this older man basically incapacitated from two Margs. Paramedics are called. Hoopla commences.  We decided to bite the bullet and finish our meal and try to make the best of things. The food it turns out is very good. Tamales, tacos and chimichangas were ordered and enjoyed. Very flavorful and well made, definitely enjoyed the green sauce here. Not too hot and not too weak, just right.  Unfortunately this brings the final flaw in our night of dining. After our dinners were brought out to us, we sat, and sat and sat some more with no employees even looking at us for nearly 35 minutes. No queries for drinks, more chips, dessert, nada. I finally went up to the register and the lady handed me my check. I asked if this was the normal practice because I had never been to the restaurant before and had sat waiting for additional help/check/anything. She nodded and apologized to then blame the craziness that had gone on. While I understood, there had been only two employees helping the elderly gentleman who tossed up his dinner and neither were the ones that had helped us thus far.   Nevertheless I paid our tab and we made our way out. Full and satisfied from food but disappointed in the experience overall. Whether Los Dos will get another shot is still undecided, perhaps another location at the least.",

No obviously wrong since we asked for her awhile ago.   Again food was awesome service not.  As I left in the parking lot a couple mentioned service was awful they were going somewhere else.  Ok here's the odd thing I've eaten there many times. When they were busy and had fewer people working and had BETTER service.  The bus people were more attentive than the servers on this visit.

My descriptions will not do this place justice. There is an outdoor patio area with all kinds of wall art, a fountain, 6-7 tables. We sat out there. Our server mentioned that they are known for their pork dishes, so this is what I tried. The pork was wonderful. I was very concerned about getting something too spicy, but our server just said to stay away from any thing labeled with chiles and I'd be fine. The portions were perfect. They serve margaritas by the pitcher. Los Dos is a must go if you're in Phoenix.",

I started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila. Not here, wow it had quite the punch to it. I'm excited to find a place that can make a great margarita without skimping on the liquor.   Yes, the salsa is hot and yes, you're going to hate it if you don't like spicy food. But, that's just the way it's gonna be. They bought two different varieties, a green and a red. I preferred the flavor of the green.   My favorite thing to order in a Mexican restaurant are taco salads. The only thing that I found a little disappointing was they didn't have any dressing for the salad. I prefer a little Italian dressing with mine, this is the first place I've been to that didn't have any dressing options. The salad was good, but not great.   The service was awesome.

The chips were fresh and crispy, but not greasy and the salsa is flavorful but be warned that when they say it is hot, it certainly is. New Mexican heat is completely different from Mexican heat so it will spring up on you. I had The Fresh margarita which is a blended margarita with Raspberry liquor and it was refreshing. My husband had a Fruta prickly pear margarita on the rocks and he was extremely pleased with it. For lunch I enjoyed the shredded beef flautas which come with guacamole and an herbed sour cream. Gosh they were good. Our littles shared a bean and cheese burrito that was a hit and my husband had the 2 blue corn enchiladas with rice, beans and added a red chili beef tamale. Everything was flavorful and not a bite was spared. We will definitely be returning again and again. This location was also fun and had a very authentic vibe.",

Service was very fast too, especially for a Saturday night!  We had the Carne Adovada Chimichanga and the Victoria's Chicken Chile plate (green chile) with the Spicy Beans (not on the menu), and a side of sour cream.  Everything was delicious.  The green chile sauce was very spicy, but had a great taste.  Not just spicy to say it is spicy.  Truly delicious!  Both the chicken and the pork were juicy and cooked to perfection.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sour cream was a perfect touch to help manage the heat levels.  Topped dinner off with a pitcher of the fresh margaritas and 1800 tequila...  Perfect compliment.  Can't wait to come back to this place on our next trip!!!",

I tend to prefer the reds, but the green wasn't a tomatillo salsa, instead it was more of a green chili salsa (delicious and spicy).  I ordered the number 2 combo, which came with a beef taco and a red chili tamale. The flavors of the meats were excellent and the red sauce they used on the tamale was perfect.  The service was very slow, as it seemed there was only one server doing most of the work.   The prices were reasonable, most being in the $10-15 range.",

Another party came by and they ordered drinks and food right away once they sat down AND got their food way before we did. I understand that in the menu, it states that there will be a little wait since it's just the cook and an assistant but damn, we waited over an hour to just get our food. And they got better service once they sat down than we did. I ordered the carnitas and my mom and Brother got the chimichanga. Let me tell you about my carnitas. Or should I say, Manteca (fat). Where's the meat? It was hiding. I literally had to dig inside the fat and cheese  to find it! The beans, were ok. Just boiled regular pinto beans with no salt and added cheese. The rice was actually ok but I was so disgusted to eat anything. My brother and mom liked the chimichanga but skipped the rice and beans. In the meantime that I was trying to find my carnitas in the Manteca, no one. But I mean NO ONE checked on us to see if we needed anything else or to see how the food was. The waiter didn't even ask if my food was ok since I left the whole plate when we asked for the check. He just bypassed it like it was normal. What a disappointment. I'm sorry but I will NEVER return and will not recommend to anyone!",

Hot food and brusque service is their calling card. The Victoria's chicken chili is good enough that I would come here and eat it even if they peppered me with insults the whole time(which they wouldn't, I'm just saying).  Posole is good, but even better at the location on Chandler Blvd. if you like hot stuff, put on your big girl panties and give this a whirl.",

Fry bread or sopapilla would be better than a crisp white-flour tortilla called \"Mexican pizza.\"  Lovely people, fun setting, good sangria, forgettable food.",

Honestly, I could have just gone home and passed out from fatigue.  Well actually, I did...I had left my phone at home the entire day, and decided to go get it in case I missed any calls.  Two phone calls and two text messages later, I woke up and made the short trek over (I had been promising them I'd go for several months now, and damn it, I was going to come through this time)!  I ordered the adovada ribs, which were pretty good and spicy, but also kinda salty.  Despite that, hunger took over and I wolfed a good portion of it down before packing the rest up in a to go box (in fact, it was just a styrofoam plate with a piece of foil).  The chips and red and green salsas were also pretty delicious and fiery.  I'm looking forward to my next trip out to Los Dos Molinos!",

While the location can scare off some, I have never had a problem and it has always been worth it.  I must say, Los Dos is not for the wary as you will experience VERY spicy food, be overwhelmed by ceiling decorations and bright colors, and possibly deal with a wait.  Their motto is \"Some like it hot\" and its no joke; if you don't mind sweating and sniffling then this is the place to go!  I consider myself quite the critic when it comes to Mexican food, and I have to say, the rice and beans are excellent, great flavors, homemade tortillas, hot salsas, a great chile relleno, and good service.  If I were to nitpick, my complaints would be the sangria and seat comfortability.  All in all, this is authentic Mexican and a great local favorite.",

I grew up near Mexico and even lived there for a short while, so I have a pretty discerning taste for Mexican food.   Mexican food does not only equal spicy. Sure, spicy flavors are a common part of Mexican foods, but there are so many other delicious flavors involved. I felt that if Los Dos took out the \"heat\", there'd be nothing but bland food remaining. I can handle spice, but give me some flavor in my food!   Also, the margaritas were not very good. They tasted like they were straight from a really cheap margarita mix.   Yes, we did have good laugh over several of the people at our table who broke a sweat while they were eating, but would I call the food and flavors delicious? Definitely not. The restaurant has a festive decor and is perhaps a good place to take out-of-towners to laugh at them while they eat spicy food, but if you're looking for  flavorful Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend Los Dos.",

I always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when I get the most expensive response, today I didn't! I was recommended to the Chicken Enchilada plate. I am normally not an enchilada type of guy, not enough substance for me and usually too much tortilla. However these proved me wrong.  The enchiladas were piled high with moist shredded chicken and covered in Green Chile(not for the faint if heart). Then it was all brought together by melted cheese which was crisped to perfection. Another great experience at Los Dos however if this is your first time there is a reason why each table gets its own pitcher of water!",

They also have dietcoke.  Can't say there is anything I would particularly recommend.  I think I had a green or blue corn tamale that was outstanding.  I love the salsa it's unique. Not just red salsa.  My complaint is that I feel like they dont care about the food.  It's not really consistent.  There is little care to quality. The people that work there always seem like they are suffering being at work.  Not to say that the service is bad.  I have had much worse food.  I have been there a dozen times.  I have also had much better food in Arizona.  So 3 stars reflects that fact that it's average. if you love mexican food like me. Then you should try los dos molinos.",

We got there early on a Saturday(5:30)- which was good because the place filled up fast. That was the only thing that happened fast there.   We only got one menu that four of us had to share and after about 20 minutes had our drink orders taken. I had a sangria, which was ok, but tasted mostly like grape kool-aid. We got chips and salsa-which was depleted in 5 minutes between four of us. We asked for more and got it only after we asked again.    Three of us got the chicken enchiladas and we all agreed that they were ok, not quite good, and far from great. JD had the special- a chorizo pizza. It was really salty and greasy but the crust was kind of crispy, surprisingly. We got another round of drinks and ordered sopapillas to go. This took forever! I didn't eat mine, but heard that they were worth the wait later. I seriously doubt it. Not planning a return trip here.",

Unlike PB (which represents a wildly successful marketing coup), Los Dos is a wonderful little oasis in the armpit of South Phoenix. My SO and I have been going for an embarrassing number of years (and, accordingly, the staff is super welcoming and we rarely wait). He occasionally demands a birthday dinner there, Los Dos style -- they turn the lights off, bang pots and pans, scream their heads off, and bring a festive dessert.  Yes, the food is hot. Do you not know this when you go? I mean, you don't drive by this place on your way to the mall and think 'gee, we should try that sometime'. You are going to be in pain at both ends, my friends, but it's delicious. Even their sour cream is special, tweaked by the addition of subtle flavors of mysterious spices.  The margaritas may have grown weaker over the years, or perhaps my liver has just ramped up to keep pace. I've gotten falling down sloppy shitfaced here many a time.   The haters are just pissed off that the staff served their bratty attitudes right back to them instead of kissing their plump asses as they are so accustomed to and/or they are transferring their embarrassment about being pussies about the hot food. Tough titty. More for us!",

The service, on the other hand, is a little more... complex.  One time when we were waiting for a table, when the guy called my name he called, \"Last chance for Mark D\". Last chance? So we jumped up and ran inside just before he gave our table away to someone else. I said WTF? He said, I called your name three times (He did so NOT call my name three times - we were sitting right in front of the door the entire time - there's no way). So I told him that. And we argued about it, went back and forth like.. did TOO, did NOT, did TOO, did NOT), until I spotted the other guy - the nice guy - standing behind him shaking his head (they've kind of got this good cop / bad cop thing going over there), and the nice guy was just shaking his head, as if to say, \"Ah, don't worry about him, he's just in a bad mood.\" So we didn't, we sat down, ate some fabulous food, downed some rocking 'ritas and had a great time as always.   Here's the thing I want you to take away from that story: Even though it does seem like there's always at least one employee \"in a bad mood\", and the service may not be exactly friendly, it is attentive. I've never had to wait very long for anything, or not gotten what I wanted, I just maybe didn't get it with a smile. And for me, for this place, that's fine. That's just the way it is there. I think it helps knowing that going in. In my opinion, the food and atmosphere more than make up for it. Hell, I keep going back and back and back and back...",

    "text": "Unfortunately not a great place for service! We went with a group of friends and chose this place because of the Phoenix magazine review...disappointed to say the least. The food was pretty good. I had a chicken burrito and the guacamole was amazing! But the owner was extremely rude! They wouldn't seat or even take a soda order for my friends before we got there. When there was two tables open on the patio the the waiter asked us to choose one, when I sat down the \"owner\" walked by and asked if I would like to sit at a dirty table (well...not really) in an extremely rude demeaning tone. That was the FIRST of many unfortunate happening at this restaurant specifically with the lady owner.  Our waiter, a younger guy that said she was family was actually very nice and apologetic that she was not a happy person...obviously we could tell that by the way we were treated. Will not make the drive back...",

Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time.",

Salsa and chips are always good and HOT. We love the chorizo dip. Adovada ribs aren't the best, they really should try to get better meat.  The marq's are tasty but a little overpriced. All that said it is a favorite of guests from out of town due to its charm and hot food.",

    "text": "The service here is always horrible; the staff moves incredibly slow.  Four of us came in for lunch at about 1pm on a Saturday and left well after 2:30 pm.  It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive and then another half an hour to flag someone to receive our check, then wait 15 minutes further to get change and the receipt.  They also charge a dollar each time we had our chip bowl refilled (which we were not aware of until the bill arrived) and they also charge 0.75 for refills on iced tea and soda (which I was aware of b/c it was clearly stated in the menu.)  You should ask when you order a specific beer whether they offer it on tap, because they will not ask you on their own which you prefer, and automatically bring out a bottle which is more expensive.  The food has flavor, and their salsa is spicy.  They make homemade tortillas but unfortunately mine was burnt and dried out.  Their margaritas are delicious and the decor festive.  I don't think the prices are worth the wait or the portion sizes though.",

The chips and salsa are good, and of course the salsa is HOT. The dish I love is the chicken enchiladas with a cooked egg on top. Not as good as Mi Nidito in Tucson, but still pretty darn good and worth the trip.",

    "text": "I have never received worse service in my life. My two friends and I came around 7 pm. We were not greeted for 10 minutes. When we were greeted we were brought the wrong drinks. We then did not see any server for ten minutes to get the right drinks. When we made our food order I asked for a mild version of the enchiladas due to a stomach issue and the waiter said that could be done. The food did come out in good time but when I got my enchilada it was terribly spicy and overall inedible. 20 minutes later.... when we saw our waitress again I asked her if I could order something else because it was far too spicy and not what I  ordered. She said \"its new mexico style- we don't offer a mild version\" I told her the waiter should have informed me that when he told me they could make it mild. We were met with a huge eye roll and a firm reach to take my plate. At that time I order chicken floutas instead since nothing else could be made mild. My friend ordered a refill on her drink, something we had not been given all night... it was not busy at all on a Tuesday night! By the time my new plate came out 30 minutes later my friend still had not received her refill. She walked up to the girl who took my order and said Hi do you think I could get my refill on my coke that I ordered and the girl eye rolled again and said \"well you didn't order it from me\". She brought her a coke and then the check immediately before I even finished eating.  They came back and asked for our payment three times will picking up one thing off the table at a time. More than we had seen them all night! Worst service I have ever had. Terrible wait staff with no customer service experience. The food was decent but the staff needs some training.",

Bad sign -- we're not from the area and we couldn't get back until after the coupon expired. Management offered to extend it for us, however. which was great because we were then able to try this really good Mexican food.   We both had the Los Dos Flautas special, which consisted of two very large and filling flautas filled with shredded beef or chicken. The beef was absolutely delicious -- just mouth watering, juicy and not too spicy. This restaurant is famous for it's hot, spicy foods so we were happy to find an entre that did not have too much zip. The flautas had a great guac and some very fresh sour cream, along with rather average rice but really excellent beans.   I only wish this restaurant would have a low-powered gringo version of their salsa. Neither one of us could dip their excellent chips into the offered sauce. Too hot by far!",

Waiting with perfect margaritas was great--but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale.  There's red-hot red and fiery tomatillo, and the gringo in our group couldn't enjoy chips n salsa at all.  Maybe there's a third option they don't tell you about?  I dunno.  The red salsa tasted like the red peppers you sprinkle on pizza, blended with oil in a Cuisinart.  Not my favoritestyle--I prefer a touch more of the tomato.  My carnitas were pretty bland, frankly, but everything else our table ordered was pretty solid.  Chimis and enchiladas with flavorful, nasty-hot green and red sauces.  This is one place where I'd actually order a hamburger on the side for your out of town guests, just in case they can't stand the heat.  A Phoenix legend that everyone should try for themselves.  I got unlucky this time with my order--ten years ago I remember loving whatever I had.",

We came in and were seated immediately but after 10 minutes or so had not received a menu even though someone had already come by to take our drink orders. We managed to find a few menus on another table and then put in our order. The food was great. My wife normally doesn't like Pork but she ordered some anyway after the waiter recommended it and was surprised. I got the taco salad and it was one of the better ones Iv'e had. On our way out to the car we had some entertainment as a fight broke out between a couple junkies across the street and one of them chased the other down the middle of the road. So the food was great but the location of the South Phoenix one is a little scary after dark.",
