I think my husband's words were, \"I've had this exact burger someplace else.\"  I concur. And for the price, it was a bit steep. Could have gone to Red Robin for as good a burger and half the price. But, I'm glad we tried this place; I have been a general fan of Sam Fox's for a while. I had the turkey burger and it was good and very filling. Our waitress was very nice, but took so much time with each table that she took forever to get around to everyone. So....I am glad I came but won't be back.",

I'd rank it in my top ten burgers, but to be perfectly honest, it was overshadowed by the Bloody Bacon!  A perfect bloody mary, made with bacon infused vodka, and with a perfect bacon beacon sticking out the top?  Come on!  How can you go wrong?  I've been craving another one for the last month...  Is it nuts to go 2000 miles for a drink?",

Recently I went to a lunch with my bf, her sis and Ma on the fly for her b/day since her first choice failed to be open on a Sunday afternoon..... Not her fault their site said they would be open. Bastards shaking my fist in the air didn't update the site.  D O U B L E Grrrrr! I suggested Zin since we were in the proximity.  So this is my 3rd time at this place. While pricey the portions of everything are large in charge & good. The ingredients are fresh, the meat juicy and the fries are crispy as they should be in my opinion. Note to your mother! Do not waste the fat & gym time on the creme brulee shake. It's nothing more then a fancy name on a regular old vanilla shake. Having said that... I am a creme brulee fan so that may have been it's downfall. I was expecting greatness and fireworks etc. I got a really good vanilla shake though don't get me wrong but name it a vanilla shake. Don't market it as a creme brulee shake. How to improve it and bring a tear to my eye? Put a creme brulee hat on it. Gimmie the crunchy, sweet I'm looking for expect and demand. Just put something on it to give it with that brulee feel or name it a vanilla shake. The best way to explain my feelings would be to say it was like setting up a date with someone on-line and having them show up and it's clear they are photogenic but possibly altered a bit and not the hottie in the pics on their profile. It is some one with a great personality and decent looks for sure just not the hottie. Still had a good time but my expectations were something else totally. The banana cream pie shake is de-lish and the Zin burger a def go. If you want a healthy choice go for the Tuna also very good and served perfectly rare. Mmmmm mmmm good.",

The Truffle Aoli offered with the truffle fries was a little much, so I tasted it in very small quantities.  The Kobe Burger with mushrooms was superb- a great burger! It might have moved to my #1 spot over Delux for hamburger's. We also had the bacon cheeseburger- again - fantastic!   The price is not for the faint of heart. $40 for two hamburgers and fries with iced tea for a beverage is a little on the pricey side.",

And feed me extra in the morning, Seymour.\"   But I was seated at the bar/counter dining area so I decided to order a chicken salad. It was actually quite good and just enough if you're in the mood for something light. Service was also very good. The kind gentleman at the bar was extremely attentive and managed it all alone while dealing with about a dozen customers.   And about that famous burger...while I didn't get to try one on this trip, the gentleman seated next to me ordered one and it looked pretty amazing to me. Big patty with a ton of bacon and whatever else he ordered. I wanted to snap a picture of his meal but thought better of it.   Next time, I'm getting here earlier so I can manage one of those...",

The decor is just ridiculous. It's like a malt shop meets the farm. I just think that they could have done SO many more inventive things. It's a shame actually.   We ordered two drinks and then looked over the menu for food. Our server was nice but she had another two top and a six top and I think she was a bit overwhelmed. She came back about 10 minutes later no drinks in hand but ready to take our order.   We both ordered the Kobe with no cheese and mayo. An order of the truffle fries.   About five minutes goes by and someone drops off our truffle fries but still no drinks. A few minutes later our food comes out and still no drinks. At this point I had to ask for them which is just ridiculous.  I ordered a $10 glass of wine and I seriously asked if the pour was right on it. It was tiny!   The fries had come out cold but they were still decent. Not the best I've has but ok. The burgers were nothing special. They weren't bad but they weren't spectacular either.   I think Fox missed the mark on this one. It's too bad! Save $40 and have a Five Guys burger!",

I had the chicken sandwich, thought the bun was really delicious and ate the whole thing. My boyfriend tried the Sam burger with bacon and thousand island + american cheese and said it was very good. We did start with the zucchini fries even though we thought it was a rip. They were pretty good but nothing amazing, certainly for paying five or six bucks.   We were having a little bit of a Saturday Funday and so I drank a girl next door (pink and fun, really good), and my boyfriend had the margarita, which was also yummy. Both drinks were beautifully served.   Also, I want to mention that the waitresses at this restaurant were doing a really good job. I would even say, a stand-out-good-job.  I'm a big fan of FRC and so as usual, this restaurant did not disappoint.",

I'm sorry, but NO BURGER is that good.  Don't get me wrong, their burgers WERE good.  Zucchini were soggy though.  Unfortunately the guilt was worse than the food was good.  I keep going to these darn burger spots hoping for a miracle which doesn't occur.  Know who makes good burgers...?  ME.  At home.  YOU COULD TOO.    Get the butcher to grind some good chuck.  Buy a good fresh roll from the bakery and some cheese from the deli (all can be done a Albertson's, or AJ's).  Get a cast iron skillet smoking hot.  Salt and pepper each side.  Slap them on for two or three minutes each side.  DONE.  With a nice crust and all to the meat.  The \"crust\" is what I think is missing from the gourmet burgers I've had recently.  If you wanna get fancy grate some jalapenos and put them in mayo along with minced cilantro.  If I am going to spend $30 or more (on food only) it will be for something that I cannot easily make at home.",

The staff Is always friendly and each time has brought out lots of water for my pup to enjoy,   The food is delicious as well. The turkey burger is my favorite and the delicious shakes are heavenly. I love the casual, California type laid back atmosphere. It makes for a relaxing dining experience with friends. The staff is always very patient as well, since my friends and I spend most of the time sitting, talking and catching up, opposed to ordering and eating. The prices are pretty average, not as affordable, but not very pricey.   Also, you can order and pay for to go items from the outdoor counter area, perfect if you have your pup with you and don't want to dine in, but want something a bit more delicious and healthier then the typical fast food drive through options. Also the counter is an outdoor bar area as well with a TV so if you just want a drinks and watch the game, you can do that too with your pup too.

Hostess was not impressive, but then again it is the hostess ( sorry girls/boys its True)  I care more about the server  Server: Fantastic, I would have hired to anything customer service related, offered suggestions and even recommended something and had the chef make.  Food: menu straight forward burgers nothing funny.  The zucchini fries are great as well as there general fries.  I had the Zin burger and added mushrooms and switched out manchego to havarti.  Matthew had the breakfast burger which had a fried egg and avocado.  They offer shakes that sound great, but with a huge burger and fried I did pass.  This place is solid - I recommend over smashburger and Deluxe",

A little messy that way but the lettuce was firm and crisp so it worked perfectly for my low carb diet and was delicious. Although we did have the zucchini fries, zucchini is low carb, right? :)  Anyway they were hot and crisp and the sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend had a regular Zinburger and he said very good and it was cooked perfectly how he asked, that does not always happen at other places. The atmosphere was not overdone for being at Biltmore nor was it too noisy. Did not try the shakes because with my food I was pleasantly full. Maybe next time.",

I've also tried the turkey burger, and it was tasty, but I have no other restaurant to compare it to. The decor is funny. Very cow friendly. At least it's not a bunch of red and white with peanut shells on the floor...  If I ever make it to happy hour, I may add the 4th star.

And they tend to be outrageously expensive. The exceptions are Sauce, which in my opinion serves insipid food, the Counter (it's 25 cent coffee was the deal of the decade) and the new Zinburger.       Of course, Zinburger is easy on the eyes, with it's huge mural of happy cows, and it's lighthearted use of chartreuse accents. Given that it's in the the Biltmore Fashion Park,  $8-14 for various types of burgers isn't bad - and they're big enough to share. Sides of french fries, fried zucchini, etc. are $3-5, and salads range from $9-14. There are lots of milkshakes and floats at around $6. The trouble, as I see it, is that you can get better for  less bucks at Indulge or BluBurger (particularly if you use a coupon). DeLux is a little less expensive, with a lot more food options, although the ambience isn't as pleasant. I won't bore you with what we ate, suffice to say it was merely okay.       My favorite thing is the irony. Zinburger, with it's emphasis on meat, sits a few doors down from Sam Fox's Tru, which specializes in being vegetarian and vegan friendly.",

The meat was flavorful & cooked to perfection and the brioche bun was amazing.  The wait-staff was very attentive and helpful.  The overall experience was 5-star.  I had the Samburger and my wife had the Zinburger and both were outstanding although we agreed the Zinburger was slightly tastier with its braised onions.  We got there at 11:30 AM to beat the lunch crowd but the place was already packed, so pick your spots.  If you think it might be too far to go for a burger or that $10 is too expensive, think again...it's worth the drive and the money.",

My favorite part of Zinburger was the truffle fries. These fries are great!  My burger was good, but a bit dry. The bacon on my burger was very tasty. The bun seemed fresh and homemade.  I was disappointed in my Kit Kat shake. The shake did taste good, the chocolate was good, but didn't taste like a Kit Kat. I think there was a small chunk of Kit Kat at the bottom of the glass. Not worth $5.  The service was very good. The server was attentive and filled our drinks on a reasonable schedule.  Overall, this place falls below what I like in a burger. Maybe I just like a nice juicy greasy burger and not the trendy place that happens to serve a burger.",

Considering what I have come to expect from Fox the salad was TERRIBLE! It seriously was disgusting lettuce with a few tomatos and bacon bits. It was the Large size of the two offered and it was smaller than any other half salad anywhere, Also, we order a burger and fries. It was a little pricey. They do everything al a carte, but come on this is Not Ruth Chris. So if you want a burger fries and soda it is $20 before tip. A little pricey! The burgers aren't big enough to charge that much. HOWEVER, the ingredients they put on them are AWESOME!! I would go back for sure",

    "text": "Hubby, baby and I ate lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  We were excited to eat here, as we are great fans of Fox Restaurants.  During the day, this place is great for kids.  There is a nice patio with lots of open space, perfect for fitting a stroller or high chair next to a table.  It has a nice crisp ambiance, and it's great for people-watching.  The menu is simple, a few burgers, a few salads, a few sides, a few deserts.  The burger options are a bit limited, but the menu does allow you to customize your burger with several toppings with variations ranging from manchego cheese, caramelized onions, avocado to truffle oil.  Hubby and I decided to split the zin burger, the BLT salad and the truffle fries with truffle aioli.  The zin burger was delicious.  It was topped with onions which had been caramelized in Zinfandel, manchego cheese, mayonnaise on a whole wheat bun.  The onions paired well with the cheese, and we were definitely satisfied.  The burgers are cooked to order, and it was cooked perfectly.  The burger was enormous, and we definitely felt as though to feel satisfied and full, we did not need the salad we had ordered.  This was fortunate because the salad was lacking.  The bacon tasted like bacon bits, it was sprinkled with powdered parmesan cheese, the tomatoes were mealy and the \"cowboy\" ranch dressing tasted like Hidden Valley.  It came with what was probably romaine lettuce, but it was so pale, it looked like sad leafs of iceberg lettuce.  We were not impressed, and pretty much left the salad untouched.  The truffle fries were definitely the best part of the meal.  They were golden and crispy, with just the perfect amount of truffle oil.  The aioli didn't really stand up to the fries, but was still good.  All in all, while I would go back to Zinburger, it is definitely not one of the better Fox Concepts restaurants.",

One particular week,  I had my fair share of beef so I decided to try their turkey burger.  It wasn't the usual one on the menu but was a Thanksgiving special.  This burger was exactly the Thanksgiving turkey burger you would imagine - moist turkey burger, cranberry sauce, and stuffing - fantastic.  I was so disappointed they only serve it around Thanksgiving.  After delighting in my usual Kobe burger again for a while, I tried their regular turkey burger and it, too, is tasty (especially with mushrooms).  But the burger with the stuffing and cranberry sauce is something I'm going to indulge in again next Thanksgiving and, being a foodie, I can't wait.",

There is a huge cow mural on the wall, beckoning you to eat him, or one of his family members. So far, so good. I ordered a few drinks, all of which were very good (although pricey). I got the Kobe burger, and good God was it delicious! It melts in your mouth, and all of the flavor is there, stewing in the juices of this mighty burger. I have been back here several times since and without kicking and screaming. This is the only burger place I really enjoy coming back to. Also, the milkshakes are to die for (cookies n cream FTW!). Go check these guys out. Soooo yummy!",

Good luck finding the 3 or 4 very small pieces.  My friends had the new burger bowl which they said was very good.

    "text": "I thought I'd kick the Labor Day weekend off with some burger and fries at Zinburger.  What'd I think?  Hmmm....  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix on E. Camelback Road in what seemed like the business district of Phoenix though I might be wrong on that assessment.  It just seemed the restaurant was nestled among business buildings. Lots of available parking but do note thatme of it is either restricted (not sure why) or is valet parking.  There is a parking lot a couple of yards away from the restaurant that does offer free 2-hour parking if the parking is validated. The restaurant will validate the parking token if you do ask as I did.  The waiter also reminded us to have it validated as well. Interior decor is interesting as there was a large picture of a grass meadow and, if I remember correctly, a cow which I assume has something to do with the fact that the restaurant does offer burgers from grass fed cows.  Interior was also really spacious with a bar, and lots of exterior/interior lighting.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual. There were outdoor seating with misters which was also good.  Seating was adequate and comfortable, and the dining areas was clean.    Menus - both dining and drink menus were easy to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.          Service - on entering the restaurant, staff pleasantly greeted us, and was prompt to show up at our table to take our orders.  Even the wait time for the food wasn't bad.      Food - I had the Zinburger itself which is a certified Angus beef, with Manchego cheese, Zinfandel braised onions, lettuce and mayo.  If you want to make the beef grass fed, it's $5 extra.  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  Even the buns seemed lightly buttered and soft and fresh.  My only complaint was that the burger appeared small.  I guess I was expecting a tower of a burger...something I couldn't hold with both hands and certainly couldn't fit in my mouth.  This burger I was able to comfortably hold with both hands and was easy to fit into my mouth (-1). The vanilla malt shake was very rich and creamy as it should, and came with a straw and spoon, though the latter wasn't needed throughout the meal.     The sweet potato fries were fresh, warm/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.  It's questionable if I'll be back, though the burgers tasted great, they were kind of small (in my opinion) for the price; however, it is definitely worth checking out for yourself!",

I saw the Breakfast burger and just had to get it. It comes with all of my favorites.. avocado, bacon, mayo and topped with a fried egg! Anything with a fried egg on it is good to me. lol. The burger was amazing and beyond delicious. I also ordered the Creme Brulee Milkshake which was soooooo good! You have to try it! We also ordered the Double Truffle Fries. It was good but it came with this weird Mayo dip which I was not too fond of.   Everything was really amazing, HOWEVER the service... my oh my... Let's just say it was very disappointing... We ordered ranch and ketchup for our fries which never came. We had to flag down another waitress to get it for us. Also, our water cups were pretty much always empty. I almost felt the need to go to the bar just to get more water. =/ The waitress probably checked on us maybe once the entire time we were there.   This place really does have amazingggg burgers! I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the poor service. I also wish there was one on my side of town as well but you can't win em all! =0",

The Breakfast burger was so good! Fresh avocado, a perfectly over-medium egg, and expertly fried bacon. And, when you ask for \"medium,\" they actually cook it medium. Plus, when our server, Ernesto saw our shirts, he asked about the race and gave us free desserts! What?! His service was great...even without the free dessert. Their beer list is pretty okay, wine list is impressive for a burger place, and the cocktail list was very tempting. We're just visiting from Sacramento and might not have the chance to come back, but I'm so glad we chose this place during our trip!",

The chopped wedge salad though, arrived at room temperature and the lettuce, not so crisp.  Generous on the bacon, egg, tomato and dressing but not as good as it could have been.   My dining partners enjoyed the parmesan topped truffle fries that were hand cut.  We appreciated the efficient service even though our server didn't look too happy today.  I  had a better experience this afternoon than I've had at their North Scottsdale location.  I would dine here again!",

However, our last visit was with a large group for my nephews birthday. We ordered the kids their meals first in hopes of avoiding any meltdowns. About 15-20 minutes later the adults began to order their meals. The adult meals came out first with the kids waiting another 45 minutes to eat. Half of the meals were entered incorrectly and/or were never placed by the server. The experience on this particular evening was a real struggle. It may be a while until I'm back. I like the food, but the service needs to improve.",

The burger I ordered was delicious, a messy monstrosity called simply \"Breakfast,\" which with an egg and avocado combined two of my favorite meals: breakfast and burger. Service was good and this place had a laid back sleepy diner feel. My only gripe: if you are going to make a delicious burger, a regular hamburger bun seems out of place. Try a toasted Kaiser roll or something else unique, like for a sandwich called \"Breakfast\" perhaps two pieces of toast.",

I opted for the signature burger with manchego cheese and braised onions and mayo on a soft bun. That cheese melted perfectly and the beef was soft, but well done and each bite was very tasty with the flavor combinations. The only miss was the side order of zucchini fries which needed to be more crispy. Nobody likes a limp fry, but otherwise a good burger and good lunch. They validate also.",

Everything about this place makes me happy, the double truffle fries are amazing, they're shakes are inexpensive and divine (cookies and creme is my go to) and every aspect of the burger is delicious. The buns are soft never dry, I love that they use shredded lettuce instead of leaf lettuce so I can actually taste my burger, and I love the option of being able to build my own burger. My biggest critique of burgers is how they are prepared. If I ask for medium rare, I really don't want to eat anything but medium rare. I've gone to other zinburger restaurants and have been burned a few times with my burgers coming out well done but this location has it down, perfect ever single time. I seriously appreciate it!!  Best time to go is Monday-Friday from 4-6 pm for happy hour!! Half of sides and fries, $7 Plain and Simple burger which I always get and then pile on the toppings, and drink specials.   I have tried to branch out in the burger department and have found some close alternatives but Zinburger, in my opinion, is the best burger place!",

He made sure to keep our iced teas replenished and was totally accommodating when I built a complicated veggie burger. And, oh, that veggie burger! I'd been wary of Zinburger for years as I've had repeated mediocre experiences at Sam Fox restaurants, but was made a convert when a friend had Zinburger cater her baby shower.   I'm usually not a fan of burger buns, but the veggie burger bun is simultaneously substantial and light. The veggie patty also sets itself apart from so many other restaurants that seem content on doling out frozen Morningstar patties. Soft, fresh, and tasty, it's filling without leaving that heavy feeling in your tummy.   Don't forget the sweet potato fries either! Hand-cut, crispy, and fresh, they pair well with the accompanying yogurt or with ketchup.",

There were about 16 of us that needed a place to eat and they were able to get us in within two hour's notice.   When we got there our table was still kind of trickling in and the server was definitely behind. I got the nutella shake and it was pretty amazing. I also got the sloppy joe turkey burger. It wasn't anything amazing but I couldn't resist a sloppy joe.   The rest of my party was a little disgruntled with the server not being able to understand the drinks that were being order. Either that or the bartender wasn't too competent. One friend ordered a prickly pear and it wasn't nearly one. He stuck with it because he just wanted to get some alchy in his system.   Another friend order a Kentucky Mule and it was a little drawn out. Just substitute the Gin with Bourbon! It's pretty simple.   Kudos to the server for keeping her cool despite her frustration with taking on a large table at the last minute.",

I knew that hitting a place in Biltmore wasn't going to be a frugal experience, and I was cool with that. I'll pay more for good food. but I have to admit that I have a really hard time paying $10 for a burger that doesn't come with ANY sort of side. And fries? Yeah, those are $5. And I realize a lot of places charge $12 or $13 for good, upscale burgers and Zin's combined cost isn't far off of that, but it just feels rip-off-y.   (Note To Restaurant: if you bumped up burger prices $3 & gave 1/2 the amount of fries, you'd prob get better feedback from customers PLUS bump up your margin. It's really just perception.)  That said, I have to say, the burger was freaking delicious. I got the Diablo burger, piled high with roasted jalepenos and carmelized onions, and it really was amazing. The burger itself was cooked & seasoned perfectly. The sweet potato fries were also very good. Not a fan of the yogurt sauce that comes with them, but whatever.  Interestingly, their wine prices aren't half bad. I had a very tasty malbec / syrah blend for $6. That's not too shabby, as it seems many places less expensive than this are charging more.  Bottom line - great \"splurge\" place if I'm in the 'hood & have a craving. Not a regular place for me.",

As someone who was afraid to eat my spicy chicken sandwich due to the \"unhealthiness\" the waitress gave me support... Quite a few times. As someone who is in recovery, this meant a lot to me. At one point her coworker even gave me a high five because I ate half of my meal, which was a pretty big deal. It meant more than they'll know probably. Between the waitress and her coworker, they made the experience fun, enjoyable, and hey, they food was really good!!   I suggest the spicy chicken and Mmm it think I'll go back for those fries!

Kobe burger was fantastic.  Truffle fries a little disappointing but not bad.  Service overall was really good - fast and friendly.  Bartender was totally swamped and a little grouchy but no big deal.  We were staying at a hotel across the street and there is a great tunnel that goes to the Mall so you don't have to play Frogger with the traffic - bonus!

I've been to most of the other popular and trendy places but Zin keeps on living up to the best!  On our latest visit we were seated in the heated patio. The wait for the restaurant was nearly 30 mins or seating right away on the patio. It was chilly out so I was happy for the heat lamps! Not bad at all with them on.   My wife and I decided to share this time.   It was hard to do, but since its the new year, I wanted to start things right in my whole diet and exercise plan.  Cutting calories in half is a good start right?  We had the ringer with avocado added.  All I can say was wow. Excellent! In the past we have had the Kobe burger with pineapple which was a special back then, and we have ordered that numerous times.  It's been almost a year since I tried that one though. We also shared the truffle fries which were great.   All in all, it was just the right amount of food for us. I would say this is our fifth time here and I never had a bad experience hence my 5 star review. I think the Ringer is my new all time favorite so I'm sure we will be back here soon for it again!!",

Our server did not appear back at our table after the drink orders were served until someone in our party asked the hostess if she could get her.  (someone else brought the food).  We were the first to be seated outside  -- and diners seated after we were who were  next to us were offered refills and were checked in on at least three or four times while we were there.  It was hot and our drink glasses were empty before the food came out.   One refill would have made that $14 hamburger more enjoyable.   When the server finally came over to give us our check, it was sorry I had a big party.  Okay so younger me know that we weren't important enough for you at least hand us off to someone.   I won't be back for quite a while.",

The best burger I've ever had, coupled with amazing service. I suppose it could be cheaper, but you're paying for quality, location, and atmosphere.   I wish I didn't like it so much, because I like to try new places. But Sam Fox does restaurants too well, especially this one, which just never disappoints.  Best and most consistent service I've ever had.   Also, I hate vegetarian reviews of a burger restaurant. Come on, seriously?",

    "text": "A burger and fries place, only upscale!  Zinburger offers beef burgers which are a mix of Angus and Kobe style beef for your standard patty, although you can use 100% Kobe for $5 more.  They offer several different variations on the standard burger and fries, and also offer a veggie burger, chicken, ahi tuna, and turkey for those that aren't beef inclined.  They also offer upscale milkshakes ($6 each) with flavors such as bananas foster and creme brulee.    We ate here for dinner on a Sunday night, and had a fairly large party to seat.  There were no problems getting seating for us when we arrived (Around 5:30 P.M.), and service was prompt.  I had the bananas foster shake ($6), double truffle fries ($6), and a veggie burger ($9).  I also had some of the El Diablo burger ($10).  The shake was thick, rich, and had a nice light banana flavor from the fresh bananas.  The ice cream they use here is Breyer's, which was a nice touch.  The double truffle fries were nice and they were hand cut, but a lot of our fries were \"frylets\" in that they were smallish pieces of potato rather than average sized strips you can easily grab with your fingers (Versus having to grab a lot at a time with the \"frylets\").  I could taste a lot of white truffle flavor from the white truffle oil they used in both the fries and the aioli.  The aioli itself though tasted like white truffle infused mayo rather than a garlicy aioli.    The veggie patty was nice in that it tasted like it was made fresh vs. using a already-formed patty.  It was a black bean mixture, and while the sides of the burger had a nice crunch to combat the mushy texture of the bean patty inside, the inner part of the burger tasted like mushy black beans.  Perhaps some grain inside of the burger would help to provide extra texture.  In addition, it was nice that they added smoked mozzarella to the burger, but I couldn't taste much smokiness nor much cheese although it was melted on the patty.  The veggies accompanying the burger were fresh and plentiful, including large slices of creamy avocado.    The El Diablo burger I tried was better.  It was juicy, and cooked perfectly to order (Medium), and had great beef flavor from the burger and the spicy condiments.  So, going to Zinburger, if you're not a vegetarian, your best bet is to stick with the beef burgers, and be sure to get a yummy shake to go with your meal.  Your taste buds will thank you!",

It was tasty and cooked to perfection; however the morel mushrooms were literally pulverized along with all the other mushrooms. You couldn't differentiate between them in the miasma. My only criticism about the burger is that if you are going to use a very expensive ingredient, please do not destroy it and make it unrecognizable.   The fries were hot and fresh, and the ranch dressing I asked for was tasty.   My friend ordered his burger medium rare, and unfortunately it arrived medium well. He ate it anyway because he was hungry and didn't want to wait any longer (they were very busy so the long wait for our food is forgiven).  The hostesses and servers buzz around the restaurant as if it were a hive; constantly cleaning, picking over the tables, asking if anyone needed anything. This is awesome. The only bad thing about the atmosphere is the customers, themselves! The crowd was VERY loud. Screaming children, women drinking too much wine and talking at the TOP OF THEIR LUNGS when it's not necessary to. It's a very loud experience.   I will be back. Definitely not on a packed Saturday night, that's for sure.",

The bar tender must have been afraid of me as he stood 4 feet away and only spoke in very short and broken sentences. Fox restaurants leave a lot to be desired, generally.",

The zucchini fries were so salty after about three bites I could not eat any more.  As previous reviewers have stated this place is expensive.

I had heard great things about Zinburger, including from my Tucson in-laws, so my husband and I decided to try the place out.  We arrived at Zinburger at about 7pm on a Saturday night. The place was packed so we grabbed a beer to wait by the bar. Two seats opened up at the bar and we decided to have our dinner there. It was a bit too loud to really have a conversation with the bartenders if we wanted to, plus they seemed very busy, so we looked over the menu and with the recommendation help of some of my Twitter friends, we made a decision on our meal. My husband and I decided to split the Zinburger and the Turkey Burger with a side of Zucchini fries and sweet potato fries. I drank a Widmer and hubby had a couple glasses of Tobin James Zinfandel. A really yummy, jammy inexpensive wine. Our fries came out first and they zucchini fries were fantastic. The sweet potato fries were \"so-so\" and the dipping sauce that accompanied them had to of been a mistake. It tasted like a cucumber sauce for a Gyro. Our burgers came out and all I gotta say is DELISH. Wow. I wasn't sure about having a turkey burger for dinner, but it was fantastic. Lots of flavor from the garlic in the meat mixture. I wish my hubby had ordered it with the mayo, but it was darn good. The signature burger is the Zinburger and it definitely was tasty. Super savory and juicy from the Manchego Cheese & Zinfandel Braised Onions. I wasn't thrilled to eat warm, super soggy shredded lettuce on the burger though. They should take that off or maybe use an iceberg leaf. All in all, great burgers. In fact, I now think the Zinburger is my favorite burger. That honor used to go to Delux. Oh, if you do decide to get some wine, be careful. They charged $10 for a glass of the Tobin James Zinfandel.  You can get a bottle of that for about $12-$13 at Cost Plus, etc. The mark up on the glasses of wine are ridiculous.",

The chicken salad was small for the price and was not that memorable.   The burger was on a fresh, toasted bun, with beautiful wine-carmalized onions and plenty of mayo. The cheese was nice and gooey. I ordered a medium burger, but it was served well done, so the flavor had disappeared.   My major disappointment was on the truffle oil fries. If you are going to indulge in the calories, fries should be hot and crisp. Unfortunately, these were room temperature, unevenly cooked and kind of greasy. The truffle aioli was not that memorable either.   I did not indulge in one of the milkshakes (some amazing sounding recipes on the menu), but will when I try it again.   The wait staff was friendly and they kept the soft drinks filled.",

The truffle fries are magical, especially with the dipping sauce.  I have only had milkshake, but it was creamy, thick, and chocolately.  I like the idea of being able to have wine or beer or a milkshake or all three with a burger.  I love the bar, which is massive and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I also enjoy the giant pasture painted on the wall with the signature cows.  My gripe with Zinburger is, of course, it is pricey.  To get a milkshake, burger, and fries, you are looking at spending $25 and that's without tip.  Yikes.  Now if you come with a friend or date, you can split shakes and fries to make the price less sticker shock.  Zinburger is definitely one of the few restaurants that makes me wish I had a sugar daddy.",

If it was recommended by two locals, it has to be good, right? It was! We had the kobe burgers that came with cheese and sauteed mushrooms. It was excellent, the burger was full of flavor and quite large. We also tried the creme brulee shake...delish! Also the zuchinni fries and the sweet potato fries are a must have. We ordered way too much food for the two of us to finish but it was well worth the visit...we left full and satisfied. I'd recommend this to other people visiting the area.",

    "text": "2.5 stars is more accurate....just can't give it 3.  Stopped in with my wife and daughter for lunch and sadly left unimpressed. Service.....good. Setting......good. Food and price......not so much. I ordered the Kobe Burger and a side of fries and was really looking forward to great flavor. I mean if a brother is going to drop $15 on burger and $5 on fries, I am expecting above average. Upon arrival, visually both looked tasty. The meat was very juicy and was impressed. The rest, not so much. Where is the flavor? Where is the salt? Neither existed here. I should not have to salt my own grub when dropping $20 bucks for burger and fries.   My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad. She thought it tasted okay but again, thought it just did not taste great or even good. My daughter ordered the kids cheeseburger, which came with fries. At $3, this was a great value for what she got. If only I would have dropped her off and my wife and I ate elsewhere.  She thought her meal was great. Kind of sums it up if you ask me. The place hits the flavor palate of a child.   We did try the vanilla malt and it was tasty. For $5, I would probably order again but doubt this guy will be back.    In closing, $50 for a family of three here for lunch is a joke when it comes to taste. I have no problem spending that for burgers and fries but know that your customers demand more when they are spending more. I would not recommend and will continue to send my yelpers to Paradise Valley Burger Co.",

The boy got the $3 kiddie burger, which is a killer deal. All burgers were cosines with much delight.   Katie, who was our server was phenom! Her service truly made the dining experience top notch.  Katie noticed my daughter and I were talking about splitting our burgers so we could try each other's. When the burgers came out, they were both cut equally so it made it easy to split and mix up our plates. Mind you, we didn't have to ask her to do this. She did it on her own, which was very much appreciated and stands as a True testament to what a wonderful server she is. She also split our milkshake into two glasses knowing we were sharing. Katie.

    "text": "I had a Fox Restaurant Concepts gift card. I am a big fan of True Food, Flower Child, and even Sauce--but my husband is a fast-food eater who is easily freaked out by what he perceives as hoity-toityness anywhere near his food. So ... Zinburger it was.   We arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday. There was one party awaiting a table ahead of us. We asked for patio seating, and even though several tables were visibly unoccupied, they told us to wait 10 minutes because \"they had lots of tables that needed to be wiped down.\"   Once seated, we were promptly greeted by a waiter who asked the now-standard question: have you been here before?  (WHY DOES THAT MATTER?? Unless there is some secret to navigating your menu that 30-plus years of restaurant dining hasn't prepared me for (is the sushi arriving on a boat or being served off a naked body? Do I have to cook anything myself? Are any foodstuffs on offer not actually legal?), you don't need to ask this. You just handed me a two-sided menu with all-text graphics. BIG BLOCK LETTERS THAT SAY BURGERS HERE FRIES HERE WINE HERE. Numbers that equal dollars I will trade you for burgers.  You are the waiter equivalent of that office d-bag who reads every slide of his PowerPoint. Don't be that waiter.)  I asked to build my own burger. Before I finished saying that, the waiter explained that they have a special right now with their plain burger that you can add three toppings. OK, that would have been a more suitable preamble than \"here's how menus work.\" I chose to upgrade to the \"American-style Kobe beef\" and chose roasted peppers and avocado (there aren't really very many topping options for those avoiding dairy, so I couldn't find a third). We also ordered fries to share, which they offered to bring out before our burgers.   The fries were good. I don't like salty, so they were fine by me. Most people would probably add salt.  The burger was ..meh. I think shredded lettuce is gross and kind of down-market. The burgers were the big, tall kind that photograph great in magazines like Texas Monthly but that don't actually fit in mouths. For my money, I'd just as soon eat at Smashburger. If that makes me a philistine, so be it.   They have some very tempting milkshake flavors but we were planning to go a few doors down to try Frost Gelato.",

    "text": "Zinburger is one of those places you have to go to when you are in Phoenix.  The restaurant is right off Camelback across from the Ritz Carlton in the Phoenix financial district (i.e. great location).  The food here is ZINTABULOUS.   My wife and I had the Chicken lettuce burger with Franks Hot Sauce!  Aw yeah, that is awesome!  We also had a burger that was phenomballs and sampled the fried zucchini (which was also absolutely delicious) and threw in the Chili fries just to sample - BWOZA, another winner!!  We took part in the happy hour (before 6 p.m.) which offered some killer pricing and selection, and watched a ball game on tv overlooking the city scene in the background.  The only thing better than the food was the service.  The waitresses and hostesses are so friendly and personable that you feel like you don't want to leave!!!  That is how you do it.  Zinburger is a great place with a great vibe and this is one of my Phoenix Fav's.  Get the chicken sandwich with Franks Hot Sauce and tell em Attorney Steve sent you!  PS.  Our waitress was Kira, ask for her.....she is simply the best!  - Attorney Steve -  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.attorneysteve.net&s=3215599e071c285f7a772415148832074db72d6cc22ec3990a0cf95539eb0d48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">attorneysteve.net</a>",

Only reason I give it a 4stars because it was 12.00 just for my hamburger. That didn't include a drink or fries. I have ate at other similar restaurants and usually 1 side is included in the meal. I think a side should be offered or a small appetizer while waiting. I probably would only go back if its on a date night movies and dinner. There are plenty of hamburger places in my location that are a little more reasonable. Although the food was yummy I was hoping I found a \"wow\"factor here but didn't. Give it a try . Its worth a try.",

    "text": "There are many ways to make a great burger. This place stands out by promoting the freshness and organic nature of their patties. This location is at a mall. Parking is a bit weird there is free parking north of it, but south of it you either have to get validated or valet. Choose wisely. We went on a Sunday for lunch and there were a lot of people there. We waited for about 15 minutes because we wanted to eat inside. The workers were dressed like they were on the farm, and the decor kind of matched that. The patio is shaded and had misty sprays on when the temperature gets too hot. The restrooms are very clean and have some interesting decor. You'll have to see it for yourself.  This place is known for their burgers and shakes. To start off we decided to share a salted caramel shake. The amount of the shake is good for one person, but you can also share it and still be satisfied. When it arrived, it was very thick and luckily they give you a spoon to go along with it. I decided to get the Zinburger ($10). It comes with Manchego Cheese, onions and mayo.  For $5 more, I decided to get my burger Kobe style, which is to use Kobe beef. We also ordered a truffle fries and loaded fries. The loaded fries came with bacon, cheese sauce, sour cream and chives. I preferred the truffle fries over the loaded fries. The fries were not as \"loaded\" as I liked them to be. I would have liked more sour cream with them. The truffle fries were great. You can smell them from a mile away and taste just as great. The burger was huge. The meat taste fresh and went well with the toppings. My one gripe with it is the bun. I felt that it was a bit dry and it was holding it back from being one of the great ones.  The service here is pretty good. Our waiter was friendly, kind and helpful with choosing what to order. She was quick to refill our drinks and our food was served in a timely fashion. No complaints there. Would I come back here again? Sure, if you're looking for a place in Phoenix to pig out then check this place out!",

Over all my experience was not great. I didn't like the taste, feel or the overall burger at all and I would not go back. The only thing I was actually pleased with was the chocolate mint shake.",

Yea, really odd choice, and kind of uncomfortable to be eating a burger and having Elsa the Cow, with very sad eyes, staring at you while your biting into one of her relatives. Other then that, I feel that they did a good job on the decor. Really nice in fact.  Now I ordered the Zin Burger, and it was very good. I mean as I was eating it, it was as good as any burger that I have had. As good as Gallo Blanco, and Hula's. Very juicy, flavorful, I liked the bun. It was a 5 star until I stopped eating it. Yep, then it lost a star. How? After I was done, my mouth turned into the Salton Sea. Holy crap, easy on the sodium chef!!! Way too much salt. Now I know what salt does, but overkill. I actually tasted salt for the next hour.  You had me with everything else, just don' t want to feel that I just sucked on a pretzel.   Only other complaint is the pricing. Like everyone else on here, I think the pricing is all wrong. Especially if your going solo. I mean as a single diner I have to order a basket of fries? I thought Delux was stupid for doing so, why make the same bad move. I also saw most people sharing a burger. If thats not a sign, when customers have to get creative on how to eat at your place without breaking the bank, take a good hard look at how you might make your customers more happy.

I asked to be seated by the bar - was told I could go right ahead. Then came my struggle period. It took the bar tender 20 minutes (timed by the watch) to look towards me and offer me a menu. I asked for a recommendation - was given a lackluster answer. I ordered my wine and buffalo sandwich. It was mediocre at best. The Pinot Grigio ($5 a glass) was fine. I was not served water throughout the meal. I finally spent another 10 minutes trying to get someone to get me water. This was a wednesday night post 9 pm.... it's not like the place was bustling with people. Even though I live around the corner, this is a place I will not go back to.

    "text": "This was our second visit.  Our first was an excellent intro.  Service was very good and the burgers first rate - meat was cooked properly, tender and with enough char to make a pleasant crunch.  The sweet potato fries were crisp on the outside and mellow within.  Very much a pleasant burger experience.  This second visit was disaster.  The food remained as above but  the service dropped like a rock.  After waiting an interminable time we had to flag a passing waitress to call our to take our orders.  That done, we then began another wait for our food to arrive.  Enough to say it arrived well after other patrons who arrived well after us had been served.  It appeared our waitress was more interested in developing her social skill than in serving the patrons . Needless to say we felt both ignored and abused.  More of this and Zinburger might find it's business rapidly falling off.  They just lost two who thought they had found Phoenix's burger place.",

Next time I am in town, I will stick with the burger. The truffle fries were YUMMERS in muh tummers! And I had the Chocolate Zin Bar shake (I think that is what it is called). Chocoholics only for this one! It is a chocoholic's dream! I could not finish because I went a little heavy with the fries.   The bartender was amazing! She is friendly and really on top of it. This is also in a great part of town. The atmosphere is fun too. More casual than most of the other restaurants around which is what I was looking for.",

I only had three glasses.  So if your in Phoenix and want a great lunch or dinner I would highly recommend Zinburger!!!!",

You can add just about anything to your burger (and any of the themed burgers on the menus can be swapped for a veg patty) and they have a big variety of fries to choose from too. I got the sweet potato fries with dinner and they were great, especially dipped in the yogurt sauce they come with.   Service here is phenomenal - really friendly hostesses and bar staff. I loved the indoor/outdoor bar and they turn the heaters on at night if you want to sit outside even when it's a little chilly.   Only downside - this place is a little pricey. For a beer, fries, and burger my total was about $25 before tip. It's not your average cheap burger joint, it's defiantly a fancy deluxe restaurant with a casual vibe. Just go close to pay day.",

    "text": "Every time I have entered this establishment, I am a bit dusty and untidy in my appearance. (Hiking the peak nearby manages to make me look less than serene). On my last visit,  I see sidelong glances my way from patrons who look casually elegant, as I ask for a table for 2 for where ever and when ever available.  There was a wait for the warm interior; but lucky for me,  the patio had no wait, as the temperature outside was very cold.  I was nice and comfy with the patio heater and my sweats.  This is a casual place, but my dusty hiking clothing may be too casual for some of the patrons, so sitting outside was nice.  As for the burgers, well, I have not had one I did not like.  The last burger I ordered was The Ringer - Applewood Smoked Bacon, Frank's Red Hot Onion Rings, Pepperjack Cheese & Mayo.  We substituted the mayo with avocado, then asked for it to be cooked medium.  It was perfectly cooked with a nice pink middle.  MmMmMm  Of course we had to order a side of truffle fries.  Luckily one portion is good enough to share.  I like dipping them in their chipotle mayo.  My server was upbeat and friendly.  However, She did forget to deliver 2 place settings.  Before I can make her aware of the problem, she was gone.  I just shrugged it off and dove right into the food.  Who needs the extra set of silverware in a burger place, and heck even the napkin when you are too busy stuffing your face?  I did need a knife to spread my chipotle mayo evenly on my bun, but I fixed that by using some fries.  I will be back to try the breakfast burger.  But since I consider this a good reward after hiking,  I will be back in my dusty hiking boots!",

I really like how open the feeling is when you're at the bar. That's probably because the sliding window is still up since the weather is nice.   The turkey burger I had was delicious with lettuce and cheese (I added jalapenos for a kick) and mayo. For my side, I ordered the half & half fries...yummy!  I like that their ranch isn't a traditional ranch. Drink wise the Hop Shoch IPA had a kick while the pomegranate mule was refreshing & light.   Even better was the service. Alex was my bartender & he kicked ass. He was friendly without being fake & handled business well as it got significantly busier throughout my meal.   Sam Fox, I've said it before and I'll say it again; I doubt you could develop a restaurant I don't like.",

The customer service was good, the decor was okay, but the burgers just didn't wow me.   The waiter was nice and there wasn't really a wait. It looks fresh and modern on the inside and there was ample seating.   I ordered the El Diablo burger medium rare. It came out a little too close to well for my personal tastes, and it wasn't spicy. That was pretty much all I was really expecting from the burger. Medium rare and spicy, lol. It wasn't a bad burger, it just did not live up to my expectations.   All in all this is a 3 -star place in my book, just A-OK. Not bad, not great.",

Fries are not included and must be purchased separately, tried several varieties of the fries, again not bad but not memorable. Passion ice tea was pretty good.

    "text": "I do love to rip Sam Fox places, because I think his approach to restauranting is \"MAKE DA MONEY, WHO CARES BOUT DA FOOD!\"...usually. But I have to say, Zinburger at the Biltmore is deserving of its 4-star Yelp rating; which is to say it's a pretty solid place for a quick bite or maybe even a good meal. Been here a few times and the first visit was less-than-stellar, with an unprofessional waitress, cold fries and in-general blah feeling about my time and $40 for two lunch.  However, as of late, it seems the Zin is looking to Win. Had a very nice dinner with a friend here recently and the service was pretty good, the water-refill-girls were on-point, and the food was actually good.......and tasted fresh. Had a salad and I kid you not, the ingredients had the texture and taste of farmer's market quality.  Had their burgers in the past, and pretty decent. On-par with Delux down the street I would say. Fries...meh, not Zinburger's strong suit. But DAMN, hoss, it's an S Fox joint so you KNOW the wine/liquor list be KICKIN! Booze. It's how this chain makes its $$$.  If you've been to the Biltmore you know parking is a breeze. The grounds are clean, and the location is central. It's almost comical how bad restaurants can exist in such a class environment. But Blanco next store is gra-oss; and the \"Asian Fusion\" place that **used to be** in the Blanco space was hideous. Whatevs, anyway Ziburger is a solid corner lunch and dinner spot. Tables are adequately spaced apart and the noise level, while healthy, is not obnoxious...impressive considering there is a sizable bar in the center of the space.  Zinburger. Pretty OK. For a Fox spot, that's a victory.",

Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She even reminded me to have my parking token validated (which I always forget at this mall) No complaints there.   The food was OK. My tablemates ordered a Simple and Plain Burger (he was a kid), a craft your own burger and I ordered Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Veggie Burger. Keep in mind that this is an a-la-carte restaurant. If you order a burger, you get a burger. Doesn't come with fries or other accouterments. My guests seemed happy with their meal. My Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Veggie Burger wasn't all that great.  To be called \"Almost Famous\" I was expecting more.  The bad. Well, that must have been the acoustics, virtually impossible to have a good conversation. Typical Fox Restaurant really.

    "text": "After much debate on this important issue of our times, I believe Zinburger is the best burger in town.  Saturday reaffirmed my belief.  The casual restaurant is bright and open, but you're not there for the ambience.  The menu is confusing, but you can basically order exactly what toppings you'd like a la carte without busting your wallet.  (That includes substituting a chicken breast or turkey patty.)  I recommend havarti cheese and either avocado or fried egg, but not both.  The egg brioche bun is large, but it's almost necessary to sop up all the moisture and flavors.  And the fries and sides stand up to the burger.  We ordered our favorite, zucchini fries.  That's healthy, right?  Not really, but the battered, fried zucchini sticks sprinkled with parmesan are amazing.  The onion rings suffered by comparison, but they were also more than adequate.  We were too full for shakes on this visit, but I can assure you that they're also delicious.  My one issue with this place is that it's hard to finish a burger without it falling apart.  Maybe that's a result of my topping choices.  That's a small burden to bare... I'll bring a bib and a dropcloth for burgers this good.",

The Samburger is also really good, but I think the Zinburger is much more flavorful. I haven't tried the veggie burger, but friends I've dined with have had it and loved it. They always have a special burger of the week too, and they usually sound pretty good. But I am a creature of habit and have yet to try one.  Side dish-wise, I've tried the regular fries, truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini fries. The truffle fries are amazing! I really enjoy the sweet potato and zucchini fries too, especially the tangy yogurt dipping sauce that comes with them. But the regular fries are super disappointing... you would think a burger place with several delicious different types of fries would at least have good ol' regular french fries. Unfortunately, the ones I've tried have been soggy and not very flavorful. Regardless of what you get, the sides are huge and can easily be split between 2-3 people.  I can't imagine having room to order a shake too, but they all look delicious, I might have to give in one day. My boyfriend did get the root beer float one night, and I definitely stole a few (several) bites. If you can somehow manage to save room for it, get it! Or do it as he did and order it as an \"appetizer.\"  I've heard some complaints about the wine, but I always order the Tilia. It's only $6 and if you like cabs or malbecs, you'll definitely enjoy it. For beer drinkers, they have a limited tap selection, but they are all good craft beers.   Yes, it may be a little pricier than your average burger joint, but I guarantee it's better quality too.   Although, I could do without the cows on the wall watching me eat their friends. Sorry cows! Please don't judge me... you just taste so good!",

I had the California Burger Bowl, which was a burger patty with avocado, sweet potato, and zucchini. We ordered truffle fries and zucchini fries for the table, which I did indulge in and they were quite delicious.  Service: just okay  Seating: They have an outdoor patio, which is nice. We had a big group so they couldn't accommodate us outside. Indoor seating is decent but not designed for large groups. We were split between booths, but they were gracious enough to give us adjacent booths so it turned out okay.",

He was very rude from the start. If you are going to work in customer service change the tone of your voice and facial expressions to something less obviously annoyed and rude. Once we were about to leave and left a tip and he had a question about it he sure did perk  up. Also the beer I ordered was just handed to me in the can and he gave me a cup? I'm not sure if that's usually protocol but it seems as if the usually have it already poured for you... Other than that I'm giving it two stars instead of a one star because the food was delicious!!!",

In anticipation I waited, only to be served a burger; just like any other burger. I pictured this wine flavored burger that was going to rock my world! It was an average burger. I must of misunderstood and thought that this was a signature dish.   The atmosphere and scenery were good. Being located in the Biltmore Plaza shopping location gives you great options for movies, coffee or a great stroll around local merchants. I'll be back. The vibe was good and the place was crowded. So, I must have misfired on this one.  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

A byob option begins at $8.50 with $1.50 charge per additional topping for the creative. I had the diablo which was quite spicy but more of a jalapeno level, not reaper or ghost pepper. Burger was big (bartender says 6 oz) so was filling. A side fry shared would be best to complete this meal. They also have a nice $5 hh menu for sliders of 3 oz and had off wine and droughts. The one downside I found was the very small beer selection. Usually burger joints specialize in beer selection and Zin disappointed me for sure in that department. Service solid at the bar and quick and responsive. As far as the cook and meat - top notch; but I still look for a full experience of food and drink and Zin just didn't stand at the peak in the beer department worth of a 5 Star.",

    "text": "Zinburger specializes in burgers. They offer a variety of burgers along with salads, appetizers, milk shakes and a few other items. The standard burger is a 6.5 ounce certified angus beef patty that is fresh ground in house two times a day (according to my waiter). This is a casual restaurant with wait service. They offer a full bar and have indoor and outdoor seating. They validate your parking so you can park for free for up to two hours in-front of the restaurant.  I decided to try the Bruce Lee Burger because it sounded delicious with Asian Slaw, Sriracha mayonnaise, Jalapenos, Avocado and a few other things. It also was noted on the menu that this Bruce Lee Burger was a WINNING Burger in last year's \"Burger Battle.\"  I received my burger and the plate was garnished with a few what seemed like freshly made pickle slices that were tasty. I go to take a bite of the burger. I can't bite into it because it's to wide for my mouth. I remove half the bun and I have to eat it open faced with a knife and fork. It's mighty delicious and still a big sloppy mess. The burger has a tasty caramelized outside and the inside is big with flavor. All together they made this taste like the best potsticker with dipping sauce I ever had. Did I tell you that this is really messy and juicy? This is messy but really good. You might not want to eat this on a first date or in-front of your in-laws. You need to eat this burger by yourself or only with someone you can fart with.  My husband had the Diablo Burger. He was pleased with the burger. They cooked it medium rare like he asked for and he said it was the best burger he's had out in a while.  We were happy with the burgers but service wasn't perfect. We planed to share a salad that didn't arrive before the burgers or with the burgers so we brought it up with the waiter. The manager generously ask us to take the salad home for free but we declined. It turned out for the better because the burgers ARE VERY FILLING. Both of us were full and really couldn't eat anything else anyway.  The only other thing I'm not completely happy with is the decor. The place is nice but they have a big picture of beautiful cows in a pasture. It makes it hard to stomach beef when you gaze at the beautiful cows.  Anyways-  If they prepare the Bruce Lee and Diablo Burger the way they prepared ours was I can say they were really delicious burgers that you should be happy with.",

We were by the Biltmore and hungry....Though the menu is pricey for burgers, it is relatively reasonable for restaurants in the Biltmore. I feel like you are paying for the vibe.....which is fine with me since it really is a cool spot. The server was sharp and attentive and the Carburator burger with an egg on top was just what I needed. YUM! My husband had the Kobe burger and gave it a 4 out of 5. The only negative thing I can say about the place is that they need to eliminate the tables for two with the molded plastic chairs. I get that they have a modern vibe, but no one wants to float out in the middle of a restaurant in an uncomfortable chair while others enjoy the comfort of a banquette...just sayin' .",

First of all, who wants to dine on a huge burger while staring a huge mural of a cow in the face? Not me! Makes me feel bad. Probably a big reason I am a fan of Chic'fil'A, eating chicken while staring at a cow, awesome! Anyway..... the decor is cool enough, other than the giant cow watching you eat his cousin.   On to the food. $10-13 for a burger seems to be a standard these days for the upscale burger joints. So, it didn't really bother me. If it came with a side it would have been perfect. So the roommie and I want to get a good taste of everything so we shared a few options; the turkey burger, a glorified bacon/cheddar burger, double truffle fires, zucchini fries and a mint chocolate shake.   1.) Turkey burger - probably the best I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, great flavor and seasoning and the toppings were great. Cabbage rather than lettuce is a genus idea!  2.) Bacon/cheddar burger - meh.... could have gone without ever having this thing in my life. First of all we asked for it to be cooked medium and when it showed up the bun was a bloody mess, I would call that rare. The bacon and thousand island dressing battled to the death and neither won. Way too over powering for such a dominating burger. Over all, wouldn't order it again, ever!  3.) Truffle fires - how do you f*** up truffle fries? It's damn near impossible. They were great. I could tell they were freshly cut and were served with an awesome aoli. Get 'em!  4.) Zucchini fries - blech! Almost sent them back just to get them out of my face. Looked awesome and tasted worse than original Cheerios. The batter they are in sucks, is soaked up all the oil from the fryer, and were as soft as noodles. I tried to make myself eat 3 of them but couldn't take it anymore.  and finally...  5.) Mint chocolate shake - it was okay, in the most generous way. Way too much milk was added so within 5 minutes is had morphed into this sloppy-slushy-watered down concoction that bored me. Flavor alone, great! But the texture, disappointing. I will stick with the Diner, where they know how to do it right.   I have to say the staff was great. Very friendly and were there to take care of any need we had. But for the food itself, I will only ever be back for my once every other month turkey burger craving.",

    "text": "Since the Zinburger was offering a 2 for $30 restaurant week menu and my BFF and I have been wanting to try this place for a while, we popped in for our BFF date night.  There was a wait for two; but since there were seats open at the bar, we opted to sit there. I was totally fine with that because my back was now toward the wall with the cow mural on it. I personally feel a little awkward eating a burger while a cow is staring at me. Even if it is a painting.  The service was initially slow at the bar, but it was really busy when we got there. After that, the bartenders were attentive and friendly.  The restaurant week menu was 2 glasses of wine, 2 burgers, and a side to share for $30. That's a good deal. We got the Zinburger and the Samburger and split both. We ordered both cooked medium; one came more medium rare and one more medium well. I like my burgers more medium well, so I was ok with that one, but had to think past the extra pinkness of the other burger. My only main complaint, but they were still very tasty. The onions on the Zinburger were super yummy. Our sweet potato fries were so good as well and appreciate getting those before our burgers to snack on while we waited for the main event. This was enough food to stuff us.  Next time I'll have to split one burger and fries so I'll have enough room for dessert. I'm a sucker for banana cream pie and that's on the menu. After the wine, I tried the vanilla lime sarsparilla cocktail.  The combination sounds a little strange, but it was super tasty.   Everything was super good and the restaurant is casual cool.  I will be a repeat visitor.",

Taste was ok, but had to eat it all with a fork because it was so loose and crumbly...so, didn't really taste like a burger at all when eating it with a fork. it fell apart the first time i picked it up. not impressed either with the fries being a separate item on the menu, and for $5.00 extra at that. For these reasons, i give it 3 stars, but everyone else i was with seemed to really like it. I'd probably not bother going back, personally.",

On a recent trip, I had the Zinburger signature burger which was moist, tender and flavorful.  Even the soft, yet sturdy, bun was good!  The Sweet Potato Fries came with a yummy Yogurt Dipping Sauce; totally worth the extra $5!  To drink consider the well-poured Lemon Sipper (Skyy Vodka, Mint Leaves, Lemonade) to cool off on a hot, Phoenix day.  I ate indoors, but they have a wonderful, relaxing patio, too.  This place is great for lunch with girlfriends after a day of shopping, but equally as fitting for a Saturday night date.  Kids are welcome, but they'd probably be happier at Mickey D's down the street.",

Their burgers are huge, and my guy and I have decided that the best course of action is to order 1 burger (they will half it for you and bring out each half on its own plate) and 2 sides (zucchini fries, sweet potatoes, or truffle - they're all good!)   I usually get either the turkey burger or the Zinburger, and both are excellent.  I wouldn't recommend the salad, as I had one once, and for $10 bucks, it was awfully small and not worth the money.

    "text": "Definitely coming back here with hubby and kids.  First time was with girlfriends for ladies night out.  None of us have been there before but wanted to taste the food, see if the reviews are right.  The food was delish! We sat by the corner booth.  Got seated right away.  Waiter came and took our drink orders right away.    Highly recommend:  Zuchini fries - we all couldn't have enough.  We ordered another plate.  It was crunchy, you can taste the zuchini.  great substitute for fries.  (if you have to order fries, go with this one.  skip the sweet potato fries - they were good but the zuchini fries are better, and pass on the truffle oil fries - you can taste the truffle oil and they were good but boy, the zuchini fries surpasses them all!  Bananas Foster shake - it was dessert in a drink.  You can taste the bananas and the caramel.  Consistency was perfect.  Yum!  My girlfriend had a taste and took one to go, after we already had dinner there.    Had the regular zinburger and it was perfect!  Ordered medium well and it was slightly pink in the middle but that's ok becuase I've been warned by the other reviewers.  Thick patty was still juicy and moist, great seasoning, simple lettuce, tomato.  The burger was tasty.  I could only finish half  because I wanted the shake more.    I didn't have room for dessert but GFs said the choco cake was heavenly!  I'll have to come back and try it another time.  Service was quick.  We got our food right away.  Waiter was attentive and helpful (he recommended the bananas foster shake over the tiramisu)  Overall: yes the $10 pricetag on a burger without fries seems steep, but you're at the Biltmore, what do you expect.  It was good burger and the patty is like 2 inches thick.  Definite thumbs up!",

While in the bathroom we shared a great conversation about how terrible subway was. Our waiter was Joe. He was very nice and explained how they use great teamwork with other restaurants nearby. My date ordered a double with egg and bacon. I ordered a burger with bacon and green peppers, and cheese. The burger was a little soggy and moved way to much in the buns. I eventually took the buns off and just ate the meat. I do like to be more carb Conscious. The food was amazing though I have to say the decor of the place made me feel like I was in a Shasta pool store. Joe was a great waiter though loved my sense of humor. Told him I was yelping and he offered a deal about saving ten dollars to email sign up but who wants another email. Would definitely come back here.",

    "text": "***Zinburger is a small Phoenix burger chain from a restaurant group (Fox Restaurant Concepts) that has several restaurants--mostly in Phoenix though I think some of their restaurants are coming to Los Angeles; the food here is okay but definitely not as good as some of Los Angeles' great burger spots like Father's Office and Short Order***  Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which is an upscale outdoor mall just outside of Downtown Phoenix.  Biltmore Fashion Park has a few upscale shops like J. Crew, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn, but it seems to have even more dining options--a lot of chains from upscale ones like The Capital Grille to moderately priced ones like California Pizza Kitchen.  Zinburger seems to be one of the more local or at least regional places here.  Zinburger has a clean and simple indoor dining room.  The dining room is very minimalist and no frills, but it is modern and comfortable.  An outdoor dining patio is also available, but it would probably be quite uncomfortable dining outside during Phoenix's hot summers.  Because Zinburger is a burger spot, prices are not too high for dinner.  Zinburger is a gourmet burger spot though so burgers run $10 here.  You can upgrade to an American Kobe beef patty for an extra $5.  All sides are a la carte and are large sides that are suited for two or three people.  Salads are also available as well as an assortment of shakes and not just traditional flavors.  Shakes are very dessert-focused here--shakes based on popular and longstanding desserts like creme brulee, strawberry cheesecake and bananas foster.  Zinburger's menu setup is also a tad similar to The Counter.  Like The Counter, Zinburger has a build-your-own-burger option where you can choose between quite a few toppings, cheeses and sauces.  The Counter showcases special burgers (and I believe shakes) for the month and so does Zinburger.  I had Zinburger's El Diablo burger.  The burger came with fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, and chipotle mayo.  I also upgraded the patty to American Kobe beef.  The burger itself was pretty good.  It had a good flavor and was juicy enough.  It did not have the juiciness of a very great burger, but it was definitely not dry.  I am not sure how much the American Kobe added.  I have never been a big fan of American Kobe beef; it lacks the richness of Japanese Kobe.  The burger patty was good though their regular patty might be good as well.  The toppings were okay.  The burger was not too spicy.  It could have used a little more heat though occasionally the burger had nice heat.  I wish the burger had greens though to add freshness and balance.  It seems like a lot of their signature burgers lack greens and lettuce, which I think is a big miss.  Their hand cut fries were just okay.  They were thin fries and they could have been crispier.  The zucchini fries could have been crispier too.  The flavor of the zucchini fries were good though and they came with a decent Parmesan ranch dipping sauce.  I had their Bars of Zin shake, which was chocolate ice cream, melted chocolate and praline flakes.  The shake had a good consistency.  It was smooth and thick but still very drinkable.  The flavor was good.  It had a good chocolate flavor without being too rich.  The praline flakes were just okay.  It did not add the crispiness I would have preferred.  Service was good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.  As already mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Overall, you can get out of here with a filling dinner for not that much money.  That being said, the burgers and shakes here are expensive for casual food given their gourmet label and significant portion sizes.  Zinburger is an okay burger spot.  In terms of flavor, I would definitely put it above a spot like The Counter.  I would say though that Father's Office and Short Order are significantly better than Zinburger and I would even prefer spots like 25 Degrees over Zinburger too.  As mentioned earlier, Zinburger is located in Biltmore Fashion Park, which offers both pay self and valet parking.  Zinburger does validate parking (I believe they validate up to 2 hours).",

I see people saying it is pricey and the burgers are ok.  On the other hand, there burgers are quality meat with toppings that shine bright like a diamond.  i really don't know why I said that, maybe adding to the milkshake theme I had going earlier, but in all honesty, there are various toppings to choose from that makes them different than any chain burger place.  The location is great with the decor and ambience relaxing for a great date night in the Biltmore area.  I cannot complain about service, because it has always been top notch whenever we went.  You definitely pay what you get for being in the Biltmore area.  We will see you again you delicious milkshake and sweet potato fry!",

    "text": "Housed in the Biltmore District in Phoenix, Arizona. \"Zinburger\" is a wine and burger bar for wine and burger connoisseurs alike. The restaurant is vastly open, welcoming, and equally trendy. Upon arrival, our party was greeted and informed that there was a slight wait of 20 minutes as expected during the dinner rush and happy hour. The host took a name down for our party and in turn we distracted ourselves by further examining the restaurant. The walls were brightly colored, with ample lighting while the tables and booths contrasted with a dark finish. The staff looked happy and were dressed in a uniform that was simplistic and neutral with an earthy shirt that read the restaurant name and a pair of blue jeans. Around fifteen minutes had passed and the host informed us of a table being available. Each member of the party was handed a menu that was simplistic, yet extensive with a myriad of combinations and selections of burgers, other small plates, and beverages. Our server, Denise had made her appearance within a minute and inquired if our party had ever been here before. Two of the four of had, so Denise explained to the other half of some of her favorite creations and about happy hour specials that discounted glasses of wine, sides, and fries by 50%. A major benefit to a price sensitive consumer. Taking advantage of the specials, each member of our party ordered a glass of wine that was respectable in size. Denise offered a little more time to peruse the menu and enjoy our beverages. Every item on the menu sounded delicious, especially since we were so hungry. I ultimately decided on \"El Diablo\", a burger that was served with jalapenos, caramelized onions, lettuce, and chipotle mayo. Even though each burger is served a la carte, a side order of fries or another side is necessary, especially at half off. Just like the burgers, the fries and sides are far from basic. My complete order was an \"El Diablo\" burger, cooked medium, with a side order of zucchini fries. Although, we anticipated a long wait for our food, just as we did to be seated. It was the opposite. Our food came out speedily and more importantly, correct. I looked at my plate which held a burger weighing in heavier than your average burger, plated with the zucchini fries that were dusted with parmesan seasoning that included ranch for dipping. I picked up the burger and took my first bite. The food was the prime temperature of being pulled off the grill, but not so hot to where I would regret taking the first bite within seconds of Denise excusing herself. The bun was nicely toasted and the burger offered a slow burn with a flavor as opposed to some foods that are spicy just for the sake of being spicy. I paced myself with a few of my fries that were an even and lengthy cut. Zucchini fries are an art form that seldom restaurants are able to master, because they cool so quickly and the breading tends to slip off. Denise came to check on us and joked the entire party was silent, so the food had to be good. The food was so good, none of us needed boxes. Overall, the entire experience was excellent. The food obviously being an important factor, but more often times than not service trumps food quality. Our server was polite and equally serviced each of her tables with an invisible hand. While Denise was present, it did not ever feel as if she was sitting at our table. Our waters never ran dry, she asked about possible refills when the other beverages reached a midway point, and never seemed elsewhere with her thoughts. The atmosphere, service, and ultimately the food is something sensational. My only regret is that I did not take Denise up on her offer of finishing our meal with one of their sweet offerings. Heed my advice, save room for dessert.",

    "text": "We had some time to kill after a schedule change left us stranded at the Greyhound Station in Phoenix. We ditched the bus station and asked a cab driver to take us somewhere - anywhere - interesting. We ended up at Biltmore Fashion Center and were dropped off near Zinburger. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=bHZobMw7BzUv5Thd211_QQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  We saw many diners enjoying burgers, shakes, and fries, and asked Ichabod if he'd like something to eat. He seemed excited about the restaurant and chose barstools for us near the pleasant outdoor patio dining area.   We ordered:  * Roasted chicken salad with organic greens, pomegranate, marcona almonds, and goat cheese dressing  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=5lTby7rzAD3Japndi95ykg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  * Burger of the day - angus and brie with truffled aioli. The flavor of the cheese overpowered the meat, but it was still tasty. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=d0aoEc0hSLAppfbY3MNhtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  * Fries - limp, greasy, disappointing. How does a burger place mess up fries? They looked better than they tasted. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=mGD30C-GrVFNzmaCRU-9jA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  * Black cow float - root beer float with a tall glass packed with vanilla ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could justify charging $6 for it, but the price made more sense when I saw the amount of high quality ice cream and the premium root beer. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=kSz0KDrt4SPLOaPr26CFSw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  Mr. L and I shared the salad and burger, which they split for us, and brought in succession. That made dining easy and enjoyable.   Our server was borderline unpleasant and impatient, and gave me the impression she wanted us to order quickly and be done with us. When she gave us our check, she made one attempt at friendliness, the last-ditch \"don't stiff me my tip endzone play,\" which we witnessed her do with another customer at the bar. Strange. In contrast, the other Zinburger servers were consistently pleasant and very helpful.   The bovine theme here is pervasive, from the cow decorations on the walls <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=ljBTfOt7fXWa15uq55A_lQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a> to the trough sink in the ladies room. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH9sL3XGFpoJXcxUpEWA?select=_-qDTkIuzpxOMk1RgJ5z4w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/-rhH...</a>  From the burgerlicious food to the fun atmosphere, I can see why Zinburger is a popular eatery.",

Dipped in ranch dressing, they are little fried pieces of heaven.  The beer and wine specials during happy hour are also very generous.

I was craving a burger and had seen this place mentioned a few times being named as one of the \"Best Burgers in Phoenix\".   I decided to come down and check it out.  Pay parking which you can get validated.  They use plastic tokens...reminded me of a small poker chip.  Anyways..........walked inside and was seated against the wall.  My server came over and asked me if it was my first time here etc.  She went over the whole drill.  I decided to order the Zinburger (minus mayo), an order of fresh cut fries and a Diet Pepsi to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.................  Zinburger-  ($10.50)  This is a ground beef patty (I'm assuming 1/3 lb...it was a good sized patty) topped with manchengo cheese, zinfandel braised onions, and lettuce.  I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect.  It was presented nicely but it was lacking greatness.  I took a bite of the meat itself and it tasted really great...like steak!  The cheese was melted on top of the burger and the onions were layered nicely on top of the cheese.  It came on a soft \"fancy\" bun.  Each item itself was great...when combined though, it left something to be desired.  All I could really taste was bread and onions.  The meat/burger was not the star of the show.  The lettuce addition was a little weird too.  It probably would have been better without.  It was a decent enough burger but for a \"fancy\" higher end burger joint, I expected more.  It ain't cheap either!    Hand Cut Fries-  ($5.00)  These things were actually really good.  They give you a nice sized mound of them.  They were hot and crispy and delicious.  They needed just a bit more salt, but other than that, they were really good.  Better/more memorable than the burger.  Diet Pepsi- Is what it is.  Why only 2.5/3 stars?  For a burger, fries and drink, it was $19.98...that is before tip!  I will never ever ever ever ever ever pay $25.00 to come back here for simple comfort food.  It's just way too expensive for what you get!   The staff was all pretty friendly, the layout is cool (kind of a hipster vibe), and they validate parking for up to 2 hours.  I am glad I came to check it out, but sadly I will not be returning...the value is just not there.  Once I hit that lotto and move to Scottsdale, then we can come here often lol.",

    "text": "Well it's another weekend and another Sam Fox Concept restaurant to try.  Life is so boring here in the Valley.  LOL  There have been quite a few \"premium priced\" burger places popping up lately.  So, in many ways Zinburger's only competition in this category has been Hopdoddy. Both are upscale $10 plus burger places, that have interesting choices of tastes, add-ons, buns, etcetera.   The food at Zinburger is very good. It's served fast and you won't feel like your wallet took a major hit. Our bill came to $33.00 before taxes and gratuities, which is expensive when only compared to the \"In 'n Out\" and \"Habit Burger\" of the world. But for us, it's the Zinburger's taste which we feel is unique and worthy of their premium price that makes us want to come back and we will.   We tried their Kobe Burger ($15.00), Sam Burger ($11.00) and Zucchini fries ($7.00) and blown away the experience. The Sam had applewood smoked bacon, cheese and 1000 island dressing, which all worked well together. But the star was the Kobe, which is served simply with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and mayonnaise.  You have to try it, it's delicious. Really!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 2.5/5 Happiness - 4/5  Zinburger is fine. I feel a gourmet hamburger walks a very fine line. On its own, hamburgers are easy to make and incredibly delicious. Typically, I find that gourmet placed add too many ingredients, play with the meat too much, use buns that are ill-fitted for hamburgers, and in so doing, ruin the brilliance of a burger. I have been to gourmet burger joints that have elevated, but more often than not, they careen down the chasm of bad burgers in their belief that bigger is better. Zinburger teeters on the edge of too much tinkering.   The meat is always loose, wet and lacks much in the way of flavor. The buns they use often seem overwhelmed by the massive amount of toppings that accompany most burgers. The toppings themselves are typically unnecessary (to be fair, you can build your own burger).  What Zinburger does really well is virtually everything else. The milkshakes come in a good portion and are very delicious (and look great). The regular fries are forgettable, but the zucchini sticks, sweet potato fries and especially the absolutely delicious truffle fries are worth the extra price. The beer and wine list is nice and the bar is well set-up. There are always plenty of kids around, so they are very kid-friendly too.   The managers are always very nice and receptive. We ate there recently and my mom felt her meal was undercooked. With no questions asked, the manager gave us 25% off our meal. And the restaurant was jam-packed, so she surely must have been busy dealing with far more problems than my mom's unreasonable definition of \"well-done.\" Yet she took the time to make us feel special. If only the food were as good as the service.",

I asked for a double patty (extra charge) and got a single instead (which the server took off the bill). The couple next to me also had service issues. Because it was so slow, I don't understand what made this whole experience unsatisfactory. The burger was good, but not as good as any other Fox restaurant's burger and the service was bad.

    "text": "Does the Camelback Corridor really need another fancy burger place? No.   But Zinburger is giving it a whirl anyway - with mixed results. I tried a Samburger, which comes with 1000 Island, applewood-smoked bacon, onions and usually mayonnaise (which I changed to Dijon mustard). The beef is excellent quality, and was actually cooked medium-rare as I asked. The buns are just right. The bacon is top-shelf. I'd prefer a thinner, wider patty to the beef puck Zinburger uses. And I'd like less grease. The bottom bun was saturated with enough lubricant to melt the rust off the hull of the Titanic.    Now, about the sweet potato fries. Sweet potato fries are old news. They are the culinary equivalent of the phrase \"think outside the box.\" My suggestion? Kumara fries (and no, kumara is not just a sweet potato - they taste different). Or better yet, get really original and bake them rather than drowning them in oil. I'll also add that Smashburger's Smash Fries take Zinburger's sweet potato fries to the cleaners.   And this place needs some condiments. Each table, at minimum, needs ketchup and Sriracha. Mustard (preferably stone-ground or Dijon) would also be nice. I'd also dig Worecesteshire.   Finally, let's talk drinks. If you're going to do beers on tap, get away from Guinness and get bold - and really, $6.50 for a Guinness? This is not a super-premium brew. Four Peaks is a nice addition since they're local, and I credit Zinburger for that. But overall, the beer selection is a bunch of tepid, unoriginal retreads. The milkshakes look awesome. All the originality that could've gone into the beer selection wound up on the shake menu. I really have to go back and try the date shake. I won't say anything about the wine since I only vaguely care that it exists.   Bottom line - burger and fry-wise, not much new to see here. You can get burgers just as good (if not better) at Fez, Delux and even Parlor if you can bring yourself to not order a pizza there.",

Every week after I would drop $1500 at Ralph Lauren @ The Biltmore, I would monitor the progress of construction to await the opening.   Well last night was the first time and it was a disappointment. Not for the food, but the service. First: if asked to sit on the side patio, DON'T! It is a bastion of emptiness and inattention. Ordered cheese burger and fries, the fries arrived first and the burger 20 minutes later. I attribute that to \"out of site- out of mind\" of sitting in side patio Siberia.   Second: if a 6'9\" waiter with dark black hair & anorexic like build is introduced as your waiter: RUN! It was painful to deal with him and his total ignoring. If, however, you are a bevy of underage, under dressed girls, \"Lurch\", as we affectionately named him, is your guy. He will hover over your table and your blouse  to the detriment of his other customers.   Even more painful was feeling the loss Condor endured by listening to the great waitress our neighboring table had, particularly when describing the delicious nightly Specials I didn't hear about until after I ordered!   Overall, the buzz Condor missed inside was worth a second trip. Will let you know whether any other \"Addams Family\" waiters are there. i fear \"Uncle Fester\".",

I went to this restaurant with my mum for a Memorial Day lunch (not a particulary special occasion). We were seated very quickly, and the server was very attentive, though his knowledge of wine was a bit under par. One of the main defects of the menu is the lack of \"origins\" for the various wines on offer. As someone who is particular about his California wines, this is not good. The Lemon Zipper cocktail (which my mum ordered) was quite tasty, and she likened it to a Mojito without the rum.   I ordered the SamBurger, substitute cheddar for American Cheese, and mum ordered a basic burger with avocado added. We both opted for medium well done, and really, it seemed more like \"well done\" to me. The burgers were meh. Ok, but not special. DeLux Burger this place isn't. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were tasty.   So, overall grade is a C, with the following breakdown Service - D (downgraded from C-; this place is called ZinBurger,                        a server with under par knowledge of wines is not good)Food -     C+ Drinks -  C+  For a better burger, I recommend DeLux Burger on 32nd Street and Camelback.",

I had a glass of chardonnay, and although everything was cooked to perfection, this place would have gotten five stars if it weren't too expensive for everything ordered. Not to mention the hostess forgot to give us kids menus and were not brought to us till it was time to go.  We basically just had to ask if they served kid burgers, no big deal.  But we will be back next time we are craving melt in your mouth burgers.  Oh, and happy hour looks like a great time to fill up on wine and food for the best prices.",

    "text": "Ok. I tried - Several times. But I just don't get how this place is getting good reviews for their burgers. I understand people raving over the shakes - they are AMAZING! The fries (especially the truffle fries) are super delicious too. They've got excellent, inventive cocktails and a good wine selection. But the burgers? Bleh.  Even if I hadn't read any reviews before I went, I would have assumed that a place that supposedly specializes in burgers would have figured out how to make a pretty spectacular burger. I guess I assumed wrong. I've tried a few different kinds but have always ended up with salty, but otherwise flavorless burgers.  All in all this place would get five stars if it was a malt shop that served fries, but unfortunately they decided to showcase their most inferior menu item and charge an arm and a leg for it. That gets a big negatory in my book. Sorry Zinburger. I'm sure I'll be back for a shake and fries at some point, but otherwise I've learned my lesson.",

    "text": "So the hubs and I were starving yesterday, I say hey its the last day of restaurant week, lets go try out Zinburger...Totally didn't read the FAQ that RW is only for dinner, so that was a bummer, but oh well.   We got there and a few people were standing around waiting, the hostess said it would be a 15-20 minute wait, I think we only waited about 10.   Our waitress was awesome, she was really nice and quick.   We both ordered Zinburgers medium well (as those fancy burger joints like to serve their burgers bloody) and a side of Fries. She asked if it was ok that the fries came out before hand and we said sure.   Now, for $5 for a side of fries, I was expecting a large portion. If you go to the Original Wineburger (19th and Bethany) and order a side of fries its a small for like $2 that would easily feed 2-3 people or a BUCKET of fries for under $4 that could feed 3-4!!! So right there Zinburger looses a star, the prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! The fries were tasty, but nothing special and certainly didn't warrant the price for the portion, the portion is a joke and isn't a good size to split with anyone. Lame.   The burgers came out about 10 minutes after the fries. They were fantastic! I almost ate the whole thing (But I wanted to save room for the shakes) But again its the pricing that gets me and keeps me from giving this place 5 stars. I would have been ok spending $8 on these burgers, but $10 for a burger....that doesn't come with a side is dumb. I know its at the Biltmore and all but damn people, its JUST burgers.   We ordered a kit kat shake to split. They brought out our shake in two smaller portioned glasses, that was a nice touch. The shake was good, but kinda soupy. The whipped cream is for sure out of a can.   Overall it was a good experience. Would I go back? Yes. But I wont be happy about being bent over and robbed.   If you want a great burger and don't want to take out a second mortgage on your house, then go to The Original Wineburger on 19th and Bethany, the burgers aren't as fancy but just as good or maybe even a tad better. The prices are right and you can order a couple Baviks and appetizers and pay less then you would at Zinburger.",

We all loved our burgers: ZinBurger, Turkey Burger, Weekly Special, and Kobe Burger. Burgers are about $10 and then sides are $6ish. We got almost all of the sides but I highly suggest the Zucchini straws - amazing! The burgers were large and juicy. It is a bit pricey. You decide if it is worth it.   I tried the Bacon Bloody ($8). I love bloody mary's and i love bacon so i was pumped for the marriage of the two. It arrived with a piece of bacon as the garnish - nice touch. Sadly, it fell a bit short for me but the two boys loved it. The drink tastes exactly like it sounds but it was pretty intense.   The decor is a bit odd. There is a huge mural of cows grazing on the wall while we you chow down on that exact fury friend. Kind of creepy but we went with it.   It was great overall! Love the Biltmore area. I really enjoy Fox Concepts restaurants.   Eat and be merry!",

Both times I ordered the Zinburger sub the veggie patty and add truffle aioli. Both times it was great. I will admit our first visit we each ordered a side of fries which was way too much food. One order is enough to split between two people. The milkshakes are stellar and are alone worth the trip to Biltmore.  Definitely expect a wait if you go during the weekend. Other than watching others get to eat before you, I have no complaints. Good service, good food, good restaurant!",

There are a variety of options, tons of toppings and options, a veggie burger (if you're into that sort of thing), and a bunch of different types of fries.  I've been twice, I had the Kobe burger once (not worth the extra $, because the regular burgers are so good on their own), and the Samburger last time I was there. Both burgers were really good, but I thought the fries were a little underwhelming.   The best part of the menu to me is their milkshakes. Awesome milkshakes. Keep in mind though, you'll be taking out a second mortgage to buy a burger, fries and milkshake (no joke those three things will run you $25 + tax/tip). Only other real negative is that there always seems to be a wait. It's not that big inside, and I don't want to sit outside when it's 100+.  There are a couple spots that I think have better burgers, but Zin is a very, very good option in Phoenix.",

    "text": "So the burgers are good, as most people on Yelp have posted, but the experience could be better for a number of reasons.  We had the $20 dinner \"special\" for 2 - where you get 2 burgers, 1 order of fries for $20.  So when I got the bill, I was charged $21.25, and not $20 (this is not including tax), so I was thinking \"wait the special is advertised for $20, NOT $21.25!    The server informed me that I was charged an \"extra\" $1.25 because I asked for onions on my burger! WTH!??  Are you serious??  The server never said that I would be charged extra for onions - so be careful when you order here, because Zin likes to add deceptive charges - what a Sin Zin!  Shysters.  I reluctantly give 3 stars because the burger was good and the service was also pretty good.  But Zin should include some food on the side with their burgers, because when you order a burger you are getting it stand-alone, no fries, no veggies, nutin.  If you want to add \"extra\" on your burger, be careful.",

    "text": "I've had two recent opportunities to try out this place.  It seems there has been a trend in the Valley: there are a lot of newish burger places.  Some of them are chains (Five Guys, Smashburger), and some are gourmet burger joints (Delux, Zinburger, etc.).  I, personally, always welcome a new burger joint.  My first visit, I was flying solo on a Friday night, and sat at the bar.  This isn't the type of place at which you would typically want to be seen dining alone on a Friday night, but I will always maintain that it is my friends who are lame, not me.  Thankfully, the girl working the bar was nice and friendly.  Zinburger definitely gets points for friendly service.  I also appreciated that they let me drink a bottle of the Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda that they presumably use for the 50/50 floats.  Having a bottled or on-tap soda with my burger always makes the meal more complete.  As far as the actual burgers are concerned, I'd say they're pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  The toppings are where they shine - there are about a dozen different cheese options, as well as bacon, avocado, peppers, wild mushrooms, a fried egg, and a variety of sauces that aren't listed on the menu.  Get a good combination, and a medium rare burger there really is quite respectable.  The double truffle fries are also excellent, and the zucchini fries aren't bad (though I couldn't even eat half the order).  And right now, they have a blackberry peach lemonade that is spectacular.  Finally, a word on the shakes: they're good, but not $6 good.  Truthfully, this place is borderline five stars, but the only reasons it's not, in my mind, is because I've had Diablo Burger in Flagstaff, and you can plan on spending at least $20 for a burger, side, and a drink.",

The service was great - the hostess, bartender and our waitress - just wish the burger matched the rest of it.   We left feeling \"eh\" - and not planning our next trip back.

    "text": "Really disappointed with this place.  Actually, I shouldn't say that I am wholly disappointed with the place as much as I am disappointed with the quality of service that I get for the outrageous price.  The wife and I weren't terribly hungry (after a killer breakfast from another of FRC's spots - True Food) but it was lunch time and we weren't going to have a chance to eat again till much later so we wandered over to Zin burger.  Cool place.  Nice inside.  Looks like most of the newer FRC places.  Good vibe, crazy walls, wicked wait for a burger place.  So we each got a milkshake and then split an order of sweet potato fries and a bacon burger.  The milkshake was a double chocolate mint shake that was excellent.  I didn't think the $6 price tag was outrageous but when it came out and only 1/4 inch of my spoon was sticking out of the glass, I was a bit annoyed.  You know you have shakes, you are the ones who bought the glasses, maybe buy some shake spoons?  For $6 I shouldn't have to fish it out.  Anyways, it was good.  Better than most restaurant shakes, so I was happy.  The fries came out next.  Thought it was a bit odd since we didn't order them separately but I guess the waiter thought they were our appetizer.  The yogurt dipping sauce is very tart by itself but it a perfect compliment to the fries.  The fries are also bathed in salt so I enjoyed them very much.  In all, the fries were good but the presentation was pretty cheap.  The ramekin of yogurt was sitting on the fries inside the paper-lined basket.  It had spilled on the fries.  I'd prefer a plate.  Finally (and I do mean FINALLY...like 35 minutes after ordering), the burger came out.  It had been cut in half, which I appreciated.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was pretty tasty.  We gad ordered the Samburger because my wife likes bacon but I really wasn't feeling that bacon.  I wished it had the turkey bacon from True Food because the Applewood Smoked bacon that was on there was hard and tasteless.  In all, it was a good burger.  Was it a good $10 burger?  Not really, but half is enough to fill you up, and if you split it, it is only a $5 burger.  For $5, it is great!  Now to my final complaint and the thing that would normally make me turn this into a 2 star review but I know that they are going to fix it.  Despite their intention to fix it, it was still left this way and still screwed up my experience.  If you sit in one of the booths behind the hostess table, you have a perfect view of the men's bathroom door.  No big deal except, and this is a big except, when someone opens that door to go in...you get a full on view of someone using the urinal.  Now that kind of thing might fly over around 7th Ave & Indian School but not at Biltmore and not for these prices.  I do not want to watch people urinate and do all of the other things that guys do while they are in the bathroom while I am eating.  I'm sorry but it was gross.  Lastly, don't have Harold as your waiter.  He was snotty, insistent, and inattentive.  He took plates before we were done, had an attitude when we asked to split the burger, and continually ignored us as he attended to the larger (and subsequently more lucrative) table next to us.  I might give Zinburger another chance but in reality, there are enough burger places along Camelback (Modern Burger, Grind, Culvers, Smashburger, Wineburger, etc) to keep me occupied for a while.",

However, as a valley food lover I must say bravo to yet another successful venture, Mr. Fox!  I am rating Zinburger a 4 purely in alignment with the other restaurants I've experienced. While it may not be as sophisticated as Modern Steak or trendy like Olive & Ivy, Zinburger has a sleek setting with a great casual outdoor bar and some delicious food!  We started with Sweet Potato Fries with Yogurt Dipping Sauce, Double Truffle Fries (Truffle Aioli & Truffle Oil) and Zucchini Fries (Parmesan & Ranch). All of them were good and would definitely satisfy any salt cravings you might have - so make sure you have a Zin Stinger (Red Zinfandel, Chocolate Sauce, Simple Syrup, Mint Leaves) close at hand!  There were 4 of use, we tried the Turkey Burger (with Swiss Cheese, Avocado & Mayo), Samburger (with Nueske's Applewood Smoked Bacon, American Cheese & Thousand Island Dressing), Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (with Pepperjack Cheese & Ranch Dressing) and lastly the Kobe Burger (with Cheddar Cheese, Wild Mushrooms & Mayo). They were all fantastic, The Kobe and the Turkey were my favorites.  We passed on the shakes for dessert and went for the Banana Creme Pie (YUM!!) and Chocolate Creme Pie. They give you 1/4th of a pie!!! It's a huge slice. I am pretty sure at this point, I should have stopped but when staff recommended the Bacon Bloody Mary, how could this foodie resist??   That's right...Bacon-Infused Vodka. The Bacon Bloody Mary. Because I am hardcore, I went for it. It was really good, I just wouldn't recommend pairing that with Dessert and wouldn't do it again.  All in all, a great experience typical of FoxRC. I'll be back for more, and really enjoyed the relaxed experience and patio at the Biltmore Fashion Park.",

The el Diablo burger has a kick to it because of the peppers, which make it very flavorful! Fries don't come with the meal. You have to order it separately. I had the zucchini, sweet potato, and truffle fries. All were fried to a crispy perfection and tasted great! I will definitely come back when I visit Phoenix again!",

My husband and I got the Bianco burger it was cooked to perfection they offer a more expensive burger patty which in my opinion is not necessary it's very flavorful already. The other couple ordered the blue cheese and BBQ burger, all yummy! The \"truffle\" potato fries were disappointing esp for the price,  my friends got the sweet potato fries - All I have to say is Thank God They Share!!!  (YUMMY... best I've had). The place is at the Biltmore plaza surrounded by lots of ritzy restaurants and shops it makes for a  nice walk around after a meal.  Our server was polite enough, could've been more helpful but in this neck of the woods that's better than some. Don't know how the wine selection is I was in the mood for a good brew, choices were next to nil - a few IPA's and a couple of boring standards. They don't have a happy hour here just in case you were curious. Let's see..... over all was a good experience but won't replace our fav. for awesome burgers, beer battered fries and a great beer selection it's back to Four Peaks Brewing Co!",

I have eaten here about 6 to 7 times because I work across the street and when you work with a bunch of guys a burger joint comes up a lot on the \"where should we go to lunch\" question.  I like the way the restaurant is set up, with open air concept and the large cow pasture mural on the wall. It takes me back to my Midwest days.  But the burgers here are just eh, they have good flavor but to me a True burger enthusiast should want a simple burger and not have tons and tons of toppings or options and I find almost every burger place now-a-days does this. I guess I just miss that simple part about the Midwest.  By no means are their burgers awful its just my personal preference...  I do however enjoy the double truffle fries! They are dynamite!   If I had to pick between this place and FEZ I would go with this Zinburger hands down.",

Not that the food was terrible, but it was just mediocre.  First of all, I had to wait for a table... Usually a good sign!    The waitress was about 16, she knew nothing about wine and was totally incabable of answering questions.  The waitstaff bus their own tables, so it takes longer to turn them.  Then a 17 year old server was arguing with the 16 year old hostess about seating his section.  Terrible.  People... sweet potato fries taste pretty much the same everywhere, lets calm down... mmmkay?  Thanks.  This place blows a hole.  Fox Restaurant Concepts is hit or miss.  Bloom is a miss, True Food is a Hit, ZinBurger is a miss, Sauce is a hit.  etc etc etc.    If you want a good burger and an overpriced bottle of wine that the server knows nothing about... i suggest going to 5Guys Burgers, grab one to go... and get a bottle of wine from the grocery store... just pick one with the coolest label.

I stole some avocado from my friend's turkey burger and I have to say it was a great idea.   I was disappointed by the sweet potato fries, they weren't too crispy and the flavor was very subtle, almost too subtle. I also didn't care for the sauce.

I wake up to a pounding headache and not feeling too hot as a whole..you know, when the thought of eating breakfast (eggs especially) makes you want to lose it. So, when my friend invited me to venture to Zinburger, I was excited. Not about moving...but about burgers.   While en route to the restaurant, my friend calls and tells me that they have a Bacon infused vodka bloody mary and if she wanted me to order one. Ummm...YES???? Liquid bacon plus vodka in the form of a bloody mary? Mommy daddy...yay!!!!!!   I arrive to this delicious beverage screaming my name, a sunny spot on the patio and just a prefect/fun atmosphere. The bloody mary alone was to die for. I had to refrain from eating the glass...  On to the food..burgers...and lots of them. Not to forget the sweet potato fries and other yummies. The burgers were great. Maybe only us people, who are completely obsessed with burgers, can truly appreciate a good burger. Others should opt for McDonalds.

    "text": "Zinburger is an interesting concept. I like the idea of an upscale burger joint coupled with a full bar. The look and feel of the place is casual and hip, with the clientele being mostly hipster/yuppies and business people. Although I am neither, I didn't feel entirely out of place. Maybe that was because of the friendly staff -- when people are nice and friendly to you, it always leaves a good, lasting impression. And, the one person that was utterly delightful and charming was the bartender.  I wish I remembered his name because I was quite smitten by him. His efficiency and friendliness only made the meal that much better.   And the meal, at least mine, was descent. I had the turkey burger, and being the seeker of great turkey burgers, I'd say this one was right in the middle.  For my taste, it needed a little bit more flavor to it. But what the turkey burger lacked, the sweet potato fries made up for.  You can't beat a flavorful sweet potato fry for anything! Despite my average feelings towards my meal, my mom truly enjoyed her BLT salad. It was the perfect side for her, and she said she really loved the salad dressing.   Zinburger has a lot of what I look for in a restaurant experience -- nice staff, cool atmosphere and good food.  If I could, I would give it 3 3/4 stars because it is definitely \"A-OK,\" but I'm not quite yet \"a fan.\" I'll definitely go back again and try some of their other offerings and decide then if I should up it a 1/4 point.  Heck, I may even pull out a fiver!",

    "text": "5 stars for stellar burger and fries!  I heard mixed reviews from several folks I know, about Zinburger.   As a result, I was hesitant to \"waste\" a rare opportunity to dine alone with my husband on a place that would be 'just OK'.  THEY WERE WRONG.  We got there on a bustling Friday night.  After being quickly seated, our very cute waiter (hey, i can look!) took our drink orders and swiftly fetched a few samples of beer when my dinner companion hesitated with his choice.   Good call!  We ordered some truffle fries immediately, as an appetizer and were they ever delicious!  Super hot, thin, crisp- just the way a fry should be.    We did dining role reversal- i ordered the beef, and he the salad.  I selected the \"Samburger\", subbing cheddar for the American cheese, and my husband selected the Seared Ahi Salad.    I had a little of the salad and it really was excellent.  The Ahi was cooked correctly  and the salad had a perfect balance of flavors.  But I came for a burger, not a salad- just sayin'.  The burger was sublime.  The bun was perfectly complementary, not a big blob of industrial bread.  The fixins were all fresh and delicious.  The bacon was thick and crisp, the beef was obviously fresh ground and hand-shaped, not packed into a brick by a machine.  I LOVE me a good burger, and I'd rather have a knockout $10 one every now and again than some mediocre pile of calories.  This burger was worthy.    Only because I love him did I let my husband have a little of the burger.  That was a mistake because he immediately developed Food Envy.  I had to guard my burger after allowing him that first taste.  I DID warn him, before he ordered his excellent salad, that this place specialized in BURGERS and that he would surely be sorry.  And he was.  DEFINITELY go to Zinburger. Savor a knockout burger and fries.   If you don't eat beef or are a disciplined dieter, you will enjoy the Ahi Salad.",

I like Sam Fox restaurants but I'm thinking this one needs an overhaul in management. No excuses for this lackluster staff.",

    "text": "We love Fox Concept, so much we go at least once a week to one of the many restaurants. Tonight I decided to take my sister here as she was craving a burger and had never been before. It was so embarrassing how awful the service was tonight.  We came in around 640 and put our name down for a table inside for 2, and were quoted a 10-15 min wait. We walked around to a few shops then made our way back to the restaurant where we waited another 15 minutes before I checked to see how much longer. When we got there, only two couples were waiting and now the entry was so crowded you could barely walk in but we noticed many people were getting seated inside. I told the hostess we had been waiting about 30 min and she was like I can sit you right now. So that was frustrating, were they even using the list to begin with? Not only that, but we got the table right in front of the kitchen. Like the only two top legit in front of the kitchen.   Next our server was very friendly, we ordered everything we wanted at that moment since we were pretty hungry at that point. We asked for two waters, Pinot noir, turkey burger bowl,the special which was the jalapeno burger and sweet potatoes fries. No kidding 10-15 min later we finally got our water, considering it was still 100 degrees out it would've been refreshing to get it sooner. Then we were waiting and waiting and finally he came back with the wine, nearly 20+ min after being seated, even apologizing that it took so long. He asked if we wanted our fries up first we said yes, however that never happened. After 30 min of being seated we got all our food, which was perfect. So although my sister left full and loved her burger(who doesn't love a burger smothered in cream cheese) it was not a great impression.   We noticed our server seemed to have some tables outside and maybe that wasn't a good assignment, or maybe the kitchen was overloaded because it was a Saturday night but it just wasn't the Fox Concept execution l normally experienced.",

I got the vegetarian burger which was great make out of quinoa and my husband got the Diablo burger. We got the truffle fries which was a large shareable size. Overall the food packed a little salt but they had some great sauces including a truffle aioli.   Would come back for dinner and get one of their refreshing drinks! I think this is a great date night spot, was parking and near the theater and shopping. They validate parking up to 2 hours which is super convenient.

The servers were very kind, but too busy to be very responsive (e.g., they forgot to bring a drink). The ambiance was nice--like a hip bar.  The hamburgers were really good. I had the vegetarian burger and found it filling and flavorful. We also ordered fries and requested they add garlic. The fries were good, but we could barely taste the garlic.   I would not go again. The food was good, but not good enough to fight the crowds. There are plenty of other burger joints in the area I would want to experience first. For ambiance, though, this place definitely has a good vibe. It would be a great place to meet friends after work.",

Their sweet potato hash is literally a sweet potato patty that's soggy and plain, completely not hashed.   The cookies and cream milkshake had so much milk in it, I could not enjoy it. It tasted like milk. I understand it's made with milk, but it should not taste solely of cow milk. Really gross. Not sweet like dessert, not tasty. Just milk. Gave me a stomach ache.   Never again.

The patties on this particular burger are thinner than the others, so I recommend making it a double, but overall -- really good.  Zinburger also lets you substitute the wagyu patty on any burger!

The bartender was nice and I enjoyed being able to watch tv or people watch. My burger was very tasty as were the fries. I do think that they are a bit over priced for what you get...but then again it's the Biltmore.",

We arrived last night with a large party (9) and my sister was asked if she was open to putting us in two booths to which she replied no.  They then told us the wait would be 25-35 min for an inside table.  I arrived a few min behind and was again asked if I was open to 2 booths; not knowing my sister had told them no; I explained that I was visiting my family and we'd prefer to all sit together.  About 10 min later, the hostess approached us and told us that the wait was actually 45 minutes or we could sit outside and wait 35 minutes.  I have small children with me and it was too cool to sit outside.  Needless to say, we did not stay and went to a new restaurant.",

They do have a great patio that overlooks the Biltmore, which always provides good people watching.  First, our food came out in weird order.  I split a Chinese chicken salad with someone and we also decided to split the zuchinni fries as well. We each ordered a burger, however the fries came out first, then the salad, then the burgers. Odd.  Who doesn't serve fries with a burger.  The chicken salad was pretty blah.  NOt a lot of flavor at all.  I didn't taste any hint of sesame, the base of Chinese anything, and it was a bit watery.  The zucchini fries were fantastic.  great crunch, not soggy at all, hot when served.  The burgers:  I ordered the Zinburger, the original.  It was fine, but nothing to write home about. I think for me it was the onions that threw me off. I love onions of all forms.  These were made in wine and I just didn't care for it, plus my burger needed some seasoning.  I did like the addition of the manchengo cheese. Yum.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  My friend got the turkey burger and I liked it better. I had more flavor to it by far. Interesting.    Our server was attention and engaging. Would I go back and pay $10 and up for a burger?  Probably not.",

The chicken was burnt. The burger buns were blah. And it tasted like a $1.00 (max) sandwich. Not $9.00. So not worth it. This is not a regular menu item and neither was the rest of their menu choices there. It was cheap, disgusting garbage burgers - worse than fast food restaurants. In fact, McDonald's $1.00 spicy McChicken is 10 times better. Wish Zin Burger actually served their normal gourmet burgers there.   On a positive side, I really do love their veggie burger, Kobe burger, ahi sandwich, zinburger, sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Every time I go there the ingredients are fresh, the \"meaty part\" is not burnt, the burger is made perfect and the burger buns are fluffy. Gourmet burgers!!  So if you never tried their place and tried it for the first time at the WM Open, trust me, it's def not the same!",

Joseph was our server and he was by far the best server I have had in a long time. He was friendly, available, and genuinely cared about our experience. One of our burgers came without avocado by accident and he immediately fixed the problem no questions asked. He promptly checked to make sure our food was up to our expectations shortly after taking our first bite. I will ask for him next time I come because he was so great and made for an amazing night. We also forgot our to go box and he tracked us down outside the restaurant to make sure we didn't go home empty handed. I will definitely be coming back to Zinburger.",

I was seated within a few minutes and then I sat there for a long time contemplating if I should just leave since no one was waiting on me. Yes I'm very impatient if you read my reviews but at the 12 minute mark if I don't know who my server is I'm ready to leave.  My waitress came over and grabbed my order finally.  My sweet potato fries came out and then a manager came over to apologize which really caught me off guard. I didn't complain I was just reading the news on my phone.  She explained the hostess made a mistake and there was a miscommunication on who was to wait on me.  She then told me my fries were on the house so that made them even sweeter.  Burger was outstanding when they say they are putting Franks red hot on the burger they don't lie.   After my meal I asked if I could get a Strawberry shake to go and then they comped that because they felt so bad about me having to wait.  Again I didn't complain not one single word so I was extremely impressed they recognized their error and wanted to fix it.  This was my second time dining at a Zine Burger and I hope to make it back to Arizona to dine here again.  The food is very high quality and they definitely care about the customer experience.",

Generally, I'm not a beef eater, but every once in a while I crave a burger. Today was that day. I could not have chosen a better spot. I went around 4ish, it wasn't busy, so I got a lot of attention from the bar staff. :-)   I like the indoor/outdoor bar. There is outside seating as well.  All of the staff was great. The facility was clean; and very trendy.   Four stars because I asked for no 1000 Island on my burger, but mustard and ketchup instead. The burger came with blue cheese, the bacon, burger, and the bun. I didn't complain, simply asked for ketchup and mustard and I added it to the burger. I will be back! :-)",

    "text": "These burgers pack a wallop. Seriously.  They are big, fresh, succulent, juicy, tender, and melt in your mouth, with the different textures of the toppings (depending on what you get) all perfectly complementing the meat.  Can't say enough about this place.. while there's something to be said about the bun (can get a little soggy on the bottom), this is definitely the best burger joint in the valley.  Get it medium-rare for the full tender experience, and an order of five guys-like fries (same lightness to it, but is crispier and fresher).  Plus a Sierra Nevada.  You won't regret it.  I do find myself occasionaly feeling a twang of guilt looking at the big happy cow in the field of greens on the back wall... but that instantly subsides after taking a bite out of a burger.",

Very accommodation and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I will most defiantly be coming back and bringing friends.",

I got the turkey burger and it was perfect, the texture, taste, everything, just incredible. My friend got the blanco burger and finished it in 5 minutes, never set it down once! Said it was the most amazing burger she has ever had! Our server was great, never waited for him and he was fun to chat with! Even got us to get dessert which we never do, the chocolate cream pie was a perfect end to our meal!!! I would absolutely suggest everyone try this place out if you love burgers :)",

    "text": "I took the kids to the Zinburger at the Biltmore today.  Our total bill was for $29.59.  I handed the server a gift card we won at a silent auction worth $25 and a $20 bill.  The server came back to me with $15.41 left on the gift card.  I wondered why he didn't take the money off the gift card first so that I could leave him a cash tip.  I left it alone, and figured we'd come back again and use the gift card.  So I asked him if I could use my Visa card to leave him a tip since he used the cash first instead of the gift card.  He asked his manager, and they said I couldn't use my Visa to leave a tip, but that I could give him what was left on my gift card as a tip.  I looked at him puzzled, what the hell?!?  That's a 50% tip!!!  I've never used a gift card to tip, EVER.  I always use cash to tip, and always over tip, especially for great service.  So instead of making my kids feel uncomfortable, I just gave him the card and left.  I've always enjoyed the Fox Concept restaurants, but I may not any longer.",

Most people find Zinburger while shopping at this upscale mall near Biltmore, so I recommend that they stop by for lunch.    When the weather cools off in the fall through spring,  the indoor-outdoor atmosphere where they open the wall between the two is really nice.  For those of you who are vegetarian or no-beef types, they have veggie, fish, chicken, and turkey meals.    Would have gotten 4 stars with a more diverse menu, but specializing on the burger fits a certain crowd and they seem to be doing well.",

We weren't quite full and had a gift card, so figured we would go share a burger. There was a bit of a wait, and the waitress informed us that it was a little bit of a CF in the kitchen that night, but it seemed alright to us. Anyway, we sat on the patio after waiting for 20 min or so and ordered the ringer burger and a bananas foster shake to split. Well, I was impressed, because they brought out both items split for us in separate glasses/plates. That's awesome! The ringer burger was very tasty, it was just a little spicy with the right amount of crunchiness....I would definitely get one of these again. The shake was ah mazing. I don't even typically like shakes, but the banana mixed with the caramel was to die for. I am not a huge fan of most Fox restaurants, but this one was a winner for me. Will be back!",

I visited Zinburger expecting a no frills good ole hangout and good food... We walked in around 8pm on Friday and were \"greeted\" by a young brunette girl, it was the first nice night out of the season so we asked for a seat outside- she said it would be a few minutes. That immediately questioned things because the outside was less than half seated. I ran all possibilities through my head as to why she couldn't seat us right away- giving her the benefit of the doubt, while my other half wasn't so happy. We waiting for five minutes while she scattered around the front room, she finally came back and said it will be a few minutes because there are no clean tables- the tables were clean and already wiped down all that was missing were the placings. But again I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but wait! there were 7 ( I counted) waitresses/ staff standing around the kitchen entrance talking and laughing, great! She asked us for our name after all the time we had already been there and put it in her iPad, she ran off again to the back and no one cleaned the tables. She finally returned and just kept \"checking\" parties into her iPad. It was awkward all of the people waiting behind us waiting to be seated that even one party said \" you obviously are moving in to many directions [to the hostess] can I just sit down and wait\" Eventually we asked if we could seat ourselves at the table we requested outside considering it was empty and we had been waiting for 10 + minutes, she insisted the table had to be cleaned so we waited and still not an unjust soul cleaned it. Another few minutes went by and I insisted I sit down outside. Eventually menus and silver ware were brought. I was sad to find out this was a Fox concepts Resturaunt.",

We went during lunch hour on a Friday and it was a busy little hive of activity. To sit inside was a 5-15 minute wait so we sat outside. We took the risk of being in the mid-afternoon sun and fighting off a few brave birds that lurked around because we were hungry. We ordered a basket of zucinni fires and the truffle fries. I loved both. Neither were too fried or drenched in batter, both had enough seasoning and deep-fried-ness to them that they were very enjoyable.   Everyone's food was great and received high remarks. I wasn't a fan of A burger without fries costing $11 bucks, but I understand its gormet and you're paying for the Max Taylor signature atmosphere too. All the wait staff were very pleasant and attentive.",

So, as you can imagine, I came here for lunch mid-week expecting burger decathalon greatness. Unfortunately, I came away feeling like I just won a participation meh-dal.   I ordered the Samburger - applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, 1000 island ressing, medium. The burger was good, and it was cooked to specification, but it wasn't fist-pumping, smoke-the-tires-off-the-Camaro-at-the-Dairy Queen awesome. (Bear with me ... this is the drivel you get when you fall asleep on the couch and the 120 Minutes drifts into a Bon Jovi VH-1 marathon. Damn it, I am just a vessel!)   I ordered the sweet potato fries (which are sold separately from the burger ... yep that's the sound of another Abe Lincoln being kicked out of your wallet's precious orbit ...). They were a major disappointment. Between the sins of blandness and sloth, I will take sloth for $500, Alex.  Where Zinburger shines is the Creme Brulee shake. Get it. Down it. Then get into your Bon Jovi edition Camaro and go into a gut heavy coma in the 120 degree heat. Even without the Camaro, it's that awesome.  Service was okay, but all in all, Zinburger is over-priced and underwhelming. If going to Zinburger is a requirement to get your last Cub Scout badge then get your caloric splurge on one of their shakes and go to town. Otherwise, save your money.",

    "text": "I think I'm kind of torn on this place. Strictly for the food, it's a good burger. I had the samburger (I think that's what it was called) cheese, bacon, lettuce, and thousand island dressing. It was cooked medium, just like I requested, and it was a good sized meal (I only ate half, and was full). The bun was a tasty wheat bread, and the meat was of great quality, good texture, and great flavor.   I also split an order of sweet potato fries, which were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd be interested to try the zucchini fries they have though.   The beer selection here is good, some non standards on tap, such as Left Hand Polestar Pilsner (which was a bit disappointing compared to some of LH's other offerings, but that's nothing against the restaurant) and one of my favorites, Deschutes Black Butte Porter. Pricing on the drinks was as expected for the upscale area, at $5.50/pint.   I do regret not trying the milkshakes, because they looked damn good, but quite frankly, I just can't eat that much. The menu is simple, but offers enough variety to keep in interesting. So far so good, right????   Well, here's where I become torn. The burgers are $10+, fries were extra at $6 (shared) and the beers were $5.50/pint. So, for two burgers, a split order of fries, two pints, tax, and tip, I spent over $60. Yes, it was good, but $60 for burgers and fries seems a bit steep, no matter how good. Not helping their cause, is Delux. If I remember correctly, the burgers at Delux were around $8, and were just as good, or maybe even better, fries were still shared, and their beer selection terrific! (selection is good, but it's all on tap, which scores big points in my book)   In the end, the magic adjective is \"good.\"  Zinburger is good. The service was good, helpful, and nice, and the place had a good ambiance and vibe. If it were a little less expensive and/or Delux didn't exist, this would be my go to burger joint in the area.",

    "text": "My husband and I did not enjoy our experience at Zinburger.  We wanted to sit outside.  They told us it would be a 15 minute wait to sit outside which I thought was odd because nearly half of the outside tables were open, and stayed open the entire time we were there.   We decided to sit inside.  The space is very cramped.  I felt like we were sitting on top of the people next to us.  The music was also insanely loud.  My husband and I practically had to scream at each other to hear each other.   Our waiter was nice enough but he seemed distracted.  The table next to us tried to grab his attention while he was taking our order, he stopped and turned to them and talked to them for at least 2 minutes before turning back to us.  I thought it was incredibly rude!  He should have told them he'd be with them in a minute instead of cutting us off.  He also never checked on us while we were eating to make sure everything was ok.  On to the food!  It was extremely underwhelming.  My husband got the burger special for the evening; it was a south west kind of burger with chipotle mayo and peppers.  There was no spice to it at all, and it was medium rare instead of medium well which is how my husband ordered it.  He also said it was really greasy.  I got the Zinburger with a grilled chicken breast instead of meat.  It was average, something I'd expect to get in a diner.  I was excited to try it since Manchego cheese is my favorite but I could barely taste it, the onions overpowered it.  We also got a side of sweet potato fries which were limp and soggy, and coleslaw which was average.    I can't say no to banana cream pie, it's my favorite so I got that and my husband got a 50/50 (orange soda and vanilla ice cream.)  The pie was good, but the entire time we were eating dessert there was this awful burnt garlic smell assaulting my nose.  That kind of ruined it.  My husband didn't enjoy his 50/50.  All of that plus a soda and a drink with alcohol came out to $53.  We won't be back!",

    "text": "Visited Zinburger for the first time on New Years eve and was happy to find that it was open. I have lived in the area for about 3 years now and have been wanting to try it out for a while.   The inside of Zinburger is modern and clean lined. You can feel that they care about beef. I mean they have huge cows on the wall, they must care about it! The only thing that was missing in that picture was a couple of UFOs.   They had a hamburger on the menu called the Zinburger. I had to try it since the name of the place was Zinburger, so it must be their signature hamburger. It was 1/2 pound of hamburger with grilled onions on top. I was kind of skeptical of the grilled onion combination because I've grown up with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard hamburgers. I rarely eat hamburgers anymore because let's be honest, there is a lot of shitty burgers out there and it is hard to find a good one. There really is a science to cooking the meat right and I think a lot of grillmasters foul it up. The burger I got was cooked perfectly and I was also pleased with the bun they used on the burger. This wasn't just some soggy bun you'd buy off the grocery store shelf. It was so much better than that! It was hands down the best hamburger bun I've ever tasted. I bet they make the bread in house which just shows the extent they go to make a quality burger.   We also had the sweet potato fries. This is the third place I've been to in Phoenix that has had em. The dip that the sweet potato fries come with really make them taste good.   I went to Zinburger and I wanted a REAL burger and I was not disappointed. Next time I go I want to try their shakes which I have since heard are really good.",

I believe that I ordered the zinburger and I was impressed by how you could customize what you ordered.  They had plenty of cheeses and toppings that you could add or switch out with whatever was on the menu.  Also, if you do go here, order the zucchini fries!  They were amazing - perfect amount of batter/breading (just enough but in no way overwhelming the zucchini) and topped with some parmesan.  It is a little pricey - over $10 for the entree- but every now and then you should treat yourself.",

The truffle fries are good and so were the couple of reds that I tried. One was a syrah and k forget the other. I will be back again but for 5 stars they could give a 1/2 order of fries for $2 instead of being straight ala carte.",

    "text": "After my experience at The Grind yesterday, I wasn't so sure I could handle another burger place today, but my coworkers wanted to check it out so I went along for the ride. I am so glad that I did!   The space is bright, cheery and airy, and on a nice day the patio is perfect setting to eat a meal. While not overflowing with options, the menu did at least have more choices than The Grind. I was excited to see a turkey burger, veggie burger and seared ahi burger alongside the beef choices.   We decided to start with some fries, which do all come a la carte, but they were really good! My favorite were the Zucchini fries, not I might be biased just because I love zucchini, but they were so good! They weren't really all that crispy, but the coating was seasoned right and they had some homemade ranch on the side for dipping. The sweet potato fries were also really good, sliced really thin and served with a yogurt dipping sauce that gave them a Middle Eastern feel. The regular fries were also really tasty, sprinkled with herbs and Parmesan cheese and served with a truffle aioli!   I ordered the Turkey burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, lettuce and mayo. I had been wanting a turkey burger since last week, so I had high hopes for this, and well, my expectations were not only met but exceeded! The turkey was juicy, seasoned well and the combination of the cheese and the generous amount of avocado made it just perfect! They make the buns fresh with a combination of white and wheat flour, and wow, they are so fresh and delicious!   The others in my group had the Zinburger and the Plain and Simple burger, both of them really liked them, saying the meat had good flavor and was cooked well. One of the girls had the Chinese chicken salad and also thought that it was really good.   They also have a menu full of milk shakes as well as chocolate cream and banana cream pie! We were stuffed and didn't get to sample any of the sweets, but I will try to on my next visit.   There is a lot of burger competition along Camelback right now, and while a bit on the pricey side ($10) per burger, the freshness and service really make it worthwhile. This is my new favorite burger place!",

    "text": "I first experienced Zinburger in Tucson, of all places, and I loved it. I went as often as I could when I was in town. It was hands down my favorite place to eat in Tucson, and I was itching for it to move to Phoenix.  On my first visit to Zinburger, my vision of the perfect burger meal shattered. The place itself is wonderfully stylized and the staff are perky (but new), but the food was disappointing. On my first visit, I had a glass of Reisling, and the Zinburger, and my favorite truffle fries. The Zinburger was greasy and the bun was soggy when it came out, and the fries weren't as tasty as I remember them being in Tucson. But since I loved Zin so much, I wanted to give it a second chance.  I met up with a friend for happy hour (wait, no happy hour at a burger and \"wine\" bar?!) and tried to play it safe with the Plain and Simple burger. The fries were tastier this time, and the server was happy to split the Bananas Foster shake (which was very yum) but the burger just did not deliver. It wasn't soggy this time, but rather... normal. Nothing special. I might as well have been at Denny's.  The staff, on the other hand, seemed very knowledgeable and friendly, but that doesn't change the disappointing food.  I will probably give Zin ONE MORE CHANCE.... I just can't get over how heartbreaking the food is compared to the Tucson one. But I'm not about to drive 2 hours just for a burger!",

Funny thing, either my wife was extremely hungry or it was the best hamburger of her life. You have to understand my wife, she takes her time when she eats, savors the moment, and enjoys it from start to finish. Well needless to say before I was half way done with my burger, she had completed hers. I felt like I was in the twilight zone or something, that just doesnt happen her finishing before me!  I found the hamburger to be the 'right size'. It wasnt too  big, not too small. I felt comfortably full after everything.  The creme brulee shake was very good. I could only get through about 3/4 of it. I definately will be visiting it again. Nice trick with the mirror giving the illusion of the place is bigger than it seems. Took me a minute to figure out it was a mirror, and not part of the restaurant.",

It was easily an inch and half thick, seared perfectly with plenty of avocado slices to make it the best fish sandwich I have ever had!

    "text": "I really want to rate Zinburger a 3.5, with the potential to improve to a 4, but I'll go with the 3.  The good: -My Kobe burger was really good. -My wife's salad with chicken was good. -I like the way the windows and open area by the bar frame the Esplanade - I felt like I was in a big city (big meaning dense, not big meaning sprawling). -Nice casual atmosphere.  The bad: -Some uncomfortable \"we just opened last night so this is my second day on the job\" moments with the staff.  They were friendly but it felt forced (maybe 'cuz the boss was in the house?) - I thought the three high-school age hostesses were going to gang-tackle me and physically throw me into a booth, all in the name of good service.  I'm sure in time this will work itself out. -My really good Kobe burger was $14, with no sides.  And my beer was $7.  Add $6 for fries or a side salad and your hamburger dinner just cost $34. -The zucchini fries were awful - this is probably a matter of personal taste, and not reflective of the quality of Zinburger. -The sweet potato fries were OK - I've yet to have a sweet potato fry I enjoy as much as a Delux sweet potato fry.  I didn't have the guts to try the bacon bloody mary.  I don't like bloody mary's, but ... bacon... mmmmm.  So, all in all, not bad.  But, if I was going to have one burger and sweet potato fries dinner before I died, it would be at a wonderful little place a mile and a half east on Camelback.  Luckily my situation is not that dire and I can still enjoy a meal at Zinburger.",

The kid's burger was huge and it came with fries. We also ordered the sweet potato fries. The people around us had milkshakes and they looked delicious. I also noticed fried zucchini and figure next time I'll order those instead of fries.   We were in a rush and had something at 6 pm. We told the waiter we were in a hurry. He was great, friendly and accommodating. We were seated next to the hostess stand and my daughter kept trying to engage the folks standing there. Everyone was so nice.   My constructive feedback would be that I ordered my burger medium well and I received it medium rare. It still tasted yummy and I ate it. Had it been served that way to my hubby - he would not have been able to stomach the red juice flowing from the burger.",

    "text": "Sorry Zinburger but Deluxe still makes a better burger; I'm giving you 2.5 stars for now, but I'll give it another shot in a few months.  I think you need some time to work out the kinks.  Rating Breakdown:  Atmosphere:  3.5 Stars, Typical FoxRC, clean good aesthetics with a well defined style.  The trendy airy bar feel is nice, but the music is blaring way too loud (reminiscent of AZ88).  The patio seating is quieter and provides for good people watching.  Food: 2 Stars, Inconsistent and lacking flavor.  Opening week problems?  Maybe... Hopefully the food will be better on my next visit.  ** ZinBurger: Came out cooked to a perfect medium rare, very impressed.  The meaty flavor was good - the bun was boring.  Nothing exceptional. $10  ** Kobe Burger: Ordered medium rare, came out rare.  Kobe tartar!  Gross! Even if this burger was cooked properly I doubt that it would have been worth $14.  Cheddar cheese and mushrooms... snooze!  I thought this was a fancy burger shop?  ** Buffalo Chicken Sandwich:  This was the best part of our meal.  Flavorful and satisfying, but really how hard is it to cook a chicken breast and toss it in hot wing sauce?  I'm pretty sure I would be just as happy ordering the same item from Chilli's or Applebees. $10  ** Double Truffle Fries:  Soggy, oily, and over salted.  Yuck!  The truffle oil flavor was there and the fries had potential, but I just couldn't get past the soggy oily salty mess. $6  ** Zucchini Fries:  These are just fried zucchini cut into a steak fry shape instead of the normal zucchini rounds.   Nothing special, in fact I think I prefer the fried zucchini from Carl's Jr.  $6  Drinks: 3 Stars, Full bar, eight beers on tap and eight additional bottled selections.  *** A little rant:  If I'm going to dine in a place that is charging me $25 for a burger, fries, & a beer I would expect filtered water at the table.  Sorry, but at this price point City of Phoenix tap water, that tastes like it came from my backyard pool, just doesn't cut it!  Service: 2 Stars, Lots of waitresses running around frantically, but ours seemed to be MIA for most of the meal.  Conclusion:  Save your money and time.  Run up to Deluxe instead, or better yet skip the trendy and head over to Two Hippies for a great burger, fries, and a Shasta drink for $5.",

Their menu is a very simple menu, along with their burgers, they offered salads as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the Kobe Beef burger and the Zinburger. The burgers don't come with fries, so we ordered the sweet potato fries with a yogurt dipping sauce. Our burgers were so juicy and full of flavor, I felt guilty for trying to eat the whole thing. But I ended up stopping myself half way through my burger just so I can enjoy their Creme Brulee milkshake, and let me tell you, it was well worth it!  Overall, I think it's a place you should definitely try when you're looking for a good gourmet burger. It was nice and quiet during the time we were there. It would be a great place to take your family.",

Their burgers are flavorful and fresh, the sweet potato fries completely scrumptious, and the potions are generous.  I have tried their Buffalo Chicken sandwich as well as the Plain & Simple Burger.  Both have been more than I can consume, especially with sharing the fries.  I have also heard that the zucchini fries are like a meal within itself and look forward to trying them next time I visit.  We went their for lunch and let me just say that the people watching here is rather amusing... watching an elderly lady eat a burger with a knife and fork and adding ketchup to it with her knife for each individual bite in which she cut away one at a time, was much more refined than I have ever seen anyone consume a burger.  The staff was friendly and attentive despite how occupied it was and tended to our needs accordingly. I look forward to going back sometime soon!",

    "text": "Ok so I have to admit, I was actually headed to Sam's Cafe to meet a friend for dinner but realized it was closed once we arrived! So, we decided to walk over and try out Zinburger. Let me say that I'm so glad we did!   The menu here is pretty limited but I suppose one should expect that when the name of the restaurant specifically refers to \"burgers\". The good news here is that, in addition to some unique burger options, they also cater to the non-cow eating clientele and offer up tuna, chicken, turkey and a veggie option.   The burgers come a la cart which means you have to fork a few extra bucks for the fries. There's a cool selection of shakes to choose from and, as our various servers explained (no joke! we had at least 3 young girsl attending to our table!), they also have a burger and a shake \"of the month\". This month's shake happens to be called the date shake. I assume they've spent some time in Dateland, Az copying a recipe... I didn't order a shake on this trip but by looking around at everyone else's table, I think I'm going to have to next time because they did look great!  As for the food... the fries (both the traditional and sweet potato) were hot, crispy and flavorful. They serve them with some unique sauces that were also very good. The burgers were large, meaning the patty was very thick! They are cooked to order and they got ours spot on!   The atmosphere in this place was relaxed, somewhat retro, airy and cool. There are two patio sections, however, we opted to take the first available table so we sat inside. Either way, there was some good people watching and it was enjoyable!",

I always passed by Zinburger but didn't think to go there for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices weren't too pricey, and the food was really great.  We ordered the Snickers shake to split, amazing! I think it may be only for the summer so hurry in and get one because it was delish! Truffle fries with dipping sauce were really great to share.  I got the turkey burger (next time no mayo) and traded the swiss for pepper jack. My friend got the Kobe burger, said it was fantastic. Service was good, fast turn around on the food/shake.  Overall good meal, and I will return!",

I've had other gourmet burgers that were good too but, I especially like the bread bun on Zinburgers.  I was also a fan of the truffle fries... they didn't need the aoli they came with!  I don't really order sweets often but I ordered a shake too because the server was awesome enough to split it into 3 glasses for everyone at the table.   The restaurant also had a cool, trendy atmosphere which was very clean.  Our server was very polite and efficient... though the kitchen did add sauce that I ask to be substituted (it was good anyway).    So why only 4 stars?  Well, it was a very expensive lunch.  3 burgers, a shake, 2 teas, and 1 fry came to almost $60.  Be prepared!  I'd still go back but, it'll be a rare treat!  See ya there!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I never heard of this place previously and just happened to walk by and try it. Without having any expectations, it's True what people say, the burgers are good, but the price you pay for what you get really isn't worth it.   With \"burger\" in the restaurant name, I was expecting a multitude of burgers to choose from, but there are a limited amount of burgers listed on the menu. The burgers range from $9-$14 and with a higher price, you'd think you'd get a side of fries or something, however, you only pay for the burger.   I was surprised when the burgers came out with no sides included so my boyfriend and I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. They were decent, but for $5, the \"basket\" seemed more like a handful. We also ordered the Peach Cobbler Shake of the month and weren't really blown away...it was just vanilla ice cream with peaches on top.  Finally, Zinburger keeps the doors open. It makes the restaurant seem more breathable which makes sense because their interior is simple with fresh colors, but leaving the doors open means flies come in. My boyfriend and I were constantly swatting flies away from our food when we sat down, when we were eating, and when we were signing the check.   Overall, I've had better. For two people, we spent $45. The food is good, but definitely not worth the money and fly-filled atmosphere.",

Not sure when they switched up the menu to feature the grass-fed beef instead of Kobe, but as a Kobe-fan I wish they would go back.  For me, the Kobe is what set Zinburger apart of other more upscale burger eateries for me.  The Strauss grass-fed beef was okay per my palate (medium rare cooked), but lacking that melt-in-your-mouth, free-of-gristle Kobe experience I consistently got every time I ate there.    Aside from that, Truffle Fries are a must, service has always been excellent for me.  Not sure I'll make the out-of-the-way trip on my own volition in the future, however.",

Their happy hour goes until 6pm (I think) where wine is $2!!! and appetizers are half off. Unfortunately none of their speciality burgers are on the happy hour menu. :( They do have a regular burger on their HH menu though.   Their sweet potato fries & Truffle Fries were really delicious. I wasn't a fan of their dipping sauces..... I guess I'm just a ketchup-kind-of-gal. I ordered a Creme Brulee shake (which can definitely be shared since it's a lot) which is basically vanilla bean ice cream and a crust mixed in. It was so yummy. (But again, this wasn't available for their HH menu either )  It was a little chilly when we went, but they have an outside patio which would be great on a warm night.",

I asked for medium and medium should have a titch of pink. This burger was medium well +. Not as dry as could have been given the overdone ness. Probably because it was quality meat. I had the zinburger and it was very flavorful and the bun was really good. Typically buns are uneventful and can be tough or dry. This one fresh and tasty  I sat at the bar and server attentive and when I ordered she said salad would be right out. I don't think 20 minutes constitutes right out. But it's a fun place to people watch so I didn't mind the delay. But don't tell me \"salad will be right out\" if it won't be.  I am in phoenix on business so probably won't return anytime soon. But if I do, I'd come back. The menu has a lot of good options.  I had a hard time deciding",

Service has been quite good every time I've been here too, besides one instance of the bar tender letting my to-go order sit forever at the kitchen window.  Parking Tip: I recommend the free parking garage behind Saks/Macy's, but they do validate the Camelback-facing front lot parking here too.  The breakfast burger is my go-to here.  The runny egg yolk is really what makes it, especially when a perfect bite encompassing sweet bun, medium burger, crunchy bacon, and gooey cheese is dipped in ketchup.  I did NOT like their veggie burger, it was extremely \"chunky\" and the texture was just all wrong.  I think I've tried their turkey burger once but I cannot remember it honestly.  The creme brulee shake wasn't on the menu when I last visited, but it's really good.  The little \"crunches\" on top are the best.  Chocolate Mint and Cookies & Cream are also both excellent.  Their fries are good too, but I usually just get a burger and sometimes a milkshake.",

I ordered the loaded fires and they were pretty good. The only complaint about the fries is that they had too much of their cheese sauce. For the burger I decided to go with their burger of the week, \"Patty Melt burger\". It came on a rye sandwich bread, with coleslaw, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese, and thousand island dressing. The burger wasn't terribly bad, just nothing amazing. The bread under the burger was soggy and falling apart, and the burger itself seemed extremely under seasoned. I wouldn't recommend that particular burger, but I felt like they had the potential to make extremely tasty burgers. Excited to try again!",

Burgers came and it was the weirdest mash-up of the burgers we ordered, which were straight off the menu. They took the burgers back to the kitchen and \"fixed\" them. As a \"gift\" they were going to give us more fries that came about 10 minutes after we finished our burgers. I'd give it another try, hoping it was an off night because the food really was fantastic.   Came back to Phoenix and gave it another try! Everything was excellent. Must've been an off night last year?",

Our waiter checked on us often but not to often. They got our order right and asked us when we wanted everything to be served. They packed up our food and got us our check and we were on our way happy and content.  The food was OMG so delicious. The milkshake was to die for. Seriously, I got the cookies and cream and It actually had the little chunks of cookie and it wasn't to thick or too thin. The loaded fries were heaven on a plate. They had this delicious cheese sauce on top with chives, sour cream, and bacon on top. The zucchini fries were a whole other kind of delicious. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. SO GOOD!!!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves burgers!!!",

    "text": "Zinburger has great tasting burgers, shakes and fries. I don't know how long ago they changed their menu, but they removed some of their specialty burgers--most notably a breakfast one that had bacon and a grilled egg. Even without those specialty burgers, they still have a solid selection, and if you want that grilled egg (like I did), you can build your own burger and recreate some of the burgers that they used to have.   Any burger that you get here is cooked to order, and it's always juicy and filled with flavor. You can get different types of fries ranging from normal fries to double truffle fries (my personal favorite). On top of that they have a large selection of shakes-- my favorite being the Nutella crunch!   The atmosphere here is loud and pretty busy. Unless you reserve a table, you're most likely going to have a wait during dinner time. They have some indoor seating, a full bar, and more seats outdoor as well.   If you're looking for a good tasting burger, you can't go wrong here.",

I was told how much it was but he couldn't figure out how to do it.  After a long whole the manager told me it couldn't be done-that the burger recipes could not be changed in any way.   Ok-doesn't make sense to have a price for adding bacon then.  Felt like it was a dust off and the attitude behind the whole experience was what really disappointed me.    I fly often through Phoenix.  There are lots of other choices so not sure if I'll go back.",

For $9 you get a 3.5 burger with no fries or a drink! 3.5 oz! To put that in perspective you get a 8oz burger from fuddruckers for $7, a better quality burger, for $9.99 you get a 1/2lb exotic burger. The burgers are still good but dont justify the price, if you want to go on a cool hangout and have no budget i recommend this place, if you are hungry and dont want to spend a ton of money to not get what you would at another burger place i wouldn't recommend.  Update I ordered the chicken sandwich and it is the thinnest chicken sandwich ive ever ate! Comparable to chick-filet, i dont work for fuddruckers but i eat there atleast 2 times a week, and the buffalo chicken sandwich is double the size and better quality. I attached a pic to show how thin it is, im so disappointed! I dont think i will eat here again",

We were a large group and it happens, but they did a GREAT job getting us sat and everyone had water by 6:31! They did a great job. I don't think I can stress that enough. The wait staff was friendly and promt without being overbearing. They joked around with us and made the experience that much more memorable.

I am usually the type of girl who prefers throwing down with a hearty In N Out or Five Guys burger BUT I do appreciate the fancy stuff every now and then...burgers included.  So if you're down with that then give this place a try. They have some great burger combinations on the menu plus you can add on other goodies like a fried egg. Yum! I also tried the ahi sandwich and was pretty pleased. I mean, I finished the whole darn thing so I can only assume that I enjoyed it.   Our table taste tested the zuchini fries, truffle fries and sweet potato fries. All winners but my favorite were the truffle fries. I'd go back just for those papas fritas.  Service was good. No problems at all...even when I requested to change tables simply because I changed my mind and preferred a booth. Food came out quickly and the atmosphere is young and trendy.

The Biltmre is a great place to people watch. Doing it while enjoying delicious food is worthy of 5 stars. The food is expensive. You can expect to spend $30 per person for a burger, fries and non alcoholic drink plus tip. But you really will get what you pay for.",

I just went again this past week and I didn't love it as much.  The burger was good and the fries were okay, but it wasn't as great as during Restaurant Week.  The service was just okay as well.  My daughters order chicken fingers and a grilled cheese.  Both were bad.  I had the Zinburger, which I really like.  I also order just the normal fries, which were just okay.  I won't be rushing to come back any time soon.",

The quality of the burger seemed fine, although for $10, fine doesn't seem to be enough. The regular French Fries were nice and crisp. The taste of the Burger doesn't come close to The Grind which I rate to be #1, followed closely by Deluxe. There wasn't that beefy goodness and charbroiled taste to this burger  I wanted to like this expensive burger as the location is terrific and the service, even on a slow afternoon, was quite wonderful. Unfortunately, it neither lived up to expectations or to its competitiors.   If I am going to \"splurge\" on a Burger it is going to have to be The Grind or Delux \"after hours.\"",

It's always nice when you don't have to yell across the table.   Our waiter took our orders quickly - Kobe Beef Burgers and truffle fries. I know, they're $14.00 burgers and it's just ground beef. But they're so perfect.  It took about 15 mins to get our food. The burgers were delicious, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness. The fries, not so much. They tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. But the burgers filled us up so I wasn't too interested in the fries.   Overall, great food and quick service. Can't ask for much more.",

    "text": "Now that I've explained that Hop Doddy is so BADLY AVERAGE, let me tell you what is  NOT badly average: ZIN BURGER!  I've had a long time coming around to Sam Foxes restaurants and to be honest with you, I don't know why.  \"North\" is terrific, their Italian restaurant and any of their North locations and Zin Burger is just a terrific burger.  ABSOULTELY TERRIFIC.  I've said before in other reviews, when I first go to a burger joint, I get a standard burger.  It's like the marinara at an Italian restaurant; it speaks volumes.  If I taste the spaghetti sauce at an Italian restaurant, and it tastes like Chef Boyardee, there's no reason to try the rest of the menu.  An Italian friend of mine used to say, \"How's the gravy?\", and he wasn't talking brown gravy.  So, my first time at Zin, I got the basic burger, the Samburger: applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, lettuce and 1000 Island.  I can't say it any other way or stronger: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!    Say it again: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!    Because this burger was...IS so good! I have no idea about the flavors of the other burgers.  Never had 'em.  Never ordered anything other than the Samburger.  Why would I?  I found a great burger.  I have to assume they're just as good, in their own way, in their own flavor.  Looking at the menu just now, I've noticed an Angus Beef Sloppy Joe...I could try that!  I could probably be talked into their Bleu Cheese Burger...but then I wouldn't have a Samsburger...  And just so you don't think from my sub-standard review of Hop Doddy, that price is most important, it isn't; this burger, even with the bacon already on it, is $2 too much...and, by God, it's worth it!  I find the staff's at both Biltmore/Chandler to be very friendly, well-trained (except for the waitress at Chandler who said, and I'm quoting, \"...you cannot get e-coli at Zin because we grind out own beef\".  Sorry, baby.  That's got nothing to do with e-coli.)  Almost forgot: the fries.  Let me just say this: I like regular fries and not for $6 or $7 bucks.  The standard fries here are excellent, $5.  Save the room, eat the half your dining companion couldn'f fidn  I've said it before and I'll say it again: Zin Burger, Freddy's, Lucky Boy.  Best burgers!",

Last time we tried zinburger was a double date- we ordered truffle fries and sweet potato fries for the table.  The boys had beer which zinburger had some nice options on tap.  For food my date and I decided to share the farm salad which really was quite good!  The burger we shared was a spicy one diablo?  We ordered it medium which it was cooked properly with a chipotle aioli and jack cheese.  There was too much runny sauce all over the burger but it tasted great.  Next time I want to try a milkshake- they have several gourmet options!",

It wasn't that busy so we sat and ordered a couple drinks - however the bartender seemed either flustered or tired and forgot my bloody at first. No biggie cause it was good. Comes with some bacon too!  The menu is pretty straight forward and simple however the options are so good its hard to decide. We were originally going to get the zucchini fries to share, but decided since sides don't come with the burger, we would get them as a side and get onion rings as well.   I had the Samburger - which was delicious. The meat could have used a slight more seasoning, but I have a feeling they backed off because of the bacon which is OK because it was pretty salty and took care of that element - but if I didn't have the bacon, it would have needed more (there were plenty of bites with out bacon). Hubs had the turkey sloppy Joe which was just an awesome version of comfort food. They serve theirs with cheese and a pablano to fancy it up - but they totally could have just given you a bowl of it and it would have been amazing.  All around - ok service with great food. Both of us commented that it must have been an off day for the server because he also forgot the extra pickles I asked for - and the service wasn't typical of the Fox Restaurants.   Will definitely have to go back and try some of the other menu items because we actually had a really hard time deciding on what we had!",

Overall the burger had a very nice balance of meat to egg to cheese to bacon. What more can I hungry guy ask for? The truffle fries were very tasty as well and a good portion for 2 people to share.

We also had the diablo burgers, which were definitely spicy, but the jalapenos added a nice flavor to the burgers. The buns were fluffy and sweet, but very filling (I only ate the bottom bun).  For dessert, we had the cookies and cream shake. You can never go wrong with oreo milkshakes, and this one was no exception! They had crunchy oreos blended into the ice cream, and light whipped cream on top -- YUM!   Overall, Zinburger is a great place to grab a burger and shake and people watch in the Biltmore!

The fries were good but a little soggy, not sure if it was the truffle oil that made it soggy.  Nutella milk shake had a good mix of chocolate, hazelnut and toffee flavor, only suggestion would be that they provide a bigger straw becuase the toffee bits clog up the thin straws.

The fries and onion rings were  soggy. And my berry cocktail was bitter!   Then after we began eating, a large table of 5 adults 2little boys and a baby were seated next to us. The adults sat together and they sat their extremely hyperactive kids together and even the baby at the very end  next to our table.     Thanks!!   One of the little boys was really misbehaving, running up and down the aisles between our tables from the get- go, fork fighting, dropping things under OUR table, etc. while his parents sat oblivious to the disruptions, enjoying each others company .   It made our mediocre dining experience ultimately worse! Our waiter was inattentive as well.  Although the menus seemed similar, we thought the burgers, fries, and service were much better during our visit to Hopdoddy a few days earlier!!",

Second, when I went to pay I realized that I made a big mistake - I left my wallet at home. I was embarrassed because I knew my date didn't have her purse. I actually told her to just leave it at my place.   I was trying to see if I could just run home real quick and call in my debit card, or even go back and pay. I told the manager of my mistake and she literally said, \"this happens to all of us, don't worry, I'll come the meal.\"  I have been back twice since then and I brought my card each time.",

They have good craft beers on draft as well to accompany your burger.   They definitely lost a star due to service. We were seated and had to wait about 15 minutes for a server to come by- luckily the hostess noticed us and alerted the staff- because of that we were given a complimentary order of fries, which we appreciated! The fries were excellent and a great addition to your burger.   We would come back to this burger spot!",

But really when you're looking at the list, you could honestly go with a different one each time and probably leave with a smile.   The Zin burger is just your good old traditional burger that has a bursting flavor in one patty with melted Manchengo cheese and Zinfandel braised onions to compliment. You just can't go wrong with it.   The Waygu (American Kobe) burger....wow! Now if you thought your Zin burger was awesome, the Waygu burger will knock your taste buds out of the park. Something about it just makes it a yum yum in my book.  I think the caramelized onions, wild mushroom, lettuce, and melted cheddar cheese helped.  It comes with a soft pillowy set of buns - *pat pat*, pickle spear and tomato slices on the side.   I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. So I know service here is important.   The serving size is big enough for me - bigger than your average sized fast food burger.",

Doesn't come with any side though, which kinda sucks :( but you can order the sweet potato fries as an appetizer/side, which was delish.   Topped everything off with a salted caramel milkshake! It was a happy and delicious meal!  Our server was also super nice. Gave just enough time before we ordered, everything came correctly and timely, and accommodated to our requests.

They have it sectioned of with raised planters and of course, misters.   I ordered a nutella milkshake and an el diablo burger. I will always be disappointed that the burgers don't come with fries and that you need to pay more for fries. Potatoes are cheap, so please include the fries.   Anyways, the milkshake is a good size and they are thick. The whipped cream is obviously house whipped and is delicious. The milkshake itself was amazing. It had a slightly mellowed down nutella flavor with bits of something crunchy in there. I would have ordered 2 if I didn't know better about the sugar content.   The el diablo burger came with carmelized onions, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo,  and roasted jalapenos. At other restaurants, when I have ordered their \"spicy\" burger it has never been spicy at all. This burger actually had a little kick to it, which I love. I always wish things were spicier but then more people wouldn't be able to eat it so I get it. The server informed me before ordering that they cook their burgers a little under. I didn't specify my burger to be cooked more or left the way they cook it when I order but it came out perfect so whatever happened, it happened nicely. I would definitely order this burger again.",

    "text": "Zinburger gained a new fan and is another hit in my book from Fox restaurants.  My BFF was eager to use her FRC gift card she received earlier in the year and we settled on here as we were already in the area.  Along with my 2 children, we were a party of 4 when we entered on a late Saturday afternoon.  To my relief, it was not busy and our hostess greeted us quickly.  She pulled out 2 small magnetic doodle toys for my kids to play with and it was such a neat surprise.  Our server was pleasant overall but I felt like she was in a rush and uninterested at times.  She completed all of our requests without issue so I can't complain too much.  We ordered a lot of food - onion rings, zucchini fries, half order regular fries, and truffle fries for apps.  Bruce Lee burger for myself and the Wagyu burger for BFF.  They do have 4 different kids meals but I knew my kids would like the appetizer variety more.  The zucchini fries were my least favorite.  I don't know what it was about it but I couldn't eat more than a few pieces.  Everything else was delicious, especially the truffle fries.  It was so addicting!  The Bruce Lee burger has a noticeable kick to it as evident by the sriracha mayo and jalapenos used.  I eaten many different varieties of burgers over my lifetime and wanted to try something I haven't experienced before.  This did not disappoint.  I don't know what my BFF's Wagyu burger tasted like other than \"good\" from her words but I saw that it was slightly bigger in size than my burger.  She also commented that the texture was a little different from an ordinary burger as well but this was not meant as a negative critique.  I'm happy to add this to my guilty pleasures list and look forward to returning!",

Since I was not incredibly hungry, my boyfriend and I shared the Bruce Lee burger and zucchini fries.  The burger was delicious. The Asian BBQ sauce and sriracha mayo created a creamy, tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy concoction. The cabbage slaw, avocado, and jalapeno gave the burger a great freshness as well. Overall, it was great, but a little pricey at $11.50. The zucchini fries are one of my favorite things at this restaurant. They are crunchy but perfectly cooked through and served with a little Parmesan on top and ranch on the side. I will be back to try some other options, but if you are going to stop by, be prepared to spend more money than you would expect.",

I'm not a regular but have been here enough times when I want a good gourmet burger. Today was a bit disappointing because my burger was not as good as I expected. The patty itself was good but the bun was excessively and DRY. If it had been good bread I would have enjoyed it took away from the burger in my opinion.  Overall was OK but nothing great. Don't know if I will be coming back.",

We recommend the truffle fries, they're our absolute favorite! We are from Tucson, and we love Zinburger here, but the patio at this location is absolutely fantastic! We love that the patio seating is right next to the splash pad, so the kids can play. 5/5 will recommend to friends and family. We will also be returning the next time we are in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Situated snug in the middle of the Biltmore Fashion Park, Zinburger has become the spot for fun, hip, milkshake and burger eating delights. While I've been there four times now (once just for the Black Lager Float) I have to say that every trip has led to a very delicious experience.   Last night's order: Samburger with a fried egg. So I've had this burger  before, but without the egg... let me just say, I don't think I can order this sandwich without the egg anymore.. it made it that much better.  But that's just me. I'm into eggy things (almost as much as I'm into smoked meats and cheeses.. but I'll save that for another day.. BTW.. is there a Salumi place anywhere in Phoenix?)  Side wise, I've had the regular fries, the truffle fries, the sweet potato fries, and the zucchini fries... all very good and seasoned well. To make your meal more interactive and fun.. get your fries as a semi-appetizer that lingers around just long enough to say 'Hi' to the burgers as they come out. Otherwise.. you'll be waiting around while your beef gets cooked up.  If I had to give one negative remark, it would have to be regarding the wine selection. For a joint that actively says.. \"Hey.. we do burgers and wine\"... I'd have to say the job of Zinburger's sommelier is rather dull. Would you like to spend 5 bucks.. or 7 bucks? (I'm partly exaggerating)  Overall, the burgers are good, the fries are good.. and the wine.. well who drinks wine with burgers unless you're trying to make yourself look more sophisticated then you actually are. Just kidding, I love you, you know that right?",

    "text": "I can't explain my current obsession with burgers. I seem to go through this every once in a while. Maybe as my body prepares for winter. (Concerning since it is currently 112.)   BUT burgers are my rage. Good thing Honey likes to feed his inner carnivore as well. We've been busy.  We did Zinburger in Tucson early in the summer and had a pretty good experience. Burgers were great, fries were a little more flimsy and undercooked than I liked but held enough promise and flavor (say TRUFFLE) for a repeat attempt. Service was awesome. Now it proved time to join the crowds on Camelback and see how Phoenix's Zinburger ranks.   The place is cute but - and this may just be ME (ME being from Wisconsin, the land of cheese and dairy farms and cows wandering along the side of the road) - but why do you choose to have a mural of cows in a burger joint? I care NOT to be reminded of the fact that I am eating an animal. And a nice one at that. Cows say Moooo and entertain my daughters and provide the \"nilk\" at our dinner table. How does this entice your customers? Am I supposed to look at the picture of the cows in the pasture and salivate? No. Instead I considered a PETA move and almost went for a gallon of paint. I digress.   Service was EXCEPTIONAL. We ordered a bottle of Tilia Malbec Syrah(Yum), the Samburger, zucchini fries and of course, the infamous double truffle fries.   Fries first...again, not sure if I agree with this move. I like to switch between bites of burger and fistfuls of fries and prefer not to fill up on the fries before I have a chance to even try my much needed MEAT. Next time I will ask that it all comes in one fell swoop.   Fries were perfect. The zucchini fries were thick, appropriately seasoned and breaded and had yummy dip. The truffle fries were SICK. So freaking good. Like stash-them-in-your-purse-for-later good.   Burger was kindly split for us and perfectly cooked. Bun was super soft, as was the burger (med-rare). It was a good burger. It was not the best burger. I have other burgers that speak to me more than Zinburger. But that's okay. You will like this burger.   Overall, I'm not sure it's as gourmet as some of the other places we frequent for burgers, but it is solid. Classic, if you will. The fries will keep me coming back. As long as I am not facing the wall of grazing cows, that is.",

    "text": "Being Vegan it's hard to find places to eat at that both yourself and non vegans will enjoy.   When I called ZinBurger to inquire about their \"Vegetable Burger\", I was told it was made with eggs but that if I could wait about an hour before coming in the chef would prepare one without eggs to accommodate a vegan.   I though that was awesome and I was very thankful!   So we get there and of course I order my \"Vegetable Burger\" with no cheese and no mayo. I also asked how it was prepared: fried?  The waitress told me they were grilled, another plus!   Husband orders the Samburger, No thousand, add an egg and we shared an order of hand cut fries.   Food arrives, it looks good. Although I notice my burger was not grilled it was most definitely pan fried, but it wasn't greasy at all so I was OK with that.  What I was not OK with is the fact that it is called a \"Vegetable Burger\" and it is in fact a \"Black Bean Burger\" and should read as such on the menu. If I had known it was comprised 99% of black beans I would have likely chose another restaurant to eat at.  It was just bland I had to slather it in mustard for any flavor and I only ate half.   On a scale of 1-10, 10 being best ever, Husband gave his burger and Creme Brulee shake a 9.  Well good for him, I know where he can get a good burger he likes, but as for me, I'm still searching for an Amazing Vegan Burger!  SO I give 3 stars for his experience and 2 for mine.",

    "text": "Usually a FRC place is a pretty safe bet for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't really feel that way about Zinburger.  On the particular day we chose to visit Zinburger, we had already eaten and True Food, just down the way, went to a movie, and then it was time to eat again.  Since we weren't terribly hungry, but the opportunity to eat again wouldn't present itself for a while, we decided to share some food here.  We each got a shake and then the Samburger (a bacon burger) and the sweet potato fries to split.  My shake was fantastic.  I got the creme brulee shake.  If my review was based solely off of my shake, this would be a 5 star review, but it's not.  The sweet potato fries were good, but only without the sauce.  I honestly thought the yogurt sauce was disgusting and inappropriately paired with the fries.  Something sweeter would have made more sense.  The burger was, well, just a burger.  I was sad that it wasn't anything special.  It didn't taste any better than anything else I have had before.  Too bad.  Unfortunately, our service here was awful.  Harold, or whatever his name is, was rude and snotty and pretty much ignored us for most of our meal while he chit chatted and shmoozed other tables.  He definitely showed his displeasure that we were splitting our food, making our bill smaller.  I do also have to make mention of the inappropriate placement of the hinges on the men's restroom door.  Read Glenn's review for a more thorough account, but yeah, it was gross.  Thankfully Debbie Porter informed me that they were installing a screen or something to fix the problem.  For future diner's sake, I hope so.    The more I think about it, the more I am sure I won't be back.  There are just way too many other burger joints around town to try and revisit.",

It's not a bad burger but I ordered the El Diablo Kobe burger and failed to see what was so special. I paid an extra $5 for it to be Kobe and was excited to taste the difference, and honestly neither me or my bf were able to tell. I was also excited about the truffle fries (since they are my favorite fries at The Yard House), but they turned out to be mediocre also. They have great aiolli sauces but that was the only thing that really stood out. Its a nice setting, very clean and classy, we were able to watch some college football from our booth. I would eat here again if a friend wanted to go, but otherwise I will probably go elsewhere next time I want a gourmet burger.",

I had a difficult time deciding between burgers (the homemade veggie burger with tomato marmalade- which I'm obsessed with right now- sounded so good). I was very hungry, so I decided I needed some beef. I ordered the Zinburger well done (yes, I like my hamburger meat practically burned and yes, I know carcinogens are bad). The burger comes topped with Manchego Cheese and wine braised onions. I nixed the mayo and added avocado. I ate every last bite of the buger (except for the slice of avocado that shot out of the burger and across the table - oops).   We all shared sweet potato fries and truffle fries, which were both very good! I personally didn't prefer their dipping sauces... yogurt (tzaziki style) and truffle aioli (seemed more like plain mayonaise).   Our waitress was excellent! Very attentive and informative about the food options.  I'd like to go back and try more!",

I'd go back for the Zinburger and the shake for sure, but I'd leave wishing I had some Delux fries and aioli.",

    "text": "The burger itself (daily special: $10 for angus, cheese, ranch, bbq sauce and an onion ring) was great but I'm not sure what constitutes it as a $10 burger. Also split a side of sweet potato fries - not the best I've had (they were seasoned with a crunch but no glaze or anything that really popped to make them stand out among other fries I've had) and the yoghurt dipping sauce was just about flavourless. The Kit Kat shake was amazing, though - real ice cream with real chocolate and Kit Kat blended together. Got a burger, shake and split a small basket of fries for under $20 not including the tip. I suppose that's not bad for a dinner but is still a little much for cheap eaters like myself.",

Just the smell walking into the place was enough to let me know I made the right decision to eat there.   My girlfriend and I split a Zinburger (if you're going to name a signature menu item after yourself, it better be good), a chicken sandwich, and an order of the double truffle fries. I absolutely loved the fries. I'm not even that big on fries, but I could have had another order just for myself! The Aioli dipping sauce was amazing. Ketchup would've been an insult to put on them. The server also aware when we ordered that we were going to split the meals, so they halfed the sandwiches, and put them both on each plate. A nice little touch. Both were phenomenal. My girlfriend rarely eats red meat and she enjoyed indulging in her half of the burger. We also split a creme brulee shake for desert. Just as good as it was the first time.   It was nearly 8:30 and we were seated promptly. A little corner table on the patio with the bar. It was a nice spot, but it got a little annoying because it was right by one of the main entrances of the mall's parking lot. Even that late, it was still a little distracting everything I heard a car making a turn just feet from our table. But the food at Zinburger remains top notch.",

My fabulous friend, Laura, introduced me to Zinburger for their milkshakes alone. I have since returned many a time to enjoy a Kit Kat milkshake (vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate is the best!). The milkshakes are always delicious and the bartenders are always attentive.   My Zinburger issue relates to their hours. Maybe it's not as weird as it seems, but they close at 9pm during the week. That seems really early. Even for a week night. Their weekend hours only last until 10pm which is also a bit lame. Not that I want to stay late and party at Zinburger, but I do like to get a late night milkshake from time to time (after visiting a non-burger joint).   Keep up the good work on the milkshakes and add some hours and I may eventually pop in for a whole meal. You never know...",

    "text": "In my other reviews you'll see that I love nearly all the Fox Restaurants. Which is True. For Zinburger, this is where the *nearly comes in.   I've eaten there more than a few times and on every occasion its been OK. -Which is why it gets 2 stars- The menu is tiny, but its a gourmet burger joint so you really can't ask for much else. The zucchini fries are triumphant. Truly wonderful. The burgers sound amazing when reading them but more than once they've come out just OK. Nothing terrible, but not as mouthwatering as they made them sound. I like how the wine list is portioned out too... pretty cut and dry. Don't bother asking your server about the wines though, they probably will just look at you with a stupid look on their face.   If you're with a big burger person and you're not a burger person, do not fret. They have TWO really good salads, so don't get too excited. My favorite is the one with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese, with or without chicken. Its very light and fresh.   On my last occasion my server was slow, meek, and dull. Having zero personality is one thing, but when she realized she forgot about my glass of wine and I had to remind her (about ten minutes later) she became very timid and hardly even came back to our table! I wasn't rude.. so I don't understand why she had a manager come by to drop it off. Anyway, it could just be me.   So all in all this place isn't bad FOOD wise... drinks are pricey and service has tended to suck.",

The service was a little on the slow side, we had to flag down the waitstaff once or twice to get their attention, but they were plenty friendly.  The burger itself was good, cooked just as I'd ordered it, and was pretty tasty too.  I was a little disappointed in the fried egg, it was a little overcooked and the yolk was completely solid, not what I expect from a burger with fried egg.  I decided to forgo the fries - $5 for a side of fries when I am already forking over $11 for a burger seems a little much.  Management sent us out a complimentary order of fries anyway due to the sluggishness of the service, and I wasn't impressed; they were limp and greasy.  As far as I could tell they just went across the street to McD's for the fries.  Most definitely not worth five bucks.  All in all I am not terribly impressed.  The food was good but not fantastic, the service was mediocre, and the prices were a bit much.  Sure, go and give it a try if you've never done it before, and if you're a fan of pretense you'll probably eat this place up.  If you're looking for a good burger, there's a lot of better choices.  As for me, I'm not likely to make a return visit.",

It is located in a the beautiful Biltmore Fashion Center where my beloved Captial Grille is as well.  I arrived at 11:00 at got a great booth table.  The restaurant has a trendy-up-scale decor that has outdoor and indoor seating.  Once I sat down, I immediately ordered the Kobe Beef Burger with chedder cheese, mushrooms and a fried egg.  On the side, I ordered their truffled fries and a slice of their banana cream pie for desert.  The burger contained 8 ounces of Kobe Beef which was juicy, flavorful and fatty-delicious.  The mushrooms, cheese and egg went terrific with the burger.  The bun was warm and very soft.....to a  point where the bun fell apart after one bite:(  The Kobe Beef Burger was not the best I have had...that title goes to the Old Homestead in NY.   But for 14.00...it was pretty good.  The truffled fries were cooked perfectly..just the right amount of truffle oil.  The banana cream pie was the bomb.....full of flavorful banana cream and whipped cream.  The service was outstanding......the HOT waitresses in their tight shorts + the cute mgr came by my table several times:)  A great burger meal............!!",

I found it WAY too crowded and noisy for my taste, but I suppose that's a good thing for the restaurant's bottom line, and they probably wouldn't have it any other way.  Things like service-staff training and quality control must be top notch there, because every waitstaff person I have dealt with there is uniformly pleasant, well-informed, fast, and helpful.  Similarly, in the four or five visits I have made, I have never had a QC nightmare with undercooked or overcooked food or screwed up orders - even when my wife ordered a fairly complicated custom sandwich.  For that, they defintiely deserve kudos because it is hard to tolerate inconsistency at a place like this.  But they are indeed consistent.....but unfortunately, it is only consistently \"good\" food, nothing special, especially at these prices.  This would be an easy 4-star if they found a way to shave 20% off the prices.  Just too much green for just normal \"good\" food, if you know what I mean.  But I like to focus on the positive, so I will say with confidence that the truffle-oil fries are a real treat, and well worth the $6.",

Since we were only in town for a few days from LA, we were searching to find the best places to grab some lunch , and ZinBurger popped up on the cell,  and was nearby. From beginning to end our meal was perfectly delicious! The strawberry lemonade started our journey into food Heaven, and from that point on we became fans! We even asked our waitress Shannon if they had a Zin in the LA area that we could run to as soon as we got back home. Even though my husband was stuffed by the end of his meal, he still had to try the banana cream pie that Shannon suggested.  Oh and I don't even have to mention how delicious it was, by this point I'm sure you can tell they had us hooked! It was my husband's birthday and when  Shannon later found out, they gave us the birthday discount that we didn't even know we could get. Oh yeah, when we come back to the Phoenix area you can best believe we will be making a stop at Zin...again and again! #ZucchiniFriesAreKiller",

    "text": "Finally tried this place after hearing all the rave reviews. Ambiance feels like the chain that it is. There are certain nice touches like the bar but really generic. Service was great. Even though there was a 45 minute wait, the staff was so sweet and friendly that it didn't feel like it at all. I ordered the house zinburger and truffle fries. For my first burger, I wanted to try the original.   Overall I felt the meat was good quality and you could taste the difference. It was juicy and done perfectly medium. But I have to say that the rest of the burger was uninteresting. The buns were fine, at times a bit dry. The garlic aioli was mild in flavor. I was disappointed. The truffle fries were good but honestly fries aren't all that difficult. Anything fried will taste pretty bomb and add truffle is a easy win.   Overall, didn't get swept up in the hype. Would go back and try something different.",

I loved the people watching . . . and dog watching. I wish we had brought ours with us. They, too, would have enjoyed it!  Service was excellent, even at such a busy time. We ordered some sides to start, zucchini fries and sweet potato fries.  The zukes were delicious, cooked in an ultra-lite batter and sprinkled with a little parmesan. The sweet potato fries were equally as good. Both were large portions!  Not a meat lover, I ordered the ahi sandwich minus the slaw and avocado and topped with braised onions and wild mushrooms. Absolutely splendid! My hubby ordered the Kobe burger, a nicely seasoned chunk of Kobe covered with cheddar cheese and wild mushrooms. The best he's had in a long, long time, he said.  I don't know where he put it, but my dear husband ordered the salted caramel shake. Wow is all I can say about the one \"bite\" I had . . . so thick and creamy . . . I was on Cloud Nine . . . and my husband was in a food coma afterwards! Yummy all the way around!",

The food is okay.  The zucchini is good, but I recommend splitting an order.  The burger I got was the weekly special, which had a lot if things going for it, because this special was similar to an In N Out burger.  It was overly greasy though, and the bun is very sweet, which was amplified by the sauce on the special burger.  I don't think I would go back if I knew the sweet, sponge buns were on every burger.",

I had the Turkey Burger and totally loved it. It was big, juicy, and flavorful. Our waitress was great. She was helpful and welcoming. Our group sat outside during a really nice Sunday afternoon. I got the feel of Zinburger as being a really unpretentious place in an area with a reputation of being high-end. It's a great place to go for casual dining with friends in a really trendy spot. The menu is the fine dining versions of casual food. I would definitely recommend and would love to go back.",

Fries were a little soggy but probably the way they were supposed to be. Never had them before. Asked server to bring more lemons for the water and she never brought them.

The zucchini fries were just as amazing with a well seasoned crust and parmesan! Even my boyfriend loved them and he hates vegetables!

    "text": "For a restaurant that does not serve extras with their burger, that is to say that fries do not come with your burger, you would think that they would make it up in service and presentation, but no they don't. The service is marginal. They have young, inexperienced waiters and waitresses who do not know the menu and are unable to make recommendations. Their presentation is weak. I've been there twice - once for a burger the other for a salad. The burger was nothing special and the chopped ahi, avocado, and cashew salad was oily, had 1 slice of avocado, and literally 3 cashews hidden in the salad. They are only receiving 1 star because the beer was very cold and well poured.   If you want a burger which should ALWAYS include fries, go somewhere else. Fries are extra and they try to make them special but without success. If you want a cold beer while your significant other is shopping at the Biltmore, stop in and take a load off. If you want a meal, go somewhere else.",

This restaurant fills both of those needs in a stylish, modern looking location on the front side of the Biltmore Fashion Park.    There are several burgers, sandwiches, and salads to choose from that are all created nicely.  Also not to forget any of their different style of fries and shakes that will helpful in a sinfully delightful experience.  Prices are moderate to near the high end for the type of cusine, but pretty much in line for the area.    The inside has a large wall/mural of cows grazing which is somewhat strange, but I'd say it's different in a good way.  Earth tones are abundant throughout creating a natural, relaxed atmosphere.  The place can get very loud when busy however.  With the design of the restaurant I don't think much or any attention was focused on the acoustics.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for a quiet time.  This is another restaurant that the Fox Restaurant group has created well receiving an instant buzz.  Great location, very good food, excellent service ,and a upbeat atmosphere.",

Milkshakes are great, def one of the best milkshakes I ever tried was their salted Carmel one... Only down fall was getting there 12 min early... It was cold out and just us two... We asked if we could eat real quick outside and be out before they closed.. (We eat real fast we were sharing a burger and fries..) the bar tender with hardly any personality or manners or maybe just was having a bad day wasn't helpful when I asked if he knew of a spot outside to sit... At the places I worked at... We don't consider it closed till the exact time.. Everyone has diff policies though but it just is bad for their business.. I see it as You should let everyone in till closing time comes then close the place!! The employees don't start actually \"cleaning & closing\" till everyone out that's at least what the places did I worked at as a kid..",

Places like Fez, Switch, Stax, etc, seem to rely on the sauce and fixin's...Zinburger relies on its meat.  They LEGITIMATELY \"cook to order\" and the toppings are fairly simple...nothing new...but the quality of meat makes the burger as \"mouth-wateringly\" delicious as a burger can be.  It doesn't get my full five stars, because paying a minimum of $10 for a burger (and NOTHING ELSE on the plate) is a bit ridiculous in a town where quality burgers are being sold on specials for between $3 and $5 WITH fries or salads!  Methinks the Fox restaurants are just a TINY bit pretentious.",

They have a daily special that rotates, but can be applied to different burger types as well (I don't eat beef, so I always get the turkey burger). They can also assure that the fries are cooked separately if you're a gluten-free kid like me.   For sure try to the sweet potato fries, I think they're better here than at Delux. I also love the cucumber dipping sauce that goes along with it.   It can get pretty busy on a weekend night, so be prepared to wait like 20 minutes. They also have a great bar area, and an outside seating area that has heaters in the winter.",

Aside from that, I don't think it has much to offer. Their sweet potato fries come with a yummy yogurt dipping sauce. And you can't go wrong with all their unique shakes - which they're also happy to split 2 or 3 ways for you if you want to share amongst your dining company.   Their burgers are nothing special - I would much rather go to the Grind or Deluxe which are both nearby. The few times I've ordered burgers here - my bun has been soggy (gross!). An underdone burger and soggy bun are big turnoffs for me!   I've also had their Roasted Chicken Salad which was just okay and my friend had the Chinese Chicken Salad which he said the same about. Wouldn't order them again, that's for sure.   As for shakes, I've had the Creme Brulee, Double Chocolate Mint Shake (my fave!) and the Kit Kat Shake. All delish!",

Our waitress was enthusiastic (especially about the dessert we ordered) and she kept my water glass full, which I really appreciate - that's present tense on purpose. I drink a lot of water.   However, the decor just doesn't fit... it's bright, and the booth we sat in was comfortable... somehow, though, there's a lack. It needs a touch more masculinity, a bit of grit, to really strike that burger joint chord.  I have to add that sitting at the bar instead of a booth improves the ambience. Also, the veggie burger, add avocado and pepperjack, sub ketchup and mustard for aoli, is something I crave on occasion.  And I love that they offer discounted to-go options during the movies in the grass. Spring and Fall the Biltmore shows movies out on the quad. If you haven't been, grab a blanket, call in your dinner order and get out to play!",

My boyfriend and I were looking for a great burger place for a date and my friend suggested this place.    For starters, our server was terrible!  I have been a server before and I understand that sometimes bad things happen at certain table throughout the night but wow girlfriend, serving is not for you.  The girl brought us a completely wrong meal the first time and forgot what we ordered.  When we waited for our actual meals to be brought out she still forgot the bacon on my burger and my boyfriends sweet potato fries.  MY boyfriend never got his requested sauces, no water refills, etc-disaster.  At the end the server ended up charging me for a Kobe burger (which I did not order and is more expensive) and did not apologize for any of the mistakes.  I ordered my burger medium and got it raw.  Trust me I like things a little on the rare side but this wasnt edible.  I ordered fresh mozzarella on my burger hoping for a nice thick creamy slice of cheese and I swear I got 1 slice of kraft singles.  The truffle fries were good.  Like I said before I love Fox Concepts and I usually dont rate places very bad but this place was not good and not what I was expecting.  I would have rather had a BK burger.",

    "text": "Manager Ashley Moorer saved what have would otherwise have been a disastrous experience for us tonight at Zinburger.   The restaurant is a featured player in the current Arizona Restaurant Week promotion - and they were completely unprepared for how much business this promotion would draw. As a result, we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. Interestingly - it was interesting when you weren't the one waiting for the table - tables inside and outside would be cleared, and then it would take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half-hour for people to be seated at those tables ... even though the wait appeared to have gone from 25 minutes to nearly an hour.  Our server was adequate, but just.   Good news is that the food (Zinburger, Samburger, yogurt-dill dip for the sweet potato fries, and chocolate cream pie) really did live up to the acclaim.   In the name of efficiency, we placed our dessert order with our food order, hoping to make an 8 p.m. comedy performance. It was not to be. The fries came ahead of the burgers - as an appetizer? - but the burgers took at least 20 minutes to appear. Then, the interminable wait for the dessert begain.  The waiter wandered by, said the dessert order would  be out momentarily. Ten minutes passed. The waiter apologized, saying the dessert station was backed up. Ten more minutes passed. The waiter went to look in on our dessert again. Two slices of chocolate cream pie. Not chocolate soufle - just plain old chocolate cream pie.  Finally - someone other than the server brought the pie. And, immediately after that, the manager herself came over to see us. Which means the waiter, who we thought was doing a pretty poor job all along, had the foresight to get his manager involved.  She explained that the staff had been overwhelmed with the Restaurant Week response, but she knew it wasn't an excuse. To make amends, she offered us free dessert on a future visit. I told her the food was good, but not nearly good enough to warrant the wait - and that we probably would not be returning to the restaurant in the future. That was when she stepped up and offered to treat us on the house - and serve us herself! - if we'd be willing to give her another try.  Also, she comped tonight's bill.  All in all, stellar performance by a manager who wanted to make things right for unhappy customers.  And, as I told my boyfriend, it's likely good news for all the coming Restaurant Week patrons, as there's no excuse, going forward, for the poor service.  Thanks, Ashley Moorer. You saved the day!",

When arriving I thought we might have a long wait but we had just the right amount of time we grabbed a beer at the bar and watched the game right about halfway done they called us for our table.    We had both checked out the menu online so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Zinburger which had Manchego Cheese, Zinfandel Braised Onions & Mayo.  I got it medium rare and it was amazing.  The juices were dribbling down my arms and it was messy just like a real burger should.  We both got fries to share one order of sweet potato and one of the double truffle.  The sweet potato fries were good but the dipping yogurt was just ok.  Tasted a lot like tzatziki sauce.  The double truffle fries were really good we finished them all.    For the dessert I had the Creme Brulee Shake that had Vanilla Ice Cream, Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Fresh Cream & Crushed Caramel.  OMG that was my heaven in a glass.  That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy.    I left in a total food coma and can't wait to go back again.

    "text": "I was SO excited for Zinburger as I had previously been to the Tucson location but I'm sad to say that it wasn't what I remembered at all.  When I had initially went, I still dabbled in meat and was lovin' the turkey burger.  So, maybe the turkey burger is still okay (but it doesn't seem so from other reviews) but I had the veggie burger this time around.  Let's just say I spent most of my evening puking that veggie burger up.  They put this weird tomato marmalade on it, which wasn't pretty coming back up.  Sorry for the graphic nature of that sentence.  I'm not in the business of giving restaurants that make me ill a second chance, so the likelihood of me returning is pretty much zero.",

    "text": "I'm very glad that I gave Zinburger a second chance... they have certainly redeemed themselves.  On our first visit (with the 4-year-old, mind you), we were told the wait was 5-10 minutes... 25 minutes later, we were finally sat... with an incredibly annoyed child in tow.  We didn't have the greatest service (slow, forgotten items, etc), and I was shocked by the high price tag of a child's meal.  I really wish that they would put this on the menu... I definitely would have just shared my own burger with the kid, if I had realized!  HOWEVER - the Creme Brulee shake was just incredible.  The light dusting of salty goodness on top just sends it over the edge!    Since the shake was so unbelievable, I decided to give Zinburger another chance last night.  My sister and I were seated after a very short wait (appropriately estimated this time - improvement noted!), and our lovely waitress, Nikki, overheard me relaying my first experience to my sister.  Much to our surprise, our waitress had the manager, Danielle, come over and chat with us about our previous experience... and she graciously comp'd our divine milkshake.  Now, THIS is a way to change slightly irritated customers into raving fans.  I loved that they took the time to acknowledge my concerns and went to extra lengths to make sure I was satisfied.    I will definitely return - as soon as I need a \"fix\" of milkshakes and yummy burgers.",

    "text": "4 or 5 stars for the food, but a couple things rubbed me the wrong way about this place.  First there was the decor.  Although I love huge wall photo-murals, I found the gigantic cow-in-a-pasture scene off-putting.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I care about animals to the extent that when I'm eating meat I don't like to think about the actual slaughter part.  So seeing the sunny cow mural when I walked in just gave me a bad image of those poor shiny happy cows being murdered.  Yes, we're eating cows, but let's have some respect.  Luckily I had already planned on having the vegetable burger.  Decor-wise I also found the servers' brown uniforms pretty heinous.  Zinburger: Since when are fries an appetizer?  Who eats a complete meal and then orders a milkshake for dessert?  The waitress was nice enough to ask if we wanted our shakes for dessert or with the food (with the food - duh!), but she failed to ask if we wanted our fries with our burgers.  The Double Truffle fries were awesome but unfortunately there weren't many left by the time the burgers came out.    I highly recommend Clint's Almost Famous Vegetable Burger, which is more of a black bean burger and comes with cheese and a fresh tomato topping.  It was huge and had a lot of flavor.  I appreciate that Zinburger has several salads and a veggie burger for those of us trying to eat on the \"lighter side\" (if you don't count the fries and root beer float I couldn't turn down).  The Bananas Foster Shake was out-of-this world, as you can imagine from the name.  And the root beer float...well, how can a root beer float ever be bad?",

    "text": "Another place I really wanted to like. Like Joel L. says below me, this is absolutely a style over substance place. Took my Dad and boss there over the weekend to catch up, have a burger and a milkshake, and hopefully impress my dad who is the milkshake nazi if one has ever existed.  We got an order of the Zucchini Fries to start which were actually very delicious. I was pleased with the quality of the zucchini as well as the consistency. They were not overly breaded and fried and therefore soggy, they were just right. I got their version of a Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake which was delicious but so sweet I got a stomach ache about 5 minutes into drinking it which was kind of a bummer. Our waiter overheard my Dad giving his milkshake diatribe which basically consists of \"Young people don't know how to make a milkshake anymore blah blah blah\" so poor thing bless his heart tried as hard as he could to take all of my father's demands into account on this simple chocolate shake and just failed miserably. In the business of full disclosure, he never had a chance so I cannot hold that against them.  Things took a turn for the worst when we got to the burgers. My Dad and I each ordered the Zinburger, his cooked Medium and mine cooked Medium Well. His came out Medium Well and mine Well Done. The beef wasn't terribly flavorful in my opinion. The manchego cheese and other toppings were nice, but the real issue for me lies with the buns. By the time the burgers got to our table, the buns were already so soggy that you couldn't even pick up the burger without the whole thing falling apart! Serious issue as all burger eaters out there know. We each ended up trying to knife and fork it which wasn't terribly successful either.  All in all I find Zinburger to be just average. Didn't hate it, but certainly didn't love it. I must go out of my way however to say how exemplary our service was there. Our waiter was fantastic and took excellent care of us.  However when the hunkering for a $10 burger hits me, you will continue to find me at Delux or Houston's...",

I think you're paying a bit extra for the location (mall) and the knowledge that you're eating local ingredients.

    "text": "I came in just before happy hour and the place was nearly empty when I arrived, which is what I was hoping for/expected on a weekday. I grabbed a table, propped open a book I had long been neglecting, and ordered a milkshake at the suggestion of my knowledgeable server whose name escapes me (I want to say Audrey/Aubrey?)  I had a hankering for something sweet and savory and found the Butterfinger shake to be just the right combination leaving me quite content. The consistency/temperature of the shake was near perfect. Solid enough to use the spoon, but smooth enough to use the straw, stayed cold the entire time, but never gave me brain freeze and I'm pretty sensitive.   (Tip: Start by eating the candy pieces at the top to get your taste buds attuned to the flavor of your shake. Plus then you'll have less to dig for at the bottom when you finish)  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries because I'm a sucker for anything sweet potato and couldn't pass up an opportunity to take advantage of the half off happy hour menu. The fries arrived hot and crispy with a side of ketchup and a variation of tzatziki sauce. The first half was excellent and served at just the right temperature but the second half got soft from the steam and was significantly less enjoyable. Perhaps serving in a basket with less air exposure might help.  But for now if you're going solo or not in a sharing mood, then I'd advise eating quickly or maybe asking them to fry a little longer.  For an upscale \"burger\" chain, this place had a good vibe, a tasty menu, and great service.  Update: They also validate parking!",

After ordering and letting the waiter know of my allergy I find out half way eating that the bun was a gluten bun. (My friend tasted mine to compare.) And my horrible reaction hours later went to confirm. The server had only a few tables since it was about closing- but kept messing everything up. He would ask the same questions repeatedly and then brought back someone else's checks with their credit cards.  I suspect the waiter was either under the influence or slightly incompetent. The food is good- but the service was unacceptable.",

We arrived around 5:30 and were able to be seating on the patio quickly (luckily it wasn't too hot yet).  Our server was with us quickly, and was pleasant/helpful/friendly the hole time.    For starters, we got the truffle fries which were good.  Nice and warm and crispy, and I liked the little dipping sauce that came with them.  For my burger, they had a special of the day which was a turkey burger with avocado/swiss.  I liked the sounds of the topping, but not so much of the turkey burger, and it was no problem for me to get the 'special burger toppings' on the beef burger.  To wash down my burger, I ordered the Creme Brulee milkshake.  The burger came out and was very good...I would definitely go there again for a high-quality burger.  The milkshake, it wasn't great, definitely good, but not great.  There just wasn't a strong enough creme brulee flavor for me.    The wife had some sort of veggie burger that she liked and a glass of wine that she also enjoyed.  We thought that the bill was reasonable.  We would definitely consider going back to Zinburger.",

It must be something about them soaked in wine :) Last visit I did try it low-carb style, without the bun, and it was definitely missing something so I'll just have to workout extra hard when I know this place is on tap for dinner. We also enjoy their zucchini fries with ranch, a lot...but I've had them three different times and each time have been different. Time number 2 was absolutely the best but I can't put my finger on what is happening different. This place is usually fairly busy and it can make service a bit impersonal and a smidgen slow but we've always gotten everything out without too long of a wait. I've also tried one of their shakes but honestly, can't really remember what it was so it wasn't too memorable. Overall, a great, casual place for lunch or dinner. Love the patio too!",

They split 2 baskets of the sweet potato fries. I found them limp and bland, and didn't care for the dipping sauce (mayo-ish).  What was fantastic was the burger. I got the Zinburger, and it arrived literally 2 minutes later, perfectly cooked. It was flavorful, juicy, and just amazing. Now and again the onion flavor poked through, though I never really tasted the cheese. In the end, I didn't miss it--the burget was that great.  The restaurant was family friendly with tons of kids around. It is also pretty loud (as sparse, cement-y restaurants tend to be). The menu is miniscule, but that's ok. Just stop in for a quick, reasonably priced bite to eat.",

The burger has a home made bun that is delicious...mushrooms and cheddar.  It is well seasoned and juicy...I'm talking double napkin!  Also, they have a Buffalo Chix sandwich that is one of the best.  The Chicken is juicy yet crispy on the outside...it is spicy so you need the ranch!  They will serve things protein style which is nice.  If you have room get the Kit Kat shake...they will split it if need be!

And it's not because my taste buds would have rather been slathered with a bbq bacon burger, but it just was not good.  I sat there and poked at it miserably .

I mean it was so disgusting we had grease running down our hands ( how do you get so much grease in a lean meat like turkey, what's the point!). then my husband had to catch a flight where he ended up belching the entire time with an upset stomach.  I know the review sounds harsh and I really hate to give such a low rating but honestly, it was the worst by far I have had for turkey burgers and a total disappointment. I thought it was also in poor taste to see some of the wait staff two tables away laughing and counting their tips and playing around. I wont be coming back. Just not worth the effort.",

I'm typically not too hot on most Sam Fox restaurants but this is one of the exceptions.  Sure it has the style and flair of its other restaurants.  But it also has a menu that matches the concept.  The burgers are executed flawlessly and they are just unique enough to distinguish them from their Biltmore neighbors.  The shakes were as decadent as weekday matinee, not at all necessary but very tasty.   The fries were great although we thought that the yogurt sauce pairing with the sweet potato fries was a little off.  Top off the experience with some incredible service by our waiter who had the same look and enthusiasm as the indefatigable Steve O and you've got a memorable experience.  The burger gauntlet has been laid and all worthy participants should report to the Biltmore.",

The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!   Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \"ok\". The report from the Zinburger was \"ok and undercooked according to my order\". The sweet potato fries were delicious.    The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!   As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance. From most of the other reviews, I don't expect a long wait for tables in this place the very near future.",

    "text": "\"So I'm guessing truffles are kinda like tomatoes?\"  \"No, boyfriend. It's a kind of mushroom\"  Even after waiting in line for 15mins (gets packed here cos all the office people come out) We couldn't decide between the truffle fries, sweet potato fries or the zucchini straws so we got all of them. Our piggy asses stuffed each light, crispy and bursting with flavor chip into our holes dipping in all the different sauces waiting for our meaty burgers. All of which have their own distinct smell and all are just as good. I say everyone picks a side - and share.  Needless to say - $16ish for a burger is a lot of money. I got the kobe one with mushrooms and swiss, while boyfriendy got the normal cheeseburger. While both the burgers were grilled to our desires (mine, medium rare that's cool and pink in the middle and boyfriendy's medium well's brown) I'm pretty sure we could get the same effect with Costco's burger patties and my Dad's cooking skills.  We missed out on the dessert because we were just stuffed from the burger and fries - they messed up on an order of salad and charged us for a cheaper one (should have been free!) and we sat outside by the mist-ti-fiers before heading out to Paradise cookie.  Overall - good location, they validate your parking, kinda-sexpensive and not overall healthy. BUT - a gourmet burger joint is a gourmet burger joint and not one to miss if you're in the area.",

But they really should allow diners to do \"half and half\" fries to try different kinds or they should make half-size orders...the server said they were \"working on it,\" whatever that means. Zinburger -- meh. I definitely enjoy the burgers at Delux more, and for $10, you should get a superb burger. The beef was good quality but not incredibly flavorful, and the burger overall was bland. Also, the bun was a little too soft to support the burger patty and toppings.  Service was good - although the hostess underestimated our wait time quite a bit, she apologized, and then our server was great. The atmosphere is just okay - plain and modern, almost corporate feeling... a bit like Sauce, another Fox place. The bar area is nice, though.

But the burger did justice, so I really didn't care. Got a milkshake at the end and I was not impressed. It wasn't creamy like I'm used too. Service was great though, burgers were delish.

We had a great booth - giving us a vantage point, watching the parade of customers & employees. I really like the airy, roomy, high energy vibe. With our drinks we had the delicious zucchini fires with two sauces an a subtle breading on the zucchini. We all tried different burgers, with some of us tasting each others, Candace made the split arrangements prior to serving us - nice touch. The meat is flavorful, melting in your mouth with a freshly baked bun. Fun, cool atmosphere & great food - made for a great get away, early in the week.

Burgers are decent sized and lovely, but they're not gigantic, and sans sides, I'd stop well short of calling one \"a meal\".  I'm hardly a power eater and could've downed two fairly easily.   We had two of their cheapest burgers, fish sandwich, a shake, glass of wine, Diet Coke and split an order of fries. After tip it was $70, and you kinda ask yourself \"Am I really in a burger & shake place, or maybe something pretending to be?\"   Example. The menu doesnt list soft drinks, presumably to push the more expensive shakes and wines. Of course I got my Coke anyway, without a hint of attitude, which was nice. But at a corporate level, something about that rubs me the wrong way. The \"idea\" that ordering a Coke at a burger and shake place isnt on, or by implication \"with\", The Program.   It's Fox all the way. Pretty setting, friendly but inexperienced service, fun menu, generally tasty and overpriced food. Sharing plates or cutting expenses at happy hour might make it a more attractive option.",

Yes u r welcome :) 2. Huge portions for the fries and shakes. We got zucchini tots & sweet potato fries. They were good.  3. The salads look amazing as well, try em  4. The ambience is good and service good, even if a tad slow   Cons 1. No fries are included with the burger and this always gets to me, why should we pay more to get fries, common no burger is complete without the fries!! It's not like the burger is huge to be worth $10. When u order the fries though be careful it's huge, so better to share it with someone.  2. The place is a bit on the expensive side for a burger place  All said I m coming back to get the veggie burger again. Love the places like these that are puttin effort into making the vegetarians happy as well",

My bill came to $17.59, I only had water, so with tip it was $21.00. Was it worth it, no. It's overpriced by a few dollars. While I was driving home, I started thinking every time I leave a sam fox restaurant, I think the same thing, yea it was good, but why so pricey. I don't get how sam fox can charge 15-20% overpriced and get away with it. People keep showing up. So I will not be back to Zinburger, it was good, but not for that price.",

    "text": "I have been here a number of times and can't believe that I haven't given them a review yet!  In all the times that I have been here, I always go with the Breakfast Burger.  Fried egg on a burger with bacon? Yes please!  The burgers are so juicy and delicious, with the avocado and cheesy, it feels almost wrong... almost.  The reason I couldn't give them a 5 star rating is that I have a fundamental problem with fries that you have to order as a side, ESPECIALLY at a burger place.  Now, that being said, they have good fries and even better zucchini fries.  They certainly give enough for there to be two servings but again, additional charges for fries just seems wrong at a burger place.  I could see there being an upcharge for loaded fries or zucchini fries or even just to make them sweet potato fries.  They have a great selection of beers (my personal favorite is Left Coast \"Voodoo\" American Stout which I've never seen offered anywhere else in Arizona so that was a bonus point) and drinks to accompany the meals.  The shakes are a great way to finish off the meal, sometimes they have specialty shakes such as the Butterfinger (shake which I think is now on the regular menu) which is just amazing.  Little on the pricey side but well worth it for a good burger.",

    "text": "For the birds!  Zinburger is one of those hip trendy places that is part of the so-called Burger Revolution, and sits right in the middle of the area of Phoenix that is known as Hamburger Row. What does this mean? Basically that it's a restaurant that can charge you $12 for a hamburger. Have the culinary arts \"progressed\" to the point that we know think of a burger as a gastronomical adventure and worth more than $6-7??? that is NUTS. Its a burger, get over yourselves pseudo-foodies.  Well I gave it a try, because our party wanted to go there. Since you don't get a side with your entree, I found it odd that they served it on a large plate that was meant for more than 1 item. The burger looked pretty lonely on that big plate with nothing else on it.  Right off the bat, they got my order wrong - I asked for medium-well and it arrived totally rare. That is a big turnoff for me - either someone doesn't listen or the cook is just incompetent. I told the server and he just took the plate away; someone else, I assume a manager came out with another burger, cooked to order, in like 1 minute. That was odd, they must have given me someone else's. He was apologetic, but only enough to perform his duties without actually showing that it matters if they can cook their burgers properly or not. This tells me it happens often, and they are used to it.  Now the burger itself - the applewood smoke bacon tasted only of cured salt. In fact, it gave the entire burger nothing but this massive salt taste. It was like a sodium megabomb with none of that real bacon flavour, just the curing. The rest of the burger was a big soggy mess... the bun was way too small and pretty much disintegrated before I got halfway through. In the end I was basically just eating bits of the patties covered in the condiments, and not actually holding a burger in my hand. It all just felt and tasted wrong. As a lover of classic American hamburgers, to me this place is for birds. Waste your money on something you can barely eat half of, because you are in a hip scene. BS. Your wealthy grandmother may like it, but it's not a place for full-blooded American men who want a satisfying hamburger, even one that is more fancy than your average burger joint. Personally, if I am going that route, I will stick to Delux Burger, because there you can actually taste the quality you are overpaying for! That is a delicious hamburger that does not disappoint, unlike Zinburger which I cannot recommend to another man and look him in the eye with no shame.",

Our server, besides being very attentive and friendly, was also extremely knowledgeable about the preparation and ingredients. It showed me that Zinburger really knows their burgers and takes the time to educate their staff. It also served to heighten my expectations...which weren't let down.  The quality of my burger was very apparent. The bun was fresh, the meat was high grade, and the other ingredients were also well thought out. I love when restaurants are meticulous with their creations. This is a superb burger, expertly prepared from the creation of the patty (not too compressed) to the cooking of it (a perfectly pink in the middle \"medium\" is what I ordered and received). Simply great.  The milkshakes are over-the-top rich and delicious--like eating whole pint of Haagen Dazs. We all shared one, and it was still overkill. Great tasting though.  The fries were a little \"meh\" to me. Not sure why. They were hot & fresh, but a little bland. I tried the Truffle Fries as well, and they were also a little boring. Maybe they should try a different kind of oil or potato...or both. They were decent fries, just not as \"top notch\" good as the burgers.  Lastly, for a \"burger joint,\" the service was excellent...to the point of fine dining type pampering. Very nice. Overall, I'm a fan. I'm looking forward to returning.",

    "text": "Very Cool place. Been liking this place since 2012. Sat at the bar today so I can watch the game more closely, I always get the turkey burger EVERY time , but today I decided to stretch my tastebuds. I ordered the \"My boy blue burger\" and I must say it was DELICIOUS  ,  just had water because I was disappointed with the draft choices, They were not very good choices. They have a bar but it's NOT a bar. This is NOT the place to watch a game at all, the TV were turned all the way down, and they were playing music, so I had to watch the game with no sound , do you know how frustrating that is?  Food = 5 Service = 4 Ambiance = 3 Beer choices = -1",

Negatives: If you don't feel like paying $50 for a family of 3 to eat a burger and frys that are completely blah.. Don't waste your time. The burger was very juicy however it had zero seasoning? I mean it is like they completely left it out? The fries were equally as blah. No salt. So there goes that theory.  My salad was mediocre.  Sadly, I'd skip this place. I only write this review for two reasons: 1) in hopes they will realize they need to season their food better and it will improve  2) to warn you not to waste your money at this time",

I got the truffle fries for everyone to share. The fries came with a white sauce that compliment the perfectly salted fries.   I went here for a young professional meetup with 12 others. Parking was only free for 2 hours. I think I was there for a total of 4 hour but paid $2 for the additional time I was there after parking validation. Service to large group was phenomenal. I hear their shakes are to die for. I'll have to try that when I go back for more.",

    "text": "In the mood for something different, my husband and I checked out Zinburger this Sunday afternoon for an early dinner. After figuring out the Biltmore's token parking situation, we wanted to take the opportunity to enjoy \"Phoenix winter\" out on the patio. The hostess station was a bit chaotic, especially given that the restaurant wasn't very busy, but after a few minutes, we were seated at a two-top on the patio that turned out to be a fantastic spot to people-watch.   I was excited to try the My Boy Blue, a burger topped with caramelized onions and rich blue cheese. The flavors and texture were spectacular, but the gluten-free bun (while delicious) wasn't able to withstand the sauciness of this particular burger and began to dissolve in my hands. I gave up and ate the last third with a knife and fork, wishing I had stashed a wet nap or something in my purse to address the mayo situation. My husband had the special of the day, a triple-decker that the waiter described as a Big Mac, \"but better.\" The gf bun held up much better on his burger - then again he also has much bigger hands :) We split a basket of fries, prepared in the dedicated gf fryer, which were pleasantly crisp.   I was a little disappointed to see such cheap liquors in their signature cocktails (Smirnoff? Whaaaa?) and ordered the blood orange lemon drop (with Ketel One) with my meal. I'm always worried that the bartender is going to make a \"girly\" drink too sweet, but I was pleasantly surprised by the balanced flavor and decent buzz found in this $8 cocktail. My husband doesn't share my aversion to sweets, and indulged in a root beer float, served in a huge glass for $6. Their rich vanilla ice cream made this float a decadent treat.   Two drinks, two gf burgers, and a large fry came out to $48 before tip. Not cheap, but for the quality of beef and refreshing gluten-free selections, I'm sure we'll be back to try more of the menu!",

    "text": "This is my favorite burger place! I love the what they are doing here. I'm a total wine person and normally you can't find a truly good wine at a place that specializes in burgers so I am hooked. I normally get the Zinburger with the Tobin James Zinfandels and the Double Truffle fries and I will sit there for over an hour waiting to get more room in my stomach just so I can finish it all.   They just switched up the happy hour menu which I am not happy about, but it just makes my bill about $3 more which I can live with. Just this past time I realized I do appreciate that they added the smaller sized burgers to happy hour, however. They don't advertise them correctly; they call them slider sized, they are 4oz or about quarter pounder size which is perfect for me compared to the 7oz normal sized burger. Now I just get that over the regular burger which actually brought my bill down a dollar and made my walk back to the car more of a True walk and not a painful waddle from how stuffed I used to be.  My only recommendation is that they add the smaller patties to the normal menu because I would never go back to eating a full sized burger unless I was feeling like a bottomless pit and that is going to restrict how often I go back. My husband enjoys the 7oz patties and I don't think that option should be taken away, but he is nearly double my size at 6'5 with a healthy appetite so he could use the extra caloric intake.",

    "text": "Second experience  Below is my first review of this restaurant. After my first experience the owner reached out to me and gave me a gift card so I could try it again; which I thought was very generous offer on her part. So, my husband, our son and I went their for lunch. It was a better experience this time. Both times the hamburgers were cooked spot on. We all ordered medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. Both times the buns were exceptionally fresh and toasted to perfection. Our son had a build your own burger. It was piled high with generous portions of the various toppings he selected. My husband had the breakfast burger. He was impressed this time with the flavor and the seasoning. I had the my boy blue burger. The blue cheese was wonderful and just the right amount. The A1 sauce gave it just enough kick, but not so much were it would overwhelmed the burger. We also shared the loaded fries. They two were flavorful and had generous portions of bacon and cheese sauce. We would definitely go to Zen burger again!  First experience: Well...I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. But it just wasn't that good. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. It looked beautiful. The bun was really good. It was cooked well. It just didn't have much flavor. I don't even think they put a dash of salt on the burger. And the fries sounded amazing in theory. I ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. But they were over cooked and also tasteless. Even with all of this said because I didn't hate it I could've overlooked a lot othe service was better.",

Such a simple gesture but the fact that they did this all on their own was so cute! Aside from that, our server Stevan was professional and just the right amount of attentive.

Bad managers will just blow off customers and be condescending.   Since great managers actually listen to feedback they will investigate and if there is a problem no matter now small they will correct it.  That is what a great manager does.  Bad managers will just cash their checks till a place closes down then they will go to the next place and rinse and repeat.  Caitlin Jensen is a great manager.  Caitlin listens to customers, actually reads the reviews and corrects the problem.  Caitlin read my review that they over-salted my meal and contacted me.  Said hey we pride ourselves on quality and said give us a second try.   I believe in second chances because we all have off days, so I took her up on her offer.  Only the second time this have ever happened since I have been Yelping from 2010 with over 153 reviews.    Now think about how many garbage managers never took the time to reach out.   That is what separates Caitlin from all the mediocrity I have dealt with in my life.  Now I want to make this very clear.  I don't go around bitching and moaning trying to get meals comped.  I am not that person.   If you read my reviews you will get 100% unadulterated truth from my perspective.  I am not nor will I ever be an elite 100 yelper that goes around eating free food and dishing out FAKE REVIEWS.      I promise you authenticity.   So on to my second review.   I headed back to ZinBurger on Super Bowl Sunday.   I know a crazy time to go back.  But I did it.   I mixed things up a bit this time.   I didn't order the Truffle fries.  I kept it simple with regular fries.   100% perfect.    Crispy and seasoned to perfection.   My Zinburger was great, onions were very good wine flavor they had been sauted in.  And the beers I ordered were great.  I just said dealers choice and bring me a bunch till the game was over.  Yeah I got a bit drunk.    Carlos Sr came with me.  He ordered the El Diablo and stole about half my fries.  He ate that thing so fast I don't think he had any problem with the flavor.  So yeah before Zinburger had an off day or I was completely bombed drunk during the Super Bowl this time to notice the neither.   Either way I had a great time and they made a ton of money on me today by inviting me back. hahahahahaha   Kudos.     Class acts.   I will be back.  Nice people.",

    "text": "I am usually very impressed with FRC restaurants but Zinburger left much to be desired.   In searching out the best burger I thought that Zinburger would be a contender but I was profoundly let down.   When considering my rating I took into account the following: Ambiance, Service, and of course Food Quality/Presentation.   My meal consisted of a Pint of Kiltlifter, A Samburger (Bacon, Cheese and Thousand Islands) well-done, and an order of Fries.   Ambiance: The place has a very clean look but it's nothing special. I actually find the wall mural of cows in the pasture a little morbid. \"Look, here's a picture of your food before it is slaughtered and cooked to order (for some).\" I sat at the Bar which was not busy at all.   Service: When I ordered my beer ($5.50) it was served to me in a nicely frosted glass which I love with my beverage. However, when I took a sip I had this piece of paper flow into my mouth. I brought it to the bartenders attention and she mentioned that she had just made a shake and was wondering where that piece of paper from the straw had gone? She apologized but obviously wasn't too concerned about it and laughed it off. She replaced the beer but I was not impressed with how it was dealt with. She didn't look into the glass before she poured my drink? So that's how my dinner started and it set the tone to a consistently disappointing experience.  I ordered fries ($5) and expected something special for the price of a bag of potatoes. They were nothing special at all. They were home cut fries which were not too oily but had no seasoning on them whatsoever. They desperately required salt and pepper which is not readily available. When the food runner asked if I needed anything I replied \"Salt and Pepper please\" He nodded and smiled then never returned and instead went to bus some tables. Thanks buddy!  After I realized that the food runner only asks questions but doesn't follow through in answering them, I asked the bartender for the salt and pepper and she went and grabbed me some.  Then my burger came. ($11.50) I knew immediately that the burger was not going to be cooked properly because it came out way too quick to have been cooked well done.   I was expecting something with a nice seasoning, cooked well (No pink, a little crisp on the outside) and with an overall flavor that would require no ketchup. I don't like to use ketchup on my burgers but use it when they lack flavor.   I bit into this burger and it was definitely not well-done. It was medium well at best. The more offensive part of this burger was it's complete lack of flavor in the meat. It was just ground meat with no taste at all. Very bland and it unfortunately needed the help of Heinz. I will say the bun was amazing. It was soft, fresh and was the best part of the burger (which is sad).  The only time I was asked how things were is when the fries were brought out and there was no follow-up at all. It was not overly busy and there was no reason to not inquire as to how my meal was.   Once I bit into the burger I knew I would not return because I get more flavor from a Smashburger that is less than half the price. As I write this my stomach aches because I do not respond well to under-cooked meat.  Overall, this was a substandard dining experience. Next time I feel like spending that much on a Burger dinner I will venture one mile east on the same road to Delux. They source their meat from the same company and cook their burgers much better along with having flavor which was lacking here. Their fries also come with a variety of dipping sauces that make the experience much more enjoyable at the same price point and the bartenders will actually engage you aside from just taking your order.   I eat out every day and with a plethora of places to choose from, Zinburger will never again be one of them.   So far this is my only bad experience at any of the FRC establishments. You can't win them all. Honestly, the only reason this got two stars is because the place is clean.",

    "text": "I was carving a bacon cheeseburger so you guys know I searched yelp for the best one in town!  I've heard so much about zinburger and couldn't wait to give it a try and see what the rave was all about!  Stopped by on a weeknight it wasn't super packed but there was a crowd. I have to say customer service was amazing. The hostess was very nice and welcoming. Our server was very nice and really knowledgeable on the food. We told him it was our first time there and he gave us a really warm welcome. (I wish I could still remember his name) he was really attentive and my son loved him. The menus are to the point MY KIND OF MENU!!   I ordered  the Sam burger which is basically a cheeseburger with applewood smoked bacon; HOT DAMN! Lol it was amazing the only complaint about it would have to be that I ordered it medium well and it came out pretty much well done. My friend ordered the diablo and in his own words \"the best jalapeno burger I have ever had, I would come back just for this\" my son loved his burger and his chocolate shake.   We also ordered the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries. My favorite were the truffle honestly if you have ever had a Mexican style corn that is basically what these truffle fries taste like specially with the dipping sauce they provide.   The only thing I would have to say they need to work on is faster food preparation. It did take a very long time for our meals to arrive, but maybe we caught them on a bad night (totally understandable).  All in all we had a wonderful experience at zinburger and definitely will be back.",

I can think of 5 other burger places I would think to go to before Zinburger would come to mind. Our service was good and the atmosphere was nice.

Absolutely great- juicy, flavorful and awesome. The fries were equally as fantastic. Crispy, potato-y, just great. Beer selection is ok- decent, but I'm a total beer snob.   Then there's the issue of the service. It's definitely busy-ish. Not crazy by any stretch and the service was sub par at best. I got my food before my beer. Like literally 15+minutes to get my beer. Then the server came back and asked me what type of beer I had ordered. oooohhhkay. Just get me my damn beer, hell, any beer would suffice at this point!   Anyways? I'd give it another go for sure- maybe that particular server was having an off day.",

    "text": "Restaurants seem to have struck gold in capitalizing on the modern-day desires of burger lovers that stress the importance of quality over price. Especially when it comes to dropping an extra five dollar premium to upgrade your burger to \"grass-fed\" status - quite possibly the biggest scam since that creepy telemarketing dude kept promising me that I could make ten grand a month by working from home.  Interestingly enough, higher quality burgers have quietly existed on menus at restaurants for many years, especially steakhouses. But it wasn't until the last decade that people realized that these burgers could easily be marketed more prominently. And it seems that they all opened up at exactly the same damned time. Zinburger is no different.   After a handful of visits, we've had the Samburger, Zinburger, and Breakfast. By the standards of fast food? Sure, it's in a whole other league.  But in comparison to all of the other cookie-cutter premium burger joints in this area? Not even close. I feel burgers at places like Ingo and Hopdoddy are superior in taste, although I'm still not entirely sure why.  We've also tried double truffle fries, zucchini fries, and a \"loaded\" variation. All the fries are decent, although not to the point where I'd rank them over some other places I've visited.  Our favorite shake is the Nutella Hazelnut Crunch, while making the oh so controversial decision to modify it with a banana for a dollar extra. I really like that they let you split the shakes, serving them in separate glasses.    I sort of roll my eyes at all of these Fox concepts, because they can essentially open whatever type of restaurant they want, in whatever area they want, with the funds to make it look however they want. Although I will always find more appreciation in individually owned burger places built from the ground up, there isn't really anything particularly offensive about their food. And while I'd recommend Zinburger for an occasional visit, I'd also recommend the 50 other burger places in Phoenix that pretty much use an identical approach - just not quite as heavy on the whole \"hip corporate\" vibe.  It's nothing innovating, but it works for the \"concept\" that it is, I guess.",

I told the server we wanted drinks before we order. I was making more of statement than anything.  She finally came back with drinks...but forgot someone's shake.  Anyway...we ordered appetizers and this was disappointing too. Onion rings were basically super fried batter...and oh yeah...an onion was in there somewhere. Truffle fries were good though. But...still no shake.  We all got different burgers. I got the blue cheese burger...medium.  It showed up and was about 10 seconds from being well done.  Not close to medium at all. Someone else had the same problem and there was no pink in the middle of her burger anywhere. Totally well done. Still no shake for the birthday boy.  Finally, the server said she would comp the shake and the burger. She did replace the well done burger and it came back....eh....medium+. Still not really medium.  Oh..the shake showed up.  The check came...still had the shake on it. We pointed that out and they took it off.  The server was extraordinarily polite and so was the manager. I mean just over the top polite. The kind that comes across not very genuine.  I just wasn't floored by Fox's attempt at a burger place. I didn't dislike it, but I expected a lot.

We live right off of Camelback actually just west of Fashion Square Mall, but Old Town was packed so our son mentioned about Zin Burger.  I thought cool-I know I will get a decent burger there...  Service stunk!  The bartender had no interest in us.  So sad.  I even tried to make conversation with him.  He kept calling me MAM.  UGH!  I was feeling ignored and looked down on so I found myself insecure to a point where I literally tried to start small talk about the other Fox restaurants I have tried out...new to the area...from Chicago...we ask him suggestions and he seems annoyed...we are spoiled living in Chicago, I in the industry, living to experiencing different dining ventures all over the world...and this guy did not even know to bring us a plate each or even silverware for our appetizer that we were sharing!!!  We had to eat it cold because we couldn't even find him to get the plates!    Oh, and then our food was taken from us without even asking us before we were even done with the sauces on the plates!    Well, it is what it is.  Shame on him.  He couldn't even bring us an itemized bill and expected us to just assume we had the right bill amount.  I even questioned it and he literally shrugged his shoulders!!!  Talk about being \"dissed\"!    Please, do not ever treat anyone else like that ever again.

My date and I each ordered a salad. It's a good thing we were both engrossed in conversation. If I had been there by myself waiting for my greens to come out, I probably would have gotten up and left. I would guestimate that it took a good 45 minutes for salad--stuff that doesn't even need to really be cooked---to come out to our table (Ok, I got the seared Ahi tuna salad, but come on, how much actual cooking time is involved??) And the sad thing was, it wasn't even THAT busy, so I don't understand why our order took so long.   The wait was just ridiculous for what we ordered. I could understand if we ordered a rack of lamb (which is not on the menu), but salad? Come on! Somebody is really dropping the ball on the service there.   I don't know who's in charge, but they really need to light a fire underneath their waitstaff.",

I just wish there was one closer to my side of town :(  Alas, when we want a guaranteed good burger experience (a la 'non-fast-food' style), we know here's where it's at.  Plus, who doesn't enjoy having a glass of zin with their burger.. mine certainly paired perfectly.  I had the Zinburger and was *loving* the cheese (I like funky cheeses on my beef), but what stood out the most was the perfectly cooked and moist (and a little pink) patty.  These people know when to stop cooking the patty (unlike some other places I've recently reviewed.. ugh).  My SIL had the same but I had added a few toppings (hence mine was a little more pricey but had much more interesting flavors with every bite).  We decided to split the sweetpot fries.. .oof, so good!  I don't think I'm a fan of their dipping sauce, but I don't need no stinkin' dipping sauce for my fries.. they were well cooked and very plentiful.. enough to share!  We sat outside in the patio area and, though it was busy busy busy (as always), we had good service and the atmosphere was really relaxing and up-beat at the same time.",

Kira served us for happy hour which included half-priced sides and draft beers...perfect. The burger I got was called the slam burger...bacon cheeseburger with 1000 island. It came out in less than 10 minutes in a fairly busy restaurant and Kira served everything with a smile and great attitude.  I could see it being kind of pricy off of happy hour but it's really worth a little extra to have to ambience and high-quality burger. Lastly, upgrade to the Kobe beef...you'll be happy you did.",

We both had Kobe burgers (Samburger and original Burger) with a side of sweet potato fries and lemonade. He says we get refills on all the available lemonades.   Wife got an extra order of avocados. When the burger was brought out, no avocados. Server admitted that he had made a mistake. No biggy. Mine looked good, but it didn't taste that amazing. I had medium grilled.  Then, he comes back after a few minutes and asks to refill the strawberry lemonade. Comes back a minute later: \"Sorry, we only refill plain lemonades.\" Honestly, instead of looking like a cheapo, just get the refill of lemonade YOU had originally suggested. It costs you 5 cents. We're paying $16 dollars a burger and $3 for a drink. Save some face.  Sweet potato fries were small and slightly burned.",

    "text": "With the day off and being in the area, we thought it would be a great opportunity to try Zinburger. Besides, out of town coworkers liked the burgers so much they ate there two nights in a row. Also, most of the Fox Restaurants are usually decent and with their 25% off Labor Day enticement, why not? However, it was a huge disappointment!   We passed True Food on our way to the entrance, which was not busy while Zinburger was bustling. Busy seemed like a good, initial sign. The wait was 20 minutes for a table inside, so we opted to sit outside immediately thinking the misters would help with the heat and that we could avoid the wait, order and eat fast. That was not the way it turned out.   We were seated in the side patio, in direct sunlight and the misters sprayed in the opposite direction. If there was water, that would've helped but it didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered. By that time, we were ready to pass out. The sweet potato and zucchini fries that arrived 15 minutes later, were not bad. Then, 10 minutes later, the burgers arrived.   My order was for a Zinburger cooked to medium.  Once it was cut into half, the meat was red and raw in the middle.  Medium to me is pink, not RED.  Immediately, the bun and condiments got soggy from the greasy, oily juice and fat oozing from the meat patty.  My fingers and nails became soiled from the fluid.  I could not eat the other half since the meat was raw and everything else was soaked in the greasy oil, leaving the most undesirable appearance and texture.  Also, the waiter was so scarce and service so slow, that sending it back was not an option.    This ranks among one of least pleasing burgers ever, and certainly pales in comparison to other burgers eaten in the same price range.  Given that both the food and service experience was so dreadful, we will never dine here again.",

We had about 4 different \"servers\" who didn't seem to know what was going on, unlike at Houston's where multiple servers are seamless. Fries took about 25 minutes to come out, and burgers another 25-30 minutes after that. We were starving by then. It was a Thursday night, and the place was busy, but not packed.",

    "text": "I would give the Tucson Zinburger 5 stars without a second thought.  They are fabulous and it pains me to say bad things about their sister restaurant in beautiful phoenix.  Maybe I would be happier with Biltmore Zinburger if Tucson Zinburger didn't set such high standards to live up to.  I have been here 3 times and my burger has been over cooked every time.  Medium is supposed to be pink all the way through not a faint line of pink in the middle of a brown burger.  I sent it back the first time and it was a huge ordeal so I just delt with it the next two times Ugh.  The Banana Cream Pie at the Tucson location is out of this world.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of eating it in Phoenix because they have been out every time!  Tucson also has these great burger of the day specials but I guess the Phoenix location doesn't do them - they should start!  I was also surprised to find that the Phoenix Zinburger was not very amenable to substitutions.  They wouldn't add strawberries to one of my milk shakes.  Why I do not know.  They wouldn't do a half order of French fries (something I always appreciate in Tucson) and they wouldn't do  1/2 sweet potato fries and  1/2 regular - Zinburger you should do that Delux does!  Will I go back?  Probably because I keep hoping that I will love this one like I love the other one but I will definitely TRY to get my Zinburger fix in when in Tucson.",

    "text": "Seriously, anyone who can give this place less than 5 stars you're either 1.) Only rating the \"ambiance\" not the food 2.) Don't appreciate a great quality burger or 3.) Ordering a damn salad and complaining about it not being top notch at a place that specializes in burgers. This place is hands down mouthwatering! I've alternated between both their regular beef patties and the Kobe beef. There isn't a huge difference but the Kobe beef is definitely juicier! What's great is that their toppings are always fresh. So you'll never get a soggy burger. But it might get messy. That's usually how you know you're eating a great burger though! And their fries? Excellent! You cannot go wrong with getting the double truffle fries or even better? Their loaded fries! These fries are smothered with hot melted white cheddar cheese, sour cream that's lightly drizzled on top, small bits of diced scallions, and topped off with bacon! And I can't leave out the customer service. My boyfriend and I have actually become regulars here and it's always a nice touch when they warmly greet is back and remember us. Staff here is definitely friendly! If this review isn't enough to make you stop by and try this place out, then you'll definitely be missing out!",

Angus beef with a fried egg, avocado, bacon, pickled onion, tomato, lettuce, and mayo all on their perfectly made bun. It was a sloppy mess because of all the topping but what do you expect with that many toppings. The burger came with a half order of fries which I choose the sweet potato fries. At $10 the burger is a steal compared to normal menu pricing. With that many toppings it would've been a $15+ burger. My wife had the Hava Chicken Sandwich which has become her new favorite food! And we split the Zucchini Fries, WOW those things are amazing! Overall everything was fresh and tasted wonderful. Make sure to finish it off with a shake. We split the KitKat Shake, I'm not sure who makes the shakes there but they are a True professional! Perfectly blended and topped with whip cream. It was nothing short of amazing! Service was good, better than whats found in most burger joints but not quite to the scale of other FOX restaurants. But that type of service isn't necessary here, I'm having a burger not a complex pasta, and I'm having a milkshake not a glass of perfectly balanced Cabernet. Anyway All around great things at the Zinburger. Next I'll have to try a salad, maybe...",

    "text": "the first time I went here, my sister and I split each of our burgers so we both got a taste off the turkey burger and samburger,aong with the sweet potato fries. The meat is perfectly cooked, the sauces and aiolis are on point, and those fries cooked in the truffle oil are crazy good! Second time I went to zinburger, I tried their ahi sandwich, with an addition of roasted peppers. Again, they didn't disappoint my taste buds at all. The fish was cooked rare and the peppers, bread, and avocado all complimented the fish. My friend and I split an order of sweet potato fries, and paired with the yogurt dipping sauce, they are the perfect side with their sandwiches and burgers. For dessert, we split banana cream pie. Now, I've never eaten banana cream pie before this and I'm happy I did, because my life would have been incomplete without this experience. The sweet cream, with carmel drizzled over it, the crumbly crust, the perfectly sweet bananas... I might just have to go back just or the pie! They have an extensive choice of shakes, so I might have to accompany my pie with a shake... Which is the perfect recipe for a sugar coma. Along with the delicious food, the atmosphere provides a hip feel, as all the Fox restaurants do, that is comfortable while still feeling sophisticated. The service here is awesome, the young lady who sat was polite and smiley, and our server was eficient and informative when we asked about the menu. If you want a good burger... GO HERE!!!",

The prices are comparable to most other restaurants around that area and honestly people go to McDonald's if you don't want to spend the moolah.   I LOVED it! Coming from someone who used to frequent DELUX, got sick of the same one burger and the fact that the service was rude at the bar.   Tried out this place on Easter with a couple of friends. The waitress was nice and answered all my high maintenance questions. I used to be a waitress so I know how annoying that is! hahaha. I ordered the Kobe (omg 14 dollars!) had it medium and added goat cheese. The Kobe beef is from Washington not California or Japan..so I don't know what that means when it comes to quality. My friend ordered a standard and put Bacon and Eggs on top! We split the Truffle fries and I had a glass of syrah and he hand a Guinness.   I LOVE all the extra topping that you can add..there is a charge but they are nice and happy to put whatever you want on the burger..as opposed to other places.   I ordered the medium, it came out a little more med-rare so if you want a True med I would order a Med-Well. But it was really really good! I ate the whole damn thing! I usually cant finish half! I was amazing! I was super happy with the outcome! And my friend seemed to like his Bacon and Egg burger but I wasn't really paying attention because I was in burger heaven!   After that I washed down my friens and burger with a strawberry shake...it was good but I was so stuffed I couldn't finish that...   The bill came out to $50...for 2 drinks, 2 burgers, fries and a milkshake. For that price I would say date night...but definitely worth trying out!   WAYYYYYYY better the DELUX...and only a mile down the road!",

The meat used in the burger is fresh and high quality and they cook it to your specification.

    "text": "Monday night was a big one for me.  First, after a weekend of cajoling and bartering and promises and pleas, my wife finally relented and allowed me to waste tons of money we don't have on two shiny new iPhones.  So we were at biltmore and were reeling from the precipitous drop in our financial resources and, like the good consumers we are, decided to ease the hurt of one bad decision by hurriedly taking on another one.   So we went to zinburger.  I could fill a book with the rationalizations used to convince myself and others that the iPhone purchase was a sensible one, but for food, all we needed to know was that our son was hungry.   Sooo.  We went here and I am thrilled we did because I have probably never had a more delightful burger ever.  The eponymous burger comes with manchego cheese, which always makes me long for Barcelona, and carmelized onions.  Oh, and the moistest, succulentest, tastiest patty ever.  It was falling apart out of sheer goodness.  The flavor was sublime.   We also got a fruit plate for my son, The One, the Second Coming, and it was a fruit plate worthy of his amazingness.  It had apples, dates, oranges, pomegranates, bananas, caramel sauce... and not a melon in sight.  For $3!!  My wife got the vegetarian burger and looked pleased with it.  Well she actually said she liked it.  It had a tomato marmalade on a black bean patty and after making her forfeit all she knew to be good and right just so I could have my phone, I didn't have the heart to ask for a bite.   Really though, the food was phenomenal.",

They have unique combinations of burger ingredients, and I try to order a different burger every time. They've all been amazing. The zucchini fries are fresh with the perfect amount of breading and sprinkle of parmesan cheese...too much for one person. Get them to share! Don't go into this place expecting fast-casual...it's definitely an eat-in or (call ahead and) pick-up restaurant. The price is a little higher than I usually like to pay for just a burger (you pay separate for a side of fries). But every so often, a splurge on this burger is worth it.",

    "text": "\"It is better to look good, than to serve good. . . \"   First of all, the burgers are very good. I ordered mine medium, and that's how it actually arrived. Not many places will actually cook a burger to order. Maybe they SAY they will, but no. The fries (both sweet potato and regular) were tasty. So no real complaints about the food.  But . . . COME ON Sam Fox. . . you can't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses, have them take far too long to seat us because they couldn't figure out which tables were open, deny that a special was being offered (until I showed the email for it on my phone),  have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine, delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so, repeatedly neglect water and drink refills, forget that the burger was ordered without a bun, and expect customers not to notice because they've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness. I've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food.   So, not really a fan. Maybe caught them on a bad night (though the Tuesday night crowd didn't seem like it would have been too imposing). I might give them another chance, but then if I'm paying $11 for a burger ala carte, basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back. Smashburger and 5 Guys are just down the street, and I'd rather not pay for the pretention of service.",

BARSTAFF-Right off the bat we sat at the bar, in the food for some conversation, that usually comes from the bartenders at any place, however after having two menus thrown down with out anything being said, it started off very unwelcoming. Without the help of , what seemed to be the manager, the bartender girl never said one word to us except\" see ya\" as we got up.( the manager did everthing from take orders and make drinks, but seemed annoyed like she didnt want to be helping the obviously slow bartender)  Chow & Grub- Truffle parm fries were tastly,but take off the top ten fries and it looked like the bottom of the barrel , just crumbs and bits.My guy ordered the Samburger which he devoured,(literally, breathe baby!!) so thumbs up there! I oredered the Roasted chicken salad , that comes with pomagranate seeds and goat cheese. It was delish! I would high highly recommend this.  The Look- standard clean fresh peppy, Fox place, nothing stand out. Clean and fresh. Good looking staff. :)  Break it down Jess- Given the greatness of my salad I want to give this more stars but the bad service and attitude was just too awful. It seems like a fun and fresh( yes I have said that) place and didnt pull its weight with such bad staff. The salad could be gotten elsewhere.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Fox restaurants and I do really like the food at this one. One need only see some of my other reviews of Fox properties.  The only reason I am giving this place only 2 stars is because of my experience last night.  Three of us had dinner there. We all had burgers and shared some sides. Like all specialty burger joints, the burgers are 9-15 bucks and sides are ordered separately. This means it can get a little pricey if all you really want is a great burger and fries. Alone, I would have just gone to The Habit.  Suffice it to say that all of our food was great. Hot, fresh, timely. What put us off was that practically the whole time we were eating, there was a server sweeping under all of the vacant tables around us as well as using her phone flashlight to inspect under the heavy round table bases. God knows WHAT she was looking for?! Roaches? Mice? Errant pickles? I had a similar experience at their flagship store The Henry, one of the many things that earned that Fox place a single star in a review by me. It didn't matter, it was off putting. In fact it may have even been in violation of the health code. When I was in the business in Canada, it was against Food Safe guidelines to sweep any dining area while people are still eating. Why? Because sweeping stirs up dirt into the air which then settles peacefully into your cheeseburger and onion rings, with the remainder settling into your ice tea. This is a huge no no, and it seems Fox employees are always in such a darned hurry to finish their side duties while dinner is still being served. This is so gauche and disgusting I'm surprised their management staff doesn't put a stop to this happening. Perhaps they are rushing the staff out the door to save the $3.00 an hour a server earns in wages? In any case, Fox restaurants needs to re-visit closing duties etiquette, and have the janitorial work be completed once ALL of the diners have paid and left.  I likely won't bother going back to Zin Burger. Delux Burger has better food, is just as close to our house and I have never once been annoyed by a sweeping server while enjoying their delish nosh. Sorry Zin, we're breaking up. It's not me, it's you.",

    "text": "So obviously this place pulls in major business and is rather well regarded by its regulars. I decided to give it a shot, as I am relatively new in Phoenix. I came here with several friends, and we were seated promptly. The waitress was very sweet and attentive...I appreciated her effort in providing quality service.  We ordered sweet fries, onion rings, and truffle fries, to share between 5 people. They were promptly finished. The sweet fries were paired with a tzatziki sauce, which I found to be a rather poor pairing. The fries themselves were decent but nothing special. The onion rings were pretty tasty-- the barbecue sauce they came with was nothing extraordinary. The truffle fries were my favorite, but  the aioli they came with was too rich and not tangy enough. I ordered the blackberry lemonade but i found it to be a bit too sugary.  Our burgers came out within decent time. I decided to go with the Kobe burger. It was definitely excellent-- cooked just right and dripping with juicy goodness. No doubt the quality of the beef likely attributed to the enjoyment. The potato bun was ever so crunchy and melted in my mouth at just the right moments. I'm a sucker for the main entree, so if its good, my review usually ends up as a good review. I left quite satisfied and wouldn't mind coming back.",

The inside was pretty noisy so I'm glad we got to sit outside.  The decor of the place is pretty weird/different but I guess that's what people want.  Our waitress was helpful and friendly and my diet coke refills came quickly.  Our party split the Roasted Chicken Salad without the chicken.  It was interesting and pretty good.  Not really enough to share with 4 people though.  I don't understand why this place doesn't have just regular side salads.  Both the Zinburger and the Kobe burger were top noch.  The patties were fresh, juicy and cooked perfectly.  They were decently sized as well.  Not really worth $10+, but I can deal with it because they were good.  The sweet potato fries were very good.  Not oily or mushy.  I did not enjoy the yogurt sauce stuff because it was just a weird combination.  I loved loved loved the double truffle fries though.  I could eat an entire basket of those things by myself.  I thought the zucchini fries were just 'eh.  I think they lacked flavor and should have been a bit more crunchy.

The other was just okay, not bad, but nothing to write home about.   Let's get to the food! OMG the burgers are amazing! I have had the Kobe burger and the Zin burger. I thought both were equally good. I could not tell much of a difference between them. Zinburger actually cooks a burger medium if you ask them to! Sometimes it seems some places ask you your preference and still cook it well done. Not Zinburger.   I had the handcut fries which were pretty good. Have not had a chance to try any of the others.

All good choices. Also, not a huge fan of shredded lettuce. The zucchini fries are super tasty and my sister really liked her BLT salad. We ended up there for lunch on Friday and if we hadn't found seats at the bar it would have been a 30-minute wait. The bar service was surprisingly attentive. We decided it would probably be a good spot to watch a game, too. For a Fox restaurant, this place could be better.

    "text": "Recently returned to Zinburger with my Foodie brother and felt prompted to write this review because he insists that the Kobe Burger is one of the best (if not, THE BEST) he's ever tasted...and he's been EVERYWHERE. Granted, he orders it rare, with a strange mixture of mozzarella, swiss, bacon and extra tomatoes but to see the look on his face when he's eating it (we've been here a few times now), it's well worth the $15-18. As for me, I've been here MANY times since they first opened and I absolutely love their Turkey Burger (I get it with avocado, bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce) or Clint's \"Almost Famous\" Vegetable Burger - $9 with Smoked Mozzarella, Tomato Marmalade (but I hold the mayo; not needed). I love them both. Always perfectly prepared.  Oh, and a word about BUNS: they are placeholders IMHO so I don't like them to overpower the burger. In other words, they shouldn't be too thick or heavy and the taste shouldn't draw attention to itself and Zinburger's buns don't. They look thick but they're actually light and squishy so I can get my mouth around the burger with no problem. All the fries are great, I rotate between the sweet potato and the zucchini style. The banana cream pie is wonderful, as long as it comes out READY... Unfortunately, on more than one visit, we were given a pie slice that hadn't had time to set-up and was running all over the plate. Yuck. That should never happen. Management and wait staff should know better. The only disappointment I've experienced with Zinburger is their shakes. I think the ice cream they use is awful. My family has tried almost every one on the menu (with vanilla and chocolate variations) and not one has gotten ordered a second time. That's a shame, but in a way, I don't mind because I really don't need the calories anyway...especially if I'm saving room for Banana Cream Pie!",

    "text": "Ahh the Biltmore, where non rich white people go to pretend to be rich (seriously all of my laughs are gone by the end of this), the wait staffs acts the exact same. Okay let me take this back a minute, you walk inside and it's a f-ing putrid smell of raw meat, of course because it's open kitchen. Disgusting. They cook the burgers one temperature under the temperature you actually ordered. They ask to bring the fries out first because they're actually \"hot\" then, even though they're cold...? I know confusing to me as well. The wait staff has an inability to re-fill drinks. This isn't even the worst part. It was my 16th birthday and I got home and started uncontrollably puking till my jaw hurt and eyes turned blood shot red. I went to urgent care, and found out I had mono, with Botulism as the cherry on top. I was hospitalized for four weeks due to complete Botulism symptoms (slurred speech, no saliva, no oxygen the works), and Mono (fevers high grade, very very weak, low blood pressure, red puffy eyes, and again labored breathing). I'm so done with Fox Resteraunt Concepts, their pretentious wait staff is forever a problem but hospitalization for something I could've died from, because of someone's  careless mistake.",

    "text": "Ate at Zinburger 9/24 with my wife and two friends who re-located from Milwaukee.  Since I had never contemplated mixing beer and ice cream I had to satisfy my curiosity and started the evening with the Black Lager Float - that's right - an ice cream float made with a dark black lager.  Where has this cocktail / dessert been all my life!  Zinburger is a la carte and be spendy (which is to say I don't know if it would work in my beloved hometown of Milwaukee).  We got one order of each of the four types of fries - loved the sweet potato fries (with yogurt dipping sauce) and the zucchini fries (with parmesan and ranch)  I ordered the Samburger - Nueske's bacon, american cheese and thousand island dressing.  The meat was flavorful and cooked perfectly, the bun was fresh, warm and had some \"puffiness\" to it - Nueske's makes everything perfect and this burger was no exception.  The decor of the place was simple and casually elegant and the vibe was energetic.  Definitely a fun and tasty night!",

I got the Zinburger and hand-cut fries but something still seems odd about paying $10 for a hamburger. P.S.    There is a trick to parking here, you need to go to the parking area with the gates and push a button to get a coin which you take inside the restaurant and get validated.    Overall I'm a fan and I'll be back someday.",

    "text": "I'm adding one star for the desserts only, although I still think the shakes are priced too high. You don't even get an overflow cup like at most places. $6 per shake.   Anyhoo, we went there for dessert last night and I got a slice of banana cream pie that could have fed a small army, and husband got the double-cocolate mint shake concoction.   My pie was fabulous: real bananas, creamy filling, crunchy graham cracker crust, and mounds of whipped cream topped with caramel sauce. ooooooo yum! $5 for a giant slice.   Husband said the shake was really good. Not mind-blowing.   We'll stick with the desserts here after we've eaten better burgers somewhere else!",

A friend got the veggie burger and wasn't impressed (fell apart quickly) but I've loved every burger I've tried and they feature a special burger each week (which makes it easy to come back often). The shakes are good, and huge, so I recommend splitting one (they'll even divide it for you). Overall a definite thumbs up.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I'm generally a big Fox Restaurant fan. I was excited to try Zinburger and finally got there with some friends. I split a turkery burger, sweet potato fries and the chocolate mint milkshake with a friend.   Let's start with my favorite part of the meal - the milkshake! It was amazing and delicious and I'd certainly order this again (probably one for just me though!).   My next favorite dish were the fries - perfectly done with the right amount of crunch and softness. They come with a yogurt dipping sauce - it's fine but completely unnecessary.   Sadly, my least favorite part of the meal was the turkey burger. It was boring! It had no flavor except for the avocado on top. Where were all the great seasonings?!   I'll try this place again, but would hope for more in the burgers when it's in the name.",

    "text": "Zin Burger is a good spot for lunch, assuming you don't mind dining in an outdoor mall.  Food was pretty good, with burgers and fries being the main point of focus of course.   Burgers aren't anything to write home about, but get the job done.  Fish sandwich and veggie burger were okay -- kind of what you'd expect to get at a chain restaurant.  The truffle fries were over truffled to the point of being kind of gross.  A decent beer selection was a plus.   The black eye for the place was the service.  Our waitress (who must have barely been 18) promoted savignon blanc from Spain (maybe that exists somewhere, but not on their wine list) and food was coming out undercooked (meaning raw chicken) to tables around us.  Multiple members of the staff told us our food was on its way out, which it wasn't (we were a four top at lunch on a sat -- weird).",
