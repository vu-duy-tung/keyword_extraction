This morning I had an $8 omlette meal special and asked for a waffle in addition. The waffle was priced at $5.50... is that normal for a waffle? Seems steep.  Nonetheless it remains my breakfast place of choice.",

Their prices are incredible! Please note cash or check only.",

Salads are huge, and fresh; sandwiches are the same!  The breakfasts are second to none, and offers every breakfast item combination you could ever ask for.  The pies?  Boom!  Ice-cream?  Boom.  Bathrooms?  Boom-ish.  Service?  Seriously, everyone here loves their job.  This must be a huge testament to why Randy's has been around for so long in Scottsdale!  Here's the next \"tip\" - I don't know what type of \"chef magicians\" they have in the kitchen to make such wonderful dineresque dishes, but (1) it comes out ridiculously fast; and (2) HOT HOT HOT HOT!  If you've read any of my other reviews, you know I like food hot (that is supposed to be hot).  This place is an absolute historic gem and legend.  No fuss, reasonably priced, huge quantities, expansive menu, the best service ever.  EVER.  Randy's, I love you.",

This is such a typical coffee shop I was thrown back to going out to lunch with my grandmother and her friends. I got such a kick out of the nostalgia. Was seated by a pleasant lady and was immediately greeted by the server who returned with my iced tea quickly. I ordered the BLT w/avocado (in my world, a bad BLT can kill a coffee shop) I had a very nice choice of breads, and was asked if I wanted the mayo on the sandwich since the avo was on it. (Yes-Are you kidding?!lol) I think that plate hit my table within THREE minutes, I kid you not. The French fries were SCREAMING HOT! (Fantastic!) Sandwich was very good with lots of filling and the bread was well toasted. Lots of checking back by my server, and refills of my glass.   The things that really dropped the score here were the approach to the restroom, which was covered with dirty trash on the floor, and the sticky vinyl seats.  Small things but still significant. I would go back, but maybe not dressed like I was, and just enjoy a True old style coffee shop.",

Decor was dated too but clean and comforting.  I just felt right away that I was in a very welcoming place for some good diner food.  For the first time in awhile it felt like my server was someone who enjoyed working as a server, meeting people, and we felt like our business was actually appreciated.  Wow, novelty.    I looked for an explanation for why it was too good to be True, perhaps it was because it was a slower period between breakfast and lunch on a weekday.  Food was served very hot, fast, and was good for breakfast diner food. The check was so low that I couldn't just leave the standard % range because it would have been insufficient.  Cash only place, and will surely go here again for a nice two egg breakfast with friendly service.",

Food is pretty good. The servers are nice but when we went to pay the ladies at the front were less than pleasant. Asked a question about the ice cream having egg and the rude blonde lady just kept saying \"It's Dryers.\" Which I understood but does it have egg? She proceeded to check me out hastily and said \"I have no idea.\" I get it, you guys are old school but you should really know what you're selling! Especially with all the allergies people have now. I wanted to bring my nephew back for ice cream but he has a severe egg allergy; now I don't know if I will since it's so hard to get info out of the people serving the ice cream! Go in the back and read your ingredients. You weren't that busy to do so in the first place!",

The only comment that may be negative is I found the meatloaf sauce a bit salty for my taste. It may be good for everyone else but I just found it a bit on saltier side.

Sat in a booth and the real reason for the 5 stars showed up. My waitress. Super welcoming and she made me feel at home. I could tell from being in the business that all the wait staff was warm and professional and paying attention. I grew up in upstate NY and i felt like i was back there. Real and friendly people who are looking at you and not thinking about texting someone.  I had the California Omelette with home-style potatoes bagel with cream cheese, side of bacon and coffee. All were good.  I took my time and left knowing i would be back again tomorrow and a few other times while i am here on business.  Sometimes i forget how much a welcoming experience can add to a meal. So nice to have that when being alone out of town on business.  I also watched the interactions with all the other customers and saw that the customer was #1 . I eat out a lot in my travels and this level of attention is rare. Randy's is an experience not just a good meal....i recommend you go have your own. Can you tell i liked it there :-)",

I feel like if I came here often enough everyone would really know my name. Great family owed vibe and the staff was all super friendly and on top of there game!!   The food came out super fast and was DELICIOUS!! I was sooo shocked at the quality of the food we received. You can tell it was fresh and the portions were larger than expected!

While I have only had breakfast foods there, I have only had great experiences. I am a food snob- very picky! But I gotta tell you everything from the quality, service, and speediness-it's all on point!   I am now a \"regular\" and I have my \"usual\" meal of western skillet sub the ham for crispy bacon with a sesame bagel butter on the side (that is if they don't run out of sesame!!) I call my order in and it is ready in 5 mins every time! Don't miss out on those potatoes they are amazing! For first timers I would suggest a skillet, the Randy's breakfast, or the hulk breakfast (part of their healthy menu options).   It wouldn't be an honest review if I didn't say what I'm not a fan of: Skip out on the iced coffee and just order an iced tea- I am not only a food snob but a coffee addict as well! Also wish they had heaters for the outside seating. But for someone like me who can complain about everything, my list of downfalls for Randy's is really short!!   Know that this place is old school- cash or check only. ATM machine inside in case you forget this. I love the people here so much I made them a cake for the holidays (along with my starbucks baristas!) If that doesn't tell you how nice they are, go see for yourself and enjoy!!",

Once I opened the menu i realized why the prices are cheap and the menu vast.  For some reason I felt like breakfast for dinner but they dont serve it at night , no problem the menu is huge.  I ordered the cobb salad  When it came i was not impressed at first glance it seemed a little small but it had all the right ingredients. It was the first bite i found out this place is full because they use great ingredients fresh lettuce avocado even the bacon bits were fresh.   If you want some really good American style food I would recommend this to anyone in the neighborhood.",

We went on a Sunday after church and it was packed (20 min wait at 10:15). The place itself is locked in 1984 with lots of mauve and pink.  Our waitress was friendly but very harried.  We pretty much needed to ask each time for soda, coffee, or water refills.  The breakfast items are a bargain and it is hard to spend more than $10 on anything for breakfast.  The problem I had was with lunch items.  My Hot Mess burger was nicely grilled but lacked any real taste from the pepper jack or chipotle ranch dressing.  The Southwest salad was wet and overloaded with dressing and came with flavorless chicken.  If you go stick to breakfast or be prepared for a lack of taste.",

My step dad explained that he and his family had been coming here for years and it's really good diner food also known for their pies.  The restaurant doesn't look like it's ever been renovated..very pink and 60s vibes. But it wasn't a bad thing, it totally added to the vibe of a truly classic diner. We were seated immediately and chose to dine on the patio since I had my small dog with me. The waiters were friendly and made suggestions on what to eat.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. It was very tasty, I think stuffed with blue cheese and lettuce and tomato.   My fiance had the messy burger on sourdough. It was really good but not messy at all.  My stepdad had the chicken salad sandwich on croissant. It looked bomb.  In addition to the yummy food and great service, I was impressed by how reasonably priced everything was. Much less expensive than anything you could get in LA for that quality. If I lived in Scottsdale id be there all the time!",

On my first visit I wanted to try a few different things so I ordered the half sandwich combo with grilled turkey, coleslaw, and a scoop of ice cream. I thought everything was great and what was even better was the service here which is just incredible. All the servers and waitresses were extremely friendly and nice. It looks like a lot of people that dine in here are seniors and you could tell that at least some of them are regulars here. I can see why they choose to come back as they're treated with great care.  This place is cash only and I noticed that they also do take out as well. I'll probably be back here soon to try out some of their other options on the rather extensive menu. Their daily specials look great too.",

We both had the special of the day and because it sells quickly they were busy changing the blackboard a few times while we were there. I had the chicken parm with spaghetti and garlic bread, a salad to start and a slice of heavenly chocolate cream pie, all for a bargain price of around $12.00. Hubby went with the pork chop special, applesauce and scalloped potatoes along with soup and ice cream for dessert. Same price! While the clientele was older we didn't mind that a bit as the food is fresh, the atmosphere that of a great diner and the wait staff friendly and efficient. I definitely want to go back for breakfast some time and highly recommend them for a good meal at a good price.",

I don't even read the paper while I'm there, although I might like to if I didn't feel so rushed.  This morning I noticed a sign that says \"During our busy times, please do not conduct your business meetings, studying..\" I can't remember the rest but I found it offensive.  I can understand that they don't want people taking up a table when paying customers are waiting. I totally get that.  However, the place is huge and I've never waited for a table.   Perhaps if the wording was different. If people are hanging out, aren't they spending money? Even if they're drinking coffee?  Maybe the patio could be self service so waiters don't have to miss out on customers.   It totally rubbed me the wrong way and it's plastered as soon as you walk in the door.

Every time I drive by, I look in and see crowds enjoying themselves; especially around 4:30 for the early bird special. But can you blame a place located in the heart of old town for having some retirees on their list of regulars? I can't. In fact, I applaud Randy's. Apparently the old timers know what's up.   Let me be truthful here. Randy's is just a diner. It's your everyday, run of the mill, All American neighborhood diner...and it's awesome. Walking in on a Saturday morning at 9:30, the place was jam packed with folks of all ages. The staff quickly greeted us and scurried us to an open table while keeping a smile on their face. Looking around, guests looked like they were having a good time. Whether it was the group of partiers who needed some grease to settle their hangover or the retirees on the run from Sun City andd taking a morning walk to get breakfast and coffee, I saw just about every type of person at Randy's.   Now let me get to the menu. I am pretty sure that not a thing on the breakfast menu exceeds $6.00. Slowly but surely, Scottsdale's losing this trait of economically priced meals so I salute Randy's for keeping the prices down. Now on to star number two in my book of Randy's cuisine. Do you ever go to a restaurant for breakfast and think...I'd really like an egg but I'm also craving a pancake or french toast, but I don't want nor do I need a full order of carbs. I do all the time. I love pancakes and I love french toast, but there's a rare occasion when I actually order that as my main entree for a meal. Enter Randy's. In their 20+ breakfast combination choices, they offer options like \"one egg, one piece of bacon, and a half order of french toast\" or the same but with a pancake instead. When I read this, my heart skipped a beat for Randy wherever he is. And let me also mention that this meal is around $4.50. Can't beat that!   The food itself was just what the doctor ordered. It tasted homemade, with flavor and it was just the right amount of food. Now don't walk in expecting The Food Network to feature Randy's, but if you want a solid breakfast at a decent price, this is your spot. But buyer beware. They only accept cash or checks. Better bring some cash because if you are under the age of 60, I highly doubt you're walking around with a check book and if you lack both, you'll be slapped with a $3 ATM fee. That's nearly the price of the meal!   So until next time Randy's. With a six (?) page menu chock full of everything imaginable in small town USA dining, I think I have my hands full getting through it!",

So I can only attest to its greatness. Many stories through the years of only ordering spaghetti (regardless of the hour or occasion).   Mrs. Randy always decorates the restaurant in seasonal and holiday themes and it makes me giggle. It is very cute, especially with all the old folks who fit in with the Hallmark style. And the 90s interior is fantastic. Yes please to salmon-pink, off-white, and turquoise.   The service is always good. Lots of new servers still learning every time I have been lately.   Randy man is a win.",

The waitstaff could be members of your own family and always make our little 15 month old smile.  The price for what you get is amazing and they have wonderful seasonal specials (try the pumpkin grain cakes, YUMMY!).  The service may be quick, but the food is quick too and the menu can be described in two words.  Comfort food.  If you're looking for a low cost, highly delicious mom & pop restaurant where you'd swear your mom was in the kitchen I'd check this place out.  Just remember.  They only accept cash or check.  Don't plan to pay with plastic.",

    "text": "I have hesitated before to give not so great reviews to places, especially when they seem to be a valley institution and they are family run, however the whole reason we use Yelp is to help us make decisions on where we want to spend our hard earned money.  When dealing with any situation that has both good and bad points I always take the bad first.  Here it goes: Even though the staff was friendly I was giving only a spare few minutes to scan the menu before the waitress was back asking for my order.  I was a server for years and it is bad form to ask someone for their order while the menu is still open in their hand and it is obvious they are reading it.  When I asked for some more time, it was given to me but I felt it was somewhat reluctantly which lead to feeling more rushed.  So I rushed and ordered something so stupid and the moment my order was out of my mouth I regretted it, tacos.  I know, horrible!  I don't know what I was thinking, I was hungry, only a granola bar was eaten to satiate my hunger hours ago. Taco Bell is better, these had very little meat, one was so scarce I wasn't sure if the meat was left off until I bit into it.  The meat iself left the tacos sitting in a pile of grease, gross.  The only toppings were a sprinkling of lettuce and smidge of cheese.  They brought tabasco to the table and when  I asked for tapatio or cholula I was brought sriracha.  Finally I got some hot sauce that I didn't recognize the name but it was spicy enough. The taco shells were store bought and stale, ugh. Basically I thought I would write it off on a bad choice but the bottom line to me is if you have it on your menu it should be good.  I have hesitated in writing negative reviews for other places because I have decided for one reason or another to try it again before I review it.  Even though this place is cheap I know I won't go back there again, hence this review. Oh yes, I also think it is pretty lame to have an establishment that size and this day and age  letting you pay cash only.  The ATM in the front charges a fee, I wonder who gets to pocket that fee?",

    "text": "Ever since my daughter went gluten-free we've been searching for the perfect spot for our traditional after-church family breakfast. We found it at Randy's!  From the moment we walked in the door the service was impeccable. Our first visit was on St Patricks Day and the place was packed. That did not hinder their customer service one bit. Everyone was cheerful and helpful and it had a fun, \"everyone knows your name\" atmosphere.  Once we were seated our server took our drink order right away and returned with our drinks before we could even decide what we were going to eat. She remained this attentive the entire time.  Now, I am a bit of a blueberry pancake snob and like my pancakes just right- soft and chewy, not too thick or bread-like. Randy's aces the test! Yummy!   As for value, you definitely get your monies worth. Their omelettes come with toast and potatoes but you can upgrade the toast to pancakes, which we did since we like to share. The kids meals are all of $4.25 and include drinks so you're not paying an arm and a leg for your kids to have juice with their meal.  Our total bill for 5 people was around $34 - very reasonable.  Did I mention that they have fresh brewed passion fruit iced tea? It sounds silly but I am also a tea snob and was giddy when I found great service and great food plus my favorite tea, all in the same place.  Overall Randy's is a great place for a family meal. We can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "I recently moved to a neighborhood very near Randy's in June. Randy's was my go to place for breakfast 2-3 times a week until a week ago. The food is good quality diner food, prices are reasonable, and the wait staff very friendly. What's not to like you ask? I went to breakfast last week with my mother-- our weekend ritual.  I ordered the farm skillet and asked the waiter to tell the chef I was very sensitive to onion and to please try not to accidentally mix onion in my skillet. The reason I made the request is on two prior occasions having ordered the mini omelet, onion was mixed in with the other ingredients I had requested. On those occasions, I did not send back the food, I chalked it up to my not in the first instance explaining I can not eat onion. Thereafter, on every occasion, I made a special request to ensure there was no onion. This strategy worked well for several months. Until last week. Upon receiving my skillet, I took two bites and bit into an onion. When the waiter stopped by our table, I told him I was sorry I could not eat the order as I had just bit into an onion. I did not feel bad sending the order back as I had expressly asked for no onion upon ordering. The waiter said he would have to talk to Randy the owner about this. I said OK. After a few minutes Randy came over to the table with a new skillet meal. I thanked him. Randy then proceeded with the following: \"I personally asked them to cook the meal separate the first time. I had to throw out your meal. WHEN WE SAY THERE ARE NO ONIONS IN SOMETHING, THERE ARE NO ONIONS! I WILL NOT DO THIS AGAIN. CONSIDER THIS YOUR WARNING!\" Randy was red in the face and extremely angry. Needless to say, both my mother and I were shocked by this reaction. I frankly was so taken aback I didn't say anything in response. We ate our meal and afterwards commented that his behavior was so rude we could never go back again. In thinking about what Randy said about cooking the meal separate, I can only surmise he was talking about the grill, however, based on past experience, I believe what is happening is the onions are next to either the container of cheese, mushroom or tomato as these are the other ingredients I have ordered in the past and in the course of getting these other ingredients out, the onions have inadvertently been mixed in. Anyway, if you have an allergy or aversion to onions, or do not wish to be treated in such an abrasive manner by the owner,  you may wish not to frequent this establishment.",

Not with the hair I found in my steak and eggs last Saturday but with your heartless, corporate policies. Randy's, remember the days when you were independent and cared about your reputation? Remember when the customer was usually right and when things went wrong that meant making it right?  Yes, I found a hair in my food. But I'm no prude. I realize that can happen anywhere. And does. But your refusal to do anything but replace the food sans hair is forcing me to leave you. Forever. Yes, I talked my feelings through with the waitress, then the manager, and then Randy himself. But my head shouldn't have to spin off my shoulders to get a $8 refunded to me and a meal replaced for the inconvenience of a hair in my food.  So I bid you a fond farewell, Randy's. I've had good meals and so-so meals in your humble restaurant, but I have to draw the line. And I'm drawing it at poor management. Love 'em or leave 'em the saying goes. And I'll be sure not to the let the door hit me in the bum on the way out.  Love, me.",

I like that there is an extensive menu but the charm is that you can just tell the waitress what you want and they can produce it for you in less than a minute. Small town feel in a big city with a fast-food restaurant order elegance. If you don't like to cook your own scrambled eggs, this is a good option for you. I wouldn't expect any fancy omelets or ingredients and presentation is unnecessary (it would just slow the food down which comes out very quickly).   I was turned off by the hostess that can't say hi while taking your name. I know its busy and the service is fast, fast, fast (they are fast) but say Hi and Good Morning, its just polite. Remember, small town feel, big city?   I don't like sitting down when the tip is still on the table from the last guest. I know that I am not the only person going to sit at that table but it feels like the table didn't get a good break between guests. The table was wiped clean but still, make it feel like it is ready for a new customer. I also found a hair in my food, an eyelash. I think it could have been mine, yes, I am going to say it's mine, probably fell out when I blinked after I ordered and my food arrived. Too bad, I don't eat as fast because it was obvious that we needed to get out, out, out for the next customer.",

How people say it's the best in Scottsdale....I think they haven't been to many of the places in town.  A Swanson dinner would be better than the Sunday Special with roast  1/4 of a chicken covered with yellow premixed, tasteless gravy, green beans from a can or frozen and over cooked, and the stuffing, I gave some of the stuffing to my husband; he took one bite and put it in his napkin.  This food is worse than dorm or hospital food.....maybe equal.  The only thing that was decent is the ice cream that they buy.  Thank goodness.  For those of you who have a heart or kidney condition and are on a salt free, or tasteless diet, and are on a tight budget, and don't feel like cooking, this place is for you!  You'd be better off getting a frozen dinner or food from Safeway vs eating here!",

In the last few months I've been here like, 4-5 times. I've had a couple different omelettes, the breakfast sandwich, and the breakfast burrito (maybe something else I'm not remembering?). Everything is pretty solid. I like that you get a choice of either hashbrowns OR breakfast potatoes with your meal.   Like others have said, Randy's will have your order ready FAST. Almost, scary fast. No matter how busy they seems to be, and no matter how many people I've been here with I'm not kidding when I say most orders have come to the table within about 5 minutes. The servers here are also all extremely friendly. It seems likes there's a lot of regulars here (one of the guys I've come here with a couple times is). Also, the breakfasts are pretty cheap.   I'm sure most of the reviews mention this, but Randy's is also one of the few places around that's cash only. The do have an ATM in the restaurant though.",

Yes, they are super quick, but this is because nothing is really fresh. The chicken was probably cooked a couple days ago and just thrown on the grill for a few seconds. Super dry and no taste. They don't use any kind of flavouring or spices.  I tried various dishes from breakfast to lunch and nothing was good. Wouldn't complain if this would have been a $4 lunch, but a burrito for 10 with soaked cold fries isn't just doing it for me. Sorry, won't go here again, there are just too many good choices around to put that kind of bad food in my body and even paying for it",

As I've said in so many of my reviews, it is service that makes a GREAT restaurant and this server clearly enjoyed her job and seemed to have done it for a while.  She greeted many of the regulars by name and made everyone feel welcome. It was clear she wanted everyone's day to start out great!  We arrived shortly after 7 on a Saturday and got seated in a booth right away. By 7:30 this place was really filling up including a whole youth baseball team of about 20 or so 16 year olds.  Our pleasant waitress took our order and our food was on the table in about the time it takes to make it through a fast-food drive through on a busy day. They serve all the classic diner breakfast items and I particularly liked the fried home style potatoes. We had eggs and has brown too -all done how you expect  Note: this place is CASH Only so be sure to stop at the atm before you drop in. You will be glad you did.",

Randy of Randy's is normally overseeing the operation of this establishment and he is quick to make sure it runs smoothly. By no means is he just looking, he is working also but with a sharp eye on everything.  That was just breakfast, let's move on to lunch. Remember the good old days of the \"blue plate special?\" Well, they don't exactly call it that there, it is just a great group of choices from meatloaf to \"you name it.\" The pies are great and the cinnamon rolls are awesome. (Better get there early if you want a Cinnamon Roll)  The ice cream selection and desert combinations are reminiscent of the old ice cream shops from yesteryear and will bring a smile to young and old.  Dogs are welcome on the patio and they quickly bring a bowl of water for Fido are allowed but   Randy's is the favorite of all of my out of town guests.

    "text": "You Take Your Chances Here...GREAT BASIC BREAKFAST, Otherwise So-So Cafeteria Quality Food.  I have been eating at Randy's off and on for several years now. I just want to temper the reviews with some reality about what to expect...  Initially I ate breakfast only, and generally the same item, #8 (2 eggs, two bacon or sausage, hash brown or country potatoes, and toast). They learned to cook my eggs perfectly, my bacon crispy, and my country potatoes crisp and with onions (the hash browns are tasteless and not crisp at all). I also occasionally enjoyed Randy's Breakfast, substituting a waffle for the short stack of pancakes. I tried the chicken fried steak and eggs, but the chicken fried steak was soggy (not crisp) and pretty tasteless, and I tried their corned beef hash, which was very salty and tasted canned. That was easily solved by sticking to my favorites, which have been consistently excellent.  Morning service was always GREAT! They have wonderful staff, ALWAYS make you feel welcome, and work to ensure that your order comes out correctly and QUICKLY. They are super fast and super attentive!    That said, as long as I stuck to my familiar breakfast items, I was on very safe and tasty terrain.   Fast forward to my more recent experiences since older (much) friends of mine have encouraged me to venture beyond breakfast at Randy's.   I haven't had anything from their lunch or dinner menu that was better than average - at best - but often sub par. I'll give them props on their mashed potatoes, but the commercial gravy is awful, and I can't speak well of anything else except that their seasonal daily specials are only $5.50, and that buys a great deal of forgiveness for so-so cafeteria quality food.  If you are not that picky, you will be fine, but there is nothing remarkable for which to be here after breakfast unless you just want to fill up.   I don't object to the lack of ambiance - the staff more than makes up for it - service trumps all. I also have no quarrel at all with their cash policy. It isn't as if Randy's is pretentious. I wouldn't compare lunch and dinner here to home cooked food, unless you expect food overcooked, and a great deal of the home pantry to be filled with processed ingredients.  After such great breakfasts, I was seriously let down by the rest of the menu.  I'll continue to return for the things that I love, and leave it at breakfast.",

A special every night for just $5.50. A long counter so if you are eating alone it is quick and comfortable. If feels like a small hometown diner. Reminds me of the Bakery and Coffee shop in the little southern Minnesota town I grew up in.  Great Eggs Benedict selection on weekends and mornings.  NO CREDIT CARDS or DEBIT CARDS. Bring your cash! They do have an ATM inside the door if you forget.",

I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table on the weekend, even during their busiest times. It's the kind of restaurant you go to that makes you feel right at home and leaves you smiling.   I've only gone for breakfast but it's my boyfriends go-to spot whenever his dad is in town visiting. They love the place and now I do too. It's incredibly affordable and the meal sizes are big. I usually get their standard breakfast, bacon, eggs over medium, toast, and hashbrowns. YUM. The hot coffee that keeps on giving is that traditional cup of joe you look for in a spot like this.   I'm not going to lie, it's not fancy, it's not going to be 5-star restaurant food, but if you're looking for a heartwarming, welcoming place, that will be nice to your wallet and fill your belly, then this is the place for you!",

We got there around 6:30 p.m. and it was fairly busy. In our mid-forties we felt like we were bringing the average age down significantly. OK, we can live with that. Second observation, welcome to the 80s. Its all pink banquettes and turquoise tabletops, with Scottsdale all being about looks and trends this seemed weird.  Our waitress was great. No complaints there. She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Service was quick and friendly.   We ordered the lasagna special and an egg salad sandwich. The lasagna came with a salad, which was delivered in a little ice cream dish cup. Cute! The lasagna came with garlic bread.  Part of the lasagna was burnt and covered up with sauce (Yuk). The egg salad sandwich was OK.  Also ordered dessert. We ordered the lemon meringue pie and cookies and cream ice cream. The lemon meringue pie was a huge disappointment. The \"lemon\" part of the pie was pasty and had zero lemon flavor. We had assumed the ice cream was home made but when paying we noticed it was just Dryers.   When we checked out we noticed a sign that they accept cash and check only. We did not notice the small sign posted upon entering because it was hidden behind people waiting to pay. There is indeed an ATM with a $3 charge right by the register. How incredibly convenient.  When waiting about 8 minutes to pay we noticed a bunch of signs at the entry  that they are not seating incomplete parties, not wanting anyone to sit there to work or do homework, etc.... Seemed super unfriendly.   So, in wrap-up; the food was mediocre, the service was great, but the method of payment and rather unwelcome signs do not warrant for a return.  NEED TO ADD THIS TO MY REVIEW (DAY AFTER ORIGINAL 5/20 POST). SO THE NO DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD POLICY FORCES YOU TO USE THE ATM AT THE CHECK OUT (BECAUSE WHO CARRIES CHECKS ANYMORE). THE ATM STATES THERE IS A $3 FEE. TODAY I CHECK MY BANK ACCOUNT AND THERE IS A $3 FEE AND A $2.50 FEE FROM THE ATM ON MY STATEMENT (NOT A FEE FROM MY BANK, THEIR ATM MACHINE). SO MY $20 DINNER ENDED UP COSTING ME $29.50 CENTS ($4 TIP AND $5.50 IN BANK FEES). A RESTAURANT THAT IS TOO CHEAP TO ACCEPT DEBIT OR CREDIT CARDS BUT THEN FORCES YOU TO USE THEIR ATM WHICH THEY SUPPOSEDLY NOT HAVE A STAKE IN GUARANTEES I WILL NEVER RETURN. FEELING TOTALLY RIPPED OFF.",

Speed - I have never spent more than 30 minutes in this place and have often dined in 20 minutes.  Phenomenal!  Price - One of the cheapest breakfasts around even compared to IHOP, Denny's, and Coco's.  For the people complaining about cash only - step away from your credit cards, I promise it will be ok.

    "text": "It was February 10, decades ago and I was just getting out of Phoenix Baptist Hospital after being diagnosed with a degenerative kidney disease.  My parents were staying at a nearby hotel, ready to take me back home. Not because of my ailment, but because of my involvement with that \"woman.\"  As soon as I got to my apartment, I found my things all packed up, and my parents about to lecture me on my future, and how it needs to be preserved for both mine and my family's benefit. They didn't want anything or anyone causing any embarrassment and tarnishing their good name.  I asserted my desire to continue seeing this \"woman.\" They threatened to take everything away. I left car keys, safe deposit box key, and apartment key and walked out the door - and I never once looked back as to what could've become of my life.  The next day (Feb 11), my wife picked up her $120+ paycheck (which was all the money we had in the world at that time), and we drove to the Mesa Wedding Chapel and spent $100 getting married. I had to borrow a 1967 Chevy Malibu to get there from the only friend that I had that didn't think I was insane to marry her.  There was no one else in attendance, except for us, the minister, and the cheesy organist. But, that is all whom we needed. I felt at that time that even though I had lost everything (inheritance, apt, school, Amex CC, weekly stipend, car, clothes, family, friends, etc); I actually gained everything!  We ate at the only place we could afford - Swensen's Ice Cream Parlor around 40th st and Thomas. That was our wedding reception and lunch / dinner.  Fast Forward decades later, and we've been married all this time, put 3 kids through college and 1 finishing up in another year. I've been part of 3 startups, and working on my 4th. We've started our Non-Profit, and have benefited so many people all these years that we have lost count of the Thank You's.   We started with nothing and no one to cheer us on. In fact, except for 1 person, everyone said we would fair miserably. Hence, my zero lack of care for any detractors and naysayers - personae non grata as far as I am concerned. I won't even validate these people with a response.  Now, we eat out 7 days a week, most weeks, and we can dine anywhere we please.  So, why are we eating at this cheap diner on our anniversary?  Because, it's one of the few remaining Ice Cream Parlor, and it seemed like such a nice diner. Having read all the reviews. We also wanted a reminder of where we came from, and to never ever take our meals and servers for granted.  When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendliest of people. The place is clean, well lit, and it was bustling with activity. We were promptly seated, and warmly greeted by our server. She was new there, and was a little awkward. We assuaged her apprehension by injecting humor In our interactions.  We promised ourselves that we would order from a nostalgic perspective. So we ordered sandwiches, which was all that we could afford on our wedding day. My wife ordered the Grilled Turkey and Cheese Sandwich, and I had a Cheeseburger.  Nothing spectacular, but it was acceptable by diner standards.   We also ordered Ice Cream. My wife had the Denver Mint, and I had the Continental Divide. Both were quite good.  One thing that we did appreciate about eating at this place was that we were surrounded by patrons who were primarily Seniors. Each table around us had married couples in the latter years of their life that simply enjoyed each other's company. It was very special and we were quite honored to be in their presence. They weren't the cranky old couples, but the fun couples that still enjoyed each other's company and didn't spend the whole time complaining about their food or each other. It was just great to see this on our anniversary.   And when we were all done, we were quite surprised how inexpensive the meal was. If you are looking for a great diner, with a great atmosphere, good food, low prices, and great personal service, this is definitely the place!  Speaking of great service, we graciously thanked our waitress and gave her a tip that was much greater than 100% of the bill. We wanted to let her know that she deserved it, and that she did a great job. She couldn't stop thanking us, even as we were nearly out the door.  It is just a wonderful dining establishment, tucked in a neighborhood in Scottsdale. What a gem of a find this was, courtesy of avid Yelpers!  And speaking of Thank You's, I thanked my wife for being such wonderful dinner company all these decades, and for loving me through the best and worst of times.  She joked about being a cheap date. I corrected her, stating that she is an expensive one because after the first date, I was ready to give up my future, my inheritance, my family and friends just to be with her for the rest of our lives!  I have had no regrets about my life's choices nor dining here @ Randy's on our anniversary!",

Debbie and other waitress's are friendly and always make me smile - a great way to start the day! I live in Chandler and enjoy eating breakfast at Randy's so much that I don't at all mind the early drive in to Scottsdale to eat my fav breakfast!  Chaparral park across the street is a great place to walk around the lake and enjoy the tranquil scenery and the ducks. Walk the lake at 6am - then head over and enjoy a great breakfast at Randy's to start your day!",

I got gluten free toast and can confidently say it was the best gluten free toast I've ever had. I'll be back to try the gluten free pancakes soon! Prices are very affordable and portions are big.

    "text": "Looking for some good cheap eats for your traditional breakfast fare?  Randy's is your place.  Must note that it's CASH OR CHECK, but if that's not an issue for you, not many places that fulfill that need better.  I'll admit, from the Yelp pictures I wasn't impressed, but couldn't deny the positive comments and recommendations from locals.  Yes, decor is dated, but they're just a no frills type of establishment.  They seem to focus more on the essential basics - service and food.  Food: ordered the country fried steak and subbed pancakes for my toast.  Everything was great.  Everybody else in the party was satisfied with their food as well.  They do a great job with the breakfast basics.  Nothing trendy, they just take care of your breakfast fix.  Only comment on food would be the thickness of their hash browns - but it's just my preference that I like a thinner style of hash browns.  Service: the place looked like a zoo on a Saturday morning and I don't think I saw one frazzled or upset server in the place.  Our server was friendly, quick, and attentive.  By observation alone, her co-workers seemed to be on the same playbook.  We observed some situations that they would be understandably upset about, but they trucked right along and didn't seem fazed at all.  Want a place where you can save a little on a meal by avoiding the alternative?  Randy's.",

The fact that *YOU* failed to notice it is YOUR problem) and I'm sure it's done for good reasons. Whether or not you understand it, it is what it is. Deal with it or go somewhere else, sheesh. Quit crying already all you lousy whiners.  YES, Randy's is a favorite hang out for the older crowd. Get over it. It's decent food at a decent price, served quickly and with a smile. And yet you're \"offended\" that it attracts \"codgers\"? Really? You went there, what does that say about you?  NO, I would not ever recommend Randy's for their tacos, but quite honestly, if you go into a Mom and Pop Diner in Scottsdale and order TACOS (supposedly because you felt \"rushed\" and didn't know what else to order?!?) it is very clearly your own fault. Quit blaming other people for your own shortcomings. Next time, try the Cheeseburger with fries and coleslaw.  Better yet, go for breakfast and order just about anything...except Tacos.",

The daily dinner specials include soup or salad( albeit a very small salad) coffee or tea and Desert which by the way all of their deserts are homemade. It is a family owned and operated local place .We always try patron locally owned and operated businesses. Weekend breakfast is always very busy. Want fast ,fresh and affordable?

I had the evening special:  baked ham with scalloped potatoes and applesauce - tasted just like a good ol' fashioned home cooked meal.  The shake I had for dessert was gigantic, and my wife enjoyed her pumpkin pie.  Anxious to try their breakfast after reading the other reviews now.  Wish I'd have known about this place sooner as I'll be moving out of the area soon...",

Living in Old Town, we are lucky to be surrounded by many local, unique places for a bite to eat. Normally on a weekend morning we'd venture to The Good Egg, the Breakfast Club or the Pancake House. A few months back we decided to stop by Randy's, and we are SO happy we did.  First, it is a no frills type of place. Lots of seating, the food comes out quick, the menu is basic, and it's a cash only place. Everyone that works there is busy, but friendly. The food is good, basic and filling. The prices are fantastic for the value you get. We typically come for breakfast, but this past weekend we enjoyed a delicious late lunch, and even stopped by later that evening on a bike ride for a scoop of ice cream.  I love going to Randy's, I like the food, like the people, like how normal it is. Two thumbs up :).",

If I have a bad day my husband always says \"Randys?\" for some good old fashioned American Comfort food. Country Fried Steak, Chicken Parmesan, Verde Burger. Exceptional Food, exceptional prices, exceptional people. Love, Love, Love Randys!",

    "text": "Here's the thing about Randy's; if you are looking for fancy, hip, alcohol, and artistic food in your breakfast joint selection... you are not going to like Randy's.  That being said, if you are looking for midwestern-diner-food quality with tons of options, affordable pricing, and service so fast it makes you tired watching; you sir or madame are in for a treat.  Nestled into a classic Arizona strip mall, Randy's gives you the option of avoiding chain diners like Denny's or IHOP, but still keeping the benefits.  Who says you can't have your local cake and eat it too?  Randy's accepts cash or personnel checks, which should tip you off on the median age of its patrons.  There is a long counter you can snag a seat at if you are flying solo, as well as a few old TV's up behind it playing sports/news for the morning crowd... or you could just go with the diner vibe and watch the kitchen behind the pass-thru window and see if you can figure out how they are so gosh darn efficient with so much variety.  Randy's has an ice cream counter where you pay the tab, along with an ATM for emergencies. The place is fairly large, and there is decent outdoor seating for when its not the blistering dog days of summer, as well as plenty of parking.  It's not very pretty in there, the whole place including the booths, ranges in color from pink to mauve and back again (desert 90's chic) but it gets the job done andddddd the servers always seem to be on point with the coffee refills, which ranks about x10 higher in my book of breakfast importance.  Now I love a showy brunch, most likely more so then the next person, but when I am in the mood to eat and not take all day... Randy's fits the bill.  Is Randy's 4 stars in comparison to a trendy brunch spot with all the bells and whistles and a celebrity chef?  No.  Is Randy's 4 stars for great service, breakfast food that looks and tastes like you expect, and the ability to: get in, get fed, and get out without \"rushing the experience\"?  You betcha.",

The menus are varied and offer great value for the money, large portions, daily specials, divine ice cream and sorbets,a favorite for locals and smart visitors who want to go where the locals go.   You can eat in the porch, depending in your weather tolerance. The heat never bothered us but you had a cheerful A/C  cooled interior if you wished. Can get busy! Never a long wait, and well worth  it.  This might be considered a diner, but its a diner where the locals keep going year after year. Not fancy, not haute cuisine, just a cheerful restaurant with delicious food! Comfort food! And plenty of it.",

I don't think I've been anywhere with faster service - and even firing the busiest of morning breakfast hours!! The kitchen crew is crazy organized and efficient.   The food is FABulous!! Yum yum!! My favorite is the skinny skillet. So freakin good. My husband is a big muscular guy and he easily is fueled up by the food, too. We will definitely keep coming back. Love this place!!!!

Ya, I was being judgy.  lol  Sat down, read the menu, and it was straight-forward, diner-type food.  Liver and onions, chicken parm, burgers, fried cod sandwich, breakfast...  My experience is that when places like that try to do everything, they end up doing nothing.  I ordered a double patty burger with pickles, cheese, thousand island dressing, and fried onions.  With a side of fries.  I kept my expectations low, thinking when it sucked, I could waltz next door to Safeway, and have them make me a sandwich.  Lunch comes, and comes quickly.  Soft and fresh sesame bun, two hand-formed, thick beef patties, and all the fixins.  Fries were made fresh, medium cut, totally non-oily.  I ate EVERY bite.  Like, stab the stray onion nib on the plate with the toothpick, kinda every bite.  The place offers homemade pies and ice cream.  I had a slice of mud pie.  $3, mind you.  That was scoffed as well.  My friend had egg salad and a hot fudge sundae.  Bill for both of us, including beverages (refilled without asking, btw), was $21.  To me, the low prices were just bonus.  I have no problem paying gobs of (someone else's) money for great food.  But, this place had it all.  Homestyle, fresh, good food, friendly and attentive servers and management, and, great prices.  I can't wait to go back.  :)",

It looked so good after i ate half of my bland breakfast burrito with bacon(bacon and eggs you cant go wrong in a tortilla with cheese but THEY DID!).  So i added some salsa to it to see if it would kick it up a notch...Did it work? (oh hell no!) it just felt like it added unnecessary moisture to my burrito. So i had to call the waitress who i only saw for the most part when we first arrived and up until I got my extra hot sauce that was desperately needed severely. The fact I only ate half is bad for a business that means I didn't enjoy nearly as much as I should have. I really really wanted to try their pies because they are supposed to be awesome and home made and I do not mind trying places that are supposed to have good pie because I like to compare and contrast to my own pies.   But what really pissed me off is i had the time to ask her what kind of pie they had and then our waitress went missing did not come back til the guy I am a caregiver for finished all his food and wanted his bill. BUT i easily could have finished a pie ala mode before he finished his food if she came to check on us one time after the hot sauce incident. I was trying to figure out where the hell she was most of the time and I had noticed that she was outside waiting on tables. Why on earth would a manager allow a woman or man wait on a huge area in two different areas?  Huge pet peeve i easily could have given them 4-5 stars if the service was decent that day and they easily were on the right track up til the hot sauce incident. Then the down fall came with such force to make me rate this establishment a 2.   Sad times. So much potential and they blew it.",

Went on a Saturday afternoon around 1230, the place was full of people but we didn't have to wait for a table. It is a cute little family, mom and pop type of restaurant. The food was really good and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was very kind, attentive and accomodating. I asked if she could substitute a wrap for the bun on the spicy chipotle bean veggie patty and after she was able to do that for me she continued to ask if I was happy with my choice in a sincere and sweet way. She continued to check on us and not in an annoying over attentive way. All the interactions we encountered were friendly and generous. This was our first time here since we are just visiting AZ on vacation and we really enjoyed our dining experience here. Good food for the prices and great service. Another local restaurant we can add to our list of recommendations :) We didnt get dessert, but if we are able to come back before the trip is over we will be back for some.",

Owners are always present to make sure things everything flowing.  They know how to run the business.  You can be in and out in half the time of a regular sit-down restaurant if you like.    Randy's has a loyal following with some folks making this their regular dining table.  They cater to an older crowd, many who come for the cheery familiar service as much as the food.

This fat boy ended up with a doggie bag. Trust me, I can normally kill it!  The prices are super reasonable but there is one catch, this is a cash only establishment, so get your dough ahead of time.  They are constantly busy but waits are never long. There is also counter service if you want to pony up right away.  The menu is quite large and filled with all of your favorites. The service staff is fun and interactive. I met the owners and they are super nice too. This is a icon in the local Scottsdale community. Stop in and check them out! They rock!",

Stereotypical diner. The food is good but the place is average for me.  Daily specials that can include soup or salad, the entree, and a desert of choice (until they run out).  For helpers, you'll probably be the youngest customer. Lots of retirees",

We placed our order for three people and, like, five minutes later it came out, perfectly done and piping hot. The quality was really good, and our server was super friendly and helpful.

We also take all of our out of town guests there when they land in Phoenix. It feels like home at Randy's!",

    "text": "There are no words. However, in the interest of my fellow foodies, I must warn you about Randy's. This is quite possibly the worst food I've ever paid $55 for in this entire Valley.  Walking in, there is NO \"homey\" feel, as other Yelpers write. It looks, sounds, and smells like you're in a NURSING HOME.  If you've never been to a nursing home... well, Randy's is what one looks, sounds, and smells like.  No joke. This restaurant does not cater to \"the elderly.\" Scottsdale is the elderly. Florida is the elderly. These patrons are at least 100 years old. You're surrounded by wheelchairs and walkers. Some even have tassels! In our booth, we got a distinct waft of (I kid you not) Aqua Net from over the wall.   There was one creepy gent sitting by himself in a booth, staring at us. I felt certain he was out on parole and looking for his next victim. He looked at me like I was a pork chop.  The server (Polly) was the sweetest thing but even sweet can't conquer the food demons raging thru this place (and likely a few ghosts).  We ordered the $10 \"barramundi\" - which my butcher/fishmonger son said NO way in hell was that fish barramundi. For. Ten. Dollars.   I ordered the chicken fried steak, which clearly and undisputedly came from Sysco. Nope, nope. Don't argue with me now.   It was covered in bacon-FLAVORED gravy, complete with little orangish Bacos floating around in it. The green beans were - admitted to by Polly - opened from a can. Lifeless little green sticks with no hope of ever becoming palatable. Didn't order them... but they \"came with the meal.\"  The \"dinner salad\" was nothing more than an old-lady portion cup of iceberg lettuce with a sad little sliver of Roma tomato perched precariously on top. Pitiful.  We also ordered the \"fish and chips\" platter, which comes with 2 small fried something-or-others that could have been swimming in the ocean at one point in their lives. And fries. Frozen.   We gave one last shot and ordered the \"homemade\" peach pie and \"homemade\" chocolate pie, having been sworn by Polly that these would blow our minds. \"Made fresh everyday!\"   Sysco... and you'll never convince me otherwise. Crappy icebox pies with perfectly formed crusts. The chocolate one even had the little chocolate jimmies on top. SYSCO. I am the grandmaster of nursing home/Sysco food because my folks owned and operated dozens of nursing homes for 35 years. People - this is Sysco nursing home food.  I have an odd desire to play Bingo now.  How in the name of Zeus' butthole has this place stayed in business since 1981?!   In the name of Odin, do not fall prey to their reviews! Trust Momma.   As for me, I'm headed home to see if our toilet can take a punch. Time to batten down the hatches and fight off what I am certain will be a scorching case of diarrhea any minute now.",

You can get comfort food like meatloaf and mashed potatoes (that's what I had) or trout with a baked potato, veggies and a salad.  You can get burgers, choice of soups, desserts, etc.  Think diner food.    We had Kaitlyn as a server, a young, energetic young lady who was attentive and efficient.   BTW, the meatloaf dinner was $6 on Sunday.  Amazing.  The trout was $11 or so.   I had a sugar-free chocolate pudding which was really good--$3 bucks.   This is a budget friendly place to eat and while the food is not a wow, it is very good. Bring cash as they don't take credit cards.",

We joined up with some friends after swim lessons to hit up their \"kids eat free\" night at Randy's (M-W) with the purchase of an adult entree $7.50 or higher. Not hard to make that happen.   We had some grilled quesadillas (pretty tasty and so was the salsa, but I do question the grilled onions being cooked on meat grill...). The kids had mini burgers (totally fresh!) and chicken fingers. They got a drink and an ice cream. Quite the steal. I think our total for our family of 4 since the kids were free was about $18.   Pay at the counter, order ice cream or pie to go, also. They have an extensive menu and it's really affordable. Wouldn't say the food was out of this world, but it was pretty good, so that deserves 4 stars for sure.",

This was my first time here, but family has dined here previously with mixed reviews.  They have an extensive menu with lots of offerings.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich expecting a fresh cooked egg, but it was more like a rubbery processed egg. English muffin wasn't toasted, and Swiss cheese was like rubber and wouldn't even cut. Our order of a traditional breakfast with eggs easy, bacon, sausage and pancakes was a better choice. I'd stick with that, although the pancakes had no flavor.  The restaurant was very clean, service was attentive. I'd give the food another try, something different though.",

For a city that is 60 % non whites, you would never know it. From the staff to the patrons.  4. All in all. If you have any self respect for food and experience, spend the extra 5 minutes driving towards old town or Arcadia. There are so many great spots in Phoenix. This is not one.

Our order was brought to our table in record time and was hot and delicious. The foods that were supposed to be cold (fruits and dairy) seemed fresh and as expected. Their prices were very reasonable and the restaurant seems to do a high volume of business. We will definitely come back the next time we are in the area.",

Staff are \"annoyingly\" (not because they were annoying, but not what you get from a lot of restaurants these days, so, it's a compliment) friendly. Food are nicely done, seasoning....well, it is \"balanced\". The eggs are done just right, the sausage and bacon are a little bit salty (as expected), the harshbrown was perfectly crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside....just not much seasoning. Not the end of the world because I find that to be just right pairing with the sausage and bacon. The pancakes is perfectly balanced between airy and dense. Very nice. Overall, a lovely place to have a brunch. No wonder they were voted the best breakfast diner in town",

This trip I had the breakfast sandwich which was really good and very inexpensive.   Worth noting: I dine alone fairly often. I said that I'd sit at the counter, but they offered me a booth. Nice touch! Most restaurants want to reserve larger tables for people that haven't even walked in the door. So nice to be treated as an important customer even though I'm by myself!  Important! Cash and Checks only!",

Don't get me wrong - you're not getting \"cuisine\" here; you're getting really good comfort food, you're getting spectacular service (the kind that makes you feel you've been there a million times and they know who you are and they care about how you're doing), you're getting your meal within approximately 5 minutes of when you order it, and you're getting prices that make you think you just went back 40 years in time. Been here only 3 times now, but I feel like I belong, and I love the food and service. My wife and I both said, \"I love this place,\" so we'll be there weekly for as long as we can lift a fork. On this last visit, I had lunch (liver and onions cooked perfectly) instead of breakfast, so I ordered iced tea instead of coffee. It came with an honest to goodness tea spoon (if you don't know what a teaspoon is, you may be too young to eat here - you probably don't recognize many of the words used on the menu). Liver and onions came with mashed potatoes with brown gravy (like my childhood gravy out of a tin foil packet - YUM) and a nice helping of green beans like mom used to heat out of the can. Add a dash of salt and a goodly sized portion of pepper and let the repast from the past begin!",

    "text": "I went for breakfast yesterday with friends who assured me they had gluten free options.  I ordered gluten free pancakes and our food arrived literally less than 5 minutes later, which made me suspicious. I asked how the server was sure they were gluten free as there was nothing on the plate to designate them from regular pancakes.  I was told \"that's what I was told\". I ate less than half, as they were not tasty, had a weird texture to them, like they weren't cooked all the way through. I should have insisted on talking to the manager right then and there but since my friends eat there frequently, I guess I felt somewhat assured. However, I should have trusted my gut, literally, because after I left, I can tell you that I was not given gluten free pancakes. I will spare you all the gastro nightmares that followed, as they are too embarrassing to mention here. But I did call this morning and spoke to a manager about what happened. He did indicate they do not designate GF pancakes before the order goes out. I asked him to use this as a teachable moment and encouraged him to put a process in place so that this doesn't happen again. I did share the ensuing gastro nightmare with him to drive my point home and to convey the seriousness of the consequences when staff do not take allergy sensitivities to heart. I don't want anyone to suffer as I have over the past 24 hours since eating here. I do not believe the manager took me seriously though, despite his apologies. Because of that, I will likely never return to this restaurant. Anyone with food sensitivities may wish to steer clear as they clearly do not take food allergies seriously here.",

    "text": "I think for the average person I would give it 4  stars but for the reasons stated below it dropped significantly!  If I cannot be safe then what's the point?  First off a yelp check in offer appears for this restaurant stating a deal on gluten free toast.  According to the Manager they don't advertise with yelp and think that yelp is a rip off because if you don't advertise with them then you get less stars...so that is why she'd never advertise with yelp. So I don't know why that comes up on my phone app.  I am a celiac so it is dangerous for my health if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, etc.)  This restaurant offers gluten free toast and pancakes.  Most people would assume that since they offer these choices then they would follow cross contamination guidelines and know how to prepare food to keep people with Celiac safe.  This is not the case. Yesterday, I had an excellent waitress.  I asked her point blank if the gluten free toast (which is more expensive) was toasted in a dedicated toaster.  She said that yes, it was toasted.  I then said again specifically, \"So you have a toaster JUST for the gluten free toast?  And you are using separate utensils and butter?\"  She looked at me like I was speaking Russian (and that is NEVER a good sign when addressing these issues.)  She stated, it's toasted in the big toaster we use for the toast.  AH!  So then I asked if they prepare the gluten free pancakes on the same griddle as the regular ones and prep those in the same area as well.  And the answer (that I figured was coming) was yes.  No, there is no other prep area in the back for keeping gluten free items apart.  No cross contamination education imparted.  She didn't even understand that there needed to be any procedures followed.   Now, don't get me wrong, this was a very nice waitperson.  She was very concerned when I was asking her these questions.  I asked her if she could make sure that someone with clean hands (not having touched regular items) could get me my slices of gf bread and just put them on my plate and not toast it?  And she did that for me herself!  Pretty soon the Manager came over to follow up on the gf toast issue.  I asked her again if they had training and separated areas for the gf products and she said that they did not.  I asked her why they didn't if they were offering gluten free toast and pancakes.  I told her that I get sick when the toast is made in the same toaster from the other bread crumbs being on my gf toast.  That I had eaten it there before and now understood why I had been sick!  Her answer (I kid you not!) was that people with Celiac Disease should just KNOW that a restaurant like theirs wouldn't follow protocols or that a person should ASK how they were prepared.   They just offered gluten free items for people restricting gluten from their diet for lifestyle.  REALLY?  Advertising something gluten free and charging significantly higher prices for it do NOT get you access to the safety of training your employees?  NOT stating that on your menu?  I now KNOW that she knows there is a difference since she said that she expects Celiac's to know they won't follow safety precautions!  I told her that I think that she is endangering people's health and that her answers were not acceptable.  Her entire explanation was that I couldn't possibly hold her responsible for my issues if I didn't explicitely state my needs to her so they could tell me their gf foods are unsafe for me to consume.  I won't be back!  But if you don't have gluten or other dietary issues.....go ahead on!",

They do NOT seat you until your entire party is present and they do NOT take credit cards (personal checks and cash only).  They do have an ATM in the restaurant if you need to use it.  The breakfast is consistently good, the service is lightning fast (sometimes like magic... order taken and then food appears!), and the staff is the best.  It reminds me of the old diners in Los Angeles... everyone seems to know everyone by name, the food is family-friendly familiar, the prices can't be beat, and the service is top notch.  Would highly recommend Randy's for a quick breakfast.",

She was about 5 min away, but the hostess refused to seat us until she arrived. Whatever...I can roll with it. Then, I notice 2 tacky little signs indicating \"We take cash only\" and some nonsense about not having meetings or studying there..i.e. don't take up too much time. I should have bolted right then! The food is marginal at best, nothing outstanding at all about it. I will admit, it's cheap. However, here's the ickiest thing about Randy's. A male waiter in his late 40's-early 50's passed by our table and my friend politely asked him for a refill on her coffee. He replied \"I will only refill your cup if you do this\" and proceeds to shake his chest toward us. We gave a blank stare and he said \"I saw you shake your chest when you walked in.\" We both just sat there stunned! Not only was it incredibly offensive and inappropriate, it bordered on sexual harassment. Also- my young children heard the whole exchange. I will NEVER step foot inside this place again. Terrible experience all around and the waiter should be fired!",

They are cash/checks only but that's fine because the shopping center they are in has a chase bank and a Wells Fargo inside of Safeway, so getting cash shouldn't be a problem for most.

I had the California omelet with potatoes. It was ok. Didn't finish it. For some reason, the food there isn't as well prepared as it use to be years ago. You can tell they have cut corners. I ordered calves liver and onions a few years ago. I make this myself. It was the worse I ever had. I'm a good cook and know the difference. Will be going else where from now on. But, I must give the personnel a big thumbs up as they are the best at welcoming and serving you.",

Then she had a nervous laugh the whole time we were taken care of by her which was super annoying. Next all the food is beyond flavorless and extremely bland. All the meats are boiled nothing is actually cooked. I sent my.meal back because I couldn't eat it due to the fact it had a funky taste to it. When I called over another server to ask for our server she immediately attacked me. What do you want?? How professional is she? I told her she didn't have to be so nasty and she got even nastier.  All cash is for a reason so when you have a shitty meal you can't dispute the charge. This place is horrifically bad and I can't believe people actually eat there and say it's good. Do not waste your time with this place. If you can't eat your food they make you pay for it anyways. The owner could care less too about the poor service and lousy food we got. Horrible service, horrible food.",

    "text": "Rock-bottom prices and fast friendly service are the highlights of this neighborhood diner. I stepped inside and liked the retro feel of this place. It was a busy morning for them on Friday at 9 A.M., but service was still cheerful and friendly. I decided to get an order to go at the counter to the side of the entrance.   I ordered the #2 breakfast special: Corned beef hash, potatoes, 2 eggs, and toast. Quite a lot of food for only $6! You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked, and type of potatoes and toast. I decided on poached eggs, country potatoes, and wheat toast.  I only waited maybe 5 minutes for my order. Wow they are fast! Driving home, the delicious savory smells wafted through my car, increasing my hunger for breakfast! I opened up the to-go boxes and found hearty portions of each component of my meal. They were as follows:  Corned beef hash: Looked like it came straight from a can (Perhaps a Hormel can?) Tasty nonetheless (I grew up on that stuff!), and it looked like they dumped the whole can's contents, griddled it, and put it in my meal.  Country potatoes: Perfectly cooked and griddled, with a good savory taste.  Poached eggs: They came in a small Styrofoam cup with lid to keep the other parts of my meal from getting soggy. The yolks were a little more hard-cooked than I usually like.  Toast: The weakest part of the meal. I got 2 whole slices of buttered wheat toast, but each slice was burnt. The toast came with one packet of grape jelly.  Overall, it was a lot of food for the amount I paid, and I ate everything (Except the really burnt parts of the toast) with gusto. They accept cash or check only, which keeps prices down.   Since it was cold outside that morning, I didn't venture out to the patio area, but it looked nice. One of these days, in nicer weather, I'd like to try it out. I hear they are dog-friendly too, so maybe my pup will come along for the ride!",

Purchased a couple of cups of ice cream which were served up, but when i asked about toppings, i was told, in no uncertain terms, adding toppings makes your cups of ice cream a 'sundae' and we have to charge more. We left with the 2 cups and was not particularly impressed with the quality of the contents.  I wont be back during this trip.",

Canned yams, canned green beans, canned cranberry sauce, and two dry turkey slices with canned gravy. I was hoping a nice slice of pie would make up for my already upset stomach. Nope! They brought me a disgusting slice of factory made, slimy apple pie. Worst of all it wasn't cheap in the least. Two dinners with two sodas cost $33. I feel totally let down, and bummed that I wasted so much money. Maybe their breakfast is better? Too bad I won't be back to find out.",

It was OK but i was still hungry. So I ordered a cup of chili. It also was average , but It was served a little on the cool side and the sour cream I asked for was $.50 extra. I thought $3.00 for a cup of chili was a bit much. The service was good and the wait time for the food was also good.

The snowbirds haven't arrived (no wonder since this summer has had more days over 110 than ever before) but it is still crowded with the locals.  On Friday nights the popular fare is chicken and dumpling which includes salad or soup, coffee or tea and an ice cream dessert.  If you order a la carte you save a couple of bucks. If you skip the dumplings you get more chicken.  In general the food is bland so one needs to add lots of pepper. It may not sound like an exciting way to spend Friday night but if one leaves early one can work out at the gym to avoid the oppressive heat.",

There was WAY too much nutmeg or some spice in it. It was overwhelming. My friend could smell it from across the table. The food was cheap though so it was good enough to justify what we ate, but too many good breakfast options nearby to come back. Oh, and they only take cash or checks because the credit card company charges too much. And this is a decent-sized establishment! I've been to tiny whole-in-the-walls that took CCs. I was annoyed by this. It's 2011, let's get with the program!",

The food is great home cooking and never a long wait.  That's why we've been visiting Randy's for over 20 years.  Thank you to everyone at Randy for so many great meals.  Our out of town relatives always want to go there first when they come visit.  Were looking forward to another 20 plus years of Randy meals.",
