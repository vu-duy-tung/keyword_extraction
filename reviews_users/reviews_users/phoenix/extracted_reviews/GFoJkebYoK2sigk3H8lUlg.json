No worries, the ribs had a great smoke ring and the sauce is a great pair for the smoke flavor. If you don't like strong smoke flavor, you many want to try the brisket or pulled pork.  I also tried the pulled pork and chopped brisket sliders to get a taste of as much of their bbq as possible. Neither one disappointed, they had enough meat that each one with overflowing and we added the leftover meat to our fries.  Fries were great. Fresh hand cut fries. Hot from the fryer and salted well.   BBQ beans were below average. Little flavor. I won't order them again.  Our server was amazing! Very attentive, but not a stalker.",

Food smells good and the place is empty so we can sit anywhere. There's a young guy there manning the front and one guy in the kitchen. I'm still unsure...  The host (Alex)who seated us was sooooo cool! The music let me know I was home. I won't elaborate. You'll have to go and see for yourself. The menu is just big enough to give a variety for a small place with a small crew. I ordered the Cactus burger. My guests ordered the Cowboy. Typical order for a first visit to a new restaurant. Safe option til you get familiar with the new spot  and all it's inner workings. I'm obsessed with fresh unadulterated French fries (like my mother made when I was growing up). They have just that. Potatoes and sea salt. Why mess them up with anything else!  Meanwhile, Alex is being the host with the most! Making sure we are enjoying the music, offering suggestions for dinner..: we can see the cook in the back, making it happen. AND, Brioche on a burger say no more! Perfectly cooked well done without burning the flavor out of the meat.  To finish the meal, we had the fried ice cream... fabulous!!! Thanks Alex and nice guy in the kitchen! We will return soon to try the bbq!",

The brisket is tender & nicely complimented by the in house barbecue sauce which is thick, tangy, and a little spicy. Beverages include local brewery beers that change with the season. The decor is Arizona desert playful and the service is friendly & prompt. A great place for a casual meal with friends or a date night.",

Would have been a nice value but the potato salad that came with it was kind of a tiny portion, served in a little cup. If it were a bit bigger I'd come back for more burgers, or maybe just order fries next time. Service was a bit mixed - great from one person and kind of cold from another, not sure if one or both were the owners. Seems like a good local place with good food and drinks, but not feeling a need to hurry back.",

Food is ok but they always seem to see how fast they can serve you like it's an accomplishment.  When you order food and they serve it 3-4 minutes later, it's like it was already made, all the did was take it out of a warmer and put it on a plate.  Also .......  I guarantee if the sold Coors Light and Jack Daniels more people would be there and stay longer.  Everyone knows BBQ and Whiskey go hand and hand.  .  Have you change owners again?",

We get so use to eating food that's been stripped of everything and masked in sauce that it's just simply great that a burger like this exists.

They have it to create a Cuban which I'll try on my next visit. Overall I'm just appreciative that a good burger does exist out there if your not taking a good burger for granted.

Lately, they've been hosting tap takeover nights with local breweries, and last night they had a very talented guitarist providing music.

They have not yet started brewing their own beer, but that should be happening in the next couple of weeks. I will definitely return to sample those.  As it is now, they have six taps of regional beer. Mostly Arizona, but they did have 2 varieties of Scuplin on tap. Although just a few handles, all of the beers are good options. I had a coffee brown from the Shop (another one of my favorite places) and a Dragoon IPA. The food not only was good, but for a brewery the presentation was excellent. I ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the marinated pork was excellent. I paired it with a salad instead of fries. The portions were large and the presentation was impressive. I would go back just on the food alone.  The space has a nice feel as well. I love the exposed brick look. This will be a great spot to hang out and have a few new local beers and good food. Definitely give them a try.",

Drinks- we don't drink beer, so maybe that was our mistake. They didn't have iced tea. The soda is in cans. I got Diet Coke. The ice that I poured my Diet Coke into tasted horrible. Made the whole drink taste bad.   Food- we got the poutine as an appetizer and it was good. I'd recommend  it. It did take awhile to come to our table though. We also ordered burgers and fries. They were delicious- hence more stars. Cooked well and tasted great. One complaint- we wanted to try the trio of sauces but the server (who is also apparently the owner) said they were out of all of the sauces. Bummer.   Service- ok. Not great. He was a little frazzled and seemed to not quite know what he was doing. It also took a very very long time for him to bring us our bill. In fact I wrote this review while we waited. We eventually had to get up and ask for it.   Overall- I think there are a lot of areas for improvement and it could be a lot better.",

It seems they have sort of an identity crisis in their decor. Like random pics and Hobby Lobby type bar/beer signs. There was a dude who seemed like the owner. He made a joke about people asking if they had Coors Light and upon learning they didn't carry it just went for water. We all sort of laughed but the irony was not lost on me that the biggest beer sign in the places was... you guessed it, Coors Light. I hope we got a bad batch of IPA and that otherwise people flock to this seemingly mom & pop place.",

Everything is reasonably priced and the owners are receptive to customer feedback. One simple example was folks asked them to add a chicken sandwich to the menu and they did. The weekly menu specials are a nice way to change things up. My favorite burger is the Twisted Cactus burger and it has always been cooked properly. I'm a medium well guy and get sick and tired of other places bringing me out a rare burger. Thank you TC for getting it right.   We look forward to more beers being produced by Twisted Cactus. In the meantime the alternative selections, especially from other AZ Brewers is great.   Everyone should give this place a try.",

We added a side of fries.  The burros were as good as any i've ever had. The fries are some of the best i've ever had.  We also enjoyed a nice cold glass of Kohi imperial coffee stout. Prices are very reasonable. We got out of there for $31 and I'm happy paying that to fill my belly and sample some great local beer.  Tony told us that he's preparing a happy hour menu and should have it all squared sometime next week.  We will def be back.   Prost!",

We have gone to the restaurant twice in 4 days and each time, they are out of food. How does that happen? It is only 6:00 in the evening. It's not like we came in at 10 PM. Very frustrating. I give them a 5 for food, a 1 for service (lack of good) so a 2 overall. I want this place to succeed but honesty I wont go out of my way again. If I'm in the area, I might stop in but I wont make it a destination. I would add the bartender working tonight (not one of the owners) was rude and could not have cared less about the situation.",

Either way, food took way too long and our service was glacially slow. There was maybe three other tables seated, so it wasn't busy by any standard. Bottom line, server messed up and threw the kitchen under the bus...Shame, wanted to like this place. The food was ok, nothing special.",

Tonight the bartender said some kegs didn't come in.    They only have 7 drafts on the menu.  Their own brew is far off.  Just focus on what you can provide and customers will come.  No need to apologize before each beer order.  This location is hidden.  I am hoping for the best.    My bartender was great.  Got me a beer and kept her attention on me.  No waiting, she knew I was reading the menu and got my pretzel order in.  Small size.  Fine for me, but not for more than 1.  Pic shown.  Good cheese sauce.  It was rather dead.

We came on a Saturday evening and it was slow so we sat up at the bar. I ordered the brisket/pork taco combo and my husband had the brisket and bbq beans. Very good food! My tacos were authentic and had the right amount of spice. They don't have many beers on tap to choose from but the selection they had was good.  Service was friendly also. If you're looking for a smaller \"hole in the wall\" restaurant away from the busier restaurants I'd choose this place!",

They kept our drinks filled and took away our dirty plates.  The prices were reasonable.  The restaurant was clean and well staffed.  However, the food was less than stellar.  My husband ordered a burger.  It was not even close to what he was hoping for.  It looked like a burger I pan cooked on the top of our stove.  He was unimpressed.  I ordered the 2 meat BBQ dinner with a side of fries.  The fries were bland and a little greasy.  The meat was fatty and the bbq sauce was nondescript.  We also ordered queso and chips to start.  I wouldn't be surprised that there was a big can of yellow queso in the back.  The chips tasted like they came from a big bag.  It wasn't that the food was \"bad\" just nothing that would make me want to return.  There are better places to get BBQ with a wider selection of beer.  I wish my review could be better.  I like to frequent small businesses.",

It was served in a green plastic basket, totally unlike the photo. The side of potato salad was a tiny scoop that you could eat in 2 bites. Which was sad to me because the potato salad tasted very good! it tasted far better than my burger.  Also, I'm confused by the name because I thought twisted cactus would have their own brews, which they did not. I enjoyed the beer I did have, which was an IPA. The TV picture quality is also kind of poor.   The owner was pretty nice though. He was inviting, and recommended we try the BBQ next time.",

They recently got bought out like three weeks ago so they have to reapply for a new license in order to serve their own house brews so instead, they have other Arizona beers on tap. I feel like I can't rate them fairly yet since they don't have their house brews so let's just talk about everything else.   The food is pretty decent. They smoke their meats in house so that beautiful smoke meat ring can be found in your meat. I usually like my ribs saucy but I can appreciate that they don't want to mask the smokey flavor. The brisket sandwich was a bit dry though. I offered my coleslaw up to add moisture into the brisket sandwich. The house salad was basic as heck though so I'd probably skip that.   They have a small selection of Arizona beers on tap. All are served in a perfect cold mug. I can't wait to be able to try their own brews.  Service was a bit lacking since there were only like two people serving the whole restaurant but they're trying their best.  All in all, I would love to come back and try some Twisted Cactus beer but for now, I'm a bit sadden by the misleading business name.",

The beer choices were fun too so I tried the flight of 4 option.  The wife of the owners stopped by (who came in to help because how busy they got) and shared how they took over in the last few months.  Given their strong rating prior they have done well carrying on the reputation.  I commented how the restrooms were very clean, a nice surprise at a pub.  The icing on the cake was we got lucky with live music; very fun popular classic rock music at the perfect volume not overtaking dinner conversation.  We'll be back!",

I can't speak to the beer so maybe that's why it's getting the reviews?? The fries are horrible. They are legit soggy. I sent them back and asked for crispy ones. They came out as soggy as the first. It was clear they just don't know how to make decent fries which is a big problem my book. The burger wasn't awesome either. It was something I could have made on my grill at home and I'm no cook. Kinda greasy too.  Also the ranch dressing is not thick and milky, clearly not home made. It was just like the stuff I hate from a bottle at the grocery store.

The combination of some think lightly fired onions, bbq sauce with lettuce/tomato on a fresh bun gave this great taste.  I'll definitely come back with my friends.  I also chose a side salad instead of fries.  It was large with fresh cucumbers, tomatoes & mixed fresh greens & as good as one would get in a fine restaurant.",

Unfortunately, not able to serve their own beers yet, but soon. As is, they have a nice mix of local and out of state taps. Friendly staff. Bartender offered to let us taste a couple of selections before we chose what to order. Limited food selection. Mainly appetizers and sandwiches. We tried the Cuban sandwich, and it was great. Plentiful ingredients, and the Dijon mustard, rather than typical yellow, really topped it off well.  The side salad we got, rather than fries, was really generous. We don't live close, but will definitely be back next time we are in the area.",

Biggest downfall, which they are new so we hope this gets better, is the service- especially when it's busy-- once we waited over an hour and the waitress when asked still hadn't put in our appetizer order so we left. Although that was a little extreme, our other visits never took that long but also there wasn't as many customers. Still would def recommend during the slower times and the cactus burger is a must try!",

We were greeted quickly upon arrival and told we could sit anywhere we liked.  In just a few minutes the waiter brought menus and we ordered our drinks.  Food came up fairly quickly. My husband ordered the brisket, pork and potato salad with an extra side of Cole slaw.  I ordered brisket, ribs, fries and an extra side of Cole slaw.  The brisket was very tasty and served on Texas toast, but it was cold.  The pork was excellent and warm.  The ribs were outstanding and warm.  If the brisket would have been hot we would have given the meal five stars!  As for the sides, the fries were awesome, but the Cole slaw and potato salad weren't worth it - both were totally  tasteless.  Prices are reasonable.  Will we return?  Probably, when we want bbq and don't want to drive far.",

    "text": "This review is based on two visits this past weekend during the daytime for lunch. They have one menu so no changes at night. I had read some prior reviews so I was wondering what I was walking in to but was pleasantly surprised.  Atmosphere - Good natural light during the day, the tables aren't crowded so it was comfortable. They had good music in the background but it was at the right level. They have a semi-open kitchen so you see the chef working hard to put out some really good food.  Service - It wasn't real busy and we had very attentive service. No issues.  Beer - They haven't started brewing there yet but have a good variety of 7 taps with some great local breweries like Huss Brewing.  Food - Everything, from both meals, was outstanding. Of the four dishes we had three different burgers and they were the best I've had in the area. The  1/2 lb patties have a good sear/char but cooked perfectly to my requested temperature (medium rare). All high quality ingredients from the meat, bun, bacon, etc. We had the Twisted Cactus burger with fresh poblanos roasted, the Cowboy Up which has a ton of flavor and the Bacon Blue which had awesome bacon. The French fries are handmade and awesome. I'll repeat, best burgers in the area, period.  I've read other reviews and heard the same things from friends so I hope management has worked out the service because the burgers are go to dishes.",

It had a splendid amount of pulled pork, BBQ beans, onions and fresca queso draped over a very juicy and quite tasty smoked frank.  I paired it with a side of potato salad, which was good, but would probably go with slaw next time to really compliment the taste and texture of the dog.

    "text": "Quite possibly the tastiest, freshest, most affordable bbq I've ever had... and this is coming from a Missouri/Texas girl!   The flavor of the meat stood out 110% from other places I've tried. Its similar to Lucilles, which is another favorite of mine. BBQ sauce was tasty... not too sweet or spicy just perfect!   The menu is small so you dont have to worry about getting overwhelmed with choices. I had poutine fries for 6 bucks and it was so much food I couldnt eat it all!   Service was second to none... friendliest waitress I've ever had (visit 9/2 1140am)! Would come back based on service alone but the food is so good i will bring everyone back!   Super impressed. Chill vibe. Will be back. I dont think I've ever been so happy at a BBQ place... yum!!",

The on tap ipa was crisp and refreshing with sweet flavors. The lager was bright and smooth. We were lucky enough to be there Taco Tuesday the smoked pork tacos were full flavored and unaccompanied by a hot homemade salsa.  The brisket taco was also good, but definately the pork is best. The chicken taquitos were Uh-Maze-ing!! Smoked chicken and hand rolled. Crunchy, and moist;the ratio foe tortilla to filling was on point. The truffle fries were bold and salty with perfect notes of flavor nothing too overwhelming. Can't wait to return.",

Service - it was lunchtime and they only had 1 server. He was nice enough but we saw good waiting in the window a few times.   Overall a small place with a lot of potential. I will try it again but most likely only when I'm thirsty.",

The sides are generous portions, too. The slaw is traditional and creamy. The beans have loads of sauce and quite a bit of meat, too. The quesadilla is not one folded tortilla, but two making a cheesey, spicy sandwich. The accompanying salsa is chock full of flavor and brings a good bit of heat with it!  The staff is friendly and solicitous, but not bothersome. This is a place to be one of the neighborhood favorites!",

We ordered the poutine so it would be soft for him too chew and he complained about the lack of pulled pork. This chef hand delivered us more pulled pork on him.

( I am guessing they have their own beers by now). We chatted the whole time with the very friendly bartender and even the cook stuck his head out to see if we liked his Cubano (very good!). We thought this place was fun, friendly and had a really good vibe. Check it out!",

They have the kind of menu that makes you want to try everything in it.  And it's not too long, the way some restaurants try to serve a little of everything.  Just one page, which is plenty.  I had the St. Louis ribs and they were delicious.  They're saucy, super tender, and the perfect size.  If you're not into saucy bbq, there are other great options, like the burgers, the wings, the brisket, a Sonoran hot dog (which I'm determined to try in the future), and others.  The fries are also delicious, both the regular (hand-cut) type, and the ones with garlic parmesan.  Their drink selection is strong!  Bottled beers, craft beers on tap, and some really good, semi-obscure whiskeys and tequilas, as well as margaritas and other cocktails.  They have a nice bar area, as well as tables (quasi-booths).  I am also a fan of the place itself.  It's small, but they very smartly maximize their space.  There's the bar, then there's like a small counter area, and then there are tables.  The kitchen is semi-open, so you can see it from the bar.  Even though it's a small place, I reckon they can easily fit 30 people COMFORTABLY in there.  I hesitate to use this word, but I kept thinking how the whole experience for us was flawless.  We will definitely be back.",

It was quiet  Ordered the brisket sandwich lunch special with fries. My friend had the 3 meat combo The brisket was good lots of fries enough for sharing. The pork and brisket on the 3 meat combo were excellent. The ribs however I'm sad to say were actually overdone. Not falling off the bones, not burnt ends just hard and dry. Maybe they had an off day.   The menu has some interesting combos like bbq nachos, burritos. Kind of a play on Tex mex with bbq.  Only 1 selection of bbq sauce but it is good.   They have local beers and wines. Liquor for other drinks.   Service was friendly and prompt. Food came out fast at the right temp  They have $6 lunch specials and happy hour deals.   We enjoyed our lunch and would consider coming back if in the area.",

These were great (fries with brown gravy, smoked pork & queso fresco) perfect balance of all flavors.  I loved that the gravy portion was enough to flavor & not saturate the fries.  We would order these again - definitely big enough to share.   Paired this with an Orange Blossom wheat beer from Papago Brewery - paired nicely.  When we were placing our dinner order, they informed us that the ribs had about 45 minutes left in the smoker.  We were not in a hurry, nor were we starving so we said we could wait.  The fries were enough to keep us satiated during that time.  Dinner did not disappoint.  The slab of ribs were extremely meaty & a very generous portion.  They did taste better the next day & we figured that perhaps the meat needed a little time to set up after coming out of the smoker.   The sauce was very good.   The other dinner we chose was the #3 combo of smoked pork and beef brisket with cole slaw.  They were both delicious  - meats were tender & very     I would order those again.",

The sauce was a standard sweet spicy bbq sauce. Meat had flavor. I gave it another try and this time ordered the bbq lunch sandwich for take out, and again disappointed. The bun looked like, and tasted like, a store bought, pre packaged, small hamburger bun. They did fill it with a good portion of meat, but it was again dry. But this time, some bites had a burnt flavor. It was also chewy for a bbq sandwich and way too much sauce. I only ate half the small bbq sandwich. The portion of fries was considerably larger than the bbq  sandwich. So my main lunch entree was the fries. I didn't bother calling to complain because they would offer to make me another. I already had two bad bbq experiences, I don't need a third. Live and learn. I won't be returning for bbq. Staff and service was great. I realize this is a pub and not a bbq restaurant, so the three stars is for the pub, drinks, service and staff. Food, minus two.",

Both the brisket and pork were delicious, they were out of potato salad so we went with Cole slaw which was just ok. Service was great, beers cold and good selection. They offered tastings before you ordered one.",

The waitress was very attentive and friendly.  We started with the poutine fries as an appetizer. The plate came with a lot of fries and meat. It was very flavorful but I would have prefdered to have a little more gravy. My son had the cowboy burger which he said was very tasty and came with about a half pound of fries. I had the brisket and pork bbq. Good flavor and the potatoes salad was creamy and delicious. I would recommend this to anyone. $$  This will be my hidden gem when I'm in the area.",

Walking into a small storefront and the bar was pretty small, well lit, and no music.... I questioned even staying there, just for the fact that it seemed kinda boring. I ordered a beer from a local brewery (huss scottsdale blonde) and I ordered the a-1 burger. After having a couple beers I started to enjoy myself, the staff was very courteous and friendly. The burger was bomb, and the fries were just as good. I would have hung out for awhile longer if they had a jukebox or at least a radio going on. Good place for a quick bite, but after that onto the next place for drinks!",

The only thing they have going for them was the pulled pork on the fries was good. Wilderness brewing company blows them out of the water. There are too many new breweries and places to eat for this place to last. Nothing about this place makes us want to return.",

The food here is actually really great, my burger was perfectly cooked and had excellent flavor.  The fresh cut fries were delicious and crispy.  The wife also ordered a burger, but without a bun as part of her diet, and they delivered a delicious patty on a bed of lettuce with all the toppings.  The service was very friendly and everyone was hustling and working very hard to make sure that everything was running smooth and quick.  I think they take reservations, so I would definitely call ahead before arriving if you are coming during peak dinner hours with a group.  Next time I go, I am absolutely going to try the BBQ, I wanted to try everything I saw going out of the kitchen.  They also have a pretty decent selection of micro brews that they seem to change weekly based on what the owner chooses, and the price for the beer was not bad at $5.50.",

Their French Fries are the ultimate comfort food and dipped in their aioli or spicy ketchup (think curry spice with deeply sweet tomato) is heaven for the card lover in me. They've only developed one beer, their Twisted Cactus IPA, which is exactly what I want from an IPA- hoppy, but clean, refreshing. What a beautiful Sunday lunch spot! Additionally, as I type this Creedence Clearwater Revival is playing over their overhead system. Highly recommend, will be returning soon!",

The waitress was attentive and refilled drinks when she saw it getting low but not like a helicopter where she would hover or ask me how the food is mid-bite. She would do temperature checks with us to make sure the food was to our liking and we talked about local beers (they had Cider Corps which is a plus in my book). We think the owner and her family was here because a woman came in like a customer with a large group at a table in the back, but she also stopped by to ask us how we liked the place and if this was our first time. If she wasn't the owner, then she was a super fan, I guess. Lol. The portions are slightly on the larger side, but I think that's good because men tend to have a large appetite and you want to ensure you're not shorting anyone. For me, I just got a nice to-go box after the meal.  I had the Twisted Cactus burger and hubby had brisket I believe. We had poutine to start off, and it was all delicious. Again, local beers are a plus. Loved this place and will come again!",

It didn't start off well when they were out of ribs. What??? Out??? The photos of the ribs are what solidified this as our choice for the evening. HoHum...okay...on to option B, which was the burger. It also looked fantastic in the yelp photos. Well it was less than spectacular when it arrived at our table. Didn't look anything like the gigantic burgers covered with bacon and cheese in the photos. The burger didn't even cover the bun. Disappointment #2. HoHum! Now there were some good things about the place. The seating is very comfortable! Love the table chairs! The service was very good! We were greeted nearly immediately upon entering and seated right then and there. The space is nicely laid out with plenty of elbow room and the burrito was fantastic as was the pulled pork. I'm torn between three stars and four.",

Limited selection of beers, but what they have is top notch, and inexpensive pours to boot.  The Big Chandler burger was juicy, smoky, and very well balanced. Bun had just the right amount of chewiness, and the dressed arugula was a perfect accompaniment.  Beer Bites were good, if typical, but the presentation was wonderful and the beer cheese was on point.  After years of using Yelp to find good food and drink, this is my first review. Take that for what it's worth, but I'll definitely be back!",

In the description on the menu, the salsa was supposed to be \"roasted.\"  It was Pace, plain and simple.  The guacamole was freshly made, but it had virtually no flavor.  It needed some spice or pizazz of some sort.  I am willing to give them a second chance when they have their own beers on tap, but I'm hoping that their food quality improves before the next visit.",
