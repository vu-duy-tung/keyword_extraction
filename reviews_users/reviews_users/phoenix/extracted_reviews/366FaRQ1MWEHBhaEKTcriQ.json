    "text": "It seems that every which way you turn these days there are more and more gluten free pizza options showing up around the valley. Pizza joints around Phoenix have all gotten on the bandwagon since they see how big a demand there is for gluten free pizza in Arizona and how our little community votes heavily with our dollars - even in our current economic climate. Will I pay $15 bucks for a good gluten free pizza? You betcha!  Spinato's was recommended to me by my co-worker as the best place for pizza in Phoenix. That was a pretty bold statement to make since there are so many good pizza places in town, and boy, Gary was right. I was blown away by Spinato's.  First of all, the pizzeria is tucked away in a business park behind Tempe Marketplace and unless you know someone \"in the know\" you'd probably never stumble upon it yourself. This place is no frills - block walls, old concrete floors, and simple table setups, but the food is far from simple. It's fresh, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic.  They have an entire menu devoted to gluten free item's, so there's no guesswork involved with ingredients or which combo's you can eta, etc..... I had the \"Nicole's Favorite\" pizza, which is Gluten Free Creations Signature crust, topped generously with slices of Genoa salami, artichoke hearts, onions, and lightly sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It was perfecto!  Now, let's talk about the sauce. I think their pizza sauce may actually be the best pizza sauce I've ever had. It was slightly sweet with loads of fresh tomato flavor, and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a perfect balance and I had to refrain from eating the whole darn pizza so I didn't look like a total pig to my new co-workers. I politely took half home and then devoured the rest at 4:00 as a late afternoon lunch.  \"Nicole's Favorite\" is now \"Jessica's Favorite! Well done Spinato's!",

Their red sauce is sweet, like your typical Chicago pies, and it's actually for sale at this location along with their vodka sauce. This location is teeny tiny so I suggest carry out. People are so friendly and super nice. They get crazy busy but never let that get them down. If you've never been here, go. The only reason they lost one star was because their estimated pickup times have been at least a half an hour off, last time an entire hour, which was rather annoying, especially considering there's no room to stand and wait",

I can honestly say that Spinatos pizza was probably the best pizza I have ever had! We loved there dinner salad and there super six pizza. We split a medium and we're only to finish half of it. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a wonderful change from the typical \"fast food\" pizza restaurants. My only complaint is that at night the building was a little hard to find so I think they should have a bigger illuminated sign :)",

The menu said it fed 2-3(maybe 3-4?) and between the two of us we finished probably 1/3 of it. Waiter was attentive to everyone seated, but I'm not really sure why they needed probably 3 girls standing by the entrance talking. As you can tell from other photos it is what I call \"hipster pizza\" since nowhere in the northeast would someone try to pass it off as regular pizza, its a way better California Pizza Kitchen type of pizza.",

Spinato's is not the wood-fired oven style of pizza that is super popular right now, so if that's what you're looking for, try one of other hot spots.  BUT what they do at Spinato's, they do so, so right. This is a Chicago-style pizza (the family is from there originally).  My favorite is the Super Six, but I also really love the L'Italiana.  If you're hungry, try the garlic breadsticks, which are served with a side of marinara sauce.  Finally, in terms of service, I've never had a bad experience.  If you're a pizza lover, I definitely recommend this place.",

The fresh garlic on this pizza catches you by surprise and keeps you coming back for more.  If I could give Spinato's an extra star, I would. And it would be for the following: If you eat in the restaurant, the pizzas are served on top of a cooling rack, on top of a pizza pan. This ensures proper air circulation to the crust. By the time you get to that last slice of pizza (and trust me, there will be no leftovers to speak of) the crust still holds up to the pile of fresh spinach which sits atop it!  I know it's in a seemingly bland industrial park, but I promise you that there is nothing bland about the food. This will be a family favorite for as long as it exists.",

Unfortunately, the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients.  Almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce.  They offer several options (thin crust, thick crust, lite cheese, etc.), so they should do themselves a big favor and offer a choice of sauce options:  traditional tangy Italian or their present sweet.  That would make this Chicago girl be singing their praises!!",

I have super high expectations when it comes to food. Something has to be really really really good to even review it and give it 5 stars.  We had the \"mamma spinatos\" and a \"pepperoni and mushroom\". I hope this review helps if you have any hesitations.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this place.  The service is great and the pizza is very, very good.  Our server was friendly, courteous and checked on us at all the right times.  I would say the price range is average.  It's a super casual place, so you wouldn't look out of place if you walked in there with your hair uncombed wearing sweats. They do not serve alcohol, but they do have a killer brownie and gelato.  The garlic bread appetizer is simple, but yummy.  We had a large pizza with half what I wanted and half what my friend wanted.  The thing I tend to dislike about pizza places (but worth it if the pizza is fantastic) is the wait once you order it.  The pizza was brought to us in about only 10 minutes.  Very impressed with the whole thing.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is first, the tables were too close together.  I'm not loud, but I shouldn't have to whisper either, so there really is no seat in the place to have a private discussion with your party.  I understand they want as much business as they can, but when the lady at the table next to me snickers at something I said, I think it's time to take a table or two out.  Second, I like my crust with a little bit of a crisp or crunch.  This pizza crust was really soft. It might be more a preference issue though, so more of a heads up if you like it the way I like it.   Now, if only they had a small wine selection to complete the package.  :)",

Anyways my family and I were starving so went to yelp and found that this place was less than 5 minutes from the stadium.  The only complaint I have is it's easy to miss this place but besides that the pizza was amazing.  Honestly some of the best I've ever had, no lie.  We ordered the bread with cheese for an appetizer and it was bomb.  When then ordered the family Caesar salad which was good but the pizza.    We got 2 small pizzas, the spinach mama's special and the meaty.  I kinda like spinach but it sounded good so we went with it.   I am so glad we did because I didn't think I could love spinach that much.  I honestly wish I could have another slice now as I type this.  The meaty one was good too.  Some how we saved room for dessert and we got the cannoli and the brownie with ice cream.  Both desserts were great too.   So if you're in the mood for pizza you have to check this place out.  Enjoy!!!!",

The chairs are not comfortable at all. I'm not very tall or big but found myself wiggling around the whole time trying to be comfortable in this metal chair. As we sat there waiting for our food I started noticing that a few of the waiters and waitresses kept touching their hair. One guy with blonde hair repeatedly kept grabbing his hair and then touching peoples food so I was glad he was not my waiter. Then another girl with glasses and a side braid kept grabbing her braid and then touching food. Do they not know that when you work in a restaurant it's not okay to do that. Just really made me re think about coming here again. The food was meh, I like the other locations better. Our garlic bread tasted like regular bread and it was a little over cooked. All in all nice place but between the hair touching and the food I wound rather go to a different location.",

They also offered plates, napkins, forks, Parmesan and crushed red pepper which I appreciated since I was going back to eat in my office. Note: this place is a little difficult to find, especially at night, if you've never been. It's in a warehouse like area, but close to the street.  All in all, an excellent pizza and I'll definitely be back to try more of their pizza creations.",

They also have something that everyone should try.  It may sound unusual, but you'll be a believer after trying it.  The Spaghetti and Meatball calzone!!!  Get it with the ricotta (they have fresh ricotta, not that cheap dry garbage most places use).   It comes covered in sauce and is amazing!

Just an FYI, unlike how traditional pizza's are sliced into triangular slices, Spinato's slices theirs into squares...

We used to go to Grimal**, but their pizzas gets too cold at the table and loose their appeal. I like the sweetness of the Spinato sauce.  We took our newborn their one time and they gave us a free mini T-shirt for the baby!  I always go during lunch because I've heard the crowds get out of hand on the weekend.",

She devoured it, it was crazy. I had a slice and I'm not a huge fan of pineapples on my pizza, but I must say it was definitely tasty. And I finally got to try a pepperoni and jalapeno... \"Got me like 'Oh My Gosh I'm so in love... I found you finally' \"... This is now my #1 favorite pizza on the face of the earth.

I begrudgingly went with iced tea and I'm still bummed about it. I had my 2 year old godson with me and ordered him chicken off the kids menu to later find out they were out of chicken. Bummer.   I, myself, got the artichoke toast, a caesar salad, and pepperoni pizza. The toast and salad were effing fantastic while the pizza was extremely boring. The sauce was lacking.

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Chicago style thin crust pizza. Having a bunch of family in Chicago, I've sampled the real article many, many times.  This place misses the mark.  Overall the pizza is decent; however, the sauce is cloyingly sweet... I don't know who thinks that tastes good, but if they just fixed the sauce, it would instantly elevate the pizza up another level. I'm also pretty sure they don't use whole milk mozzarella either.  Another thing that bugs me is that the way they make pizza here is akin to a soulless assembly line. It's staffed by teenagers, and the pizzas are all built on these scales where they weigh everything. Definitely not made by talented hands.  Last gripe, they use conveyor ovens. These type of ovens produce inferior pizza due to having to use pans, which tend to be think aluminum. The crust doesn't cook on a solid slab of metal or stone like in traditional and wood fired ovens. I've seen places switch to these and quality dipped everytime not to return back to it's original state ever again.  The place is always busy with take out orders, so obviously people like it. Unfortunately, People also like Papa John's, so be wary of all these 4 and 5 star reviews.  Bottom line, will I eat this pizza? Yes, if someone gets it. Will I ever pay for this pizza? No chance in hell.",

Which meant not enough food. The calzones were also missing marinara sauce. We asked the waiter and he said that they came to the window like that so he went with the flow and brought them to us. The manager came over to discuss the sized and was sure they were mediums and did not offer to fix any of it. When leaving they brought out a personal calzone and it was the same size as our \"medium\" calzones. We had to pay for mediums and got smalls.",

    "text": "Sad to be writing this review, as my family and I have loved this pizza place for a couple of years now. I placed a to-go order this past week and had the worst experience, so I don't think it will be our regular place anymore.  For full review disclosure, we always do take-out, we don't really go out to eat for pizza, it's our favorite to have at home with a movie! So I can't comment on the wait service.  I placed my order by phone, for the Marghertia pizza, which I have had some version of at a lot of pizza places. There was a little bit of confusion about the order, but that was no problem, I added one extra veggie topping and then was given my total, which I think was higher than it should have been (I ordered a small which is 12\") and it came to over $16. I was told they raised their prices after the new year, but hadn't updated their online menu yet. I picked up the pizza and with tip it came to just under $20 for a 12\" pizza with tomato, basil, and mushrooms.  I got home, and it turns out it wasn't pizza - even though it is listed under their popular pizza combos. It's flatbread basically with dried out dough. There was no pizza sauce, which was not disclosed on the menu or during the longer phone ordering.  I called about a day and a half later to just give them a heads up for quality assurance reasons, but the person who took my call was pretty rude. She said that of course it doesn't come with sauce, and I pointed out that's not on the menu or told to customers when they are ordering, so maybe it's a little confusing for customers, and maybe they could add that. She said that ALL of their pizzas that come with sauce say they come with sauce on the menu (they don't by the way, I'm going to try to see if I can attach two screenshots from their menu) and then she informed me that olive oil is a sauce (sorry to say it's not actually). I pointed out it's not really a sauce, but it could still be great drizzled on top of a normal pizza, and hopefully they can make it less confusing for their customers when they update their menu next. I got a terse response of \"ok. Thank you.\" in the way you know someone's not actually saying thank you, before she ended the call.  It's been a fun family-owned type place in the past, but we will be looking elsewhere and trying some new places this year!!!",

In fact I can't really give an honest overall review of Spinatos because 4 years ago the first time we tried it we ordered the Super Six and we haven't ever ordered anything else. I know I know that's good and bad. Maybe there is something else??  First of all the biggest impression I had of the pizza was the higher quality than other places. Each bite explains what I mean instantly. There are 10$ even 20$ pizzas then there's the Super Six. (23$) It's worth the extra $$$. The pizza crust is flaky not to soft not to crispy. The veggies are fresh and flavorful and there is just enough cheese in every slice. We have ordered that pie at least 100 times and every time it's excellent. Eventually one day we will try something else........maybe. :)",

I asked and got a great recommendation on the $9 Calzone and it was absolutely fantastic and came quickly.  Ricotta cheese, onions, 3 types of peppers and that thin, wonderful crunchy crust.  I hadn't a Calzone this phenomenal in years.  The crust was light and tasty and they included Au Jus which was a different but nice touch  I did taste the pizza the guys ordered and I understand some of the Yelp comments about the tomato sauce being too sweet.  I still enjoyed the pizza but if you don't care for sweet spicey tomato sauce I would highly recommend the Calzone",

Also, we showed up without a reservation on a Saturday for supper and we seated within 30 minutes.  Easily the best pizza in the county, maybe even the state!",

    "text": "I'm writing this review based on the North Phoenix location, as this is the one the Company has claimed.  Ordered 2 small pizzas last night instead of a large half and half.  The very friendly girl on the phone, I think her name is Hanna gave me a slightly different price than what I figured (which is no big deal, because I ordered anyway), and she put her manager on the phone who is Marvin.  I explained that I'm a nerd a found a .pdf menu in the search results that were not published on the site, and he promptly is a very friendly demeanor said well we did have a 6% price increase due to the minimum wage increase.  Excellent answer!  I'm not a cheap person by any means, as 2 smalls were $27, I just needed clarification and he was spot on!  Next, we get the food.  HOLY FOODGASM!!!  It's been a while since I've had Spinato's, but holy crap!  I had the small deep dish Chicago, and the sauce was a special kind of sweet, and those mixed sweet peppers were to die for!  The other pie was Nicole's original favorite, which I don't like artichokes thus the 2 small pies, and my guest loved it!.  Originally being from Chicago, I am a pizza snob and these guys nailed it!  Screw you Rosati's which is closer to my house,  Spinato's won me over (again)!!!",

It had the perfect mix of ingredients, from the tangy-sweet tomato sauce, the fresh spinach and tomatoes, the nicely browned cheese, with a bite from the freshly chopped garlic.

I'm not impressed since all the meat was in the center and not to the edge, if I wanted cheese bread, I would have ordered that.  The mushrooms and onions were not fully cooked.  Since we own a bakery that was voted #1 for 19 years in a row, I know a little about restaurants.  My friend was embarrassed, the manager did give us 1/2 off the Calzone.  The Caesar side salad was great.  If you order the Chicago Calzone I would get with their sauce at least to dip in, it would be better than the AuJus sauce.  If you come to Yuma try Bernardo's in the foothills you will be glad you did, their steak bomb Stromboli is off the hook.",

We got there at a pretty decent time so the wait was about 10min.  Friends and I order side salads (Greek & a caesar) and a medium Chicago Pizza! It was amazing! We inhaled our food (we were pretty hungry since our last meal was brunch)  Service is amazing. Mary (I think) was our server. She was super friendly and really makes sure you're enjoying yourself.

    "text": "Tonight we paid $50 for pizza... Here's how:  We wanted to buy dinner for my Father and he is a fan of the bake-at-home style that we have tried from other places in the past. We are huge fans of the sauce here and were excited to try their version of the bake-at-home. We dropped off a 3/4 cooked pizza at the house for pops to start and ran to go get drinks while it cooked... We came back to a kitchen full of smoke and my Father panicking :( We thought that the inner liner under the pizza was the provided cooking sheet.. This was not the case. My Father couldn't get is out on his own and was afraid of it catching everything on fire. We help him get it out and it was completely inedible, cardboard lining scorched with ash and pieces throughout the pie, and our oven destroyed.   I called and told them what happened and said I needed another one and they placed a second order. We get to the place and are charged for a second pie.   Don't get me wrong the oven incident was our fault (minus the lack of proper cook-at-home product), but we had another small incident from this location the last time we ordered from here that was quite revealing of their business practices. I ordered two sides of their sauce and was only given one. When I told them about the last incident today, they ignored my concern, charged me for two again and assured me that they would make sure I received all sauces THIS time.   The second pizza was as good as usual, but they were not concerned about my experience in either situation. I wonder if their business objective is customer centric or more about maximizing working capital. They have lost both in us.",

I had been hearing good things for many years and for whatever reason, just didn't get into any of the Metro Phoenix locations. Well, I'm so glad I finally did and can say it's one of my favorites. We ordered a large Caesar Salad and an 18\" thin crust pie with the regular tomato sauce. I tried to talk our party into pesto, but was outnumbered. I have to say, the tomato sauce is very sweet. I don't think I've tasted a sauce quite like it on a pizza. The dough and ingredients are perfect together and its evident that once you try this pizza, you'll more than likely be hooked. Next time, I'm looking forward to trying the pie with pesto sauce as well and maybe even comparing the two side by side.",

The location is kinda remote; I understand it is the home location where they make their pizzas for all locations, making sure they are the same style and taste at all locations. This location is rather small with a casual vibe. That made it perfect for us since we have a child who can get too much stimulation and stress out. They also have gluten free choices, which fit our family well. I had the Greek salad and it was good also. The only drawback was that they don't have the kids' menu, but that was easily solved with sharing. There is also no alcohol served at this location.",

So order slowly - one piece is the size of two paper plates. If your order cheese bread expect to take it home as it is a full pie. Service is solid and you will be taking food home. Not your normal pizza place - super New York this and the Tuscany is very thick. Great food at a cheap price. Start slowly here as the sizes of just a slice will fill you up. Outstanding - good looking crowd! Bring this to Vegas ASAP!!'",

But you can sit at the bar if you want lol. I've never really been too worried about welcoming but these two girls were just rude. Ruined my chance to eat there. Now I'll never come back.

The servers didn't seem knowledgeable on the menu and overall just didn't seem to care. Had quite a few questions about the menu items that had changed, which seemed to irritate my server. Had one encounter with an employee (female with tattoos) who made it seem her conversation with the other employee was more important than taking care of my concerns. Overall the staff just didn't treat my guests and I like family. Once we finally got the food it was mediocre at best. Also, paying almost $20 for a pasta, couldn't believe it! We will take our business elsewhere in the future.",

The sauce is rather unique with a sweetness not usually found in most pizzas. This was a good quality pizza which was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. The delivery person was polite and courteous. I am intreested in ordering other items from the menu next time. Oh yah, there WILL be a next time!",

Don't waste your time or get fooled by the modern decor, go to peter piper instead! Update!!! Almost didn't make it home before the food needed to exit!!

Cheese is delicious and the butter crust has a nice flavor.  The only critique I have is the crust was a little softer than I like on a thin crust.   Their pizza is pretty expensive for carry out and even though its worth every penny, it's a bit disappointing because 2 large thin crust  pizzas for carry out would be about $45.  That's way too much!  If they were a little less expensive, I'd be there once a week!",

I joined a group of friends for dinner or I might have never discovered this quaint little restaurant. I decided as this was my first visit to go with the pizza choices of those who had been before. We shared a thick crust half  Mamma Spinato's signature fresh spinach , and  half  Get Meaty special. Their sauce is significantly sweeter than most places but the flavor is good as was the pizza. The crust however thick was a bit dry and crunchy at the ends, perhaps overdone just a bit. They do however offer thin crust as well as Gluten free which is a bonus for some. It did take a little long for our food to come out but our server was very attentive and managed our group of twelve without any issues. I ordered the Holy Cannoli, crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside it was a perfectly delicious way to end the meal.",

Spinato's has the best pizza in the Valley. Only better I've ever had was for $1 on a corner in New York.   They have gluten-free options. My boyfriend swears by their sandwiches, but I refuse to try them because I just love the pizza too much. We also get the cheesy GF bread sometimes and it's delicious. They can even make gluten-free food taste amazing.   Weird location, but they deliver!",

To be honest when I first arrived I didnt think I was at the right place we were in some industrial park, total hole in the wall type feel. But man I crave their pizza all the time now, in fact I pray that they bring one of these to Utah and I promise they would be the best pizza joint in town. Great food, great price.",

When it comes to takeout pizza, Spinato's is at the top of our list but we were faced with the pining question: What location is closest? We decided that this location was the best choice and made our way down to this hidden pizza gem within an industrial setting.   This Spinato's doesn't have the frills but it has the food! The delicious sweet sauce, the heavenly sausage and the fluffy bread. I gobble up every bite and I'm sad when it's over! It's best to ask for extra sauce because their sauce is their signature taste. The pizza is also perfect for left-overs so I suggest getting a larger one so you have some for the next day! We got the bruschetta to start and really enjoyed the fluffy bread and flavorful tomatoes and peppercinis.   I love this pizza and think everyone in the Valley should try it because they will fall in love too!",

Being the pizza lover that I am how could I go wrong seeing how I can eat pizza in a chair or with a bear I could eat pizza anywhere I love it so much! So entering the restaurant it has a great feel dim lighting, plenty of tables and a bar which I was pleasantly surprised by! We were seated promptly and you have a choice of indoor or outdoor seating which is nice. David was our waiter and he was great. We ordered drinks and artichoke dip, fettuccini Alfredo, and a pepperoni pizza. Drinks were good so was artichoke dip and fettuccini. Pizza oh boy, I couldn't finish one slice the pizza sauce is so sweet like a dessert I could barely swallow the bite I did take. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for pizza, you will be highly disappointed.",

We ordered two small pizzas, the Salsiccia di pollo and the Spicy Italian, to split between 3 people and it was a great amount of food for us. Our server warned us that the salsiccia is a different, \"healthier\" pizza and it definitely showed, there wasn't very much taste given that it's topped with olive oil instead of sauce. To balance out the health we also ordered the spicy Italian which is basically just meat with meat and red sauce and I loved it. The crust also really stood out to me as I thought it had a very interesting texture, more crumbly? than typical pizza crust is. I was diggin it. I'll definitely be back to try out some of their other menu items.",

As far as the pizza, one of the best.  Crust was thin and toppings a plenty.  I first had two squares of the Get Meaty cause it looked good.  I wouldn't say best ever but at least top 5.    I took a piece of the Chicken Presto Pesto and my mind was blown.  I have tasted this type of pizza from other places but they wouldn't be able to hold up against the taste of this one.  Again the crust was thin and crispy.  There was a lot of chicken but not over loaded.  The artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes worked with swirl of basil pesto sauce that was spread across the pie.  I ended up eating 4 more squares.  Like I said, the crust would probably better if we ate it there but the quality of the pizza sauce and toppings didn't disappoint.",

It's not uncomfortable, however, and the service is prompt and friendly.  The pizza is good too, served on a wire rack above a metal pan, which keeps its thin crust from getting soggy. Ample toppings and cheese are fine, too, although I wish they offered bacon.  The sauce is tasty but sweet, which is kind of old-fashioned, but entirely to my taste.  If you like it that way, you won't be able to do much better than Spinato's.  Hint: I've also had their carry out, but like all pizzas, its much better fresh and hot.",

There's not a huge dining area inside so sometimes there's a wait, but it's worth it.  We always get the super six pizza, even though we aren't lovers of peppers... that pizza is amazing!

Ordered delivery and had a nice, smiling and polite gent deliver within the hour.   The salad was great and the pizza was awesome.  I got a small pepperoni and mushroom, thin crust.  The crust was just a little sweet - not too light and not too heavy.  It was the perfect compliment to the awesome cheese and sauce.  I don't know what mushrooms they use, but they were not supermarket white mushrooms.   I wish we had one in Austin - seriously.",

We were a party of 7 & were seated immediately by a super friendly hostess. The manager Tim came over to tell us our server would be right with us and he would get us drinks while we waited which I thought was great! THEN...we met Maria- She was awesome! I've been waiting tables for about 20 years and seriously....that's some of the best service I've ever had. Anyways, we tried 3 pizzas. The original cheese Sicilian, the Hawaiian and the Mamma Italia with spinach and feta etc..They were all a hit. (except for I personally didn't like the original sauce, just too sweet for me). We got the antipasto salad for the table. Tons of meats and cheeses, pepperoccinis, tomatoes, olives etc...My niece was doing her math assignment online and flagged down a young man around her age, Brad, to help her with it and he didn't even flinch, he just jumped right in to help her, (although, I think they were flirting). We tried the gelato, the chocolate chip cookies, and the apple pie crostini dessert. All very good. It was such a great experience that I'm really looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "I've been eating Spinato's pies since before it was Spinato's; in 1977 their location was at 68th St and McDowell (36 years, OMG I'm old).  I forget the name of the place at the time (Aurelio's!), but I haven't forgotten the fantastic pizza.  When they moved to the almost hidden location on Smith in Tempe, I was heartbroken that they were no longer in my 'hood.  Now there are multiple locations, so one of them has to be near you, and some of them deliver now, too.  Go, get some for yourself, no need to thank me.  I like the thin crust.  Yes, the tomato sauce has a delectable sweetness to it that people either love or hate.  I'm a fan.  My favorite combo is Canadian bacon, onions, and mushrooms, unfortunately canned shrooms, but I still like them, baked \"well-done\" since I'm also a fan of browned cheese.  The large version of this pizza goodness runs about $22, so it's not inexpensive by any means, but I'll pay that for what I consider to be the best pizza of its kind in the Valley.  I nearly always get takeout, having eaten in the restaurant maybe 2 or 3 times in all these years.  I love that their caller ID system also brings up my last order, so if you usually order the same pizza it couldn't be easier.  The salads are OK/average; sandwiches are OK; the spaghetti calzone is pretty good and as big as your head, though it sounds kind of odd.  Cannolis are crunchy (if you eat them before too long) with a very mildly sweet ricotta filling, don't know if they make them in house or not, and they're kind of forgettable.  If you require ethanol with your meal, go to one of the other locations as you won't find any for sale here; maybe BYOB?  Call and ask.  Sign up at their website and you can get some specials and discounts in your email every now and then.  So, let's see, what excuse can I come up with to be near one of their locations late this afternoon...",

I am dairy-free, soy-free, egg-free, and gluten-free, as well as, poultry and beef-free, so finding a place that could accommodate my diet is sometimes hard to find!  However, Spinato's definitely took care of me!    I had the Traditional Vegetarian gluten-free pizza and it was awesome.  I arrived early on a Friday night before the crowds started rolling in, and my waitress was awesome.  She actually tried the gluten-free pizza and was able to offer some commentary.  Anyways, the pizza was  very flavorful, so much so that I could not stop eating it!  The golden brown, thin and crispy crust topped with a variety of sweet peppers, mushrooms and onions definitely makes this pizza a hit!    So, if you are looking for a family-friendly environment with great customer service, and gluten-free options, consider Spinato's Pizzeria and submit to \"The Spinato Experience\".",

We typically eat at the Tempe location, though I work in Scottsdale and frequent that location as well. It's hard not to order the pizza, but I've also tried the meatball sandwich and the pasta which are both also very good. My wife loves the spaghetti and meatball calzone and often makes a meal of that and a salad (we also love their homemade Italian dressing). The sauce is amazing and all of the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The wait staff is very friendly, and even remember us and our tendencies (they've even busted me on eating at both locations in the same day). We introduce all of our friends and family to Spinato's whenever they're in town or looking for a place to eat, and nobody we've brought has had a single negative thing to say about it.

Ordered a large half spinach and half special 6, along with a side order of meatballs.  The time quoted was ~ 1 hr, which was fine with us.  The pizza was at our door in 1/2 the time! Bonus points for that.  The pizza was hot, but the crust was a little limp, not crispy. It may have been from sitting in the box?  Good quality toppings. Be prepared to be assaulted by the amount of garlic that is on the spinach pizza! They are definitely generous with it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the sauce is different from your typical joint - it's sweet. I'm not sure how I felt about it, but I ended up eating a bunch of it, so it's not  bad, it's just a surprise.  The special 6 was awesome!   Meatball order came with 3, and covered with sauce. It was very beefy, and good sized. Enjoyed that as well.  Overall, prompt service with better-than-expected pizza.  Maybe add some wings on the menu? Pretty please?",

We were checked on by our server frequently. The location is a little hard to find, as there is no prominent sign visible from the street, but this wasn't  enough to give less than five stars. We started with the garlic mozzarella bread and meatball trio appetizers, both delicious and hot. The combo pizza was spectacular (and HUGE. When they say \"large\", they mean it!) and the cannoli were the crown jewel of the meal; delicious, perfectly portioned, reasonably priced,  and beautifully presented. We found our new pizza joint!",

I really like Oregano's, but they are better known for their specialty pizzas and when I crave sausage pizza they aren't my number one choice. I've never actually eaten in-shop as I always pick it up and take it home, but they are prompt and I've never had to wait for it to finish. There is seriously something addicting in their sweet sauce, because you definitely start to crave it after a while. I wasn't quite sure the first time I had it, but I've quickly come to love the taste.  I tend to go between the Mama's Signature, the Combo, and the Sausage and Peppo, but I've never had a bad pizza. Way better than the chains! I've found it even reheats better than most.",

When we walked in we were greeted with a wonderful smell, the restaurant definitely has a good feel, there was a pretty long wait but that's to be expected with the size of the restaurant in a busy part of Tempe so we're okay with it. after we got seated we ordered the garlic bread with melted mozzarella cheese, it was fantastic and we were very eager to try our pizza. Wish I could say the euphoria lasted. the pizza was not great, not saying it was gross, but it was basically just a fancy Totino's pizza. not unpleasant just not what it promised to be. if you love totinos give it a try you may find that it is right up your alley, but it was really just a big disappointment and it did not live up to the hype for us.",

    "text": "Spinato's is a hip little Chicago style pizza joint located between industrial complexes just south of Tempe Marketplace. It's like a hole-in the wall, but once inside, you're treated to high ceiling, brick wall, cute music, trendy art, and romantic lighting. The seating is limited but there's a back room and willingness to hold a large party. I've never been here where seating was an issue, so I think they have adequate space.  I've been here twice, once with a large group for lunch (6+), and once with a small group for dinner (5). It was comfortable, inviting, and the food tasted very good. The desert was also tasty. The pizza takes a little while to come out but it's well worth the wait.  The environment makes this place a 5. It's very inviting. The waitress was having her first day and was still a sweetheart and split a check 3 ways. The other time, we just got great, consistent service. They also have crushed ice, if that means anything to you. It's so good! Huge cups.  The location is funny, but there's plenty of parking. It is easy to miss if you're going north, but easy to see if you're going south. It's in a complex with a lot of industrial business, so there's sufficient, clearly marked parking.  You'll have a good time. Perfect for a date.",

    "text": "Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a \"New York\" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.  Slices just has their \"NY\" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do \"NY\" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an \"NY\" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.  On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order \"eat-in\". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept.   The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian \"Traditional Vegetarian\" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices.   This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.  This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14\" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market.",

I read a lot of good things about Spinato's, so I figured why not.   I checked out the menu online. While I was happy to see they have online ordering, I was disappointed to discover that at 2.33 miles away, I could only pick up my order. I decided to go ahead and make a pick up order anyway. I will say that Spinato's web site is great to order from. It offers up several options about what you can add to the pizza and how you want them to bake it. I went ahead and went with a lil' \"signature\" fresh spinach, and an order of garlic bread.   The garlic bread was a big disappointment. It tasted no different than something you'd pick up and toast at any grocery store.  The pizza was pretty good, but not worth driving out to pick up. I'm also not a big fan of the sweet sauce.   I'd be willing to give Spinato's another try if I were going to eat out. But if I'm going for take out, there's a few better options in the South Scottdales/North Tempe area.",

    "text": "This pizza is seriously addicting and sooo soooooooooo yummy!! I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and I've eaten it in almost every state I've ever been to (30+) and this restaurant is definitely in my top 5. My first time there, I ordered the L'Italiana with pepperoni. Normally I only eat 2, maybe 3 slices, but this particular time, I ate half the pizza and had my stomach not been so full, I probably would've kept going. I literally could only think about Spinatos pizza until I got it again a couple weeks later, this time ordering Nicole's New Favorite, which like my first order, proved to be incredibly savory and delicious.  Now for the 4/5 star review.... just over a month ago, my boyfriend and I were driving around and decided we wanted pizza (it was a Thursday night, for the record). We were in the Spinatos area and since it's all I could seem to think about when thinking \"pizza,\" we stopped in about 8:15pm (they close at 9pm). We were going to order our pizza 'to go' but instead we stood in the main entrance for just over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by anybody. The people in the kitchen were visibly cleaning, occasionally looking at us, and servers were still going to tables but nobody came to speak with us, although they too looked at us. We ended up getting really frustrated and leaving. It's hard to say why we were ignored, considering the place was only 50% crowded and they still had 45 minutes until closing time. Either way, I was upset with the service and have yet to go back. I almost gave them a lower review but since my previous experiences there had been positive and the pizza is seriously that good, I thought knocking off just 1 star seemed legit. Anyway, if you want some of the BEST pizza you will ever eat, seriously go here! Just be careful going too late or you may not get served at all.",

We usually get take out, and the pizza is just as good the next day. What makes Spinato's unique, is the pizza sauce.

But ooooh is it worth it. OMG we ate there in March and still talk about how great the pizza was.  The sauce...omg the sauce, we wanted to drink it, it was soooo good.  The boys shared the \"Get Meaty\", while I had the Signature Fresh Spinach ...oh my.  The staff was very friendly.  The host at the door was awesome. We were in with a table on a busy Saturday night in 1/3 of the time he quoted us.  We were thrilled. Definitely recommend !!!",

I was torn between 4 and 5, the only reason I docked a star is because of the price tag, it's on the steep side. My favorite is their \"Da Greek\" pizza, without onions of course! It's flavorful blend of spinach, olives, feta and spices is simply delicious. I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, always take it to go and the pizza is still warm and flavorful! Second day leftovers are delicious as well, it makes for great cold pizza.",

My appetizer caprese salad was not good.  Tomatoes were ok, mozzarella was the cheap stuff you get at the supermarket, dressing was bland and the artichokes were hard.   I also ordered the chicken parm.  A very small portion of chicken arrived with cheese, thick crust of breading and very sweet sauce.  Even though I did not get pizza it was a very thin crust served on a wire rack.  The pizza at the mall or airport looked better.  Looking into the kitchen as I was leaving I saw a conveyor belt pizza oven, like the ones used at Dominos and other fast-food pizza places.  Thankfully I did not order pizza.  Not sure what people are so excited about this place.  There are some many great pizza places here in Phoenix.  My suggestion, pass on this place.",

Unfortunately there was a group of 25 ahead of us that made our wait interminable, waiting over an hour to be seated is  unacceptable at a pizza place. To add insult to injury a group who came in after us got seated. At that point I knew waiting longer was futile and we left (after being there about 1.5 hours) to enjoy a meal elsewhere. As this was my first experience at this restaurant, I can say that I probably won't try again as the customer service was lacking. When the front stand says they are sorry for their mistake of seating someone ahead of you one would expect some sort of contrition, an offered appetizer or drink, or something, instead we left hungry and frustrated. Thanks but no thanks.",

The decor inside wasn't too over the top and the patio was nice and spacious. Definitely a step up from the little hole in the wall down the road!  The food we ordered was just as we remember from the old store, with the addition of wings! (It was nice to see new menu items on the menu)The pizza sauce still has the perfect amount of sweet. Overall, the food came out hot and did not let down. The only thing bringing down my review was the poor service. The waitress, Alex, was not at all attentive. She almost seemed annoyed to even have us in her section. We did not feel the \"family\" atmosphere from the staff. With so many restaurants opening up around the valley, service is a big point to hit. We will definitely give this location another shot, but with such a beautiful store, spinatos should step up their hiring game.  Great food can be soiled by poor service, hence the 3 star review.",

The next night weather learned and came earlier and only had a short wait. They have a nice text message waiting service so you can wait outside or in your car.   Great vibe to this restaurant. Everyone who greeted us/waitress was very nice, and you could tell this is a Family-friendly restaurant, mom-and-pop style. We both got calzones. As someone who grew up in NY (me), and my husband (outside Chicago), we thought the calzones were OK. My cream vodka sauce was so sweet I almost wanted to salt it. Maybe just a fluke night. I will definitely try again if we are back in the area though.",

I was in Tempe and thought hmm I should go to the original Spinato's. It wasn't busy when we got in. We were seated promptly. We then ordered a pepperoni pizza and a chicken ceasar salad. Pizza came out nice and hot. We took a bite and we weren't stoked. The pizza was way to greasy. The sauce was too sweet. It was overpowering with sweetness that I could hardly taste anything else. The salad was also a disappointment. The chicken was really cold (like just out of the fridge cold) and the salad overall tasted exactly like Costco ceasar salad. I mean there is nothing wrong with Costco salad, I love Costco but their salad costs only $3.95. This salad costs $13 so I expected a little bit more.  Overall, we weren't impressed at all. We are not sure if we continue to be their frequent customers.",

Major turn off is the choice of Pepsi products instead of Coke. \"No, Pepsi is not ok. How about if I fucked your wife.\"  For the appetizer I had garlic bread with Mozzarella. It was fantastic. The side marinara sauce was to die for.  Overall 5/5  The pizza was cheesy goodness. With Canadian bacon, diced garlic and onions the pizza was the best I've had in Tempe. Extremely high rate. Overall 4.5/5  The dessert was a brownie Bella. \"Homemade brownie, salted caramel, and chocolate sauces with choice of gelatos.\" At an affordable $3.95 it  can't be beat. Best dessert I've had at a restaurant. Overall 5/5  Restaurant rating: 5/5.   A definite go to if you are in the mood for high quality Italian food.   Thanks for reading.   Until next time.",

    "text": "I was in town for business and was craving pizza to take back to the hotel. I ordered a thin crust Chicago and a side greek salad. The salad was actually really very good, and the home made dressing was surprisingly delish. The pizza wasn't very thin in my books (I was looking for a cracker-thin crust), and there was just way too much cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but it was to the point of you-can't-see-the-toppings-toomuch-cheese. Also, they had forgotten to cut my pizza lol. No big, I had silverware from my salad, but who forgets to cut a pizza?  If you're looking for a sweeter sauce and to support a family-run pizzeria, this is the place for you. I'd come back again if I'm craving a regular crust pizza, just not the thin.",

So far every pizza I have tried has been delicious! They are reasonably quick considering they business they pull in! For the quality they bring I would say they are affordable.  The only somewhat negative thing I can say is that their red sauce is a bit on the sweet side so if you are not a fan of that, watch out!",

We had a Greek salad and a medium pizza. The salad dressing was so overwhelming that you didn't even notice any of the flavor present from the feta and other vegetables in the salad. The pizza was reminiscent of what my elementary school served. Overly sweet sauce and a very squishy, spongy, floppy pizza dough. We had a meatball, pepperoni and red onion pizza that featured crumpled meatball and nary a pepperoni. I can tell you the flavors we unidentifiable because the sauce was so sweet. A medium pizza and a happy hour Greek salad ran $27. Save your money and go to MOD or one of the other numerous choices for pizza in the area.",

I didn't even know Spinato's was there and very close to Tempe Marketplace, I just thought this was an industrial area.  This Spinato's has an opened feeling to it, its rustic yet industrial, guess so it can fit in its surroundings.  I also learned this location does not sell beer or wine or whatever booze they happen to have for sale at other locations.    I was running a little behind but I did get to sample the signature pizza, it had baby spinach, fresh roma tomatoes, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese, thick crust. This was a great pizza, simple but delish! The pizza sauce is on the sweeter side, not savory, but I personally happen to like it I also happen to be a fan of thick crust pizza as well, I'm not too crazy about thin crust, so this pizza was perfect in my book!    Service was great and food was good! Look forward to trying it again.",

Inside, the setting is simple and very informal, and lighting is at a comfortably low, relaxing level. Service is efficient and friendly, and of course the pizza is quite good. A big plus for me is that people with gluten restrictions can opt for a gluten-free crust, which means I can come here with a group and enjoy pizza like everyone else. I guess the only grouse I have about the place is that parking can be tricky during peak hours.",

We have only tried the pizza here so far but it has been consistently good.

The flavor... the texture... oh God.  Salads, breadsticks, cheesesticks, and calzones are also amazing.  And TRY the pumpkin gelato that's seasonal--it's TO DIE for. Also, great, quick, friendly service.  They box everything up for you, and offer you giant to-go cups for your drinks even.  My mouth is watering right now.",

Our all time favorite and every time order is the Homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni. We love this place sooo much that we held our wedding reception at the Ahwatukee location (thanks John!) and we have turned a few guests in to long term customers.  Today I order for delivery from the Tempe location for a work luncheon. The way they cut the pie in to small square pieces fed 12 hungry adults with 3 pizzas! The delivery was right on-time and the food was still hot. They included plates and forks for our team and I think they realized I hadn't ordered enough drinks (I got 4 20oz drinks for all 12 of us) so they threw in a few extra!  The customer service at both the Tempe and Ahwatukee location is top notch and the pizza is the best in the valley! Thanks for being our number one pizza joint!",

Best pizza I've had in awhile.  As a fan of Chicago pizza (my in-laws are from the Windy City) I always stick with limited toppings, one of which must be sausage. This time out, we did sausage and spinach, and it was awesome. The spinach is \"mama's recipe,\" where there's a secret ingredient. (The secret ingredient is garlic. Lots of garlic - and that's a good thing.)  This place is tucked away into an industrial park, so it can be hard to find. It's also rather small, and can get quite crowded. Expect a wait during busy periods. It's also BYOB.",

Actually, had it been across Rio Salado in the Tempe Marketplace, we would not have tried it, because I HATE HATE HATE Tempe Marketplace, but that's another story.   We got the thin crust option with italian sausage, mushrooms and olives. So good!! like other reviewers said, the sauce is unbelievable. I wish I knew their secret.

If you want soggy pizza go to Oregano's... Worst pizza EVER!!! Yes, the sauce is a bit on the sweet side and not for people used to cheep @#$& pizza. Yes, the place is small but would you rather have something mass produced, frozen and reheated like most fast food pizza places that sell for $5? Solve that problem by calling ahead!

Their pizza is orgasmic, and that's not a word I throw around often.  However, a few downers, one they are still doing construction work in the restaurant in Tempe but get over it, the pizza makes up for the way it looks!

    "text": "Pineapple and pepperoni with extra sauce. I know it sounds weird, but it's a great combination at Spinato's. The sauce is boss, and I can't get over how perfectly chewy and crisp the crust is.  While at Spinato's, I was treated to a display of the restaurant's outstanding service. A table of business diners were upset because one had asked for cheese after receiving a calzone and didn't realize that meant making a whole new calzone. Instead of appreciating the lengths Spinato's will go to provide a fresh, delicious meal, she shrieked, \"Can't you just throw some cheese on top?\" And her pal was mad because he asked for sweet peppers and then ate his sandwich before the peppers arrived.   To the servers' credit, they comped a few items, boxed what couldn't be waited for and apologized profusely. I wouldn't have handled it so well.  So, for me, Spinato's doesn't compare with Pino's, but we're talking a different style of pizza. I certainly will be back when in Arizona.",

    "text": "When I walked in the door and saw that the Pizza Oven was one of those conveyor belt ovens I should have gone with my gut feeling and walked away. A real Chicago Pizza is made in an oven with a stone shelf and you need either a pan or peel to get it in and out of the oven.  The hype on the website talks about how the owners wanted to bring Chicago pizza to Phoenix. I have never had Pizza like this in Chicago.   Was it better than Pizza Hut or Barro's? Yes. Was it better than Oregano's or Rosati's. No!  We first ordered an Anti-Pasto Salad with mixed greens. It was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some Italian Meats and Cheeses. Lots of sliced Green and Black Olives and a couple of Peperoncini. Not impressed. Oregano's wins this one hands down.  The pizza. We ordered a Peperoni, Mushroom and Black Olive Pizza. The most notable thing was that the sauce was very sweet, too sweet. Now I've had a sweet sauce ad liked it but this one was overpowering. I prefer a more tart sauce with a more oregano and basil flavor with some spice.  The cheese was good but the mushrooms were canned. The crust was more like a biscuit dough and it was more buttery and flaky than crispy.  If you want a Thin Crust Chicago Pizza with a slightly sweet sauce I would recommend Johnie\"s Chicago Pizza on Cave Creek.  Spinato's has Coke and Johnie's has Pepsi and I would go to Johnie's anytime even though he has Pepsi.   To say the least I was very disappointed with Spinato's when there is an Oregano's less than 3 miles away.  One other thing. I ordered my son a Kids Pizza, Drink Dessert and instead of giving me the Kids price they charged me the separate price because they did not see me order it off the kids menu. I asked WTF and they did adjust it when I complained.  To give you an idea of the Chicago Pizza I like for those of you from Chicago to rate my taste here they are. Lou Malnati's or Original Due's Barnaby's. Village Inn, Home Run Inn. Edwardo's, Bacino's. Gigo's Evanston.   In Chicago Rosati's would barely make my list but in Phoenix it's near the top, only second to Oregano's. I do not like anybody's Pan Pizza in Phoenix.  I did forget one thing that was actually very good. The Gelato that came with my son's meal. It was really good. Really good. Not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though. I have been told the Italian Beef is really good. The same person who told me the pizza was good is the person who said that so I'm not really sure if I want to chance it. What do you think?",

Went here for lunch today, with my partner and I, order a gluten free pizza: all pineapple, half shrooms,  and half pepperoni. Normally it comes out prefect! But not all masterpieces come out accident free. Ours came out with a head twist reaction and we didn't even have a chance to comment because our wonderful server immediately informed us that we would be getting a complementary pizza! Same exact one as we ordered! SCORE! Guess who didn't have to make dinner tonight!?  Even though the bite was just as magical as the others have been,  thank you Spinato's for being awesome and going above and beyond! Definitely a GREAT experience!",

I highly recommend trying the spaghetti calzone sm size and Wrigley sandwich :) everything is pretty amazing.  after 5 years I've still not found a better pizza place.  Also Maria, one of the staff is a True sweetheart.  She's honest, happy and a breath of sweet family everytime I see her :)  if you're there on Tues you'll have the pleasure of seeing her!",

However, I was in the neighborhood and remembered that there was a Spinato's around here.  I started getting relapses. I needed that GF Combo Pizza with Jalapenos!  I hoped and prayed that the service here will be better than the last 80 horrible times at the one on 7th st.    We walked in a fairly empty restaurant since it was past lunch time, before dinner time. Our waitress was phenomenal - attentive, friendly, and funny!  The pizza is still good!  I almost feel ashamed that I went back to Spinato's. I was planning to not even write a review because I was that ashamed - but look, I'm a yelper and not just any yelper, I'm an elite yelper so it's my duty!  This location does it right - food and customer service!",

So I was thinking I'd run by Tempe Marketplace for a few things after a ridiculously long day and then pick up dinner from my favorite place afterwards.   I called to place my order and was helped by an incredibly helpful, friendly gal. Wish I got her name... She assured me my food would be waiting for me in  30. Awesome! Plenty of time for a quick stop at the Bev Mo! And hey! There's an Ulta right there, isn't there? I need hairspray... By the time I pick up dinner I'm late, annoyed and HUNGRY! I'm greeted warmly, served quickly and am on my way.   Excited to get home, relax and enjoy some wine and great food. Open the bags to discover there's no dressing for my Greek salad and the caprese isn't what I expected. Lame.  I seriously hate being a complainer, even when justified. I called and explained the lack of dressing situation with the manager, Leslie. She insisted on having the dressing delivered to me and within 10 minutes, Matt arrives with more than I'd asked for and with cookies.   I'm still quite shocked. Not once did anyone argue or make me feel like I was being annoying. Their primary focus was making sure I was happy and enjoyed my overall experience. Clearly customer service at it's finest.   It's not just the amazing food that sets Spinatos apart. They truly care and you can tell.",

The salads are okay.  I wasn't a fan, but it was an obligatory salad in preparation of feeling guilty for the next week or so cause of all the Thanksgiving feasting, so I ate it anyway.  We got the signature spinach pizza along with the meaty pizza, both in mediums, and it fed the 5 of us quite well (and trust me, we know how to feast).  The slices are cut in little squares which make it real easy to lose track of how many slices you've had.  That, and the fact that their pizzas have this delicious sweet sauce, giving their pizzas a unique taste you can only get at Spinato's.  And they are good.  So good that my boyfriend's brother came out from California last year to visit us, fell in love with Spinato's, and this year, made it a point to stop by Spinato's again this trip.  Definitely stop by if you haven't tried them already!",

We noticed this new place up on the hillside and stopped by to check it out. I had heard of the name before but never been to their other location. We were pleasantly surprised to be told the wait on Friday evening was 45 mins, but then got sat in 8 mins after a couple of no-shows were called by the hostess.   The menu here has A TON of gluten-free options and alternatives, including GF cheesy garlic bread, which I have not eaten in years since developing my allergy. The stuffed mushrooms were ooey-gooey and delicious. The gluten-free crust with Da Greek was loaded with toppings and full of flavor. The warm coconut macaroons were absolutely delectable. Plenty of leftovers so you know it was filling and good portion sizes.   The only reason for 4 stars tonight was that the first couple drinks my wife ordered were out of stock. It was their opening weekend, so yes they were busy, but probably should have been better prepared. Nick was an outstanding server!",

While I planned on only having a slice, I found myself sharing almost an entire pizza and one and a half meatballs with my husband in one sitting. Oops.",

I don't live far from the restaurant and when I got home it was overcooked and dried out.  It was thin crust and parts of the pizza had almost no bottom crust at all.  I gave it another chance and ordered a large Sicilian crust with pepperoni.  This one was better, but not great.  I thought it tasted a lot like Pizza Hut.  This Spinato's pizza was $26 and you can get a large pizza at Pizza Hut for about $11 if you have a coupon.",

    "text": "So Hubby and I were there a week ago today and we loved it so much that we decided we'd go back 4 days later (this past Thursday). So to start when we arrived (both times), we were told that it would be either a 20 or 30 min wait. Let me tell you, they count minutes soooo quickly and I love it. The first visit the 30 minutes because 2 minutes and the second visit the 20 minutes became 4. So while our wait time doubled the first time, I'm not complaining about ANY pizza joint as good as this when my wait time is under 5 minutes! Our service was great both times. I forgot our male server name we had the first time. But he was great. And Taylor didn't let us down the second time. Our second visit, we were actually headed to another restaurant for a Pi Day (3/14) special. The line was out the door. Hubby suggested Spinatos again! I was quite shocked because we pride ourselves on not visiting restaurants frequently, at least not too close together, in an attempt to hit up all the amazing spots that we can in Phoenix. Welp when he suggested there was NO way I was rejecting! Hubby ordered the small meat lover (is that the correct name? Can't remember) and he was IN LOVE! He's a pizza aficionado and I'd say he's a pretty tough critic! But he was quick to say HAND THEM 5 stars. I ordered the small La Italiana both times and whewwwww although I was quite full about a few squares, I was like a square or two from being glutinous. I must say this is our new pizza joint. Thanks for great food and service! We appreciate you! And to the greeters at the front, keep counting minutes EXACTLY how you do!",

    "text": "A friend of mine insisted that we go to Spinatos for lunch. At first I was a little hesitant because I fear people's opinions of pizza, but I figured I trusted her taste buds so off we went.  This little place is hard to \"find\". Not because it's out of site, it's just within a bunch of industrial buildings on Smith Rd. The first time we accidentally drove by it. The numbers on the building are clearly marked, so I guess that's our fault for not  being more observant. We just expected a restaurant style building.  We walked in and my friend, my boyfriend and myself were seated promptly. We ordered our drinks and looked over the menu. Note that this particular Spinatos location does not serve beer or wine like a few others.   After reviewing the menu I settled on the feta, spinach and green  bell pepper DEEP dish pizza. I state this so boldly, because they do serve both deep dish, calzones and thin crust pizza (along with sandwiches/salads/and pasta). I'm definitely NOT a fan of \"cracker\" thin crust pizza, so this chewy delight was what I was after. My friend ordered the Spaghetti Calzone and the boyfriend went with a Sausage/Green Bell Pepper pizza. We were all very satisfied. It's #2 on my list of favorite pizza's in the valley. Nello's will always have the biggest piece of my heart.  Before hitting up this joint I read dozens of reviews trying to find out more about this sweet sauce everyone was talking about. I'm really picky about my sauces, so I almost went with a sandwich, but changed my mind in a \"what the heck\" moment. With me and sauce, I get grossed out at 'chucks' of 'stuff' in my sauce. I was presently surprised that this sauce is chunk free! No roaming grossness of slimy tomatoes. No soggy onions lurking around. If I had to explain it, it reminds me a lot of BBQ sauce. It is about the same consistency with that sweet but not too sweet under tone. My friend swears they put crack in it, and I couldn't agree more.  I will definitely be back to Spinatos in the near future. I've been thinking about it a lot since the last time we went.  I do want to say that it did take a while for our pizza to come out. Possibly next time I'll order out and pick up. But overall I'm a huge Spins fan.  ===UPDATE: 4/8/2014===  I still LOVE SPINATOS!",

One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.  On to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.",

Mentioning that I miss pizza at dinner yesterday, a new friend noted that Spinato's had gluten-free pizza! I was so happy to hear they added it to their menu.   Tonight for dinner, I ordered a 10\" gluten free pizza with pepperoni, feta cheese, and diced garlic for $12.90 (pick up). It was bigger than 10\" and was so delicious! Much better than the pathetic excuse for a pizza they serve at Streets of New York. I am definitely coming back here soon to order all the pizza I've missed out on these last few years.",

    "text": "Have you ever watched the turkey dinner scene in National Lampoons Christmas Vacation? I had to melt down every bite of that pizza with water before swallowing it. If I wasn't so hungry I would have thrown it away and gone out to eat...   It tasted like cardboard... I should have known it was bad pizza the second the guy I ordered it from said we're all out of 11\" pizzas. Right then and there was my clue that they don't even make their own dough. A pre-Made frozen pie shell is what they are using. I could have gone to the store and purchased a stuffed crust Freschetta and been a lot happier. Not to mention that the 7\" pizza with an order of 6 bread sticks cost me $18 bucks...  I've lived all over AZ for the last 12 years and have ordered pizza from all over the place... You want a good pie? Here are 6 quality places:  1. Veneiza's - NY style with Blue cheese and they have Buffalo wings. Want a good deal? Go in and get the 2 slices and a beverage for like 5 bucks... Want the biggest pizza you have ever seen? Order the Party Pie... Awesome! 2. Reno D's - Great Pies with a unique flavor. Wings have an awesome sauce so order a side and you'll get a 12oz container full. 3. Nellos - Offers great pie and a good price. 4. Pizzeria Bianco - Sit down joint. Make a reservation! Brick Oven, gourmet style... 5. Oreganos - Good pies including Chicago style. No delivery option though! 6. Gus's on Campus is a good \"I'm drunk and hungry\" place. Go Sober up!  Just stay the hell away from Spinato's because no one should have to eat crappy pie... Especially during football season!  AJ - Tempe, Az.",

    "text": "Four and a half stars!   While in AZ for work, I got a chance to try this place out. The location is small and in an office park type area, but from my experiences these places usually have the best food. I was NOT disappointed.   I was even a fan of the crushed style ice they use in their gigantic drinking cups - less need for refills. I ordered a dinner salad to start and it was definitely fresh! There's not much you can do to mess up a salad, and this place has large portion sizes. But this place is all about the pizza. I had the thin crust with mixed peppers and green olives - yes green olives - a True rarity to find in pizza joints where I'm from. Usually you're stuck with just the black olives.   The crust was perfect - not tortilla thin - so it actually held the toppings. They don't skimp on the toppings or cheese and the sauce is absolutely perfect.  Apparently they make their own sauce (lightly sweet) and at this particular spot they make it all and send out to the other locations.   Service was great. The greeter offered gluten-free menus before we were even seated, the server was patient and helpful and the manager stopped by every table towards the end of everyone's meals.   I'd give this 5 stars, but the only thing I learned that stole that 'half' star was that they use frozen peppers. I prefer just green peppers but the stash they use has red/green mixed as they come in a bag.   Truthfully it was an insignificant point due to the amazing flavor of their pizza and great service.   Highly recommended if you're ever in this area!  Since its not too far from the airport, if I'm ever in town for work again, I'm definitely getting back out to Spinatos!",

    "text": "The husband and I had a \"staycation\" at the Buttes resort for the weekend and spent our lazy Sunday day drinking by the pool.  After several or more margaritas....Needless to say, I felt a little hungover by 4pm...I was starving and had that weird hungover feeling in my stomach..Since he promised me pizza, I found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try (March 22nd).  I walked in seriously hangry and ready to eat; luckily we were seated right away.  We ordered the cheese garlic bread with marinara sauce and it was verrry good.  Crispy, cheesy, and the sauce was really good.  I could have ate the entire thing, but I had to share.  For the pizza we had the gluten free thin crust with pep and sausage.  it was EXCELLENT.  At first bite, I was thrown off by the sauce.  It has a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting.  The first few bites I didn't think the pizza was anything special...It was super hot, yet I was trying to scarf it down...(not a good look, but I was desperate)  And then, it happened.  After I finished my first piece, I realized I loved everything about this pizza.  I pretty much eat pizza any chance I get, good or bad. But this...This was some epic ish happening in my pizza world. The crust was perfect thin crust.  The sauce, hearty, with a hint of sweetness that tastes like it came from tomatoes that have roasted and roasted...and then roasted some more into perfect deep flavored marinara.  The sausage was zesty and italiany.  I've been craving it ever since...Unfortunately, we live a pretty good distance from this place, so it's not exactly close.  If it was I would be a regular.  Until next time Spinato's....",

    "text": "This place is absolutely fabulous, for many reasons.    First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to go (cheese and vegetarian).  Both were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.  The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a small pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.  Although the prices are higher than you would find at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.  Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a small food donation for a local charity, and he went above and beyond to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.  Overall, this place is definitely worth a stop (or two, or three)!",

I love how their salad dressings are all homemade and that they are very tentative on if you order gluten free to take out the croutons in the salad. Spinach special is one of my favorite as well as the Chicago and Nicole's!",

Spinato's has been bookmarked for a while so we headed over. This location is in an industrial area which we didn't quite expect but it was still easy to find. This location does not serve the full menu nor does it serve alcohol. We were expecting to have a beer or two with our pizza but it wasn't a huge deal. We made our way in with no wait. We ordered a large Get meat pizza on a Sicilian crust. The waitress told us the thin crust was most popular but my hubby insisted the thicker crust, and we shared an order of meatballs and garlic bread. The food came out quickly and was awesome. The meatballs were so tender and the sauce was to die for. The pizza was good too. A little thick for my taste but still very good. The next time we eat here we will try the thinner crust since that is what is they are know for. Overall we had a wonderful meal and would recommend them to all.",

I have to say I went in with my nose in the air. Usually, if I'm getting pizza I'll go to a make-it-yourself place, such as My Pie or Fired Pie. If I'm ordering pizza, I will order from Venezias which is a personal favorite of mine . Well, move over Venezias! This place has it all! I love the atmosphere here. It's tucked into an industrial strip mall in the furthest corner of a no-man's-land area. It's seriously a hole in the wall, but once you walk inside it's booming and bustling to life. The smells and the restaurant itself are amazing and the pizza is out of this world! I don't have much to say about the pizza, as it's pizza, but it's fantastic pizza and similarly priced as your major pizza chains. I highly suggest this place as it's cheap and better than most any other pizza you would find in the valley.",

The sauce is what really sets this place apart from other places I have tried. It has a distinct sweetness to it that was really subtle and enjoyable (I prefer spicier sauces usually). Topped the pizza with fresh basil and it really complemented the sauce well.   In the past I've always gotten the Mama Signature pizza, which is topped with spinach, garlic, and Roma tomatoes. I've had it many times before, but as my boyfriend pointed out, it does seem to get a little soggy.  This time around, went for a pepperoni & sausage, half topped with garlic and half topped with fresh basil. The garlic half was great, but the basil was definitely a better choice. It wasn't too greasy, and the sausage (hand torn chunks) was really good. The thin crust had a great flavor and held up until the very last piece.  They also give you little cups of red pepper and parmesan. The parmesan was surpringly fresh and flavorful. I don't normally bother with it.",

Spinato's has a unique crust mixed with a delicious sauce and fresh cheese. Can't wait to try other toppings. I had the pepperoni with fresh oregano. Price was very reasonable for the quality. I ate in and the service was good. Joint was clean too. Will be back soon!",

We had family visiting from out of town who wanted to experience some really good Phoenix pizza - we had been to the Scottsdale Spinato's, but not this one, and decided to try it. Between all of us, we got a medium \"Other Signature,\" personal Chicken Presto Pesto and medium Nicole's Favorite for pizzas, a family-sized Caesar salad, and an entree-sized strawberry gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect amount of food for seven people. My personal favorite was the Other Signature, but the pizzas were all really good. The Caesar and strawberry gorgonzola salads were pretty standard. The Caesar was an appetizer for all the pizza eaters in the group, but the strawberry gorgonzola salad was for my mother-in-law, and she wished she got pizza.  The service was kind of weird - our server left twice in the middle of taking our order, and didn't even ask one of us what he wanted. She also abandoned us and never came back after the initial ordering process. We had to grab other people when we needed water, and the bill was impossible to chase down.",

My friends had cheese pizza which was pretty good and I had the spaghetti Cal zone which was also pretty good.All in all it's a solid pizza spot.

In addition, the chicken tenders were the only item on the plate. No side dish. Just \"chicken tenders\".",

Decor is cool, staff friendly, and it's also way bigger inside and out with the new location!  The pizza... superb!!!! Absolutely loved all of them. The Margherita is probably my favorite. Drinks are well priced, too. I will be returning to this spot time and time again. My favorite pizza in the valley now. Must try!!",

Wife and I shared a lil Italiana and Greek pizza half and half  So tasty and my fiend told us about the option to order it extra crispy! Sooo good and crunchy and the toppings were just the right balance.  The veggies are a good flavor mix and combined with the olive oil and garlic for the sauce make for some great pizza. The spinach and feta and kalamatas with some pepperocinj taste so good together.  It's really the best out there. As far as the new location goes, apparently when you are this good, you can quadruple the size of the restaraunt and still have 40-50 minute waits. Oh well, it's worth it!!!",

I remember that I was not blown away by the pizza the first time I went but decided it was worth another shot. I walked out with the same sentiment. The thin crust pizza is fine for what it is but I'm not going to order it again. The meatball appetizer was fine but the meat didn't have much flavor and there was not a good proportion of cheese to sauce ratio, in my opinion. A few of the beers that were listed on the draught menu they no longer served, that was disappointing. The service however is excellent.",

But about a week ago I ordered my pizza and after paying 45 dollars for pizza and wings I notice the pizza was not cooks all the way, it was doughy. I put it in the oven in order to try to salvage the pizza but to no avail. It was still disgusting. I called Spinatos an hour later to tell them the situation and they had already closed. The delivery driver told me I was the last delivery for the night, so I guess the cooks really wanted to get home.   I call Spinato's the next day and I spoke to the manager to complain. All I wanted was a new pizza because I had paid for a quality pie!!!!! The manager told me she would \"investigate the situation and call me back\". Guess who didn't receive a phone call? Me!

I am a huge Grimaldi's fan, but decided to try this place just for a little change, but it just wasn't to my liking.....but that's not their fault, so I still give 5 stars for everything else.... salad I had was yummy, and my husband loved his meal and red velvet cake at the end of the meal... this place is going to just get more packed as time goes on with the new apartments going in, and all the other new buildings going up.....",

    "text": "Spinatos is my favorite pizza in the entire valley. It's a taste of home -- the kind of Chicago style pizza most people don't know about. When people think Chicago they think deep dish. But from Chicago to Saint Louis there's another contender: the cracker crust (think NY style pizza but not soggy, flimsy, or greasy). I would eat here every day if I could. Nearly every time my fiancee asks what I want for dinner I say \"Spinatos\" -- and more than half the time I'm serious. I've not had anything other than their pizza but why mess with perfection?!",

Tried happy hour appetizer menu of boneless chicken wings and trio of meatballs.  Although both where delicious , they should really reconsider the measly 4 peace portion of quarter sized wings.  Seriously nothing \"happy\" about that happy hour appetizer.  Ordered the super six pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  Very good pizzas.  Prices are relative. Large pizzas are big.  Fed 6 peeps with some to spare.  Happy hour food and cocktails available.  For dessert we tried salted caramel brownie and tiramisu and raspberry gelato.  All just meh. Nice for date night or family night.  Might have to try something other than pizza next time.  Will re-review at later time.",

Having never been here before, our group was ready for a beer.  Say what?!?!  No alcohol?!?!  What's pizza without a cold beer?  Anyway.    I started with the garlic bread sticks and the house salad with spinach.  Both were above average and delicious!  I was practically licking the bottom of the salad bowl and my husband definitely stole a 3rd bread stick.    On to the pizza.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to read the trusted Yelp reviews prior and was therefore surprised by the somewhat sweet sauce.  It was okay....but I'm not a fan.  The \"Lil\" Sicilian cheese pizza I got was the perfect size (I did have a salad and bread sticks prior thought!).    Service was good - no complaints.  I think they deliver - so maybe next time we're at Sleepy Dog brewery we can call them up and enjoy some pizza with our beer!",

Thanks to the lovely Sunny B.'s review on the Spinato's in Central Phoenix, I decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near Tempe. And that is when I found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from Tempe Marketplace.  I know we've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover, so seriously, do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside.  Chicago style thin crust pizza, oven baked to a perfect crisp. Heavy on the tomato sauce just like I like it, and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it. And they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky Celiac sufferers out there.  I am in love. I will certainly be back. After they get their liquor license, I might never leave.",

I never had sweet pizza sauce before trying Spinato's, but it's good, and theirs is very fresh.   What motivated me to write this review wasn't the pizza, though. Their calzone's are awesome! Especially the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone. That one only comes in one size, but it's perfect.   Like other's wrote, the building is kinda hidden. It's about a one block south of University, and the door faces north.   And I think Spinato's is still BYOB.",

    "text": "Took the kids there last night (10-21-10).  We enjoyed the food.  I had the \"Chicago\" pizza which had red and green bell peppers, onions, sausage.  It was very good.  I just now had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.    My daughter had the Spaghetti Calzone, and was not overwhelmed by the taste, really.  She picked at it, but said it was good - just not \"blow her socks off\" good.  There is all this talk by Yelp reviewers of the \"sweetness\" of the sauce at Spinatos, and they are correct - the sauce has a MILDLY sweet flavor.  It's not overwhelmingly sugary sweet at all.  After all the comments, I expected it to taste like tomato candy.  But it was just sorta sweet-ISH.  Some people talk about how \"sweet\" the sauce at Papa John's is, and I have never really noticed that sweetness.  Although I did notice the Spinatos sweetness, it did not negatively affect the taste of the pizza AT ALL.  The pizza was better for breakfast than it was for dinner last night.  :)  One other major plus:  The \"Italian Bread and Butter\" that is on the appetizer menu for $1.89 if worth every penny, and more.  Very fresh bread, baked daily by a local bakery, good hard brown crust, and plenty of cold tub butter to spread on it.  It was excellent.  All in all, Spinatos is indeed one of the best pizzas I have had in Phoenix - definitely in the Top Five.",

I love Chicago style pizza, but I also love any thin crust pizza, including NY style... basically I just love pizza, so I'm not biased in anyway.  I just think the sauce is very strange tasting!    I've heard the meatball sub is good, but I'm just not diggin' the tomato sauce.  The first piece may be OK, but the sauce and it's odd sweetness really loses me.",

But hey, the food is all that matters, and they have decent servers who try hard to take good care of you.  Prices are also very decent due to their location being in the middle of an entire office and warehouse building zone.  My old office was just next door and my mechanic is in the same complex.  They get busy at lunch time with a lot of pick up orders and walk in for lunch from the nearby businesses.

There was plenty of quality cheese on the pizza and the crust had a wonderful flavor, however the sauce was sweet. I am not a fan of sweet sauces so this was a deal breaker for me. Additionally, I also found the pizza a bit salty, however no more so than your typically pizza chains. The pizza was extremely affordable for the size and quality ingredients, so if you don't mind sweet sauce, this place may be for you.",

Our party got bigger than expected and none of us have been here so didn't realize it would be small according to Fred the manager when I called to RSVP. Much to my surprise it was very comfortable even for being small!  Fred was amazing to get my party of 18 in and seated quickly. Our server was extremely accommodating.  I loved the fact you could order personal portion sizes!  It was the perfect portion. My Greek salad was fantastic. The only thing not wonderful was the sauce was a tad on the sweet side for me. I like for of a tangy sauce but I will go back and try the marinara next time instead!  We will be back!!!!  Thank you Fred and staff!!!!",

The toppings are fresh, the crust is savory, and the best part - absolutely the best part - is the sauce.  It's fresh, sweet, and tangy - it's unlike any other sauce I've ever had.  This isn't cheep (it's not going to break the bank either), so if you're drunk and need a cheesy/greasy fix, hit up Little Caesars or Hungry Howies, but if you want some truly delicious and satisfying pizza, try Spinato's - you won't be sorry!",

There is no alcohol whatsoever served here so be advised, also the pizza did not taste as it normally does the 3 times I have been here. Also like all Spinatos they are closed on Monday. They have like 9 tables, a single picture on the wall... its really depressing. You'd figure the service would be a lot more personable because the server only had one other table, it wasn't. I saw the other server morw which made it awkward when it came to the tip because I didn't know who to tip. I expected a lot more.

    "text": "After reading all the glowing reviews of Spinato's Pizza in Tempe, my wife and I wanted to give it a try while we were visiting in the area. Unfortunately, our experience did not live up to others' experiences.   We ordered a medium combination pizza and disaster lurked before we got a bite in our mouths. The pizza was delivered on a rack that was resting precariously on a pizza tin. I could see right away that the ingredients had begun to ooze down onto the pizza tin. With a spatula we tried to remove a piece or two of the pizza for consumption. Bad move! The rack slipped off the pizza plate and we grabbed it just in time to keep it from hitting the floor. As you might imagine, we had to adjust our serving mode and finally got some pizza to our plates.  Let me cut right to the heart of the matter: this $25 pizza was just a notch better than a grocery store frozen pizza. The thin crust was almost transparent, and the sauce had virtually no taste. The cheese, I believe, was mozzarella which led to the pizza's general blandness. The Italian sausage and peppers, however, were fine. Unfortunately, the overall gustatory experience left much to be desired...definitely not an \"A Class\" pizza in any sense of the word.  Our server, Bryce, was full of food suggestions and he proved to an affable person. I just wish he did not include the word \"guys\" in every full or truncated sentence. I left him a generous tip and perhaps he'll invest in a thesaurus.",

I love the way they cut the pizza for you.  It wasn't the traditional big triangular slices.  They were cut into small squares, which made it so much easier to share, and to portion yourself.  The crust is thin, so it wasn't overwhelmingly doughy.  My sister ordered the same specialty pizza but gluten-free.  The crust wasn't as sweet, but still good for being gluten-free.  Definitely beats Picazzo's gluten-free crust in terms of taste.  I am addicted!",

    "text": "I think I have found my favorite pizza place. Woohoo, Yelpers. Spinato's is as good as it gets for me.  My date and I went here today (Thursday, 7/28) for a late lunch. This is the first pizza place that we have both loved. He is a lover of Chicago deep dish with a million toppings and I am much like Kenneth the Page from 30 Rock (my favorite pizza topping is plain).   Location: Spinato's is indeed tucked in an industrial park on Smith Street between University and Rio Salado, closer to the latter. You might not even notice the restaurant upon first glance. I didn't. (Look for the misters and the \"open\" sign.) It's not really a date-date place, so don't take a first date here.   Service: Greeted by a friendly, college-freshman-aged host and asked if we wanted the front or the back. I personally like being able to choose where I sit in a restaurant. It helps me avoid being suck by a loud table/upset babies/restrooms/etc. Our server Hannah was a sweet as could be. She didn't hover over our table and she came at always the right times to take our orders and see if we needed anything.   Drinks: As a fellow Yelper mentioned, Spinato's serves crushed ice, akin to the wonderful Sonic ice. I'm a sucker for crushed ice and would give Spinato's five stars for this reason alone. The drinks are huge. I didn't even finish my delicious Dr Pepper. Oh yeah, they serve Dr Pepper!!!!11!!!!!!11!!one!!!!!! and some Pepsi products, I think.   Food: We ordered a small house special -- Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach. The pizza was the perfect size for the two of us to split. The spinach was excellent and there was a ton of delicious fresh garlic on top of the pie. After reading other reviews that complained about a \"sweet sauce,\" I have to say that maybe the wonderful garlic counteracted the sweetness. I didn't notice the sauce being too sweet.   Dessert: We ordered the brownie bella piccola ($3.49), which was a great size to split. The brownies were not very dense, but had a great fudge-chocolaty flavor and the vanilla bean gelato was a nice addition to the chocolate overload.   Overall, Spinato's is a great pizza place and I will be back for more.",

This last time they delivered when i answered the door my dogs were going crazy and the delivery guy asked if he could give them a treat. I said sure and he pulled a dog treat out of his pocket. Excellent customer service and pizza that is second to one. I highly recommend spinatos!!!!",

    "text": "I would have written a 5-star review about Spinato's anyway, but after an experience this weekend, I had to Yelp about it ASAP....  I drove from Mesa just to pick up pizza for my family (yes, it's that good), and when I was getting in my car to leave, I was holding the pizza and the box caught the corner of my rear-view mirror.  The entire large pizza spilled in the front seat of my car, all over the console, gear shift, seat, floor, etc.  It was a mess!  I tried to clean it up, but I really needed soap and water, so I went in to ask for some napkins.  The manager, Tim, overheard me ask and asked what happened.  When I explained, he immediately got me wet towels to clean up the mess and made me a new pizza, free of additional charge!  He obviously didn't have to do that, as it was not Spinato's fault in any way.  Plus, the place was packed (as usual), but he bumped my pizza to the front of the line.  If I wasn't convinced before that Spinato's is the BEST-- not just for food taste but for customer service-- I would be sure of it now!  Things to get:  the Sicilian pizza.  It's thick and awesome.  Order jalapenos on top.  They are a nice balance to the sweet sauce.  Also, get the starter salad and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing-- it's tart and perfect.  Something unique:  the spaghetti-filled calzone.  Yep, you heard me-- carbs baked inside of carbs!  :)  The servers are great, the management is great, the location is great (easy parking and plenty of it, including street parking), and the food is SO WONDERFUL!  Try one of their multiple locations throughout the valley-- you won't be disappointed.  Tip:  they don't take lunch reservations, but if you get there earlier than your appointed time, they have no problem pulling together multiple tables for larger groups.",

    "text": "Spinato's is the best pizza in Tempe - no question. I've been stuffing my face with their yummy pizza for a few years now and I'm never disappointed.  Spinato's is a no frills, awesome food kinda place. You don't go here for the atmosphere, you go to fill your belly.  Here are a few of my fav menu items:  Normally I don't really care for cooked spinach but their signature spinach pizza is fantastic. It's loaded with spinach and garlic so not the best choice if you're on a date. I recommend adding sausage to it as well to kick it up a level. So good.  Speaking of spinach, last time I was there my friends and I got the spinach with extra sauce. I was hesitant because, like the cooked spinach, I don't like a ton of sauce on my pizza (apparently I'm picky). But just like the cooked spinach, Spinato's made extra pizza sauce extra awesome. They drizzle it on top of the cheese instead of just adding to the sauce underneath  to give the pizza an extra ounce of sweetness.   And then there is the best thing on the menu - the spaghetti calzone. It's  a full spaghetti dinner wrapped into a bundle of dough. Get it with the meatballs and the ricotta cheese. I mean if you're gonna order a spaghetti calzone, you gotta go all in right? Right.   The staff here is always really friendly. It's rare to get the same server more than once at places around here but at Spinato's their staff is consistent. And they remember us when we go in. It's nice to be acknowledged for being a regular. Kinda makes me think it might be time to visit them again...",

Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!",

    "text": "I wouldn't call this the best pizza ever, but it is very very good.  I've been hearing a bunch of buzz about this place so naturally I needed to give it a shot.  I'm not a big fan of the \"sweet\" sauce people on Yelp talk about but I'm down for anything.  My wife and I went for an early dinner Friday.  The location of this place is a bit different and we had trouble finding it.  It is in an office building type thing and it is pretty genius how they did it.  We had a little trouble finding it but the cars parked up and down the side of the road was a good indication that we were close.  It is a no-frills place but is actually pretty homey and not cold and stark as you think it would be.  We got there about 6ish and it was already pretty busy.  There were only 1 or 2 free tables.  We were seated promptly and the service was top-notch the entire time.  The pizza:  My wife and I split a small pizza.  It was half the Signature and half of the homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni (both thin crust).  It was more than enough for 2 people.  The crust is almost perfect, not overly sauced, and plentiful cheese and toppings.  It really is some great pizza.  But yeah, I'm not really a fan of the sweet sauce.  * Signature Fresh Spinach = pretty good.  I'm not really a fan of those toppings but I've heard rave review about the pie so I need to get it.  I'm not sure I would order it again but I'm glad I tried it.  * Homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni.  This was excellent pizza!  My wife thought it was a bit oily but its friggin pizza and that's how it should be.  The sausage and peperoni were both delish.  * Margherita = we ordered a lil one of these.  I thought it was very good but my wife loved loved loved it.  The crust was light and airy and the toppings/cheese weren't overkill.  * Mama's Antipasto Salad = eh..ok.  I wouldn't order it again.  Nothing special.  They need a Caesar on the menu.  Anyway, the place is great.  When I feel the need to get carbed out I will return.  I just have to remember to get there early because by 7ish there is a line out the door.  I also wouldn't mind doing delivery and/or their take-and-bake pizza.",

My dining partner had the spinach special pizza and the ingredients were fresh and delicious.

Positive attitude and great service all around.  This place has a good vibe.",

This is a very small place and were seated right next to the window with the light shining in our eyes. They were nice enough to pull the shades down.   We ordered the Family Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. Huge bowl and we had plenty for all four of us. Salad was crisp and lots of chicken. It was really good.   We ordered the thin crust Chicago Pizza which came with home made sausage and green and red pepper mix. Such a really good pizza. Sausage was really good and the peppers were really good. We gobbled it all up.   The service was really good. She was really quick with our drink orders and filled them up in a timely manner. She always asked about our meal and they exchanged our plates when we finished our salad. Always looking out for us. We left and my daughter left her keys on the table and they ran outside to make sure we didn't forget her keys. Very cool.   Good pizza, good salad, good service. Do you need anything else? I think not. So enjoy.",

My only complaint is the actual pizza. We got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard. The pizza sauce is also way too sweet. It tasted more like a dessert some bites. They put so much sauce on the pizza that you can't get around tasting the sweetness (underneath and on top of the actual toppings). Too sweet for me, but maybe you're into that? Decent price ($30 for three, all got sodas, medium pizza and app to share).  Overall I wouldn't go again, but would recommend to someone who likes sweet saucy pizza.",

Especially if you ask for the bottom extra-crispy. One thing unique about their pizza is their sauce. It's got some sweetness to it--nothing overpowering, just an undertone, but I think some people might not like it. Some other things to try are the meatball appetizer, the Greek salad, and the spaghetti calzone.   My issue here is that the Tempe location is really small with only a handful of tables. You can wait 2 hours on a Friday or Saturday night because there is no place to seat you. And no reservations. I suggest TAKE OUT OR DELIVERY ONLY.",

No one wants to eat rubbery mushrooms.  Other than that...it was really great. I had a thin crust veggie pizza, and (after picking off the mushrooms), it was probably the best veggie pizza I've had. The pizza sauce was delicious! I got the same veggie pizza in a thick crust- not nearly as good. Their thin crust has a light fluffy sweet taste, tastes like fresh dough. Their thick crust tastes like the buy them pre-made (this may not be the case, but that is what it tastes like).  Also, their \"personal\" pizza size is tiny. It was more like child size. When they brought out our personal pizzas, I almost started laughing. They are just so small.  So, Moral of the Spinato Story: Get THIN crust always, and not mushrooms. Everything else is soooooo good.",

The parking lot is not lit at night so it is extremely dark; would be nice if they had a take out parking space by the entrance. One night I came in to pick up a pizza and had a hard time pulling in as there were some guys at the lot entrance throwing a football around...they stared at me weird as I drove past them. Pizzas and calzones are good. Thought the side Caesar salad (take out) was pricey at $4. For takeout once in a while it's ok.",

They have a lot of gluten free options, although I have not tried any.  The Tempe location is small and gets busy during the typical lunch and dinner times, but it is worth the wait. Portions are large. Happy hour menu is everyday from 2pm to 6pm. Same great food from $3-$8. You can eat dinner from the happy hour menu and still have leftovers to take home. (Tempe location is closed on Mondays)  My family and I just ate at the Ahwatukee location on 1/3/15 to see if it was as good as the original Tempe location. The food and service was excellent. Bobby G. was our server and he treated us like family. He is really good with kids and gave excellent recommendations for combining appetizers. This location is much larger and serves alcohol.",

The quality of food is just as good as any location but they don't seem to care, what so ever, about customer satisfaction. I've asked them a few times now to customize my order and they always refuse. I could understand if I asked for something complex but it's only ever been small things. Like the last time I went, I asked for one of their sandwiches made with garlic bread. Pretending they don't have prepared garlic bread standing by, it's not hard to melt butter on bread and then sprinkle garlic on it! I e-mailed the manager to complain but he never responded, making it clear to me that customer satisfaction is just not important to them. Personally I'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business.",

Spinato's has incredible pizza, the ingredients and sauce were spot on and rich in flavor.  Also this place has crushed ice, which I just love!!    However, there were a few things that I didn't like about the place.  For one, it's tiny, meaning wait time will usually be a factor.  Once we finally were sat, it was at a really small table right in the middle of the room; I prefer a bit more of an intimate setting.  Our server was nice but not especially quick or observant; forgetting plates and silverware.  Our mixed iceberg/spinach salad was nothing to write home about; honestly it was the same quality as one of the salad bags you pick up in the grocery store.  The lettuce had a little bit of a earthy taste, almost like they didn't wash it before they served it.  This location does not serve wine or beer, which was a shame because I really would have loved a glass of red wine.  Lastly, we ended up with the cannoli for desert and I was not impressed at all; one bite was enough.    I was really taken back with the amazing pizza, but the establishment was not my taste.  From now on I'll be taking Spinato's to go.",

And, though I've lived all over since then, anytime I move somewhere finding good pizza becomes a necessity. I've been visiting Spinato's for awhile now and hadn't reviewed them yet. Why I don't know, I can only blame the food coma I'm usually in after my visits.  I should mention I've been to three locations and my experience has always been the same -  which is both rare and awesome.  If you're a fan of thin and crispy pizza, you must check them out. Their sauce is fantastic, and they've got great pizza down to a science. They will also brown your pizza a bit for you if you like your cheese that lovely golden brown color.  Their garlic cheese bread absolutely puts all others to shame. Get it, splurge, you're already eating pizza, so go all out. It is SO good. Note the capital SO.  Spinato's is definitely top 3 in the Valley for thin crust, check them out, they have several locations. You won't regret it.",

I thought that was kind of long considering the size of my order and how closely I'm located, but it is a Friday night, so I assumed they'd be busier than normal. Over an hour later, I still didn't have my pizza delivered. Called back and said the driver left 15 minutes ago so he should be there any minute. He didn't arrive for an additional 15 minutes after I hung up with the employee. When the driver finally did reach my house, I asked him how his night was going, and if it was really busy (which one could naturally infer given the total wait). To my surprise, he said, \"no, not really.\" Which makes me think that they just don't know how to properly monitor tickets and/or the driver didn't care about getting the food over in a timely manner. I'd be willing to try it again at the restaurant, but this wasn't a great first impression.",

Four of us were out celebrating a birthday, starting at a nearby Brewery and then planned to eat at Spinato's, as word is, it is delicious.   With our buzz on, we sit down at Spinato's and realize this particular location does not have a Liquor license.   This was a serious dilemma. We really wanted the pizza but we really weren't done celebrating yet!  Turns out, the Chandler location, DOES have a Liquor license...Hmmmm what to do??  Well, our lovely server made our decision for us and said go to the Chandler Spinato's, you guys need to keep having fun and celebrating. I just thought that was really cool of her because we were really mulling about it and she could just see the want in our eyes!  So, I think the customer service here is likely superb and based on that, I say GO!!! (Unless you want to drink, then go to Chandler)  See my review regarding the food on the Chandler Location.

Was kind of odd that the Hawaiian pizza didn't have any pineapples. And the margarita pizza wasn't anything like a margarita pizza. We were hungry so we ate half of it and threw the rest out. Pretty expensive, was around $50 for an appetizer and a large pizza.   I'd rather buy a $5 Little caesars pizza.  I would really like to try one of their pizzas that people claim to be excellent but don't want to pay for it again Since the first impression was pretty bad. Maybe it was just a rough night or something.",

The sauce was good, very cooked down and tasty but a bit salty. Too much corn flour on the bottom for me but my friend likes it that way so I will leave that for you.  It was good.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I heard that this place was amazing from some friends from school so we had to give it a try.   Our waiter was awesome. It didn't occur us that it was happy hour so our waiter let us know that it would be more food and cheaper  for us to order our own small pizzas then attempt to half and half a medium. We ordered a Greek and  pesto chicken pizza as well as artichoke crostini. The crostini came out really quick and was really good. I would describe it as a large crostini with a thick, creamy artichoke dip on top. I think the appetizer would have been better had the slice of bread been a lot smaller with more slices or presliced.   The pizza took a little longer to come out but that is expected with pizza and it was worth the wait! As soon as the pizzas hit the table, we were informed that our Greek pizza did not have onions because the kitchen forgot so we were given two options. They could either make us a whole new one for free and we can have the one on the table or they can cook onions and put it on there. I'm a poor grad student so I opted for the free pizza. Plus, it just wouldn't be the same with hot onions going onto my already cooling pizza. Normally, when I go to pizza places there's tons of sauce and barely any topping. Here there is light sauce and tons of toppings! The pizza is also cut into squares instead of the typical slices. This was nice since it made each slice easy to eat. Our waiter suggested we order our Greek pizza extra crispy (we ended up ordering both extra crispy) since there was spinach on top that could make the crust a little soggy. I felt like he took great pride in the quality of food that came out. For both pizzas, the toppings were fresh and the crusts were crispy. The pizzas flavors were well balanced and flowed really nicely. My boyfriend preferred the Greek and I preferred the pesto chicken, but over all both were delicious!!   For dessert, we had the cannoli. The pastry part was crisp and had a nice crunch to it. The cream inside was perfect! It was sweet but not too sweet and had chocolate shavings inside. I don't know if they make it in house or not but I hope so because the thought of that makes it so much better. Overall, great experience, great service, and most importantly great food!!",

First off, anyplace that cuts their pizzas in squares is already being compared with Little C and Oregano.   Secondly, when your sauce has absolutely no flavor to it at all!  Lastly, what's up with the tomato paste being decorative design on top?? Again, no flavor and no where in Italy would you find that happening.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is better than a NYC slice. Sauce is slightly sweet, ingredients are all very fresh. The gelato is really good and a fantastic end to the meal. It took awhile for our family of 5 to be seated at the dinner rush, but the misters and seating area kept us cooler than expected. The wait for food was as expected for home made pizza. Very cool simple intimate environment, great for a casual date or family time. Clean, easygoing, friendly waitstaff. Tucked away in an industrial area across from the Tempe Marketplace, it's worth the trip to avoid mall hassle gross food. Enjoy!",

I ended up only eating 1 slice of pizza, which wasn't bad but could've enjoyed it more if I didn't see the cricket.

    "text": "Follow me on the story. And please keep in mind this is True to the T with specific language used.   The night began with me and my fiance wanting to try the new Spinato's in Tempe. I realized that the wait would be long because the place was new and very popular.   We were greeted by the lady at the front.  Lady: \"how many\" Me: \"2\" Lady: \"it will be 45-am hour wait...may I have your number so we can text you when your table is ready\" Me:\"absolutely...my number is(480)123-4567\"  And the wait began.   45 minutes went by as we were patiently waiting at the front...then an hour came by...and no text message. So I observed 3 tables against the wall on the right that were open that sat 2 people. As I got up a party of two walked in, and the \"lady\" greeted them with the standard robotic greeting as we were.   Difference was that they were seated right away. I thought that was odd because we were sitting there for an HOUR. Then another couple came in, and again, was seated. Didn't say anything about receiving a text or anything...they were greeted and seated.   By now I was extremely frustrated to say the least and went up to the LADY and politely said \"how much longer is my wait...we have been here for an hour.\"  Lady:\"what was your name\" Me:\"Dani\"  Lady:\"I don't have you oh wait...FOR A PARTY OF 5???\" Me:\"no ma'am. Party of two just like the previous two couples that came in and was seated immediately\"  Lady: \"oh well here is your hostess..she will show you to your table outside\"  The hostess was also not very welcoming and when we went outside the table was not available. I noticed a table with four chairs and the bus sets were placing fresh dining ware on the table. I asked her if we could sit on that table and she said \"no sir it's not clean\".   Now why in the world would bussers place clean dining ware on a dirty table!!!! Hmmmm   Needless to say we were seated there and finally enjoyed the evening. Thank you BRYCE for not adding to the negative night that we began with.",

    "text": "**Vegetarian Friendly**  Great little Italian/pizza place for everyone! It's very easy to miss because of its location, so look for their van parked outside!  Appetizer: Artichoke Crostini If you love spinach and artichoke dip, you'll love this! Wish it were either smaller crostini pieces, or cut into strips to make sharing easier. Happy hour portion comes with 2 crostini, regular portion comes with 3.   Pizza: Chicken Presto Pizza (minus the chicken) and L'Italiana (Mamma's Award Winning Signature) Both pizzas were mouthwatering and scrumptious! I love that pizza is served on a cooling rack because it lets the hot air escape while letting the pizza develop a nice crisp. I recommend do not get the basil pesto drizzle on top as it made the pizza too pesto-y and oily for my taste, but overall still a delicious pizza. The L'Italian absolutely blew me away! The sauce was fresh and has a secret ingredient that I couldn't get enough of.   Dessert: Chocolate Chip Cookie I absolutely love that you can purchase just one cookie for $1. Perfect sized dessert too. Unfortunately my cookie wasn't as soft and gooey I was hoping for, I think mine was a tad over-baked.   They have tons of gluten free options; they even designate it with a symbol on their menu.   Great service. My waiter/host (Kyle and Spencer) were very attentive and gave a great family feel to the restaurant. Overall, I will definitely go back. I can't wait to have their calzone next time!",

We found this place via google randomly and decided to try it. My sister got the gluten free pizza crust with pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and red sauce. The pizza was so good that once she is back on dairy and gluten again she may still order this same pizza. I ordered their meatball sub with their house wine. You would not expect a strip mall Italian restaurant to be so good. However, we will definitely be back as the customer service was great as well.",

Tried the pizza and OMG reminded me of Home in New England Thin tasty and plenty of cheese.  A few days later ordered cand. bacon and pineapple at noon it got here not even 20 minutes later. Hot and super thin where you had to fold it to eat it and I was in heaven. Not sure what style pizza they call it but it reminds me of the Boston area pizzas Sweet sauce and loads of cheese made me home sick. They are now going to be my main pizza place of coarse it helps that they are located just half a mile from me and seem to deliver very fast.  Give them a shot if you like thin pizzas ala NYC and New England",

The waiter is A+ stars from start to finish.  Recommended good plates, maintained my water full, checked up on us from time to time, brought the tab in a timely manner without me trying to hunt him down.   Appetizer: Baked Artichoke Crostini, the bread is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. topped with delicious cheese and hearty artichoke cooked to perfection.  Main meal: L'Italiana is really  freak'n good. A nice thin crust with a very distinct sauce.   NO alcohol license so I went with water.  Everything looks mouthwatering, I can't wait to attack this place again.  I would recommend coming during their happy hour 2pm-6pm. The meals are at a discounted price.",

I wasn't a fan, but the BF really enjoyed it. I thought it was too bread -y. We also got some garlic bread with tomatoes, mozz, and basil.... This was super delicious! I could just eat this for a meal.... probably a really unhealthy meal that will leave me smelling of garlic for a few days..... but it's totally worth it.    So this location is a cute little hidden restaurant. The people are always friendly when I have gone to pick up, but I haven't eaten in the restaurant. I also really like that I can order online.... since I hate talking to people on the phone and all. So go Spinato's!",

It's a little sweeter pizza sauce, which is my preference. But the service was even better. Our waitress (Maria?) discussed the different pizzas and answered questions for us. After she'd put our order in she came back and made a suggestion for a change. She said, \"I gotta be honest. You ord'd good pizzas, but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't make a suggestion. What da ya think about switching pizza [x] with pizza [y]. I think you'll just be happier. If I was a havin ya over ta my house, dis is what I'd a make for you\". Her suggestion was perfect...she totally knew what she was talking about and we devoured both large pizzas. One fault was that the one person in our party who ordered a salad never received it, but she ended up eating pizza with us and never felt like it was necessary to mention it (other than to make sure we weren't charged). I will absolutely be back here and bringing friends.  3/30/16: Went back for lunch yesterday as a big group again. Same waitress served us and asked what we wanted. We told her to surprise us so she picked 3 large pizzas, each one with half of one and half of another. We devoured them and loved every selection. That girl knows how to please.",

I am not a fan of sweet pizza sauce so that was my first problem.  Secondly, it's very difficult to find and it took forever! I don't want to give this place a completely bad rep though because it is definitely for a certain \"pizza type.\"",

You'll have a stinky mouth all night because of the garlic, but it's worth it.  As far as the Tempe location goes, who cares that the drywall isn't finished, you'll never have a nicer group of people serving you!  Shout out to the originator, Joe in Chicago Heights, IL!",

We have been there 2 times, with an attempted 3rd time.  1st time, burnt pizza, was horrible.  2nd time, we were told that it would be a 15 minute wait, we waited 1 hour 15 minutes, then it took 1 hour and 20 minutes for them to bring us the wrong pizza.  Last time, we called and were told no wait, showed up 3 minutes later and found out there was an 1 and 1/2 hour wait.  They told us it was standard practice to tell any person that calls is there is no wait.  Won't go back.  Florencias, Nellos and Grimaldies all have better Pizza.",

They are fun to visit and everybody we have taken there returned in the same week. This is not similar to other pizza you may have tried. A little sweet is what some people tell me. Worth the visit and go hungry and get the salad. One salad will feed two and maybe three people.",

    "text": "I've had this place a few times and haven't been in for a while but I figure I'll throw my two cents in. This place is good for pizza if you're looking for something different. It's hidden away on a side street so it obviously has some followers or else it would probably have trouble staying in business. I've only eaten in a couple times and from what I remember the service was fine basically what you would expect from a little pizza place. The reason I give it three stars is because it doesn't draw me back. The pizza wasn't bad at all but maybe the sweet sauce thing just isn't for me. It is different though so it's easily worth a try and I honestly would probably be back every once in a while if only for a change of pace from standard pizza places except that I usually don't even think about it since as I said it is kind of hidden away. I actually probably should stop in again and when I do I'll make sure to throw an update on this review.",

    "text": "BEST PIZZA HANDS DOWN.  I moved here 12 years ago from Chicago. Just found Spinatos and it's the best I've tasted.  I drive 1/2 hr. to get this pizza.  The sauce is sweet and cheese is flavorful.  Similar to Aurilliios (if you're from Chicago you know Aurillios).  Worth the drive.  It's a little small location in an industrial type area.  You go for the food, not the decor. That's OK because the pizza is the absolute best around.  Just wish they would open a store in Gilbert area. They would put Rosati's and all those others (with the exception of Salerno's of Berwyn) out of business.  Finally a real pizza. Thank you Spinato's.  You have restored my faith in pizza in AZ.",

    "text": "Spinato's is a sweet, garlicy, gem hidden in an industrial park near Tempe Marketplace and apparently it's been surviving back there for a couple of decades. I am convinced that this is the best pizza in Tempe, perhaps the whole valley. Their pizzas are thin-crust and sliced in a grid, which means you end up eating about 10 little slices! Their homemade sauce is amazing and sweet and their toppings are fresh and come in an endless variety. Try the Grandma's if you like garlic and their spinach is always pretty tasty when paired with red peppers. The ambiance (if you can call it that) is pretty hilarious...very Long Island...think plastic flowers. If the main rooms fill up, they'll seat you in what definitely used to be a warehouse, still decked out with charming cinderblocks and all. It's also BYOB (my favorite!). They do have weird hours though. I think they close at 8 or 9pm, so give them a call first and get good directions.",

It reminds me of the pizza place that is generally regarded as the worst pizza joint in my hometown in Connecticut. That said, I live in Arizona now and it is one of the better pizzas out there. The two signature pies are my favorite, which is a silly thing to say because I don't even really like them, but I love pizza so I keep coming back. Man, life is complicated for pizza lovers in Arizona. Oh, and another annoying thing is that you can't get beer at the Tempe location.",
