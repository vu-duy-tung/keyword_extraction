Many people commented that it was bland or flavorless--works for me! Much better to taste the fish! Lots of wonderful memories of my dad picking up Fish and Chips on Friday--especially during Lent. My dad turns 97 on Saturday and I am picking up lunch tomorrow (Good Friday) and sharing it with my dad! The shrimp and sides are great too. It is a dive and we love it!",

It was flavorful & not too spicy. Decent portion that was full of shrimp.   Knock Kneed would not be first on my list for fish & chips but I'd go back for the non-fried",

The hush puppies and zucchini are simply the best. You gotta try this place. Don't let the location scare you. It's next to Christies and Juicy Lucy's but completely worth it. Only thing I wish they had was homemade tartar sauce. The affiliated Sullivan's pier that used to be offered it for $.25 per one and it was fantastic.",

This is not your place. And, you could probably tell this by the outside of the building. I wouldn't eat there when it's nighttime. It just doesn't look like a good neighborhood. The restaurant is clean and has some appropriate sea decor. The young girl who took our order was friendly and welcoming. My friend had one shrimp, one fish and chips. I had one shrimp, two fish and chips. Also, we shared six hush puppies and fried okra. The shrimp was like rubber. I would not order it again. The fish was good, but lacked flavor. I was impressed that it wasn't greasy. I would definitely get the hush puppies and fried okra again. The hush puppies were flavorful. And, the okra wasn't slimy and had a good taste. On the way out, I noticed a customer who had fish tacos. They looked really good. So, I might go back and try a few other menu items.",

What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)!  The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms.  Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about.  This meal was close to $30 dollars!   Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here!  My advice, skip this place if you can!",

The place looks fine, very clean and the condiment station is laid out well as others have posted.  The layout of tables is a little \"different\" feels like you on a boat or sub with narrow walkways, guess that adds to the experience.  Ordered the 2 fish (cod)/1 shrimp so that I could try both types of seafood.  The food came out looking great but as Shane S. said the fish looked like it was frozen too long and just kinda fell out of the breading.  It was dripping water as I cut into the piece and the breading was kinda like a shell around it not really infused into the fish filet.  So I was a little disappointed, the shrimp was good and would probably get more shrimp than fish next time.  Yeah, I'll probably go again when I'm craving this type of seafood, I'd give it another shot.  The cocktail sauce does have a nice kick to it as well.  I'd like to try the zucchini and hush puppies next time.",

There are a LOT of rules. I counted at least 4 signs that said you must have your ticket to pick up your food. Hey guys. if you need to put up numerous signs, maybe its your rules that are the problem - not the customers.  I ordered fish and shrimp with chips. The shrimp looks like long, skinny chicken fingers and the fish looked like a square chicken patty. Far too thin, in my opinion. Cod is a very, very large fish, so to get skinny (thin) pieces, you might as well order talapia.   The 'chips' were just ordinary frozen french fries.   No tartar sauce was included or offered. The self-serve dispenser had a sign to ask for it and when we asked for it, it took over 5 minutes to get it as our food was growing colder.  There is an exposed surge protector that the soda machines (Pepsi) are plugged into. I'd hate to think what happens if someone spills their drink near it.  The place just seemed very old and the staff acted like they are doing you a favor and won't offer any assistance on their own. They wait until you ask. If you don't ask, you don't get.  At almost $50 for dinner, it is not cheap and the food was very bland. The tartar sauce that they guarded so heavily, was disgusting.   Glad we tried it. Now we know.",

Patrons are 20-60 years olds from primarily the blue collar crowd.   Food: Obviously a 'fish and chips' place so most of everything is offered deep fried, including the vegetables. The deep fried cod, with deep fried okra and hush puppies were excellent. They also offer a few non fried choice like grill and baked fish fillets.  Service: You order in the front and then when your number is called you pick up. Pretty hard to mess that up but I would say everyone had a smile on and was helpful.  Overall: A great history'd restaurant that has been around forever and offers the unique ' fish and chips' experience.",

It seemed clean inside with a rustic fish shack feel. I ordered the 2 and 2 (fried fish--cod I think & shrimp). Shrimp was good but the fish (the meat itself) lacked flavor. The breading was fine and seasoning seemed fine. It's the fish itself just seems like it's been frozen too long or as if it has been soaking in water and just leached all of the flavor out of the flesh. I don't know how else to describe it. I'd say this place is definitely a step up from Pete's and I can't really think of any other \"fish and chips\" places around town that would compare other than Petes. I'm from the Seattle area originally so maybe my expectations are too high. I really wanted to love the food here but I feel if I came back I would only get the shrimp. Maybe they can look into another supplier for their cod. Pete's isn't even really fish and chips in my opinion because the fish they serve is essentially what you get in a frozen food aisle at the grocery store....processed chopped up and repacked into squares then breaded and fried. At least here at Knock Kneed the fish appears to be in a fillet form.",

I had fish and chips and Cole slaw since that's what I always ate there back In the day. It was as good as I remembered it. My wife had fish tacos, Cole slaw and onion rings. She's not a fried food lover, but she enjoyed it too. All in all the only thing I regret about stopping is that it's about 30 miles from where we live, so repeats will be few and far between.",

That is pretty dumb IMO, what if I don't like it? What if I start to resent the place because I by passed my always delicious jumbo shrimp? So, I skipped the fish taco and ordered my usual.  I like to get the ranch and louisana hot sauce and mix them together. Dipping heaven. They offer coctail sauce and tarter sauce as well. There is so many choices on what plate you can get, fish and jumbo shrimp combinations. Or just fish or just jumbo shrimp. The fried zuchinni is also good.  For the smallest combo it's about 8 bucks, drink is seperate. So it's not to bad in the price.",

My family and i visited the location yesterday and after providing my order the young lady took my debt card went to the back area and proceeded to talk with her friend for over 10 minutes. When she finally returned she laughed and said \" sorry I was taking care of something\". I took my empty cup and headed to the drink station where I realized all the drink were carbonated except for a pink lemonade that was out. I went back up and explained I had a medical condition and can't drink carbonated drinks. I asked if they would be filling the lemonade.  The one again blewxme off and said she would send someone.  We received our food about 10 minutes later and still nothing to drink. I went back up again and asked and again I was blown off as all the wirkers sat around at a table near the condiments laughing and joking. I finished my food walked back up and demanded a refund on my empty cup that cost me $2.50 i provided the one recipient I had left because the other recipient they took when i picked up my order at the counter.  Initially I was told i couldn't be given a refund because no one knew how to give a refund then i was told since I didn't have the second receipt that they took i couldn't get a refund!!! They began to argue with me and said they wouldn't be giving me a refund and would get someone from the back to put lemonade in the machine.  This was a horrible experience and I don't know how these people stay in business I will tell everyone I know about this experience!!",

    "text": "They say when you walk into fish place, if it smells like fish, that's a bad sign.  At Knock Kneed Lobster, when you walk in, you smell NOTHING, a very good sign indeed.  That's why they got a 3 instead of a 2.  Now, I know these reviews are supposed to be about the food, and that's a good thing, because the best thing I can say about the ambiance of this place is 1993 Thrift Store Rococo.  They say some of the best places are dives, and that's certainly True.  Just look at Mrs. White's.  This place is a dive, and it's merely okay.   So let's talk about the food.  I ordered batter fried zucchini, and a 2-fish and 2-jumbo shrimp platter, which came with fries.  Everything that was batter fried (zucchini, fish, and shrimp) tasted exactly the same, and bland.  It was not bad, it was merely tedious.  And it needed salt.  Points in their favor, it was definitely NOT greasy.  I think next time I'd order something that's not batter fried.   Between the Rococo decor and the food, it was a little surprising to be charged $12-$14 for the fish/shrimp dish, $4 for the zucchini and $2 for a medium drink (free refills) and to be served on disposable Coronet paper plates (the ones you can, if you're old enough to remember, pour an entire can of baked beans on and it won't spill).  Don't get me wrong; I totally understand the convenience of disposable plates, I eat off them at home, as often as not.  But when I'm spending more than $10 at your restaurant, a proper plate would be nice.  Will I go back?  Yes.  Often?  I don't think so.",

The only thing that is worse than something fishy tasting is something fishy and greasy.  I had the cod and fries and can tell you that neither of these came close to being that.  The cod was was light and fresh as were the fires.  You definitely get plenty to fill you up.  A seafood place I will go back to, WOW.  The only thing I regret was not getting wither the zucchini or mushrooms.  They certainly looked good as I saw them go by me.  An added advantage is Knock Kneed Lobster is very clean and inviting with plenty of parking.  I will go back.",

Brooks, the manager, was so helpful and did not hesitate to answer all our questions and provided great customer service. Our food was ready in an adequate amount of time and was hot out the oven. According to all, the food was good and all left satisfied. I ordered their fish tacos and had the chance to also try their fried shrimp, fried oyster, fried cod, chicken strips and their hush puppies. Super healthy I know.

Landed late Monday and this place came up nearby as a decent seafood restaurant so I thought why not. The sign says they have the best fish tacos in Phoenix and I have to agree. Food is prepared when you order so don't be in a rush but I believe it's well worth it. Fish is nice and hot, not over fried. Cod comes in nice sizes and it is filling. Tortillas are warm and the toppings fresh. I get the 3 taco plate. If your a fan of mango salsa splurge for a second helping for $0.25. Was good enough that I made a second visit on my way back to the airport....  Same order LOL.",

Customer says I can eat it in 20 minutes, nope sorry. Wow since when do you dictate where one eats.   3) 10 minutes before closing, over intercom an announcement, closing in 10 minutes. YEAH OK let me eat and choke on my shrimp so I can sue you....who does that? I'm surprised they didn't go to each table and tell everyone to leave.   I guess that's the new level of service they offer. F THAT...we drove over 35 miles for that. Sorry, your food is good but it's not that good. Back to Joe's Crab Shack....",

When you walk in it feels like you just stepped off a fishing boat into the dockside restaurant with \"Fish Shack\" Vs. Mexican Seaside type feeling. The place is very roomy with lots of seating, has a nice outdoor patio with smoking and non-smoking sides and a large parking lot.  Order at the counter window and be prepared for some golden battered goodness when they call your number. Get your condiments ready, take your ticket to the window once the magic number is called, and BAM! Flaky, moist, battered goodness is now yours to claim!  Everything was made at the time of order, not heat lamp fish sitting around getting stale. They boast \"The Best Fish Tacos in Town\" well I've heard one before and me being a sucker for a fish taco ;-) I took them up on the offer along with a 1pc Fish & Chips.  The verdict? I agree on the fish taco it was fantastic and piled high with all the fixings and aside of mango salsa. The 1pc you ask? Equally as good - you won't leave hungry even if you get the 1pc.  Stop by and check this place out, let me know and I'll come join you there! I still need to try the homemade Hush Puppies!!",

My first time there so I walk up and begin to place my order I then asked the woman to fry the zucchini a little extra not knowing that's how they cook their food. So she starts to push buttons and has a little attitude about it. Then I ask for the fish to be cooked well done, again she has an attitude about me requesting how I want my food cook. Mind you my first time and it only took three min so I wasn't holding up the line.   Part 2. Food was cool no flavor that just pops out at you but there's a nice variety you can chose from. Taste wise average.   Do I recommend no.",

The breading stayed ON the fish, which is a plus and the fish itself was nice and flaky without being too oily. The breading was a bit bland though, even after being doused in lemon juice and malt vinegar.  I tend to think $6 is a bit steep for one piece of fish and fries, but since I only had one piece of fish they seemed to just fill the rest of my plate with french fries. The fries weren't anything special, but they were good with malt vinegar and ranch dressing. Definitely a dive in a divey neighborhood, but overall a solid 3 stars.",

The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the \"hood\" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.    ---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.

I was told they fresh cut their fish filets everyday and the shrimp are a fairly good size. Very taste food. This place has probably the best tasting cocktail sauce I have ever had.

This is new for me, as the past 2.5 years I was stuck eating in the office.  Once you walk in, you place your order with one of two employees and wait for your number to be called. I ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and  was number 510. There was a bit of a wait, which is fine because the fish is fried fresh and served hades hot. The fries were standard, but the fish was fantastic. I found the batter to be light and crispy; the fish was flaky and moist. A cornucopia of dipping sauces awaits at KKL, but I stuck with the Lousianna Hot Sauce and malt vinegar. There's also ketchup, cocktail sauce, ranch and a few others.  We were fortunate to get there shortly after 11 a.m. before the crowd came in waves.  The nautical theme is kitchy and inviting in a way that reminded me of something that might fit into Sponge Bob's world. I'm looking forward to many future returns.",

    "text": "Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved. Once inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.  I ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland.   I do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, \"that works.\"  As a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.  DO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity.",

The menu is simple. You have your choice of various seafood, and an option for chicken for those that aren't seafood-inclined, with various fried sides such as fried zucchini, mushrooms, and fries. I opted to share a 3 piece fish and chips, and tried some fried okra and fried zucchini. The fish and chips had a perfectly crispy crust, with flaky tender fish. The fried okra and zucchini were delicious. The okra was not slimy at all, and the zucchini had a lovely tenderness to contrast with the crisp breading.  After ordering at the counter, you have a plethora of condiments to choose from, such as tartar sauce, vinegar, ketchup, and ranch. The soda fountain is self serve, and they offer good sugar free options such as diet Mountain Dew.  The neighborhood is questionable at best, but if you are in the area or if you want to catch a quick bite before a show at Celebrity Theater this is a good option.",

    "text": "When I first arrived i was excited that I found a diamond in the ruff. The exterior building was painted and decorated like an east coast fish restaurant. When i entered it was a bit confusing as to where we went in the maze.  Specials were listed in a hit board and a three fish taco special was running for $8.50 i felt like I needed to try multiply items to find my favorite so i ordered 1 fish taco and a 1 piece fish and jumbo shrimp. Again, my expectations were high for this business that has been in business for over 25 years. My order number was call and with great excitement i went to my table to partake in what i felt was going to be a great meal. I started with my fish taco that was advertised as AZ's best fish taco!? When i bit into the taco i was greatly disappointed that i got a taste of everything other than fish. After all it is a fish taco and it should be the star. I felt robbed, sad and greatly disappointed. Well there is still the shrimp and fish.  I choose the JUMBO shrimp next. Hardly jumbo by the way. I dipped it into the cocktail sauce and took my first bite.  What the heck is wrong with this place.  My bread ding is as thick as my not so jumbo shrimp. I mean it was ok but definitely not worthy. On to the fish. I looked at my fish and it was a good size piece of fish and pretty thick. Nice looking breading and texture. I put some tarter sauce on my fish and took a bite. Finally, i was delighted that my fish was moist, crunchy, flaky and yup, delicious.  I can say i would go back but based on the items i ordered i will stick with the fish.  Chips were not crunchy and just average but I'm not a big chip fan so i usually only eat a few so really i probably not one to give  feedback on them.  I did not post pictures of the food because i was too excited to dive in and EAT! So sorry, i forgot to",

The fish n chips is made is made from perfectly prepared meaty cod.  The fried,  zucchini and hush puppies are just perfect.  The back room is larger and can accommodate a small party, patio seating has been added along the Washinngton St light rail and is lit w fun party lights.  Shrimp cocktail and fish tacos are new to the menu and also good. My 96 yr old Grams loves fish and this is where we bring her to get her grub on.",

    "text": "For several weeks, I've been jonesing for fish and chips. Now, before everone floods me with suggestions, let me say that ive triedbover 25 different restaurants starting with fast food drive up to sit down restaurant. Even ordered fish and chips at Chase Field watching a Dbacks game!! They all have great choices, different flavors, and special combinations that make them unique.   But I'd forgotten about Knock Kneed Lobster.  Here's what makes this place special. If you want fried, this place is the king of grease. Hot, crispy, flavor fully batter fish and crunchy fries. Now comes the fun part. If you've never been here, come on a VERY empty stomach. Because ordering fish and chips begins with deciding HOW MANY FISH FILLETS YOU WANT!!  1 (wimp), 2 (you can do better), 3 (standard) 4 (now you're getting it) 5 ( nope. Im not sharing) 6 (Dayyammm!)   Hahaha I ordered 4 fish fillets, chips, fried clams, a dill pickle and ice tea. I finished. But i was hurting! Its. So. Good!  Knock Kneed Lobster is located minutes from sky harbor airport and south of the 202 freeway on 32nd street.  Give it a try. Nothing pretentious about this place. Just good, fried, tasty food.",

    "text": "Okay, it's been a month and I'm a big fan of second chances, so I went back.  Mostly good.  The stars must've been aligned because someone took my order this time!  It was late lunch hour on a Monday and there were plenty of customers sitting inside.  Glad to see it's consistently busy, if for no other reason than 'product turnover'... always a good thing at a seafood place.  ; ^}  Waited quite a while for my food, but again, in the interest of getting it hot and fresh, I'll be patient.  No problem.  Ordered a two-piece deep-fried cod meal that came with two sides.  It was HOT, so that's good.  The fish was fresh and tasted like a good piece of cod should taste: mild, slightly sweet and it chunked into firm, moist and fully cooked bites.  The coating was brown and crunchy.  Very mild coating, but I'd rather taste the fish than the breading anyway.  All good.  Sides were, well, just okay.  Hushpuppies were smallish and tasted of onion.  Not bad, but smaller than golf balls.   The coleslaw was plentiful, sweet and had plenty of dressing.  Again, not bad, but not spectacular either.    I might've given it a 4-star rating, but the staff was going through the motions, I think.  Again, not to be high maintenance, but how about a \"Hi.  What can I get for you?\" with a smile?   I don't know... maybe that's asking too much in 2019?  I'll be back, at least until I find a better spot with people who act if as they care, even if just a little.",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this establishment. First, the service from the cashier was awkward. She never smiled, was on a personal call, and when I told her it was my family's first experience at the restaurant she gave no response and did not guide us with the menu, location of a high chair, bathrooms, AND the condiments area. When I asked if we should seat ourselves she looked at me with bored eyes and responded like as if I'd been there before and should know what to do. I asked one question about a menu item and she gave me attitude like I was talking down to her. My question, \"the menu says this combo comes with one fish filet, what fish would that be? The trout, cod or catfish?\" This was a grown woman who had the attitude of a pre-teen who was forced to spend the summer working at her parents restaurant!!! She is not the best person to be interacting with customers.   Second, we sat a multiple tables. Where we initially sat ourselves the area in the room felt humid and slightly warm. Then as I explored the place to find a high chair there was a section that was cool, had moving air and much better lighting. We decided to sit there and when I touched the chair there was a sticky, gunky substance where I immediately felt like I needed to wash my hands. I tried to wipe the chair down with a baby wipe, but I think I needed Goo Gone. We should have left then, to be honest, though the establishment could be crappy, but I'm still gonna give the food a chance. That's gonna be the only thing to have me come back.   Lastly, when I received my food, which I had to get myself as the \"pre-teen\" shouted my number. (Yelp indicates there is \"No waiter service\") The dishes smelled so good! It looked ordinary, but smelled great! My tummy grumbled! I got all the condiments for my family to try. I've been so eager to try this place. Even with the mixed reviews, most from a while back. I just had to give it a shot, and have an opinion of my own. Once we took our first bite of our meal, we took more bites, and a few more. As we bit into our foods we kept expecting seafood flavor and smells. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. Mostly everything just tasted like store bought seafood. Just an ordinary fish filet (which since I paid about $20 for the plate, I feel like I should have been served the trout!), bland popcorn shrimp with cocktail sauce (more like salsa), and tiny breaded clam strips that were chewy and rubbery. The sides and jumbo shrimp though was pretty good! We ordered wild rice, hush puppies, and broccoli. Go here if you just want hush puppies.   I was so let down and disappointed with this whole experience. Maybe I was expecting too much? I love seafood, and have tried many other restaurants whether it's a dive or fancy. Any establishment from Pete's Fish and Chips to Papadaeux's is SO much better than this. I really didn't want that to be the case. I feel ripped off, offended and unsatisfied.",

I don't know what the deal is but to all 4 of us the food & service was great. The fish was fresh, not greasy, great taste. Shrimp was fresh & obviously not farm raised. Sides were great - some of the best okra I've had in Arizona. I saw some complaints about the food being bland -  um it's fried food and if it was highly seasoned there would be those complaining about that - you can't please everyone.   KKL has been around a long time & the are usually busy. There is something to be said for longevity in Phoenix in the restaurant biz - obviously they are doing something right .

I can tell the Catfish was not fresh because it looked dull, it wasn't moist, it wasn't flaky, and when I chewed it instantly turned into mush in my mouth. I'm pretty sure this fish was either expired or frozen. I'm very disappointed in this restaurant for serving me trash for 16.95. It wasn't worth it! Save your money and go somewhere else!!  The only thing I liked about the catfish was how crunchy the breading was but yet that was also bland. I also ordered the hush puppies which were the only thing good on my plate. The fries were dried out like they been sitting under a lamp all day.   By far this is the worst place I tried catfish and Hopefully I don't get sick. I won't be returning back to this place and wish this business the best of luck.   You guys want delicious catfish go to WTF and order MARYLN'S fish and chips. You wont be disappointed.  Well 5 hours later... No exaggeration this food made me sick and my stomach didn't agree with that nasty fish. I might have food poisoning. You've been warned. Thank god I only ate one piece of fish out of the three.",

They were mighty big. I almost regretted my order as it was just so much food! But I powered through and loved every single bite. I really enjoyed the breading. It wasn't too thick and didn't overpower the taste of the shrimp.  The fish was nice and crispy on the outside while remaining perfectly cooked on the inside (not overcooked and dry like you sometimes encounter at much crummier joints). The fries were nice and piping hot. Nothing special, but a perfect compliment to the fish and shrimp. An array of fine sauces are available for your dipping pleasure. Overall, just a great meal that fills you up and doesn't break the bank.   The decor is a bit dated, no doubt. It's your usual mix of cliche nautical paintings and furnishings. Definitely a hole-in-the-wall vibe. Don't let that discourage you, though. It's a glorious little dive (ocean joke!) that is full of charm.  Side note, Knock Kneed is super close to Sky Harbor International Airport, so if you are sending friends or family away for a while, stop here first and you will send them on their way full and happy!  Side note 2, why I even thought to compare this place to Long John Silver's in anyway is beyond me. This hunts, captures, kills, and mounts Long John Silver's on their bathroom wall. Yeah, that's right, the bathroom wall, not even the living room wall.",

Inside the building is a fun mish mash of tacky accessories and nautical theming.  I kind of loved it.    This is a really no nonsense type place with a pretty solid menu in terms of offerings.  Strangely enough, I saw no lobster on the menu until we left.  At that point I discovered a sign that advertised a new menu item, lobster!  Too bad I missed it.  Instead, I went with the shrimp platter which came with 4 jumbo shrimp that were cut in half and then fried in one long strip, and 2 sides.  I picked the hush puppies and fried mushrooms.  The mushrooms were pretty good, but could've used some more salt.  The hush puppies were absolutely killer!  I could eat a ton of those!  The shrimp I didn't really like at all.  Something happened to them during the cooking process that turned them all rubbery like clams.  I wasn't sure I was eating shrimp.    In any event, I really liked my side dishes and would like to give their clam chowder a try... and eat some more hush puppies.  Maybe if I am lucky I can come back on a cold day and get some chowdah!",

I usually get the shrimp platter with a side of fried okra and hush puppies.  If you like hush puppies this place has the best! I often just want to go there simply for the hush puppies.

The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.

    "text": "This place was awesome.  We live in the middle of the desert so it's pretty much a given that you aren't going to find a fish and chips place like you would on a coast.  I've tried a handful of places with the two places around the valley that have decent fish are Pete's and Long John Silvers (yes, I know this is sad).  I have just never found a place that is great.    I've driven by the place a decent number of times and it looks like an old worn out building.  If I was just going by external appearance, I would never try this place because it looks bad and it doesn't help that it's next to two strip clubs (with the one right next door looking very creepy and questionable as to it's legality).  The rest of the neighborhood isn't great but it really isn't that bad either.  I finally decided to give the place a try because I was craving some fish and chips and thought it might be good to try a new place.  The inside of the restaurant isn't much better than the outside.  It looks like an old worn out place you might find along the ocean in California.  I ordered a 3 piece fish and chips.  It took a while to get the order and the fish/fries came out steaming hot.  It was definitely freshly cooked.  The fish pieces were not evenly cut and tasted very fresh.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I do not think these are your standard frozen fish sticks.  Pete's fish looks much more like a standard frozen piece due to the uniform shape.  The fries were also very good.  I thought the meal was very delicious.  My favorite part about this place is the sauces.  They have all the necessary sauces available and you can get as much or as little as you need.  It was refreshing to get everything and not have to beg the person behind the counter for a larger quantity of anything.  The tartar sauce tasted good and is my favorite of all the valley fish places I've tried.  I've been back to this place twice since my first visit and have brought my co-workers.  They all shared similar feedback and enjoyed their meals.  On the return visits I added a piece of shrimp which was huge and delicious.  I tried the cocktail sauce with it and found that I really enjoyed their sauce.  I usually don't like cocktail sauce so it was a pleasant surprise.    This is definitely my favorite fish place in the valley and my co-workers and I have decided this will be a regular stop on our lunch rotation.",

What I did notice about the fish is that it doesn't taste super fishy.  Not sure if that's good or bad for you but for me it was great.  I'm not a person who really likes much seafood as I feel it's always too fishy for me.  I got a combo with two pieces of fish.  The breading was outstanding and the hush puppies were dynamite as well.  I'd probably go back just for the hush puppies.    The condiment bar is a nice touch as well.  You can get all the cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, hot sauce and malt vinegar you want.  Love it.  I got all those.  The cole slaw was pretty decent.  I'm 'A-OK' with this place but I'll probably have to make another visit before I up the star quotient.    Ambience,..?  Uh...it's alright.  I like the open window lighting.

    "text": "The Knock Kneed Lobster in Phoenix Arizona reminds me of that crazy uncle or aunt we all had when we were kids- you know the one who tried to be cool but just couldn't pull it off. You were mortified and totally embarrassed if your friends were around!  but you still looked forward to spending one on one time with them because underneath all that nerdiness and failed attempts at being cool- you know they had a heart of gold and you really loved them. That is how I feel about this place. You have to get past the plastic  seagulls hanging from the ceiling and the neon light in the shape of a shark dangling in a waterless fish tank. You have to overlook the ceramic mini lighthouses brought from the QVC channel and the clay starfish made in a sixth graders art class. If you close your eyes and concentrate on the smell of the food- you may forget you are in a Seafood restaurant in the middle of an industrial complex in a desert fifty feet from the train tracks- you might just hear waves crashing on the shore or the fog horn of an approaching fishing trawler. Alright- enough with the \"fluff\". This place has decent fish! It has a decent beer selection as well! Except for sipping on a $3.25 cold bottle of Bud- I felt like I used to when I was a kid and my Dad would take me to Howard Johnsons- squeezing a dozen lemon wedges over a half pound of golden fried clams eating malt vinegar fries with a tub of fresh coleslaw! All this for under $13! The fries were crisp and golden- I hate soggy brown fries! The coleslaw tasted like it was just made- the cabbage still had great crunch to it- I hate mushy Cole slaw! They have a great self service bar- different types of vinegar, fish sauces, and a whole tub of lemon wedges! I would have given them five stars- but being from the gulf coast of south Florida, I kept thinking I was in a Red Lobster wannna be where all the interior decorations were obtained from a garage sale in a retirement village! I do recommend!",

    "text": "Knock Kneed Lobster is a classic standby that offers damn decent fried fish n chips. It beats Pete's and Pirates by a mile (but god do I hate Pete's) and the fish is freshly breaded in the back, fried to order: not frozen hunks of prefab awful.  The breading is very crisp and the fish flakes apart and is quite tasty with a generous dose of salt and lemon. The fries are basic, run of the mill fries, but they do the job.  I used to love Sullivan's Pier in Mesa, which was the family's Mesa location, because they had this legendary coconut shrimp and tropical sauce. Sadly, both are missing at KKL, though their other offerings are good.  You're definitely at a dive; that's part of its charm, I suppose, but it is what it is. It's also just a buck or two more than you might expect to pay for a fish n chips lunch, but it tastes fresh and good and I'm alright with that.",

The fish itself was a little bland but I think that I will give them a try again but this time I will add a little lemon.

    "text": "Do I really have to give them even one star?   In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes: 1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that. 2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer. 3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the \"shrimp\"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the \"barrel of fried batter\" was left 4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen. Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.   It is an outrage as a \"restaurant\".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's. Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off.   and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation.",

This was not my experience today, July 7, 2016. The breading was hard and tasteless and reminded me of chewing through a shell to get to the walnut inside. And the place was grimy.

I would have to say one of the top seafood places in Arizona.   The reason I give 4 out of 5 is the dive aspect of it.. Seems like they picked any and every decoration their theme and threw it on a wall. Makes it look cheap & cluttered. And the bulletin board... At a restaurant? Weird.

    "text": "My family and I had just moved from the state with the cleanest air and the freshest fish.... ALASKA.   Thus, the reason we were ignorantly walking on Van Buren St. We had no idea it was a little sketchy. But what did we see? A restaurant that said Seafood? Let's go!  And we have never looked back. 8 years now, my family has been enjoying the consistently delicious fish and chips. We never go to any other fish place when KK gets it right every time.   Be adventurous and try it out! What's a little ghetto neighborhood?",

    "text": "Updated 5/2018  I've been a customer for over 20 years. With the exception of a couple of times, the meals have been really good. Generous portions, fish/breading combo has a good flavor and is crunchy. The fries are fine. The fried zucchini/ranch combo is delicious.  The fish was a bit thin in two of the ample-sized pieces, but one had a nice thick chunk of fish.   After staying a away for a while due to a clunker meal last year, this is once again the place I'll go out of my way to visit when I get a craving for fish'n'chips.",

    "text": "Pros: Best fish I have ever tasted. The cod is to die for. It is fresh, hot, juicy and the breading/battering gives it an amazing crunch that does not hide the flavor of the fish. Their cocktail sauce is incredible too. Cons: It is rather pricey and it isn't the most visually-appealing establishment (though in my experience it is always clean and well-maintained).  Overall: I have never had better fish and chips. Best fish and chips place in Phoenix hands down.",
