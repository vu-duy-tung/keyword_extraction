The hands down favorite was the almond/ chocolate almond croissants, the hint of what I assume to be lemon was amazing and made the flavor exceptional (so much so that for our next gathering we are doing double the amount of the almond croissants). The pistachio croissant was a bit disappointing as we hoped there would be more flavor there. It was still a good croissant though! Overall we will definitely be back!",

Temperature was perfect of all ingredients and a finely diced fresh house made salsa clinched it for me. Palate and nutritionally balanced brunch. Get on their email list for weekly 'specials'!",

    "text": "Essence Bakery Cafe is THE REAL DEAL. I have no better way to describe this cafe which has been one of my favorite places, if not my #1 favorite, for over six years. The quality is consistently amazing. You can taste the passion the chef, Eugenia, has for the highest level of delicious, casual cuisine. She studied in Paris and is truly a local treasure.   Read this article for more: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Fbella%2F2013%2F11%2Feugenia-theodosopoulos-essence-bakery-cafe-new-location.php&s=5610c8722fbcbd6108114be9f0e537b45f03ccdafbc32aeae7043257eabc80fa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">blogs.phoenixnewtimes.co...</a>.  Of course, the macarons....oh my goodness. I don't like caramel but I can't even keep the delicious caramel cream macarons out of my face. I seriously counted the days until they opened the Phoenix location and I haven't been disappointed. I've been the new location about seven times and have had good service every time.   The coffee is very dark, which I love. The decaf iced tea is delicious. The Local Power Ranch hamburger with arugula, balsamic mayonnaise and Dubliner Cheddar is very good. Get it with the greens if you want to taste the most delectable spinach and frisee salad simply dressed with a vinaigrette.   I don't even know where they get produce of the quality they do - the thick slice of tomato on the burger was so perfect - like the ones we used to eat 30 years ago that I thought were bred out of existence.  Every time someone comes into town to visit we take them here and they love it.  Even the decor is perfect. The modern, clean lines allow the diner to feel at ease and peaceful so that the experience revolves around the food - the simple but delicious tastes of real, quality food, perfectly paired.  FANTASTIQUE!",

The chicken was not\"lunch meat\", but was off a roasted chicken. But the best, dessert: coconut cream pie. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and left me pining for more! This will be my regular go to lunch place! Eugenia, the chef, has been a staple in Phoenix area for  her culinary talents. I believe she trained in Paris, and it shows. I like going up and ordering at the counter, it is quick and easy.I went a bit early, around 11,  and avoided some of the lunch rush.",

Still very flaky as evidenced by crumbs in my car. Not the greatest ever due to the style, but worthy of a treat every so often and the ones with powdered sugar looked even better.",

Love the salads, sandwiches and of course the macaron's are the bomb. We've also catered for corporate breakfasts and the food was superb. They have a small dining room as well, which looks like it would be really great for a group lunch or lunch meeting.   Really the only downside here is the limited parking.",

A caramel and a strawberry.  Both were excellent!  Needless to say, I needed a to go box, and I felt kinda off the rest of the day since that was a lot of rich food, but what the heck, it's Essence Bakery, you just have to go for it!",

After speaking to 2 different people come to find out they find phone orders too distracting. Why don't you try disconnecting your phone and locking the door?

I started with a cup of coffee. Super disappointed. It was warm not hot and it had that bad acidic tang to it. I tried putting almond milk in it and it broke apart, my pet peeve is coffee places not using barista almond or soy milk. Then the food came. I ordered the special. Squash blossom omelette with a ham steak. It was amazing! Eggs were perfectly done. Ham was delicious. They were able to carry to my annoying gluten and dairy diet restrictions. Unfortunately, the breakfast cost me almost $20. I may be back for the yummy food but will go elsewhere for coffee. I really wish they had outside seating up front or out back. Bummer to be living in the neighborhood and not be able to walk to breakfast with the dog.   ...went back to give it another chance. Spent $20 for egg breakfast special with bacon and a latte...for one person. Food is still yummy...coffee still tastes like dirt. What a shame. Won't be back.",

Breakfast is a dream, with choices of things such as French scrambled eggs with Dijon mustard and Parmesan cheese, homemade hot cereal with homemade yogurt, and brioche French toast.  Lunch is equally great with Greek and French inspired dishes and one of my favorites - homemade soup with toasted baguette.  The pain au chocolat is terrific - best I've had in Phoenix.  There are all sorts of other French pastries, some of which change based on the fresh fruit available.  The proprietors greet you as if you are dining at their house.

Which is not a bad thing, but we were hungry right then, so we left.  We were really excited when the Arcadia location opened up because it's a lot closer to us.  We've been to this location several times and we really do like the atmosphere that fits right in with the \"Arcadia style\".  You can walk in the front door or the back door and people will greet you with a friendly smile.  We've been in enough that the owner Eugenia knows us and always makes a point to say hello to us, which we love and appreciate.  And about the food... I've had 4 kinds of croissants and they are ALL DELICIOUS. The almond croissant and the almond chocolate croissant have a really unique flavor. And for those of you who like a more savory croissant, then the Gruyere is for you.  It's not covered in cheese, it's somehow folded in to the pastry.  Essence has other things as well such as Macarons and eclairs which are also very very good. In addition they have a nice breakfast and lunch menu. I highly recommend checking it out.  I know we'll be back again and again.",

Since Chef Eugenia and husband/partner Gilles opened a second location in the Arcadia district, we have been fortunate enough to visit fairly regularly....and the quality has never wavered. While the macarons have always gotten well-deserved attention, I always look for the people and service factor. The Chef has an infectious smile and laugh, and it brightens up the day when  you walk into the place. Of course, the food is as amazing as has been reviewed elsewhere. The chocolate croissants are indeed shut-the-front-door good. The coffee (something that is almost as important to me as the ambiance) is stellar and consistently good. We met GIlles the last time we visited, and it is easy to see how well suited they are together not only in the food they serve but in the caring they have for each other.  This is a delightful stop and a great addition to the take-a-deep-breath, read-the-paper, and relax-for-a-bit location list!",

    "text": "This experience at Essence in Arcadia was not what we thought it would be and we were very disappointed with our meals and the service. We are in town from Las Vegas for work and originally from Chicago. We went to Essance Bakery (Arcadia Location), because I saw this restaurant/bakery and the chef featured on the local news and I couldn't wait to go and try the napoleon with fruit that was featured as the special of the month, the brunch special, other pastries, the macaroons, and the strawberry rhubarb jam. We went for a late breakfast (almost lunch time), they were out of the featured dessert, which was disappointing, but it happens so I figured we would come back another day to one of the two locations to try the Napoleon and to pick up the other items. I ordered the brunch special, which comes with peppered bacon and I was asked how I wanted the bacon cooked and my fiance ordered the egg, bacon breakfast sandwich and an orange juice.  When our food was brought to the table there was no bacon, so I asked for my bacon. The server said \"okay\", but never brought it, so I just ate my pancakes. My fiances egg, bacon breakfast sandwich was cold and the egg part, cold, cold, but he ate it. We were so hungry and had already waited a while for our food. The restaurant was not very busy, the server was not busy, so why no bacon ever came and why the sandwich was cold we don't understand. At the end of meal we let another server know about the bacon and cold sandwich and for $30 this meal was not worth it and we were disappointed. The server brought out a manager and we were told we could get a coupon for a free meal next time, or free croissants, but with our experience and that we are going back home early next week, we are not so sure we would come back, free croissants don't fix anything, so we were told would get credit ($3) for the bacon and not too much of an apology, and no real explanation or anything. I advised please just let the owners know, so this can be corrected. To get our little $3 credit we would have to wait behind a line of customers, since only one register was open so we just left, since it's not worth the $3. I am sure the pastries are good and they look amazing. I have tried pastries all over the u.s. and Europe and was really looking forward to this visit and another one to pick up pastries before we go back home, but the food and service today ruined it. Maybe Essence should just stay with pastries and breads or hire better staff if cooking and serving what is to be fresh, good quality and bit pricey for the quantity food.",

Giles thanked me for my review, said the counter person was mistaken and should have taken the phone order, and promised to make sure counter personnel were properly informed in the future.  That is exactly the kind of response great management should have, so now I'm an even bigger fan.  He also offered some goodies to make up for not getting the pastry boxes on the special occasion.  That was very generous, but unnecessary (and far too late now!).  I'll be back regardless, although these days I'm trying to avoid gluten most of the time, so pastries are a rare treat now.

    "text": "As a big supporter of Local First AZ businesses, I will not be supporting this business. First, the guy who took our order was a bit frazzled and it was difficult to ask any questions. Then we ordered the hummus and bread w/cukes asking for more cukes than bread. Now, I've eaten hummus and cucumbers all over the Valley and this was truly pitiful. 3, yes I said 3 of the most thinly sliced cucumber slices I've ever seen. Not sure how I was supposed to eat a mound of hummus with those paper thin slices. I went up to ask for more cucumbers and they charged me $1. Well, I wanted to eat the hummus so I paid. 10 minutes later I'm still waiting for the $1 order of cucumbers. Nothing. I waited 5 more minutes thinking, maybe they're trying to slice them even thinner? Nope, they just didn't come, and going up to the counter wasn't really an option, no one there could do more than one thing at a time. SO, Essence Bakery Cafe, consider my dollar a donation and the last time I go there. It's so disappointing when the locally owned restaurants do it this way...luckily there are plenty more to check out, and plenty I've been to that got 5 stars!!",

Their baked goods looked amazing and apparently might have been a better choice.",

    "text": "I am so glad that I visited this restaurant in spite of several negative reviews.  Four of us went for lunch today.  We found only one parking space available in the rear which wasn't too bad because they have a rear entry door.  At 1215PM the place was quite full but tables were available.  On entry we were given menus to look at before we went to the Order Desk.  No line.  Several items were explained to us which was quite helpful.  There is a self-serve cold drink stand along side of the Order Desk which is normal in any place that does not take table orders.  Hot or specialty drinks are delivered to your table.  We ordered four different dishes and it took the kitchen about 10 minutes to prepare and bring them to our table.  Everything was fresh, warm and nicely presented.  I had the Grilled Mozzarella Cheese, Tomato & Basil Sandwich Focaccia bread with a side of Dijon Potatoes.  A fantastically delicious meal.  My wife ordered the Spanakopita with the Greek Village Salad on the side.  The other had Chicken Pot Pie and the fourth had the Pears& Blue Cheese Sammie Salad.  Each looked so good that we shared a bite with each other.  Everything was so tasteful that we vowed to order each others dish on our return.  Efficient, friendly and delicious.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.  Some might think it a bit pricey (I didn't) but if you do, it's one heck of a trade-off for the quality you get.  A great breakfast place and even a better luncheon place.  Yes, we all departed with our quota of freshly baked goodies!",

    "text": "RUDE, in all CAPS! When I arrived, the cashier was having difficulty figuring out how to work the register for the guy in front of me. I gave her the \"don't worry about it\" smile as running a register would be the last job I would want on this earth and I didn't want her to feel  anymore anxious than she already was, because the next customer (me) was getting ticked because of the wait. She figured it out, and a new girl stepped in to take her place and I ordered my eggs. The girl says, \"sorry, breakfast is over.\" Well, it still felt like breakfast time to me and I asked her \"what's your cut off time\" and she says, 10:30. I look at my i phone and it says, exactly, 10:31. Keeping in mind, I arrived at 10:20 and  was having a serious egg craving, I  ask, NICELY, \"could you ask them if they could make one more scrambled egg order (nothing fancy here) and an older woman, also behind the counter, jumps in, glares at me and says, NO! I have eaten here before, the food was excellent, HOWEVER, coming from a long line of successful entrepreneurs, I have this to say. Whoever owns this restaurant, may I suggest at your next morning meeting, that you instruct your employees on the basics of how to treat your customer, you know, the ones whom your business depends upon to stay up and running. I went down a few blocks to La Grande L'Orange, yes, it was packed and the parking was challenging but it was worth the hassle. The eggs were perfect, the employees, pleasant and friendly. The staff at Essence should make a field trip over there, with their \"How To\" notebook in hand, your TIP from this ex-customer.",

I'm glad they have opened another location with more room, closer to my neck of the woods, so I  met up with a buddy for brunch .  I like the space a LOT...it's laid out nicely but would benefit from some sound dampening.  I ordered the special...quinoa & root veggie hash, eggs, and a spinach & greyere croissant and it was yummy.  The coffee was fabulous as well!    My buddy had the breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it as well.  All in all, this was an enjoyable meal.  So, how do they get more stars???  Pacing.....my friend got brekkie a good 7 minutes before I did.  I don't necessarily mind a wait but bringing the food together makes things less awkward.  The table beside us had a longer time gap than we did, so there is room for improvement.  All in all, things went well; making that small change will get loyal, repeat customers!",

Since I don't really understand the draw of the macaron, I stuck to the regular pastry case. Tried the fruit tart, a chocolate eclair, a sort of caramel chocolate tart, and a slice of mille-feuille (Napoleon) along with a small iced coffee to go.  All of the pastries seemed pretty fresh and were very well made. I wasn't too impressed with the flavour, though. Something that should have been quite decadent was sub-par. I wish I had gone with some of the warm pastry breads instead. They also have breakfast and lunch, but we were here just for dessert. None of the drinks are listed on the menu which was odd. They also only had soy or skim milk on the bar for my coffee.  The interior is very austere and modern with a really cool vintage power mixer in the corner, apparently the owner's own, but didn't seem very warm or inviting as I expect a bakery to be. This is a neighborhood in east Phoenix, not Manhattan.  Overall, a very meh experience. Usually a new business needs the wiggle room to grow into their own feet, but since Essence is already well established in their other location in Tempe, I have to just assume I'm not the target clientele and my experience is quite different from the regulars'.",

Since this could actually be dangerous if swallowed, I felt like I should let the manager know.  I made it clear that the food was great but that I thought they should be aware of the bone problem.  The manager just shrugged and said, \"We cook our own chickens and sometimes that happens.\"  This response was wrong in so many ways.  No \"I'm sorry,\" \"We\"ll check into it so it doesn't happen again,\" or even a \"Let us buy you a cookie.\"  Just a shrug and an excuse.

My egg sandwich was on a fresh brioche made at the restaurant.  The potatoes on the big breakfast wasn't the usual fried hashbrowns, but a potato galette with a crisp exterior.   Our order was more than enough for the two of us (we ended up getting a chocolate croissant to split).

    "text": "Met a friend there for some breakfast. I'm not usually a big fan of bakery type places but this was excellent. You order at the counter. The decor is modern and minimalist. A very nice environment. I had \"The Big Breakfast.\" 2 eggs, mashed potato cake, sausage, mushrooms, and a baguette. Everything was perfect. The eggs were cooked perfectly(over medium), the sausage tasty, the potatoes were well made and finally the mushrooms were perfectly sauteed. I like things simple and well made. Each item was perfectly prepared and they all complimented each other nicely. Finally their Nicaraguan Organic coffee is smooth and strong. No hints of corporate coffee here. Seriously good breakfast. I can't wait to head back and try something else.",

A TRULY great croissant. And here at Essence? I think I have to say top croissant ever. ALSO, the macarons. I've always sort of detested macarons in general. They always seem like dry puffs of air. Well, I tried a few of their large size macarons and I think I finally understand what a macaron is supposed to taste like. The raspberry rose on tastes like silky sweet flowers, and the lemon one was SO delightful.  We went there once more on our way out of town, & got breakfast and pastries to go. I also have to vouche for their french scrambled eggs, and potato cake. They just do everything here so well, there is not words.... Thank you Essence Bakery. I Love you!",

Something that more local businesses should do in the Valley. I can only think of two other places where ownership goes out of their way to welcome customers. The sausage turnover and croissants are amazing!",

I've never in my life had a refusal to cut a sandwich in half.  The server was fabulous however, very personable and helpful.  Love the food, but was really unpleasantly surprised at the chef's attitude.  I hope she is just having a bad morning and is a more generous and accommodating professional ordinarily.",

Today I got the Chicken Club on a croissant with potato salad. I have dreams about this sandwich...add avocado if you want to raise the yum factor! The potato salad is okay, it's heavy on the mustard seeds which isn't my favorite.   The desserts and croissants are always fresh and the selection is always different, so we always try different things. I stuck with macaroons today, which I've tried before and they are always fantastic.",

I know if I don't have the right amount of sugar and chocolate, then the chocolate taste will be cancelled out. I might as well go to the store to pickup $3.95 brown sugar and eat it. Also I called ahead to reserve a small seasonal pie (and they really didn't care, it's like I never called), and it didn't get reserved but they just so happened to have the last one available. I'll just make the worthwhile trip to the Tempe location.",

The french pastries on display looked fab, but we went with the more traditional 'hot breakfast' menu - specifically the Egg Sandwich and Huevos Frenchos.   While the food wasn't bad, it was overwelmingly buttery [and heavy with a half an avocado on each dish] and just not what we were looking for or really expecting. A pet peeve of ours, hubby and I both experienced 'staight out of the fridge' condiments and salsa which were served with hot eggs and barely warm potatoes. Service was slow and coffee only ok...I am sure the Bakery offerings are what really helps make this a popular morning 'destination'.  WIth so many other strong breakfast choices within a mile, The Henry, La Grande, Matts Breakfast Place, Chestnut etc, it is unlikely we will be back. :(",

    "text": "Managed to pop in a couple minutes before they closed and didn't get any attitude from the cashier, which was appreciated.  That said, 3pm is an awfully early closing time.  I bought a large mint chocolate macaron ($3.42 after tax before tip).  It had a lovely moist texture inside.  The outer creme center was crusted with solid chocolate chips but I feel like a chocolate dip/shell/coat on the bottom half would have made for a better flavor.  My complaint is that it didn't really taste like mint.  The dominant flavors were vanilla and chocolate.  The very dark green dyed color has me wondering how much food coloring they use, and if it's natural or not.  Still, the gooey center was fantastic.  The pricing here is quite high, though the quality seems good.  I probably won't be back often as it's not very convenient for me compared to bakeries like Urban Cookies or AJ's/Whole Foods, and the fact that I really don't like driving down Indian School Road (the traffic situation on the street with so many street lights is awful, the right lane of the two lane side of the road is always stopping due to heavy pedestrian traffic and people pulling into the businesses that don't have turn lanes).  They're also closing the bakery for two weeks of the summer.  I do appreciate the bakery not imposing a minimum or fee on credit card purchases, as that's a major pet peeve of mine that has me avoid places.  Overall, my mint chocolate macaron wasn't minty, so I cannot give more than 3 stars.  It was a delightful dessert, but it was not what was promised.",

The baguettes are crispy and tasty, just like in France, and their croissants and pains au chocolat, too. I especially like that they have two bars of chocolate in the pains au chocolat (it's basically a double pain au chocolat). You do have to be careful to time your visit, as sometimes they have not yet finished baking the bread, and there's no set time when you know for certain it will be done every morning (I'm talking about showing up around opening times fyi). Anyways, we always make a point to stop here and get these pastries for breakfast when we're in town. And the brioche is delicious, too! The owners are very friendly and great to talk with. Highly recommend. This is the best place for viennoiseries we've found, and we've been test tasting a bunch of places in LA, too! If only Essence were (also) in LA...we're still on the hunt for a place on par with their viennoiseries.",

Brushed that empty feeling aside and proceeded to check my Facebook feed (because that's what a normal millennial does every morning!). And then I saw my friend's post who's currently in Paris enjoying her Parisian croissant.   That crushed me. That was one of those moments where social scientists say that Facebook can't be good for you. Staring at my lonesome espresso, I was really upset.   So, whatevs, let me check my gmail.... Ooh KJZZ March offers! And just like an answered prayer, there it was -- a 10% discount for a bakery called Essence Bakery. I read the short description, checked Yelp, and BAM! We have a winner.   Checked myself in the mirror, drove myself to the bakery and ordered every single croissant and the pecan sticky bun. Mmmmm. Just the right amount of \"fluffiness\", soft and tender in your mouth!   Took my order home and brewed another round of espresso... I have to say, my espresso looked like a high roller rap star flanked by all these beautiful and delicious croissants! You go, bruh!  From now on, as long as I live in this state, this will be my bakery and my source for all pastries!",

They took the sandwich back to fix their mistake but the server with the blonde bobbed hair and thick black glasses told us it would be a long wait for the fruit because she couldn't just ring up a side of fruit and they were very busy.

We absolutely love their croissants (although they used to be bigger) and baguette, the chocolate truffle cookie is amazing!  And if they make it correctly the house made vanilla iced latte is delicious.  They try to use local and organic ingredients which I personally appreciate.  So my complaint about this place is the drinks are not always consistent, the last latte I got was way to sweet that I did not even want to drink it, but when it's made right it's absolutely delicious.  Also a big compliant I have is twice I have gone in and the espresso machine is closed down early. I went in yesterday to get a latte at 2:15 and the machine was already shut down for the day.  The turn over here is horrible so it's always a new employee at the counter and I think that's why the consistency here is always just a little off.  Any other place I would not put up with all this but for some reason I keep coming back. I just wish they could act a little bit more put together.",

I didn't partake in any macaroons or pastry this time but my coworker had to wipe drool off of my face while we were waiting in line to order. I will be back to swoop some sweet delights very soon.   I ordered the Mediterranean platter which included dolmades (which I thought were a teense too oily), hummus (nice texture, not overly whipped, still had a slight chunk which I enjoyed), a lovely chopped Greek salad, and heavenly toasted and lightly buttered Baguette. It was very good -- great portion size and no overwhelming feta flavors which can be my main complaint with Mediterranean/Greek food. I wanted a bit more garlic in each offering but overall great dish , I didn't leave any on my plate.   Now let's talk bread -- I'm thinking the next time I come back, I'm ordering the 18 inch baguette sliced in half, toasted and buttered. Not even kidding. I love bread and this bread made my inner fat kid squeal with delight.   My coworkers ordered the mini grilled cheese & pear salad, the caprese sandwich, a quiche, and some sort of veggie salad. Everyone was very satisfied with their entree selections and I'm game planning my next visit.",

Just spent $55 on breakfast and terrible service. Had some coffee, the breakfast turnover, French toast, egg sandwich and huevos frenchos. Asked for a simple substitution of an equally priced side to accommodate my wife's diet but they only agreed to substitute with a slice of tomatoe. I wouldn't have minded just buying an extra side; it was the way they handled it. Like I was being a bother to even ask for it. The entire behavior of the manager was a great example of what not to do in a customer service environment. We actually had the waitress apologize for the manager.",

    "text": "Oh, Honey, the macarons at Essence Bakery are legendary. Seriously, I read about them for the 1st time in Departures Magazine and thought, \"World renowned French pastries in Phoenix?\" Who knew? They were located in Tempe at the time, so I wasn't going to make a trip out there except maybe for a special occasion, so I forgot all about Essence until I read they had moved to Arcadia. I finally went for breakfast and had the most divine scrambled eggs with chives and goat cheese and a great side salad! The salad dressing was simple, flavorful and so vinaigrette Francais! The meal came with fresh baked toast and homemade jam. Essence's coffee items are de-lovely. The mini quiches are creamy and dreamy. I am a stickler for pie crust and the ones on these quiches are perfection. Their Meyer Lemon croissants and caramel brioche will dazzle any brunch company you might need to impress......but my heart belongs to the Essence Bakery caramel creme macaron. I can feel my waistband getting tighter just thinking about it. Give this place your love, they'll give you theirs!",

One of my sayings when in France is \"every next pasteria on the right!\"  Well, this is one that I would keep circling back to.  The pastries, the croissants, the macaroons!! They are so light and delicate.  The breakfasts are simply perfect.  A Great casual place, and each time I go, I close my eyes and picture myself sitting at an outdoor table somewhere in France.  It is just too good if there is such a thing.  The chef/baker is nothing less than amazing. Merci pour la nourriture fabuleuse!",

The menu is suited for the epicurean, but has also more basic items with gourmet twists (like the \"big breakfast\" that comes with mashed potato cake and sauteed mushrooms). There is a full selection of coffee and espresso drinks. The coffee comes in warm (!) cups! I had the granola with dates and yogurt, and fell in love with the granola. There are plenty of vegetarian options, and an added bonus is that many of the ingredients are sourced locally.   Finally, the chef/ owner was behind the counter greeting customers and taking orders. The service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was comfortable (sort of industrial kitchen with some cute touches and big windows). I will definitely be back, and hope to try some pastries next time!",

All of the people working there seemed to have no idea of what was going on around them.  At a breakfast place, I wouldn't expect there to be a shortage of coffee for more than 15 minutes.. That happened. I originally ordered the special and while I was ordering they took the special off the wall.  I pointed out to the girl taking my order that she should check if they still have it.  She said they had to make the sauce and that it would be a \"little bit\".  I then asked her roughly how long time wise that would be and she came back and said \"they said it will be a little bit\".  Then I ordered the quiche Lorraine, it took forever to be delivered and when it got to the table it was so cold like it had been sitting in the fridge.  If you prepare your food and put it in the cooler, and then heat it for about 30 seconds, I'd imagine it wouldn't take 30 minutes to prepare.  I couldn't help but notice the special which was supposedly unavailable for \"a little bit\" being delivered to several groups of people who ordered shortly after me and still received there food before me.  If you eat here, your experience will be dismal and probably frustrating. I gave this review 1 star because the baguette was delicious, but if you want a teaspoon of self proclaimed \"homemade\" jam which is probably from Costco, you'll have to pay for it.  This is the first review I have ever written but it needed to be done.  Spend your money elsewhere.",

Unfortunately those alone aren't enough to merit a return visit from me or my friends. Where Essence falls short, and REALLY fell short today, is in the quality of service. I witnessed and absolute lack of communication and connection between the front of house staff. There were two males and one female, all of which failed to comminate with one another. Only one of them (the tall guy with the dark hair) had something that even remotely resembled a smile on their face or willingness to be helpful. One my beverages was made incorrectly and the other nearly wasn't made at all, until they finally realized they had forgotten about us. What I see here is a serious LACK OF TRAINING. Your FOH employees are the first impression when someone walks through the door and the last impression when someone leaves! If you want repeat business, training is key. Even with all the mistakes, proper customer service may have improved the experience. However, my girlfriends and I left unimpressed.",

    "text": "Ehhh... Sorry Essence, but you dropped the ball.  We ordered a small OJ, 1 coffee, Huevos Frenchos, and a  Brunch Special (chocolate waffle w/ toasted hazelnuts and homemade creme). Total, $27. The eggs in the Huevos Frenchos were very softly scramled, and came with a small side of fingerling potatoes. I appreciate how delicately the chef handled making the eggs, they were clearly attended to! Although, they came out very cold which ruined it. The waffle had too much fudge, but were overall decent. The waffle itself was light and airy.  Pros: - Aesthetically very clean and attractive - Menu is creative and unique - Service is friendly - Good food presentation  Cons: - Overpriced ($3.50 for 4 oz of Orange Juice) Folks, you can get away with these prices if the issues below didnt exist. - Portions are small - Food was cold - Food is just average, nothing to write home about (Or rave on Yelp about) - Slow Service. Took 10 minutes to get drinks, and over 30 minutes for food, and it was not overly busy. Yes, I did time it!  Final thought...I will not go back. I recomend trying it for yourself, but personally i will not pay those prices again at the risk of being highly unsatisfied. I think the chef has a good idea of what they're trying to accomplish, but they failed at execution. Hope you guys work out the kinks and succeed in the future! Maybe hire a good kitchen manager?",

    "text": "We were really excited to try this place after seeing it on AZ Highways. My wife loved the chocolate croissants that she had in Paris and this place is suppose to be just as good. When we went to order our food on the afternoon of March 20, 2015 the guy working behind the counter took a phone order after he just helped an elderly couple. Then he took another phone call, so I got in the other line that had two other people in it. Within a minute or two he came to the counter and helped the people in front of me. I placed my order and the girl behind the counter helping me seemed not to happy to be there.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and my wife had the Jalapeno sandwich. The chicken salad was very bland, but the Jalapeno sandwich was great and the potato salad. While we were eating the guy was very pleasant to a group of three females who happen to be white, but didn't seem as enthusiastic when he served a black female her food. I thought maybe it is just me, but my wife is Asian and after we ate, we got in line again to get some croissants and macaroons to go and the guy was behind the counter and didn't approach it until after we were being helped by the girl who wasn't trying to be pleasant. That person that he helped was another white woman and he was very nice to her. Maybe that was a coincidence? My wife didn't feel that way and felt discriminated. I did notice nobody put any tips in their jars.   To bad, the food was good except for the chicken salad, but we will not go back because of the service we received!",

It is silky, smooth, and has a slight tang too it. It is one of THE best hollandaise that I have ever tasted. Eggs poached to perfection, fluffy buttery brioche, crispy potatoes..my mouth is watering just thinking about it. GIVE ME MORE!...ok moving on. along with my delicious breakfast I got a caramel latte. I am a stickler when it comes to espresso, and the lady who did mine this morning had that barista magic. temp was right on point, nice creamy smooth foam. loved how the caramel did not over power the espresso. All in all two thumbs up!   keep doin ya thang Essence!",

I love it when I'm right :) 2 hours later he was still thinking about that cookie & said he wished we would have splurged and gotten the big ones.   They are new to the neighborhood. I read a couple of reviews that indicated they may not have gotten their sea legs yet. Give them a chance. We stopped in because I'd been hearing some buzz about those delicious little cookies.

I have food allergies. If you do as well I suggest you avoid this because they will not accommodate you. I tried to order the daily special sandwich without apricot. Nope, they can't do a special order because it's pre-made.  The ham sandwich without jalapenos? Nope, pre-made.  The grilled cheese without tomato? Surely they can grab 2 slices of bread, a slice of cheese, and then throw it on a grill? Nope, pre-made!   To me, this is absolutely bonkers that they can't, or refuse to, grab a piece of bread and throw a piece of cheese on it. I've heard wonderful things about the food quality, the excellent customer service, and fresh ingredients. I was clearly lied to.",

The baguette itself was authentic, & didn't disappoint; however, just about everything else did.  First of all, they don't have WiFi. What kind of a cafe doesn't have WiFi!? Or espresso, for that matter. I ordered at 2:20, & was told that I couldn't have one, because they'd already cleaned the machine. But...they're open until 3. When I went to ask for the WiFi password, I asked about it, & the girl said \"We shut down the machine at 2:30; what time is it?\" To which I replied \"2:29...\" then she said, rudely, \"and what time do we close!?\" This was a different girl than the one who took my order, who had also said (10 mins. earlier), that I couldn't have an espresso with my macaron. They were also out of the chai. I originally wanted a cold brew, which she said they had, & described an iced coffee. The teacher in me had to correct her, especially since SHE WORKS AT A CAFE, so I said \"those are not the same thing; a cold brew has a different brewing process, & is less acidic.\" She proceeded to argue with me, until the other (rude) worker finally came over & corrected her, saying \"we don't have cold brew.\" I finally settled for a drip coffee, which was weak & tasteless. There were also several dirty tables that had not been bussed, & no visible outlets for plugging in devices. One of the first things I saw when I walked in was a sign saying NOW HIRING;\" with such appalling customer service, I can see why!  It's a shame, because the food was good & authentic, albeit pricey ($10.95 for a vegetarian quiche & side salad w/ only dressing, $3.95 for a baguette). However, for those prices, I would expect great service! This might be worth a try, but only if you place your order to go, and come prepared to over-pay. To the owners: I will *personally* never return, unless perhaps you fire your FOH staff! It doesn't matter how good your product may be, if your staff is lazy, rude, and argumentative, you will never have a good business. 1 star for good food; 0 for customer service, 0 for cleanliness, 0 for amenities, 0 for prices.",

We've tried to understand how a chocolate croissant can be completely cool but still have melted, gooey chocolate on the inside. Obviously, the answer is..MAGIC, and we never pass up magic desserts at any meal.   The food is incredible. In 10 years of eating here I've liked everything I've ordered. I usually get the huevos frenchos, oat pancakes, or the special the chef creates for the week. The chef uses local, organic ingredients and is a True artist. Art takes time so don't expect to be in and out in 30 minutes if you're there for breakfast. When you want to relax into your morning, enjoying your time and your food, have a meal at Essence.",

First of all, we were sitting there quietly to review some TIME-SENSITIVE documents that are due today so we didn't get a chance to look at the menu yet. She tells us she has \"paying customers that need a table\" and looking around, at least 70% of the tables were empty!! All of the customers were of course Caucasian(which I have no issue with myself) but obviously they had an issue with me. I was truly frightened that if I didn't leave it would have led to something worse. I will never return and I'm glad I didn't spend a cent there!",

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves French-style breakfast and pastries! They serve breakfast all day on Saturday and Sunday so even if you get a late start you can still get breakfast.  As soon as we walked in and started looking at the menu the owner approached us and explained every item on their menu. She was very friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly and was to die for. I ordered the French scramble- the eggs are light, fluffy, and packed with flavor! It also comes with fantastic peppered bacon! As a thank you for trying out her restaurant the owner sent us two complimentary croissants, one chocolate and one almond, which were also mind-numbingly delicious. Will definitely be going there for breakfast again!",

Unfortunately, I have been disappointed with the two breakfasts I have tried. The French eggs were so full of mustard seed they were difficult to eat, and the caramel sauce for the French toast was just not very good (though the brioche bread it was made out of was). I might try something for lunch soon, but when I am here for breakfast again I will stick with a chocolate croissant and latte.",

(I even stayed on the Essence mailing list because we liked it so much!) So, we were thrilled when Essence decided to open a second location in our new neighborhood.  We have been to the Arcadia location several times since it opened, both during the week and on weekends. I strongly prefer this location to the Tempe one because it has the same good food and desserts but a lot more space. (The Tempe location always felt cramped, especially during rush times.) I have not been to the Tempe location in a while (so things may have changed there too), but I  appreciate that the Arcadia location has longer brunch hours, is open on Sundays, has a more diversified menu, and offers larger portion sizes.  Some of our breakfast favorites include: the sausage turnover, the \"big breakfast,\" and the french toast. Lunch favorites include: the chicken pot pie, the burger, and the quiche lorraine. The daily specials are usually really good as well. For desserts, you can't go wrong with a caramel macaroon.   I know that other reviewers have run into difficulties with parking at this location. I have never had that problem here, but maybe I've been lucky. I also have not had problems with long wait times (though I have had this problem a few times at the Tempe spot).",

We had a breakfast here as well and although it was good, it wasn't my favorite. I had the special of the day where it was a puff pastry stuffed with cream cheese, sweet peppers and asparagus. This was fantastic and would have been better if there was a meat in there(maybe sausage?) but having the peppered bacon on the side was just as good. I had a serious issue with the eggs. They are done in a french style, so I think they are baked. I had an issue with the texture and that's more of a personal thing than anything against the chef. They came off as runny as far as a scramble goes and it just didn't work for me.   Fiance had something more basic with sausage and eggs and some toast (I think) and he seemed generally please with it. He has had lunch there before and says the lunch is far better than the breakfast.   I had an iced coffee that wasn't that great, it was the caramel one and I think they used salted caramel - but ether way it was extremely bitter all while having an overly sweet after taste. I would not order this again.   Like I said the baked goods were the best for that visit and I want to go back for lunch to get a newer experience. I would feel more comfortable leaving 3.5 stars however I will give them the benefit of not being able to.",

It's not the usual huge pot pie you might find in the freezer section; instead it's a smaller, lighter, flakier, tastier version. It's served with a very simple salad of greens lightly dressed with vinaigrette in the French manner.  I liked it because you don't leave feeling like you have a lead brick in your stomach. The best way I could describe it is - elegant comfort food. Now go get one of those croissants!   Note - they are closed on Mondays. Those days I have to make do with a cardboard protein bar. Sigh.",

They are usually in a basket on top of the counter or fresh and warm inside right off the rack.   We are in Phoenix so we were happy to have one closer to us. The place is cute inside. We ordered our Chocolate Croissants, and well, they were cold part way in, we typically love to pull off the flaky crust and go to the layers underneath, it was cold, and the chocolate was stiff, Are they refrigerated? Ive just never had one like this at the other place. So it really didnt have the same experience as thats what we go there for. Hope they get things ironed out, otherwise stick with the Tempe one! Theirs are delicious!",

This place was recommended by friends, so I decided to give it a try. It does resemble the Italian breakfast a little bit   My friends were right, their baked goods are a legend. So fresh and delicious, you're naturally inclined to get more than one. Their presentation is also appealing.   I got a croissant, a raspberry danish and a small cappuccino. Cappuccino, to be honest with you, is not the best in town, but still a cappuccino. My eulogies go to the baked goods I got. Never had something that good before in Phoenix. Prices are fair. I will come back other times to try something different and see if my palate will get satisfied even more.   Watch out for parking, as this place is right on Indian School street and there is not much room for maneuvering your 4 wheel. :-) ciao!",

The owners are personal and involved and get to know their clientele which creates such a nice atmosphere. The restaurant is always kept spotless.

They had so much to pick from in the pastry window but I decided on the organic drip and the almond chocolate croissant because it had amazing reviews on Yelp.  The coffee was really good just kinda mild and I like mine a little stronger. The croissant was like bitting into heaven. OMG it was so good. Fresh, flaky, buttery.  It might be the best croissant I've ever had...I'm not exaggerating lol.  It's sweet and goes perfectly with the coffee.    The service wasn't spectacular but maybe that's because the line was long. The cashiers and servers didn't make eye contact or even smile but I will give them a pass THIS TIME.   They have a delicious looking breakfast menu so I will be back soon with the hubby for breakfast.    This place is a little hidden treasure...well maybe not so hidden since I pass it everyday LMBO",

First and foremost, I love that they asked if I wanted my bacon chewy or crispy as this is a big source of debate amongst bacon lovers. (: My scrambled eggs were literally melt-in-your-mouth creamy and the flavor medley was just outstanding. Probably THE best scrambled eggs I've ever eaten. And that latte...oh, that latte. *dreamy sigh* It was what every latte on the planet should be. The ideal drinking temperature, creamy, rich and teeming with real vanilla bean. I can't wait to come back again in the future and try something new and most certainly delectable. Hats off, Essence.",

    "text": "Best French Pastry I've been eating at Essence Bakery Cafe for many years.  Their French pastry has been fresh and delicious each time.  The Almond croissant is buttery with a hint of sweetness from the almond creme in the middle.  Their breakfast and lunch menus offer some vegetarian options, classic French meals, and some Greek dishes also.  Almost all dishes have fresh local ingredients.  They bake their own bread and sell baguettes.  They also have a To-Go refrigerated case.  La perfection!",

Been to others, but I don't remember it being so pricey and cheap at the same time?!? 1) service was good, kitchen was slow. 2) two croissants/ croissant sandwich = $16!!!!! Oh my!  I was shocked but thought it's going to be good! - croissants were very small.  Half the size of an average plastic utensil!  (See pic)! - cheese, less then a small spoon, - egg, some yellow but I think you will see in pic it escaped!!! Thank God I didn't get a drink, $30 would have been way too much! Customers: New Yorkers lost in Arcadia! Never again!",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review, it really does. I really wanted to like this place, I've heard amazing things about the Tempe location (which unfortunately I haven't been to) and was excited that there was a location nearby to visit. The location itself is really cute. It kind of reminds me of NCounter in Tempe.   Positives:  -It's a really cute cafe. The decor is kitschy and cute, with a huge mixer in the front. I like the overall minimalist design. -I like the fact that you order at the counter, even though in a large group it can be a little annoying to have food come out in rounds.  -I can see why people come here, for the baked goods. I got a chocolate croissant to share with my group and everyone agreed it was delicious.  -The food was pretty delicious. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and the banana caramel sauce is to die for.  Onto the unfortunate negatives:  Issue #1: The staff was inconsistent. Either they were overly friendly & attentive or couldn't be bothered. Case in point-The lady who took my order was very friendly & peppy. She was very helpful at offering suggestions and even up sold me on getting a pastry to share with my group while we waited for our food. Once we got our food, it was difficult to flag any of the staff down if we needed anything and if we were successful-it took an awfully long time to get what we asked for.   Issue #2: My friend and I ordered the exact same dish but got different amounts of food. My friend noted that she felt it was overpriced for what she was getting, but then was kind of upset to see that my order had way more potatoes than hers did. There should be a standard there, especially if it's pretty obvious we're at the same table?  Issue #3: The amount of time it took for our food to arrive. I understand if you're like crazy busy, but it was only moderate on our visit. Each of us pretty much ate our entire meal before the next person got their food. I understand we ordered separately but the timing was pretty close between orders.   Perhaps this place is experiencing growing pains? I don't know. I'd like to make a return visit, but I will probably wait a bit. Hopefully I can update this review with more stars.",

    "text": "I was hoping for more.  I really was.  I just got back - this is my fourth time there, always for breakfast/pastries, always willing to drop more money than usual.  If you're not a fan of reading a story, let me just sum it up:  go to Starbucks instead.  From a visual aesthetics perspective, it's not too shabby.  The place has a little bit of curb appeal, an unusually large mixer that's clearly for display purposes, and a semi-minimalistic kitschy interior.  Okay, this might not be bad...  But then you see the line.  It's sort of a cluster of people standing around the front, with a theme that implies the line starts near the door, sort of.  At 7:30AM, the crowd made me want to stand in line to get OUT of the place, not in.  Nonetheless, I made my way to order.  I was glad to see some breakfast items that I could relate to, and ultimately decided on something I wouldn't make at home: quiche lorraine.  I was promised it was \"amazing\".  It wasn't.  Now, take a 21 min intermission, because that's how long it took to get my food (yes, it took so long I started to pay attention to it).  First, let me just say that I know what a microwaved pastry tastes like.  Been there, done that.  This was more of the same.  If something is warm on the edges, but cold in the middle, consider the microwave.  F*ck, that was a waste of time and money.  I would ask for them to heat it up, but alas, look at that damn line.  My friend, who was having the french scrambled eggs, told me that it was nothing amazing.  Pretty basic.  So I had a bad experience and he had an \"acceptable\" experience.  Score: 3/5  On another trip, I lucked out, because there wasn't a line.  It's like the clouds parted and there was an open register.  I walked up, ordered some huevos frenchos, and took my seat.  Cue a 16 minute wait - hey, they're improving.  This time around, my food was decent.  I couldn't complain.  Taking advantage of the lack of line, I went back up and asked if they had coffee.  The kind gentleman gave me a cup, pointed to the coffee jug, and said \"$2.26\".  Wow, at least in Starbucks they'll fill the cup up for me at that price.  That's the recurring theme here on the food.  Moderately (not severely) expensive, with products that don't seem to match that expectation.  Now, I must say, ALL the pastries that I have tried, especially the macaroons, are delicious.  However, even the cost of a macaroon is more expensive here in Phoenix than the macaroons at Bouchon, a Thomas Fuckin' Keller creation.  This places charges considerably more and isn't even on par.  Yikes.  Funny part is, that complaint about the macaroons is really about 65 cents.  Oh well, I digress to digest.  I'll save my parking rant, whatthehelldoyouhavetodrink? rant, and more for some other time.",

    "text": "You might be asking yourself, \"Lance, why do you go to places like this, you're clearly a man's man, who takes no prisoners, and loves bad bitches\" TRUE. Valid points.  Keeping prisoners in my house would be burdensome and annoying so I generally don't do it, and my love for bad bitches is equal to my love for getting vulgar on yelp.  However, I get dragged to places like this by a woman who thinks places like this are cute. I complain, but I go for the writing material, and to get it out of the way. Otherwise, I'll be hearing about trying this place for the next 5 months.  Some people think I'm angry, some people think this is rude and disrespectful. Fuck all y'all.  If my business was shitty (not possible, but lets roll with the hypothetical) I would appreciate hearing about it and try to fix it.  Sadly, this is the 2nd location of a place that's been open forever and not the first review where people bring these facts up....so do they just not care?  Moving ON:  No one that's ever worked for, or at this company has spent more than 10 seconds thinking about business decisions, process, or even money.  I'm talking general currency, how it works....how we can exchange it for goods...how to get more of it...preferably in a shorter period of time.....like prior to death.  GET THE FUCK OFF ME SON.  There's 3 distinct things going on at this place  1) People are trying to order food, from a menu, at a counter...ok simple enough.  2) People are trying to order a pastry, or maybe $200 worth of them at same counter  3) People are trying to get coffee drinks.....or are they?  SEPARATE YOUR FUCKING CUSTOMERS  Group 3 is basically fucked, because there is no drink menu.  There is thousands of dollars of barrister equipment sitting over in a corner, but it's a complete waste if no one even knows what to order. A baby could figure this shit out.  If your theory is: \"WELL WE CAN MAKE ANYTHING\"...well fuck yourself, because most humans are crippled by open ended decisions, and I didn't see shit coming out of that area the entire time I was here.  I was asked what I wanted to drink...and I said..ummm....? I suppose water...you have to have that, right? FAIL 1. Drinks are always the money maker. They should be front and center.  Group 2 is a bunch of old women who want to bring like 60 macaroons back to their house and have a retirement party. Pure golden girls shit..\"Let's get 20, no 30 no 100...ahhhahah....lets do 3 dozen of one and 4 x 2/3 dozens of each of these other 3 hhaha..MACAROON heaven!!! Ohhh gloria you old bag, I promise I won't tell your doctor...my grandkids are going to shit themselves worse than Gladys did last night at bingo\" FUCK OUT THE WAY. I'm hung over, and I'm starving....Get Themla and Louise over to their own register like every other place that offers bakery items....OR fucking come to my table and wait on me. I don't know the split of your revenue, but whatever it is, segregate this shit. Sorry bout it Brown Vs. Board of Education.  Group 1 is me, I don't eat sweets, because I save my diabetes risk for alcohol. Also, I\"m hungry and NO MOTHER FUCKERS I DON'T WANT SALAD.  You can have any side you want, as long as it's potato salad or shitty leaves we picked off the bushes in the front. WRONG ANSWER.  Every place like this has a burger...thank fucking god..because when women start restaurants like this...strictly for other women..someone says: \"I know this is going to sound crazy....but what if a man comes in??...like by accident or whatever??? Ok fine, we'll make a burger...BUT we'll look down on you when you order it, we'll take 40 minutes to make it, and we'll assume you're a republican, with no soul, your life is probably in a downward spiral, you probably beat your wife, and also NEVER COME BACK EVER fuckface man.\"  So anyways, I got the burger....it was actually good, but it didn't fill me up, and neither did the 7 leaf salad....so I went to Pita Jungle where I ordered, ate, and paid in less time than I waited in line at whatever this place is called I'm reviewing.  PS: There's fricken 12 people working in here.There's also 12 people working at Zipps across the way. Which is at least 5x bigger, bar + full menu and is ASS PACKED. Lesson: Process improvement.",

    "text": "As a long time weekly customer of the Tempe location, I was very excited that this location opened up in my neighborhood. One by work (Tempe) one by home (Phx). Since I usually eat there for lunch while at work, it took me a while to try the new spot, which I did today for the first time.  Food: Excellent Interior: New, modern, spacious - very nice Ordering process: Annoying Parking: VERY limited - go during off peak hours  The new location is really nice and open; it feels much less cramped than the Tempe location. I ordered the special which was soup and salad with one of my favorite Essence soups - the butternut squash - and it was great, as always.  So I think the food will be good at both locations, but I did notice some of the issues that the other reviewers pointed out.  1 - I was in line behind a group of people standing at the counter trying to decide what to order. They were taking forever and never stepped to the side to let other \"ready\" customers place their orders. There are two registers and one line, but some people cut in front of me and went to the other register...they need to be more clear about the lines and how to order. Most people go there for lunch and have limited time, so efficiency is important. It is the same way at Tempe, but I think because the place is smaller it's easier to figure out what's going on and how the flow works.  2 - PARKING - there is not enough parking! This drives me nuts!!! Why open a restaurant that seats more than 10 tables and have only 10 parking spots. A building with a tiny parking lot is NOT a good location for a restaurant. There are no side streets to park on either. This is like another LGO situation...no parking and I refuse to valet my car to get a salad and dessert to go.(at LGO, Essence does not offer valet) I'm just making the point that you lose customers if there is not enough parking.",

    "text": "It pains me to have to write this review.  However, 4 visits in the first week and no improvement, makes me think its management and not growing/new opening pains.  Were to start....I will start with the experience that actually motivated me to write this review followed by the experience I had today.  Essence claim to fame is the Macaroon, so naturally being able to walk in and get a macaroon or variety of macaroon is important (have to do at least your claim to fame really well)  So I stopped in Saturday (following Friday lunch were they ran out of cheese) to buy 10 mini macaroons.  I waited in line and then promptly ordered when it was my turn.  While ordering they looked in the case to see if they had what I ordered so I assumed that they would be pulling my macaroons out of the case.  So I then peered into the case and ordered what I saw was available.  I should have know something was wrong then because she was not grabbing and putting them in a bag.  Next after repeating my order (which I have had to do every single time I have gone in) she gives me a number and says it is for my coffee.  So I am standing there twiddling my thumbs watching everyone behind me get their pastries and macaroons and leave.  So I ask \"May I have my macaroons?\"  This is followed by that will be 5-10 minutes for your macaroons!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTH are you kidding me, I just watched you give 5 people after me their macaroons.  Then one of the other women says \"Well it takes 5-10 minutes for special orders\"  DUDE YOU ARE A MACAROON STORE, ordering 10 mini macaroons is not a special order.    Then this is now followed by \"Well they are making them in the back\"  followed by a sarcastic response from me, \"really they are making them in the back\"  \"YES\"  This is were I start to lose it.  There is nothing I HATE more than being LIED to.  I watched them dodge me and never go into the back to \"make them\" and proceed to pull them out of the very case I ordered them from.  I also watched a gentlemen come in and order 10 mini macaroons and get them right then, pay and walk out.  So I point this out to the women that told me they were being made in back and mine was a special order and she looks at me and goes \"OK\".  I get you are busy, but lying and being rude doesn't help the situation.  In fact to repeat myself I hate being lied to and why lie when the customer is standing there watching you not go in back and serve other people food.    Brings me to today, I thought okay Emily, you are being way too hard on this bakery they just opened.  So my friend and I decide to go in for Brunch.  I ordered the turnover and got my food oddly fast.  Well that is because it was ICE COLD.  so I walked up with my plate and ask if they turnover was suppose to be served cold (never know) and she says no.  I so try to hand her my plate and she is looking at me like I am weird.  Then asks me to take my knife and fork and goes Ill heat it up......I reply \"are you going to nuke it\"??!?!?!?  She goes \"Ill ask for a new one\"  Almost like she was doing me a favor.    Sit back down, wait FOREVER for the new turnover (definitely did not put a rush on the turnover)  New plate hot turnover come out, and now COLD eggs.  It was at that moment I gave up.  No apology, no free mini macaroon, in fact they could seem to care less that they are the problem, and not the customer.  I understand new openings, but with a new opening generally comes customer service.  Everyone is running around like they were not trained.  You have customers coming in ordering who have never been to your store and you cant even tell them what sodas you have or were they are located.    If you are going to place your drinks around the corner, put a sign out informing your customers what beverages you serve.  Instead I tried to order a couple different things before they told me the drinks were in a case around the corner.  So to summarize, I find the staff rude, the service slow, uninformative. and food mediocre.  It will probably do well because it is in Arcadia, however this Arcadian who loves macaroon will not go back unless its because the other dining party wants to go and I will continue to drive to Classic Cake and Confections to get my macaroons at least they act like they appreciate my business.",

We found ourselves at the counter between 2 registers not being helped due to our unfortunate location whilst perusing the baked goods display.  Whatever.  We ordered an almond cookie, a chocolate macaroon and a chocolate almond croissant.  This came out to about 10 dollars.  Seeing as I didn't see coffee on the menu and had no idea what kind of pricing they decided to place on it I decided to get  the coffee elsewhere.  Make sure you watch them fill your order, the lady tried to give me a regular chocolate croissant.  So the macaroon I decided I like.  Its like a dense raw-in-the-middle brownie.  Or a truffle brownie dumpling.  Delightful.    The cookie is mediocre.  I don't think I'd get it again.  The chocolate almond croissant was DELICIOUS!  Then I uncovered a short black curly hair that I couldn't come up with any alternative for besides originating from someone's lower pubic region.    For the price they charge for their goods, I should be able to expect a hairless experience.  Even if it was a head hair or an eyelash I may have just brushed it off, no pun intended.",

I got in line and paid for it, leaving my lunch on the table. 15 mins later, it still hadn't been delivered. I flagged two staff members. \"Would it be possible to bring my soup?\"  They blew me off. I asked to speak with the owner. Sacre Bleu ...zut alors. She blew me off. I left having paid for my soup and declared that I would never go back.

Needless to say, I couldn't have been more excited about the new Phoenix location - which is 2 seconds from my house! I took my Mother-in-law, visiting from Sweden last week & we had a lovely lunch. We both ordered the Greek Caesar but ultimately should have split one salad between us because when our order came out we both received our own small mountain of Greek Caesar !   Long story short, my only complaint is receiving too much Greek Caesar!? This isn't even a complaint! Essence is FAB!  Thank you Essence! :)",

The service has always been friendly and efficient, and everything I've tried has been delicious. They have daily specials which I usually order that have always turned out to be a good choice. The portions are generous for the price, and they use high quality ingredients. At an average price of $10 for lunch, I think this is a great value compared to a lot of other restaurants in the neighborhood. After dining here several times I finally decided to try a mini caramel macaron. They forgot to bring it out with my meal, so to make up for it they brought me an extra vanilla one complimentary. Totally unnecessary, but a very nice gesture!  The macarons were as good as the ones I've had in Paris. I highly recommend the caramel one, so rich and amazing, I can't wait to try more.",

When I got home (I only live 2 minutes away) there was no bacon and the eggs were super cold. It was just flavorless potatoes and cold eggs so I ended up just making myself a breakfast with the potatoes and my owns eggs. I would have gone back but I never got a receipt and I was starving so I didn't want to go back and wait for a whole new meal. It was just disappointing I was super excited for a new breakfast place in my neighborhood. I used to work in restaurants so I know that employees don't pay attention to the details when it gets slow but simply printing a receipt would have helped me.",

For example, the Mediterranean Platter has been slightly changed at this location. It's like somebody decided they wanted to put their own spin on it ... the horror.  Exhibit A: the baguette. What's the deal with the strip of bread sliced in half? In Tempe, the baguette consists of toasted slices of an actual baguette.  Exhibit B: the chopped Greek salad has spinach added to it. Why? It's so good the way it comes in Tempe. There is no need to add some dry ass leaves to it.   In conclusion, I can't image the female version of Gordon Ramsay, who started Essence, would approve of someone messing with her creations (this is something I assume based on no evidence other than my imagination after little interaction). Also, I am way too into my food.",

And my friend's breakfast sandwich was delicious, too! The only drawback is that the portions are really small, but the prices aren't proportionate.

If you go in the morning, I highly recommend the Almond Chocolate Croissant.  It is seriously out of this world delicious, especially when it's fresh 1st thing in the morning.    The other item I 100% recommend is trying any flavor of their macarons.  They are so light and fluffy yet packed full of flavor.  And if you can't decide on just one, you can buy mini macarons to try out a myriad of flavors.  Seriously, I'm salivating just thinking of them, they are that good!!

But we'll get back to that.  Inside is bright and clean with friendly employees. The parking is a nightmare. The back has a small lot with about dozen spots. An employee was standing outside \"working\" the traffic for the lot but he just stood there against the building. Unbelievable. I had to look for myself to see if there was a spot as when I asked, he said to go check. Okay, thanks for doing your job.  Order process was fast and simple. End of that.   The brioche. What the heck happened to their brioche loaf? In Tempe location, it was fluffy and light and delicious but in Phoenix location, it was at least a day old, too eggy and dry. Their brioche was the best thing but wow. I hope the Tempe location hasn't change.  The macaron. Seriously?! The shell - too many air bubbles, cracked, uneven, hollow and spread too much. The filling - too runny and curdled. The filling is only in the center instead of spread out entirely. Majority of the flavor is supposed to come from the filling that soaks into the shell but when the filling is only in the center, the flavor can't spread. You get the filling in the middle but the rest of the macaron is just eating the shell. As a pastry chef, those are the shells that would have never seen the light of day. It is an insult to be served those inadequate macarons, let alone pay for it. Who cares if its big? It's just more flavorless shell to eat. I would rather have macarons from AJ's fine foods. I saw worse macarons in the case so I hope they never sell those to their customers.   Absolute and utter disappointment.",

I asked if I could not have as much syrup in my order of the signature caramel glace (I don't like overly sweet coffee). I was confused by her answer, but I remember her saying it was a pre-made mix and they couldnt adjust the sweetness to coffee ratio, but they could put more milk in there. Ok? I ordered an iced coffee, and I really didn't like it. It was watery and too bitter at the same time, which all comes down to the roast.   Food - I instantly wanted to order their special (scrambled eggs with herbs, peppers, served with baguette and nutella and bacon). The special sounded SO delicious and it sounded like a huge plate of food, that I decided to share the plate. What came to our table was a tiny amount of eggs, about the size of an older iphone. Since it was the special I was expecting so much more than a tiny amount of unflavorable, unremarkable, un-wow food.   Based on this experience, I won't be stopping in here again. Nothing wrong with the service or anything, but I expect the special to be, well, special!",

If you are not into that they have someone to valet your ride but it's worth checking out no matter how you get there.",

We placed our order at the counter after some playful banter with our host and sat down to catch up on our going on's and wait for our breakfast. I ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich which included organic eggs, Dubliner Cheese, a beautiful slice of Tomato plus ham and Avocado on a Brioche bun ($7.35). The sandwich itself was a bit small even though the bun gives it a lot of height. And that makes it a bit hard to eat. However, everything tasted great and for $7.35 it's a decent deal. (Not as good as Morning Squeezes' Build Your own however). T ordered a French Butter Croissant ($2.55) which we both enjoyed. This was a great Croissant. T and I discussed how difficult it can be to create a great Croissant and it seems that Essence has got it down. T also ordered The Big Breakfast ($9.75). This comes with 2 Organic Eggs served with Mashed Potato Cake, Breakfast Sausage, Sauteed Mushrooms and Toast with Jam. T said his breakfast was very good and he thought the price was fair. Once we were finished with our breakfast I picked up a Neapolitan to take home to K. She took it to work and made everyone jealous. She said it was phenomenal. Awesome. It seems that a lot of people like the Macarons and they were definitely available in a lot of flavors. But, both T and I agreed they looked a bit, how should I say, not the best. So we passed.  Great space, great staff, good food, great Neapolitan, great available pastries, fair prices. 4 Stars.",

Everywhere I go they taste funky and dry. My friend said the owner is a French lady or she lived in France or something and she brought back the secret ingredients! I would definitely order a caramel or vanilla bean rum macaroon every time I come here.",

We stopped in for a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee after running an errand on Saturday morning and we're pleasantly surprised by our experience. We were greeted with smiles and when they found out if was our first visit, both women behind the counter, one of which was Lisa, helped us pick out some of their unique pastries and were kind and patient. We ended up buying 2 croissants - one baked with honey and one pumpkin and their classic breakfast sandwich. AMAZING!! Fresh and flavorful. Lisa came over and asked about our experience and brought it to our attention that if you come around 9ish AM on Saturday, that's when another round of pastries are coming out of the oven. Let's just say, the chocolate croissants are worth it! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back!",

I know, stupid - The best way to blow a workout!  Anyway, there's plenty of parking in the back and when we walked in, the cafe is pretty roomy. We scrutinized the menu a little bit and I finally decided on an iced vanilla latte with non-fat milk. They didn't offer coconut or almond milk, which is a bummer. The flavor wasn't bad, but not the best.  I also ordered the Lorraine quiche. It came with a side of fruit and the fruit was fresh and tasty. The quiche was ok. I've had better quiches.  I also decided to order a dozen mini macaroons to take home and indulge in later. Every time I start feeling sorry for myself, I'll just pop a macaroon in my mouth to make myself feel better (that's the plan). I just had two - the raspberry one and the espresso one. They were pretty damn good and yes, I already felt sorry for myself twice since I left the cafe!  Don't judge!!!",

My Macarons were so good that I ordered three more to take home (Pistachio, Strawberry, and Mocha). I think their Macarons are reasonably priced.

    "text": "First time Yelper here.  I really like this place.  I love the pastries (on par with what you would find in France), their homemade coffee drinks (no commercially made syrups), the Greek platter, and ice teas.  They taste genuine.  I can always find a parking space, and the service is friendly.  I usually end up near the 44th and Camelback corridor for breakfast or weekend lunch, and since discovering this place a couple of months ago, I nearly always end up here now.  I travel quite a bit near and far for both business and leisure; we Phoenicians are lucky to have this place.",

I have gone in 4 times and have promised myself not to waste my money on any of their food items except for their pastries. Even those are over priced. Cake the size of a small muffin for $7.95! I am sure no one has that kind of money, but I just talked myself out of going back to Essence since I can always go to LGO!",
