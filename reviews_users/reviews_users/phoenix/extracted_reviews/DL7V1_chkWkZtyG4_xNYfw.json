    "text": "The biggest problem with Pei Wei is attempting to find an available parking space. This particular location shares building space with Starbucks and The Side Bar. At certain times of the day or night (lunch/dinner ), it's nearly impossible to find parking. The solution I've found is to pass the Pei Wei parking lot on McDowell and turn left into the business parking lot for EBL instead. They tend to have open parking spots (watch out for reserved spaces) that are a lot closer than parking across the street. In fact, I usually park at the EBL lot and walk to Pei Wei or Starbucks that way I'm never creeping around the lot, stalking patrons for their prime parking spaces.   My co-workers and I frequent Pei Wei on a weekly basis. We order online and pick up at the restaurant; I've never, in the 2 years we've been doing this, had a problem with an online order. (We did have issues with call-in orders, but that has been over a year ago when they forgot to include my entree. I made a trip back, my order was comped, and I was given two free lettuce wrap coupons. I left happy.) Often times, if we have more than a few minutes wait, Pei Wei comps us free drinks. (AKA Awesome customer service!) Their computerized drink machines are just too cool - any place that allows me to select syrups to add to my fountain drink is A-OK in my book.   During the past two years, I've had the opportunity to sample nearly every item on the menu. My absolute favorites are (in no particular order): Coconut Curry Chicken, Shrimp Pad Thai, Ginger Broccoli (their version of beef & broccoli - tastes similar to the Mongolian which is also delicious), Japanese Chile Ramen with Beef, Pei Wei Spicy & Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad, Crab Wontons, Lettuce Wraps, and the Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls (though I am the only one of my friends who likes the salad rolls).   A handy tip for those ordering online is the \"customize\" button. This allows you to select whether you'd like to add extra sauce (for free!) to your order or for the cooks to make your entree extra spicy. There's a bunch of other options to choose from like steaming veggies or protein selections.  Pei Wei is one of my favorite restaurants. I even like it better than (gasp) P.F. Chang's because you can get some of the exact same dishes (Spicy Chicken, Mongolian, Lettuce Wraps) for a lot less cash. I also love the ambiance of the downtown Phoenix location - the red brick walls and unique flooring do a lot to add the kind of personality that most restaurant chains lack.   Whether you're dining in or picking your meal up, you really can't go wrong with Pei Wei.",

On my last visit I opted the the yellow curry Thai noodles with tofu. First i would like to say is that the Tofu at Pei Wei is some of the best, it is firm and has a skin with a different texture than the bulk of it. The noodles were standard floppy wide  rice noodles with with some veggies. the sauce did lack the punch you would get from a genuine Thai place however.  Some other nice things about this chain include: *Order at the counter format: save on the tip *Self serve fountain drinks: Faster refills impress the date by getting them for her * Many condiments: Spice the meal to taste. *All you can eat fortune cookies: Don like your fortune? Try another!  Parking here can be a bit of a challenge, but you can park on the next residential block south of here.  There also is only one menu, so lunch prices can be a bit steep, crossing the $10 line.",

I settled for a regular size KungPao with noodles for an extra 99 cents and a  drink for two dollars and change. Which brought my total to around $13 dollars .         The ambiance basically sit yourself, and you wait for them to bring your food to your table. The food itself wasn't all that spicy and under whelming to say the least, but it was edible, for the most part. I have to say that I would find spicier Asian food from Panda Express and that's not saying much considering the fact this is the height of Americanized faux Asian food.   Frankly, if I wanted lackluster food I could easily purchase some hot pockets from any grocery store or just grab something to eat from Mcdonalds.Thanks but no thanks",

As an Asian, this place is not your typical Asian food.  It's very Americanized Asian food and is a favorite of my friends who are not Asian.  I don't enjoy the noodle dishes, but I did enjoy the new \"Korean Steak Lettuce Wrap\".  It was very salty, but full of flavor.  If you like very flavorful food and you want to eat a little healthier... well kind of try, try out this dish.    Overall, not my favorite place, but it's good.  BTW, be careful when parking. This place can be a challenge when trying to find a parking spot as it gets superful due to the complex sharing it with starbucks.  I would go during off hours and if you go during popular hours, look twice when backing out.",

When we've asked why they don't answer their phones they say their phones aren't working.  My wife actually drove down to the location while she's still on hold to order! Not sure what's happened with management of this location, dining area always looks disheveled and dirty, the quality of the orders has gone down and the customer service has slipped tremendously.

The condiments station was organized and stocked! And even more impressive, the staff was high energy!!   I run a restaurant in Scottsdale, and I would have this night compare with my restaurant, and I'm very proud of mine! Very high quality staff here!  But what added the cherry on top, we thought we ordered Spring Rolls, but noticed we didn't have it on our receipt so we didn't push anything, obviously, but Kevin, who was hustling all night, went over and above to get us some Spring Rolls. This truly invested in our experience here and we will be here more often! We live at The Muse on Central and McDowell, so we will be here more often.   We appreciate this night so much!",

After about 10 minutes, a cashier comes to the table.   Cashier: \"Did you order the hot and sour soup?\"  Me: \"Yes\"   Cashier: \"Well we are out of hot and sour soup\"   Me: \"Who places the food orders around here? Are you out of everything?\"  Cashier: \"I can either refund you or bring you wanton soup\"   Me: \"I don't want wanton soup so i want a refund. What's the fastest way to do this because I'm not standing in that line to get a refund.\"  Cashier: \"The fastest thing is for you to get wanton soup\".   I thought that was especially cute.   After she went and refunded the soup she kindly explained that my refund won't show up for a few days and make sure I check because sometimes they don't go through.   Pei Wei are you kidding?

I had only had a bottle of water and a banana for breakfast, so a hot meal was in order. The person who brought the food to the table (I'm sorry, we could not tell if they were a man or a woman) was unfriendly and almost comatose. We said \"thank you\" when the food was presented and this person just stared at us. So my regular sized Mongollon Beef was tasty and I enjoyed it. Well...I enjoyed it until about 45 minutes after returning to the office. Montezuma's revenge like you would not believe. It was my lunch, there's no question about it. (I'll spare everyone the graphic details), but let's just say I can't stay out of the ladies room now. So.... I definitely won't be returning. Someone in the kitchen is either not washing their hands, or they came to work sick when they should have stayed home. OR the food is not being kept at proper temperatures. Me thinks the kitchen crew needs to re-take the test for their food handler's card. Not happy Pei Wei. You should do much better than this.",

This time my husband left without placing an order. We go to Pei Wei for the convenience, but honestly there are too many options in Phoenix to continue to give this place our business. On a side note, I'm not sure why the social media team for this chain keeps directing customers to submit a comment on their website. I have done this, as requested, and received NO response! I am left to assume that this chain has gotten so big that they no longer care about dissatisfied customers.",

The spicy lettuce wrap was missing and the two other that we did receive came with brown soggy lettuce! Not only was the lettuce brown and soggy but we also didn't get any of the sauces nor any silverware. There was nothing wrong with the salad but I was blown away that they would send out lettuce in such bad condition and expect customer to eat it! It's so disappointing to be excited to have a good meal during my 30 min lunch but now I'm stuck eating chips for lunch!I love pei Wei and i hope this location can get it together because it's the closes one to my job!!

PeiWei you can do better.    I get a better bang for my buck at Panda or Tokyo Joes.",

The last two times I have tried to order take out they phone rang for 8 and 17 minutes, then just to make it even worse ... having ordered chicken pad-thai they instead gave me tofu pad thai. I called to talk to the manager and they said there was no manager on call ... really ? They said I would get a call back the next day ... 72 hours later still no call.  Bad customer service Not worth the effort ... there are lots of other food places on 7th ave and McDowell ...",

And we always order the same thing and every time they get our order wrong! They each order Thai dynamite with tofu and I order the salad wth tofu. They always burn the tofu and we pay for extra tofu but they don't put it on there. It's really frustrating because the employees aren't helpful and are very rude. When you ask them for something they get bothered and they are slow. They never greet kindly and they always look upset to be working. There is only one girl that is actually nice. I feel like the mangers don't even care because we have addressed this issue to them before and they said they would send us a coupon of some sort and they never did. It would be fine if they got our order wrong once or even twice but they get it wrong every single time! I love their food but they never get it right and have the worst customer service. You don't burn chicken and give it to the customers so why is it okay to burn the tofu?",

I've been to other Pei Wei locations before and absolutely love the Steamed Spicy Korean Steak on brown rice. Because of that, I went for with something new.   Tonight, I had Steamed Honey Seared Steak on brown rice. I chose this dish, because I like garlic sauce, scallions, and red bell peppers that it comes with. I never had rice sticks or had honey mixed with the sauce before. So I was curious how this dish would taste. It was pretty good.  The service was spot on and quick. I would go here again, but next time would ask if they have the Spicy Korean dish still available. Next time, I would change it up by getting Steamed Spicy Korean Chicken on brown rice.   I'll update with what the experience was.",

Hello, don't inflame your mistake by treating the customer poorly and justifying your error by counting what is on the plate.  Than the manager comes over while I decided to request a refund a $25.00 gift card purchased on this visit meant for a friend as a gift, as who could send their friend to this location, not I?  So, I paid for my meal and was treated very poorly after their mistake, as he further inflames the situation by repeating the same inflammatory comments as the previous employee.  You saved 3 pieces of chicken on the partial replacement that I would never accept either way due to the brutal ineptitude of this staff, as lost a customer at this specific location forever!!!!  Happy to go to other Pew-Wei's in the future!  The employee who refunded the gift card, handled the situation well, as feel sorry for her and the staff that are under this specific manager...",

I feel that the dishes here are healthy and well presented. Pretty much everything can be made with  just tofu and vegetables. However be sure to ask since some dishes are not complete vegetarian, they are cooked in oysters sauce. I love the fact that they have Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai food here, but where is Filipino? It would be great if they add Vegetarian Adobo or Pancit Noodles. Those can be made vegetarian or even vegan. I think the staff here is very nice, the food is reasonably priced  and the establishment is clean.    You know another good thing about this particular location? You can pick up the free wi-fi from Starbucks next door.",

We waited over 15 minutes for our food - which they brought out separately.  My husband's arrived.  Then mine.  Then my niece's.  These were not spaced out by 1 minute - we're talking 3-5 minutes.  That is a long time for food to sit and get cold if you are being polite and waiting for others to eat.  I ordered the diner select honey seared chicken like I *always* do.  When it arrived, I counted my chicken pieces.  That's right - there were so few I counted them.  I had exactly 5 little chicken morsels (about the size of a piece of popcorn chicken) for my $6.50 + drink dinner.  I think I could have done better at Panda, thanks, and your quality isn't THAT much better that I would turn my nose up at Panda to eat your 5 chicken bites.  DH was okay with his steak - although in my opinion there wasn't enough of that either.  Overall we'll keep going to Pei Wei, but the 7th Avenue location is off our list.",

They are usually very conveniently located, you can order online, everything is yummy, they are very consistent (what you had tasted last week will be the same the next), and their quality is very good. They even have some options for reducing the calories on your favorite entrees.   That being said I am clearly a fan, however this location has let me down a few times. Nothing major, you just might want to double check your bag before leaving with your take out.   I requested some soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce to go with my food, he assured me they were in the bag, I took his word for it, went on my way and was very disappointed when I got home, mouth watering from the smell that enveloped my car, and saw NO sauce, of either flavor.  I was out out of soy sauce at home, so my rice was a little sad. I am not a huge fan of their sweet and sour sauce anyhow, so that wasn't a huge let down.   My faves are the lettuce wraps (DUH!), crab wontons (very crabby, fake krab but whatev), honey seared chicken (sweet), Mongolian beef (green onions are great), and Jon likes the sweet and sour chicken (good veggies).",

    "text": "Quick Review: Terrible register service or service alone. Great food for what it is. Nice and fast line cooks. Entry way is convenient for both dine-in and quick pick-up order online. Decent available for seats interior. Exterior, nothing special.  Long Review: I have been here, at least, 4 times and the food is always great and cooked consistently. My problem here isn't about the food, but the service. I am baffled at the staff members that works on the front house such as the register, etc. How is it okay for them to think that it was okay for me to literally stand still for 15 minutes just to come pick-up my order, in which, it was already done before I arrived and all they had to do is literally give me the ordered food that is already packed? I stand there looking bored and possibly frustrated. Even the line cook in the back house was worried and even told the staff that works up-front to do something about it. Seriously, how is that possible? Every single time I came here just to pick-up my order, it always has to take more than 5 minutes, when in actuality, it only take 2 - 3 minutes, and maybe even less than a minute to give me my order. Seriously, all they had to do is hand me over the order, that is it. How hard is it? Even a simpleton or a 5 years old kid could do it. But anyway, besides my complaint, the cooks are good and the food they make for us is excellent. If you are here for the food, you are in luck, but if you're here for the service too, well, it sucks, that's my warning. They need to either hire more front-house staff or manage them right because it is a fail. How is it possible that the line-cookers are faster than the front-house staff and service. It's completely the opposite of French cuisine.   Overall: If there is a better Pei Wei, I suggest you go there instead of here until they can manage their staff right. Otherwise, if you seriously don't mind the crappy service, well knock yourself out and go here, I suppose if you're in for aspired Americanized Asian food.",

I'm not sure what dish was prepared for me, but it was a far stretch from the order.   The order modifications were not even considers, and my extra sauce on the side was clearly just water that rinsed the cooking pan and put into a container.     I can be sympathetic to mistakes happening but this was clearly a lack of effort or care from the kitchen.   When I called to ask for the order to be remade I sat on hold for 15 minutes from 9:15 pm to 9:30...when they close.     Obviously the staff didn't want to receive another order or likely another complaint as they were ending the night.   If your in the mood for Asian food in central Phoenix go to Panda Express or China Chili.   Save yourself the frustration, I should have learned my lesson with my pervious poor experiences.",

As a last resort I came in and almost every table was empty but there was a very long line to the door with only one person taking orders.

Anywhere else and you get decent lettuce that you can actually make a wrap out of. But not this location. Every time I get lettuce wraps it's like the choose the lowest quality shreds of lettuce to give me. Not just whole pieces of lettuce but literally shreds. How the hell and I supposed to make a wrap out of lettuce that comes all yellow and shredded up? It all goes down the same but they shouldn't call it lettuce wraps.

Of course you have many other opportunities to eat better food in downtown Phoenix, but let's not take away the convenience, location, an early opening time and the fact that a heavy rotation of cops and troopers keep the zombies of 7th Ave at bay.  We've all been to Pei-Wei so I won't describe the food, other than to comment that a every dish seems to be getting increasingly saltier with every visit.  My spicy korean bowl with tofu and vegetables seemed to be positively drenched with salty goo...  perhaps the kindly staff took pity on my tofu-ness and decided to compensate with every tool in their flavor arsenal.  Or perhaps I just was feeling salt sensitive.  Their salads are consistently flavorful and fresh, though I can't say I've ever encountered anything like them on my travels in Asia.  Pei Wei is a successful Arizona invention from the team that started PF Changs so we should be proud of what they get right, and keep them honest on what they get wrong.",

It came out with no snow peas. My fiance asked about it and the server says, \"yeah, we just ran out of them\". No extra peanuts, no \"can I substitute something else for you?\"...nothing. End of discussion, apparently.   Tonight we go in about 7:30pm and my fiance was daydreaming a bit after he received his receipt. The cashier informed him, \"you can leave now\".  We receive our usual; his Kung Pao Chicken and my lettuce wraps. His Kung Pao noodles were so overcooked they were like chewing paste. My lettuce wraps tasted fine, but two hours later and I was incapacitated with stomach pains. Just finished expunging the remainder of the wraps, and I am starting to feel okay. And no, it could not have been anything else I ate. Or a virus. They don't come and go so quickly.   Next time we are craving Pei-Wei, we will be making the drive to the East Phoenix location.",

(Hi fans)  Let's talk portions. Minimal. Miniscule. Micro. Don't expect the same portion you would get sitting down to dine. And don't expect to pay less for it. They cheat you, plain and simple.  Let's talk RIce. The worst white rice I've every had in a take-out. Mushy or rock hard lumps. Need I say more?  Let's talk Sauce. At this store they consider sauce a garnish. You get more moisture from the soy sauce packet. If they gave you 1/4 the rice, it would be the right amount for the entree sauce they serve up. As it is, what you get will just about color half the rice portion.  Finally, accuracy. It is near impossible to get a perfect order from these people. I've tried ordering pork three times and got chicken twice and beef once. The last time I opened it in-store and said \"I'd like pork in my Mongolian Pork please.\" It was chicken. It was a long wait for cold food.  This has to be the worst-run Pei Wei in the franchise. Don't pay the premium price - you won't get your money's worth.",

I placed my order just like that. The person ringing me up seemed very distracted as she asked me three times if I wanted brown or white rice. I said rice noodles a total of FOUR times. I got my order and brought it back to work for lunch. When I opened it up, the first thing that I noticed was that it was made with regular noodles, not rice noodles. The worst part, though, was that EVERY SINGLE PIECE of chicken was chewy and fatty. Disgusting!! Never going to this location again.",

You order as you walk in, and receive your drink from the cashier. You fill your beverage and have a seat.  The waitress brings you your food.   You will not get a paper cup.  You will eat off of real plates with real utensils.  If you need a refill, just ask!  Staff is more than happy to help.  It is very low maintenance and quick.

Our order was taken efficiently but when the food came, the beef dish we ordered was super salty!  So we hailed a server and told her that the dish was too salty.  All she could say was, do you want to have the dish changed?  So we decided to have only one order replaced since we were halfway through eating the other order which came with the fried rice (that we liked) we would changed just one order of the same dish.  We had ordered two.  So she took one dish away and also removed the other dish.  Maybe we had a communicated breakdown (she could barely speak English), but she replaced only one dish.  So why did she take the other dish away too????  She had an angry face and was not happy at all!  Guess my complaint is, we paid for a dish, it got taken away and there was no offer to refund us???  Yes, one order was replaced, which was still too salty but we decided to just let it go.  That's all I have to say about that...",

    "text": "This location is on my list!   Let me give you a rundown of what happened last week.  Keeping in mind I have been to this location many times and have had a great experience.   We were hungry, didn't know what to get so we did the old standby and went to Pei Wei.  We went in, place our order:  -Pei Wei Spicy Chicken Salad -Thai Dynamite Chicken with brown rice -Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls. We were handed a buzzer (#8) because we were taking it to-go and were told the order will be about 10 min.... 15 min passed and I thought wow this is taking awhile, but I didn't want to be pushy so we waited, and waited, and waited and at 20 min, I looked at a table of people that placed their order after us. They were enjoying their meal... WHAT THE....?!?!?! So I walked over and said, \"excuse me we haven't been buzzed and the people that placed their order after us seem to be enjoying their meal.\"  She looked over at a bag just sitting on the counter (for God knows how long) and laughed and said in a \"giggly voice\" can I get you chop sticks or forks.  I thought to myself, it's not EVEN worth getting mad, just leave... So I said both please, and left.    Meanwhile we get to our destination, open our bag to:  - Coconut Curry Chicken - a container with a plain salad - a container of chicken that goes in a lettuce wrap - Vietnamese Chicken Salad Rolls(that looked like they were rolled by a waffle cone maker.  -and a sack of condiments.   WHAT THE.....?!?!?!?!  So I am LIVID at this point, but my partner makes the call, because I would probably reach through the phone at this point.... Everything was resolved over the phone.  Unfortunately, for us our dinner experience did not meet our expectations on any level...   I have been here when this manager  was working before.  I remember him being extremely helpful, very nice, and really knows his customer service.   Unfortunately, I think it was a result of one person that completely ruined my experience.  It will be some time before I go to this Pei Wei again.",

The potstickers are quite good, I like the Pei Wei Spicy Beef.  My wife tends to order the lettuce wraps, but has been disappointed with the quality of the lettuce at least once.  All of our visits here have been for carryout.  They handle phone orders very efficiently.  Parking is problematic here.  There are a couple of spots reserved for carryout but they are not respected.  There have been a couple of times when it looked like I might have to park across 7th Ave in the antique store, but I have been lucky so far.",

    "text": "True story: when Pei Wei first started, I got stuck on an airplane seated next to some VP from PF Chang's. Of course, PF Chang's created Pei Wei.   At the time I was young, (he was hitting on me), and he said, \"you say, 'Pay-Way'...but the inside/inside joke is: say 'pee-wee, like a little PF Chang's.\"  \"LIKE A LITTLE PF CHANGS\". That's what he said and it's been denied ever since, by everyone who ever lived. This was at least two corporate owners ago, so the \"deny/deny/deny\", at this point, is plausible   So when they opened, I went once, probably got orange chicken, which in America, at any Asian restaurant, is waaaaaaaaaaaaay too sweet.  I've never gone back.  I saw an Pei Wei ad on TV ad this week comparing Pei Wei and Panda Express. Said it was fresher, white meat vs dark...sounded good.  I know Panda Express is wretched but it's fast, it's not that wretched and there are items less sweet than friggin' orange chicken. So this ad convinced me to at least TRY Pei Wei and  I gave it another shot.  {couldn't easily sign up for the club, btw}  Looking at the menu online (and, oh, by the way, fix the phones and website. You know who you are) I saw Dan Dan Noodles and recalled eating this dish at PF Chang's years ago.   Memo to Pei Wei menu writers: people eat with their eyes. Words on a menu?????  So, when you describe Dan Dan Noodles with \"House-ground white meat chicken...\" who is that appealing to?  Who seeks out \"ground chicken\"?  No one.  Fried chicken, yes. Ground chicken?  Hoo-fah!  Even the rest of the description doesn't make up for it: \"House-ground white meat chicken, garlic and scallions, wok-seared in a chile soy sauce and served over steamed noodles. Finished with steamed bean sprouts and fresh julienne cucumbers.  (Somewhat Spicy)\"  While in line,I was distracted from the Dan Dan by the \"JAPANESE STEAK & SHRIMP CHILE RAMEN. Described:  \"NEW RECIPE! Wok-seared house-cut marinated flank steak, fresh-cooked shrimp and noodles in a spicy-savory Japanese sauce with minced garlic, red bell peppers, carrots, snap peas, onions, cilantro and lime.\"  BETTER!  Friggin' delicious!  Really.  Steak and shrimp, spicy. Good!  $10- good deal, good flavor.    Don't understand the service-sort of 1/2 server.",

I have been to this Pei Wei multiple times where there is only one employee manning both the take away and the dining room ordering registers. This means that take-away customers have to wait to pick up their order, which is getting warm (if sushi) or cold (if a hot meal) as the dining room customers debate the finer points of lettuce wraps and the characteristics of the different types of rice.  This inefficiency makes what used to be a convenient take-out restaurant into a chore requiring infinite amounts of patience.  Management: pony up for an extra employee from 11-2! There are too many other decent take-out restaurants nearby. The food here is fine but not good enough to warrant the irritation of waiting through this unnecessary delay.",

    "text": "Service was TERRIBLE. Last time we ate here we didn't feel so hot the next day so it took us about a year to give it another try. We got take out, ordered there then waited for it. We waited as people after us were getting their food. When we asked about ours (at least 20 min later), the cashier said they were waiting on the spring rolls. Still waiting about 5 minutes later the cashier asked the chef if they had the spring rolls and he said he had already made them. Well turns out they never made them and we had to wait another 5 or so minutes for them to be finished. Also they had no carbonation for their beverages, however they were nice enough to tell the customers before hand but that didn't leave really any drink options.  Much better service the second time! Got the orange chicken, it's still good, large portions (even the small) and the drink machine worked!!",

Survey # 833-217-100-056-213. After all these years Pei Wei still can't figure out how to find a proper dispenser for the Hot Mustard & Chile Sauce. New smaller containers are perhaps more hygienic but impossible to get liquid out of dispenser. How many people sitting in glass tower Pei Wei offices can't figure this tiny problem out? You obviously have management problems.",

    "text": "I like Pei Wei and I think their food is great - I would give them 4 stars in general as a restaurant and I recommend most of their food items (and have happily eaten most items on their menu!) - however, I have some problems with this particular location:  1. Whenever I go in there, the floor is sticky. I mean gross sticky where you feel like you might lose a shoe sticky! I originally thought it was that someone spilled something (like a soda) on the floor, but every time I go in there it is the same. Also it is almost the entire floor; so either they have a lot of spills and they never wash the floor or whatever they are using to wash the floor is leaving a gross sticky film on the floor. It's not a uniform stickiness either - it's better or worse depending on what part of the floor you are walking on - and the bathroom floor is extremely sticky! I have not encountered this at any of the other 4 locations I have eaten at...  2. Reward points - every time I go in there, they ask for my phone number so I can earn my points but then I never see the points on my account - so either the employees do not know what they are doing, or their registers are not talking to the computer that logs and tracks points. Two of my friends have the same problem with earning points at this location. They need to fix their system so that we can start getting the points we earn by buying food there!  Update: Went back today and boy! What an improvement! The floor was immaculate and no stickiness anywhere - well done!! I hope it stays this way. As for the points, I cannot attest, as I just chose to get my receipt and scan it in myself for the points...",

Also it's very unpleasant because there are 2 different musics blaring right next to each other 1 from Starbucks 1 from Pei Wei and that should be addressed. When I got my food I was also extremely disappointed as my lettuce wraps were so oily I couldn't eat them so I just left. The staff here needs to get it together. Very disappointing.",

In particular, the Orange Peel shrimp (and chicken.)  I like that dish at P.F. Chang's as well, but preferred it at Pei Wei because they added thinly sliced carrots as well as snap peas to the dish.  The protein, shrimp or chicken were lightly dusted with a breading and the entire dish was flavorful with a nice light sauce.   However, their new dish, Wei Veggie Orange Chicken (subbed shrimp), has heavily breaded shrimp, is about half the size of the dish they used to serve and is sickeningly sweet.  I won't go back.",

First off, it is faaaar from being authentic Asian.  The menu comprise of Chinese, Japanese, and Thai inspiration.  For a full meal with drink, the average cost is $9-10.  The 'Noodle and Rice Bowls' is going to be your bang for your buck dishes.  My favorites are Pad Thai and Fried Rice.  Very tasty! No matter how big my appetite is, I always end up boxing it later, but it'll make a great snack later!! :)  My other favorite is the Mongolian Beef! Very tasty!!  The keyword is TASTY! not Authentic, but TASTY!  If you are not familiar, most dishes come with WHITE or BROWN rice.  The flavor and ultimate concept is to please the general taste bud who  adores Chinese and Japanese food without the exotic ingredients.  Simple Asian packed with TASTY flavors!  If you seek authentic Chinese or Japanese, then you need to Yelp else where! That is the only caveat! ;-)  Also, this particular location is ALWAYS packed during lunch time. ALWAYS!  So expect a line between 11am and 12pm.  Parking is going to be very scarce too during this peak time!",

Their wonton soup is pretty much broth with a couple of wontons.  The blazing noodles are ok, but are a bit too spicy for me.   The worst thing about this location is their teeny tiny parking lot. You can rarely ever find a parking space here. You can park around the corner in the neighborhood or across the street at the antique shop. If you plan to eat here on your lunch break from work good luck to you. You're better off getting take out.

I stick to the sweet and sour chicken. I usually order with extra vegetables and light sauce (the sauce is a bit intense). I also get the edamame. Seriously, I miss the crab wontons more than I miss bread. They JUST started offering #glutenfree soy sauce (tamari) packets! HOORAY PEI WEI!   BUT this restaurant gets a 3-star review (honestly a 3.5) because of the AWFUL PARKING LOT. Add 10 minutes to your destination to drive around the small parking lot if you want a close spot - OR - park in the SE corner behind the antique mall and walk over. Also, the patio is great to sit at, but there's a big pigeon problem. They'll attack your food if you let them!  I always get to-go here and it's usually pretty decent. Today they a) gave me the wrong meal in my to-go bag and I had to call and ask them to come out and exchange my meal. However, when I got back and opened up the to-go container, they had forgotten the extra vegetables I requested. MAKE SURE you check what you're getting to-go, especially if you are #glutenfree!",

    "text": "It is what it is.  I like this Pei Wei (WARNING) just do not come here between 1115am-1230pm unless you want to wait for the business crowd.  Its  a favorite location due to being so close to starbucks and right off of 7th ave.  Parking is terrible during these hours also.  If you do want to come here for lunch during your work day I would suggest try getting here at 11am at least you wont have to wait long.  I usually call in and go pick it up if I cant make the 11am window.    The food is good.  As good as pei wei gets.  Its always fresh and the taste and texture is what I would expect.  My favorite is probably the curry chicken.  I ask for extra spicy.  The pot stickers are awesome too they are deep fried though.  They have this chilli sauce by the soda fountain that is killer.  I love it.    Overall I would say not a family friendly place during lunch hours but anytime after the lunch rush is good.  Get your Pei Wei on.",

    "text": "I haven't been to this location before, but I didn't think twice before placing my Pick-Up order because of all the great experiences and food I've had at other locations. Yikes -- it did NOT turn out as I expected!! I ordered two Vietnamese chicken rolls and 1/2 order of sushi rolls (it had mango in it, but I can't remember the name for some reason). This location doesn't take online orders, and the wait time on the phone was about 15 minutes. My order was ready for pick-up on time (but warning, parking is hard around the lunch hour). I grabbed my bag of food, headed back to the office, and was surprised when I opened the box of Vietnamese rolls.  One of the rolls was split down the middle and falling apart. Bummer. I used a fork to eat it, and opaque liquid dripped off the pieces that I forked up. Gross. I then noticed that, instead of peanut sauce, they gave me sesame ginger vinaigrette that is meant for a salad (I think). What!? The second roll was falling apart from excessive liquid, too. But, what was worse, was the FISHY taste when I bit into it. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE CHICKEN! I dug through the roll to find that it was made with what appeared to be a white fish. It flaked like fish, looked like fish, and tasted like fish. Dear G-d, I hope it was fish.  Now I'm totally grossed out and will NOT eat from this location again.  I gave this review two stars instead of one because I think every place deserves a second chance (sometimes crap happens).... I just can't get this fishy taste out of my mouth, and I'm too freaked out to eat there again.",

I had the Japanese ramen plate on my most recent visit and it satisfied my hunger, but I would definitely not be inclined to order it again if return. I suppose the appeal of this place to many could be that it is simply accessible in the sense that it's a comfortable establishment and not one that you might be hesitant about entering. So go ahead, try it out and then go find some good Asian food the next time you're in the mood.",

    "text": "Pei-Wei used to be my \"go to\" for quick and simple Asian-inspired foods, if I don't feel like driving to Great Wall or New Gardens.  Stopped in on a Sunday for Pad Thai and decided to try the cauliflower rice. Chef accidentally made regular rice but corrected the order and gave me the regular rice dish for free. Free food is always a plus, right? Nope.  Both the tofu cauliflower rice and chicken fried rice were tasteless bowls of nothing! Ordinarily, when the food's not up to par,  I'd heat up a skillet, add sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic and hot chili oil and recook the dish. But it's Sunday after church. I'm not recooking anything! I promise you, had my sister persuaded me otherwise, that food was being tossed in the garbage and not take up space in my fridge.  What about the Pad Thai Obese? Surely that was better? N O P E! I was so disgusted with everything. I should have taken that mess back then drive down the street to Jack In The Box and order four tacos, a large peach tea, driven home and binge watched Archer.  Needless to say, I won't be returning to Pei-Wei anytime this year. I personally cannot afford to pay for tasteless food that I have to recook. I'll keep my money with me and spend it where I know I'll receive value for my money.",

Having the ability to get these and stay Keto friendly at the same time is amazing. It has been a few months since being here and I forgot or didn't realize how pricey they have become. Certainly not an expensive option. If your looking for good food cheap this is not the place. If your looking for quality food, made fresh and willing to pay for that, then this is your place.",

Their radio ads had put orange chicken on my mind and I did not find it wanting. Nicely sweet & tart with a little heat, but not as syrupy sweet as most. Accompanying brown rice was perfectly cooked, and the lunchtime cost was under $10. Good service  despite crowd. Not unpleasant environment. Quite satisfying meal at good price.

The register service was quick, the employee was patient explaining how the menu worked for the two of us who had never been to one before, and our food came to our table quickly. As with any quick-service restaurant, you don't go there because you expect fine dining level quality; you go there because you want consistent, fast, inexpensive food.  In that regard, we were not disappointed.  All of us were please with the speed of service and the freshness of our food. Given a similar need for fast, fresh food I would definitely try this location or another in the chain.",

The chicken lettuce wraps were good, but the pad Thai was way too spicy for my liking. I've had the chicken pad Thai dozens of time from Pei Wei, and it has never been that spicy. When I told the ladies up front about it, they looked so annoyed and acted like I was wrong and dumb for even saying that. They came over and told us that the sauce is pre-made and always tastes that way so there was nothing they could do about it, when I know for a fact it doesn't ever taste like that. They offered to get us a side of rice or something but it didn't seem like they really meant it so we declined. If I go to Pei Wei again, I'll definitely go to a different one. Also, the soda machines were out of every flavor I wanted, they should work on changing things when they run out.",

The teriyaki chicken was also overcooked, totally dried out and without any sauce on the meat or veggies.  To top off the insult, only 2 fortune cookies came with our order of 4 entrees, is the economy so bad we are sharing fortune cookies now?",

    "text": "Like it's big brother PF Chang's, Pei Wei really isn't anything special. I'm always perplexed by the way a lot people rave about it.  I eat at this location once in a great while because it's very close to work. I can order food online, and the amount of time it takes to get to my car and drive over is exacly the time it's supposed to be ready. But the truth about all these chain Asian places is that pretty much every meal tastes similar, and nothing is all that great. Overall, it feels like a slightly higher quality version of fast food.   I ordered the Orange Peel Chicken. It has a little bit of a kick from chili peppers, but to label it as \"spicy\" on the menu is a joke. The sauce was okay, but like I said earlier, nothing spectacular. Like most chains, it kind of has that \"out of box\" taste.   I'll give Pei Wei credit for good prices and portion sizes. I also love that brown rice is an option. The online ordering is also convenient and easy. The people who work at the take out counter are quick and friendly (although they never put napkins in the bag unless you ask, that should be standard). Pei Wei is the definition of A-OK, but if I'm looking for more than a quick meal, there's too many good local Asian restaurants that are worth checking out first.",

They are efficient and friendly.  The food is always prepared well.  You THINK a chopped chicken salad is the same here as at other Pei Wei's?  NOT SO, my friend!   THIS one knows just how long to poach it, debone and deskin it, and the proper dice.  It is always a sublime salad experience.  Whatever your favorite PeiWei dish is, it will be prepared better at this location.

The parking lot is completely too small for the volume of lunch and dinner business they generate. It's in a bad part of Phoenix, so I don't recommend parking down one of the neighborhood streets. However, if you need a Phoenix cop, this place is swarming with them like flies. One day I counted (5) patrol units in the parking lot.  The food is good however, and they are amenable to changing menu items to suit your palate. Though a bit overpriced for what is essentially \"fast food\" it's still tastes better than other Chinese take-out joints.",

Everything I have tried on the menu is just great. Really love their Thai Chicken and their Thai Coconut Curry ... my fave main dishes.  All 3 salads are great, and the Chopped Chicken Salad is actually way healthy when I'm watching my diet.  They just came out with some small plates; my man tried the chicken lemongrass salad small plate last night and it was really awesome.  They have a good test kitchen to come up with this stuff.

I walked in and I saw they served sushi so I thought I'd try it. God no. It tasted worse than the frys brand with that imitation crab. I sent it back and asked for a side of chicken, the manager looked annoyed but took it back anyway. A few minutes after receiving my chicken, I dropped a drink accidentally. My fault, yes, but when I went to ask the server for a towel, he actually gave me one and made me clean the table up myself. I then went to ask for a second one because the floor was still wet, which is when another employee stepped in and starting cleaning it. I then went to ask for boxes for our food because that visit was pretty horrible. Instead of going to get my boxes, the kid that made me clean up the drink went to tell the \"manager\" I spilled a drink and she threw her hands up in the air as if the world had ended. I'm sure this isn't the first or last time someone spills a drink lady. Learn some customer service skills. So I sat there, and waited and waited and waited for my boxes. I stopped him and asked him where my boxes were, \"oh sorry I forgot.\" Maybe you wouldn't have forgotten if you weren't busy gossiping. So in conclusion, the sushi is disgusting, like I literally had to spit it out after trying to force myself to eat it and the service was horrible. The manager should rethink customer service at a restaurant with her attitude.",

Chinese food is supposed to be greasy, but there's often something a little off about Pei Wei.   So why the 3 stars? Because they have the most incredible, firm, flavorful tofu ever. It's not a nice dark skin around it and it takes on the flavor of their oh-so-sodium-filled sauces without becoming a soggy mess. It really is tofu perfection.   I also appreciate their awesome to-go options (order online or on your mobile browser) and the fact that they notate on their menu (with a leaf) which options are vegetarian.   This place isn't the best Chinese ever, but I think it's decent if you're looking for something fast and very vegetarian-friendly.",

    "text": "Perhaps you know that guy who likes to talk in \"quotes\". Well, he would definitely be at home at Pei Wei, and especially at this location.  Set in Phoenix's \"historic district\" Pei Wei is supposed to represent a sign of \"urban renewal\" for the city's core. It's wedged on a very small parcel of land at the southwest corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue. As alluded to it's \"parking lot\" causes one to draw lots...because there's no guarantee of finding a space if you fancy eating a meal other than breakfast or dinner here. Nevertheless, the restaurant's architecture embodies a bit more \"character\" than one might be used to Arizona. Free-standing, it favors a \"sophisticated\" and \"historic\" look with brick-lined interiors.    Inevitably, there will be a prodigious line awaiting you (and your money). This is actually a benefit to you trying to read the \"menu' posted on boards along the entry-way. The selections are all \"Asian fusion\" which defies description probably as much as the term \"electability\". Don't be fooled, there is little or no guarantee that any person of Asian descent got within miles of providing any contribution to your meal. Nevertheless, the food has been carefully calibrated to appeal to the \"fast casual\" palette.   And adhering to the mantra of \"fast casual\", you'll find all the service quality of Souplantation. You order your food, you take your number, they give you a table, they drop off your food and they take away your tray. This \"forward-looking\" and \"innovative\" human resource strategy doesn't seem to solve the wait for your food, but it probably does keep costs down.  The spectre of \"gentrification\" tends to raise prices...but in this regard Pei Wei still appeals to the rapidly disappearing \"middle class\". It's not possible to match the \"value\" of say In-N-Out here, but you can eat for under $10 easily. And even though the company has lost the role of culinary \"vanguard\" to say, Pinkberry, it's still one of the better options for lunch in the shadow of downtown.",

I spend less on take out here than if I go to China Chili, and the portions are about the same. They also give me the option of having brown rice which is great.   Their mongolian beef I'm quite sure is filled with meth or crack or something. It's a very addicting flavor, and helps to make sure you get your years worth of sodium that day.",

Slicing into my delicate palate is typically a cherished experience that lasts for days as I run my tongue over the loose flaps of skin left behind by the sharp edges of over-toasted sandwich bread; today my adoration for mouth injuries seems to be on a hiatus.  My fickle love affair with Pei Wei ended the moment I discovered they discontinued the green coconut curry dish, however, I do occasionally break down for some tofu Pad Thai and the occasional crab won ton.  The location on 7th Ave and McDowell is conveniently located and has become a place where I make emergency dining decisions.   A mere month ago a friend of mine and I dined in for a business meeting and the service was so horrible and inconsistent with the menu description that the manager, Anthony, gave us a $10 gift card credit to use the next time we came in in addition to a comp of the dish in question.  I appreciate that the management was willing to save a couple of potential repeat customers, kudos for that.  Anthony, if you are still managing this location; please stop doing so many lines of cocaine during your break. Perhaps drinking on the job and soliciting young, impressionable cashiers is not the best use of your time.   Whatever it is that you are doing Mr. or Ms. manager of Pei Wei Downtown Phoenix, please stop it at once and focus on the piss poor quality of food that you are cranking out on the regular.   My Pad Thai was soggy, overcooked and flavorless. Unless they have recently updated their recipes, I would wager to say that this was sent back by an in-house patron and re-heated for my enjoyment.  The potstickers were blackened around the edges and cooked to the point where the insides had shriveled to the size of a nickel.    No matter how hungry I get, I will never in all of my days spend another dime in this establishment.  Kthxbai xo",

    "text": "This chain is a joke and I've given it too chances to redeem itself. I'll get to the worst part (the food) later because I'd like to mention something very odd about this chain first. I've been to different locations and only in one were the employees friendly - all other times I've encountered extremely sour faced and sometimes downright rude employees. Almost always! I just thought it was coincidence the first 2 times, but no. It's very strange. Now with that out of the way, I'll get to why I will never ever go here again unless every other restaurant within a 50 mile radius from me gets wiped out for some reason and I have no choice: the food here is usually (but not always) absolutely dreadful. The noodle dishes are usually more tolerable than the rice dishes. However, just about every dish you order here, whether it's supposed to be Thai or Japanese or Korean, use the same generic sweet & sour type of sauce. If you're not into sweet food, you're out of luck here. I boycotted this place for 6 months until today (see my previous Pei Wei review). Today I ordered a new rice dish called Supergreen Thai Green Curry described as \"Wok-seared carrots, green beans, Swiss chard, onions, garlic, ginger and lemongrass, tossed with Thai coconut green curry sauce and garnished with Thai basil, scallions, cilantro and a lime wedge.\" Doesn't that sound delightful?! I was starving by the time it arrived 20-25 minutes later. I should note service today was also particularly slow. Even bland food should taste good when you're starving, right? Not in this case. I'm wondering how much more awful it must have been in reality if I wasn't so famished.... So on my table arrived a big mound of stale looking sticky white rice with cubes of chicken and this strange liquid closest in look and texture to clam chowder soup splattered on top of everything. My first thought before eating was \"Hey some of the best dishes are the least pretty\" so I went ahead expecting flavors of curry and basil and took a bite. What?! I thought surely this can't be, so I went ahead and took a second bite hoping my taste buds didn't correctly register the first bite. The taste of the green curry (a.k.a. clam chowder goop) was basically that of \"sugar water\". They didn't even get the color right! At least put a drop of green food coloring in thick sweet clam chowder stew! There was nothing green, let alone \"supergreen\" nor curry nor ginger nor coconut nor basil nor cilantro nor lime about it. I immediately told them this and asked for a refund. The 1 star is for them being understanding enough to refund me for the time wasted and being subjected to this mystery dish I was unfortunate enough to experience on this Easter Sunday. Otherwise zero stars is warranted. Probably my worst dining experience ever.",

I've only been to Pei Wei once and that was years ago. The order process is already kinda weird so when I was ready to order, the girl asked me if I was dining in or ordering to go.  I said to go and she says \"well this is the dine in line but it's ok\"...did she really need to tell me? There was no one else in the line so I wasn't holding anyone up AND she worked both lines so what the hell does it matter?    The food from a scale to 1 to 10 was a 0.  I've never ate food with no taste.  The chicken was dry, the noodles had absolutely no seasoning.  There was only so much soy sauce I could put, I mean I had to salvage the one pack that they gave me. Cheapness.  If I wanted noodles with no taste, I could have boiled my own for free.  Lesson learned.  You guys will never get my business again!",

    "text": "Third time at this location.  Only one time was good, and that was when we actually ate there.   No problems then.  But the other two times, my co-worker and I picked-up our lunch.  Today, the Ice Tea was empty - so my co-worker asked the lady (who seemed to be the Supervisor today) if there was anymore tea.  The lady said she'd fill it up, but first, she just HAD TO fill-up her own large soda.  I then noticed that BOTH machines were out of Coke, so I mentioned to her, as well.  She only replied, \"Then they're both out\".  That was it.  I then told my co-worker I was going to get a refund (Dr Pepper was also out) on my drink - this woman heard me.  So, I go to pick-up my To Go order, but no one is there to help ALL the people standing around waiting for their orders, as well.  So, I go to the main cashier guy and tell him I want a refund because there is no more Coke.  During this time, the same woman is now standing in the Pick Up area and talking to two women while a man is MAD about his order not being complete (after getting home with it).  Another woman is arguing with the man.  Both women finally agree to refund the guy's order.  FINALLY, the cashier guy helping me is now back with one of the women.  Apparently he can't do refunds.  Then, she can't do a refund either.  All this time, the Supervisor woman is still standing over there talking to the same two women - KNOWING I wanted to get a refund.  She finally comes over and refunds my two bucks, 10 minutes later.  And then tries to give me a NEW RECEIPT.  For what?  LoL.   So, my co-worker and I return to work with our takeout orders...  Her rice is not even cooked enough, STILL CRUNCHY!  The veggies in BOTH our dishes weren't cooked, as well.  And my noodles are DRY - thank goodness for the SOY SAUCE.   Guess I should've taken that new receipt!  LoL.   This place could be soooo much better.   We won't be going here for lunch again.",

It was pretty disgusting. Then when I got my food, I found what appeared to be a SHARD OF GLASS in the salt for my edamame. I brought it to the attention of the woman taking orders in the front. She assured me she would speak to the manager about it. I sat back down and finished my meal and absolutely nobody came to speak to me about it. So I'm assuming you're just cool with glass in your food? Lastly, I had stacked my dishes and had just finished popping my edamame onto the top most plate when a server came by and snatched my plate away. Sure, my plates were stacked and one might make a reasonable assumption that I was finished, except that I had my chopsticks in my hand and was actively eating off the plate. He didn't even look back to see my face filed with disappointment.   Sure, I could have yelled and made a big fuss, but I'm not that type of person. This was a tasty, but really disappointing meal.",

    "text": "This restaurant is so deserving of the average 3 stars because of your highly dissatisfying meal and slow, understaffed service. Let me explain:  1. I came in and it took several minutes to get a cashier to get my order. He was okay. My feelings aren't hurt, but this shouldn't be the case since it was a slow Wednesday afternoon with a handful of people. 2. I chose Pad Thai with the veggie+tofu option. The taste barely resembled Pad Thai and the flavor of the entire meal was bland yet strangely sour due to the sauce, especially since it basically drowned in it. I didn't even squeeze the lime. I could barely tell there were other flavors, which is a pity. I thought I tasted cilantro in there, but I'm not so sure now. 3. Overall, it was so filling but unsatisfying.   Here are some suggestions to improve your quality:  1. LESS SAUCE. I cannot emphasize that enough. Western Asian food chains always seem to do this. Maybe add more crushed peanuts or peanut butter (is that even allowed?). 2. Taste a sample of your cooking, please. If it tastes strange to you, then it's pretty gross in big quantities.  3. Try chopping vegetables at home more often. It's cute some of your veggies were cut unevenly but I couldn't fit some pieces in my mouth aka the broccoli.   Then again, this is a food chain so what else do I expect. If you want Westernized Pad Thai or Westernized Asian food in general, this is the place to go.",

I was never a fan of Pei Wei in Tucson but decided to give this location a shot since I had a coupon for a free meal. I got a cup of the Thai wonton soup, which was fairly tasty but for 1.99 it looked like enough to fill maybe a tea cup. For an entree I tried the spicy Korean with shrimp and white rice. The whole meal was basically a flavorless morass. Two stars for good customer service and fortune cookies but would not go back on my own.",

    "text": "I don't know what's going on with the management of this location, but it seems to be going downhill quickly.  We stopped in last night for what should have been a quick bite on our way to the theater. However, what would have been a quick bite turned into a long time waiting for our food. And it wasn't just us, everyone around us was commenting on how long it was taking for food to come out of the kitchen. Now, since it's open, I could that there were plenty of people back there so I'm not sure why it took so long, but it certainly did.  Now, if you're going to compete in the fast, casual, restaurant market, you need to nail the fast part. When this Pei Wei was new, maybe they could get away with it, seeing as the only nearby competition was the (now gone) My Florist Cafe, but now that there is a Habit Burger, Chipotle, Pot Belly Sandwiches, and On a Roll within walking distance the management of Pei Wei need to get their act together.   Also, the last time we were at this location, they completely screwed up our order and brought us the wrong dishes.  Get it together Pei Wei!",

Cooks were looking at us right when we walked in and talking to the others around them and laughing as if we did something hilarious . I did not like this at all. It made my friend and I feel uncomfortable and you can tell that they were looking right at us because no one else was around nearby. I find this really disrespectful. Peiwei needs to hire more mature people in the kitchen. I will never ever come here again . I rather take my money else where.",

The first time I tried it the rice was too sweet and I figured if they can mess up the rice, I don't want to come back. The guy was semi helpful when I explained the situation. He did laugh in an asshole way when I asked if our orders came with drinks. Maybe he missed the part about it being YEARS since I've been. My husband ordered the Mongolian steak with noodles and he enjoyed his meal. I had the terakyi chicken with white rice. I enjoyed my meal but wouldn't go out of my way for it. If you get what I ordered ask for no onion.",

There were no customers in line so I thought that my food was ready. It wasn't ready...or they must've given it to someone else because there were no to-go orders set aside. The girls starting looking through the orders and asked the 2 guys to make my order. When I got home, it was a chicken lettuce wrap WITH ONIONS and SCALLIONS. Not even the right order!",
