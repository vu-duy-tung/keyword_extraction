Our server kept rushing us to order,  when ordering we couldn't even say what we wanted without him trying to take the next persons order . Asked him 3 times for a box and was told he couldn't do separate checks . When asked if he could itemized our check cause we couldn't read his handwriting,  he said he would give us a menu to figure it out . Very unprofessional in my opinion.",

Saturday night place was packed, 7:15pm, 20 minute wait we where told after waiting 5-10 minutes probably too 25-30 instead of 20 but the where slammed!!!  Got our table place is packed little loud but not too bad. We where read to order when we sat down waiter came a few minutes later dropped off chips placed the orders  and he was gone --- never saw him till we got food never did get to place a drink order  Food was great came got our plates and again gone waited 30 minutes finally I had to go find someone to get the bill   I'm posting this review hoping management may see it  You can turn tables quicker if you get people their bill soon after picking up empty plates --- customers can get seated sooner  You can get more $$ from your customers if the waiter take the time to let you order drinks  Foods great staff friendly eager to help if you can find them, maybe it was just one of those nights?",

    "text": "As someone who no longer lives in New Mexico but still considers herself a New Mexican at heart, I crave New Mexican food on a regular basis. So, when I come  to Phoenix, I must have a New Mexican food fix!  Several visits ago my sister took me to Los Dos Molinos and we found it fits the bill as well as any displaced New Mexican could ask.   Today we ate at the Camelback location for the first time. The building is a cute Adobe with an inviting entry. Inside, the decor is colorful with many New Mexico themed paintings. We arrived right at lunch time, yet were greeted and seated immediately by Jorge, who ended up being our server. The service was efficient and friendly throughout our meal.   Now for the food.  How do I describe the taste of heaven? We started off with the spicy nacho cheese (a special) to accompany our freshly fried chips: wonderful flavor at a spice level that had heat but was not overdone. For my entree I ordered a machaca-filled chimichanga with green sauce. Machaca at Los Dos is like no other I have had. It is their delicious shredded beef tossed in their equally delicious spicy red sauce. The combination of flavors was delectable and, to my surprise, just spicy enough to keep things interesting.  My sister had a green corn tamale that was also amazing.  The beans and rice were pretty standard fare, but also good, and provided a welcome break from the heat, as did the side of sour cream and guacamole that came with the chimi.  Needless to say, I am already planning my next visit to my sister and nephew.  It's the family I am coming back for,  right?",

    "text": "Pros: Green Chili, Adovada, New Mexican, margaritas, salsa, bar seating.  Cons: Flex service can slow when busy, inconsistent hours/open times.  Los Dos is a great spot for spicy New Mexican food.  Keep in mind that New Mexican is different than Mexican - spicy with green chili either highlighting or supporting many dishes.  The flavor profile is similar, but not the same, which seems to throw off some of the reviews for this spot.  The food is excellent, and certainly representative of New Mexico.  Parking is pretty easy to negotiate, located behind the building via a narrow drive to the east side of the building.    When its really busy, service can be patchy - it seems they operate with minimal front staff.  You'll likely have different servers and runners stopping by throughout the course of your meal to check on you, if you need something, flag any of them instead of waiting for the person that took your order.  I doubt they assign specific servers to specific sections.  Also, I drove there several days after a holiday and they were closed, which was pretty annoying.  Their hours have been inconsistent for me in the past, sometimes closing early, or not open, and so on.  Overall, the food is excellent and a must-try in the area.  The food gets 5 stars.  The restaurant may be closed when you stop by, and the service may go either way, but its still worth a try.",

The South Mountain location is better (because the kitsch factor is higher, and they *really* don't hold back on the heat there... or the booze), but this is still a home run.  I'v eaten here more times than I can count. If you're not into spice, there are a few things on the menu, but you're missing the magical dishes and I'd recommend going somewhere a bit more... mild. As someone who has an unhealthy love for spicy... It's adovada at its apex. Terrific tamales. Salsa that leaves you longing for its bite. Love.  And the margaritas and sangria are deadly strong. If you care about such things.",

    "text": "Awesome New Mexico type Mexican food. I've been here at least a gross times!!!  Mom's original spicy pork stew is what I always seem to get, although everything on the menu is very good, its got huge chucks of potatoes, huge pork chunks, delicious pork based stew and has a spicy kick.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu... but 1 blue corn tamale and the stew with a side order of tortillas always seem to be my goto order.  The stew is a 9/10, but I warn you... the heat level can be hot! (Not quite habanero level, but close and it can vary with the seasons)  The margaritas on the rocks are always heavy, but delicious. Watch out! Not as popular, but very sweet tasting, are their frozen margarita.... but despite being extra sweet and like a slushie... it packs a hidden punch....Dont be surprised if only two of these gets you buzzed...I warned you!   The enchiladas are great, most meals (but not the stew) come with the typical Mexican rice and beans, and the typical stuff.  Tacos are big, good, and extra tortillas are soft, fluffy and warm.  Chips and salsas are good, you can tell it was made that day, they have both a red and a green, but we always argue which is hotter, so try both.  And lastly, the sopapillas are delicious for desert with the honey!",

Between their delicious food, incredible service, and great atmosphere, Los Dos is a must visit restaurant in Phoenix!",

I also ordered some chorizo and nacho cheese dip as an appetizer.  When the chorizo nacho cheese dip came, it was so incredibly hot that I was unable to even suffer through more than a couple of bites of it. I mean, it was more spicy than their salsa (which is saying something). This is coming from someone who usually puts about three fire sauce packets on his tacos. It was ridiculously hot.  The garlic pork roast was pretty good, though!  Side note: They apparently have a warning on the menu that states you can't return items that are too hot. I did not realize this when I ordered the chorizo nacho cheese dip, so the manager made a one time exception and gave me a refund. Normally they don't give refunds for spicy food, though, so make sure that you can handle very spicy stuff before ordering!",

I was warned the food is very hot and spicy and it was but not unbearable. I tried their signature dish adovada ribs based on a recommendation from our driver. When they came out I was surprised their was no bone and then u realized they are country style ribs so they don't come on the bone. This made it easier to eat. The meat was very tender. The sauce was spicy but flavorful. It came with a fresh hot tortilla.   The place is pretty popular and the inside was packed when we arrived. We didn't want to wait a long time for seating so we opted for outdoor seating. It was cold that night so they put us near s flamed heater however the fire burned out and they could not relight it so that was a let down. The servers were nice. Overall a decent experience.",

Can I just say that finally I have found amazing, hot salsa...finally! We mixed the red and green salsas together, try it you will love it. I also got a margarita which was yummy and strong. We ordered the chicken burrito and I ordered the number 3 combo but I didnt want a beef taco, I would rather have chicken. The server told me that they don't do substitutions but she would ask, I said no big deal, if they will do it then cool, if not then just order everything separate and put it on the same plate.  The server came back and announced that they would do the substitution. Awesome!  The food was good. Im not a fan of their beans but I was born and raised in new Mexico so I'm a little bit picky lol.  All in all this is the best place I've been to in several months.

We were seated up front near the bar area by the guy I assumed was the owner/manager/full time bull-ish-er who spent the entire time visiting with a couple at the bar. My boyfriend asked for a soda and waters as we were being seated. The busser brought water,chips and salsa immediately and that was the last bit of 'good' service we received.  It took the waiter forever to come to our table just to take the order or even acknowledge we were there, again asked for soda. It took quite a bit of time for the soda to finally make an appearance at which point the food was delivered.  During our meal we tried flagging down the waiter 3 times to ask for drink refills. At one point he looked directly at us, nodded, and proceeded to forget about us.  After several attempts to flag him down I physically started waving my hands in the air as if I was stranded on an island waiting for a rescue but still not one single waiter/busser or captain BS at the bar seemed to notice or care. (and yes Mr. Bartender sir I DID in fact see that you saw and did nothing to alert the staff)  I understand talking to customers is part of the business but it shouldn't be at the expense of others.  I'll even give you that it was their opening week however there's no excuse for blatantly ignoring clients sitting 2 feet from you while you do nothing but chat it up with the cute lady at the bar.  Not once did the waiter come to ask how we were or to check on us. The place wasn't that busy but even if it were the guy at the bar could've, you know, just peeked his head up to see how everyone was doing. The food is good but not good enough to make me come back. And what's up with the horrendous decor. We had to eat in the corner with a marble bust of Geronimo giving us the evil eye!",

As you can imagine, the Southwestern/Mexican food anywhere in Oklahoma is... how do I put it? Best not eaten. So I gorged myself on Mexican while in town. I stopped in at Los Dos Molinos for lunch and the atmosphere alone made me feel more comfortable. They brought me the staple tortilla chips and salsa. I don't know that I can actually call it salsa though... it was more like an art: a palatable aesthetic. I had a problem here, in that I had so many restaurants to hit up while in town and only so much room in my stomach. Sadly, that meant I needed something to satiate my appetite and craving, so I opted for a simple bean burrito. It had a good blend of seasoning, plus a nice mix of refried and whole pinto beans. I ended up using all the salsa by dousing my burrito with it. The only downside to the place is the tight parking behind the restaurant, but all in all it was a great experience.",

When I first walked in I was taken back by all the lights and carefully hung snowflakes (it was December) but it looked beautiful and set a very nice atmostphere to be in. The food was pretty good, not the most authentic mexican food I've had but there were no complaints about it. The same head bus boy from when I worked was still there giving attentive service as always! Over all still a really great place to go for dinner if youre in the area or want to try something new. I only wish that the owner would give in and start having live music every Friday night as Padres did. It makes for a nice edge and always drew tons of people in and of course was always a blast.",

I ordered the relleno and it was the first place i've ever had one that wasn't fried.  It was just the stuffed chilli wrapped in an omlette style egg.  ok, that was a new one. Not bad, but i'll take the crispy fried one.  The overall taste of food was good and i would go back again just because they serve green chile.  But overall, not very impressive.    Ever since the Albuquerque Tortilla Factory and Hatch Valley Chile Company went under, it's been a struggle to find good New Mexican food in AZ.",

Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving...",

The salsa was the spiciest sales we have had at a restaurant. It was vey good and flavorful.  We also ordered guac. It was so tasty. I loved every bite of it. My husband asked the waiter what the spiciest dish was and he recommended adovado enchiladas. I got red chile cheese enchiladas. I was so scared they were going to be spicy so I ordered sour cream as a chaser. I also ordered a house margarita. The baby got a side of beans for her second dinner.  The food was very good. It had nice flavor and was very tasty. It didn't live up to the spicy hype. I had no problems eating mine. I didn't even need water. It was still good but I was on a spicy mission and wanted my husband to sweat. He still enjoyed his meal and said he would go back. Maybe we went on an off spicy night? Not sure but our search continues for spicy food...  Overall good food, decent service, tasty chips (I wish they were endless though)",

Spicy is an understatement. I like spicy food, but you can take a crappy burrito and add original spicy salsa to it and it could taste decent. But why do this to amazingly thoughtful Mexican food? I think thy should take it down a notch so you can truly enjoy the quality of the tastes that they have masked in their tender meats and marinades. I would have given it 5 stars with the ambiance and grub but, unfortunately 3 for now. Ps service is great. Love that there are all different ages doing there too.",

Their service is sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes a bit below average. Service isn't their strongest suit but since I go for the hot, spicy food, I consistently forgive their occasional inattentiveness:-)",

It's not for everyone granted its really not for kids, families, or gringo girls and chicken tacos, it's for red chile sauceophiles and pork.

    "text": "Um, yeah, \"meh\" says it best... it's a step up from saying worse things I suppose!  4-star food, 1-star service, VERY limited & pricey menu.  I ordered a combo platter, a taco, cheese enchilada, rice & beans: $12-bucks.  Their salsa's were really good, and the meal was fairly good but certainly overpriced for what you get.  Most the meals are around $15-bucks, which there's maybe 8 selections of them.    Going solo isn't my favorite way to go, but today I'd decided to try them out seeing they recently opened and are down the street from where I live.  I felt like a damned ghost in there, while there were quite a few people eating there -- it took a long while for the waiter to take my order, it came pretty quickly but that was the last time I came in contact with any of the staff.  I had to flag down the seater, twice, to get him to turn the fan on; it was over 96 outside and not much cooler where I was seated.  Not once was I asked how my order was, or if I needed anything - I had to flag down the waiter covering a nearby table in order to get my check.  I'd finished 10 minutes earlier, but no one seemed to notice, much less give a damn.  I can't remember the last time I left a 10% tip, but I did today, and don't feel the least bit bad because if the 'service' was any worse I'd have left a penny.  Like I said, the food was pretty good, and from what I saw others get, their dishes looked good too.  Yet for the kinds of prices they ask, all I can say is they're not worth writing home about, and I have no plans on ever going back.  There's just too many great, inexpensive Mexican places around so there's absolutely nothing that separates them from any other S'western/Mexican food establishment.  Maybe if you're with a group of friends and want to get trashed on Margaritas and blow a bunch of money on some okay food, it'd be a different story as long as you know what kind of 'hook' you're going to get put on once the tab rolls around!",

    "text": "Had heard many good things about this place and finally visited for lunch yesterday. I came in with low expectations which were met with patio furniture from Pick Up Stix which went bust awhile ago. That made me giggle. The decor is definitely hodge-podgetastic.   We were greeted and seated in the main dining room. It wasn't very crowded and our waiter was right on top of us. The red and green salsas that came with the chips were fantastic, and the chips were warm but not sure if they were super fresh. Still, I had no problem mowing them down. I ordered a fresh margarita and it was huge, delicious and fresh. Very good marg! One was plenty, they don't skimp on the booze! I went with the Adovada Enchilada dinner because i was told that this was the thing to get. I ordered it Christmas style which I learned meant red and green sauce. This was a very good dish. Its not the traditional enchilada in the sense that the meat was wrapped up. The chunky and flavorful pork was ladled on top of this maybe 1/2 inch thick tortilla cake...for lack of a better word. Covered with red and green sauce and a sexy little fried egg. I will take an egg on pretty much anything. I ate the entire enchilada and a bit of the rice and beans. Next time I would skip the rice and beans and just order ala carte. We had a group of 6 and they added 18% gratuity to our bill.  Solid spot, i will be back with the hubs in tow.",

    "text": "My husband and sister-in-law are from New Mexico, so we wanted to try this place out. We had heard good things.  The chips were okay. Nothing fresh or extraordinary. The salsas packed a punch, as promised, and were quite fresh. The New Mexicans approved heartily.  The menu doesn't offer much in the way of healthy choices, so I went for the chicken taco salad. The item I received was quite literally that. It was a large platter with a very lonesome deep-fried shell with salad inside. It wasn't much bigger than a standard taco but cost $10. The shredded chicken on top was quite good, but I was really disappointed at the severe lack of... salad. There was very little iceberg lettuce there, and underneath that were beans that completely soaked through the bottom of the shell as well. To one side, a large tortilla chip had a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole. The guac was completely smooth and had no flavor at all. Since most of the menu boasts of a high heat level, it's like their non-hot items went to a bland extreme. I was pretty disappointed.  My husband and sister-in-law liked their enchiladas, though, and said the sauces added a lot of flavor and the meat was well done. My husband didn't like that the only side options were beans and rice.   I would advise going elsewhere to use the bathroom, too. The ladies' room was extremely cramped. This is the first time I've had to say this in a Yelp review, but... the toilet paper was not good.   So, the red and green sauces and the meats were well done, but we were not enthused by our experience. We wouldn't visit again.",

Food is amazing. Chips and salsa to tart you off right. The red salsa is hot. I was sweating after one bite and my tongue was tingling for quite awhile after. The green salsa isn't as bad but still has a bit of kick. Tacos, tortas, flautas, burritos, and smothered and covered enchiladas line the menu with beans and rice. The flavor of the food is great and the spice stays on your tongue long after you're done eating. The fresh margarita is sooo delicious and comes in a big rectangle cup loaded with tequila. Service is pretty prompt as well even when it gets busy. I like how they leave the water pitcher at your table so you can refill as needed. Arizona is full of Mexican food, but Los Dos definitely ranks among the top.",

I got the #5 combo, which was a flour tortilla filled with seasoned beef (not ground, more like roast) covered in their green sauce.  Really enjoyed the entree and salsas. The surprise was the beans. These are like the pintos my mom used to make. She's still with us, but has modified her recipe for a more healthy version over the last few years. The rice was great too. You could see and taste the Browning in the skillet.  Tried out their Kickass Margarita on the rocks. Tasty and effective!  Highly recommended if you are in the area.",

The Guacamole was pathetic Tex- mex at best, and we aren't sure what the enchiladas were made with but nothing that looked like blue corn tortillas. The sopapillas were too thin and greasy. Perhaps over the years the food has moved to more Mexican than True New Mexican - and there IS a difference !The margaritas however were very good . Service was fair to poor, nothing more than one would expect in a fast food place. If you are truly looking for New Mexican cooking , go to Richardson's or Blue Corn Grill.",

I have been to the location down on Central & Baseline YEARS ago but with this new location opening about a year ago, I was excited to try it again.  I am so bummed that I didn't try it sooner.  It ended up on our \"list of places to go before we move\" and now I wish that we had been going here more often.   We walk in, the atmospher is really charming.  It's set up kind of like a \"cantina\" maybe?  Clean, nicely decorated and just a charming resturant overall.  They have a bar area you can sit in or they also have some dinning rooms off the bar and then some additional seating outside.  It was a bit warm out still so we opted for inside.     First round comes the chips & salsa.  You get Hot & Hotter.  If you're sensitive to spicy food, this might not be the place for you.   That being siad, their salsas are so flavorful and I crave it just as I am writing this!   Our server was really friendly and noticably attentative as were the other employees.  You never waited for anything.  It was busy too, so the service in my oppinion was fantastic for the amount of other tables.  I ordered the Chimi with red sauce. It was so yummy and it had a kick to it as well.  This rivals Ajo Al's for sure.   If you want good mexican food and a nice evening out, this is your place!",

The seating options are quite low budget and I felt gross for wearing a dress that didn't cover the back of my legs.  Dusty wire chairs with plastic covers or cement yard tables fill the Christmas light patio.  The \"kickass\" margarita was not the best- please tell me why no fresh lime???  $14 dollar drinks while perched on a dollar store seat?  The cup does not fool me.  The chip guy was on point and brought us more green salsa- which was our favorite.  I had a combination platter with a beef taco and red cheese enchilada.  The taco was not so great the meat was stringy but mushy- not shredded beef at all.  The enchilada was good with a spicy red sauce and homemade corn tortilla.   We continue to search for delicious Mexican food in a quality setting with a real lime margarita.",

    "text": "The entire experience was a giant \"Meh\" all around.  We reserved a table for six and were squished around a table for four.  It's wasn't terrible but it would behoove a dining establishment to make it larger-group-friendly.    The happy hour house margaritas were okay.  They tasted pretty watered down.  We ordered a pitcher later (at full price, of course) and it tasted better.  That's major points lost for me - an inferior happy hour version or Restaurant Week version does not inspire me to return.    Service was extremely slow although to their credit, it does say they're slow on the menu so they get points for honesty.  One of my dining companions noted that the menu says they charge $1 for a refill on chips.  That's a sad excuse for a Mexican joint in my opinion.    My food was spicy but just okay.  I got the feeling they cover up the average-ness of the food with a lot of spice.    It felt like one of those places where they nickel-and-dime you for everything.  I expect that at fast food restaurants but for a sit-down meal?  Where we would have likely lingered and spent money?  No thank you.",

    "text": "We were referred to Los Dos Molinos by our Uber driver. Although we've been exploring the Valley for 10'years, we have been looking for a \"go to\" Mexican restaurant. Grabbed a table in the adorable patio on a comfortable night. All staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Margarita was excellent, with the house Margarita very large and delicious. The chips kept coming (one helping of chips was somewhat stale; hence minus one star), with the salsas to die for, and a little bit of heat. We ordered the Adovada Enchilada dinner, green sauce, complete with fried egg on top & a chimichanga. Food was excellent, with the flavors just jumping out, New Mexico style. The rice and beans were very flavorful.   We capped off the meal with the apple sopapilla and vanilla ice cream. Sopapilla was hot, light and tasty and perfect with the sauteed bananas and ice cream. Overall we had an excellent meal and a new, fun place to go when craving Mexican! Prices were very reasonable, with our bill $53 including 2 meals, 2 drinks and dessert.",

I won't be going back. Hey Los Dos: even BANKS don't keep hours like this anymore!  Edit: and they reply to me with a snarky message that attempts to explain to me like I'm a child how they're a family business and they've done just fine for 40 years thank you very much and how overworked they are to boot. I guess every other restaurant in the city is using slave labor then? Yeah, OK, sure, Los Dos. You're a special flower. Whatever.

    "text": "Alrighty then...on to the bad news, unfortunately. I went in on a recent weekday in the early afternoon, but absolutely well after the lunch-rush. The chips and salsa were stellar, once again. Their red salsa could win awards....but I digress.   I learned that what I'd had before was not a 'special' that day, but rather, a normal specialty of the house. (Even more disappointing to see). Anyhow, I asked the waiter for the owner's special fave, and he pointed me to the Victoria's Chicken (breast). When I asked about what chili sauce to slather it with, he said \"Christmas\" (half each of red and green). Okay, bring it.  This time, I stopped inhaling the chips long enough for my tongue to recover for a better grasp of the entree. Unfortunately, there was little to reward my discipline. Out it came, with beans on one side and rice on the other. I spooned away the sauce from the near-end of the breast and cut off a piece to taste by itself.  It was bland, and also tough/stringy. It was apparent that no marinade was used, nor was it tenderized in any way. Micro'd? Boiled? Meh. Okay, then to taste a spoon of each sauce. More meh. Where's the HEAT they promise? More importantly, where's some flavor? Well, the answer for my hungry self was to add green SALSA to the sauce and red to the red, LOL. I got it down that way. Ditto the rice. While still bland, at least this time it was clearly fresh and hadn't been sitting long. Beans? Didn't touch them ....again. I would expect better from a Denny's, let alone this place.   I thought, having spared the chips, I could eat a little more. Let's try something totally 'standard' and see what happens. So, a green chili chicken tamale, and a ground-beef taco was next.   You know you always get a good bite of the masa alone from either end of a tamal? Well, it was coarsely ground, with a grainy odd texture, but also had no flavor by itself. The chicken inside appeared to be a mix of shredded breast with the same green chili sauce I had from the entree plate. Bland....I left it sit, and on to the taco. My first bite I nearly cursed. That 'beef' tasted like potted-meat beef-by-product. I removed the lettuce and tomato and dumped that wad of whatever onto the plate. It looked like pet food from a can, I KID YOU NOT. The texture was firm mush, picture dried-out-refried beans. Taco Bell is gourmet fit for the Royal Family, by comparison.  Alas, these two sealed it up for me....never again.",

    "text": "I've definitely experienced better in the Los Dos family of restaurants.  The menu warns about how hot and spicy the food is.  I suppose if you were a mid-westerner staying here on vacation, it might be hot, but in terms of local cuisine, it's hardly hotter than what you would get at a Denny's.  Service was slow as we were seated on the patio.  It took a while to get drinks, and my Jalapeno margarita was served in what appeared to be a leftover potted-plant container  It was square.  Yes, it was large, but that does not equal good.  I could hardly taste the tequila, and I guess what made it \"Jalapeno\" was the pickled Jalapeno they dropped into it.  I'd say pass on this and just get iced tea.  We started with a queso appetizer, which was okay, nothing threatening there.  It took a while to get the appetizer, and when it arrived, we scarfed it down from starvation.  I personally ordered the shredded beef chimi with green sauce, which should have left me hot and bothered, but I was only bothered, there was no hot.  This was my second visit here, the first time our food was so salty as to be practically inedible, and this time, while it did have flavor, it was missing the most important component that Los Dos is known for.  Unfortunately, there won't be a third visit.",

So many fantastic margaritas in Phoenix, this one was acidic and flavorless. Have lived in NM for years, and this food is nothing like what we had there. Chili relleno adovado was not hot like everyone says. I asked for guacamole with no onions, sorry, it's all made already. Got a salad instead of rice and beans and it was a half cup of lettuce garnish. No heat in my meal. Meat was tender and the flour tortillas were the best part of the meal. But special it was not. All that hoopla about how spicy the food is? Nah.  We will return to our favorite mexican place in phoenix, where we can get huge plates of delicious food, with fabulous drinks, and desert, for the price of a very small meal and two drinks here. And the final insult; the chips were awful. Stale and pretty much what you buy in a big bag and dish out when you don't make your own hot and fresh. Sad.",

Don't waste your time even trying this place. Go to the Mesa location and get real New Mexican food with great service, great margaritas, and great food.   Even the chips stuck here.",

I love it but others might not be able to handle the heat. The house margaritas is one of the best in the valley in my opinion. They had a good selection of mexican beers on draft: dos equis lager, pacifico, victoria, negro modelo.   I always get the carne adovado which is a slow roasted pork in red sauce. Its wrapped in a soft tortilla and topped with cheese. It pretty much melts in your mouth with the right amount of spice. The enchiladas here are also very good. Overall, this place tests less greasy and with none of the weird aftertaste I get with other mexican places like arribas,etc.",

Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life, and is pretty easy on the wallet considering how good it is (it's not dirt cheap but it's not expensive either, and I'm usually pretty stingy). Quality food and quality atmosphere. It's just fun, and nice and delicious and the servers are very professional and good at what they do. It's like it's solid and understated, but definitely a fun experience. Easiest 5 stars I ever gave in my life. You need to go to this place!",

The recommendation I got was for a beef stacked enchilada dinner with the green chili.  It is now my favorite and I honestly think it is perhaps the best Mexican dish in town.    The only downside is the parking lot.  I do not reallly like a parking lot that is lined with razor wire fences and hard to get in and out of - but I guess if the biggest complaint is the parking lot I can live with it.

It is really one of the best I have had.  I chose the ground beef and it was really good.  The beans are very tasty also!  So the food can stand on its own.  It is good quality and tastes good.  So the part that stopped me from giving this place a great rating is a few things.  One, the service was not spectacular in any way.  Two, margaritas were not very good.  They were strong but the taste was just off.  Three, the place was hot as hell!  Everyone in there was sweating.  So I will be back for the food...but maybe once the weather cools down!",

Now, I'm not old but I do have some ear issues that makes it hard to hear people talk when there is a lot of background noise. If I'm in a booth, I'm good, otherwise...it sucks. So, we chose to sit outside. Mistake #1. My chair (Pick Up Stix chair to be specific...yes, a chair with another co logo on it) was crazy dirty. I was sooo glad I wore black pants. Like, I brushed it off with my hand and my hand was black. The table wobbled but I didn't want to sit at the concrete patio table so I leaned ever so slightly that we keep it balanced. Mistake #2 I ordered water w/lemon. Lemons took a while to actually show up. The water was awful. Like...really gross even with my 3 lemon wedges. And ice? Forget it. But, the waiter was very attentive to the margarita chuggin' lady at the table next to us. The chip guy came by and asked if we wanted more chips...we say yes please...he disappears with our bowl and it was never to be seen again.   Now... the food. The salsa was too spicy. The first couple of bites were good but then the temp set in and well, I couldn't taste much after that. I'm all for spicy but I think (like our table) there needs to be a balance of kick and just flat out burn your tastebuds off spicy. I ordered the shrimp tacos ($14.95). Hmmm... 4 pieces of shrimp. That was it and they were NOT even jumbo shrimp. And 1 tortilla. But I guess when you only have 4 small pieces of shrimp, you only need 1?  Some plain ol' pinto beans and then rice. The rice was ok, I actually make better mexican rice and I'm a white girl. My rice had some green sauce slathered all over it and some melted cheese. I was very disappointed because I'm a HUGE shrimp taco fan. My hubby ordred a beef dish, maybe it was a burro or something and the meat, like the salsa, was overly spicy.  Let me move on to the misters outside. At times it was nice, typical misting action. Other times, we were gorillas in the mist. Maybe that explains the adundance of dirt on my filthy Pick Up Stix chair??  Anyway, we won't go back. I guess maybe had I been chuggin' margaritas we would have recieved better service and maybe the food would have tasted better. Who knows...",

Trying the shrimp garlic, it had a light peppery sauce with pinto beans and rice as a side dish. You are rarely served pinto beans at a mexican restaurant. It added to the dish. The salsa was extremely hot but if you are into burning your mouth until it's numb, this is the real stuff! The sopapillo dessert was served warm with drizzled honey and cinnamon. It was light and melted in your mouth.  I enjoyed the quality of the staff too, the female hostesses looked like they stepped out of the movie Frida or a flamenco club. Outdoor seating in the desert winter had a beautiful added touch of flamed fire heaters. I will definitely be returning.",

It's housed in what used to be Padres, great location around 10th and Camelback.   I ordered the Carne adobada ribs with beans and rice and my wife got the posole. When I'm thinking ribs, I'm wanting a decent portion of meat on or off the bone. What I got was 2 very small pieces of pork that totaled probably less than one total pork rib, covered in sauce so spicy that you couldn't taste anything else on the plate. The beans were teh same way. They were simmered with the same burn your face off red chili, and pretty tough to get through. the rice was dry and it seemed bland (but I coudlnt' taste very much after eating the red sauce, so who knows). My wife ordered the posole with green chile and it too was too spicy for her to eat. After our mea, we had asked the server about the ability to put the chile on the side and said that was an option for next time..but I can't say there will be a next time. While I'm all for some good spicy food, don't burn my face off and call that tasty. I was really wanting to love this place but the food just fell flat for me.",

Our server, Jorge was one of the best servers we have had at a restaurant. He was friendly, personable, attentive and passionate about the food and drinks. We can't wait to come back!",

I want to love this place like some of my friends, but going to the original one and waiting for hours just to get some special \"Hot\" food has left me feeling not positive for the visit to this new location.   Went on a Wednesday with the Mrs and a friend that pushed me through the door. Same Padre's feel... I was feeling better. Got seated right away and got chips and salsa and waters pretty quick... alright! and then we sat, and sat, and sat. We were in a little room in the front where the entrance to the patio was and could see all the servers headed in and out with drinks and food. I knew it was too good to be True. Finally got a drink order in and he was def hurried. no small talk, just wanted you to order. I think the the place was maybe 1/3 full.   Got drinks and then waited for about 15 minutes. WTF! Finally ordered with not even a \"Eff You!\" from the waiter. At least it gave us time to catch up and take in the decor. Food came and looked better than i remembered. But the food was the same... Meh. (see other LDM review) Meh NM style food. My family is from NM. I grew up on the stuff! This is just hot to tasteless, salty plate of rice and beans!   I would come back to have HH at the bar. area At least Padre's left that to still be enjoyed.",

No lunch menu so no break on prices.  We each got an entree a beer and a Bloody Mary- final bill was $42.00 what!?  Service was great.  Food not so much.  Bloody Mary had way too much Tabasco- couldn't hardly drink.  I had breakfast taquitos that were okay but not great.  The flour tortilla was puffy which is different.  My husband had a beef burrito that was ok but could have gotten the same at Taco Bell... Needless to say we will not be returning.",

My mom got a chicken taco salad and I got the chicken taco combination with rice and beans. We both agreed that the chicken tasted more like turkey and I wasn't impressed by their food. It seemed average, I've definitely been to better Mexican restaurants in the area. The biggest reason I'm giving two stars is because anytime we asked for anything at the table it seemed like we were an inconvenience. Additionally, the prices seem pretty for the quality and portion that you get. I probably won't be back to this spot again. It's alright for a one time try.",

Raised in Las Cruces, NM, we were not impressed the last time and were not impressed this time either.   We came to celebrate my daughters 17th birthday and we had a large group of 17. They should of had more than 1 waiter helping out. My dad got the wrong item, he asked for red enchilada plate but accidentally pointed to red chili plate on the menu, so that was what he got.  My cousin asked for red enchilada plate with an egg and got 1 red enchilada. Nothing else. The people that did get eggs, the eggs were overcooked. NO YOLK! You can't serve an overcooked egg with red enchiladas. Any Authentic Mexican restaurant knows that!  We had to order 2 more eggs needless to say.   And when I asked if they did anything for birthdays, they first said \"No\" and then came back and said they could do a friend tortilla with cinnamon and icecream for $20. Yeah, NO THANK YOU.  I'm a single mom who is already spending WAY too much for a less than mediocre experience and you want to charge me $20 for a tortilla and scoop of ice cream!!   My friend asked my family across the table if this was good Mexican food.. they all said at once \"NO\" it was quite comical.  We had a good time celebrating as a family but we wont be coming back to your establishments anymore.",

We have subsequently come to Phoenix the last 3 years for spring training.  Although this is really my husband's trip, my non-negotiable demand for Phoenix trips is Los Dos Molinos.  The chile relleno is fabulous-all the food we've had there has been good.  The restaurant itself is kind of a charming rabbit-warren of connected smallish rooms and patios that are always full of multi-age, multi-generational, and multi-cultural tables of happy eaters and drinkers.  The bar is good sized but this is probably not a good place to go if you are in a hurry....just sayin",

I had just a little bit of hard time convincing my friends & family to try this place but none of us was disappointed!    The food is delicious  :)  Try the salsas prior to ordering so that you'll know how you want your food prepared.  The service was great.  Our waiter took the time to explain everything to us & was very attentive to our requests (my wife orders food like Meg Ryan from \"When Harry Met Sally\" - ugh).  If you don't like spicy food then you should just leave now, you'll be sorry if you don't.  I have a friend who can't eat too much black pepper - she would probably explode if she ate here.",

    "text": "Meh...  Been here 3 times now and I am less impressed with the place each time. This time was the usual Margaritas (always good - but just some house pre-mix so they cant really screw it up), along with some Orange Blossom??? draft beers that are surprisingly tasty, but seem to be lacking in alcohol content.  We ordered chicken soft tacos (which were a small corn shell instead of the expected flour). I thought they were very bland in comparison to the red and green salsas they supplied with the complementary chips. We also ordered the grande burrito (deep fried). The only thing \"grande\" about it was the price. It, too, was very bland IMO (or maybe my taste-buds were just still on vacation after being burnt by the red salsa???). Either way, the size made it nowhere near worth the $12 asking price.  One thing that was somewhat disturbing- we ordered our food and it literally arrived like 1-2 minutes later. WTF? She said they put our order in front of a larger table.  OK? Now for the disturbing part- This must mean that every time I go for mexican food, all they do is make me wait 10-15 minutes for my food, when in reality, this is just so that I think that they are actually cooking something? Good to know.  The service started out attentive, but since one of us is a chips and salsa junkie (not me) they seemed to start ignoring our flag downs for more chips on the 3rd request. I figured since the tiny tacos and burrito they presented did not satisfy, maybe that was why we were still hungry after finishing our orders? Either way, Management listen up... don't be stingy with your tiny bowls of chips and salsas!  On the plus side- The one thing I do like about this location is the atmosphere, but since we only end up here due to the BMW dealer being nearby, here's hoping the car will not need any services for a long while.",

I hadn't been here since they moved from their downtown location, and think the new location lacks some of the funkiness that made the old location a hit.  I definitely can't complain though, because the new place is much closer to my neck of the woods.    I can't figure out the parking though, there is not much of it, and the alley to the rear of the building is a bit narrow.  I was a little concerned about leaving my car back there even in the middle of the day.  Also, there is another lot that I saw customers parking in, but it is surrounded with barbed wire and clearly states that the parking area is owned by the car dealership not the restaurant and that violators will be towed.  Food is great though...  Just wished I was driving a rental.",

The guy next to us eating his meal was complaining alot about how the sauce wasn't hot at all.      Chips and salsa were free at the bar - they were decent with two salsa's. Also noticed like another Yelper did that the food comes out like 2 minutes after ordering. This can only mean one thing, nothing is made to order and that means you can do alot better than the food here. The fake Chile Relleno was enough to send my running.",

Los Dos Molinos Uptown is to love and pain what Reese's is to chocolate and peanut butter; It is quite simply my favorite restaurant on Earth and tastefully skates between \"too much\" and \"never enough.\"  I'm blessed to have eaten at every Los Dos Molinos location (Springerville, South Phoenix, Mesa, Manhattan, Uptown) and this is THE best of The Best. Take your antacid, drop the gloves and enjoy. The food is hot, True; but, it's also extremely complex, taking diners to their respective edge.  No worries, their margaritas are as good as their food (and that's saying a lot!), providing the delicious fire hydrant's worth of tequilaandallsortsofs***thatifailtomakeanysenseof. But, walk softly -- like the food -- these margaritas mean business. Between the food AND beverages, you're in for it.  Again, if you've purchased a \"Pace\" product in your life, please find your local Macayos. If you're into living life to the fullest, go no further. Finally, the restaurant has a great ambiance, working equally well for a first date, Happy Hour or birthday party. The staff is second to none, and yes, the bartender is Drop Dead Gorgeous. True.",

I had never been to Los Dos Molinos (but have heard loads about it) so we decided to give it a shot!  We were seated quickly and the decor is dark and cozy, which I love! They even had festive Christmas decor around. They immediately brought waters and chips with two different homemade salsas. Both were so yummy! We ordered guac which was also tasty - super simple, just the way I like it.  For drinks, I tried to order a virgin margarita but was told they don't do virgin drinks so I went with Sprite. I have to say, our server wasn't the friendliest (hence my docked star). I'm not sure if he was just busy and stressed or if that is a normal thing but we felt rushed to order and he seemed agitated. My friend got the Sangrita (Sangria + Margarita) and liked it! The cocktails are pretty pricy (~$12). But they're a much better deal on Happy Hour!   For my meal, I ordered their slow roasted pork burrito (on the family specials page) Christmas style with red and green sauce and it was SO AMAZING! This definitely deserved 5 stars. I loved my meal. You can tell the rice and beans are homemade, the tortillas may even be too, and the flavors were just the best.   All in all, I would definitely come back, maybe on Happy Hour next time (until 6p) since i'll be able to drink again after baby! Thanks for a tasty meal!",

Also, the portion sizes are generous. You will definitely not be hungry after eating here. In fact, you will probably have some leftovers.  I look forward to going to the restaurant and sitting down for a meal. If ordering takeout from this place was impressive, I can only imagine how tasty this food is right out of the cocina!",

Our favorite is the #6 Beef Machaca burro combo plate, which is the spiciest thing on the menu. We always compliment it with a couple Beef tacos in hard shells, which are not spicy, but wonderfully seasoned. Add salsa and it's an inferno :-) The atmosphere is very casual, the owners and staff are all friendly. It's a family owned business and the experience is similar a across the Valley.",

I've always wanted to stop in here and really enjoy authentic New Mexican cuisine after eating at a few good establishments in that state.   The decor was very welcoming and warm. Really enjoyed the art and sayings on the walls.   We were one of only a few there so we saddled up to the bar and was immediately welcomed by the bartender. We started with a few drinks, chips and salsa, followed by a cheese enchilada.   Definitely a great spot and wouldn't mind a quick return.",

There is so much to look at and is cute and clean and well decorated. But with that being said I had the breakfast burrito with the green sauce. The sauce was not very good, it didn't have that much flavor except for the fact that my face was sweating from the spice. If it wasn't for the fact that it was spicy I would not have known the sauce was on there. The burrito itself was kinda bland but I did not have the beans inside so that may have helped. I do have to say that the burrito was huge and for only $9.00 I thought it was very nicely priced.",

    "text": "We were out to try somewhere different, so we opted for Los Dos Molinos for some spice. After parking in the back which was not very well lit, somewhat cramped, and a short walk to the front of the restaurant, we walked into a dark bar area where the front door is. Not wanting to wait or eat outside, we opted for a high top in the bar area. A short while after being seated we were met with a fly by waiter with salsa and chips, he must have been on a schedule. The chips and salsa were outstanding and have a different type of flavor and spice I wasn't quite accustomed to.   Then after a short wait we were greeted by our smiling waitress tut refilled our chips and salsa and took our drink order.After perusing the menu with the flashlight on our phone like a bunch of detectives looking for a clue, we all settled on the chimi with different fillings and sauces.  Detective #1 (yours truly) opted for the adovada with red sauce, the rest of the detectives ordered chicken with both sauces, red and green, on the side. My first bite was like an explosion of crime solving flavors. The chimi was light and crispy despite being covered in the best red sauce a crime fighter ask for. The rest of the food was the same way except for reports of the chicken tasting kind of bland. That's what they get for not living on the edge!  My synopsis is if you're looking for some New Mexico style flavors, look no further than Los Dos Molinos.",

    "text": "After my fiance heard about Los Dos from his brother, we started coming here and absolutely love it! My fiance's parents make great Mexican food, so he is really picky and will rarely eat Mexican food out, but he loves this place even more than me, so that's how I know it's good ;)   Los Dos has amazing margaritas, but beware - they really are so strong! The first time we came I drank one and a quarter De La Rosa and had the worst hangover ever lol. They are super tasty though. Now I just stick to the Fresh or House Margarita (I recommend House if you don't want anything crazy).   To eat, we often get the Chorizo Dip to start, it's so good and is actually really spicy, but we love it! For dinner, my fiance usually gets the Adovada Burrito Dinner which he's obsessed with, and I get the Shredded Beef Chimichanga (I LOVE chimis but I feel like they're hard to find since most places are really just taco places). This last time though I got the a la carte tacos - one chicken and two beef - and they were really good! I will say I wasn't huge on the chicken because it seemed very plain, but I loved the beef.   Our one complaint about Los Dos in the past has been the service, as our waiters have often seemed a little unfriendly and maybe cranky, but on this last visit we had Scotty, who's new. We loved Scotty!! He mentioned he has a lot of restaurant experience before coming to Los Dos, and you can tell. He was so friendly and polite, someone I would love to see there again!   Overall totally love this spot, definitely my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!",

Green chili cheese crisp which is normally to die for was flacid and the sauce tasted \"off\" and bitter.    Next came a  shredded beef chimichanga which was stuffed with watery, tasteless beef.  The accompanying beans were good. The rice was tasteless but had decent texture.  Top it off with an ice tea that A. was not ordered as flavored and B. was heavily flavored with some unidentifiable potpourri-esque flavor and it was a soundly disappointing meal all the way around.     Whatever has happened I hope they right this sinking ship.  Edited 10/25/18  I am super unhappy to report that I have had gastrointestinal distress since yesterday evening.  My guess is the sauce that tasted \"off\" ...was in fact spoiled and now I am paying the price.  Before you go thinking \"Oh well\" let me tell you...I have a medical issue that makes infection of any sort potentially life threatening so I am NOT pleased.",

You need to understand that the food is New Mexico style, so while similar to Mexican food is has certain nuances (spice levels and certain ingredients) that set it apart.  The food at Los Dos Molinos is spicy, but the menu guides you a bit.  If your not sure, I highly suggest having the waiters/waitresses help you figure out what you might enjoy without getting scorched.   Trust me, this place has some scorching dishes, easily washed down with a good beer or margarita.  My favorites are the Sopapillas, Blue corn enchilada (add Chicken) and the Garlic Roast Pork.  The service here is good and the staff is friendly, but like any place that gets busy you may need to deal with a few delays, so sit back, relax and have a Cerveza or Margarita.",

    "text": "Hello All.  I been eating Mexican Food  for many years In Arizona, Southern California and New Mexican.  I can say without exception that all the food served at Los Dos Molinos is authentic southwest flavored and extremely good!  Of PARTICULAR NOTE is that they are now serving, and I understand it will be a regular menu item, GRILLED (not fried) FISH TACOS.  Their Fish Tacos are literally the best you can find in Phoenix and believe me, I love grilled Fish Tacos and have been trying to find Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix that serve really good grilled Fish Tacos.  There are very few Restaurants in Phoenix that even serve grilled (not fried) Fish Tacos but none that you can find elsewhere that even compare with what Los Dos Molinos is currently serving.  I will also say the atmosphere is very nice and the service is very friendly and the best.  If you like really good Fish Tacos treat yourself and try them at Los Dos Molinos.",

We had a party of 6 and sat in the front bar area by the window. I had to ask for drinks, water and to place our order. finally another server came so the service improved 1/2 way through.  One of the couples had never been, she ordered the shrimp dish with rice and cheese. It's a $15 dollar dish and only got 4 shrimp.  And she didn't care much for it.  But the highlight was a cockroach running around under our table.  I had to go get staff to take care of that. I realize most restaurants have them, ya just don't see them. But that kinda ruined it for me along with the spiciness. One more thing, the music was high energy like dance club and loud. And it was early, about 530 on a Saturday.",

We were greeted by one dude, brought drinks by another and waited on by a third, none had much personality and seemed bored to be there. The kick ass margaritas were more like pat on the ass, weak with a mix that tasted vaguely like Sauza mix watered down with some fresh lime squeezed in. We had to order an extra shot to give them some life. The cheese crisp was so-so, I think it was a Mission tortilla, definitely not handmade. The enchaladas had a pepper next to them denoting spicy, but they were not spicy at all, and the chicken was over shredded. The carnitas was flavorless and greasy. Too bad because the south location is such a hike, but we will be headed there next time.",

Of course comes with rice and beans and is a healthy portion for the price.  Chips and salsa are superb and we debate each visit which is spicier, the red or the green.

    "text": "I went here last night with my man and a friend because our friend likes spicy food.  The last time we were here even the beans were spicy so we thought we'd take him to try it out.  You get seated and they give you glasses and a pitcher of water right away.  I figure they do this because they know you'll be crying for water very shortly once you try the salsa.  Let me tell you, the salsa is hot!   Both the red and green are hot.  The chips are thin, warm and crispy.  The service was great.  They were right on top of things and kept our drinks full and our chip bowl stocked.  I ordered a taco, tostada and beans (no rice).   I expected the beans to be your typical refried beans with a kick but these were whole beans.  They were okay but I prefer the typical style.  These beans were not spicy at all.  I was kind of relieved because my mouth was burning from the salsa.  The tostada was very tasty once I got the extra cheese I ordered.  The taco, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about, and that's a bummer because tacos are my favorite.  I am not a fan of their beef for their tacos.  I like shredded beef and this was more like a juicy ground beef.  Not a deal breaker but I would love to have shredded beef as an option.  Our friend ordered a Mexican pizza and it was huge.  It used the same ground beef that they put in the tacos so it was just alright to me.  It was an ample serving though so this place gets points for that.  My friend didn't think any of the food was that spicy but he buys all the weird hot sauces on the market so I'm thinking he is desensitized.    This place is A-OK to me.  The service was very fast on a Tuesday night.  Maybe I should have ordered the more spicy items for my meal but I don't think my tongue could have handled it, LOL.  It's definitely worth a try but I will be sticking with my regular Mexican food spot.",

I ordered a pork tostada and pork taco entree which was very greasy and tasteless ( i taste more grease then anything else). Rice was bland and beans taste as though it came from a can. Definitely not what I remember of items I have enjoyed in New Mexico. Only item I did enjoy was their salsa. My friend ordered an entree which was Carne something, which he said had very little meat.

No time did our waiter ever return to fill ice tea glasses, and finally when we were  done he did return and fortunately did not ask how it was.  We had to ask twice for a carry home box.

So this place was recommended to me based on that and that fact that I love spicy food. The service was great. The food was good. I had the beef enchiladas with red and green. New Mexican's don't mess around about their green chile. They say their green chile is from NM, maybe it was prepared a little different than I am used to because it tasted a bit different, (maybe not roasted the same?), but still satisfying. My husband can't do super spicy and there are not too many options for the mild eaters. My husband will most likely not return, but I will! I want to try the adovada.

A traditional margarita, and stiff, but not overkill. I felt great after one.  I ordered the Pork Adovada Chili Relleno. Very good, not the greatest taste sensation to ever grace my taste buds, but very delicious and filling. My mother had some enchiladas and she demolished them after saying she wasn't that hungry. So they were good.  Our server answered a couple questions and he knew exactly how some of the things were made.  We went here on a recommendation, otherwise we never would've found it. And had we found likely would've passed. But my mothers friend said if you like spicy Mexican try it.  Everything we had was spicy, starting from the salsa through the meals. But not uncomfortably spicy. You knew you were getting heat in every bite but it wasn't overkill. Excellent flavor and spicy is a flavor not a crutch to lean on if your culinary skills are subpar.  They did it right. Some people have baby tongues and this may not be the place for them. Many signs  through out the restaurant decor and on the menu state, more or less, \"this is our food, take it or leave it\". The combos state no substitutions, and if a place is on point, I'm good with that. They know how they do their thing and if you found the place, just sit back and let them do it. You'll be happy.  I enjoy restaurants that put their own unique twist on tacos and enchiladas and other Mexican food, sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss. But I'll always lean toward a traditional Mexican place, especially if they pay attention to particular ingredients and preparation.  This place is right in my wheelhouse. Good staff, great food and drink, a tingly tongue and mouth after, but enjoyably so. And if you indulged in a few margaritas, you'll be floating out the door like I was, fueled up a ready to continue the adventure.  I'll be back here for sure when I'm in town. And I'll pass it on to anyone I know will appreciate it.  Thank you for a fantastic last meal and experience in Phoenix.",

The food was a small portion for that price $14.95 each plate. It was just super hot could not even taste any seasonings.  Just had a burning mouth. Couldn't believe that we were charged $1.50 per tortilla.  You only get 1 tortilla with the meal.  Server should of mention the extra fee per tortilla. Will not go there again!!!",

We asked about the different margaritas and the bartender explained them. We said that we wanted the fresh margaritas and he pointed us to the ones on the menu where the pitchers were $29. We asked for grand marnier as a floater. We had two pitchers and the bill was $120!!  This just doesn't make sense. The manager came over and worked it out as a misunderstanding but threw in the shot, enjoy your margaritas. Then, some jerk that was sitting next to us very loudly said oh is there a problem with their bill, I will cover it. He implied that we couldn't pay for our tab so I promptly informed the guest that we could pay for our bill, thank you very much but we were told one price and then charged double for what we ordered. Not the restaurants fault of the jerk trying to show off but it is their fault for trying to rip us off at the bar.  After that, table service and food was great.",

    "text": "I am a super busy person, so it's been difficult for me to find an opportunity to go to this place. I was curious ever since I heard that they specialize in really spicy food.  Los Dos Molinos did't fail to please. The outside looks a little generic, so when I walked in I was almost surprised to see such a beautiful and hip, yet traditional cantina style atmosphere with modern (electronica) music playing. The staff was friendly and down to earth.   The complimentary chips and salsas (one red, one green tomatillo) were very tasty. The green salsa was pretty serious...definitely hotter than the hottest salsa you get at the Taco Guild, but still flavorful and enjoyable. I am very happy that I finally found a place where I do not have to beg to get something that I consider spicy-hot.  I ordered a house margarita, blue corn tamale, and a side of rice and beans. I was amazed by the unique, smoky flavor of the tamale. The rice (yellow) and beans were very saucy, topped with a touch of melted shredded cheese, and delicious. I like that Los Dos is hip, but not above serving rice and beans. Best of all, the tamale had a spicy kick on its own.   Everything was delicious and what i considered to be spicy done right. People looking to have tears stream out of their eyes might be disappointed...but people who sneeze after just looking at a bottle of Frank's Red Hot would't be able to handle most of the dishes there (there is a little pepper icon next to the spicy stuff to help those with tender tongues find something palatable). I'll be going back soon.",

The decor in this location is far more upscale - like a day at the ranch meets Dia de Muertos. We sat at a nice table in the back and immediately received a basket of fresh chips with green and red \"holy f#%k that is hot\" salsa. The other location served us bag chips but with a lot more palatable salsa.  To make a direct comparison between locations I ordered the exact same thing, a chicken burro with a side of rice. The difference was huge, literally. The burro I received in Ahwatukee was the size of a swaddled baby whereas this one was at a minimum half the size. It was still a big enough portion for a typical adult, but I sure didn't need a doggy bag. My rice on the side was over cooked and crunchy. Because the salsa was so unnecessarily hot I did not want to use it on my food even though it kind of needed it. My husband's adovada ribs were delicious but he did not receive too much meat on his plate. We ended the meal with some sopapillas which were quite tasty.   Service was extraordinarily attentive at times but then we went through periods of being ignored. I am not sure that this place is worth a revisit. 2.5 stars.",

    "text": "So, I moved out here to the Valley from Illinois in 1989, taking a job in Mesa. Often for lunch, we would go down Main St. to Los Dos Molinos, where Victoria and her family had moved down from Springerville to pump out amazing food in an old Der Weinerschnitzel. I watched as the family got so busy that they opened the Alma School location and later the Phoenix South Central location. The sign out front of this Camelback/Uptown location says \"New Mexican\" cooking. So let's correct this upfront. It's not the New Mexican cooking style of Santa Fe and Albuquerque; Los Dos Molinos is and has always been a unique style specific to the border of Arizona and New Mexico. Today is the first time that I visited the Camelback/Uptown location. My impression is this...the care of the family's cooking is still there, but the heat has been toned down from the family's earliest days in Mesa and Phoenix. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I recall my first visit to the South Central location not long after they opened. I remember the intense chile heat starting with the salsa and chips all the way through every taste of the meal. We're talking tongue-numbing, eye-watering chile heat (that's not a complaint, I like heat.) Today at the Uptown location, the heat was suggested but not overwhelming. Stepping inside, this location has immediate character and warmth. We sit at the bar and immediately get friendly service. Chips and both salsa verde and salsa roja arrive quickly. Both salsas have a fresh bite to them and are delicious. I order the adovada enchilada \"Christmas\" and my other half orders the chimichanga, shredded beef, both with beans and rice. The adovada was large pieces of well-cooked pork, the shredded beef was tender and flavorful. We finished every bite and agreed that we would be back. For environment, service and satisfaction when one has a hunger for Arizona-Mexican cuisine, this will be high on the list.",

    "text": "I had never heard of this Mexican food restaurant before we were invited to attend a birthday celebration that took place tonight. I looked over the menu online, checked out reviews, and made what I hoped would be great choices while we were there.  It was a bit cramped at our table of 8 while ordering, no room to really look over the menues but, not too big of a deal since I had mostly chosen beforehand. Our waiter came and was so quick to take our order that he cut me off not even half way through my order of a main dish and add on choices, and then proceeded to skip my husband/date.   The salsa was excellent, nice and hot, as well as flavorful. The chips were good.  Once my meal came I was very underwhelmed. I ordered a green corn tamale, a green beef enchilada with an egg, and beans with a side of sour cream.    The green corn tamale was nothing but very thick and over cooked masa. It's crowning achievement was it's spiciness. It felt like I was supposed to enjoy the fact that it was spicy and ignore the fact that it was bland, overcooked, and unremarkable. I left it on the plate half way through, I was hoping the middle would taste like something more but, it did not.  The green beef enchilada was missing the beef completely I think? Unless the beef was pulverized into the green chili sauce? And even that was barely flavorful. Really again, it was just nice and spicy, hoping to carry itself with the spice but, lacked for flavor...   The beans were beans...  I certainly have no interest in going back. I can make spicy at home, I love spicy. But spicy without flavor is not good cooking. And rushed service makes you feel unimportant. Not a good experience. They assumed an 18% tip was acceptable and added it to our bill. As an ex waitress, this is never ok with me. It is rude. If I feel you deserve more and you assume, then you do not get more, you will likely get less despite it being policy at times.",

I didn't even like hot, spicy foods then but they converted me. I've loved their food ever since but was without it for more than 25 years while living in Colorado. Having recently moved to Phoenix I went looking for the restaurant as I knew they had a Phoenix location, at least way back then. Thank heavens they have several in the Phoenix alley! If you life hot spicy well prepared classic Mexican food, you have to try Los Dos Molinos. I've truly not had better in all my years.  I had a favorite mom & pop Mexican food restaurant in Colorado that still makes the best hot green chili sauce, but Los Dos's food is better. It's definitely sooo much better than the Macayo's  and other chain Mexican food places and so far, beats all other mom & pop, non-chain local mexcan food places like Federico's, Filiberto's, Julioberto's (and any other that sound much the same as those three places) Lupita's, Caramba's, Salsita, etc. Want it hot? Want it tasty? Then you want Los Dos Molino's! (I have no affiliation with Los Dos, nor am I asked/paid to review them.)",

Service was fast and really on top of keeping my Alex's iced tea filled, that's hard to do with Alex, he drinks alot of tea. They get points for that. I checked into the gluten free options and they didn't have a menu but he did say that their red sauce was made with corn starch, somehow i wasn't completely  convinced so i went safe and went with a taco salad minus the flour tortilla shell, i really enjoyed that, next time i will add green onions, the only thing missing.  I can't remember what my Alex had but here's a picture, it looks really good, huh? I miss eating things like that. Salsa was really hot and i thought the red sauce had tons of flavor, i sided with the red over the green.  We will eat here again, food was delicious!",

No smile, no greeting, no identification as to if he even worked there. He just glared as he slowed in front of me. That's when I said I had an order for pick up. Still glaring, he pointed to the back end of the bar. He does work there as I saw him pass to the back while I paid. But Wow! Deduct two stars...   I walked towards the back end of the bar and immediately heard and felt the stickiness of the floor. Something was not cleaned up properly, perhaps the mop was used and just spread the stickiness around? I tried maneuvering around, but there was no getting around it. Deduct a star...  The young bartender? Bus boy? Smiled and greeted me, I told him I have a pick up. He said my name, verified my order and showed me my ticket/cost $17.50. I paid and signed, he wished me well. Add a star...  The chips and salsa were the highlights. They came with both a red AND green salsa! Green was my favorite, and spicy. Red was spicier but still tasty. The blue corn tamale was smothered in sauce, so was it really blue corn? Couldn't have been able to tell you under the sauce and melted cheese. The red beef burrito, enchilada style can feed two easily. I ended up pulling out the beef and eating the flour tortilla and sauce. Tamale and burrito, Egh.. Deduct a star... Chips and salsa shouldn't be the only highlight.  Will I be back? Maybe for that green salsa, perhaps a different menu item? But then again, perhaps not.",

The complementary salsas and chips they set down almost immediately confirmed this.  Seriously, the two salsas (green & red) were probably two of the most flavorful and hottest (the red at least) salsas I've ever had at a restaurant.  The Main course (red chili) also had a really good spice level that you don't always find at  american mexican or new mexican restaurants although it wasn't quite as hot as I was anticipating after hearing about this place and seeing the warning on the menu.  If you don't handle spicy food well you might feel differently. The beef itself also had a lot of flavor and was quite tender.  They have pretty decent happy hour too.  As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said \"I'll be back!\".",

Their happy hour is the best deal in town and need to try it next time.  Chorizo dip is yum, I wish it was spicier but I add the Hot sauce and it's amazing. Comes with flour tortilla chips that you wish you had a bag of.  Can't ever decide on red or green sauce so I get both on enchiladas or burritos. Whole pinto beans and rice always compliment the plate. Oh you must get a shredded beef taco, the most tender flavorful beef I've ever had. Flautas also perfect medium fried rolls I had one leftover for breakfast one day.  The decor is funky and AZ cowboy style, lots to look at and feels like home. The bar area is nice and dim but feels festive always.  Employees seem to like their job and work there forever which is wonderful to see the same friendly faces. Always accommodating.  I need to figure out how to FedEx some Los Dos Molinas to my door I miss it already",

To my surprise,  even though I loved my green chimichanga in front of me,  I loved the red even more!  He loved MY green sauce more than his red!  Sauce so good it made us change teams!  Sauce teams that is! . What a beautiful food experience!  Can't wait to go back and try more menu items!",

All locations in the valley are family owned and YOU can tell!!! The service is always terrific! We have been coming to the restaurant for several years now and the staff is attentive and wants to please. The lack of attrition of staff which says EVERYTHING you need to know, servers with Los Dos have been there over 20+ years.... Kudos to everyone who makes us feel very special when we are there including: Drew, Reina, \"Their Family Aunt\", Chris, Jorge, Bernie and everyone else! When you drive close to thirty miles each way at least twice a week should say everything you need to know. AND don't forget to order the FRESH Margaritas - the best!!! Thank you Reina!!!   Beyond the staff.. Lets talk food!!!   We are foodies and have been blessed to dine from Manhattan to around the world. When we come back home from our travels we CAN NOT wait to go to our favorite place! We love spice and Los Dos knows how to deliver. Its spicy and yummy, but its NOT just HOT, you can taste the flavor of the food. The salsas are AMAZING!   Don't miss out on the following:  -- Carne Adovada  -- Green Chicken Enchilada  -- Garlic Pork anything!!!  -- Tostados are delicious (hint: add an egg on top!)   Dessert: Wowowow!!  -- Sopapillas   Drinks:  -- Again Fresh Margarita!!    As stated we are foodies and appreciate: TERRIFIC, FRESH and QUALITY food.  THEY will not let you down...the other reviewers that have provided poor reviews.  DON'T let that stop you from enjoying the BEST food in the Valley!  All the best to LOS DOS and we CAN's wait to be there tomorrow!",

I explained the situation and he says \"nope we're just not set up for that.\"  I asked why is it any different than putting egg on top of an enchilada?  He responded with \"You should know we just don't do that.\"  And walked away.......needless to say the food could have been the best on the planet but my experience was over.  BTW, the food was mediocre at best.  They make it super hot to simulate New Mexican food. I'm from New Mexico and it was nothing like the food there.  Lastly I ordered the red chili ribs.  They were not ribs.  it was just a plate full of carne adovada that had been cooked in a pot.   Unfortunately I will not be back mainly due to the managers lack of interest in being helpful.",

    "text": "Sat at the bar.  It was too dark.  No one needing a menu could read it- everyone had to get their phones out.  Service was good.  My food was 'Meh'.  Ordered a beef taco with rice. Not very tasty- ordinary.  The only part that stood out was the hard shell- surprisingly thin which was good.  The rice was almost cold.  It was dry and not very good.  My husband LOVES the enchiladas here though.  About 15 years ago we went to the south mountain location.  Staff was horrid, but the food was amazing.  Was super excited to come across this on Camelback hoping for some decent tasting New Mexican food.  I think they likely have their specialties and the taco was not that.  Not many vegetarian options other than cheese.  Not veggie Burrito or anything like that.  I will stick with Via De los Santos in Sunnyslope.  MUCH better.",

    "text": "Oy, where to begin? I struggled with how to rate this location and I echo the sentiments of fellow Yelpers: it truly does not possess the same fabulosity as the downtown location. The Pros: I called for a takeout order (beef burro, x-mas style - red & green chile) and it was ready as soon as I walked in. The Cons: I got home to find that I did not in fact get a beef burro x-mas style, but rather a beef chimichanga with green chile only. Chimichangs are, historically speaking, not my bag and since it's served enchilada style, I didn't realize it was fried until I tucked into it. I noticed the lack of red chile but decided to try anyway. After realizing I'd gotten the wrong order, I called the restaurant and spoke to the gentleman who packed up my burro. He insisted that he had given me the correct order and said I could \"bring it back for (him) to look at\" and for a moment, I thought, perhaps the error was mine. I hung up the phone and more carefully inspected my lunch: yep, definitely a chimi with green chile. I called back to speak to him and explained that there was a beef chimi with green chile sitting in front of me and he seemed surprised and offered to exchange it right away. I told him I was not able to return that day and he promised a free burro upon my next visit.   I have not yet returned and I don't know if I will come back to this location. The food is really very good but the service seemed super-rushed and when I took umbrage with my order, I was initially met with an incredulous response.  I do hope they can get it together because it would be great to have a reliable Los Dos location in this neighborhood.",

We were seated promptly and were treated like family. Reminded me of the old days going to the \"A\" frame in Mesa. I highly recommend  and will return soon. Bonus of running into old friends.",

    "text": "I've driven past Los Dos Molinos many times and always wanted to go in.  Finally finding the opportunity to try the food, my daughter and I ventured in and found a table.  We were well attended during our visit.  Two salsas arrived at our table -- green and red.  The red is the hotter of the two, and both have substance.  I ordered the green chili enchiladas because green chili is spicier than red chili, and who doesn't like enchiladas.  It came with an egg sunny side up.  I would add an egg to the top of most my meals if I could, so it is nice that I didn't need to place a special request.  My daughter had her usual cheese and bean burrito.  At Los Dos Molinos, it is called a burro.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The restaurant layout invite patrons to return during the warm, but not hot months of the year.  The doors were left open and there is a patio out back for dining and the consumption of alcohol.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place but alas, I didn't. the salsas were good and spicy. chips were eh, alright. I had the carnitas...tons of fat. I get it, pork is a fatty meat and it gives more flavor, but I think for 14.95, they could certainly have cleaned it up a bit. My beans had fat pieces in it too. Chewy and nasty when you don't expect it. My friend had the garlic pork. Flavorless and a small portion. My other friend had the Carne Adovada chimi. Christmas style. It was actually pretty good. Spicy red and green sauce, lots of heat. We had the chorizo dip. It was chorizo and a dollop of sour cream with 4 overcooked pita chips. So, here's the clincher. They give you a plate of meat that in the menu says...\"served with tortillaS \". Nope, you get 1. Just 1. It's 1.50 for an extra tortilla. Not a side, A tortilla. F' ing ridiculous. When we asked our server for another and he told us that it's extra, he followed it up by saying that they're homemade and hard to make so that's why they're extra. I won't go back for this very reason but then the manager came by and asked how everything was so we told him and he just nodded like he couldn't understand what we were saying. Right then, he could have saved us as customers. I believe in giving 2nd chances and I would've just tried the tacos but that manager just looked at us like he couldn't believe we wanted another 5inch tortilla. The service was decent enough but I wish servers would tell their names but it's not a deal breaker if they don't. Also, there's an extra charge for more chips and extra charge for more salsa. They overcharge for what they serve anyways so added charges for that stuff is ridiculous! So....ADIOS Los Dos, I will not be back.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch today.  Food was good (at least the portion that made it to me!), but when the server handed me my plate, he let go of it before I had it (he was reaching across the table from the other side) and he spilt the guacamole and sour cream onto my shirt and pants.  Thankfully I caught the rest of the plate before it all slid off.  He stood there for a moment looking at me and then just continued serving food and walked away as if nothing happened!  Thankfully the people I was with gave me some extra napkins they had.  Wiped it up as best I could and hopefully it'll come out in the laundry at home.  Needless to say I'm not impressed by the service.",
