She stayed on point with our orders and our checks. She did a great job keeping us stocked on mimosas! The food, as always, was super tasty. I had the Bliss Burrito w/chicken and it was amazing! Most of our party had either the egg sandwich (really super good) or different versions of the Mac & Cheese. No one left disappointed. We will go back for sure. Thanks Melissa for taking great care of us.",

I really like their naked  (read: healthier) cocktail menu. Just remember naked drinks = healthy. Naked food = plain. So their macaroni and cheese is not healthy, but delicious! Ha!  The ambiance is very charming and comfortable. reBAR has a great patio. The whole set up of Bliss/reBAR is great.",

Otherwise, this would have been a different review. Melissa (older hipster) was bartending and came over to take our orders. About 30 minutes later, she came over and asked us if she took our order. We told her that she did and reminded her of those orders. As soon as I mentioned my order, she remembered and said something about a computer glitch. She said she would put our order in again and would speed it up. She knew we were in a hurry.  At this time, people that came after us were getting their food. About 20 minutes later, we finally received our food and because we were starving we ate it less than 5-10 minutes.  She  told us that she would not charge for our drinks and gave us our bill. We had our bill ready right away and there was no one paying us any attention due to that every server walked past us without grabbing the bill. Finally, Melissa came by after about 10 minutes and grabbed our bill. We left with no one saying anything to us and no one thanking us for coming. Needless to say,  we will not be coming back.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for this place to open with super high hopes, and it looks like it will live up to expectations.  Bliss:  As Dave B said, we were only able to try a couple of appetizers, but they were delicious.  The coconut chicken is in a plum sauce, and was divine.  A full order of it would make a perfect meal, and at $7 isn't bad at ALL.  Almost all of the appetizers looked just as good.  The menu isn't terribly huge, which seems to be a growing trend.  Everything sounds good though; there are a few salads, two burgers, two mac and cheese options, and a couple of other entrees.  They all fell in the $8-$13(ish) range.    Finally, there are a couple of great looking desserts, and a Saturday and Sunday brunch of french toast, eggs, and the usual.  The place itself is such a great space... the majority of seating is outdoors on the patio, and indoors it's a very clean and modern feel but still bright and sunshiny.  As for the ReBar side, I really think it's going to be a hit.  The patio is one of the best views and best looking places downtown, and I'm guessing the inside bar will be the hot new place VERY soon.  It's got all the coolness of The Roosevelt, PLUS hard liquor in addition to beer and wine.  There were no tables or chairs yet, so I'm not sure what the vibe will be... it looks like it could be a low-lit swanky place with loud music and dancing, or it could turn into a more casual and comfortable hangout.  Either way, it looks like it's going to be just what I was hoping for... they'll have their own parking lot soon, so cross your fingers for Bliss/ReBar to become a destination restaurant of the sort we desperately need downtown.",

There is a huge tree with a bar surrounding it and various tables on the patio. Inside the bar has a great twig/branch decoration on the cieling. Pretty cool. Great for day drinking/great weather relaxing with a drink and hanging out with friends.  The service is great and the bartenders are friendly. During the week, they have daily drink specials for just $3 per drink. It was awesome. My girlfriend had some type of gummy bear drink the day we went and she really enjoyed it. It was on the drink of the day list. The crowd is pretty diverse there.",

The evening mild and the company superb, it would have taken a major misstep in service for Bliss to get anything less than 3 stars. Fortunately, the service was first rate. And having Hop Knot on tap certainly didn't hurt their resume.   I enjoyed the music and the atmosphere was inviting with a sense of community. While I didn't eat I did watch with jaw slightly agape as my tablemates snacked on hearty macaroni and cheese with bacon, coconut crusted chicken fingers and parm-dusted french fries with marinara dipping sauce. No shame in that game.  I'm looking forward to going back when it's a bit busier and I can get a better read on what's what. Oh, and I'll be dancing with those chicken fingers.",

I came here when it was Fate then 905 and I hope that this venue makes it. They've retained the cool outdoor bar and have fixed up the actual restaurant a tad.   They actually turned that other room into a nice indoor bar as well which I think is a nice touch. They were playing good tunes and the place was pretty packed. Drink prices were average:not cheap but not Scottsdale either. Service was not outstanding-a bit slow and uncoordinated but taking into account that this was their first night I'll happily write this off as cutting teeth.   The menu is limted-not much more than bar food, but it seems to have a fresh twist-didn't eat as I was too busy drinking. They have reverse happy hour after 9:00pm on Wednesdays so go check it out. the servers did make it clear that their specials are all a work in progress so go with that in mind. This is a local business and can hopefully revitalize the downtown area so please give these guys a shot. Definitely a step up from 905.",

I haven't tried the kitchen here, but the outdoor bar is thinly stocked with the standards and shows no signs of imagination. At least Nine|05 had a DJ - on my visit they were just pumping satellite radio.  For now, save your time. There are better places to go in the area.",

    "text": "I've been to this location many times in its previous incarnations as Fate and Nine05. A groupon gave me a reason to check out the new take. I really wanted to like but... I'm pretty sure I'll never be back.  I love the location. The new owners finally finished a re-model that was underway for years it seems. But the food... was just... not very great. The \"comfort cheese crisp\" appetizer ($8) we had with tomato, mozzarella, and pesto was pitiful. A large greasy chip with a tomato slice, a slice of mozzarella, and some pesto oil sprinkled over it. It was so greasy and frankly not very flavorful. I think a simple sprinkle of salt would have been a great improvement. (no salt on the table btw)  I followed it up with the \"veggie delight\" ($7) which the menu said was \"seasonal vegetables on a pretzel bun\" - more like a (fried?) patty of vegetables smothered with some sort of cheese spread? And one of the most inedible side salads (maybe it was a garnish I wasn't suppose to eat) I've ever encountered.  Overall I felt their printed menu was not very helpful in its descriptions or usability. I should have asked the waitress for clarification I guess.  The music was horrible. Loud upbeat generic electronic music with diva vocals and the like. I'm sure that works for some people but it just never will for me.  Three stars for the drinks - which were strong and tasty. I also appreciated that they had \"light\" mixed drinks to offer - even thought I didn't spring for one. And decent service.",

On my first visit, I ordered the Bliss burger and found the amount of cheese combined with the heaviness of the bun, really over powered the burger itself. So last night, I met a friend for dinner. I started out with a glass of their malbec. I was very impressed with the quality and smoothness of the malbec! We got some Parmesan garlic fries to share. They were just ok. I thought it was strange that they were served with marinara sauce. Next, I ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon and chicken. It came out piping hot and oozing with cheese. Normally I don't complain about the amount of cheese, but just like the burger I had, both dishes had way too much cheese in comparison the other ingredients. I did however enjoyed the slight spicy kick that the dish had.   I guess I would come here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

    "text": "Not a summer restaurant for Phoenix!!!! We went for happy hour on a day when it was still over 100 degrees. The open air kitchen means the chef is probably more comfortable, but the diners get to experience the heat from the ovens. The front of the restaurant faces west so we had the glaring sun shining into eyes until sundown and we could feel the heat radiating through the windows. We asked the waiter to draw the curtains and he told us they keep them up to maintain an \"open feel.\" To help cool the place down and get a cross breeze, someone had propped open the doors so we were swarmed with flies. One person in our group of four actually got up and left and said she'd rather stop at Burger King on the way home and eat in the park if she was going to have sweat through her dinner, have the sun in her eyes and swat flies while she ate. I should have left with her.   I went back at night on a cooler evening and the inside environment was much more pleasant.   Both times, the food was good and the portions are generous. Nothing worse than leaving a restaurant and having to resist the temptation to hit a drive through on the way home because your 'fancy' meal with trendy sized portions left you hungry.  The place is trendy and the wait staff is friendly.  The outdoor bar is wonderful for the few times a year you'd want to sit outside in the long AZ summer for a drink. I expect it will be great in the spring and fall weather.   I enjoyed the lettuce wraps (Swiss Chard, I learned is not a cheese, but rather a type of lettuce leaf), and the coconut chicken and the ginger sauce it comes with are great.  Good pours on the drinks!!!",

    "text": "I went to Bliss ReBAR the other day for the first time on my lunch break with a coworker. When we first walked in the place was totally dead, with only two tables being occupied. This made me a little nervous as lunch hour was hitting. My coworker and I decided to sit outside because the weather was so gorgeous and pretty soon we saw several groups walk in, which made me feel more at ease.  Within a minute, our waitress, Missy, appeared with waters. She seemed very sweet and told us she was the only person working. With the continued arriving guests, I was blown away that she was the only server and bartender, and the entire time maintained a calm but speedy presence.   I tried the drink of the day for $3. It was called the Pompeii and was essentially a cranberry vodka, but with a splash of soda water. It had good proportions and was a little summery with the sparkling water. Worth it for three bucks, but I wouldn't want to pay much more than that.  I was torn between a few things on the menu, including the tacos and the black bean burger but decided to opt for the veggie mac and cheese. I am so glad I made that choice. That was seriously the best mac and cheese I may have ever had. First, the cheese sauce was flavorful and had a wonderful texture. They also didn't go overboard; so even though I was totally indulging, I didn't feel like a complete glutton. It was also balanced out perfectly with the cooked broccoli, spinach, and tomatoes. They were all cooked perfectly, with the broccoli and spinach having just enough tenderness without losing the slight crispness of the raw form. The tomatoes were cooked just perfectly to bring a warm, roasted vibe. Last, but perhaps most important, the pasta itself was a great size macaroni (not too small, but retaining the familiarity of the childhood classic) and was cooked exactly right.  As for my coworker, he went for the grilled cheese, featuring bacon and the unusual add-in of apples. The bread was that warm golden color that immediately signals delicious, buttery, toasted slices. The cheese was oozing out enough to look devilish and it appeared the apples were roasted or sauteed in some way. If I ate meat, I would have absolutely insisted on having a bite. It looked so damn good. Also, a bonus, the salad on the side of spring mix leaves that were vibrantly fresh and lightly dressed.   I honestly cannot recommend trying Bliss reBAR enough. Hands down one of the best lunches I've had in a long time.",

The servers are pretty quick and our drinks are always full.    Every day they have a $3.00 cocktail drink and the happy hour specials are pretty inexpensive too.  So far the Mac & Cheese and the Meatloaf sandwich are really good.  I know I will be back to try more.    If you are ever in the Roosevelt district during First Friday or just in the area, you should try at Bliss Rebar.",

    "text": "This place is an epicenter for activity on First Fridays downtown.  During First Fridays the place is jam packed, the music is loud and the restaurant and outdoor patio is filled wall to wall.  I've been here twice for drinks, but never had their food.  So a group of friends and I decided to come here for what we heard was a solid weekend brunch.    Came here right at the opening on Saturday.  We were the first ones to arrive and there was only a smattering of other folks that came by.  Even though it was late morning, the music was playing almost as loud as I remember with a whole bunch of pop and dance chart hits booming from the speakers.  It was weird seeing it almost empty this time, but we were seated on the patio and tended to by a very friendly waiter.  The brunch menu has pretty decent selection and they have drink specials on brunch staples like mimosas, bloody marys, as well as huge assortment of martinis.  I went with a mild bloody mary (don't like em too spicy).  For my meal, I went with the french toast.  The french toast is actually on pretzel bread which gave it a more chewy texture.  Different, but good.  Didn't fall apart as easily as most french toast does either.  Got a side of eggs and hash browns.  Hit the spot on every note.  One of my friends got the chorizo burrito and loved it.  The rest of the table was plenty happy with their mimosas too.  All totaled, the french toast, eggs, hash browns, and bloody mary came out to $22 with tip on my bill.  Not bad for all the food that I got.  The patio area is very industrial but offers a nice view of people watching on 4th Street and for the most part is pretty well shaded.  I only took a brief glance at the indoor bar and restaurant areas, but both looked very modern and comfortable (as long as you're okay with the music volume).  I'll have to check out their typical lunch and dinner menu and report back on how that goes.  But if you're in the Roosevelt Row area looking for drinks or a good brunch, Bliss has just the thing for both.",

We went with another set of queer folk, and one thing I love about all these places is that there isn't any anti-gay rudeness that I've experienced in a good number of other places.  The menu is a bit sparse, and pretty much everything vegetarian (all 4 items) was fried, covered in cheese, or both, making for a not so healthy meal. That said, my eggplant/goat cheese sandwich was delicious (although I'm not sure about the iceberg lettuce and onion on it). The fries we ordered as a group? Mediocre. Would go with Delux's fries any day over these.  The rest of the group (the non-veggies) loved their meal (burgers and the fish), except my partner thought the pretzel bun was a bit off, and neither burger eater finished the bun.  They were not yet serving desserts, so I went for a drink. The waiter (Able, great with the service) suggested I try the naked (low calorie) Brooklyn Apple. I did, we all tasted it, and sent it back. It taste like fake sugar and fake apple flavor. However, the naked Vodka-rita was delicious.  Atmosphere? Loved it. Music? AH-MAY-ZING. Parking? Couldn't find it. Add a few more veggie options, and we'll definitely be back.",

Good nachos, and the pretzel bun is an excellent addition to their burgers and sandwiches.

The atmosphere is somewhat eclectic with part of the restaurant inside near a small partially open kitchen; the other side is a patio overlooking the street and side.  Either way the view is enough to satisfy your visit on its own.  The menu has several options including burgers, salads and breakfast (offered through the afternoon on Saturdays and Sundays).  We ordered a plate of fries as an appetizer.  An excellent choice.  The fries come with sea salt, vinegar, pepper and other assorted topping.  They are thin string fries, my favorite and cooked just right. I had ordered the Buddha burger.  This particular burger has a special sauce and vegetables that provide an Asian twist to an American favorite.  It was cooked to perfection and tasted even better.  My son decided to have the chicken and waffles.  This selection was the highlight of the visit.  The waffles were not over cooked or burnt.  They arrived with butter on top and maple syrup that appeared and tasted like it came directly from a maple tree in the Northeast.  The chicken was done in a breaded Japanese panko style with dipping sauce.  Delicious.  The cost per dish was around $10.00.  The delivery and preparation of the food needs to be recalibrated.  The orders were received one by one.  It appeared that the food was prepared in short bursts.  In other words, our appetizer arrived quickly, but we had to wait for the rest of our meal.  Once are meal was ready, it was ready alongside several other meals and it took some time to get into the waiter's hands.  It may have been due to understaffing?   All and all, I will be REVisting the REBar in the near future.....................",

What she got was 3 helpings of delicious mashed potatos, with a slab, not a slice, a slab of tender roast beef with mushroom gravy and fried onions on top each of the 'tater scoops.  This dish was something my mother, grandmother and all other double-X types in my family wish they could make.  I had one of their salads, which was excellent.

    "text": "I can't believe I am updating my review for Bliss/ReBar with a negative experience. The server/bartender (which I think was the problem, bartenders have so much to do that waiting on 16 or so people can get tricky) was initially very responsive to our table of 7, he got drink orders, food orders and then double checked with us on the food order. However as his section filled up, his service declined. He could have handled it better, but I think this one largely weighs as a management problem. This was the day of the Phoenix AIDS Walk, we beat the rush at Bliss, but they got busy quick! Why was the bartender also serving 16 or so people? A server, or the manager should have taken over the section.  Specific issues:   I got the Bliss Scramble, which I could swear I had before and it was great, this time it was essentially a Denny's chorizo omelet at twice the price. The 'toast' was something that Elwood would have enjoyed (re: dry, white, bread), the scramble was a flattened conglomeration of cheese, chorizo and egg (the menu said veggies too, but I couldn't find them) on top of hash browns that were nothing special.  My girlfriend got the Eggs Benedict, I quote: \"The worst Eggs Benedict I have ever had!\" It was supposed to be served on pretzel bread. The bread it was served on looked like it would be perfect for bruschetta. One of our friends got the french toast, which is also 'sliced pretzel bread' according to the menu. However, that was obviously pretzel bread, I had some, it was delicious. I didn't even feel inclined to try my girlfriend's poor little bruschetta breads sitting under their hood of egg and hollandaise. When Matt S, the bartender/server, came by with another round of food, we asked him why the meal was not as described, he said it was, that was the pretzel bread. Even though we had an example of pretzel bread sitting on the table. A helpful guy who'd only been there a week, went to check with the kitchen for us and came back to let us know that pretzel bread and pretzel buns were different. We thanked him for that info, as another friend had a pretzel bun sitting on her plate and yes it was different from the pretzel bread that was made into french toast, and it was quite different from the sad little slices that were looking for light under their egg roof. The amount of egg on the Benedict was startlingly small as well, especially for a place that I usually feel has over-sized portions, everyone's portions (including my homely omelet) were superior to the Benedict. Which means that yes, the bread was even smaller than the small serving of eggs.  Matt was also wrong about two eggs that he brought us, he stood there at the table with them asking who ordered them, we said no one and he put them down and left.  My scramble came well after everyone else had started eating, perhaps a reason it was so blah? I added one of the mystery eggs  to my scramble to make it at least somewhat interesting. Never, not once did Matt ask us if we needed ketchup, sriracha or anything like that. The few times he swooped by, it seemed he was trying to not make eye contact. (Probably because of the non-pretzel bread).  We received a bill with errors and a few unhappy looks. Then we headed out to continue our day wondering if we should get some more, and better food at Squash Blossom next time...  I am sorely disappointed in Bliss' brunch this day, and saddened by this, I used to be able to recommend this place without reservations as an excellent brunch and dinner venue (I have never been for lunch). Now, if asked where to go...I'd probably have to say The Welcome Diner, Squash Blossom, or Denny's if you want a chorizo omelet, dry toast, and hash browns.",

    "text": "I came here for the 2nd Back to Drinking UYE. I like this place. It is very laid back. I like how it is split into two different parts. The restaurant on one side in it's own building and the bar on the other in it's own building with outdoor seating in between. It is in a very arty neighborhood downtown. Almost looks like a house that was converted. My girlfriend and I split the Bliss Nachos and the Steakhouse Burger. The Nachos were very good with the homemade tortilla chips, queso fresco, pickled jalapenos, tomatoes and red cabbage. We also add chicken to them. The chips were very good. Airy and light. The cheese covered everything. It all worked very well together. The Steakhouse Burger was really good too. it has lettuce, tomato, blue cheese, bacon, steak sauce & crispy onions on toasted pretzel bun. The pretzel bun is so good. The burger was cooked just right. I didn't notice there was blue cheese on it when it was ordered and was wondering what that odd taste was. I am not a fan of blue cheese and if I got this burger again it would be minus the blue cheese. It was still very good in spite of my blue cheese oversight. I would also like to come back here to try their weekend brunch some time. Perhaps a certain breakfast UYE could pick this place once. I will say the parking situation is a little crazy but spots can be found. I will definitely be back to try out more drinks and more food. Bliss ReBAR has been added to my list of cool bars to hang out in.",

The vodka taste was overpowering, and really distracted from what I thought the drink flavor should have focused on, the dream! :) More specifically, the dream is to get a buzz without really noticing the alcohol :D   The sonoran bliss dog was great, however, which was also recommended by the server...so kudos! Thanks for helping me decide between the sonoran and the BBQ. I probably will go back for the BBQ bliss dog, the apple coleslaw just sounded too interesting.",

We attended a party here that was outside, and one of the bartenders mentioned that if the inside opened up they would try to accommodate us. A few tables opened up inside and our group sat at the tables. More people started to show up, so a bartender mentioned that there was room in the other restaurant. She went over to move tables together for us. She was very helpful and attentive. When our group moved over to the area she put together for us, I went out to smoke. I overheard one of the servers complaining to the hostess saying, \"They should not be in there.\" I don't care if your upset over a group of people that you have to wait for, but that can be said in the back away from patrons in earshot. It was very rude. Thank you to the staff that was friendly and helpful!",

Bartender pored them out still charged almost $20 and kicked us out. Also they straight bashed my friends. If you want to enjoy yourself and you are gay i recommend the local kkk rally. They will show you more respect. Prices are high and staff is rude. Been too biker bars in the south that where more. Female bar back ok guys prideful and rude at first meet.

I don't know if this building was something else before (though I definitely get that impression), either way it's a beautiful building.  Service has been fine.  The first time I simply don't recall, so nothing notable. The second time was kind of mixed.  We made reservations for New Year's Day.  Upon arrival we were told to sit anywhere.  That seemed weird; clearly our reservation was irrelevant (that noted, it seemed similarly unnecessary the first time, though we still \"checked-in\"). Beyond that, there weren't even tables available for the party -- fortunately, one couple ended up being absent for brunch.  It then took quite a while for our order to be taken.  Once that happened, service was good, if not great.  Our table was well tended and there were multiple wait staff who checked in on us; some were especially friendly, in the good way.  The cost is good.  The food is good.  I would say both are in step with each other.  It's not super cheap, but neither is the food.  You pay for what you get, and you definitely don't overpay, which I appreciate.  They also have an interesting selection of items on their menu (e.g. breakfast nachos), with options for everyone in the rainbow of selective eaters.  We'll definitely keep this establishment in mind, and maybe we'll give it a shot for drinks or something else next time.",

Bliss Rebar looked small with large mirrors inside to make it look more roomier.   Appetizer: Cheesy Mac Balls. This is a good comfort food and can easily order another one.   I really wanted to try the Black Bean Burger but they were out! So I ended up getting their 4th Street Tacos which comes with 3 small tortillas filled with chicken, onions, queso, lime, cilantro and all the good stuff  and chipotle sauce. This dish is something I could put together but was still good. Not the best. If only!! I had gotten the black bean burger.   Sweets: Bliss Brownie a la mode topped with a strawberry and a couple blackberries. Ehh it was more like the bottom edges of the brownie was literally stuck to the ramekin and had to put so much force of the spoon to etch off the ramekin. Lots of arm work to eat this one.   Service was mediocre. We didn't get a refill of water until we asked for it. It was a self service for some ketchup for a friends fries.   And the check was a jumbled up.",

    "text": "So, I read great reviews for this place, so I decided to take some friends who were visiting from out of town on a Sunday for brunch.  The drinks are not great, but they are not the worst, we had \"group therapy\" which is some fruity drink served in a big glass to share; it wasn't strong, it wasn't savory, it was bleh. After that, I ordered a red chili margarita...that was disgusting...I just chugged it because I didn't want it to go to waste. After trying those drinks, and not being impressed, we decided to stick to mimosas, those never disappoint, and they are decently priced, you get 4 mimosas from 1 bottle of champagne.   Food came, I ordered the breakfast nachos, and I was delighted with the mixture of flavors, it had scrambled eggs w/ chorizo, and the tortilla chips were flour, not corn like nachos usually are, they were good thou. The portion was very decent.  My boyfriend ordered their french toast, which is some huge bread that looks like balls, but it was delicious.  One of our friends had the big ass burrito (my friend ordered it because the menu said it was a big ass burrito, and it wasn't). However, he said the flavor was good, I tried his rosemary Parmesan fries and they were tasty.   My other friend had a regular chicken sandwich, and well, that was a BIG ASS sandwich, she ordered avocado on the side...and of course, they forgot it. She said the sandwich was really good regardless, it had some type of marmalade that made it look very appealing.  We had around 5 bottles of champagne, the guys had a few beers, bill came up to $200.00, a bit pricey, but again, we did drink a lot.  One last thing, I didn't know this was a gay bar...or just Sunday's maybe? so, just letting you know so you're not surprised like us. They have a DJ that starts playing some electro music at around 2pm by the bar outside, all gay people. It was fun.",

We were seated next door for dinner and they were very understaffed. There was only 1 server on a busy Saturday night with about 5 tables full.   Sara Jane was our server and she did such an excellent job accommodating us and the other guests without showing frustration. A party of 15 arrived after we had already been served our meal and she still checked up on us frequently and made sure we were okay.   My cousins chicken came out a bit raw and she accommodated her meal without hesitation. I ordered the pretzel bread and meaty Mac and cheese and both were very delicious!   Our service was excellent! We went next door for drinks afterwards and had a great time!",

I came here with a couple of girls on a Saturday night and made reservations but didn't need to because it wasn't as crowded. They have a Dj that Saturday night which made it even better because they placed r and b and hip-hop (old school hip-hop) which made it cool! The whole ambience is great! I did enjoy my food, their Atlantic salmon was so yummy and their Thai shrimp for appetizer was so tasty!! I didn't enjoy their Mac and cheese balls, I thought it wasn't as cheesy. I also didn't enjoy their sangria (red) but I did enjoy their other drinks.  If you're looking for a quiet date night, I'd find a different place because this place caters more to groups and couples that are willing to listen and enjoy their night with music!",

Our Airbnb host had recommended it to us and we knew it was LGBT friendly so we decided to go. It was worth the stop. Street parking was easy to find. The staff was very welcoming and friendly and the service was fast. We ate outside on the patio, which I would definitely recommend. Being the Midwesterners we are, we ordered the green chili pork poutine, which I would highly recommend. I had to drive so I didn't have alcohol, but the options on the alcohol menu were definitely tempting. If you are looking for a place to grab a bite or have a few cocktails on an outdoor patio, I would highly recommend stopping here.",

The happy hour Smirnoff martini's left a lot to be desired. They tasted like poorly mixed, warm, watered down vodka drinks.   The happy hour menu was pretty decent but figuring out what they offered was like pulling teeth. They apparently replaced the happy hour menu awhile back and have yet to reprint a new one and even worse educate their waiters on what the hell is included on the non-existent happy hour menu. When asked what the happy hour menu included our waitress was unsure, pointed at the appetizer menu and said \"it includes some of these but not all of them and has some things that aren't listed. Ask me if you don't see see something or want to know if it is part of the happy hour.\" Uhm, ok, I'll be sure to ask about what may or may not be part of the happy hour. After what was supposed to be a martinis, the four of us switched to beers and enjoyed our food.",

My friends and I sat near the outdoor bar, and the bartender/waiters ignored us.  I had to approach someone and ask them to come and serve us.  There were only about five other patrons on the patio so I am not sure why we were being ignored.  We ordered dinner and drinks-the drinks came quickly, which was great.  Our food was quite awful when it arrived.  Parmesan chicken pasta was flabby and tasteless, according to my friends.  My pot roast had zero flavor and was stringy and grisly, and the mashed potatoes tasted watery.  The only person at the table that wasn't unhappy with their food had the little sliders.  Very disappointing.",

After our order was placed; there was about 10-15 of us there; half the group received their drinks (i was not a part of that group) & b4 I knew it one of our group toasts but yet half of us don't have drinks b/c we weren't served all at the same time.  The 2nd half of our drinks arrived 5 min later. I'm in the service industry & the service came across as lackadaisical at best.  The food was great though.

He said \"what's Sierra Nevada?, is that a beer?\"    Where the hell did they find this server?  Are you serious?  How do you not know what Sierra Nevada is??    He goes to the bar to ask what it is, he comes back and says \"its a brown ale, like octoberfest\"  I ask: \"Is it Tumble?\"  He says, \"oh yeah, thats what they called it.\"  Ok, how the hell do you forget the name of the beer from the bar to my table, its like 20 feet!  This server is the dumbest thing ever...  I hope this kid falls face first into the fryer.     Then we ask him how a few things are:  He says, \"the burger is ok, thats my style.\"  Then he proceeds to tell me \"Well, i sold a lot of this, and a lot of that.\"  Look sparky, i didnt ask how sales were, i want to know whats good.  If a parade of fools came in and ordered 200 poopwiches, that makes them a good seller, still doesnt make them good!  CaPish?   I ordered the Veggie Sandwich... The eggplant was soggy, the bread was burnt (see my pic)...  the carrot slaw was SO covered in garlic crap, that it was not edible.  I didnt even eat a quarter of the food.  They cleared the plate without even asking how it was.    Seriously... i cannot fathom ever going back to this place.  I wish i could give this less than 1 star.... it deserves  a -5.  Epic Fail.",

My girlfriend had some berry inspired drink off of the \"naked\" portion of the menu and it was totally undrinkable.  It was filled with huge chunks of unripe muddles berries and tasted just awful.  The staff was nice enough to remove it from our tab.  We shared a shrimp BLT and a hummus appetizer. They were both pretty tasty. We would have preferred more veggies with the hummus but I really enjoyed the sandwich.  Overall it was pretty good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it back here and with the amount of business we found there on a Saturday night, I wouldn't expect it to be there much longer.",

But today, my husband and I went for Saturday late lunch and we sat inside b/c it's been freezing lately. Anyway, my only complaint is that my side salad had rotten leaves. You know how the purple leaves always rot first when you by the salad mixes and then their gunk gets on all the other stuff? That was the case.  I tried picking through it to eat the pieces that weren't rotten but decided it was not worth the trouble.    Either they don't pay enough attention or don't care enough about what comes out of their kitchen - regardless I just find it disappointing.  Everything else was fine-- well besides the troglodytes yelling at the too-loud Cardinal's game on TV.",

Then I shared a caesar salad and a bliss burger, loaded.  I particularly enjoyed the burger.  The bottom line is that I really love the outdoor space here for the nice weather - outdoor dining and relaxing at it's best.",

I'm not a prude but there are only so many times that you can drop the \"F\" bomb when if becomes ineffective and just plain crass. She was apparently an employee (I saw her busing some tables on the patio) then returned to the bar to enlighten everyone in the entire place on her sex life, work life, and oh so much more.  The two bartenders seemed mortified but never said a word.  The poor single man ended up going outside in the 114 degree heat if that tells you how bad it was.    Drink was fine, appetizer was mediocre- guests/employees at the bar were a nightmare and we will not be back.",

    "text": "I would say that this place is deserving of a good, solid 4 stars. It really didn't blow me away, but it was much better than most places for sure.  First, I must say that my family and I are huge fans of Chef Johnny Chu and used to frequent the restaurant \"Fate,\" which used to be located in what is now Bliss ReBAR. However, I believe a few years ago another company bought out Fate and turned it into something else which is obviously no longer there, and for good reason -- I went there once but it was just not the same experience. It was a very watered down version of what Fate had used to be. I'm truly glad that something good has come of this once-quaint little house in downtown Phoenix!  The staff was very friendly, the atmosphere lovely, and the place still has its charms. The food and drinks were decently priced and delicious. We all had breakfast items, I believe, since it was a late Sunday morning brunch for us. We were able to come right in and sit down immediately as it wasn't too busy. They also had some drink deals for Sunday morning, including a really good, spicy Bloody Mary. It was decently strong, too!   I had the French Toast with Pretzel Bread; I usually hate French Toast, but it was very delicious here. The bacon was good too. My husband shared it with me, and I had some of his omelet which was also delicious. We also shared an order of the coconut chicken strips with the rest of the table. I believe someone wanted to have a fancy version of chicken and waffles for breakfast! :) These were very good as well. I was also able to try some breakfast nachos and was happy with those as well.  Our server was very endearing. He was very friendly and helpful, and it seemed like the other staff members were as well. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience, and I would dine here again. :)",

I have been going and in love with Bliss since. I've always loved the outside bar. Last week my friends had their dinner club party there. Awesomeness that I was invited. As I was just there to celebrate my company's agreement passing hosted by Bliss! I took my then new-ish boyfriend to 'haze' him, if you will to my flight attendant world. He fit right in and loved Bliss too. I particularly love Bliss nachos. Scott loves Bliss Mac&Cheese Balls. We may have ordered two orders that party night. Too many strong Ketel drinks make it all hazy!  Last week at dinner club I had the street tacos. Amazing. A few of us shared the hummus plate and again, the nachos with chicken. Several drinks. I actually had the waiter bring me seltzer to soften the strong of my vodka drink! Where does that ever happen! My boyfriend had the mac&cheese entree this time. Holy heaven. I even tasted it. Yum. The only thing we disliked. The panna cotta. On the menu it stated it was with marcerated berries. It came with kiwi fruit and it was too hard to be called 'panna cotta'. Which is an italian cream that is cooked just until it becomes a bit thick and congealed just a little less than the consistency of a custard. This was beyond jello as we have in the US. So the waiter took it away and off our bill with no question. He was gracious and nothing but sweet.  I would not ever rate Bliss less than a 5 because so many things about Bliss are above par. All of our friends desserts and meals were raved about. It's a super trendy, fun and hip place. Great people watching! Awesome Sunday brunch too!!!",

    "text": "I have visited Bliss ReBAR twice now and have enjoyed both visits in their own unique way.  My first visit was as a date night with my husband. Delicious street tacos and he had the mac and cheese. The sangria was excellent and the patio was delightful. I liked how the restaurant was separate from the bar and one didn't intrude upon the other. It was a nice atmosphere, service was prompt and food was served at just the right temps.   My second visit was an entirely different experience. Not to say it was bad...just different. I went with a friend before we went to the Bette Midler show which was on a Sunday evening. I made reservations online via their website. We showed up and the restaurant side of the business was closed, blocked off, and appeared to have been that way for some time. My friend and I looked at each other and headed over to the bar side to get an explanation. We stood there for a while at the entrance because the sign at the outside hostess stand said to come inside the bar. So we went back outside, stood by the hostess stand and suddenly the hostess appeared. She seated us inside the bar at a table. We were greeted promptly and handed menus. The bar was pretty full for 5PM on a Sunday and when the waiter returned I asked him about the restaurant side being closed. He explained that the restaurant side closes down on Sundays after 3PM. I mentioned that the website didn't say anything about that and I was surprised that they would take a reservation for dinner when the restaurant is technically closed. He said that the kitchen is open with all the same food--they just close the restaurant side in order to keep the electrical bill down. Ok...makes sense. We ordered, got our food, and all was fine. Just as good of an eating experience as the previous time but with a more colorful crowd. Bliss ReBAR seems to be a haven for gay men which is totally fine with me, but if you have a problem with that, Bliss isn't the place for you. My friend and I had a great time and the other patrons were fun, interesting, and made for great dining companions.   I will definitely go back to Bliss and am already looking forward to having those tasty street tacos again!",

They are lucky to have someone so warm and gracious he can turn a bad situation around with a smile. He is clearly great at his job and enjoys it",

The Third was a party for one of my colleagues, another dinner party, and last night was my 5th with a couple of friends.  It was their first time there, so they ordered most of the comfort foods like the Mac & Cheese bacon, coconut chicken, skewers, etc.  I went back to eating vegetarian foods again, so I ended up getting their Roasted Pepper soup special and Mozzarella, Tomato and Pesto cheese crisp.  Although I wasn't a fan of the soup, I was satisfied with the cheese crisp. I was also pleasantly surprised that the waitress removed the soup from our bill. I wasn't expecting that, and I thought that was sweet.  I seem to always have a good time here, so I can't say anything bad about this place. Without a doubt, this is my fail safe place to bring friends and family to dine when they are in town. I also highly recommend it if you want to throw a party here.",

Its located In a great area. It's very diverse. The waiters are awesome, friendly, outgoing and amazing. The champagne bottles are $12 until 3PM on weekends. They have great appetizers. My favorite is always the bomb nachos. I can come here over and over again every weekend if I can. It's not that far from anything in Downtown. It is surrounded by other places but this is the place to choose. You can eat inside or outdoors . It has two places to sit inside and two sides. It's really huge. Settle for Bliss Rebar! You will not regret it at all.",

    "text": "\"Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.\"  Ron Swanson, Parks and Recreation  Rich women?  Diets!?  That's why I had a Bloody Mary with lunch.  #WerkBitch  Strolled in for a lunch date with four guys because I'm a pimp and boy were things hot!  It was 111F outside and it felt about 90F inside.  Ick!  Anyways, it seemed like a slow day inside the bar area which was great since there was only one or two people working.  Drinks were ordered, food was ordered, and a lot of waiting ensued.    I'm the type that like to sip at a drink throughout my meal but the wait was so long that I was staring down an empty glass, olives eaten, before my macaroni and cheese was out.  The food was delicious.  Cheesy gooey goodness!  I had ordered another drink to go with my meal after Tom D. tempted me... that seducer!  I ordered a Strawberries & Champagne and what I got was a super flat Shirley Temple.  Where's the bubbles?  The champagne!?  I couldn't even taste the vodka.  After a few tiny sips, I abandoned it.  Tom had it sent back since I wasn't feeling it and it was taken off my bill.  One of our lunch companions also received the wrong order and had to endure another torturous wait before getting his sandwich.  I had originally wanted to try the creme brulee but with our meal quickly approaching the two-hour mark, it just wasn't worth it.  And so we left!  Service was so-so.  Granted, there was only one True worker but they should hire at least one other person to help. The food was delicious but the cocktails were a let-down [did our Bloody Marys even have vodka in it!?].   I was digging the Lana del Rey tunes though and the ambiance was nice.  Also, please turn on that A/C.  It's the desert!  My make-up was melting!   Bliss is more on the 3.5 stars side.",

I ended up here on a Sunday around noon after two other downtown brunch spots didn't work out. There were two in our group who come here often & they said there would be no wait, & they were right! There were 5 of us & we got a table inside immediately. The waitress was friends with the two frequenters so it made the service even better! I don't remember what there menu was like before, but I was pleasantly surprised by all the options! I had no idea they were such a great spot for brunch & lunch! I ordered a classic egg breakfast + a pancake. It was really good, & I know my breakfast food! I got to sample everything everyone else ordered too & it was all delicious! I'll definitely be back sooner than later! I want to try other dishes they have. & the ease of getting in midday on a weekend is super hard to find downtown these days.",

Our first round was actually something different than what it was supposed to be, but we didn't know until another server pointed it out and comped us for the initial \"mistake,\" so that was either a plus or a minus, depending on how you look at it.

I ordered a different meal from the last time because I had heard great things..........well it was not pleasing to me at all. My waitress doubled around and I told her and requested to order something else, well this is when the indecency occurred. She had the nerve to tell me she could get me something else but I'd have to pay for both dishes, of course my face was overtaken by a blank stare, she then proceeded to go back and forth with me so I asked for the manager. Well this muscle bound no customer service or quality of branding idiot came over and repeated the same thing, then proceeded to tell me how he's never worked at a restaurant where this wasn't protocol, I was ready and equipped to bane plenty, better quality establishments and some lacking,  I told him I would not pay for it, but would pay for my drinks, obviously those can't be taken back. I asked for the updated bill, he brought me the full bill, I politely left the cost of my drinks plus tax and exit stage left. He followed my fiance and I out and began to take pictures of our plates, we politely stopped to give him time. To whomever the owner is, I would highly suggest some personable and customer service skills training for your employees lack thereof IMMEDIATELY. I have never been treated so poorly, never had an establishment not even attempt to rectify the issue and then be so bold to  follow me outside. The sad thing is you never know who you're dealing with or who they know. Todd be surprise just how fast bad publicity and word of mouth can spread. I will never find my way back to this establishment, not because of the ambiance or the food, but strictly because of the service and employees. My LGBT community will definitely be hearing about this, I have very strong ties to the very same community you serve!!!!",

I ordered a burger and she ordered quinoa salmon. I love this place however our server didn't ask me what I wanted for a side and upcharged me for rosemary fries, which I didn't even touch because I don't like rosemary. I am not one to complain so I paid and just wanted to let every know. The food here is amazing, our server was a bit slow but I think she was the only one taking care of all of the tables outside. We would def. go back again!",

    "text": "Let me preface this by stating that both instances that I've had Bliss' food it has been delivered by a local service. This review does not reflect on said service in any way.   The first time I had Bliss' food I found it very tasty. The experience consisted of a Caesar salad and the meaty mac and cheese with sriracha added per numerous reviews. The Caesar was crisp, the croutons full of flavor, and the dressing spot on. The mac and cheese was hearty. Period. And I like that. That was a 4-star experience.   The latest encounter consisted of the spicy Caesar, two shrimp BLTAs, one with pretzel bread, again, per numerous yelp recommendations, and two sides of fries - one was rosemary/Parmesan and the other was the traditional salt and pepper. The spicy Caesar is the regular Caesar with sriracha added. We figured we'd give it a shot, though I now know sriracha and Caesar aren't meant to mix. I love to try new things so that's not the complaint. There was nary a crouton to be found. The menu says they come with it, so they should be there. The shrimp BLTAs lacked the fundamental component in anything marked with 'BLT' - the bacon! They were completely bland so it makes me wonder how much the bacon would've helped anyway. If they can't stand on their own without the bacon, then perhaps they need to be rethought. Now the fries. The order showed up within 30 minutes of having been placed, but the fries tasted, felt, and looked like they'd been under a hot lamp for hours. They were dry, hard, and utterly uninviting. In other words, not worth the time or money.   Perhaps the last experience was a seriously 'off' day for them, but my feeling is that whoever sent that food out the door couldn't have cared less.",

    "text": "I had heard about this place quite often on Yelp, and since I had today off of work, I grabbed some friends and we went down to DTPHX for dinner. We arrived around 6pm and saw that the bar was happenin' with the happy hour crowd. I really like the layout of the bar/restaurant, and they had a DJ over on the bar side and I will likely come back in the future just for that.   We made a left and headed over to the restaurant and were told to have a seat wherever we wanted. The deco is simple and sleek. I had perused the menu before hand so it was easy making a decision, though there are a lot of great sounding options. I got an order of the parmesan fries to share, and I had the Bliss Burger Loaded. The fries were tasty, but I think I have an aversion to shoestring fries, as I probably would have enjoyed them a little thicker. Plus I really wanted ketchup instead of the marinara they served with it.   I didn't know that the Bliss Burger came on their famous pretzel bun, so was surprised when that came out. Not that I don't love pretzel buns, but because my last pretzel bun experience was a bad one (Daily Dose), but not only was this sandwich huge, the pretzel bun was fantastic. My friends got the chicken bbq burger and turkey burger, and they were both impressed as well. We all agreed that we would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "As a full time traveler, I eat at a lot of restaurants so it takes something truly special to earn a five-star rating in my book.  Bliss/reBAR did just that today.  The crowd spilling out on the sidewalk, on a Sunday afternoon, was our first clue the restaurant would be good.  A friendly staff greeted us at the door and seated us immediately.  The menu looked like comfort food gone wild.  Everything was tempting so choosing was difficult.  Thanks to Jim, our exceptionally helpful waiter, we selected two of the house specialties and split them between us -- we were both hungry and still couldn't finish everything.  We had the Mac n Cheese, with Chicken and Bacon and also Mama's Pot Roast dinner.    The pot roast was exceptionally tender and served over a flavorful cauliflower mashed; this was accompanied by done-just-perfect asparagus.  The mac n cheese was out of this world.  Unlike most we've tried, the cheese in this dish was ultra light and creamy.  Adding a generous portion of chicken (and just enough bacon) made this dish a real delight.  Add in a fabulous mimosa deal on Sunday and this meal was perfect.  Although we're only in the Valley for a few months, we'll be heading back to Bliss/reBAR often (and bringing our friends as well!).    We learned from Chef Eric they make their own cheese sause for the mac n cheese...perhaps he'll share that recipe with us on our next visit!",

He told us about the special for the night (which he had to repeat because I was checking in, not listening lol) which was a blueberry vodka and ciroc with lemon juice for $3, or a tall for $1 more. I had the tall, obviously.  Tasted like a slurpie! The girl asked for a strawberry banana drink, which he made perfect for her, not too sweet. We sat outside in this couch area. It was cool, but the thing that initially drew us to it was the privacy, which was gone when the motion detector light came on with the light of 1000 suns. It turned off a few minutes later though and all was good. Overall great experience. Will definitely be back.",

I finally had to just start clearing the table myself by bringing our used glasses to the bar. Secondly do not open a tab at the bar. The bartender on duty, a gentleman with earlobes that were large from a circular piercing, added his friend's drinks to my tab. I went to the bar to pay the bill and he hands me a credit card charge for $75.00. I asked for the itemized receipt and he reluctantly gave it to me. When I told him I hadn't had any absolute drinks he immediately took them off without question. Clearly he thought I was too drunk to notice and thought he could scam me. What a terrible business practice. Beware when you go here! Also it was very disappointing that the DJ stopped playing at midnight.",

I had the Bliss Burger with their house cheese (the pretzel bun was perfect...not too hard...not too soft)  - definitely try the parmesan fries. My colleague had the turkey burger and commented to the server that it is one of the best that he has had. He also mentioned that others have told him that the Mac and Cheese is really good.

I've been on a Monday, a Tuesday, probably a Friday or two, likely Saturday and definitely a Sunday. Heck, lets just throw in Wednesday and Thursday for good measure.  It's the type of neighborhood bar where every one knows your name, as long as you happen to know everybody who's there that is. One of the best Macaroni and Cheeses in town - the best? perhaps, you should judge them on that one for yourself. The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are poured 'well' ;-), the food always comes out tasty, and the friends are always here. What else could you really need?  I wouldn't exactly call this a dance venue, but there's generally always dance music playing in the bar and on the patio over the weekends; I've seen some people get down. They've got a cool patio for brunch when it's nice outside, an interesting outdoor bar with heat lamps for those chilled \"winter\" evenings, and indoor dining in the bar as well as the restaurant.  FYI, this is a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), so if you're looking to pickup on the opposite sex, you might have some trouble with that here, but it's a great spot for gathering with your friends.

The wife and I got there about 8ish to grab a bite which is late for us so I wanted something on the lighter side. I didn't want a salad but i saw the Asian wrap with chicken which sounded really good. When it came it was lettuce wraps and not a sandwich type of wrap which makes sense because it was on the appetizer menu. Needless to say it was awesome and enough for a full meal. It paired well with my $3 PBR. It was a bit messy but it was good anyway. I would go back again when I'm in the area.",

We had gone in because we wanted to just have a quick drink & coincidentally, it was about 8 minutes after Happy Hour had started (on a Saturday too which you don't find a lot of the time!). The bartender was really nice and listed off the items on the HH menu - we went with the house special for the day, the Rasputin. It was absolutely delicious & refreshing, especially in the Phoenix heat! It wasn't busy the day we had gone in but the waiters were telling us it's normally very busy. We're planning on going back one night when they have live music!",

Two for Tuesdays and getting yummy burgers served on pretzel bread with a plate of fries and my choice of beer or wine is a great deal. The mac n' cheese is yummy too and dare I say better than my own husbands.  The cheese crisp is more like oversized nachos, but still good.  Everything I have ordered has been perfectly delicious. I have always had wonderful and friendly service. I agree this is no place to sit on the patio during the sweaty summer months and the music is a bit bland and too top 40, but I enjoy the yummy food and boozy drinks.

I spent most of my time outside and at the bar. The decor is really something, and there's lots of room inside and out for you to walk around and mingle with people. The staff is very friendly, and all around it's a really cool place! The drinks and apps are amazing, and $4 Long Islands on Thursdays are right up my ally!   My only complaint is parking. There's, like, 4 empty lots around this place, but parking is across the busiest street in this hidden abandoned parking lot. I gave up trying to figure out how to get there, so I ended up parking down a ways on the street (which is packed around the bar/restaurant).  I'd give it 4 stars if it was just easier to park somewhere (maybe buy part of that huge lot in front and turn it into parking spots?!)",

    "text": "A new player in the Downtown Phoenix food scene, Bliss is a creation by the folks behind the Fez, Switch, and Ticoz empire. They occupy a buliding once occupied by Fate and Nine|05, the former of which was one of my favorite restaurants.  Entering the restaurant, we were greeted with an odor of mildew and dirty water, which isn't exactly a pleasant way to arrive into an establishment. Being the only ones seated in the small space, we were able to really examine it, and I noticed one glaring difference between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up; it feels like a cafeteria. The installation of florescent lights, heat lamps, and massive amounts of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school. Whatever, we can deal with it. An overview of the menu showed several options which seemed like drunk food... fried everything, cheese crisps, foot long hot dogs, slider burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, etc. Apparently \"comfort food\" means deap fried grease? NO THANKS. I ordered the Braised Beef Tacos, which had the consistency of paste, but were average in taste.   My biggest gripe with this place is the microwave (not even a turbo chef) sitting front and center in the kitchen. Look, I understand that some restaurants use microwaves (usually not good ones) in their kitchen, especially if it's a cold kitchen (which this isn't) but having it in plain view and audible in the dining room is just atrocious. I truly hope someone from the restaurant reads this and hides the thing. It made me completely lose my appetite when I saw them heating my girlfriend's rice for her chicken skewers in the microwave. yuck. She did mention she was neutral about her food. We are people who go out at least once a day for a meal and try a new place every time, so we know food.   Everyone we encountered was nice, and the service was very friendly. Everyone seemed interested in how well we enjoyed our meal, the space, and they seemed interested in welcoming us back. Unfortunately, the place looks kind of makeshift on the ReBar side, and like a cafeteria on the Bliss side. I'm not really sure why it looks makeshift, perhaps it is just because it looks like a temporary wall in the back of the room, or because it looks so bare, but it looks like they are in there just for the time being.   I feel compelled to go here again but only for drinks out on the patio. The inside looks like Mexico, the food wasn't very good, and the cafeteria/microwave issues pretty much summed up this is not a place for a nice night out dining.  I also find it interesting how many reviews are by orange heads or people who were here for the \"vip opening.\" c'mon, try the place before you write a public review of it, and by try I mean eat some food, and actually experience it.",

    "text": "We made two trips to Bliss/reBar. The first time.. we sat at a table for 20 minutes, I kid you not, and no one came by. Apparently the new hostess forgot to assign us a server. We left and I wrote them an email. The owner was nice enough to invite us back and offer complimentary drinks and appetizer. I figured, why not?  We get there and am pleased that our server is pleasant (probably the best experience about this place). We ordered a ruby grapefruit martini and an orange-cicle to start with. The drinks were strong but I'd never shell out $10 for something that small and plain.   Appetizer: chicken lettuce wraps. The lettuce wraps were covered in too much sauce and really looked like a PF Changs rip-off. Didn't taste too great. Too runny and too salty.  The boy ordered beef nachos and I had the 'loaded' macaroni and cheese. The nachos are deep fried, but the cheese is too milky and doesn't have any kick. The beef wasn't cooked in any spices, tasted like they just threw it on the pan. SO plain. The macaroni and cheese? Welp, I got it without bacon.. and it looked like it was out of an instant box with some store-bought powder bread crumbs on top. Way too milky and runny.. tasted bland. Mac and cheese needs to be rich, thick, cheesy. This didn't make the cut. I sent it back after a few bites and decided not to get anything else. Experience over.  We're never coming back. Although the service was better the second time around, the food is overpriced and bland. Thanks, but no thanks.",

As I walk up I notice the host podium is vacant and walk to the front door of the restaurant and find myself holding the door open for 2 of the servers as they were walking out with food and I continue to walk in looking confused on who I tell I am here so I can sit and be served.  One of the servers came back in, and I asked if we just seat ourselves to which he advised that I could find a spot I like and he would follow me.   After some though I ordered the loaded burger and the shoestring fries with sea salt and vinegar. While not fond of the cheese sauce, it was good, but I would have been more content with a slice of sharp cheddar or crumbles of bleu cheese. The bacon was crisp and generous and the patty (cooked medium) was thick and juicy. Like everyone else has mentioned, the pretzel bun on the burger was great.  I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the sriracha slaw provided with the burger enough to put some on the burger itself.   The fries were nice and thin...where was the vinegar? Ehhh, not in the mood to bring it to their attention I enjoyed them with just the sea salt.   The portions are generous as I found myself taking half my burger home and more than half of my fries.  Overall I enjoyed the ambiance, proximity and can see myself coming again to hang out on the patio now that the temps are more cozy.",

    "text": "On the lovely Sunday over MLK weekend, my friends and I rode our bikes down to this joint to see what was a-happenin'. What was happening at the outdoor bar was a huge gay circuit party, which was kind of awesome to see on a Sunday afternoon. We veered left, to grab some food before shoehorning ourselves into the Rebar gaiety. Service was a little weird in that we kind of stood around waiting for someone to acknowledge us and be seated - Do we go inside, just have a seat? what? But then we were cheerfully seated on the patio without much waiting.   Nitty-gritty: chips and salsa were good, but the salsa was totally the old spicy smoky one they had at Ticoz, I swears! (loved it then, not sure what the slight twist they did to it for Bliss, but it's aight still)  Tortilla pizza thing with the pesto, tomato and mozz: meh. there was no zip to it. Very oily and heavy.  Shrimp tempura tacos? Some tasty business. Generously filled with fattie shrimps, and just fresh, crispy and delicious. Didn't come served with any lemon wedges, so we totally ghetto fished the wedges out of our water glasses, and it made a big diff.   Not so great was waiting half an hour for our cocktail order. That's the sucky thing about restaurant service when the waiter has to depend on the bar to make drinks for them. Considering how slammed the bar was with cocktailing 'mos, I understand, but it makes for bad service over on the restaurant side. We were comped our delicious white sangrias for having to wait so long, and that was very much appreciated.  And then, we went to the bar. It was less packed than when we arrived, but still pretty populated, the bartender, David, was just catching up and picking up all the crap he had to clean up after being hit so hard. I thought he was the only bartender there, but it turns out there was another one at the decidedly less busy inside bar area. Didn't seem like outdoor guy had much help, which sucks. I'm sure they made good money that day, but could have probably made a sh*t-ton more with better staffing.   Despite David clearly being pummelled, he was amazingly even-tempered, gracious and polite, and made excellent cocktails, though we had to coach him (only the once) to chill the vodka in our bombers. It was a great place to be on a Sunday afternoon, just hanging out, unpretentious, and 2-4-1 doesn't suck one bit. Definitely will be rolling down there some more.",

    "text": "Almost Bliss/reTHINK Landscaping  I left Seattle for multiple reasons. One was the horrid parking situation. Sure, I've spent 30 years in Phoenix, where parking is (mostly) not only abundant, but *gasp* free! When I was given an invite to an anniversary party at Bliss/reBAR, and the website, itself, boasts about parking on the street or at a closed place next door, I was not very optimistic. Parking is something I want to be the least of my concerns when trying out a new place.  Thankfully, I did find some parking on the street, but then again, I arrived at 5:59PM on a Saturday. As the night crept on, it appears any later, it would've been a problem. So - get there early.  The place itself was rather dead - it's a weekend night and this is supposed to be a faddish place? - so I found my party easy, even though the 5-6 employees at the \"Please Wait To Be Seated\" desk were smiling and helpful. (On a side note, even though there were 4-5 too many staff members hanging out, the empty tables and bar seats outnumbered them 5 to 1.)  Now...at the party, or a long outdoor section alongside the Garfield street side, the decor and arrangements seemed very nice and comfortable. For my friend's 15th Anniversary, they even doctored a picture of them and honored them with well wishes on every table. That was nice.  One very pleasant cocktail waitress brought by multiples of half-sliders, half-grilled cheese sandwiches, half-fried sausage ravioli, mini-coconut chicken tenders and shrimp. All of that was WONDERFUL with the best being the shrimp and ravioli. We were generously given two drink tickets by the host, and we had to get our drinks at the outdoor extremely well decorated bar. No real criticism on the bartender - he did his job, was moderately quick, but just not the friendliest or approachable guy. He was just there.  Inside the bar, it was adequate. The ambiance was okay. Not inviting, but not standoffish. Middle of the road. Amazingly, and unbeknownst to me, towards the beginning of the night the few tables inside had chairs but as the evening grew, they were promptly taken by the staff one-by-one. People had to stand and they were served food. I like to sit at a nice place when I eat. Just me? Maybe it was for more space for more people to pile in, though there wasn't enough evidence for me - again on a Saturday night - that this place gets busy. And speaking of more space...  With three adjoining empty lots and three more within walking distance, there's no excuse for no parking lot. Even if that was out of the question - why? I don't have a clue - the original idea should've been to occupy a larger and vacant plot nearby. Heck, maybe they'd have room for *gulp* two bathrooms!  Oh, and I don't know the general rule about \"chic\" places, but ONE bathroom? Personally, I prefer privacy and not really into the whole idea of the opposite sex wandering around inside the bathroom. Heck, when I was in there, the only two other occupants were female and oddly, they seemed to want to hang out. No, they didn't appear to know each other, they were just standing around. Hmmm. My impression, this was supposed to be a gay-friendly establishment and if they thought something different - especially from me, they're barking up the wrong tree.  This was my first experience with a unisex bathroom, and dear God, I hope it's the last.  Overall, the food was great, the setting was comfortable and the one cocktail waitress was friendly. Sadly, the parking situation, or lack thereof, the lazy one bathroom situation and the terrible neighborhood - oh, yeah, it's located 2 notches from the ghetto, gives me a dead even 3/5 stars and sadly, I probably wouldn't have any reason to return unless someone else drives or I happen to move downtown. Within two blocks. Max.",

    "text": "What a sweet place. I really enjoyed our visit and hope it picks up steam. I loved the menu which includes comfort items like a grilled cheese sandwich and mac and cheese. Both are served just quirky enough to be interesting but not enough to change the \"comfort\" part.   They serve orders of french fries three different ways. I tried the Parmesan french fries which were served with a marinara-like sauce. I wasn't fan of dipping my french fries in a tomato-base. But I admire that they mix up a traditional serving of french fries.   The atmosphere was fun with a large outdoor patio, an exposed brick exterior, and fun pop music (i.e. our table was singing along to Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing'\").   This will be a favorite of ours during the winter months of Phoenix. There's also plenty of room for group happy hours. The central-Phoenix location is convenient!   Give it a try!!!",

I never did make it inside to see the rest of it, but there were a few short and tall tables on the patio. And now that I think about it, there wasn't all that much seating. They did have a cute little tree bar off to the side that had decent service, the service at the tables weren't all that good though. I was able to try some of the mac-n-cheese... pretty freakin' tasty with a little kick to it. Also, their signature Bliss drink, amazing!!",

The ambiance was urban artsy chic however the food/drink was so-so. We had the spinach dip to start and ordered it with veggies as an option offered in the menu-got tortilla chips instead. Entrees were Caesar salad with shrimp (that smelled = not fresh) and a \"wildcat chik wich\" - that was good. We heard the cocktails were all the rage...margarita was no better than a pre-made sugary mix and my husband's American mule was good-he'd have ordered a second if the staff came to check in...we won't be returning. Our experience did not live up to the hype unfortunately :(",

It was definitely a great change up from traditional french toast, it was good but it was missing that WOW factor that I have had at many other restaurants. It is a great place to hang out and relax on their gorgeous patio. A warning in advance this is also a gay bar, which is not a huge issue for me but I could tell the table next to me was uncomfortable. I went on Sunday Funday and there was also a live DJ playing.",

Now, we order fries for $2 dollars and without prior warning, we get half the size usual for a to-go portion. WHAT GIVES!? For $2, we can get two giant fries from McDonald's that will at least be semi-appetizing. Get it together, Bliss, cause you're more like a Bust. Save your thirty bucks for Circle K.",

    "text": "Oh what a blissful experience at Bliss/ReBar!  After a brief visit to rebar on a pub crawl, during which I spent most of the time drooling over the food on the other side of the fence, I've decided to try it out for dinner.   It was a Friday night about 8:30, we were greeted (actually twice), and sat almost immediately.   Our server was very friendly actually sported a personality which was a nice change.  The menu is pretty small, so I won't complain about the number of vegetarian options.  The ratio of vegetarian to non-veggie options was acceptable.  They offered a grilled veggie sandwich, grilled cheese with pear(which you could order without bacon), mac n cheese, several salads and a few appetizers.    Since it was so late, I didn't want to order anything too heavy. I decided on a pesto \"cheese crisp\" and  1/2 red rocket salad, yes I said it RED ROCKET!   A pleasant surprise was that I could order any salad in a half order, which was a great alternative to just getting a \"side salad\".     I'll start with the \"Cheese crisp\"-  fried tortilla sliced into 6 pieces topped with pesto, tomato and fresh mozzarella. -4 Stars.   The salad was also very tasty; it was a fried piece of goat cheese on top of a bed of arugula, with red bell pepper and red onion.  My only complaint is that there were only a few slivers of pepper and onion, so I ended up with a bowl of perfectly dressed arugula.  I made the best of it and added it on top of my cheese crisp... never let arugula go to waste!  My Bf ordered salt and vinegar fries for the table and they were very good, but I actually think they needed a little more seasoning to bring out the vinegar.   In hind sight, if I was eating the entire order it could be overwhelming.  Other orders at the table included a burger and an order of lettuce wraps, I can't speak to either of those as they both contained meat, but the rest of my party seemed pleased.  It all fairness to Bliss, since I didn't order a \"real\" meal, what they served me was very good and the service was spot on.  Since I about 25 minutes away, I wouldn't make a trip to Bliss just to eat, but I will definitely recommend it for a group dinner in the future.",

Server recommended Sausage Ravioli appetizer over the Nachos, saying the nachos were nothing special and you could get them anywhere. We got our ravioli, and they were like frozen-out-of-a-box-Totinos breaded ravioli....totally average/boring. Some friends joined us and ordered the nachos...and they were delicious! Way better than the ravioli!!! The chips seemed home-made, not plain store-bought...and the toppings were fresh and yummy! Oh well, lesson learned. After pigging out on appetizers, I went light and ordered the Rocket Salad for dinner with a side of the fresh vegetable. Even with the delicious breaded goat cheese medallions, I think this salad was way overpriced ($9) for the size. And while the broccolini was delicious, it seemed to be drowned in butter/oil....yummy, yes....a healthy vegetable? No. I don't know, maybe I'm being too harsh on this place...I guess I'd give it another go...but I'm sticking with a 2-star rating for now. (My partner got the baked cod with cauliflower mash - it was pretty tasty, but again the cod was DROWNED in butter, and the cauliflower mash was WAY too buttery/cheesy to be healthy!...Others have said the menu screams \"comfort food\"...and I tend to agree...so if you want bacon and cheese on mac and cheese, with a side of butter...you'll be happy here!)",

She made sure we had everything we needed and did it with a smile. We started out with the nachos which were some of the best nachos I have ever had. They make their own chips and cheese sauce and both are delectable. Unfortunately, a bug decided to join our nacho party, which is the only reason I am giving this place four stars instead of five. Me and my friend both did the Tuesday night special, which comes with a glass of wine, a sandwich (burgers and wraps included) and a side salad for $10. After all the yummy nachos, we were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals. I got the bacon burger and it was really good. They used the same cheese sauce as the nachos so I was on cheese overhaul. We also ordered the brownie sundae and peach cobbler for dessert. The brownie was super yummy, but I was a little disappointed in the cobbler. I love where it is located. You barely notice it. It's tucked away on the corner and I almost felt like I was in the woods somewhere. I will be back to hang out with Haylee and eat those nachos again, as well as try some of their other daily specials.",

The server came over fairly quickly, they offered a fun menu an interesting daily special and a clean soothing interior.  I ordered the chef salad (had turkey and bacon bits as toppings). The size of the salad was on the medium side, slightly larger than a side salad...I felt like it was missing a bread stick or something.  I skipped on the $2 avocado option because the salad price was already $9 and some change...I quickly looked up the place on yelp and asked the server about the Yelp Oct. special and he said he didn't know anything about it.  Aside from my poor selection of that specific salad for lunch this is a cool downtown spot with easy parking, I have seen crowds here on the weekends and at first Fridays so I will be back to try something different...but they could have gone a whole other level with the salad toppings (chopped or carved turkey vs. cold sliced turkey and the bacon didn't seem like it was apple wood smoked or thick cut or anything special....just bacon like you get at any old place like Denny's.  Maybe I'm getting old haha, I just don't expect to spend over $12 on a quick lunch (tax + tip), I love a good lunch time special that gives me a meal (bonus points if it's on the healthy side) with a drink for under $10 tax and tip included...I know you're thinking good luck but aside from Fast Food places there are several out there.",

    "text": "Met up with a big group of people here for a friends birthday. My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive so we decided to grab a drink at the inside bar, as the one on the outside looked super busy. There was a door man who carded us before we entered the bar. There were a handful of people inside, the bartender came right over and then asked, \"you're 21, right?\" and then proceeded to serve me a drink without checking my ID. I have no problem being carded, I have no problem with being carded twice. But don't ask me IF i'm 21, and then not bother to even check my ID. It's just snotty, like you are doing me some favor or something. We paid cash and left right away to wait for our friends outside. After everyone arrived they seated us at a table that was in a separate room from everything else. We were actually sitting next to the window where the servers picked up the food for tables. No one else was in this room but our party. All we could hear was the buzz of the bar and the people having a good time outside the building. Why they didn't want us to enjoy the atmosphere is beyond me. The service was not good either, despite the fact we were so close to the kitchen. At one point we were waiting for our food to arrive and could see it sitting on the ledge, getting cold and waiting to be brought to our table. I was half tempted to go get it myself. It's a lucky thing too that we got our drinks in the beginning as drink service also took a long time. The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the food was pretty good. I got the Mac & Cheese with chicken and bacon which was really good. It was also a huge portion, so when I was finished and we were waiting half an hour just to receive our checks everyone else tried it, loved it, and finished it. Even though the food was good, I will probably never go back.",

I received no menu or drinks until after my friend asked if there was a server that could help. She said they stopped serving food in about 30 minutes. A bartender finally came out and took our order. The food, when we did get it was good and so were the drinks. We did not see our server until the end of the meal and were not offered any refills.  The location is great but the service sucked.",

We have a few bartenders that recognize us as soon as we come in, which always makes the experience more enjoyable. Food wise we always stick to ordering the Mac and cheese balls and the hangover fries, can't go wrong with either. Today's experience was by far the worst. We stood at the outside bar waiting to be served and no one came up to us. Someone else walked up next to us and the bartender immediately started helping him. It's not like they couldn't see us. We figured he or the other bartender would get to us next and nothing. Decided to leave after that. We'll be back, but we'll stick to ordering inside where we know we'll actually be served.",

Although tonight the ambience was lacking but it could have been due to it being a Tuesday night. The drinks were creatively written but didn't taste as advertised. We had to add a separate bottle of Prosecco to make the drinks more palatable. The service was accommodating, wiping down our table and chairs that were dirty with last night's haboob. If you want to enjoy this place to the fullest, I would recommend coming on a weekend when the crowd is alive to enjoy.",

The time passes fast but you don't even notice because the atmosphere is so fun. Also, after your 6th mimosa time doesn't really become important..Everyone is so nice too. I had random people coming up to me to talk and I've never felt so welcomed by customers at a restaurant/bar.

We asked to move and were fairly warned ahead of time that the ReBar side was a bit less attentive. We didn't care, we just needed shade! So we moved to the other side and despite the warning, it took an unnecessarily long amount of time to get drinks, food, silverware, and the check. The server appeared to be pretty taxed, but made apologies for the wait and running back and forth. Several of the orders came out incorrectly but we didn't want to made anything of it because it appeared as though he really was doing his best.  We were bummed because the dishes were pretty bland tasting and average looking. The Bloody Mary needed work. The sandwiches and salads charge quite a bit for extras like protein or french fries which is weird-- the only place I've seen that charges extra for fries is somewhere like ZinBurger that's known for quality, super tasty entrees. You can charge extra for protein on a salad if the base of the salad is really strong. At Bliss is just felt like an unnecessary up charge.  Overall, the menu needs a little class. Someone with a good palette and eye needs to liven it up and make it more professional. I feel like most everything could have been made in my own kitchen.  It is in a great location, and the patio is beautiful and such a great environment, but I won't go back for more than drinks because it's just not worth the price.",

    "text": "We went here during one of the crazy rainy days Phoenix rarely has, and although it was a Friday, there was hardly anyone here! I can't say that this is representative of every Friday night though; I think the rain kept people away.  While I can't comment on the Friday night atmosphere due to that reason, I can say: WOW to the food! As reviewers have noted, the pretzel bread is killer. Get it!!! I got the shrimp BLT (minus the BLT, I know it's sacrilege but I don't eat bacon) - SO good! My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich with the pretzel bread and he loved it. I wish I had the pretzel bread on mine... next time!  The best part to me was happy hour - SUCH good prices. We walked out of the bar spending less than $5 on drinks (granted, one of us was the DD, so only one person was drinking, but still. $5!!!) Speaking of driving, parking's actually not that bad. Parking downtown is free after 5 p.m., and there is plenty of street parking all around Bliss.  I can't wait to go back to Bliss when it's a little more crowded - we had awesome service from the staff, but I'd like to test it when it's busier. I LOVE the happy hour prices and can't wait to try the mac and cheese- people around us ordered it, and it looked HUGE. Yum!",

    "text": "My first experience with Bliss/Rebar was during a Phoenix Pub Crawl.  After already having visited several other pubs and bar it was refreshing to find a place where the large group could all sit together and hang out instead of being scattered.  It was quick and easy to get drinks and the patio seating was a welcomed environment. Since that time I have returned numerous times to visit both the bar half on a first friday or to hang out with friends and also to chevk out their restsurant half. Living down the street Bliss/Rebar has become one of my favorite local places to visit.   My friends and I love to come here for Sunday morning brunch. There socials on mimosas and bloody Mary's are exceptional. We usually take advantage of the $10 mimosa during brunch.  When there are four of us it is enough for everyone to have two glasses worth.   Their brunch menu is quite amazing, breakfast nachos, pancakes, breakfast sandwhich(on a pretzel bun-a little taste of heaven there), and so much more.  I haven't tried one item on it that I have not enjoyed.  I have also been here for dinner many times.  The Mac and cheese is amazing! Love the spicy chorizo version, although I like to add bacon to it.  The meatloaf sand which is delicious, love that the meatloaf is wrapped in bacon. Their salads are served with giant romaine lettuce leaves so you can turn your salad into a lettuce wrap if you like.  I haven't tried it yet but I'm looking forward to the quinoa and lentil salad. I would recommend trying any sand which on a pretzel bun.  It culinary wonderment how the pretzel bun can compliment any sand which or burger into melt in your mouth magic. The fries are shoe string size and can be flavored in a few ways. My favorite is still the salt and pepper but the garlic Parmesan is a close second.  The draw back to having fries is that it is an extra charge $2, since the offered side is a small salad. While this is healthier for you, if I'm going to eat a burger or sand which I don't want a healthy salad as a side.   The drinks here warrant a mixed review.  While Bliss/Rebar offers a daily, including weekends, happy hour from 3-6:30, the caliber of the drinks is nothing exceptional. I have tried just about all of the specialty cocktails there isn't one that stands out to me as exceptional.  The drinks themselves do feel a bit watered down and lack that punch you expect to have. The group therapy is a fun drink to have with a couple of friends.  It is served in a extra large champaign style glass/bowl and multiple straws. While sharing this drink was fun the nearly $20 price tag is a bit steep when 75% of the glass is ice. :( The daily drink specials are fun but I usually have to point out on my phone what they are to the waitstaff.",

    "text": "It saddens me to say this as Bliss/ReBar has always been a favorite but today was a huge disappointment.  I won't go on and on...I'll just say my food was pretty bad.  I am the benedict with the lack of pretzel bread (my boyfriend quoted me in an earlier review) and yes it was the \"worst benedict I've ever had.\"  The bread which was supposed to be pretzel bread was too very tiny slices of something that looked more like bruschetta bread.  When we asked about this we were told indeed it was pretzel bread, however compared to my friend who had the french toast on pretzel bread, (which looked amazing)  the bread was completely different...don't lie to me sir!    Anyway-beyond the bread-the eggs were cold (gross), tiny, and I don't even think there was any hollandaise sauce on it.  Needless to say, it was so unsavory, I left some of the nasty egg on the plate.   We had just run the AIDSWalk 5k and I was starving..and this breakfast did not fill me up.  I actually left still feeling hungry which is the first time this has ever happened at Bliss/ReBar.    My friend is a lady who likes to post pictures of her food, and I keep going back to the pic she posted of her french toast with serious food regret.  In addition to this, there were phantom items on our menu which we were charged for, luckily they were taken off, and my boyfriend's scramble which came out quite a bit later than everyone else's food was pretty sub par.     I've always had amazing service at Bliss/ReBar, and the food has always been my favorite...I sincerely hope today was a fluke.",

I had the most amazing burger here, no joke. A nice size burger patty on a pretzel bun  covered with their own cheese sauce that was oozing out of the sides of my burger and topped with 2 huge pieces of bacon..thats it!! WOW!! So much flavor.... I was in aahhh with every bite. I was sharing this with the husband and I didn't want to give up the other half. Fries were just my style, super skinny & crispy, topped with parmesan and garlic...mmmmm!! Also had the coconut chicken tenders with citrus honey ginger sauce, chicken was cooked wonderfully and that dipping sauce made it extra special.  My husband had the bartender make a grape martini for me, it was perfect, and after 2 of them I was done.   All I can say is YUM  !!",

Bliss=Restaurant side reBar=Bar side  The chef that created this menu clearly went to culinary school.  My favorite is the Bliss Burger with cheese sauce.  I also love the fries with aioli sauce.  If you want a nice calm atmosphere, going here during the week is perfect.  Understand the side next to it is a bar that is happening on Friday and Saturday nights.  I recommend checking the specials of the day as there is something interesting (off menu) that is cooked that you just don't get other places.   The food is always up to snuff and leaving you feeling satisfied.  The service is good.    The bar next door is a great place to socialize as well.  Know that it is a gay/gay-friendly bar, though MANY straight couples also hang out there... typical downtown feel to it.  Sunday is a great place to go as well for brunch with a good mimosa special.  If you are downtown and want a place with good prices, but amazing food... go here!",

    "text": "Every time I seem to order from this place online, it takes forever and service is horrible (but when you sit down, they know they will make tips so they seem super nice then). I called them and asked them how long it would take to order...2.5 hours! This is because they go through a 3rd party vendor that may or may not be busy delivering for dozens of other places. So then my colleagues and I, as well as some of my bosses, decide to order for pick up. We make our orders and they tell us 15 minutes.  I wait 30 minutes before leaving our office, which is about 10 minutes away, just to make sure the food is done. When I arrive, I tell the bartender that I am there for a pick up order to which she replies, \"When it's done, they'll bring it out.\" This obviously meant it was not ready yet.  I sat there for about 45 minutes and no one even offered me water, granted it was hot outside and I came in sweating must not have given away my thirst or need for water at all. After about 30 minutes, my boss called me wondering where her food was because she was starving and we were working on the weekend because we had a lot of TIMELY things to do, and could not wait for food for more than an hour. She then called the restaurant, who told her they would give a 20% discount on the entire order of meals. I was not sure what the totals were for all bills except mine, which they did not hand me a receipt for when I paid, but all others had receipts. When I returned to my office, we calculated it and the 20% never came off of any of our bills.  My boss, infuriated, was upset and just decided she would rather not eat there than waste time trying to get some decent customer service. BlissReBAR, you lost 5 customers that day. We won't pay for anything here again. Food is not worth that much, price-wise ESPECIALLY if you have to wait for an hour+ and they do not accommodate you and your complaints or provide you with basic customer service.",

Pros: Happy hour drinks are plentiful to choose from and pretty good. 3 martinis for $9? Awesome! The appetizer menu was extensive and had a full array of things on it. We tried: the Asian ribs (special of the day and tasted like the average well made Korean beef rib- but the slaw was amazing), macaroni and cheese (yum! as good as my own), pretzel bread with dipping sauces (the tomato sauce was kinda weird, but the cheese was good), and chocolate chip cookies (good but a wee overdone- plus the bartender was nice enough to bring my friend milk that was not on the menu) Atmosphere was great! Cons: The server wasn't the most knowledgeable, I had to question the happy hour selection he gave us because the signs in the bathrooms said something different. He was nice about it, but still. Parking is annoying. No lot to park in and only street parking, which in this area, seems to be few and far between.",

I will be back to try out some more of that menu!",

The waitress/bartender neglected to bring over a menu, so I ended up not ordering anything to eat, despite being fairly hungry.  Luckily, the mac&cheese ordered by one of my table-mates was tasty and quite a large portion, so I got a few bites in.  After quite awhile, we were finally checked on, and I ordered a drink.  When the waitress got to the other end of our table, she told them about the drink special of the night - at $3, it was quite a steal!  Maybe they should tell the specials to the whole table though, before orders are placed?  Just a thought!  I love the atmosphere, but it was hampered by the smokers.  Not sure how they are able to get away with smoking right next to the entrance, but it was definitely allowed.  Gross!  Next time, I'd opt for food indoors with the drink special.  That might bump my rating up a bit!",

    "text": "Went here to celebrate my birthday with some of my hot babe friends, which happened to be cinco de mayo.  Rachel was our bartender/server.  She is very friendly and helpful.  We asked for her recommendations as to what was popular and good.  There was seven of us so we had an opportunity to try quite a few items on the menu.   We ordered the fried sausage ravioli, the coconut chicken tenders, the chicken lettuce wraps, tempura vegetable medley, and the chef's sliders, all from the appetizer menu.  We also tried the mac 'n cheese with bacon and the pork chop dinner.  She makes a great French martini.  I must admit I didn't like the margarita.  I guess it's cause I don't like it with ice, and I like more salt on the rim, but probably my fault since I didn't tell her I didn't want it on ice.  Everything was fabulous, but if you're going to order anything, absolutely a must is the mac 'n cheese with the bacon.  The bacon really adds to it.  And the pork dinner had the right amount of \"gravy.\"  I don't know if I could even call it gravy, but we were practically licking the plates of the mac 'n cheese and the pork.  I really liked the ravioli and the sliders.  Since I'm not all that big on fried food, all I can say is that they were good for fried food, but it wouldn't be something I, personally, would order.  But that's me.  Just like I wouldn't order lamb, but we won't go there.  I'd absolutely return.  reBAR is across the patio, and is the bar.  We dropped in there to see what it looked like.",

Well, the food didn't meet up to expectations. We had the pretzel bread (boring), their homemade chips and dip (the chips were totally burnt and no one at our table touched them) but the nachos were delicious. I had their eggplant sandwich and one other girl at our table tried mine as well. We both got food poisoning. I was actively sick for about 36 hours. I called the restaurant just to let them know so they could check their ingredients, and the girl on the phone was very nice but told me she'd have to have the manager or chef call me back. She took my number... and I never heard a thing. I sure hope they didn't serve any more of those to anyone else!",

We went for dinner before an event and I can't wait to go back when we've got 2 things...a d.d. and time. On a recommendation of the server we went for meaty mac and cheese and shrimp pesto penne. The meaty mac and cheese was so smooth and creamy and the ratio of meat to pasta was perfectly matched. The pesto was also tasty; they seemed to complement each other in a strange way. The iced tea was very good and the server was attentive, our glasses weren't empty for long.  We can't wait to go back and sample more the the menu.",

Had the Mac and Cheese with chicken and Bacon and it was awesome.  Review for reBAR:  Layout is excellent and the drinks were poured good...I like the fact that it is open and people can just walk up to the place.  The crowd is mixed and it seems that the \"pretty people\" have left other bars to hang out here.  This could end up being the ultimate happy hour place for those young executives downtown....and good looking ones at that....  The place clears out after 10pm, but still enough people around to have a good time.  High times seem to be from 6 to 9pm.  Good pre-bar.....hmmm...maybe they should of called it preBAR.",

I had the Mac and Cheese it was good but not great maybe I would have enjoyed it more if it was baked or maybe I should have ordered something with a pretzel bun. After dinner we went on to the Drink side of the establishment and grabbed a seat on the outside patio, super functional that the bar is just a hop, skip and jump away. While we sat outside people kept arriving for the Sunday Karaoke night.  Karaoke singers looked like they were having a blast inside but as we were sitting outside we could not hear. Outside was relaxing and great for conversation on this quiet Sunday my only suggestion for outside would be to offer a bit more seating.",

Turned out to be a great choice! Loved the menu selection, every single item was just slightly different. The menu was small, but not too small. Enough choices without it being terribly difficult to choose. Started off with a ton of appetizers. The pretzel bread, sweet potato chips, shoestring vinegar fries and 2 different types of wings. Every single appetizers was delicious. I think my favorite was the sweet potato chips. Nice and crispy. Each item was paired perfectly with a special dip. By the time our food came around we were already getting full! I had the shrimp soft tacos - amazing! The shrimp was crispy and perfect. I only could get one down, but it will serve as my lunch tomorrow. Tried the loaded mac and cheese too - rich and savory. I could eat that shit right now! Service was quick and friendly, no problems at all.  Would love to go back and try some of the other dishes on the menu. They serve brunch as well which also looked fabulous of course.

Can't say enough nice things about the hostess/server last night,  She was friendly, attentive and gave you just enough space to enjoy your dining partner while engaging you at the same time.  Grilled pretzel bread and cheese sauce was good; bread was hardly grilled on one side and a little charred on the other.  I had the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was not good.  The chicken was loaded with grissle; you knew what you were chewing wasn't chicken meat!  A little tastless as well.  I opted for a side of fries and they were so pale when the plate was delivered, I wasn't even sure if they had been fried.  WAY under done.  My dining partner had the mac-n-chees with bacon and chicken.  She said it was good.  The same cheese sauce is used for this as the dipping sauce for the pretzel bread.  For me, it's not a good thing that a place makes one cheese sauce for all things that have cheese.  I give it 2 stars for the food; 3 stars as a cool place to stop and have a drink and then move on for the main course.",

All it needs is to work out some minor kinks though, and I hope it does, because then I would happily revisit.   Though all the staff were really nice, we were seated for about 15 minutes before a server came over. Then it took another 10-15 minutes to get our drink orders. They ran out of a main ingredient on the menu so I couldn't order what I wanted to, and frankly, the menu failed to impress. There was nothing altogether unique on the menu that made me excited to try it, nor would I say, \"Oh, I want to come back and try that next time.\" I settled for the grilled cheese, which was pretty bland. Nothing memorable about it. It had pears on it, which it didn't need. I get that it was trying to be a little different like that, but they didn't add to it at all. And the only thing it came with was one sad-looking pickle. My sandwich also arrived about 10 minutes before the server brought out my date's entree, which was just weird.   On a positive note, my dirty martini was perfect and I had a fun time just sitting at the bar afterward. I would definitely go back to the bar for a drink, but have no desire to retry the restaurant.",

The crowd makes such a difference because the space itself is so great.  Fairly nice bartenders too, one of which recommended a tequila shot with a pineapple chaser which changed my whole perspective on tequila shooters.  Good show!",

    "text": "When I heard Bliss was opening I had to go check it out as a fan of Fez, Switch and Ticoz. I love what they have done with the place. It is so much nicer than it's previous couple of attempts. I also like the parking. The staff is very friendly and the place has a mixed but heavily Gay clientele.  We decided to order cocktails. The choices were more limited than Fez and they couldn't make a Mojito so I ordered a peach martini. It was not that great and I was driving so I only had one. They were out of menus so we borrowed one from another table. hopefully they will order more. We decided to share a naked Mac and Cheese and a Cheese crisp (the waiter recommended the Tomato and pesto and a coconut Chicken tender for a starter.  The Chicken tenders were amazing. The food came out before we had even started on the Chicken but we were ready for the Mac and Cheese. It had Bacon and was spicy maybe jalapeno. The Mac and Cheese was a winner. Truly one of the better in town.   The cheese crisps were another story. It was a tortilla lightly spread with pesto, with a few slices of store bought quality tomatoes and mozzarella cheese slices on it. It was not very good and certainly not an entree by any stretch much less a $9 one. I think it should be an appetizer if anything any at most $5. Seriously I was completely disappointed with this dish. If that was what I had ordered as an Entree, I would probably not have gone back if I didn't know they could do better.  Obviously they are new and working things out. They need to work on the drink selection and add maybe three additional entrees around the $10 price range or under. The waiter said the tempura was not very good and his description didn't sound what I wanted either.  The brunch sounds good too but again it is a very limited menu.  All that said, it is going to be a great place after they work out a few things and the service is fantastic.",

On top of it all Di was sick in the night but that is likely due to her having a Margarita. Won't be back there.",

    "text": "Stopped by here after seeing one of the afternoon movies at the Phoenix Art Museum when I saw that Angel Trumpet House was way packed and glad I did. My father and I had the Bliss Nachos, which are made with flash fried flour instead of corn tortillas, and they not only put pickled jalapenos on them but sliced purple cabbage. It may seem odd but works and then they use a white cheese sauce and the crumbly white Mexican cheese. I think they were like $7.50 and for $2 more I got pulled white meat chickenon them, quite good. I tend to like corn tortillas but this was sort of a white chip with white cheese sauce and white cheese, and then white chicken.....sort of an artistic statement i guess, like interior decorating from the 80s, but it came together nicely.  I also ordered an Old Fashion. The bartender told me he used Maker's Mark and asked me if that was okay. I said sure and assumed I would be paying a premium but from 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays it seems it is happy hour and it was $4, which is an amazing price! My only gripe would be that the bartender shook it with ice and generally it is the sort of drink that is best made without ice and then poured into a glass with one large ice cube, like they do over at the bar at the Blue Hound. I don't know how much that sort of ice machine costs but it makes a difference, so something for this establishment to consider.   Bottom line though, I will be coming back and the servers were friendly as well. I expect they will be quite busy later this year with the opening of the Roosevelt Point student apartments opening up literally, right across the street. :-)",

Service is always stellar, I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and it's a great atmosphere for a business lunch, happy hour with friends, a date, or a late night hang out.   My favorites on the menu are any sandwich in the pretzel roll, the pretzel bread app, coconut chicken strips, Mac and cheese, any of the salads, and more anything pretzel.  There is usually a great special whether it's food or a drink of the day, and portions are generous so even though it's a hip place, it's reasonably priced.   I love relaxing on the patio. Even when the weather is warm, it's usually comfortable out there with the shade and misters.",

My friend got a Pom comso also delicious!  We started off with the pretzel bread which was A1, and for my meal I got the coconut chicken strips and fries and my friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich which also had coleslaw and bleu cheese. The food was all really really good ! It was fresh, hot, and came out right away!  Afterwards I got a dirty gin martini with extra olives which once again, GOOD!

Me and my Gps had an issue finding this place, but once there, the atmosphere was already pre-clubish on a Friday night. People looked like they were having a good time on the patio and bar area. I asked to be seated in the cafe area, which was a bit quieter. Server was nice, I think he was the assistant manager. Service was friendly honest about his recommendations and prompted.  The food started well, with the prezel bread did not disappoint. Yes, the cheese sauce made the dish. I did'nt care for the tomato jam, a little sweet for the bread if you ask me, but not the worst. The waiter told me that with the dip trio, people hate or love the tomato jam. I am glad he was honest, but I would recommend offering guests the choice of the three or having two or three of the same dip. I would have order three of the cheese myself. Next, I tried this loaded mac and cheese, which I was ok, but not the best thing I've tasted. I felt you could only taste one cheese in the dish, the bacon and chicken combo was a little bland to me. I think I had a cobber, but since I dont remember, I will not review it. But  I do remember the pretzel bread was on point and I should have ordered more.  Costs were good and I enjoyed the atmosphere, but the food was overall just okay.",

I ordered the spicy mac & cheese (with chorizo and siracha) and it was quite possibly the best mac and cheese I've had in my life. The level of heat was just right and it was super creamy and delicious! It arrived probably 20 minutes earlier than quoted and was still very warm!   There is a $15 food minimum for delivery, so I added on a dessert, the brownie with vanilla bean ice cream. The brownie was still warm when it arrived and they had the ice cream/sauce in a Styrofoam cup to keep it cold. It was perfect!

The side salad was fresh with a nice vinaigrette, but there was nothing special about the chicken tenders. I'm sure the portion was better than a fast food place, but the flavor/texture sure wasn't. I was pretty disappointed.    The ambience was nice, and the servers were really nice. Because of all the good things I've heard, I would definitely give this place another chance--but probably only for happy hour or brunch. We saw a few staff members pushing a bunch of bottles of alcohol outside while we were eating, and that looked pretty fun.",

Too sweet. It tasted like Kool aid. We also got an order of the short wings that were decent. Then we finished with a bottle of prosecco that was decent. I've been here for Sunday funday before,  they have a great deal for bottles of champagne on the weekend. Overall, this place isn't anything too special but for drink specials it's a good place to stop by.",

Bliss definitely pepped us all up.   The food was A-Ok. I had the chorizo breakfast tacos and a sangria. Sangria was a mix of red wine, a few liqueurs, OJ, and 7up. Tasted like fruit punch. Didn't feel the food was very special.   We sat on the patio, and their seemed to be only 1 waiter for a full patio. Our service was really slow. Felt bad for the waiter who was scrambling, but he still did it with a smile.   Atmosphere of the patio is really cute, loved the cute rebar decor. Peppy place to hang out. Really great patio space! I'd give this place another shot.",

The atmosphere is friendly, welcoming and after the DJ gets there on Sundays at 2pm, it's ready for a party.   There are plenty of drink specials on the weekends, and the food is great too. I suggest stuffing your face with the sliders, the fried pickles, & any style of their potatoes. Thank god they have $12 champagne bottles to help you hydrate through any heaviness in the food",

First and most important the mimosas:  They offer $12 bottles of champagne and then you can purchase a small carffe of juice to add and you can make your own mimosas at your table. I like this because I hate juice full mimosas.    The menu has a great selection!  Very large.  Despite the nachos looking to die for every time I saw them come out and served to another table I had the omelette and subbed egg whites for an additional $2.  The omelette was great. Not dry at all or overcooked! The side of potatoes are the real all star. I would highly suggest getting a side if your entree does not come with them.  People mingle throughout the day on the patio if it's a nice day and they have a variety of types of seating.  Great place to start for brunch and be social, whether there is 2 of your or a large group.  Bartenders and servers were great! super friendly and easy going. You can't be in a bad mood once you come here!",

The bar side was packed full of people.  I was surprised to see that there are several empty tables inside the restaurant side while the outdoor patio was rockin'!  The menu was pretty small, but enough to have something for everyone.  The pretzel bun caught my attention so my hubby and I ordered the Bliss Burger with cheese.  This came with a side of spinach salad for $8.50.  Side of fries cost about $4 more.  My son wanted the Grilled Cheese with provolone, thick slices of bacon and pear since there were NO KIDS MENU. So good!!!   I love when restaurants make traditional staples their own!  I would so go back for the pretzel bun and check out what else they have up their sleaves!!!",

    "text": "To be fair, this review was for April 28, but I was only recently able to finish polishing it up.   The short: Solid contemporary American fare at a fair price, fast and efficient service, clean contemporary surroundings.   The long: Bliss is located on the northeast corner of 4th St. and Garfield. Free street parking can get scarce, but they have a lot on 3rd St north of Roosevelt, and we found unmetered parking an easy trot away on Garfield, just west of 3rd St.   We had reservations for Dining Out for Life, and I was relieved to see how efficiently everything ran on such a busy night. The patio at the connected reBAR was packed, and Bliss' patio was filling, but the tables were spaced so diners wouldn't be too crowded. We sat inside where it was dimly lit, clean, and again, not too tight a fit. The nondescript contemporary decorations faded into the background, but it wasn't boring, and it provided the sound buffer that I'm seeing lacking in more and more new restaurants--bare-walled, hard-surfaced, cement-floored, echoing new restaurants. With that in mind, extra kudos to Bliss for not pumping music so loudly into the tiny space--I was able to have a dinner conversation with my boyfriend without having to raise my voice or strain to hear him. If you like to see the cooks in action, the kitchen is open, and we were just about 8 feet from the window and the expediting chef so we could watch him run quality control over all the dishes coming out.   We started with the $4 grilled pretzel bread, served with a trio of dipping sauces. It was thin slices of pretzel loaf toasted into pretzel chips just small enough to fit into the big condiment cups. Nothing too remarkable, but the dish was tasty and conducive to snacking--a perfect appetizer--and I was glad to be able to switch between the spicy, fatty, and sweet dips: grainy mustard, melted cheese, and some sweet, fruity, red jammy sauce.   My boyfriend had the Blissburger with a side of coleslaw. More pretzel bread here, this time in bun form. The perfectly sized burger was perfectly cooked to medium-rare and was fine, and the greens on top were fresh. The red cabbage-based coleslaw was also good--fresh, crisp, not too sweet nor too vinegary. Really, everything was fine, but altogether, it wasn't a memorable dish. Then again, my most memorable burger in Phoenix is a griddled wineburger from a dive bar.   I had the $15 double cut pork chop dinner sauced with what they call tomato ragout and served with potatoes au gratin and veggies--that night, it was a couple stalks of broccolini. The broccolini was tough--I prefer my broccolini a couple shades softer. I liked the pork chops, but the meat was a little dry on one end. I just wish it hadn't been the end I finished with since it started out so well. The ragout was nice, but it seemed like it needed to be cooked together longer so the flavors could meld together better.   For dessert, we split the $6.50 cobbler of the day--apple. It's everything an apple cobbler with a crust instead of a crumble should be, although it didn't look like any apple cobbler I've seen, with a square of crust sitting on top. No complaints, though--every component was good, and the dessert came together well.   I'd like to try this place on a regular night--I have a feeling the quality of the food can only improve, and everything else was great.",

Around the table I saw Loaded Mac N Cheese, Naked Mac N Cheese, Three Tacos, Chicken Sandwich and Veggie Sandwich. As usual with this crew, the shoestring potatoes (we picked salt/vinegar) were done to perfection. All of the sandwiches were served with a small side of veggie slaw (red cabbage/carrot), which disappeared all around. Sadly there was no room for dessert, which sounded fantastic. Equally as sad...no alcoholic beverages for us, since we were headed back to work. The patio area is quite large and as soon as the temp dips, we'll be asking for that seating...such a beautiful building.",

    "text": "My friend and I went to Bliss for a nice dinner before we met other friends for some drinks.  We were seated quickly and were excited about the menu.  With in 10 minutes of being seated a large (1 1/2\") cockroach crawled across my foot.  Initially I panicked, jumping from the table while trying my hardest not to make a scene. We called the waiter over to investigate, but he could not find the roach.  As you can imagine, we were very unsettled by the experience and the fear of the critter returning.  Sitting there not sure if he had crawled in to our purses, up our chairs or in our hair.........you know that feeling.    We were served drinks as we debated on leaving the establishment and just calling it a night.  We sipped on the cocktails to calm our nerves and thought about our other friend who would be meeting us there later and the hassle it would take to redirect everyone to a different location.  Before we could get completely calmed, the roach returned!! Crawling on the wall just inches from my shoulder!!!!  We jumped from the table, again trying not to make a scene as there were at least 12 other guests in the small dining room.  We were ushered to another section of the establishment and reseated.    At this point we are in pure shock.  Our food came quickly after that, but at this point our appetites were not the same.  But here is the best part, when our $80.00 bill arrived, NOT ONE ITEM WAS COMPED!!  I expressed to the waiter my severe disappointment with our experience and how they did not have the courtesy to comp or at the minimum discount our meal, ESPECIALLY after we made a conscious effort not to make a scene and ruin the experience for some of the other customers.  After expressing my disappointment, we STILL weren't given a discount.  Instead, the manager gave us coupons for $5 off our NEXT visit.  LOL!!!  Good luck getting us to come back dude.  Your cheap decision and lack of customer service is going to cost you A LOT more than $80 now.  We will NEVER return.  Our friends will never return.  My family will never return.  My clients will never return.  I will inform, advise and YELP my poor experience at Bliss to anyone that will listen.  P.S. On a positive note the bartender on the other side of the establishment, ReBar was super friendly, understanding and helped us drown our roach filled disappointment with a strong cocktail.  Thank you ma'am, here's a $5 coupon for that drink.",

    "text": "This was the second time I've been to Bliss. The first time I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Pears, the second time I just went for dessert.  Both times I was disappointed.  The grilled Cheese with pears was small, and didn't have a side.  For 7 dollars I thought it was overpriced, and nothing I couldn't have made at home-just some cheese, slapped on sourdough bread, with some pears.  This past time I had the Brownie Sundae and  it was not very good at all.  The brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.  The ice cream was good, but I also suspect it wasn't homemade-so that was probably why it was tasty.  There was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a sprig of mint. That was it. For $6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie sundae is definitely something I could have made (better) at home.  The ambiance at Bliss is great though, and there isn't much noise. The service was alright, nothing to write home about.  I would recommend if you're absolutely starving and there isn't anywhere else to go. (you're in downtown phoenix though, so there's always somewhere else to go)",

If you order an Arnold Palmer, you probably have to pay $3.00 lemonade and $3.00 ice tea.  *Food took about 30 minutes. *Appetizer came after the entrees. *Had to ask for more silverware. *Had to ask for more water. *Had to get up and pump my own ketchup at the food line!  *Dessert was brought to the wrong table and not enough spoons to share.  *Asked for three separate checks and every check was wrong.   Would I come back? Probably not.",

The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is really nice and good music was spinning, the food was amazing and the drink specials are ridiculous - $10 bottles of champagne and $3 carafes of juice (orange, grapefruit, cranberry or pineapple).  I highly recommend the egg white veggie scramble - so delicious!  We will definitely be back for this amazing brunch!",

No more than a mile trek from corporate and into an outcast part of town so it would seem but none the less, right where it belongs. Youth have been keeping these historical homes downtown relevant for the past 50 years.  HH is a $3dollar martini or draft beer. The young ones that serve here are pretty fun. Over all a very romantic house to chat, laugh and wipe the drink away from your date's lips and give up a kiss.",

This place has a pretty cool vibe.  They have nice outdoor seating and an outdoor bar.  A big building just across the street keeps the blaring sun at bay.  So awesome!  The people here are so nice and friendly.  They kept the drinks flowing as needed and made our day so fun.  The foodie in me of course had to try the food.  I had the nachos with just beef and cheese and they were delicious.  It comes with cabbage but I am not a fan.  They are made with wonton chips instead of tortilla chips.  WOWZA.  Best nachos I've ever had....EVER!  I also tried their chicken strips.  Been wanting to try them since the last Brides of March.  They are coconut chicken tenders w/citrus ginger honey sauce.  Very tasty and filling.  I recommend them if you want to try something different than the normal, standard, boring chicken strip.  They have a DOTD (Drink of the Day) - $4 drinks of the day & more listed on their website.  They have a Weekend Breakfast from 10am-3pm - delicious breakfast classics with $10 bottles of champagne (make your own mimosa), $4 bloody marys & single mimosas.  Have to try that!  Woot woot, loved this place.  5 stars",

My companions enjoyed their meals as well.  The hot fudge sundae was a treat but my husband felt there was too much chocolate compared to the ice cream (I heartily disagree).    All in all, a great little place.  It was fairly empty on a Wednesday night but other reviews say it's packed on the weekends so that's good.  Support local businesses!",

The took of my jalepenos & they didn't tell my fries cost extra. Who the hell wants a side salad as a side? The drinks are great, but also pricey.

Since it was brunch hours, I with the $12 bottle of bubbles, yes baby we are brunchin right!  After checking out the menu I went with the breakfast tacos. Soft corn tortillas with scrambled eggs, chorizo, pepper, onion, cilantro and pico de gallo. Even though the tacos tasted great, they were lacking in filling, like they spilt filling for one taco into 2, so it left me some what hungry still and out of $11 bucks, but hey I did a bottle of bubby at a killer price! I did see some great plates being serve and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Bliss Rebar is a hoppin place, so might have to wait for a few for a table and sometimes service is slow so keep your eye on the time to not go over on your parking meter (the joys of parking downtown). But Bliss Rebar knows how to do fun, so you won't be bored!",

As we were waiting for a couple of other friends to arrive to complete our rag tag brunch party of four, we killed the time at the bar w/the abfab bartenders and the $12 champagne btl +$3 juice special. Worth it!   When our party was all there we were sat at a little table in the middle of it all that offered partial coverage from a nearby stray umbrella from the unrelenting #sundayfunday Phoenix sun.  Service was initially quick and we got our orders super fast, but it took awhile to get our checks and cash out/pay w/our cards because the place was little brimming w/people and I think our poor waiter was just overwhelmed.  He was also nice enough to let us know that while the $12 btls went back to full price at 2pm, the cocktails went on special. Sadly, because our meters were about to expire, we couldn't stay.  The food was on point. The fried mac n cheese balls were amazeballs (see what I did there?) and the sauce they came in was ridic delish!  The french toast bfast was also very good, but definitely a shareable plate, except for the bacon portion, which was only two pieces...and let's face it, you gotta really care for someone to only settle for a single piece of perfectly cured and crispy bacon! So, pro-tip: order an extra side if you split this dish.  The bfast tacos my friend ordered were meh & underwhelming, so I def go w/another brunch option.  What really sets this place apart (besides the ultra-fab crowd/vibe) is the decor! From the wow-factor of the bar and the big metal head sculpture behind the hostess stand to the psychedelic paintings inside, half the fun is just wandering around people watching and exploring the space!",

    "text": "My friend and I walk into Bliss on a Monday evening. Our waiter was Tony whom we instantly fell in like with, mostly because of his cookie monster t-shirt and yoga skills. Tony was the best waiter ever! He's personable and really went out of his way to make sure we were happy. I'm vegan and there aren't many vegan options on the menu so we started working on altering menu items to find me something suitable. The kitchen staff was happy to oblige.The drinks were strong enough to turn us from decent respectable individuals to unfit for public consumption in about about 2 hours which Tony managed to weathered like a pro. He really is waiter of the year. He even saved a woman and her puppy from drowning. Which I thought was noble until we found out she was a Trump supporter. But that's the kind of amazing human Tony is. I even got a hug on the way out. (The woman drowning thing didn't actually happen but I'm sure if it did, Tony would have saved the puppy first.)",

Heavy hand on the mixed drinks which was a nice surprise. Deals everyday of the week which is very nice but they won't let you just 'run a tab', you have to actually run your card and sign it as you order, which is very annoying if you pay cash as they make you pay before you get each drink, appetizer, entree, etc. Other than that its a great place, packed on first Fridays, typical diverse downtown crowd but it leans towards a predominantly gay crowd quite often.",

It was pretty good, not amazing, but we're in the middle of the dessert - I get that.  I really liked the french fries - very thinly cut and crispy.  My friend had the mac n' cheese.  It was an enormous serving.  It was quite tasty.    They had a low-cal drinks menu - I got the margarita which was quite tasty.  The waitress explained to me that they just cut out all of the heavy sugary syrups for these drinks, which was great for me because I don't like very sweet drinks.  The kitchen is open for all to see, so I was able to see all of the other orders coming out.  Everything looked very good.  I would come back.",

The service was awesome, again the drinks were tasty, and the food was excellent. I had the grilled pretzel bread with dipping sauces and tempura shrimp BLTA sandwich. The grilling of the pretzel bread varied (and not in the best way), but the cheese sauce completely made up for it. And the sandwich was ridiculously tasty...

Always enjoy grabbing a few drinks at the outdoor bar at night.  During the day it functions as an awesome restaurant.  Trees surround the patio, making it a great outdoor eating spot with almost a whimsical feel.  Food-varies from 2 to 4 stars.  Pretzel buns are a must (if your food doesn't come on one, as them), and their nachos and mac-and-cheese have an awesome sauce.  It stops around there though, as salt and oil are clearly the favorite ingredients.  We got the two specials today-calamari tasted like nothing but salt, shrimp-and-grits were like a ship sinking in a sea of oil, and my eggplant/veggie sandwich was raining an oil monsoon.  Yuck!  Drinks-3 stars.  Pretty decent bar staff and generally great service.  If it's not super busy you might even catch a conversation with a bartender.  They could use a better beer selection though, since I can't justify any more $5 Fat Tires downtown.  I've never had an issue finding free street parking, check 4th St. or Garfield.",

We were going to go to Matt's Big Breakfast but that place always has such a long line outside, I've only been able to withstand the wait once.  So Bliss it was.  I had been to ReBar on a few occasions, mostly on First Fridays.  Its a great patio.  The bar is big and round and constructed around a rebar fountain-shaped sculpture with bougainvillea growing in it.  Clever and pleasing to the eye.  But I'd never been to the restaurant next door.  We got right in.  My niece settled on the french toast.  It is made with pretzel bread, covered in cream cheese frosting and berries and comes with 2 strips of bacon.  It also came with maple syrup which when poured over the dish seemed to me a bit of sugar overkill.....but my niece loved it.  I tried to order the eggs Benedict, my favorite breakfast food, but was told they no longer were going to have it on the menu but hadn't taken it off yet.  That bummed me out kinda.  Take it off the menu if you don't want your waiters to have to explain all day long that your patrons can't have what they want to order.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomatoes.  Unfortunately, they put slices of apple on there too, which I guess I overlooked as being a part of the dish on the menu.  Unfortunately, I don't like the combo of tomatoes and apples and picked all the apples out.  It came with a perfectly fine mixed green salad.  Our waiter was affable and attentive to us when our beverages were getting low.   I'd go back and order other items....I just really wanted that eggs Benedict.",

I came with a party of 9 and they put us on the list  which really never had a time of a waiting time it was like find a table yourself. After waiting 30 minutes  I finally found a table   I had to tell them to sit us  then after we sat I had  to chase someone to take our order.  The food is great  but the wait not worth it.The service   Is Terrible  my friends and I will never come here again this restaurant",

My most favorite item is one which they no longer serve. It was the Philly Cheesesteak and they used this blend on it also.  I am not going to give away the cheese blend as you need to ask your waiter.  I only know that I now use a similar blend in my cooking.  The atmosphere is good especially if you get there at an inbetween time in order to enjoy the quieter times.  Great service too.  I go here quite often and have never been disappointed.",

A friend and I shared two sandwiches - the tempura shrimp BLTA and grilled cheese.  The tempura shrimp BLTA was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! Each came with a little spinach leaf side salad with a delish dressing. We splurged and ordered warm cookies for dessert and presented to us were 3 GIANT chocolate chip cookies (like the size of two of my hands!)  I definitely recommend it - sit on the patio, leisurely sip a cocktail, and have the best sandwich mmmmm",

Happy hour ends at 6:30p but on Wednesdays you get 20% off your total bill =)  I like that it wasn't crowded so we got lots of attention from the bartender.  The drinks were awesome.  I ordered my fav martini (not on the menu) and Tara (I think that was her name) made it perfectly.  While I'll definitely come here to drink again, I'll eat before I come.  I had the wings and they reminded me of some Tyson wings you could buy from frozen food section of your local grocery store and cook at home.  The chipotle ranch sauce served with the wings was awesome though...and I drank enough that it really didn't matter that the wings weren't that great. Good happy hour spot!",

    "text": "I have eaten at Ticoz, Fez, and Switch and find them reasonably good. They aren't top of my list of downtown restaurants, and I can't say I've ever craved anything from them, but they usually offer reliable good eats. Since I live in the neighborhood of Bliss/reBAR, and my friend and I were hungry for lunch this past Sunday (and for those of you downtowners, you know how hard it is to find a good restaurant open on a Sunday!!!), we thought we'd try it out.   Since we had already eaten breakfast, we were looking forward to some lunch grub. Unfortunately, Bliss only serves breakfast until 2PM (as in, you are out of luck if you want to order lunch!). No worries. I like breakfast, so I'll eat it twice in one day. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my friend ordered the omelet. Both of our meals were fine, just not spectacular. The biggest downside was my friend's omelet came with toast - no jam or anything, just plain toast. We asked our server if we could get some jam and were informed that the kitchen didn't stock jam! Um, okay?! To the wait staff's credit, they went above and beyond to try and come up with something to put on the toast. I heard that they are going to start stocking jam in the future, so it must be a common request ;)  Overall, I think the place has good potential. The service was great and the space is interesting (although doesn't appear to be any changes since the space was nine05). I found the menu to be pretty limited, and wished I had gotten to eat lunch vs. breakfast. I think I'll give them some time to work out the kinks before I venture back.",

Yes, nasty and disgusting; my wife ordered the Shrimp Tempura BLTA (a is for avocado) and the shrimp wasn't only not tempura but it smelled fishy and quiet unpleasing. There was hardly any batter on the shrimp and it was soft and squishy not crispy or crunchy. Very unpleasing and my wife almost vomited after the first bite. I could of made this sandwich at home with ingredients from the grocery store.   I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was actually edible just not very good. I would rate it a 5 out of 10. It was suppose to come to with a chorizo and jalapeno gravy that didn't taste like chorizo or jalapenos just fattyness.   The only good thing was the parmesan and rosemary fries, however we ordered a second round of fries and they overcooked them.   The server was great we expressed our concerns and he comped the shrimp tempura and the fries. He wanted us to come back but I don't think I could ever return.  This Mexican left hungry this day.",

    "text": "There are...things to discuss about this place. Let's tackle a review, huh? Whaddyasay......  Bliss/ReBar? You are a wizard. And you put my friends under a spell. I say this because you have mesmerized them into thinking that this is the only place downtown to eat or drink. They want to go there. All. The F*cking. Time. All the time. And I can't keep up. I'm not affected by your Jedi mind tricks...or your Hogwart's spells....or your One Ring to Rule Them All....so it leaves me sitting home, having just recieved my umpteenth text from a beloved friend which reads \"At REBAR!! Get your ass over here! Hurry!\" and just sighing and maybe shedding one tear and deciding not to go. And then spending a night in...reading a good novel. Like Dorothy Zbornak. I just can't go as much as they do.  What did you do to my friends? And why?  Let's get something out in the open....you can't give a restaurant a 5-star review based on cheese nachos. You just can't. Please find the nearest Yelp Exit and use it...because you're taking up modem time.   also.....this place has been open for just over 6 MONTHS. Quit bitching that it was \"dead on a weeknight\". It's a new restaurant! In a shitty economy! It takes time! Be grateful you have extra $$ to go out to dinner with! BREATHE and give it a chance. They are finding their crowd (outside of my wizard enchanted friends, that is). Don't take it out on the establishment because you got your roots done and there's nobody at the restaurant to notice. That's not the restaurant's problem.  THE FOOD: Gotta tell ya'....while I think their food is 'OK', I'm actually shocked that the gays have made this their new home away from homo. There's a noticeable amount of fried items on the menu, and it seems out of character for the gays to build a hive around a place that serves that kind of food. I think the coconut chicken tenders are nice....but they're nothing without the sauce. The salads are good (have had the Cobb and something else I can't remember the name of) and they were decent, but they weren't mixed: they were piles of 'salad ingredients', so if you're picky, asked the kitchen to pre-toss your salad (HEY now...). Really like the chicken lettuce wraps. They're a nice alternative to chicken fingers. Have also had the macaroni and cheese. Found it very tasteful, but I do agree that it's overpriced and am not sure what the \"and more\" means, either.  THE SERVICE: I've had some slow experiences, but no 'bad' experiences. I do NOT envy having the burden of staffing a new restaurant. It would be a daunting experience - especially in Phoenix. There is a lot of incredibly mediocre service in Phoenix. It is hard....HARD, folks, to find good restaurant staff here. It's shocking, and I don't know the answer. I think some of the staff at Bliss/ReBar needs to get a little more fire under their ass and quit worrying about looking pretty to everyone, but I wouldn't say anyone is outright bad.  The bartenders DEFINITELY all have different pours. Some drinks come out like water, while others actually taste like they contain more than an eyedropper amount of alcohol. Quit being stingy with your pours!! It's a BAR! It's REBAR, to be more specific! And a large portion of your clientele is GAY. Give them strong drinks! They bear the burdens of an oppressive society! They can't get married legally! Intoxicate them and they will be loyal scouts to your establishment. Do this instead of cheating by using wizard power to trick them. Trust me on this.  THE CROWD: Since this establishment has one heck of a marketing team, they get a lot of exposure. This place has been coined \"The NEW Place to be Gay\". I'm not sure what that means. Or what the old place was. Or that we had to 'go' someplace to be gay (The Mormons and Baptists just informed me that the 'someplace' is called hell.). Is it like showing up at a party and announcing \"HEY EVERYONE! I brought GAY! Anybody up for a few rounds?\". I digress...  anyway...  it's unfortunately the Amsterdam crowd. Often. Young twinks with a lot of hair product and darting eyes. But on the other hand, you can usually find local actors in 'post rehearsal' or 'post performance' mode there, so that's kinda nice, I guess. But it is a lot of the same people.... all under the same wizard spell. Petrificus Totallus.  So yeah - it's nice that this place has had it's 3rd or 4th reincarnation and that it's going nicely. This location has been a veritable k-hole of business ventures that crashed and burned. Hopefully it'll last. But is it worth going every night? Nope. Does it really warrant a listing as one of Phoenix Magazine's top restaurants? Hmmmmm....not sure on this one. They will need to raise the bar on their menu items to convince me of that.   So until the evil gay wizards decide to release my friends from their evil spell, I guess I won't be seeing them very often. This makes me sad.",

The dinner was excellent; I asked if a couple of changes could be done to one of the menu items and they were more than accommodating and our server, Johnny, was exceptional!  I will ask for him the next time we go.  The drinks at Rebar were prepared well and again, the service was fantastic.  Bottom line:  food quality superior, drink/drink menu very good, views are great and the service was exceptionally good.  We went via light rail and while it's not right on the line, it's not a bad walk - maybe 5 minutes from the Roosevelt stop.  The indoors seemed a little like a pizza joint but the patio for both restaurant and bar are the best.  Enjoy!...",

    "text": "I was first introduced to Bliss/Rebar in the winter of 2011 on a First Friday night. I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and cool vibe, the bar patrons are an array of different mixes, cultures and backgrounds, I loved this place. Well imagine my surprise when the next day my friend takes me to weekend brunch. $10 bottles of mimosas? Yes please! I came to Bliss for brunch for the entire first half of 2012, I loved this place. The service was excellent, the wait staff was incredibly attentive and helpful, and the food and drink specials were like no others. Many a times my friends tried to persuade me to go to FEZ or Switchbar, but no I was faithful to Bliss. This all changed until one day I wanted to impress my lovely LA based friend. That's when the universe decided to teach me a lesson in humility. We arrive at Bliss on a Sunday morning; I went to the host/hostess table, empty. Not a big deal, really not a big deal. Someone who appeared to be a patron stood up from his table to inform me the host would be there shortly. I thanked him and waited. The host arrived, took my name and let me know there was a 20 minute wait. Perfect, we made our way to the bar. The bar atmosphere was great, they had tv's playing the college basketball games, the music was loud enough but not too loud. The service from our bartender was excellent. We see people at the bar ordering food and receiving their food very quickly, we were amazed how fast the food was coming out. We were then informed our table was ready, and to be honest we were a little bummed to be leaving the bar area, especially since we could have ordered our food there. Regardless, we took our table and waited for our server to come. And waited. And waited. And waited. After about a 20 minute wait, I know what you are thinking and I would love to tell you that yes I am exaggerating the time but I am not; I went to ask the host when our server would be with us, he then asked me who our server was, \"uh I'm not sure, they haven't come around\" was my honest reply, unfazed the host told me he would get someone right away. I would love to say they were extremely busy; I would love to say perhaps they didn't see us; I would love to say we were a drunken mess; I would love to say we were dressed in rags. But no, they were no busier than other brunch places midday, there were about 4 servers on the floor and we were right in the middle of the restaurant, right in the middle, we were not drunk and I'd like to think we were dressed nicely. About 5 minutes later, someone does come around, not a server, but another host. Whatever, he's nice enough and takes our order. So we sit and wait for our food. And waited. And waited. And waited, an additional 30 minutes. Did I mention the two hot guys behind us got their meal before us? Oh yeah, well they did. At that moment I wished I was a hot guy, but no I was just a mildly attractive late 20's female who was starving. We finally get our food. The nice host who took our order comes around and asks if we are doing ok, and I hate to be that table. But we were that table. We asked to see the manager. The manager was very apologetic, and he did take our meal off the bill. Unfortunately this is not what I had set out to get accomplished that morning. I had wanted to show my friend a good time in my city, at the places I patronize, eventually I did when we went to good ol' Charlie's, but that's not the point. Not only was our service terrible and lackadaisical, I asked to switch my bacon for turkey sausage and was given bacon, when the manager came out he informed us it was because they do not have sausage at the restaurant, our server/host did not inform us about that. I do not blame him as he was simply covering for someone else, but this is a perfect example of what may happen when you have a host do the wait staff's job. I don't know what happened at Bliss this time and why the service was horrible, perhaps it was a fluke, but to be honest I have never been treated with such disregard I will not be going back to see if indeed it was a fluke. If the restaurant and servers were busy it would have been only courteous for someone to have told us so, rather than have us wait without an explanation, or an offer of water. I'm glad to see other people have had better experiences; I was once a part of the majority as well. I really hope this is not a sign of things to come at Bliss.",

The cocktails were fine but the food here needs help.  I had the $9 burger with the $2 add on for a handful of the thinest fries I have ever seen.  They don't hold up very well in a place that won't turn on the heat and by your second bite they are cold and greasy.  The fixins for the burger are great!  Pretzel bun, fresh produce are both very nice.  The burger, I was told by the bartender to be a 1/2 pound came out the size of a childs portion burger, very thin and covered up by the bun.  The kitchen really needs to work on this staple of any bar.  My wife had the grilled cheese that came out nice but with no heat in the place the second half went cold and therefore uneaten.  May repeat but only for the drink specials and then go someplace else for food.",

I've only been to reBAR for drinks and my friends said the food was great so I was looking forward to it today. Apparently Bliss wasn't prepared for the brunch crowd this morning? We got there at the time they were supposed to open and they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off even though there weren't many customers there yet. When we were seated the restaurant was less than half full and they were acting like it was the biggest group they've ever had to deal with. They never took our drink orders before they asked what we wanted to eat. The servers kept switching, the busers acted offended when you asked them for anything (like condiments), it took forever to order, and most of the food was doused in pepper which bothered nearly everyone in our party of 6. I didn't really care for my sandwich, even though the menu stated their pretzel bread was \"famous,\"  I didn't find it very tasty at all. Add on the obligatory 20% tip for the size of our party and I left super disappointed.",

I was here for First Friday this past weekend. That can alway be a nightmare for any restaurant---especially a new one. We went to the inside bar first while we waited for the rest of our party. The male and female bartenders were not only GREAT to look at, but were so friendly, relaxed and cordial---and made really great drinks. Just that part of the evening was fun. After everyone arrived and got situated, we were given a table outside. It was such a beautiful night and the downtown vibe and views were magnificent. The place has a fairly casual menu but everyone loved what they got, even \"Mr. Picky.\" We were there until about 9, which was almost 3 hrs and I could've stayed for another but felt guilty bcz there was a line to get in.........honestly can't wait to go back!",

Well Johnny, I preferred Fate to Sens, and I prefer most anything over my first dinner tonight at Bliss. With a concise menu of mostly comfort food, I tried the nachos, and my partner the Mac & cheese. Our food arrived within minutes, which was a plus. I confess that nachos are my go-to guilty fave, as fried tortilla strips and cheese are a delicious combo and hard to turd-up. Unfortunately, I am hard pressed to remember worse nachos. The chips were odd, more like wonton triangles. The white cheese on the nachos was the same cheese on my partner's Mac & cheese -- a bland pale cheese bechamel. The Mac was okay, nothing that competes with Mrs. White or Cheuvronts. I finished less than half of my nachos, and the waitress didn't blink an eye as she removed it after I placed my visa card next to the dish signaling my surrender.",

Walk to the left for the restaurant and to the right for the bar.  My husband and I went into the bar and sat at a table for 2.  We were to late for any kind of happy hour but their Saturday drinks special is a cherry vodka with lime drink for $3.  It wasn't bad and I enjoyed 3 of them.  My husband got the street tacos to eat and I had the pretzel bread with dips.  I enjoyed the queso much more than the alfredo.  The best part was the ambiance and I would like to go back some day.",

I come here not as often but as often to be a regular! I've definitely had their delicious nachos, on HH and they also have daily specials throughout the week. But this review is mainly about my experience during brunch which was superb! I love the customer service from our waitress/ bartender she was delightful. This place is also lgbt friendly If you haven't noticed when you walk in! So at brunch which they have Saturday and Sunday, they do a 10$ bottle of champagne special which is would match better than your 4 dollar mimosa. I also ordered the OLala French toast which I thought was gonna be ok? But ended up being so delicious who knew pretzel bread would make something yummy! I also added 2 over easy eggs to make a breakfast complete meal. I definitely will come back and recommend if you wanna try something new and fun or actually in the area to stop by! And leave satisfied! Stay hungry Phoenix!",

(Check the pic) The 3 stars are for the bun, the grilled eggplant sandwich was meh, the sandwich was bland and moist. I believe they can make it better, but hey the pretzel bun is all you need to go there, or NOT.  I asked the waiter for a Hot toddy, he said he doesnt have it, I asked for a moscow mule, he said he doesnt have it either and no gingery stuff, but he said he will make me something 'similar' with whiskey rye and he got it out and there was practically less than a quarter in whiskey glass and charged me $8 for it and it tasted nothing like anything he said, just saying!   guess I am coming back for the pretzel bun.",

You can go back and froth between the two venues (with your drinks in hand). And you can't beat the view of Downtown from their circular bar that is outside. There is also a beautiful full bar in the building to the South.    We were served some samples of the Coconut Chicken and Sausage Ravioli and they were freakin great (at the \"VIP\" pre-view event we got invited to). But I can't speak to anything else on the menu.  The menu looks Damn good. And although the prices aren't cheap they do look fairly reasonable. Certainly better then what was here previously (FATE). The drink prices also seem reasonable ($4 for bottled beer and $5 for most draft).  The hamburgers buns are made of pretzel dough and they also have Mac & Cheese (with Chicken and Bacon) both of which I'm dying to try.  And the best of all, the place is 3 blocks from our house so I'm very excited to try the full menu.",

We arrived at about 8pm and had to park down the street. The surrounding area looked a bit seedy. However, the crowd made me feel very comfortable. The service started out a little slow. It took about 20 minutes before we received water. That was quite disappointing. Fortunately, everything picked from here.  I ordered the nachos with chicken. Trust me, you've never had nachos like these! The chips were flour tortilla chips, the cheese was a white queso style but better and the chicken was in chunks and bursting with flavor! These were not the traditional nachos by far. These were nachos on an entirely different level. I must say they were the best I've ever had!  I tried the Strawberries and Champagne drink first. It had a strawberry vodka and champagne. It was quite tasty. I tried the cream sickle drink special. I was pleasantly surprised! Our server was Mike, he was very friendly and attentive. Our entire party Absolutely Loved our food and drinks! I'd recommend Bliss ReBar to anyone trying to enjoy great food and atmosphere !",

EVERYTHING was cold upon delivery.   I got an email from \"Delivery Dine\" at 6:49pm saying my food was picked up and on they way. The guy got lost and finally delivered at 7:25pm. I live only 9 blocks away!  The guy delivering was on foot and got confused, calling me asking how to get into the building from a completely incorrect address???  -Salt and vinegar fries were NOT salt and vinegar. They were regular, cold fries. -Romaine Wraps were disgusting. They were packaged in a plastic box pre-assembled. The romaine was limp and soggy and it all had a half inch of water (juice) in it (and cold). They should have packaged the romaine separately so one could actually make a wrap rather than a gooey, soggy, gross mess.  -Coconut Chicken was much like last time I tried them. Tiny, over cooked and dry (and cold). -The burger, other than being cold and soggy was fine.   After my previous review I received an email from the manger apologizing and that he' get a handle on quality. That hasn't happened.   I wouldn't recommend and definitely NOT delivery.",

    "text": "First thing first: Get over your fear of carbs and calories and try the mac and cheese. Don't worry about adding meat or veggies to it, the thick cheese is perfect as it is. The grilled cheese is also great, so anything with carbs and cheese will make you happy.   Although the staff often forgets what the specials are, there is ALWAYS a cheap drink-of-the-day, and usually another deal as well (20% off all food, happy hours, etc.). They are also constantly supporting some kind of charity, so check out their website/facebook or the posters in the bathrooms to see what might be going on.  Because the majority of their seating is outdoor, the warmer months are rather quiet in the restaurant. The staff is always pretty outgoing, so even a slow day offers a good time.  A few imperfections: if you ask for a meal substitution, check your food before eating it. I've found meat in my food in MANY occasions, despite requests to make it vegetarian (usually at brunch). Also, the restaurant side and the bar side play different music at the same time. When you are outside the restaurant, you can usually hear both songs at the same time. Oh well.  I've probably visited Bliss ReBar over 50 times. If I still lived in Phoenix, I'd likely be there this weekend.",

I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables.  I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, \"you will wait your turn\" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service.  I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back.",

It was my 3rd time eating at this place and while it is getting better I am not sure it is where it needs to be.  This place is super close to my house but I always over look it because I am just not impressed with the food and sometimes the service.  This time we had a pretty chill waiter.  They had a daily special that I wanted to get without one of the ingredients and was told they couldnt do it, which was fine so I had to pick something else.  When we came to deliver our food, which seemed like it took a long time, he had asked the chef to make the special without the ingredient I didnt want which I thought was pretty cool.  Another thing that they have to remember is that the kitchen area is open for the customers to see.  There were several times that I would glance over and see the chef \"smell\" ingredients which made to feel that things may not be super fresh at this establishment.  I dont know if I will go back to this place to food but their outside areas are nice and should be packed when the weather is nicer.",

Bliss's pretzel bun is made daily by a local bakery downtown, this incredible bun is put on their famous burger and chicken sandwich which are sooooo tasty! A homemade cheese sauce is  put on these sandwiches, which is a great touch. The mac n cheese is one of the best in town, and has taken over my previous favorite, Chelseas kitchen. I am proud to say I am  a french fry whore, and their skinny parmesan fries do it for me every time!  I have almost been through the whole menu including brunch.  For being a new restaurant the staff is doing a great job, the kitchen is so small, I have no idea how the chef's move around! But they make it happen and the food has been consistent every time.   The bar is also way cute and the drinks are poured nicely! Even when it is happy hour you wont get skimpy drinks here darling!  The owners are great guys who are at the restaurant on a a regular.I hope you try BlissRebar and enjoy your time as much as I have, because  I definitely have experienced Bliss:)",

    "text": "Came here around 8:00 last night to graze and drink. I love, love, love the outdoor seating. A great place to meet friends and away the hours in central Phoenix. I am a huge fan of the low-sugar mixed drinks menu: I had a conconction with muddled raspberries that was tart and just the right sweetness, yet not at all short on the booze.  Service was excellent throughout the night.  I wanted to like the food, but was definitely not blown away. A friend and I shared the parmesan shoestring fries--good crispness, just fine. Passing on the signature mac and cheese, I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, my friend the lettuce wraps. Interestingly, the wraps came with Napa cabbage leaves instead of lettuce, which was okay as a substitute until the leaves started to soften. The filling was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but we appreciated the addition of walnuts. The chicken sandwich was good--not certain about the texture of the stone-ground mustard used (too seedy for some, I think), and adding Sriracha definitely toned down any sweetness in the sauce.  The seasonal apple cobbler was partially burnt on one edge, but was fresh-tasting and serviceable.  I will be back!",

    "text": "I believe I found this place via those weekly Yelp specials that get sent out each Wednesday. The BF and I decided to go check it out and found a neat little restaurant/bar, located in downtown. The decor was cool, the place quiet, and the service attentive.  We've been there twice now. Both times, I've gotten the loaded mac and cheese, which is everything a great mac and cheese should be. Rich, creamy, sprinkled with slices of smokey, chewy bacon and moist chicken.   The first time the BF got the pork loin, which was great. If I remember right, the side was these silky mashed potatoes that were heaven, and some vegetables that were buttery and well done. The 2nd time we were there he got the crab cakes (mostly at my enthusiastic urging), which was a special on Valentine's day. I thought it was good, but he's a little harder to impress. I think it didn't blow him out of the water.   We also got the red velvet cake. it was a nice spin on the classic dessert, as it had candied orange peel and some orange in the cake and frosting as well. The peach cobbler is to DIE for, please do get that. Both desserts have been very enjoyable, to say the least.   I only have two quibbles: the drinks have only always been so-so for me. The first time I got one of their 'skinny' drinks, and that was a rather bland letdown. The 2nd time I got their grapefruit cocktail, and it was too bitter for me to drink down. I hate sending drinks and food back, so I stuck some splenda in it and chugged it down. I admit that half the problem was likely me picking the wrong drinks, but it was still rather disappointing.   Also, the 2nd time we went, our server was clearly rather new. We only knew to ask about the red velvet because we heard another server tell the couple next to us about it.  Overall, pretty decent food, good desserts, the drinks are a little hit or miss. Definitely worth a shot!",

Upon arriving, I waited at the bar for a table.  I had only one drink before I realized the bartender could give a crap if I was there or not.  Seems he was more interested in entertaining and acting like some sissy girl, then paying attention to his responsibilities.  Instead of waiting for him, I walked off to check my table status.  Again, I was ignored and not informed that a table was ready.  Once finally seated, service arrived but was severely lacking in substance.  Highly disappointed in this place tonight but I certainly let my presence be known to the owners.  Only time will tell if they care to step up their game and fire a few people.",

Our waiter (Kevin, who is actually one of the 3 owners) was awesome and extremely personable. He suggested the redberry rapture for a drink and it was spectacular (and under 100 calories!) We got to talking about vodka and he spoke of a brand I had never heard before and within minutes, he brought both my hubby and I a sample of the vodka he was talking about. The gesture was great and so was the vodka!   We started with the pretzel bread. delish...especially the tomato dipping jam! I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my hubby got a 1/2 of the loaded Mac and Cheese. The buffalo wrap was really good and the Mac and Cheese was hands down the best I have ever had! I am not a big meat fan so I would probably get it \"naked\" next time but holy cow was it good! A 1/2 order is fine for an average sized meal.   All in all, amazing experience. I loved the concept of \"owners at your service\"....the three owners were the waiters from 7-9pm and all of their tips went to charity. Awesome. I will be back!",

It's clearly popular with its regulars, and it's nice to see a business succeed at this location.  I do wish there were fewer fried appetizers and more items for people who don't eat fried food (out of the bar).  But then I'm a nutritionist for a living...a spectrum of choices may not be what the majority of people who keep this place in business are looking for.",

We had about 15 in our party and were all ready feeling pretty good and were a little loud. The bartender gave us excellent service and laughed and talked with us all while making drinks and handling our food orders. Everyone loved their food and had a blast while we were there. Thanks Bliss ReBar for being a great place to hang out!!",

After waiting thirty minutes and seeing open tables around, we asked the hostess if she had an estimate on wait time. She said she was seating a party of two and we were next. We waited 20 more minutes and watched her seat a different table of four, and watched many other groups walk in and just take tables (I'm assuming they were regulars). Very disorganized, we finally got fed up and just left. The menu was so promising I was sad to miss out! I'd like to try again but I really don't want to put up with that service.",

    "text": "A couple of my coworkers and I were looking for a place to have lunch yesterday. I had been to Bliss Rebar before and really enjoyed, so suggested it. After they looked at the menu online, they decided it looked good and that they wanted to try it.   We decided to start with the pretzel bread and cheese sauce. I was expecting the bread and/or the cheese to cons out warm, but they both came out cold. It was still delicious, but there was not enough pretzel bread for the amount of cheese that came with. Therefore, we asked if we could get somewhere pretzel bread and our server Shawn said of course. He asked if we wanted more cheese too, but we said no thank you, we just need the bread for the rest of the cheese. To our surprise, when we received our bill, Shawn had charged is another $5.00 for the extra pretzel bread. The whole appetizer was $5.00, so I found this to be quite disappointing. I can understand a charge for the extra bread, but it shouldn't equal the cost of the actual dish. Aside from the charge, there was no mention of a charge for the extra bread when we asked for it. We should have been told at the time we asked, cause at $5, we would have said never mind.  We enjoyed our entrees. I had the nachos with braided beef. One of my coworkers had a burger and the other had a salad.",

Well, we got great service.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and helpful.  It was a huge change from the first time I went to this restaurant when it was called something else. I had the Boston Tea Party cocktail: vodka, lemonade, and green tea I believe.  If that's wrong, that's what it tastes like.  It was great.  I love vodka.  For dinner, I had the loaded mac and cheese.  Judge me all you want, it was worth every gram of fat and carbohydrates.  It was filled with lots of chicken and lots of bacon and lots of cheese.  After this meal, I realized how amazing life is that my taste buds have the opportunity to indulge like this.",

Maybe it's the fact that downtown Phoenix is a ghost town after 5 p.m. (unless there's a sporting event or concert) but every time we go to Bliss, which is often, there's maybe one other table seated. And we can't figure out why!    The food is wonderful.  The service is better than most places we've been to.  The specials are great (20% off Wednesdays, $3 house wine during happy hour).  The art is local. What gives?   My husband and I have been coming here for the past year.  I love their macaroni and cheese.  I order it most times we eat here. They use a combo of cheeses and I think one of them is spicy Jack because there is this heat to the cheese sauce that makes it addictive.  My husband and I fight over it.   My husband usually orders either the Buffalo chicken wrap or the barbecue chicken wrap.  He did try the Tempura Shrimp BLTA last time and it looked amazing. He was very happy. (The A stands for Avocado.)  I don't have to ask for a refill of my water here which earns Bliss 5 stars.",

Thought it was so cute, both the outside area and inside area, I bet it's a cool place to go at night as well. The menu was super appealing to me, quite a few appetizing looking vegetarian meals. I was deciding between the lentil and quinoa salad or the veggie Mac n cheese. I went for the Mac n cheese and boy was that a mistake. I think this was the second time in my life I've taken a bite of something, and was so disgusted, I couldn't go in for another bite. It looked tasty too so I was sad! The cheese sauce on it is made at the restaurant, but I just didn't enjoy how it tasted. Also it seemed more like Alfredo than Mac n cheese. My mom got a black bean burger and substituted Rosemary Parmesan fries as her side and was kind enough to share with me. She also substituted the bun with pretzel bread which was awesome. The veggie burger was just a morning star southwestern patty I believe, which kind of sucks but it wasn't bad. The pretzel bun was super delicious. The fries were mediocre.  The servers weren't too attentive in that we weren't checked on much, water cup was empty for a while... However, when I pointed out that I was unhappy with my meal, my server offers to get me something else but I wasn't hungry because I had some of my moms meal. He did take it off our order too which was super nice of him and really appreciated.",

My friend and I went out this first Friday and we came here on a recommendation from another friend saying how awesome the food was. We  arrived around 7:30 and we were told by the hostess it would be about a 40 minute wait for 2 people. No big deal since we planned on getting drinks anyways. We sat at the indoor bar and it wasn't too crowed yet so we served immediately. I wanted something girly so I asked the bartender if he recommend the raspberry cosmo dreamy creamy orangesicle. He informed me that the orangesicle was on special for $4 so I went ahead and ordered that. It was way to sweet for my friends liking but I enjoyed it.   Halfway through our 2nd drink (20mins) a table had opened up for us so we headed inside. We ordered the cheesy mac balls balls to start ($10) I got the atlantic salmon (16.50) and he got the sundried pasta with chicken ($14). The cheesy mac balls came out quickly and were delicious! Glancing around at the other tables I saw that two other parties had ordered the same, I'm glad we didn't miss out. Our plates were cleared immediately and after a few minutes our dinners came out. Everything was so good! The salmon was well cooked came on a bed of spinach and red potato mash. I also tried the pasta and the sauce was great! After dinner we went back to the outdoor patio. More people started coming in from first Friday and the vibe was very friendly.   Overall I will be coming back for the high quality food and great atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'll start by prefacing this in that I never got a chance to try the food. I was in town for a conference, so I can understand that most businesses around the downtown area saw a massive influx...it was also Pride weekend so that was also added to the influx of people. We had a reservation for 4 of us and were promptly seated and our waiter was prompt. Then, after ordering we waited, and waited, and waited, and ultimately got the feeling our waiter was avoiding us due to the long period of time our food was taking.   After almost an hour I gave up and asked about the progress of our order. It had not even been started. I know they were busy but come on! I needed to get back to my conference as I was a speaker so I politely engaged the food runner/expediter about cancelling my order. She was pissed and totally annoyed that I was interrupting her process. She was reluctant to cancel my order but could not guarantee that our food would be ready anytime soon. It finally took me saying, \"that's fine, go ahead and make it, but it won't be paid for,\" and she finally chose to cancel it.   Long story short, I won't be back...even if I make it back to Phoenix, I won't even give this place another thought. If it's busy, you're better off walking to another restaurant downtown.",

I had a screwdriver which was very good. My husband ordered a coffee and unfortunately, that was never brought out. The rest of the group ordered two giant drinks to share. I didn't get the name of this special drink but they are huge. They are very sweet and tasty, but could use more alcohol. Tasted like punch to me. The music is way too loud, very difficult to have a conversation without having to shout. A good start for bar hopping.",

Our waiter, short guy with glasses (Gary or Greg)... horrible waiter. Saw him twice.  Alex the runner was all over the place, (amazing) when I asked him to find our waiter he came back and said he couldn't and he would help us. There was also an argument in the kitchen, some short bartender (working outside) with blonde hair, with RBF, came in snapping at the girl with the pineapple tattoo, cussing and walked out saying \"do your f-ing job\". He was completely unprofessional and rude. Saw him at the bar after breakfast and he had even worse attitude with customers. If I return I will probably wait for another bartender to serve me. Also, our food came out at separate times. From 1st to 3rd plate was a 22minute difference, who wants to eat at different times? The food was pretty awesome though. It probably won't be my choice to return, but if I do, I'll be sure to be selective on who gets my business.",

He then was standing around with nothing to do until someone flagged him down to order drinks but my friend had to grab his attention to get my drink. He then asked for my drink again and it was wrong he guessed it the second time.  During 2 hours of being here he has filled my water once. So upon bringing my forgotten beer my friend asked for more water he then said \"uh yea I got you water once all three of you. \" Well okay good for you it's been two hours I want another water.

There were 9 of us and it was a hot July evening so was worried that we would not be able to find a plot in side, but being a Monday night we had no problem getting a couple tables together. Happy hour specials ran all night on Mondays and we tried one of every appetizer on the specials list and all were great. Especially enjoyed the meat and cheese board, hummus and rosemary Parmesan fries. The hummus came with lots of veggies, a plus versus versions that are only bread.  The atmosphere is very hip with use of rebar throughout and large a varied patio that will be great once fall temperatures hit.",

It was pretty empty but the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was also the bar tender and he did not give the vibe that he wanted to get the hell out of there; which is a win in itself on x-mas eve!!.   The food was awesome. Fried Mac & Cheese Balls= Heaven. The menu is pretty small but everything on it seems to be good.",

While I'm here there has been several regulars who came in and left to spend their money at the 3rd less desirable Kobalt for Karaoke, And spending their money there. As a Front of the House Manager of another restaurant here in town I would say this was a bad move and huge loss of revenue especially since it's been half dead here today.

Kudos to Bliss for consistently keeping it groovy with good music that isn't too loud, and *almost* enough staff to prevent wait times from getting ridiculous.  They've got some nice happy hour specials I haven't taken advantage of yet, like $6 apps on Monday. That or weekend brunch is really all that appeals to me. If I'm out late on any other weeknight, their answer to the valley's numerous reverse happy hours are rather unexciting. As for the weekend nightlife, it's alright as well. Keep in mind it's unofficially a gay bar, which is legit, as my gaybros need places to drink that aren't as wild as Karamba or Charlie's. If you come here on a Friday night, it operates more like a lounge (with inefficient seating) than a restaurant, and everyone there will be prettier than you.   Overall, I don't think their drinks are anything to die for, and I usually just get wine. This is a solid chill spot where you should grab a small meal from time to time, but by no means THE place to kick it in 'til 2am.",

    "text": "Went there recently on a Friday night and the place was busy.  Went to order drinks inside for myself and friends and was told by the bartender that we will be served in plastic cups. These cups were so small, almost half the size of the regular pint glasses they use.   Ok so I figured the cost would be a little less since it was obvious they were no where near the same size as the glass pints.  Nope.  Full price.  Plus the bartender that night  must've been new and inexperienced because he looked confused when trying to ring up people's credit cards, which took forever and he was really slow at making drinks. After that we just left.",

That's not a bad thing, we got right in and it's also Happy Hour all day.  Discounted drinks and apps.  The server (only person on staff)  was very welcoming and friendly.  Didn't get her name but she's of an ethnic background.  She recommended a couple things and we tried a couple. We had the pretzel bread with cheese (omg yummy),  we had the rolled tacos (good),  then we had the grillled cheese and the chicken tacos.  The chicken tacos were a little spicy but good and lots of meat!!  The restaurant was clean as well.  Great little intimate place and delicious food!  Will visit again.",

My friend and I came here for brunch and really enjoyed ourselves. First if all, our server Erik was AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! He made our experience exceptional. Erik was great at suggesting menu items and we loved everything.   We got chicken tacos with habanero pineapple salsa. Crazy good! Then we got Mac and cheese. Ok, anyone who knows me knows I'm a Mac and cheese snob. This stuff was A-mazing. It had broccoli, spinach, tomatoes and 3 cheeses.  The pepper jack gave it the perfect spicy kick. Then we split a southwest salad with avocado. Not sure what's in that dressing, but I'll tell you that You could probably put it on anything horrible and it would turn tasty!  Sitting outside in sunny, 79 degree weather in January when you're from Chicago? Priceless!!",

Today there was a homeless woman that was outside in 115 degrees in distress from the heat. The male bartender brought her inside and sat her down, gave her water and cool towels and asked her if he could do anything else and then called the ambulance for her when it was clear she was in heat distress. He treated her with the utmost of respect and attentiveness just like a paying customer. Bravo for doing it right!",

I haven't done the reBAR side of the combo, so all I can speak of is the restaurant. I like the space, and sure the staff is cute (in a sort of frat-boy/porn star way), but I need good food with my eye candy.  Things I have tried: 1) the chicken soft tacos -- no flavor and HEAVY on the purple cabbage. 2) loaded mac n cheese -- I prefer the mac n cheese at Switch, hands down. 3) buffalo chicken sandwich -- decent taste, but a total mess to eat.",

Since my last review the food has been consistently good, but the service consistently mediocre. After my last trip back in October, I would never come back. I was visiting with a friend on a weeknight. We had come for drinks and stayed close to two hours. About 45 min before closing, we stopped ordering from our server because he was so slow, instead opting to go to the inside bar to get drinks. The majority of the time we were there, we sat at one of the tables on the side patio, but towards the end, we were standing next to the same table and chairs. While we were talking, the owner (well, I am 97% sure he was the owner) walked by and without a word took my friends chair and walked off. I said to my friend, \"Did he just take your chair?\" The owner replied \"Yes, we're closing.\" I apologized and said I didn't realize it was that late, are you closing right now? He responded that they closed in 30 minutes and walked off. It was the absolute rudest I've been treated before. Sorry, there are too many other really good restaurants with great service and all within a short distance for me to have to put up with his bougie attitude.",

Food is just okay.    Here is the GREAT thing about them for breakfast/lunch.  The $10 mimosa special is an entire bottle of champagne with a large caraffe of orange juice.  Enough to get 3-4 people tipsy over breakfast.  $4 bloody mary was decent.  Mac & Cheese is tasty but nothing gourmet about it.   Chicken sandwhich with bacon was just okay.  Pretzel bun best part.  Eggs are okay on the breakfast platter as well.  Fries with grated parmesan cheese and red sauce dip is okay, but nothing special.  After two times, with all of the fantastic places to eat downtown, I probably won't be back.  Seems like it's a better place to go to visit the bar than the restaurant.

Too bad I forgot my ID in another purse so we couldn't go. Fast forward two months later, tried to go to The Roosevelt, still closed (anyone know what's going on there?). We remembered this place from last time and went here.   There were 5 of us and we were promptly seated inside. We were looking to get a few drinks but most of us hadn't eaten yet so this was going to serve as dinner too. Our server was very personable and accommodating. I split the grilled cheese with my boyfriend and it was delicious! The pear was a great touch (we got it w/o the bacon) and very different from any other grilled cheese I have had. We also got the September special bruschetta which came on their pretzel bread (amazing). There were 3 kinds: an olive based one, a mozzarella with pesto sauce (I think they forgot the tomato on it since our friend ordered it and got a slice), and a cucumber-chipotle based one. I had the first 2 and really liked them. Everyone else's food looked delicious and they were all happy with their orders. The price wasn't bad either for food and a few beers. I would definitely come back here again.   The other side was pretty poppin' by the time we left around 9pm and looked more like a bar scene. Maybe we'll have to try that side out next time we're in the area.",

The inside is small but cozy and there is a nice spacious patio area.   They have good beer on tap, like most Roosevelt Row bars. Definitely would like to go back to try the cocktails- they look pretty fun.   But all you really need to get is the nachos with braised beef. Homemade chips- and you can tell. Somehow the cheese sauce is amazing- I suspect it is made fresh. Top it off with some cabbage and tomatoes. So simple, yet so glorious. Me and the bf both love them so much we have seriously considered getting two orders of the nachos. Or coming back at the end of one of our nights- though after a drink or 5 we have yet to do that.   Someday perhaps I'll try something else on the menu besides beer and nachos (the better quality version of the ballpark classic). someday....",

    "text": "Food was decent overall. One member of our group ordered eggs poached medium. The eggs came poached but very runny. When she asked for them to be cooked a little longer, the server obliged. After about 10 mins the server returned and relayed the cook said you \"can't\" cook poached eggs to medium. At least 15 minutes later, the server returned with 2 fried eggs and said \"I don't think these are even poached.\" My friend was starving so she ate them anyways. The server comped the meal...she seemed to be discouraged with her limited ability to meet her customers request due to the kitchen.",

    "text": "First off... very creative use of recycled ReBAR. Awesome to see businesses revamping downtown. Phoenix really needs some night life.  But the real reason for me being a fan... MACARONI & CHEESE. I know, I know, but really, it was that freaking amazing. I had the Naked Mac and Cheese. Naked because it didn't have the bacon and chicken in it. Honestly I don't know if I even want to try the bacon and chicken because the Naked was so divine. I'm not kidding. If you ever make it down to Phoenix and need a cool hang out and late night munchies, hit this joint and order the Mac & Cheese. You'll thank me. If you don't like it then your next lunch is on me.  I also got a little run down from the owner, nice guy, about the foods all being hand made and healthier ingredients. It's always a plus to have good people and a happy owner to greet you.  The only negative, just because I was shocked when I experienced it, was the bathroom. It's got a combined male/female sink area when you first walk in. And I thought I was walking into the ladies room when I opened the door to see a woman washing her hands. ...uhhh... did I just... uhhh... Funny now, but scary when it happened.",

    "text": "I had a Groupon I needed to use, so last Friday my hubby picked me up from work & we went to lunch here. It was a gorgeous day out with a nice breeze so we sat on the patio. Terra was our server & she was so cool & friendly.  For starters we ordered the chips & dip and the grilled pretzel bread. The chips & dip were pretty good, loved the green onion dip but the chips could have been a bit more crispy. The pretzel bread was just ok, a few of the pieces were pretty burnt & the tomato jam dipping sauce was the best of the 3 sauces. I also ordered the strawberries & champagne cocktail, it was nice & strong.  For our entrees; my hubby ordered the grilled chicken sandwich & I ordered the bliss burger loaded, both meals came with a side salad. My hubby liked his sandwich but they put way too much honey mustard on it. My burger was pretty good but I should have just got the regular, the cheese sauce & bacon was a bit too much. The pretzel bread on both sandwiches was so yummy though. The salads were ok, didn't care for the dressing. I decided to order some parmesan fries to share & since I had a Groupon, I also got the bacon mac & cheese to go. The fries were ok, I liked that they were shoestring but they were bland in flavor. I had the mac & cheese for dinner that night & it was pretty good, a lil too oily though & I wish there was more cheese.  Total for everything was $50.67, but with my Groupon it was only $20.67. The atmosphere is great & I would definitely come back to have a drink on the patio, but the food was pretty average so not sure I'd come back for that.",

    "text": "I used a groupon for lunch at this place which was a smoking deal. And I really wanted to like it. I really did. But unfortunately the food was just not good. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The tortilla was very dry which made the whole thing fall apart. I had to cut it up and eat it with a fork. And if it wasn't for a few drops of buffalo sauce that I saw but couldn't taste, I probably would have sent it back thinking it wasn't what I ordered. It didn't taste like it had any sauce what-so-ever in it. I would've guessed it was a grilled chicken wrap with no sauce. And the little \"salad\" that came on the side was more like some leaves of lettuce with a drop of oil on them. There was no flavor at all!  This place does deserve some credit for the atmosphere. The place is super cute and the service was good. All of the staff was very friendly and I really liked the feel of the place. Which made it even more upsetting the food didn't match the ambiance. But I will give this place another try. Maybe in the evening because it looks like it might be a cool place to chill and have a drink!",

The coconut chicken tenders were flavorless and disappointing but the chicken itself was great. The grilled cheese was pretty damn good but I did expect more out of it. The mac 'n cheese is the real winner for sure. Don't even ask how much fat is in this, it's way too much but the flavor is absolutely wonderful.  Our server was friendly and prompt never allowing our drinks to run dry.  We sat outside as the weather was beautiful and I highly recommend this. Inside is small, cramped and noisy.  Do go here if you love bacon  Don't go here if you're homophobic",

    "text": "Can I tell you how much I despised Fate with all its pretentious, snooty bullshit? I should have known the second I realized that Bliss/reBar was in the same building that it was probably tainted from all the leftover evil.  And so it is. We showed up and the restaurant was practically empty. There is no hostess or even a hint of one. We stood there for many minutes on end before even being acknowledged by one of the many servers who were rushing around (perhaps serving to invisible people? The place was dead.). We were told there was a 15 minute wait, or we could eat on the patio. Um, it's 40 degrees...  AND THE PLACE WAS DEAD. I guess we'll wait. We go back outside because there is zero point zero extra room to stand. The server comes back out and says they have two large parties coming in an hour, but we can sit inside now if we can be done in 45 minutes. That's sure inviting, isn't it.  So we hustle on inside and make some hasty selections. $9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and cheese just offends me, so I go with the veggie sandwich. That sounds innocuous enough, right? The food came out straightaway - too fast for a burger to be cooked medium well, like my companion ordered. Sure as shit, she cut into it, and it was bleeding and mooing all over the place. My \"veggie\" sandwich arrives and it looks like a Filet-o-Fish from hell, some huge block of something unidentifiable due to extreme deep-frying. I couldn't help it - I asked the server what the hell it was.   Eggplant.  Ohhhhkay then.   It was like trying to eat a deep fried brick between two pillows. Impossible. The pretzel bread, while yummy, is totally unyielding. Only Jenna Jameson can fit that thing into her mouth. My companion was suffering a similar fate with her bleeding burger. There was mayonnaise and shredded cabbage and boiling hot eggplant juice going everywhere and it was goddamn ridiculous. Neither of us got through even a half of our sandwiches. I wolfed down the side salad just to get something remotely healthy in there after the onslaught of grease, although I almost choked on the buckets of sugar syrup they call salad dressing.  So, while we are attempting to recover from this mess, the server goes MIA. You'd think if they were trying to hustle us out of there, we'd get a damn check. Nope. No. Nada. Had to chase someone down and ask for it. When it finally came, there wasn't even an itemized receipt, so even though the total seemed a little low I couldn't check it out. I was so over the whole experience at the point I didn't even care. I left a shitty tip and we escaped to the bar next door, where the cute bartenders gave us some free drinks and we sucked down innumerable $3 vodka specials for the next four hours.   Just UGH in every way.",
