The place is clean throughout and the employees are friendly and professional.  The chips and salsa they start you off with are amazing.  After having been there several times it is clear the salsa is made fresh as it varies in heat each time we go, averaging on the hotter side.  They have good lunch and happy hour specials and the food is excellent.  The one quirk is that for some reason the burritos vary in size by quite a bit, even when ordering the same variety.  We actually asked the staff about it, who said the chef uses the same tortillas each time.  Oh well, still good food.",

The staff is amazing and cares about making their customers happy. The first time we went, we ordered food to go and had margaritas at the bar while we waited... Based on the atmosphere and the drinks (which are amazing, Maria makes the best Vallarta drinks... They taste so fresh!) I stated the food literally had to taste like crap not to want to come back.

Well I have had mole a sauce before this was delicious. It was advertised as spicy but I did not find it was overly spicy just extremely tasty. They also serve authentic Mexican breakfast if anyone is interested it looks delicious. I will be trying that very soon. Can't say it enough for the service and the environment.

Anaya's has always been on my try list, so we finally went and gave it a shot.  I'm always a little sketchy about different Mexican places than my standard ones, but I was pretty impressed with Anaya's.   I had my typical first time at any Mexican joint plate: Carnitas (with flour tortillas), and a red tamale on the side. The carnitas was REALLY good, I would say above average at worst. I was a fan. The meat was tender and flavorful. The tamale, on the other hand, was decent, but a HUGE drawback is that the masa layer is so thick I had to peel it away and eat it separately. The filling was great though. I have high standards for tamales, and it wasn't the best I've had.  Everyone else in my party was happy though. We splt nachos because of happy hour that were delicious. Wife had the Fundido burrito with shredded beef and she finished it happily. Brother in law had the Chicken Fajita Burrito; he enjoyed it. The good thing about the burrito plates is that they include sour cream and guacamole that is a freaking ridiculous upcharge elsewhere. Mama had the Spinach Enchiladas. She liked them, but had leftovers to spare.  Overall, it was very good (but slightly pricey) and we will definitely be back again.",

I guess they think if you spread it around it looks like more. They must have been running out of the proteins because it was used sparingly. My taco maybe had a spoonful of meat. I will say most of the \"bertos\" taco stands are a lot better. We thought if the prices dropped it could be a cute lunch stop but definitely not a place you want to drop cash for dinner.

As soon as you walk in, you feel so welcomed and at home. They smile, greet you and happily usher you to a table without delay. Once you sit down, they serve you drinks and chips right away. The whole restaurant is spotless! I really appreciated the fact that when the servers weren't waiting on a table, they were cleaning. The pride they have in their restaurant shows.   There has never been a time I looked around for a waiter or got upset because they're either rude or because they gave us slow service. They really make it known that they're glad to have you there. Our cups were never empty and when we left, our stomachs were always filled to the brim with such delicious food! The interior of the restaurant is colorful and shows a lot of culture.   We bring our family and friends here every chance we get! If you haven't been here, GO!! You will not be disappointed. It's very hard to find good customer service nowadays but not at Anaya's!",

Salsa was hot/spicy enough to disturb one person in our party of three.  We thought it was nearly perfect - chunky,  fresh tasting and just a bit spicy.  DH devoured his generous serving of carnitas.  Our guest enjoyed his express burrito made with chile Colorado,  but did comment that it could have been hotter temperature-wise.  One of my 'test' orders for Mexican restaurants is a chile relleno.  And I've sampled plenty if them.  Gotta say that this was outstanding!  I have a strong preference for green sauce, but this red sauce was excellent.    I'd love to go back and order it again and ask for green sauce.  Heck, I'd just love to go back.  Nice looking place,  bright, cheery, CLEAN, and thank  you for keeping the music turned down.  Ask about the daily drink specials BEFORE you order.",

    "text": "wow...what a disappointing visit...in ALL the times we have been here this is the first time we left unhappy.  The ONLY highlight was Martha, she knows what we like, the way we like it and tried to make our dinner as pleasant as possible.  We were sat by the front window and it was extremely warm there, never felt as tho the a/c was on and there was no air movement by us at all and there were no booths available in the shade.  There was a new waiter to us, Roberto, he came to the table, never introduced himself and curtly asked for our drink order.  We ordered our usual a \"bartenders margarita\", he said we had to order from menu, so my wife looked it over and asked for a Hawaiian margarita, frozen.  He came back with the drinks only the drink was on the rocks...she sent it back nd he blended it but it tasted heavily salted, so she didn't drink it.  I tried to order my norm, crispy shrimp tacos but again he told me the only way they are served is like street tacos, I didn't argue and took them. My wife and daughter ordered with no difficulty and no smile or small talk from Roberto.  We are so used to coming here and being greeted so warm and inviting this was a shock to us.  Martha was the one to continually check on us , and we were grateful for that.  When it came time to pay Roberto never even commented on why the margarita wasn't touched nor did he ask if we were satisfied with everything...even if he was new, something should have been addressed about our meal.  This won't stop us from going back due to all the times we have been here with exceptional service however had this been my first visit...I don't think I would be back.",

The service was very good and the staff were pleasant and friendly and, importantly, the place was very clean.    You receive a complimentary small serving of chips and salsa before the meal but if you want more you will have to pay a small charge for them.  The chips were OK and the salsa was acceptable.  The menu is varied with a large number of offerings.  The lunch specials are a pretty good deal and you get enough food to satisfy your lunch hunger without overburdening your digestive tract.    The food was good but not great.  We would return if we were in the neighborhood and hungry, but if I were on a quest for a really good meal I would probably go elsewhere.  It's not the best Mexican food I've had but it is also far from the worst.",

I never leave a Mexican place and say, \"Wow, that was so delish!\"(Unless it is by a four or five diamond chef. I know, food snob here) I adore Otro Cafe, Barrio Cafe, and Frank and Lupes and that is about it. My guess it is a dairy and or pork thing. Well, I decided to try this place since it is very close to my new home and I needed sinus cleaning spicy one night. I have to admit I did not hate it. Ha!  The experience did not start well since no one greeted me for over five minutes. Awkward standing there for that long for sure! To kill time I used the bathroom. Weird though that I still waited afterwards for like two minutes after returning from the Restroom. They need a hostess here. Thankfully, things went better after that and the service was great. The waitress was very nice! I had to knock off a star for that though because of first impressions and all and the fact a guest should never wait that long. ( Especially since another worker saw me and did not offer to help me.)   Now onto the food. The menu here is huge. They have all types of meals and food even some Gringa foods and breakfast. They have homemade pancakes on the menu. I will have to come back to try breakfast. I was shocked to realize I really liked their Chips and Salsa. I am super picky about salsa and I found theirs to be Delish! The Guac was just typical and nothing to write home about, and my Chile Relleno was good but again nothing ground breaking. Still a good find in the neighborhood when the rare occasion Mexican Food craving hits me.   I liked the colorful,coolly painted and tiled decor.  They also did not have on loud music when I was there which I really appreciated.  To conclude, I am still shocked that I kind of liked this place.",

The salsa and chips..A+ The food was very good and not greasy or bland, great flavor....a must try!",

Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner along with specials for each, anyone with a craving for great Mexican food out to try Anaya's.",

On this particular visit, it was the service that left much to be desired.  I ordered (5) mini tacos, advertised at $1.25/each.  I ordered (2) crispy tacos, advertised at $2.25/each, and a side of sour cream.  What she brought me was (5) mini tacos and (4) crispy tacos... I didn't say anything, as I figured I could take them home for lunch the next day.  When the bill came out, it was over $25.  I was charged $2.00 each for the mini tacos and $3.00 for the crispy tacos!  When I inquired, I was told that because I had ordered ONE side of sour cream, she added the sour cream charge to each and every item I ordered!  I waited for her to correct the bill, and asked for a box.  I never saw my waitress again.  Someone else brought my corrected bill, and 10 minutes went by and another guy asked me if I wanted a box and I said yes please!  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I was able to leave, but a lot lighter in the wallet than I had initially anticipated and with 2 extra tacos I didn't order.",

My standard order is cheese enchiladas, taco, rice and beans.   Sorry to report, but other than the salsa I was not impressed.   I still think Ritos, Carolinas, Popos, Pedro's, La Perala certain Humberto's, have better rice and beans.  Not saying I'd never go back, but I'd probably just order a cheese crisp, or nachos.",

The breakfast burrito with asada was really good, and my daughter was able to get french toast. The chips and salsa were also good. The chilaquiles weren't actually my favorite, too much sauce, not enough egg, but overall I'd say it was decent.   The decor is cute, very bright and colorful. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. The location in my opinion isn't the best place to get a lot of business, you'd never see it from the street, but maybe if they advertise more it can become more popular. My only complaint was the amount of time it took to get our food. There were maybe 4  or 5 other groups eating when we were there and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food.",

I'm staying in Glendale for a few days and wanted to grab some good Mexican food, so I surfed Yelp and found Ayana's, and I'm glad I did.  I walked in the door and sat right up at the small but very BIG in personality bar. Miguelito was right there to greet me and take my drink order, Margarita, of course. By far one of the best house margaritas I've ever had. And... BAM ... all of a sudden chips and salsa were right in front of me. The salsa is perfectly spicy.  When it came to ordering my main, I got the Arizona Chimichanga Verde. Soooo good, the meat was tender, the tortilla fried like no other, and the sides of beans and guacamole were on point.  Not once did I have to wait for anything, Miguelito made sure to always be ready at the right time. And the prices are even reasonable, I actually found my bill lower than I expected it to be!!!  I would definitely say stop in and try them out, I might find it hard to believe that they would fall short on any level of expectation.",

We took respite at Anaya's for a good meal before heading home to crash, after welcoming a new baby to the family. The new big sis (2 year old) was being awful but the staff was great. Thankfully, the dining room was almost empty.  We ordered and took turns eating and walking/cuddling the 2 year old in the bar area, as to not disturb the other table in the dining room. Wait staff packed up what was leftover and we were out the door from sit to scoot in 20 mins. If we would have known the child wouldn't cooperate before we ordered, we would have just ordered take-out. It didn't phase the staff at all and we were grateful.   Delicious fajitas, great happy hour margarita specials and the chile relleno was spot on. No wonder this is the only Mex restaurant my parents will go to, in the area. Love it.",

My sexy hubby loved his giant colored red, white and green burrito. It was stuffed with chicken, beans, rice and hearty helping of love. Our son didn't like his grilled cheese too much, super dry and he found an onion hiding in it.  I really liked the Pollo Fundito. It tasted great and made my tummy smile when I was eating it. It truly was fundito to eato! Tap, tap, tap, is this thing on? Hello... Great salsa and fabulously warm chips that melted in your mouth. Super good people to spend a leisurely lunch with.

The restaurant seems very authentic when you first walk in (I've never been to Mexico so I don't know how authentic it was).  I ordered the street tacos al pastor as one of the suggestions by the lovely lady who served us.    I haven't been in Arizona very long but from what I tasted at this restaurant, this is my favorite Mexican place I've found thus far in Arizona.  The food was very tasty and as close to authentic Mexican food as I've tasted.    The reason this restaurant isn't receiving 5 full stars from me is because of the price.  Each one of those street tacos was 3.25 and to me that seems a bit steep.  I know it's a sit down restaurant as opposed to a food truck out on the street, but still 3.25 per taco and then rice and beans and drinks all on top of that adds up really quick.  I'm not saying the pricing is bad especially for a sit down Mexican restaurant but maybe next time I'll steer clear of spending 3.25 on tacos and order something a little more worth the cost.  I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and I hope to be returning someday when I'm in Glendale again.",

I was greeted by friendly staff, it's very cozy and the interior design is awesome. I'm not Mexican, but I could definitely see they really tried to bring out that Mexican theme (not too crazy, just enough). The music wasn't loud like other restaurants, but very smoothing and relaxing.  The staff are great, very kind and gentle.  Food: I ordered Menudo because a lot of Mexican restaurants have it only available during certain days, so when I saw it, I had to order it.  I was hoping to order a fish taco just to taste it, but they didn't have a single menu tacos (it has with other combo meals).  They gave me free chips and salsa which was so fresh and good.   Menudo: one of the best ones I ever had in Phoenix. (Disclaimer: I only had Menudo 4-5 times before).  It was perfect. Hot and little bit spicy, but not too much. Perfect amount of tribe and hominy, and they give you chopped onions, cilantro, limes and tortillas on the side.  The trips seemed very clean unlike some other restuanrats where it has gamey taste, but this place was perfect. I used tortillas and grabbed some of that goodness trips, it was perfect.   Everything was perfect. I would definitely come back here just to eat that Menudo again.",

I was told 10 min (should take like 10-15 I get that)   Went to go pick it up and left at 1:45  Then they tell me they made it fresh. No that's a lie just be honest you forgot my order.   That is all.   Ceviche is good, but not $16 good and if you charge extra for chips that you \"add in\" then let me \"opt out\"",

The cleaner that they use in Rocky Point at almost every hotel and restaurant smells like and I love it.   We always sit at the bar. The bar is super small. Maybe 8 - 10 seats. They have a small Happy Hour every day from 5-7. From house margaritas to quesadillas. The staff is always really friendly. One of my complaints is that their salsa is very inconsistent and the chips are always a bit stale. But their entrees are pretty good. We have had a few of their burritos, and recently tried their ceviche. Nothing out of this world but everything seems to be made from scratch and is always tasty. The red sauce is very good, much better than the green. And their signature Margarita is delicious. They make their own Sweet & Sour.   I believe this place is ran by all family and friends. This place definitely feels like our little Mexico away from Rocky Point.",

    "text": "We arrived ~5:50pm were greet by a pleasant hostess and seated very quickly.  There were about 10 other people in the restaurant at 4 other tables  Our order taker was very soft spoken and polite, and did not stick around to answer any questions.  But, kept coming back to see if we were ready to order.  My wife chose a taco salad and I selected the combo, 1 taco, 1 enchilada and 1 burro with rice and re-fried beans.  I choose ground beef for the meat...little did I know that's what the filling was to be in everything  Just greasy ground beef.  We were served a small bowl of chips and salsa by another female server.  Chips were good - salsa tasted like Tabasco with a dash of habenaro - yup spicy.  Our order was served within 10 minutes and by a third server, a male.  Again very polite.  My wife's taco salad was good, better than some but not as good as others.  Ground beef was dry but acceptable.  My combo on the other hand was nothing but ground beef in the taco, with lettuce and cheese, and a taco shell that was hard at the top and soggy with grease at the bottom which broken apart when I picked it up.  The enchilada was a grease ground beef enchilada,,,,never had and enchilada with ground beef.  Usually, at other Mexican restaurants when I order an enchilada it has cheese in it.  The burro again was nothing but greasy ground beef...when you cut into the burro it oooozed grease.  The ground beef in my taco, enchilada and burro seemed to be the same seasoning that we get from the grocery store in the taco mix packages.  Portions we acceptable but both mine and my wife lacked the taste we have grown accustomed to in other Mexican restaurants...  Everything was very decorative and clean.  The staff was all polite.  It took us about 30-35 minutes to eat and were ready to go...we were not once bothered by any of the restaurant staff about the food or if there was anything else we needed.  By the time we were ready for the check the restaurant was full. And we waited for another 20 minutes before we could get a server's attention to get our bill.  I'm sure glad we had exact change...",

I don't usually like shredded beef b/c it's usually too tough.  Anaya's was tender and I couldn't believe it was beef!  I'm known to be a slow eater, but I was done before everyone at my table.

Their website lists 2 locations however the BOGO coupon I brought was only good at the 43rd St location per the manager. She said we could have 50% off one entree.  I thought that was ridiculous but didn't feel like arguing.  Not the best deal in town for a Mexican lunch but it could have stayed on my \"safe bet\" list if it hadn't been for that. I probably won't be back...I feel the managers decision was tacky and it cost them a customer. There are so many choices for Mexican in Phoenix.  I use the Entertainment Guide as a compass kind of. I have a hard time trying new places unless it's a great deal. Rarely does this happen with those coupons but when it does, I am instantly turned off. Glad she gave me the 50% because it would have been $30 for 2 basic Mexican lunches. That's too much in my opinion.  If I wanna pay $15 per plate I go to Blue Agave in Scottsdale or some place like that.",

I said that I would call them thanked the gentlemen. He then told me not to worry and said they he would call over to them and place my order, telling me I could pick it up in ten minutes at the other location. I went there in the stated ten minutes and the order was just coming out and was perfect. I cannot highly recommend them enough. Best customer service I have ever received and the food is QUALITY.

They're located at 59th & Thunderbird so it's a super convenient location if you're close to the Glendale / Peoria area.  They're located in a little strip mall so there's plenty of ample parking.  The entrance and entryway are clean and clear.  We were greeted immediately and seated quickly, as well.  Chips and salsa were brought to us very quickly as did our drink order.  The salsa was delicious!  We were both pretty hungry so we scarf the chips down relatively quickly.  Unfortunately, we were never offered or brought another basket of chips like at most Mexican restaurants.  Maybe it's \"one and done\" at Anaya's?  ...I have no idea.  I didn't ask and they didn't offer so I didn't focus on it.  What I did focus on was their vast menu which spans across several pages.  I went with the 2-item combo and opted for a taco and enchilada with shredded beef.  The portions were neither too large nor too small.  The typical refried beans and rice accompanied my dinner.  The taco was delicious topped with plenty of fresh veggies and the enchilada sauce was also flavorful.  Service was quick and attentive.  Prices were reasonable and typical for this kind of establishment.  Definitely glad we gave them a try!",

It's just wonderful.  I wish I could single out my favorite dish, but you can order any item on the menu and rest assured that you will have a great meal. The rellenos are crispy with a scrumptious red sauce, the carnitas melt in your mouth, the mole wonderful, the Sopes are yummy, and the cheese crisp is the absolutely crispiest you'll ever have...I could go on and on.   It is quite an accomplishment to have such an extensive menu and have every dish taste like the specialty of the house. I've been to other restaurants where they have a signals dish, along with few items that are good, but other menu items are just not any good. That isn't the case at Anaya's...Every item on the menu is perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious, you really can't go wrong!  I also can't say enough about the extraordinary staff. They know the menu and how the dishes are prepared something that is extremely helpful for vegetarians and people with dietary issues. I appreciate how they can accommodate and have trained their staff to be aware of different dietary issues more restaurants should be like this. When visiting with my elderly mother they couldn't be sweeter, always helping with the walker, opening the door, etc. You always feel welcome here.  Anaya's is a rare gem in the valley, great food, friendly staff, and wonderful ambience.",

Anaya's is just like any typical Mexican restaurant  but what sets them apart is their food. Full of flavor,fresh and tasty. It's hidden away in some dark shopping center but aren't those usually the best kinds? I've had a few different things on the menu and so has my husband. So far we have had zero issues. This is the kinda Mexican restaurant that you want to try more than the carne asada tacos. You want to try almost everything but it actually looks and sounds good. Menudo is a huge thing for my husband and he says this is the best in the valley. He usually will only eat menudo when we are in Tuscan.",

The Dos Amigos was so delicious and the scallops were actually cooked right! They are moist and tender unlike some places I have been where scallops are dry. The shrimps were also quite delicious. To cap it off ^.^ there were mushrooms in the dish! The sauce really takes the cake, it's sweet and hot with bold flavors all around. I loved everything about it. Again the staff was super friendly and offered to refill waters often and even a second round of chips. I love the atmosphere and how much they make me feel welcomed. I would highly recommend this place.",

I advise trying the non typical recipes like the chipotle chicken, chicken mole, Chile verde, Mexican chicken and arroz con pollo. Everything is gourmet level quality made by your Mexican grandma. Your food comes out of the kitchen on rectangular white plates that accentuate the beauty of the colorful sauces. The flavors can't be beat. A perfect balance of ingredients without the heavy use of cheese and cream some other places hide behind. Please tell all your Mexican friends! This is what we've needed in the West Valley. This is a Glendale find!",

This is a place I am sure to visit many times.  The decor is something everyone needs to experience. The chair backs, the dividers are hand carved and painted festive colors. The atmosphere is relaxing, the employees make you feel at home. Aaaaaaand the tacos were excellent. I ate two but one would of been enough. My next trip will be for breakfast. There is so much on heir menu I want to try.  If you have not visited you need to go see them. You will not regret doing so.   Second trip was for breakfast on Sunday morning. I have upped my star rating to a five. An indication that we got great service and good food. My wife got the pancakes (yes I know not Mexican food or at least Typical). I got the he scrambled eggs mixed with ham and tomatoes. My wife said he pancakes were very fluffy and good. My breakfast was also good. Definitely a place to return for breakfast.  This was a very relaxing breakfast. The noise level is low so it is easy to talk to each other. There is nice Mexican music playing in background. We did not feel rushed in any way and were able just to enjoy.  Already have a third trip planned.",

I read the reviews and decided to try. I probably know just about EVERY mex place in Phx. The food at this place is just \"so so\" with the exception of the salsa.  The salsa is very good. The hot sauce is....different.  It's a cream base and is hot but not a great flavor. I had a red chili burro enchilada style. The red chili has a lot of meat but very little flavor. The enchilada style was sparse and I had even asked for extra sauce. My daughter ordered a burro with a filling that included shredded beef, rice, beans, lettuce, and pico. I cannot remember the name of it. She asked for it with NO beans and enchilada style. Again, the ench style was sparse AND her burro included beans that she does not like and did not want. The shredded beef had very good flavor.  Had to give it a try. Not sure that I would be back.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on the caldo de res. I live down the street from this place and thought about going in but eh. I wanted some caldo because my soup levels were at an all time low but I didn't want to cook it. I decided to see if they made it there, I  called and ordered it to go. Let me just say IT WAS AMAZING!!! This was probably the best Caldo de res I've ever eaten. The meat was soft the broth was flavorful with just a little spice. It has everything in it. Corn on the cob, zucchini, cabbage, carrots, potato. It was just super delicious . I ordered a large and it could have fed two people but I ate all of it. I would have taken a picture but I was in a soup trance. The only thing I would say is slightly negative is there was no corn tortillas and the carrots were huge. But that doesn't change how I feel about it. They did give me a tiny order of chips and salsa and it was good. I'LL BE BACK !!",

The place was clean, the food was fast and the staff were very pleasant! There is a sweet older woman who refills your drinks, she doesn't speak English that well, but the way she makes sure you're taken care of makes you want to come back to the restaurant over and over. Whenever the staff is waiting on you, they are cleaning the restaurant. There was never a moment that I saw any of the employees just lounging around. That makes me as a customer more confident in the quality of the food. Speaking of the food, it was sooooo delicious! They start you off with the chips and salsa, which, I'm a huge wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but that was to die for! ;) Then we were offered the fried ice cream. I've never tried it before but my friend insisted. Like everything else, it's needless to say that it was scrumptious! I could keep raving about this place, but I got to get back to work. Lol!",

The chips and salsa was really good. Fresh chips and salsa had a nice kick to it. It was refreshing because many mexican food restaurants have steered away from their spicier salsa and this restaurant stays True to it. My wife hates spicy and even she enjoyed it. Food was authentic, tacos were good with nice fresh lettuce and tomatoes. No complaints. If your looking to go out and have some food And to be entertained this is not the restaurant, but if you bring a friend or your loved ones it is a nice queit place to enjoy some good mexican food. My wife did order a corona rita and they hardly put any alcohol in it besides the beer and it was 8$ so that is the reason im only giving 4 stars. Drink was expensive and my wife only weighs 115 lbs and didnt even get a tiny little buzz going. But as for food it was really good",

My lady and I love margaritas, you must try the fresh margarita. Made with fresh lime juice, and agave. Again amazing. Its a family owned resturant with wonderful people and great service. My advise is drop what your doing and go eat at this place.",

It was seven very large shrimp and a load of sauteed mushrooms in a delicious  butter garlic sauce served with rice and salad. I wanted to take some home but I couldn't stop eating it it was so good. The shrimp are amazingly large and the dish is great for garlic lovers. The quality of the food in this this dish  alone indicated to me that this is a fine restaurant using top quality food prepared flawlessly. My next trip, based on the suggestion of the waitress,  was arroz con pollo, basically a chicken and veggie stew served over rice. It usually comes with a cheese topping but I held the cheese. It was amazingly delicious to the point of being close to orgasmic. Check that, it was orgasmic. This is the comfort dish my Hungarian grandmother would make if she was Mexican. It will be hard for me to order anything else after trying this dish.  It was enough for two meals, I enjoyed it a second night at home as much as the first.",

The chips and salsa were some of the best I have had with the perfect amount of heat.  The margaritas were excellent. We tried the skinny margarita and the original. Both awesome and strong.  I would for sure recommend this place for happy hour.  Next time I am back in Phoenix I would for sure go back for drinks and some appetizers.  I was not impressed with my street tacos at all. The corn tortillas tasted store bought and the meat was not the greatest quality.  I had the asada and the pastor.  Both were just ok.  I would not order again.  The tamale was tasty as well as the refried beans.  My sweets did enjoy his meal.  All in all this is a nice and comfortable spot to sit back and relax with friendly service, strong drinks and average food.",

They bring out chips and salsa and no plates so you better not get salsa all over you.. The salsa is very spicy I love spicy so it didn't bother me but for others that will attend this place and you don't like spicy you won't like the salsa. The menu is simple and they explain everything. We ordered the cheese Quesadilla for the appetizer and it was very tasty and fresh.. I love carne asada so I wanted a carne asada burrito and the girl said we don't have that but we have carne asada tacos.. Haha why can't you just put that same meat inside of a burrito??.. So I ended up getting some shrimp enchilada or something like that it wasn't that good the shrimp still had the shell on them which was really gross made me think what kind of shrimp are they and how cheap are they? Also I asked for the Mexican soda and they said they just had regular fountain drinks... If you're going to have a Mexican food joint you need carne Asada burritos and Mexican soda.. Place is dark, the salsa is spicy, and they don't got the Cheeseburger of burritos the Carne Asada burrito. Also the tables and chairs are weird.. Only one Waitress working for 4 tables..",

The tamale was filled with meat and so moist, the sauce on the enchilada was perfect and my shredded beef taco was crispy and had a ton of flavor. I cant begin to tell you how much I love this place. We moved here 5 weeks ago and have been here 4 times. That is a big deal, because we live an hour away. so yes, we take a 2 hour round trip because it is just that good. They also have a great beer and tequila selection and the customer service is always top notch.",

Totally cool atmosphere, great chairs great Decor, couldn't say more about it! The host was in an especially great mood, sat us down super fast, and then the waitress took over and again great customer service! Got an opportunity to order the perfect margarita,(order the skinny, which is the real deal! Agave, Triple Sec, lime juice and tequila!) Great tequila selection, and amazing Foods, including real Hatch Green Chile items! I got an opportunity to taste the Menudo, no joke, best menudo I've ever tasted! The hominy had a nice home-made taste, a little toasty, super-delish! Got the crispy tacos, and they were just OK., not bad but in hindsight I think I'm going to go for the street tacos next time! I also ordered the relleno, and it was okay, again not bad, and I'll order it definitely again, but it was just ok. The one thing this place is missing, is a good salsa. I tried several that they had and unfortunately they just have a good spicy flavorful salsa that I could enjoy. That however, did not take away from my experience! This is really good food in the middle of North Glendale! Anyway, such a blessing to be able to eat here tonight! If you do one thing while you're in Glendale, come check this place out!",

I used to think Popo's was that place, but have gotten more and more irritated with that place -- oversized portions, chewy overcooked meat, watered down drinks.

I have spent time plenty of time in Mexico, and enjoyed the different flavors of Mexico. This restaurant stays True to the flavors of the south. They serve up traditional dishes of the Puerto Vallarta as well as other popular dishes found throughout Mexico. The restaurant is quaint, but as festive as you could expect from a restaurant whose roots are from a beautiful beach state. Phoenix offers many Mexican food restaurants to eat at, but many are tainted with flavors of Arizona. This place is an awesome treat for those of us who are seeking a more traditional dish meal like you would find in mexico. If you are looking for a deviation from a chain restaurant you really need to try this place.  Cons: The only place I find this restaurant to fall short is on their wait staff. They seem to be a little impatient when you have questions or want to share how great your experience is. This can be a mood killer when the service doesn't match the great taste of the food. I mention this because on several occasions the waiters rush off to the kitchen before we can complete our inquiries. The dining area is only about 1000 sqft. It has been after lunch when we visit so it has been slow. I am writing this in hopes that it's owners or management will tell them to be a little more patient and curteous to patrons.",
