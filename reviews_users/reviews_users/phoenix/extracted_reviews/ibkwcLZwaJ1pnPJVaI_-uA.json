    "text": "I haven't been to this place in a while-- I was contracting at Intel and this was a nice spot to hit for lunch, so I went several times over the course of 3 months, and from a convenience standpoint it certainly had a great taste-to-distance ratio.  There were basically two minuses that subtracted from my experience there.  First, maybe because they are catering to a business lunch crowd that isn't familiar with more authentic Thai seasonings or-- well, I don't really know-- their food tended to be overly sweet.  The pad thai was very sweet, such that someone I brought there for lunch was almost unable to finish it.  The yellow curry (one of my favorites) was also cooked such that the curry itself was discolored, with brown flecks-- I was told by another Thai cook that this is from over-cooking some part of the mix, but I'm afraid I can't help past there (though it did not taste burned and it didn't actually taste bad, it just tasted \"off\").  Second, this is the second location as far as I know and it definitely lacked some atmosphere.  It felt more like a generic restaurant with some Thai decor thrown in for good measure.  The first location is a little bit more quaint, and the people working there seemed slightly more relaxed-- since that first location is not in the same sort of business-centric area, it's entirely possible that the faster pace of this second location is just part of doing business.  Anyway, for a quick Thai lunch in the Chandler area it's not a bad choice at all.  I just think if you're looking for a serious Thai meal, that this one strays a tad too much from authenticity.",

It can get very busy, but the staff does a great job of providing top notch service even when packed.  I am not an expert on Thai food, but I have not tried anything there that wasn't outstanding.  It is really hard to come up with a favorite, just try any of the lunch specials and you can't go wrong.  One word of warning, they let you pick your level of spiciness, and I find that if you are sensitive to spicy food, you might want to be a bit conservative.",

The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there, and they must have packaged it *really* well (or made it super hot) because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later. We didn't try anything new (just the Pad Thai and duck curry, our favorites from last time), but it was just as delicious. The only change I made was ordering our curry \"5\" (on the 1 to 5 spiciness scale) - it was definitely hot but not as hot as we would get in the Bay Area when we asked for spicy. Can't wait to go back again!",

The food: I've sampled various veggie and seafood options, and they've all been equally delicious. Since I've never been inside for more than a few minutes, I can't really vouch for the atmosphere or the service, but I stand by the food.

    "text": "tI recently relocated to Phoenix from Silicon Valley, where there are fantastic Thai restaurants pretty much everywhere.  I decided to try Swaddee based on reviews here.  This is my opinion on what I tried:  1. Tom Ka Gai Soup:  To be fair, I am comparing this dish to what is generally considered to be the BEST Tom Ka Gai in the SF Bay Area (Dusita Thai in Sunnyvale).  I'd give this dish a 4/5.  The flavor was spot on, but light on ingredients.  Also, they didn't use those little button mushrooms, and for the $ they are charging, I think it should have the correct mushrooms! 2. Green Curry:  5/5.  Superb.  Fabulous.  They could add some eggplant though. 3. Spicy Fried Rice:  4.5/5.  The flavor was good, it was cooked properly.  If they offered it with crab, it would be mind blowing. 4. Green Papaya Salad:  3/5.  I was disappointed that the sauce wasn't quite right.  I don't know what makes the dressing so tangy, but they should use more of whatever that is! 5. Spiciness:  I order my Thai food as 'Thai Spicy'.  Seriously, restaurants will question me repeatedly because they are afraid to serve it to me the way I like it.  I ordered everything except the Green Papaya Salad as a '5', which is supposed to be their Thai spicy.  Not so.  They would have had to double it to give me what I was expecting.    That said, it was quite good and I will return.  However, I'm going to try a few other places first...............",

    "text": "My boyfriend has been talking about this place since I've known him and today when we were weeding in the yard something smelled like green curry (I know this sounds weird, but this is how my brain works, don't ask) and that was it, I had the bug, I needed Thai food. The lady who greeted us was very nice, and was the same person who served us and cashed us out for that matter. Decor was fairly standard for a Thai food place, including the compulsory fish tank right in the middle of the room. My boyfriend had his absolute favorite Pad See Ew. Which he enjoyed as always. I had the Green Curry with chicken. We both opted for the 1 star spiciness, I think the server laughed at that, but c'mon, I'm Finnish and French-Canadian here lady, my palate is not made for Thai spice! It was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and that good, creamy, warm green curry flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked so they still had that crunch. Maybe it was because I wasn't paying, or maybe it's because I've been desensitized by East Coast prices but I thought that $24+tip for the amount of food that we got was perfectly reasonable. I think it's a solid place.   Sidenote: I see that most people have responded \"No\" for delivery, however on their website, for this location it says \"Call and ask about free delivery\" so I don't know if it's new, or just lesser known.",

I've had times when the pad Thai, at a 3, is more than I can handle. At other times, I've ordered a curry at \"medium\" only to find out it's not spicy in the least... Basically, I think this place is a solid choice for Thai, but it's by no means earth-shattering or anything like that. I actually like the lunch options better than dinner here. The first few times I've eaten at Swaddee's have  all been at lunch, and I've been impressed. But then I ordered the Panang curry to-go, for dinner. I asked for it with tofu, and I got a curry with tofu and onions. That's it. No veggies, nothing. That's really odd for a Thai restaurant. It wasn't flavorful, either. Then I went here last week for dinner, and ordered pad Thai. The noodles were a bit dry and hard, although I have to say, the service was great. All in all, I think I'll continue to come here for lunch, but when it comes to dinner, I'll probably try to seek out some new Thai restaurants.",

I've had all the curries and every time the spiciness is different even though I ask for a 3.  Sometimes it's not spicy at all and sometimes it's so spicy that my mouth burns.    I've had the eggplant with chicken, but the chicken isn't as moist and tender as I hoped meat would taste like. They chopped up the chicken in very small pieces and seemed overcooked.  I would stick with the different types of curries (red, green, yellow) though.  It's safer.  The curry sauce would seep into the meat and make it more tender. The curries can also be different textures.  I've had it where it's thick and creamy (the way I like it) or more watered down.  The lunch portions are pretty small, but I guess it's enough for a lunch meal.    Beware Swaddee's if you're not too comfortable with spicy.  Just order a lower number and you can add more chili if it's not spicy enough for you.  I still would recommend this place and try your luck with the food here.  You may get lucky and have a great meal.",

Drinks: Thai coffee 4* Appetizer : Chicken Satay 2.5*, personally i felt that taste was ok and chicken was not cooked tender  Entree : Drunken noodles  The quantity was really good. Its good i stick with the spice level of 3/5. If you don't eat spice stick with 2 :). I have tried drunken noodles at many thai places so the taste here felt little low, color of the dish reflected something was missing in it. I will surely rate this dish higher on some other Thai places.  Overall if you are near this place and want to try thai not a bad choice :).",

Not enough people working to accommodate the traffic.  Twice,  it was the same thing! We came in a group of 5 people the first time and 3 the second time. Both were on Saturday nights.  There were 3 people working in the front the first time and this time only 2.  The restaurant was packed.  Even other tables were waiting for their food as well. They did try to get your drinks as soon as possible but it took them forever to get your order and the food out.  Love the food and everything else but I won't be back because of the wait time.",

I asked them to wash it. She told the other girl that my boy did it. My wife got up and told them my son was across the table in a high chair. What kind of person blames a little kid??

They are the nicest restaurant proprietors this side of Thailand! The food is spectacularly delicious! We always have the Tom Ka soup, one with chicken and one with tofu. For 5 of us, we did have a wee bit left over to take home: We also indulged with two of the lightly battered deep fried tempura, Thai basil noodles, two sweet and two sour shrimp, and a bowl of vege in yellow curry. For five people we enjoyed a feast of the most delectible Thai food. I have been to so many Thai restaurants, but this one has the best food, and service.

The lunch specials are a really good deal, at only $8 for a large portion, salad, and egg roll! (The salad and egg roll weren't that impressive though)  I really liked the flavor of the pad thai (and that it came with peanuts!), but was disappointed because the pad see ew was really over-sauced. The green curry was good, but nothing special. So I would recommend the pad thai. The staff was also very friendly, and there's a 10% discount if you pay in cash!",

For some strange reason, Thai food has been on the list of things that I just hadn't ventured out to try here, assuming there's no way it could live up to how great the options were in Seattle.  Then, for a co-workers birthday, I went here.  Not only was I immediately impressed with the service, the waitress recommended Thai iced tea - and it was just delicious.  I got the Pad See Ew w/ beef (5 stars 'cause that's how I roll) and it was fantastical.  The lunch special (like $8) also came with a small spring roll - which I dipped in the leftover peanut salad dressing.. just wow.  So, A for ambiance, service, and perfect Thai cuisine on a very busy Friday lunch.  Brian talk Thai - Brian talk Thai VERY good.",

She seemed to understand I meant ACTUALLY hot, not wimpy person hot.   I also ordered a Thai Iced Tea.  It was fabulous.    My pad thai was HUGE and delicious. I did end up adding a few more spoonfuls of red chili paste, but I initially underestimated the heat level. It did build up on me!  Did I mention the portion size was HUGE?!  After eating far more than I should have eaten, I had an entire styrofoam container of food left over.  Yeah. It was that big.   The service was great.  The ladies working there were friendly.  On the way out, I noticed one of the ladies was rolling the spring rolls by hand on a table.  She had lots to make.  They were all perfect and uniform in size. It was funny because at dinner I was talking about how perfect my grandfather made lumpia. It was just like that!    I will return to Swaddee... soon!",

The appetizer was OK. The cook didn't even bother to trim the cabbage leaves of the old wilted parts, which substracted from the experience. The pieces of beef were cut a bit too thick, and they were a bit too salty.   The chicken vegetable stir fry was delicious and tasty. We had to add a bit more dried red pepper to both dishes as we found neither spicy enough.   The best dish was the desert - golden banana, which were 2 pieces of banana and shredded coconut wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. We requested an additional scoop of coconut ice cream for an additional charge. Totally worth it.   We will be back to try other dishes.",

The cool thing about this place is that you get to choose how spicy your food is. They use a 1-5 scale, 5 being the spiciest. The 2 is a moderate medium. I haven't ventured past that.

My family and I were placed in a corner (when the entire restaurant was pretty much vacant) next to another family with a baby in a highchair. This created kind of an uncomfortable space for us to even enjoy our meal. I thought the food was terrible (ie, the duck that I bit into was extremely salty, and even bit into salt during each bite. My duck was burnt as well). The service was VERY POOR- with three tables out of the many you have available in the restaurant, and the number of waiters, I'd think we would have exceptional service. I was wrong. Our waiter was in the back eating a meal. At a table. In front of all customers.  I have never wanted to leave a restaurant without consuming my food. This was the first time. Doggy bag? NO THANK YOU. If I could give zero stars, I would. For restaurant-goers looking for actual good and decent food, do not go here.",

    "text": "Overall I enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere here, but they fell short of 4 stars for me.  We were served in somewhat of a tag-team style, there were probably 3-4 different people waiting on us.  I thought that was a bit unusual.  The staff was friendly if a bit aloof.  We did have a spill at our table (yes it was me again, but no drinking was involved this time) which they could have handled better.  We had Pad Thai and an appetizer sampler-I forget what that was called.  The Pad Thai was heavily flavored and the sauce was kind of heavy.  I prefer a lighter sauce for the Pad Thai-it should not be a heavy dish like Alfredo.  The apps were good, particularly the Satay.  The Spring Rolls were overly oily.  I consider the prices here to be a bit high for Thai food as I've had so much great Thai food for very reasonable prices.  If I'm paying 12 bucks for a noodle dish it had better be excellent, not just good.",

It came in smallish round bowl.  I did appreciate the fact that they did make my meal quite spicy when I asked for it.  This place is decent but there are better options in the neighborhood.",

The tofu is always cooked perfectly and I've heard the chicken is great too.  I usually get either the yellow curry or the pad thai. Both of them come in epic preportions and I have lunch for the next day. The tom kha soup is delicious!  Go for the lunch special, it's cheap and the portions are still huge.

    "text": "When I think of Thai food, I think of Swadee. Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.  So it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.  The first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.  The second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it).   Well, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.  And as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!  I understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen.   The staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "I was craving Thai like no other today (go figure) after passing Tipps 88 in Tempe while running errands. Seeing that it's closed on Sundays (thanks Gabi!) I convinced a friend (okay it didn't take any convincing at all) to head to Swaddee in our continuing search for best Thai food in Phoenix.  Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it.   We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert.   I'm glad to have finally found another Thai restaurant other than Malee's I can call home!",

Been there bunch of times for lunch from work and once for dinner. Dinner was better. Lunch is fine. Do not believe their star rating, 5 will NOT burn your eyes out.   Now, is it best Thai ever? Noup, it aint. Is it best in the neighborhood? MAYBE! However is you are willing to go a few miles West into Foothills you will find Thai Basil which i think quite a bit better.   Now, there we have it. Efff me and my effing opinions :)  \"Its awight\"  Eugene",

They do tag team and I don't think they speak a ton of excellent English, which is why they are pretty quiet.  I don't mind that, as you get to eat your food in peace!

Always order a Thai Iced Tea... because it is some sort of sugar coma inducing tradition.  Delicious.  But to the main reason I'm writing this review!!!  PAD THAI.  The shrimp are always plump... the noodles are always just right... the seasoning is exactly what I want and need out of my Pad Thai dish.  The bean sprouts are crunchy and wonderful.  I'm a wimp & I get zero to none spicy because I can't take it otherwise & it's usually still spicy?  I think they do that just to spite me.  I've had their pineapple fried rice before which I would describe as... Meeeh.  Take it or leave it.  I think I found two and a half chunks of pineapple within the rice.

The green and red curries are delectable and can be made as mild or as spicy as your palate (and non-asbestos coated tongue) can handle. 1 is mild, 2 is considered medium, and 5 is Three-Mile Island hot (don't do this if you truly like yourself or even just marginally like yourself).   If you do decide to go, the evenings are not quite as busy as lunchtime. If you choose to try Swaddee during your lunch hour, then I highly suggest that you get there as soon as it opens for lunch, because Intel is right next door and many employees opt to eat at Swaddee.   Also, if you plan on bringing kids with you to the restaurant, then be careful which tables you sit at because some have piccies of scantily-clad (some nekked) ladies. I was forced to strategically place some condiments over one of the said scantily-clad ladies in a bit of a hurry just  recently.",

I had lunch there this past weekend, and after not having there for a couple of months, it reminded me why I like the food so much.  The truth is that I usually stick to three of me favorite dishes every time I go.  I usually get my food pretty spicy, a 4 from a range of one to five.  The vegetarian options are excellent, as most Thai restaurants can prepare most dishes as vegetarian.  My favorite dish in the menu is yellow curry, which is a mix of vegetables in a curry sauce, with rice on the side.  I also really like their spicy noodles.  It may not sound as terribly adventurous, but it has lots of flavor.  It is also a dish that would go very well with most people who are new to Thai food. And my other favorite is Tom Yum soup, which is hot and sour.  I have taken several friend to this restaurant and they have not been disappointed.  And for those who are not sure about Thai food I always suggest that they start with the spicy noodles.  The noodles can be prepared with very little spice if requested that way.  For a long time, I have been telling myself that I would write a review for this restaurant. Done!",

    "text": "I took a break from this restaurant for about 2 yrs because of bad service. Decided to return tonight. It was a total mistake. The waitress took us to our seat and left. Seconds later she sat a couple behind us. 10 or so minutes later she came over to us. I told her we were ready to order. We were told she will be back to get our order because she has to ask her coworker if the couple sitting in front of us has been taken care of. I thought that was rude, but let it slide. About 10 minutes later she came and took our order. Now, in between this, the couple  behind us has their water. After a few minutes more, we got our water. Then our order came, but one was wrong. After talking it through, she admitted she wrote it down wrong (she looked at her order sheet). The couple behind us got their water, their food, their utensils, and extra plates. We reminded our waitress 3x we needed our utensils so we can start eating. In between this, we don't even have any napkins. When we finally got our napkins, still no utensils. My hub went to the front and had to wait to get our utensils. When the correct food came, it was WTF moment because the food was not done correctly. So my kids ended up eating the incorrect food with no extra plates. Our water glasses were all empty. We waited for a while. My son said he was thirsty. By now I am mad. I went to ask the waitress if I can grab the water pitcher. She gave me an indecisive look and never responded. Needless to say I grabbed it and refilled our glasses myself. I will say I am 100% sure we will never returned. I will say this. The couple in front and behind us are Caucasian. If you tell me it is not a race issue, I will wholeheartedly refute that. I see the waitress bend over backwards to please these two couples while we are neglected.",

Bring out the food and 5min later she bring us the check without saying anything, and every time I raised my hand to ask for something, she saw me but then ignore and look away. The whole time, no greeting, no saying thanks you, nothing. We end up leaving the tips for the kitchen, instead of the servers because we received the worst service ever.",

It's charges 18% automatically for parties of five. I think it should be 6 especially since I have three young kids. I understand it their policy but I think they are tryin to make people automatically forced to pay more. Also, I asked for side of white rice for our party of five and they charged $8 for white rice. That is ridiculous.  Most restaurants charge $4-5 which I think is a fair price. I can buy a 10lb bag of rice for $10! Not sure I will be back.",

They have dinner specials for about 9$ that comes with a salad with peanut dressing, an entree and a spring roll...not a bad deal. Also, the portion is large, I had more than enough for lunch the next day (and the flavors were better the next day too). I had the spicy noodles at a 3.5 heat level and it was spicy, but not burning my face off. My friend had the pad se ew and she thought it was ok... nothing special. At the end, we wanted to try the raved about coconut ice cream, but they brought our check without asking about dessert and promptly disappeared... so that was that. This probably wouldn't be my first choice of Thai in the area, but I would go back.   PS When I walked in, I almost had a heart attack because they had an ATM sitting there... is this place cash only?!?! Oh no!.... No, they do take cards...phew!",

She talked as if she was annoyed. When I paid, she gave me both receipts with my card, slammed a pen in front of me to sign a receipt and left. I was standing there with a signed receipt, a pen upset. She was too busy sitting down at a table and talking to another server. Then a guy saw it, came to me running and said thank you and took care of it. Such an unacceptable behavior. Totally ruined my day. Food tasted good, but for some reason gave me a stomachache.

I guess now that I've been exposed to really wonderful, flavorful Thai, your restaurant just isn't as appealing to me as it was 10 years ago.  My husband and I dined at the Chandler location recently since it's near his work. He got the house salad which was just a standard salad with bland peanut dressing. What upset him is that the \"shrimp\" listed in the description was just that-- ONE SHRIMP, singular.  I got the spicy eggplant figuring that would be a good choice since eggplant is in season. It was just ok. I tasted more grease than anything else, but I was missing all those hot/sour/sweet/bitter elements that I expect with Thai food.  Luckily there are other Thai places in the area.

The first time, it came out with no potatoes. I asked if they perhaps didn't have potatoes. She apologized and asked if she could take it back. It came back with ~4 small potato halves in it. Not what I expected. The curry was ok, but it's extra watery and the flavors aren't absorbed by the vegetables.   The wine came out after the food. You get a 10% discount if you pay in cash, but all together this was $20 with the tip.",

The lunch special includes a generous portion of curry, a mound of white rice, salad, and a tiny little egg roll. The egg roll had a ton of wrapping with a small amount of filling. The rice was very slightly crunchy tasting in some parts. The red curry was lighter and a little sweeter tasting than other versions I've had and was watery. The salad had a peanut dressing on it which tasted decent.  The tom kha gai was also a sizeable portion of soup, filled with chicken and vegetables. The soup was actually thicker than the curry, and had a strong sour flavor.   Service was friendly and polite at the counter.  I asked for both dishes 4 out of 5 in terms of spiciness but they turned out more like mild/medium say like 2-3 level to me.   Overall they have good portions and friendly service but the food is about average.",

I was visiting my in-laws and wanted to grab sticky rice for my son since I didn't have the stuff to make it myself. It's $3 for one order. The lady there told me it wasn't much rice, so I ordered two orders.  She was honest about it being a small portion, so I wasn't too upset about that. I was annoyed that one of the two tiny orders wasn't even edible. I got the bottom of the warmer/dried out sticky rice. My two year old could eat a whole order himself - their portions were that small. I had to throw out a whole order and my son ate the entire second order.  I may be a sticky rice snob but even for ppl who aren't sticky rice snobs...if you're guna charge $3/order, make it worth $3.",

The food tastes great, portions are large, and the value (lunch specials on weekdays) is amazing. My favorite dish from them is the pad Thai, which is perfectly cooked. I would also recommend the yellow curry, pad see ew, and spicy noodles. The pineapple fried rice is also wonderful. I have also had other dishes, but these are the ones that I love most. Service and the environment are perfect for nice occasions or just casual eating.   Over the years, the spicy scale of 1-5 is not very consistent unless you are on the 1 side.",

I ordered take out of yellow curry with potatoes and chicken with fried rice which by the way was 25 bucks for one person.  25 bucks at a grocery store for one person can go a far way.  Next, it came in a container which 95% was the yellow curry liquid.  I came with 3 pieces of chicken and one potato.  This is full truth..  I even dumped the liquid out and even pieced the potato together and three pieces of chicken.  The rest was green pepper.  So bad.  Experience: Have had Thai all over the USA AND Thailand.  Yup, I got ripped off and obviously these people don't mind getting ripped of with the high reviews.   100% Truth to this review.  You've been warned.",

    "text": "We went by Swaddee for dinner on a Friday night and there were only a couple of people there ... Really surprised it wasn't busy based on the reviews. I think I'd give this restaurant more of a 2.5 but I rounded up.  Obviously we were seated right away, and soon after, we placed our order and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We got the Swaddee Fried Rice (medium spice) and the Cashew Nuts Delight (medium hot spice). The Cashew Nuts Delight definitely had a kick to it and was really tasty. I thought that there were a lot of cashews in there but too many vegetables compared to chicken. The Swaddee Fried Rice was almost too sweet with the pineapple (which it doesn't say it has in it on the menu, I think?), raisins, and Chinese Sausage. We had gotten a glass of the Thai Tea as well; it was $2.50 and came in a much smaller glass than it does at other restaurants.  I thought that the prices were a bit higher for the entrees than other places, but the portion sizes were maybe larger than at other places. Not sure when/if we will be back. With so many other Thai restaurants to pick from, we'll venture to try something different in the future.",

    "text": "Swaddee Thai has the best Thai food I have tasted in Arizona. The flavors are on point, the rice cooked well (not too soft/mushy, not dry).   My friend had been going here for years and introduced me to this place last year when I first moved to Arizona.   Service:  The staff is very welcoming and the restaurant has great customer service. The servers are always smiling, are patient, frequently fill your water glasses, and ask if you need anything throughout your meal.   Ambiance:  The ambiance at this restaurant is romantic with Thai silk paintings and decor on all the walls. There's a large fish tank in the middle of the room as well.   Food:  *Papaya Salad* - WARNING! This dish is already pretty spicy, so I would recommend a Spicy Level of 1 or 2 for this appetizer if you can handle spicy food, but don't want your tongue or throat to burn. Definitely ask for the least amount of spice for this one. It's one of my favorites. Healthy and refreshing, it's the perfect appetizer to a heavy Thai meal to follow.   --All the curries are so delicious! Generous portions, not too watery, and the meat is cooked so well.  *Red Curry Chicken* My all-time favorite. You can taste the coconut milk more in this, the green, and the yellow curries more than the panang curry.  *Panang Curry Chicken* Has more Indian flavors, the sliced onion  *Massaman Curry* add more peanuts to your liking!  *Pad Thai* I always order pad thai with a side of fried tofu and share it with a friend. The portions are huge, so ordering 2-3 items and sharing them is smart. The noodles are cooked well, not too thick or thin, just right, and soaked in a delicious peanut sauce. My friends and I always ask for more peanuts on the side as well. The Pad Thai doesn't get as spicy as the papaya salad, so I recommend a 4-5 spicy level if you like it spicy!",

The Shrimp Curry is my go to and I like my food spicy so I usually do 4/5 stars and then brown rice instead of white rice. I have tried almost all of the lunch specials and they are all delicious especially their red curries and noodle dishes! You always get a small salad with peanut sauce and a spring roll with your lunch special and if you have room for dessert you NEED to try their Coconut Ice Cream.

We came across Swaddee Thai up there and loved the food so much we knew we had to check out the other location which was coincidentally right in our backyard. Fast forward and when it came to my wife's birthday, she requested Thai so we knew exactly where to go! The food was just as delicious as the location up north. The Pad Thai was just the right amount of spicy. The Tom Kah soup was downright heavenly (I could've gone for another bowl myself!). The service was fantastic and really homey--made you feel like you were in a Thai family's home kitchen! Needless to say, birthday dinner was a great success.  Oh and I can't forget about that Thai iced tea! But I definitely recommend ordering it to be served with your main dishes, as it will be waaay too tempting to drink it all before your food arrives if they serve it first.",

AND, what the....no apology but they gave us attitude before we left the restaurant, what kind of business is this???? If we ever get sick by one bite on that chicken by tomorrow, they will be in trouble....!!!!!",

We ordered the Tom Kha hot pot #25, Pad See Ew Chicken #65, Thai BBQ chicken #31, and Papaya Salad #14.  It was all very appetizing. Everything had the right amount of spice. We were very satisfied. The spice is out of a 5 and majority of the dishes were 3-4. Next time I'll try the 5 to see how spicy it is.  The service was a 3 out of 5 stars. He took our order and went about his way.

Roasted duck was not up to the mark, the duck was way dry and flaky. Pad thai though on a level 4 of spice was way sweet to my taste. The food color or the sauce color didn't impress me, it was an ok dish.  I am not totally going with the place nor am I letting it down. The price is average and ok for quick lunch.",

The food came quickly, and was good. Everything was cooked perfectly, the veggies and rice. The Sweet and Sour sauce was well balanced; I'd probably get a level up on the spice next time. The portion size was perfect. One of my only complaints was that our server was absent most of the time, she filled drinks once.",

My friend and I, felt that the 5/5 level of spicy was the way to go, and it was waay too intense. Every bite was painfully delicious, and honestly quite frustrating. I was sweating and kinda felt like I had just taken a bongload (of bammer). I had to shower my body after that meal, but overall it was delightful. I would just recommend sticking w/ a low level of spice, and I love me some spice.",

I was weeping with hot chili joy (eek - bad description, but you get the point!). The soup had a small amount of coconut in it, but was not heavy and rich where you cannot eat anything else. I chose the red curry chicken from the lunch menu at a level 3 spiciness - that was a perfect amount of heat for me! Even though the place was packed, our food came quickly and was piping hot.

    "text": "I agree with alot of reviewers that this place was \"awight\". I didn't bother looking at the reviews before I went-I was just following my aunt's suggestion so we made plans as a family (with my parents in town) to eat there. I looked at the menu and was 'thrilled' to find a vegetarian section, and the family didn't consciously find a restaurant that is vegetarian-friendly for me (talk about jewish guilt trip). So I went with much anticipation (a sad symptom of vegetarianism in a meat-eating world when you discover that a restaurant has a vegetarian dish and are quick to assume that the dish will be DELICIOUS. It sucks that you're not able to choose from a variety of selections, but Not ALL vegetarian dishes are delicious. I'm working on this. Smile). Well, the dishes didn't BLOW me away-it was  *half-smirk* eatable. I ordered a hot and sour soup with tofu (Tom Yum), which was good. Then I ate Tofu Coconut Princess with #2 spicy (they have a 5-rating spice scale), and it WAS not spicy at all (and my aunt warned that #2 is VERY spicy), and the tofu was overcooked. Lucikly, the coconut was able to compensate for that. I brought home the leftover for my boyfriend, and he has a very critical palate since he's a cook-he wasn't impressed with it. The dishes are OVER-PRICED for what they're worth if I had to pay (my dad had to foot the bill for a party of 6).  I'm a bit surprised of the awards they've received-what was the criterion? Is a vegetarian on the committee of \"Best of Phoenix\"? That's what I would like to know.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has high expectations of food.",

I have tried the yellow curry and the pad thai.  Both were fresh and flavorful.  The yellow curry is one of the best I've had.  It is a good blend of spice and coconut milk.  The price is reasonable - $7 for salad, egg roll, curry and rice.  Not much to say about the decor.  The restaurant can use some sprucing up.

Lunch time is pretty much chaos with entire Intel staff taking over, but it's also the best deal (lunch specials are all under $6).  Dinner prices are on the high side, because the portions are almost identical to lunch but it is much more tame and less crowded at night.

The service is either great or slow, and the heat ratings varies enough that you can be surprised.  The decor isn't fancy and it's hard to find from the street.  Now that being said, the food is always great and across multiple dishes on the menu.  I'm always satisfied with my lunch.    It gets busy every week day during lunch because of the Intel crowd so show up before noon.  For dinner and the weekends, it's never that busy, so a great time to go if you have time.",

I recently moved slightly closer to Swaddee, and a visit seemed inevitable, in part, due to the location in a strip mall next to Zoyo.  Overall, it was okay.  We entered a little after five and were the only patrons.   A few guests joined us and there seemed to be a few to go orders.  Our waitress was Thai and accommodating to my family's dietary proclivities.  The food was entirely unremarkable. My green curry, the dish I eat always order and use to judge all Thai restaurants, was watery and bland.  My wife was in full agreement with my tepid evaluation.  My daughter didn't seem particularly excited either.",

I had time to spare until my next appt. of the day, so I hung around for 1 hr 10 minutes to observe for my Review. :) At 11:30am partrons started coming for their to go and walk-ins rolled in. Man is this place hopping. I watched 25 to go orders and 20 seated inside in the short time I was there.  I ordered my usual from Pei Wei - the Pad Thai. Hands down, *the best.* Now, Pei Wei is a slight glimmer of hope of my return. The Pad Thai was not greasy,.felt fresh and not sticky. The spicy scale from 1 to 5, I choose 1. Glad I did as was enough for me. Can't imagine a 4 for 5. :) They didn't charge me for the Thai Tea (I ordered because of reviews here) and it is an acquired taste for some people if they are not familiar -- I really liked it. For dessert, Coconut Ice Cream **Note: topped with peanuts...not a good idea to me; kills the coconut flavor.  I will be back. And given the distance, that says something. :)",

The prices for lunch and dinner specials are reasonable (the only times I go, because I am still a broke college student). Lunch and dinner specials come with a spring roll and a salad, so it's a nice meal. Lunch and dinner special times can get a little crazy, often with lines going out the door, so I usually go after the peak rush times. This results in a quieter atmosphere and food delivered to the table within 10 minutes of ordering, if not quicker.  The other dishes on the menu, while tasty, are a little on the expensive side for me ($10-$12) and not in portions large enough to justify spending that much.   Other items on the menu such as coconut ice cream and Thai iced tea also do not disappoint. The appetizers are tasty and the soups pack quite a punch in terms of flavor.   One thing I have noticed, though, is that the spiciness scale tends to be all over the place. One time's 4 is another visit's 2 is another visit's 5. So be warned!  Basically, go there for a delicious, affordable meal at lunch or dinnertime, but try to beat the rush if you can.",

I got the red curry beef, and red curry is the first dish I try to order at Thai places to test their tastiness. I order it 10 stars, or double Thai hot. Yeah, I'm weird, I know. It was very good, but at $10.95, it looked more like the portion I see for lunch everywhere else.  Boyfriend got the beef chow mein, which was a bigger portion and was pretty good. Nothing to yelp about, but he liked it. The pad thai was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit mushy. The plate was huge, and so I figured they made up for my dish with my friend's. I didn't need to eat that much, anyway.  Others got the spicy basil, which got mixed reviews, the panang curry and the spicy basil with eggplant. The latter was really good from the bites I took, while I think the panang was good but not over the top. Another got the thai barbecued chicken, which must have been good because it was almost gone at the end of dinner. It's on fire when they bring it out, so that's fun.   I wanted to rate Swaddee a 3.5, but service was great, so here's a 4. Malee's is still the best on my list, followed by Yupha's and then a tie between Lemongrass and Thai Basil.  Props for being one of the few Thai places in Chandler. Since there are many in my area, I really enjoy living in Tempe. :)",

Several people were also sitting with no food. Uh oh, not a good sign. We ordered the Lunch specials which we assumed would be quick. NOT. We never got our salads and after 40 minutes, asked for our order to go which totally confused everyone at the counter. We still got charged for the drinks we abandoned and the missing salads. No apologies either.  As for the food, the Yellow Curry Chicken was ok, nothing to special, actually a little too sweet. The Red Curry Beef was pretty bad. There wasn't nearly enough meat but that's probably a good thing since it was as chewy as \"an old truck bench seat cover\" according to my husband. The egg roll was the size of a my pinky finger and was a joke.  All of the Best Of reviews appear to be from awhile time ago...  Doesn't matter, I'm not going back.",

We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.  Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!",

It is my favorite Thai Tea from all of the thai restaurants in the valley.  I went during lunch several times and they will have you in and out within 30 mins.  Highly recommended for a business lunch or a family dinner.",

I was so impressed with the service and the delicious food that I drug a friend visiting from San Francisco there for dinner.  He was impressed with the curried duck dish he ordered, and that they had his favorite imported beer.  He claims that Swaddee is far better than any Thai restaurant he has found in SF.  The prices are reasonable, the food and service is great, and the atmosphere is really nice.   Recommended:  Beef or chicken Prig Khing curry, pork fried rice, red curry duck, and a \"Thai Iced Tea\".",

We have never actually dined in but it is always a very pleasant wait in the dining room when I arrive early for my take-out.  I am partial to the Pad Wo Sen (transparent noodles) with chicken. I always get a 3 on the spicy scale as I made the mistake of getting a 5 once, and I like spicy food.  The rest of my family gets a 1.  The staff is always cheerful and nice.",

I ordered Spicy Noodles spice level 4 it was pretty hot good flavor it came with a spring roll really good but the salad it came with was just ok. I will give this place another try really good lunch prices.",
