    "text": "My friends and I were in town for Spring Training and found this place on Yelp.  It was so good we came two days in a row!  The first day I had the secret bbq sammie and we shared the spinach fundido dip.  The bbq flavor on the sammie was delicious and I loved their mock chicken.  The fundido dip was literally the best spinach dip I've had since giving up dairy.  The second day I had to try the Big Wac and animal fries.  The burger was delicious and the fries were amazing.  We also enjoyed the selection of local beer.  After dinner, we shared some tsoynamis and then I fell into a food coma for the next 12 hours.  I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "in brief: Yum yum in my tum tum! their vegan dishes are enjoyable even for the carnivorsaurs. However, if you're not vegan, pass on the soy-based \"ice creams\"  I ordered:   1. Mac and Cheese with Veggie ($7.50):  Delish! It was warm cheesy and gooey and just all the positive adjectives you would want to associate with a mac and cheese. I could tell from taste that it wasn't normal cheese, but it was still delicious none the less! It's a cheddar based cheese sauce with elbow macaroni, with broccoli, zucchini and carrots. The taste was spot-on as a vegan mac and cheese, although the macaroni were a little softer than I'd like; definitely not al dente. I'm thinking its because vegan pasta noodles cooks differently than regular pasta noodles, so it's not fair for me to complain :)   2. Banana Cream Pie-- one of their Soy, vegan \"ice creams.\"  (~$5 for 16 oz) This flavor i had ordered was their special, it was banana cream pie. It was good enough to cool you down on a hot day, but it was meh tasting. The base tastes like soy milk with thickener, and it was mixed with added banana slices and then topped with a blahhh tasting whip-toping. :(  Although it wasn't too sweet, and I appreciated that; but I'd much rather have a pint of hagen daaz of coffee ice-cream for half the price at a supermarket than to get this.  I would definitely come back to try their other items! I had a piece of their mock chicken and mock-bbq meat, both as were delicious in salads!  Recommendation: try one of their bowls! There are many exciting ones to try on the menu!",

    "text": "My last couple experiences at this location of Green have not been so great.  On my most recent visit, my friend and I both ordered Drunken Mushroom bowls with chicken.  My daughter ordered something off their new kids' menu.  When our bowls arrived, neither one of them had any mushrooms!  What the...?!  Also, my daughter's food came way after ours arrived.      When a manager came out because our bowls were made incorrectly, he did not apologize.  He just said he didn't know how it happened and he'd make sure they were made right.  We waited an awfully long time for the mushrooms to be added to the bowls.  And, while I did not expect anything as a comp for our inconvenience, we did not get anything comped.  We also asked if they had any bowls that were not made with sugar in the sauce due to my friend being a diabetic.  They told us they had NO sauces or marinades that did not contain sugar.  Wow.  I knew Green was like fast food for Vegans, but there should be SOMETHING without added sugar.  Perhaps a simple soy and garlic marinade?  Since they had to remake our bowls anyway, my friend just got vegetables without any sauce added.    While I still do love the Green New American Vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix, this location just does not have the customer service or the attention to detail that the other location has.    Sadly, I don't make it to this part of town enough to warrant a return visit after this last visit.",

The no harm chicken parm was excellent, with perfectly crisp breaded seasoning, flavorful tomato sauce, vegan cheese that was a very close texture to mozzarella, on a soft fresh bun.  I also tried some of the buffalo wings, which were tangy, spicy, with a nice texture similar to chicken.  I was surprised to discover that the wings are actually made from mushroom, but that explains why it was so good (I love mushrooms).  While I'm not exactly a vegetarian, I have friends that are vegetarian and vegan, and I do appreciate good food when I taste it, and will definitely go here again to try more dishes.  P.S.  Their vegan ice cream is amazing!  The coffee ice cream with coco puffs is heavenly.",

The girls working there that took our order were super polite and helpful.  They offer lots of different varieties - YAY!! (It's hard to come across good vegan places with variety like this, so that itself is refreshing!) Anyway, I ordered the Diablo Red bowl with tofu which was absolutely delicious and SO much food! They also serve local craft beer (Four Peaks), which is always a plus in my book! I'd say the prices were pretty normal for a place like this.. Expect to pay $7 - $10 per plate.  I definitely recommend this place and will be going back!",

The Big Wack tasted just like a Big Mac...and the thyme fries were thin and crispy and perfect!  The tahini coleslaw was also very good.  The Calexico burger was good, but not as good as the Big Wack.  We also had the artichoke gratin.  Good, but probably wouldn't order it again.  We had lunch there again the following day because there were other menu items we wanted to try, and were we're so full from our burgers the previous day that we didn't have room for a soynami.  This time we tried the Singapore orange bowl with house tofu and brown rice, and the Kung pow with house tofu and noodles.  Both were really good, but the Singapore orange was better, as was he rice.  Lots of veggies and tofu cooked perfectly.  We even had room to share a soynami made with homemade vegan kit kats and chocolate syrup.  It was really good...although the kit kat could have been chopped smaller.  All in all, really yummy.  Not health food by any means....and quite salty, but yummy still.",

I had the \"mock chi-Ken parmesian sandwhich\" it tasted *exactly* like mozzarella sticks (or, at least, what I remember them tasting like from years ago....) which I happend to LOVE.....That sandwhich was sooooooo good, even the bread was perfect! I can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu....  Their tsoynamis are good too (tho, not as well made as the Nami location in Phoenix....my friend complained she only had one banana slice in her clunky monkey, where as at the other location it was FULL of banana) I had the Chai tirramasu (or something like that) it was DELISH! I think that is my new fave flavor (or it's a tie between that and clunky monkey)   So happy this is nearby, and that I don't have to drive all the way to phx to get my nami and green fix :)",

    "text": "This place is so ridiculously overrated. It's the only time Yelp reviews for a restaurant have misguided me.  The problem isn't that the food is bad (it's decent)... it's that the food is comically expensive for what it is. My wife and I paid $50 for our meal, which consisted of two basic stir fry's, a tiny portion of vegan chicken wings, and two bottled teas... from a restaurant where you order at a counter and find your own seat. If it was literally half the price this would be a 3-4 star review.   I actually got buyers remorse from this restaurant.",

    "text": "I was hungry and decided to try out the Green in Tempe because my experience at the one in Phoenix was a long time ago, but very good from the memories I recalled.   We drove and found parking (slightly tight, because this place is busy and there are spots but not too many of them lying around) and proceeded to head in.  It was about 2:30PM at this point, so I assumed it would be settled down after a lunch rush. No such thing. This place was full, busy, and still churning out food like it never had been slow to begin with. That is a great start in my books.  We (I dragged my fella in tow for this stop) headed up to the counter and grabbed a menu and looked through what to get. When the line moved up and it was our turn we ordered, paid, and took a number to place on a table of our choosing. The staff was pleasant, although fairly quiet, but they moved us along politely and we waited.  While waiting for the food, we bought beverages which you can either grab from their fridge, or choose from 4 refillable drinks. We choose the refillable drinks and chugged away.  Green Tea (strong, deep flavor), Lemonade (mild lemon taste, not a ton of sugar), Limeade with Ginger (lime was a good taste, could not taste ginger), and I believe it is called Virmto (a medium weight beverage tasting like cherries, weirdly addicting, you should have a taste)  They bring our food and it was filling and just enough for lunch.  Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" ($5.00) For those that don't like spice this was not too bad. It had more components of vinegar to the spice than actual heat. The \"wings\" were great soy chicken substitutes and I did not miss actual chicken in this. If the tartness of these is too much then go ahead and dunk them in the Vegan Cucumber Ranch that comes with it. It was some yummy ranch!  Artichoke Chicken Salad ($6.00/$9/00) We ended up getting the small salad and that was plenty for him and I to split. There was a Lemon-Tahini dressing that brightened up the greens very well, the salad leaves were dark & crisp, big pieces of artichoke strewn throughout the salad, and again the soy chicken was fantastic. You can tell it is fake with further inspection, regardless it still tastes fantastic (this was also prepared differently than the wings, it was a longer flat pieces where the wings were more like clusters of soy chicken).    Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($8.50) The chicken is prepared the same way in this sandwich as it was in the salad. The BBQ sauce had a tiny (I mean tiny) kick to it and was slightly messy to eat. Prepare for a burger stance with this one (elbows kicked out, looming over the sandwich aggressively). The Tahini Cole-Slaw was good, but had a lot of tahini and peanuts which overpowered the cabbage for me. The downside to the sandwich was the bun. The bun was a plain burger bun that was slightly stale and not that flavorable. The dryness of the bun against the sticky bbq sauce made a consistency that liked to get stuck in my mouth. Not the classiest thing to fix in front of other people, mind you.  With eating this food there were people that continued to come and go from the building non stop. The atmosphere is a bit hipster (staff was polite, but other guests really liked themselves and it was obvious) though I saw many suits, parents, and bros hanging out. Good melting pot!  Overall I think this place had great food, cheap prices, manageable crowds, and I could go back easily to try more items. Stay tuned, I need to go get a Tsoynami.  Cheers,  Messy Papers.",

Sometimes I crave a good steak, some yummy roasted chicken or a slice of delicious roast pork but Green has changed my food wants, recently I've been craving the delicious goodness of Green's awesome food.   From first bite of the drunken mushroom chicken Green won me over. I do love mushrooms but the mock chicken totally fooled my carnivore mind. I love the flavors in the dish and how it was made together. Since my first time last Thursday 3/28 I have been in love with this place. I've had their samosas which are good, the Singapore Tofu noodle, yum yum! the vegan chili fries, outstanding (although next time I'm getting the chili on the side to avoid sogginess)! yes, thyme fries are my new loves. lol. the buffalo spicy \"wings\" are on point. BuT the one thing that makes Green extra awesome are their... Tsoynamis!!! These vegan treats, wait are they vegan? hmm still are worth my cheat days!! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY! The PB&J is so freaking good, love the peanut butter especially, the butterfinger is just addicting and the banana cream pie is my new crush!   Green thank you for being around and thank you for your awesome bites. love you. Oh and they have Vitmo... yea that's a star for just being kick-ass!! =)",

The employees are welcoming and always deliver your food within 10 minutes of ordering.   I recommend the Singapore Orange bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. It's delicious! Treat yourself to an almond milkshake for dessert.   You'll leave full and happy :)",

The food here was delicious, I'd eat here regularly if I lived in Phoenix! When we arrived, we were worried about the hours since we got there pretty close to closing time, but they were cool! We shared the samosas and buffalo wings for appetizers. I ordered the Thai Peanut bowl with mock chicken and noodles for my entree. I felt like everything was flavored well and while I enjoy meat normally, this opened my mind to trying other vegetarian places in the future. I liked the ambiance here, great place to grab a bite with friends and chill. It was the perfect place to stop by after a busy weekend! I'll be back next time I'm in the area.",

I was shocked when I asked if there were tree nuts (allergic-not deadly just painful) in anything I wanted to order, it took a while for them to find out & didn't sound sure or convincing (playing with fire). Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and it's nice for transitioning into veganism or satiating cravings if you need to.",

My girlfriend and I split a Jerk Tofu Salad and the BBQ Chicken Sandwich with fries. The salad was fantastic, the dressing was delicious and just enough was on the salad to spice it up without making it a total over drenched mess. The tofu in it was spicy and delicious and the texture was amazing. We've tried preparing it a number of ways at home but this was a new level of deliciousness. Now the sandwich, the \"chicken\" was pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing. If I didn't know any better I would have said it was in fact real chicken. The bbq sauce on the sandwich was sweet and tangy but not overpowering and the veggies were grilled perfectly along with the chicken. The fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly, again, not over done like some places ultra salty fries. We were both stuffed and happy for just about 20 bucks total. This place is a total win and I wish I had checked it out earlier but I'll be coming back soon for sure.",

The bff is as close to a fried chicken sandwich as you can get and the big wac will make you question if it is vegetarian. So in love with this place!

We asked 2 employees, and one said that they measure them (8 oz limit... in a 12 oz cup! No wonder they look so small!) But EVERY time we visit the 7th St location they are served WAY above the top of the cup. It makes for a much better presentation, and a happier customer! The 2nd person we asked said that she works at both locations, and that she agrees that they are inconsistent and that bigger is definitely her choice to serve customers. We definitely go to the 7th St location whenever possible. I'm only giving 3 stars because i think for the price, and for customer satisfaction, you ought to mimic your other location. PS the 2nd employee made sure they filled our cups!  PPS i see in your photos that 3 yrs ago, you used to make them over the top like they are in phx. Putting 8 oz in a 12 oz cup is SO tacky!

    "text": "I recently discovered Green New Vegetarian restaurant when my diet needs changed. I was looking for something tasty yet vegan. I know, sounds like an oxymoron. I really did find some great things at Green. The business is in a nondescript retail Plaza on the west side of Scottsdale Road, to the south of the Salvation Army store. There is a small outdoor patio, which is nice. The inside is very clean and open, and lends to the trendy side. I especially appreciate the ice machine comma which is correctly labeled with a million small pictures of Ice Cube. There are some great selections on this menu. Let me interject by saying they also have a good selection of beer, wine and other drinks. On my first visit, I tried the classic veggie burger. It was really great. The burger was tasty and had a nice size. The thyme fries, while a little bit on the soggy side, were very tasty as well. On my second visit, I tried the buffalo chicken po-boy. I wasn't as big a fan of this sandwich. It was a very large portion comma and the buffalo sauce had a nice flavor. I think I was just not a fan of the mock chicken texture itself. Again, I had the thyme fries, and they were the same as before. On my most recent visit, I had the Thai peanut Rice Bowl. There was not a whole lot of rice, but just enough to accent the amazing amount of vegetables and perfectly marinated tofu. The sauce was a bit runny, but had a nice flavor. On this visit, a friend and I also ventured into the world of tsoynami. These cups of heaven come in many different flavors and are absolutely delicious non-dairy ice cream treats. We tried the s'mores flavor and also the cookie dough flavor. I could eat the cookie dough all by itself. As a matter of fact, they do sell the cookie dough comma which is also hilariously named DOH!. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Green. Although, I did go in uniform a few times, and I don't think the guy there is too fond of me. Give this place a try!",

It was done within 5 minutes, which I am happy about, however I was not happy with the taste. The sandwich was smothered in sauce, and was overwhelming my mouth with flavor to the point where I had to wipe off excess sauce. The patty was limp and tiny and although it was vegan, it could never compare to a real chicken patty. Overall, I was completely dissatisfied with my overly priced sandwich. The only good thing about this place was quick service and clean bathrooms.",

The best part is that they have some amazing soft serve ice creams and milkshakes. I notice that many visitors come here just for the desserts.  My only recommendation - I wish they had smaller sizes for their sundaes and desserts, I never order them because they are so big for one person :( However, that's probably a good thing if you are only looking to get their desserts ;)",

Bruh, let me tell you about the \"icecream\" this shit is fucking fabulous. So, I'm assuming this slice of heaven is aome sort of soymilk frozen yumminess. Not too sure and I don't really care. If it was frozen gasoline I'd eat that. Fuck yeah. Anyway, my favorite right; is called a fucking Fluffernutter. Keep your jiz jokes to youtube kiddos. This is delish. They take that weird soyicenotcream deal, mix that shit with some ricemellow. Which is fucking glorious. You with me still? So ricemellow... Then peanut butter. I love peanut butter. Also, youtube commenters go back to your shadows. Then you add some bananas. Bruh. Bananas, ricemellow and peanut butter. This shit tastes like moonpies. Not sure if y'all remember them, but dude. Amazing. I personally like to order twice that ricefluff shiznat and then add in some chocolate saaauce. Orgy in yourmotherfuckingmouth.   There ya go yelp. Since my original post was too short; have my real opinion.",

    "text": "I am absolutely in love with this place. I started going a few years ago and have probably eaten everything on the menu with the exclusion of some salads. The decor is interesting, lots of different artists have their work displayed on the walls and it changes around every month. Green can get very busy, especially during the dinner hours, and you might have to wait for 15-20 minutes in line. The cashiers are friendly and your food is usually brought out surprisingly fast.   Decor and service aside, the food is amazing! Buns can sometimes get soggy(secret bbq sammie) and some things are very salty(the chili), but at the end of the day it's delicious and comforting food. Their Big Wac is better than Mcdonald's, and I wouldn't want mock chicken from anywhere else. Seriously, the mock chicken is like a tender crunchy giant chicken tender. Their fries are thin cut and crispy and I love pairing it with the BFF, a spicy and savory chicken sandwich. They are generous with the portions here, and I often over eat because the food is so delicious. Any of their sandwiches are a safe bet to order and what I would recommend the most. The animal fries are tasty, but I think there should be more toppings for how many fries come with it. The wings are good, as are the samosas, but for the price of both I think there are better valued things on the menu. Good vegan crab puffs are hard to find, but Green definitely delivers delicious crab puffs. Thee fighting artichoke and peanut chicken are yummy salad options, and I would also recommend the Thai peanut rice bowl. You might think after all that food I'd be stuffed, but every time I MUST order a Tsoynami. It is the end all be all for vegan ice cream. The vegan answer to a blizzard is definitely satisfying: a creamy sweet ice cream swirled with whatever toppings you choose, from vegan butterfingers (Betterfinger) to delicious granola and peaches (Lifes a peach). I highly recommend their ice cream tsoynamis. Between those and the Big Wac, anyone would be sure to leave satisfied.   I gave Green five stars, because while there are a few menu items I won't order, it is the best place I've found for vegan comfort food, and maybe even omnivorous comfort food as well. Really really tasty food has earned my 5 star rating.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice. I appreciate somewhere where I can go and get a meal with some green vegetables that are more than just the garnish and also have some vegan options. My first meal I got a rice bowl and I enjoyed that although it was a little spicy or than I had expected. I realize the description said spicy garlic but I assume the spicy meant the garlic and not the red chili pepper that was also in there. I kept reading about the thyme fries so and my second visit I decided to take the leap and order the fries which is rare for me. I also ordered the peanut bowl gluten free option. The fries were a huge disappointment. I ordered them as a treat, I eat fries once or twice a year. I have no idea what is so special about these fries. There was never a hint of thyme flavor and it's certainly wasn't visually observable. They were just regular fries, nothing special at all, a little greasy and their ketchup tasted weird. The peanut bowl was okay. I'm pretty sure they're fake chicken is deep fried. In my opinion its a wash as far as vegan chicken that's fried vs regular chicken breast as long as its raised properly. If I return to the area in the future I might stop in but I think there's very little on the menu for me and if you want to stick with healthier food you need to order carefully here. The food arrived super fast, a little too fast as I like to wash my hands before I eat. I had no sooner ordered and gotten some water and the fries were on the table. The cashier was friendly and helpful when I was ordering.",

I never knew vegan food could taste so good; Or to be made like *meat*... and taste good! Both husband and son had the Big Whack - similar to McDonald's Big Mac. Fries - same. I had a mock chicken rice bowl with veggies. My mother had a mock beef rice bowl with veggies. I forgot the names of the menu items, but they were absolutely yummy!  Fast forward to 1 week ago, my son graduated from college and we had his graduation party catered from Green and again, they did not disappoint. Delivery was a little early (great!) We had a taco bar (with all the fixins) and mini beef sliders. Chef Damon is a magician. Not sure how he does it, but all the omnivores at the party were impressed and fully satisfied. Chicken tacos were the bomb! Thank you Chef Damon! Party was a success!",

We now live near Apache Junction so it is quite the drive to make it to either Tempe or Phoenix Green.  I do want to give feedback on the new menu. There have been some recent changes and I have to say I am so happy with them. Before, you were able to get a side, like fries or cole slaw with a burger. This is fine, but sometimes we didnt want those sides. Sides are now ala carte and I love this option! Before we would only get wings, our two sandwiches with the fries. NOW we are able to get wings, another side, and our sadnwiches. I like that there are more options now. I am also incredibly happy with the new patty change. I always liked wendy's pickle but I opted for otherwise because of the \"chicken tender\" type patty. The new one is way better, easier to eat, and all around tasty.  I would love to see the Raspberry Beret permanently on the menu. We love it.   Keep doing your thing, Damon!",

Because so many people in reviews raved about the hot wings we decided we had to give them a try.  We neither one could eat them, they were hard and dry with very little taste to them.  We also tried the eggless rolls which were ok however very greasy.  We were surprised to have the BBQ bacon burger that we shared come out with a white bun instead of whole wheat.  I don't understand why the Chef/Owner quit with the healthy aspect of a vegetarian/vegan menu and put in a processed white flour bun!  I realize there are vegans who do eat gluten products, however there are those of us who prefer to eat gluten free.  I have never written a bad reveiw of a restaurant before so I feel very bad about this, but I felt I needed to.",

I was expecting spicy Indian chutney type of samosas but instead, these were more sweet (picture apple turnovers) Middle Eastern type of somosas.  Not bad but not what I was hoping for.  The portions are large for the price and I left feeling very full.  I would definitely go back again and get the hummus and maybe try one of their curry bowls which looked really good.

    "text": "Not going to lie, I hate this place.  There are two Green's in Phoenix: this one in Tempe, and one in midtown Phoenix. And the difference between the two is night and day.  Part of what makes or breaks an eating \"experience\" to me are the surroundings I find myself in. When I am surrounded by Scottsdale Reich Mommies serving their kids \"healthy\" deep fried tofu and praising its healthful benefits, my stomach begins to turn. When I am out numbered 3 to 1 by hipsters sporting the standard hipster uniform, and stench, in 110* heat, my fists begin to clench. When I wander about to the bathroom and every square inch of the open space is some sort of high minded yet unfounded preaching about the evils of meat, my blood begins to boil. When the parking lot is filled with grubby little rich skater punk kids from Scottsdale trying to be scenesters, I just see red and either have to leave or face assault charges. Fat little wannabe future rabble rousers sitting in the corner yelling so loudly at each other that you can tell that mom and dad never put their hand up side little baby precious's head is where my cool came undone. I had to leave.  And best of all, the True cherry on the shit sundae, was the \"vegan ouija board.\" That's just insulting to the point where I wanted to take it down, and then just wait for the first person to come up to give me shit so I could wrap the frame around their head.  I'm not about to catch a charge to eat at this bullshit festival.  But onto the food.  - Greasy - Unhealthy - cold - For some reason they removed the soda fountain, and yet they have all the bottled drinks there with just as much sugar as, if not more than, a coke. Sounds like this was done for profits, not health.  So why would I bother going here? I do this to indulge my girlfriend and her vegetarian family. But I don't think I can do it again after tonight.  I understand the benefits of the lifestyle, but when your \"lifestyle\" makes you look like nothing more than a bunch of over indulged white kids suffering from \"the white man's burden\" you need to reevaluate your whole thing.  The New Green over in Phoenix, on the other hand, does not cause the ire that this place does. From now on I will do all I can to deprive the Tempe Green of my money, and the money of anyone I associate with. Gotta vote with your dollar dollar bill y'all.",

    "text": "Amazing food. That simple. This from a non-vegan, non-vegetarian.    I was looking around at local restaurants and stumbled upon reviews for this place. I was shocked to find it was located so close to me, and figured I had to try it, that day. So I did; straight after work I stopped by.    From talking with a coworker, the decor inside apparently changes; when I went in I found it really pleasant. A little bit dimmer than I would have liked, but with strings of white Christmas lights strung up alongside the ceiling lights.     I did not eat in, but looking around, I think I'd feel comfortable doing so, everything looked clean and comfortable, very laidback, slight alternative vibe, but not to where I'd feel uncomfortable if I felt that wasn't me (it's not).    I ordered the thai peanut bowl with mock chicken, and the eggless rolls. The wait was on the order of 5, 10 minutes, nothing bad at all. As I waited, I noticed the bottled drinks...they have Cricket cola. Yes. Next time, I'm taking one home with me. I've been jonesing for Cricket cola for a while now.    Taking the food home I tucked in almost immediately. The thai peanut bowl was very good; filling and tasty. The mock chicken was clearly not chicken, but I didn't mind, it still was good. If you want something a little different, or are avoiding meat, yeah, this is as good as you're gonna get.    The eggless rolls though...to. die. for. They had a note of sweetness to them that moved them from being 'vegan knockoffs' to something wholly unique and delicious. I could see myself purposefully choosing these on their own merits, rather than as a vegan alternative to a real eggroll. I did not expect that from vegan food.    If you're vegan, vegetarian, or just want to try something different, this is definitely an excellent choice.",

Problems are in the service, since the start of summer 2011 it has gone way downhill. Today I waited for 35 min for my food, had other people who ordered after me served, then when they finally noticed me, they came over and told me to come up and ask if my food is taking too long. Isn't that their job to serve in a timely manner? Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served?  On top of it, they screwed up my order, I had to go back in and get it fixed (more waiting time). Being late, being stupid, and being wrong? Three strikes in one visit - this place is done.   I won't be going back.",

Our cousin recommended it to us, and while neither myself nor my sister are vegan or vegetarian, we absolutely loved Green. The people that took our order and brought us the food were super friendly and genuine and the whole vibe of the place was pretty cool. There's art all over the restaurant, the other patrons were a nice enough mix of hipsters, families, and professionals, and if I recall correctly some good tunes were being played on the stereo.   Being on a bit of a budget, we each just got one thing and water to drink. I had the OG Buffalo \"Chicken\" Po-Boy with some fries and it was delicious! Like I said, I'm a meat-eater but was not left discontent; their mock chicken was just as good as the real thing with lots of flavor and everything else on the sandwich was fresh and tasty. My sister got the Thai peanut noodle bowl with crispy tofu and it was also well done, with fresh veggies, and a nice peanutty sauce that was a tad sweet, with some vinegar zip to balance.   Next time I'm in Tempe I will surely come back to Greens, and I recommend it to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!",

My favorite dish would have to be the lemon pesto bowl with fried tofu. The first probably 10 times I came here I got that and nothing else. Other items I've really liked: BBQ bacon burger, Wendy's pickle, poor boy mock chicken sandwich. Salad with chicken. Chicken wings for appetizer are also great. Fries are very good. Milk shakes are great  Only two items I've had which didn't think were excellent were the shrimp appetizer and the big wac, and a curry dish (I eat a lot of Thia food though so hard to beat thai curry) I just wish one of the locations was open on a Sunday, and also the price can add up. Me and my gf came and two dishes a couple appetizers and drinks came to over $60. The food is quality and not greatly over priced or anything, would feel better about it if everything was organic. But those are small issues and overall it is definitely the best vegan location I've been to.",

    "text": "OK SO HERES THE DEAL.   I used to love this place. I took family here, mom , grandmas, brother, cousins, the whole shabang . I brought dates here, I brought friends here, I had meetings here, my friends were the ones that brought me here in the first place and I fell in love.   Well honey, that was a year ago, or maybe a few months ago, BUT NOW that has all changed because they CHANGED THEIR MENU.  and its awful.  Long story short, Im a phx native, but I go to school out of state and I had always craved green when I was gone because I wanted GOOD vegan food, that the boca burger and salad crap. So after 14 weeks away I decide to order one of my two favorites and really the only two things i order other than a soynami or wings; the orcettee bowl with no harm chicken parm or the sweet and sour. SO I call to order to go and find out that both of these are NOT on the menu anymore and that they changed their menu literally days after I went back to school. SO , I CANCELED THE ENTIRE ORDER AND WENT SOME WHERE ELSE THAT DOESNT CHANGE THEIR MENU AND TAKE THE BEST THINGS OFF. aka pita jungle.  Literally I am so devastated that i decided to look up other responses to find that I wasn't the only one complaining and that they had changed other things on the menu as well as taken favorites off. They changed their delicious burgers to disgusting boca burgers, and added a bunch of salads.   SERIOUSLY. YOU ADDED BOCA BURGERS AND SALADS? AND TOOK OFF SOME OF THE BEST VEGAN FOOD IN THE WORLD? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I wont eat a boca burger if it was the last thing on earth. Im so sick of going to bbqs and being asked if i want a boca burger. NEXT thing is adding salads? REALLY? did you ever think that salads are really the only thing that vegans can eat at normal restaurants? and you decide to take the good food that vegans cant get anywhere else and replace it with the only thing we can eat.  WOW. THANKS FOR GOING FOR THE STEROTYPE  . VEGETARIAN = ONLY EATS SALADS? REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GOIGN TO TAKE AWAY NEXT? THE WINGS? THE SOYNAMI? im getting out of there waaaaay before that happens. like maybe now. THANKS GREEN.  you hurt my feelings. :(  I honestly dont think i want to go back im so up set. In fact DONT GO. whats on the menu now is nothing compared to what it used to be.   THE POINT IS:  IF YOU HAD SOMETHING AMAZING WHY CHANGE IT?  if your going to add things to the menu dont take things away. the sweet and sour and the ocette pasta was literally the only thing i ever got there besides wings and a soynami and now what? you may call me stubborn but both of those were so good that all you ever wanted were those two items. If you have the ingredients why not put them back together to make something amazing?  so thanks green for making my homecoming suck because you changed your menu and made it horrible. MAYBE you should just Add on to the old menu and not completely wipe it off the face of the earth.",

Their mock chicken is pretty good, made from soy, which may take a little getting use to if you don't like mock foods. The Mongolian bowl is pretty good.

We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and it was pretty poppin'. They place smells really good, and if I hadn't already had dinner plans I probably would have tried something off of the menu.   The guy at the register was nice, and I decided on the almond joy-esque tsoynami, with soy ice cream, almonds, chocolate syrup, and coconut. Jon had the pb&j and added vegan cap'n crunch. While we were all consumers of meat and dairy, the tsoynami's were super good. You get about 16oz of goodness, and after licking the cup clean, you don't feel weighed down as you might after eating the same amount of Cold Stone. This is definitely someplace I'd come back to, and may even be daring enough to try lunch or dinner :)",

    "text": "Green's food is good enough to turn me vegan (just kidding i love meat)! But seriously, before ever trying Green, I thought \"how can this vegan crap possibly be any good?\". Eat here, you'll understand. The \"no-harm\" chicken parm is out of this world, as are the \"burgers\" and the buffalo chicken wings. I've never had a bad dish here, and the texture of the faux meats are strikingly similar to the real thing... if I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was!   Save room for dessert! The Tsoynamis are a vegan version of a DQ Blizzard, yet again somehow just as delicious, if not better!!!",

Had you never heard anything about this place before, from the view outside Green you would most likely drive right on by. Its also kind of hidden but that hasn't slowed down their business one little bit and here is why. THE FOOD IS KILLER. Seriously.  The staff was super friendly, they serve and offer vegetarian food as well as all natural beverages, organic, vegetarian and vegan shelf foods to take home. While there I had a kombucha tea to drink, my boyfriend had an all natural cola and we shared the chili fries and the apricot miso bowl with fresh tofu. The portions were great and we were super full after. We spent around $21 after both food items, drinks and tip. Not bad! Especially for fresh, vegetarian ingredients that fill you up.  A fun and delicious time. If you are visiting AZ, make a trip for sure.",

Was super tasty except I discovered I'm not a fan of mock cheese.  I love me some mock chicken, but apparently not mock mozzarella.  Had the thyme fries as my side and they were awesome, and I'm usually not a lover of shoestring fries.  Warning though, they were very garlicky so had to do double duty on the mints after wards since I was meeting clients.  Looking forward to going back to try the mushroom \"chicken\" drunken noodles!  Yum!",

I have tried mocked chicken earlier, but this place oustands the competitors I believe. Wild wings - this is a very small portion of chicken with some tangy red sauce. A side of sliced carrots and cucumber. I would just say the best. Obviously a beer goes well with the menu. I opted for a peach ale. I wouldn't comment as these guys won't brew them.  Ambience is good and a very quick service. I would rate this a 4.5. Could have earned a 5 if tables were clean and no water/food spills on the floor.",

Being able to eat other options, I think they are a bit pricey for the amount you get. They used to be bigger.

OKAY I take BACK what I said before! Now y'all got our love! Wish I had my camera because this deserved a BOMB ASS PHOTO! root beer floats I'm pretty sure you can't get at the other green/nami because this location has both in one restaurant and has less sweets..so this makes up for it! Haven't had one in YEARS! The Philly cheesesteak was TOO ON POINT for me words to describe! Probably best one I've EVER had! Your workers were fast, friendly, and polite! Plus they made this the best we've ever had at this location! The animal style sauce was a little off flavor wise, wasn't tasting how it normally does..but that DIDNT MATTER because these fries were 10000% better than the last ones we received! Very happy we decided to give this location another try! Next time I'll bring my camera to show off the results of your hard work that does not go unnoticed  THANK YOU A MILLION.

Just don't expect it to taste like chicken.  At the counter, definitely order one of the pastries (or two). I loved my peanut butter bar, which was essentially like a really creamy peanut buttery rice-crisp bar with chocolate on top. I also caved and got a soynami after my meal, but honestly, I'd skip it... I got one of their specials, the Almond Brothers (chocolate bark with almond + housemade caramel sauce + chocolate base). It definitely tasted like normal froyo, but a little too sweet and icy for me.",

Well right now I called and ordered ahead as usual, and when I got inside there was a long line, so I went ahead of the line like we usually do, and the cashier completely embarrassed me in front of everyone and yelled \"Who's next?! Oh wow, YOU are?! You're really going to cut ahead of all these people?!!\" I said \"I'm so sorry, the last cashier told me if it was takeout we could come straight up to pay, I'm sorry I'll go to the back I'm not trying to be rude.\" Where he proceeded to say very loudly \"no it's totally fine to cut everyone here, let me just ring you out!\"                         I was completely mortified and I can't believe he'd talk to any customer like that. If I were in line and someone called to take out I would totally understand, especially if they were doing what a Green Employee told them to do!!!!! It was so rude and I'm so embarrassed. I refer EVERYONE to Green but I'm never going back to that location again.",

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the wait. The line was literally going out of the door onto the patio and they only had one person taking orders. I waited at least 25 minutes just to get to the cash register. If you have extra time on your hands I would definitely check this neat, modern restaurant out!",

Luckily, the lady at the front was more than willing to talk about her favorites and their most popular items out of the different categories (bowl, sandwich, etc)  I decided on the bff which is a faux fried chicken sandwich with jalapenos, guacamole, tomatoes and cheddar on a toasted bun. I also got a side of the tahini coleslaw because I was intrigued on what their spin would be.  The sandwich was sizeable and delicious! I'm not vegetarian but the mock chicken tasted great and the outer layer was lightly crispy/fried to add some nice texture to the sandwich.  The tahini cole slaw wasn't like your average cole slaw. It had shredded green and purple cabbage, but also green onions and peanuts. I'm not sure what else it was tossed in besides tahini, but I loved it. It wasn't heavy or drenched in a creamy sauce like some cole slaws are but it was light, crunchy, and fresh.  The restaurant itself is located in a building strip that has a few empty businesses making it slightly hard to see from the main road but the inside was very nice and there's a patio with chairs and umbrellas you can sit out on.  After seeing some more yelp pictures/reviews of the place I wish I had tried a tsoynami but I guess I'll just have to come back again.",

Luckily I am almost done with every aspect of the God Forsaken Phoenix area (finally back to So Cal in 2018) but decided to give Green another shot for a quick lunch.  Being a workday I did not have 2 hours for lunch and thought I would be pretty safe ordering a damn burger and chili....   Wrong!!! It took 45 minutes to get my order due to the supposed reason that more Chili was being made. Well when I finally got my order the Chili was cold and the burger was so so.  In addition ( and this is where the arrogance comes in) the kid who brought my order forgot to bring a spoon for the Chili and when I went up to ask for one a pimply faced girl who was working the register gave me attitude.  Keep your attitude to your self and Greens staff should visit vegan restaurants in LA or the Bay Area to see how it's done.  On a side note last time I ordered at the Green midtown location it took an inordinate amount of time to get my order there as well..I should have remembered that before going in today",

The hummus is my fave. It's got  a bit of a spice which I love and comes with deep fried pita (sometimes a bit too greasy, but I can deal). The artichoke appetizer is delish, but not anything like a traditional, so I wouldn't expect that. The salads are really yummy, I can't remember which ones I've tried, so I can't specify which are best. And today, I tasted heaven in the form of a tater tot. They just introduced sweet potato puffs and they are incredible. I will be getting these as a side every time now! And then there's the tsoynami. Most incredible frozen treat ever. I get the betterfinger with no choco chips, add peanut butter and double chicostix (sp?) SOOOOOO good words can't describe.  I love it here so much that I make the trek from Ahwatukee to Scottsdale for lunch, salivating in anticipation, just to please my pallet a few times per month and it is worth every mile.   As mentioned in just about every review, the staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to make a recommendation if you ask. One time, when there was a mishap with my office's order that caused me to wait an extended period of time for pick up, I got a call upon returning to work from the manager with a personal apology. I can't recall another place EVER taking the time to do that. For this, I am forever loyal.  Reviewing this made me crave it all over again. I may have to go back for dinner. Don't judge me.",

    "text": "A Green-loving friend of mine finally got my to try this place out with her - I'm slowly becoming a fan!!  I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian, but I welcome new tastes with loving arms (er..mouth)...Anyways, I've been here a couple times now, and the \"mock\" food was pretty good!  The 1st visit, I tried the Lemon Pesto bowl with mock chicken, it was pretty good overall, but I wasn't really a fan of the weird, chewy mock chicken.  Luckily, there were only 3! pieces in it, so I was okay with that I guess.   The second time around, I tried the Coconut Curry bowl with the house tofu.  It was delicious!!  The house tofu is lightly fried and seasoned, so good I think most people would like it,  even if they weren't into \"health\" food.   Since I'm an ice cream lover, I had to try the Tsoynami, \"homemade vegan soy tSoft tServe, \" which then they stir in all sorts of goodies like cakes, cookies, chocolate, peanut butter and just about anything you can think of. I loved this copycat of a Blizzard!  I got the Dough Boy, which had vegan cookie dough in it and organic chocolate syrup.   I would definitely return here anytime my Green-loving friend wants to get her fix!!",

The lemon tahini dressing was perfect, creamy, sweet, tart, coating the lettuce perfectly. Then we tried the soy chicken....WOW. Jerk chicken spice, perfect texture, amazing! add it to the salad and it was our favorite part of dinner. Had two nice local IPAs to wash it all down while sitting on the patio under a star lit night. The BBBQ Bacon burger was made with seitan (which i've never had) and was delicious. The portobellos were a bit small, much like traditional white caps sliced thin on a burger and the caramelized onions were a bit too crisp but overall the texture of the burger really made it shine. My girlfriends thai peanut bowl was also very good, real peanuts in the bowl with steamed tofu. I think next time we'll change up the tofu for a sligthly less healthy flash fried tofu. Either way we're coming back here for date night.",

I really love this place, because they offer so many options, from pizza to noodles to salads.   First time I ate here, maybe a month ago, I got the Apricot Miso dish with mock chicken, and it was very good. Today I had the Spicy Peanut Sauce with Tofu appetizer and I had to restrain myself from licking the plate, the sauce is THAT good! The Coconut Curry with mock beef served over noodles was next, and honestly, it was just ok. I prefer the mock chicken texture/flavor. The curry was spicy but there wasn't enough of it in my dish - it was very dry.  But my favorite part of this place? The bathroom sink. It's totally cool, you just have to see it. Sorry, I didn't snap a photo in the bathroom for fear of being a total weirdo.",

Three redeeming values remain: the thyme fries are amazing, they remember your name and seem to have stepped up customer service and attention, and the Tsoynamis are delicious.

Most places we go to really do not bother even though if he eats the wrong food he can end up in the hospital We ordered the 'chicken' wings, 'crab' puffs, chili, kids' 'chicken' nuggets and, of course, their infamous Big Wac. We loved it all!!!! Another pleasant surprise was that they serve wine which was very decent for $5.50 a glass. We will definitely become regulars here and our other meat eating places are a thing of the past. Thank you , Green :)",

It came with a side of house cole slaw made with a hint of peanut butter to enhance the flavor. Both were VERY good.  Green doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is an entirely different story. All of the walls are covered with really cool recycled art i.e. old, painted VW hubcaps, menus cut up and made to look like birds flying through plastic grocery bag clouds, etc. You really just have to see it. The bottom line is, you get a strong vibe of responsibility for what you put into your body as well as the greater environment.

I had the Coconut Curry rice bowl which was pretty good and a bite of my friends \"Chicken\" Parm, which was also tasty. But I have to say, the Spicy Buffalo \"wings\" are what stole my heart!   I was a bit disappointed the menu was quite limited. I am allergic to nuts and there were a lot of dishes with nuts and I am also gluten-free, so I felt limited. I didn't eat a lot of comfort foods prior to becoming vegetarian like \"chili fries\" and \"burgers\" so I can understand some cynicism of Green gravitating toward these menu options.",

    "text": "I thought I had reviewed this place before since my friend owns it, but I guess I haven't. I'll admit that I'm a meatetarian, so this place isn't for me - but WAIT! It is for me... this place aims to make vegan food that tastes more like what \"normal\" people are used to since most \"normal\" people can't stomach most vegan cuisine.  I'm one of these people that can't stomach it. I prefer my meat and cheese and gluten and whatever else vegans cringe at. Not everyone is cut out to be a vegan. Some vegans I know of are kinda fat - they get this way because with the restrictive diet, they end up loading up on carbs eating nothing but chips and bread and candy and bean burritos and pasta. I'm not going to argue on how healthy or unhealthy this lifestyle is, but I'll say that the food at Green isn't diet food. It's rich and flavorful and a good. It's a perfect place to go if you're a couple and only one of you is vegan.  I dated a vegan once... I'm used to normally being the picky eater, but holy shit. We couldn't eat anywhere due to her \"diet\" restrictions and it was terribly annoying. Eventually, I got her eating burgers and steaks and real food again. Before that, of the few restaurants we were allowed to eat at - this was one of my favorites.   The menu is creative and there's something for everyone (unless you're allergic to veggies and tofu). I dare say my friend is a culinary genius and I suggest you all check out That's a Wrap (his other restaurant) as well.",

He was laughing at me (I've been a back and forth vegetarian/pescatarian for 5 years - always one or the other) as I went through the menu online going \"oooh!  oh my god....oooh!\"  It is a rare treat for me to find a place where I can eat EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu, without any modifications needing to be made.  We got carryout and it was certainly a bit of a drive from Central Phoenix (2nd location, please?  :)), but it was totally worth it.  I can't wait to try nearly everything on the menu.  Is it greasy?  Probably.  Is it health food?  No.  Is it awesome?  You bet.    P.S. I got the Mongolian Rice Noodle Bowl with Mock Chicken, and he got the Drunken Chicken w/Rice Noodles.",

So I have this job interview and the dude says, \"let's go to this Green restaurant,\" and I'm just dreading it so much.  Somehow I get talked into ordering the mock chicken, and then my world came to a screeching halt.  It's not \"like\" chicken, it's BETTER than chicken.  The texture is perfect, the taste is awesome, and it's not dried out like chicken is most of the time.  I had the Thai peanut bowl, and now I crave it, all day, every day.  But I'm this huge-ass outspoken carnivore with a reputation to protect, so now I'm living a double life.  I sneak there and tell people I went to a Brazillian steakhouse or a BBQ joint.    Hopefully someday I'll be able to come out about this...  (I LOVED the food here, but I really really wanted to knock my rating down one star because the guys working behind the counter yesterday were just the WORST.  Maybe they smelled the meat-eater on me, I don't know, but they were just rude and dismissive and totally inconvenienced to have to answer my TWO vegan-ignorant questions.  Sheesh guys, maybe you want to keep it a secret or discorage newbies or whatever, but please, just lighten up, ok???  Or maybe go out for a burger...)",

    "text": "Living in the Santa Cruz area, it's easy to  become accustomed to finding a variety of delicious vegetarian food. I traveled to the Phoenix area this spring for vacation and finding Green was like finding an oasis in the Arizona desert. My dining experience here was the best I had on the trip and I know if I lived in the area I'd be eating here at least once a week.   One of the things that impressed me so much was that Green makes all of their vegan mock meat and cheese goodies from scratch. The No-Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich stole the show, and was not made with your standard morningstar chik patty but rather a seitan-based lightly breaded from scratch recipe. The fake mozzarella cheese (which seemed more like ricotta) was creamy and delicious.   The vegan chili on the fries was tangy with just a little spice, and my boyfriend's Argenitine po-boy was a good take on fake steak.  The sides of tahini coleslaw and curry pasta salad were quite tasty as well. I only wish I'd had room to enjoy an oatmeal pie or a \"Tsoynami\" for dessert.   The service at Green was very friendly and it has a nice but casual artsy decor. I can't wait until my next trip to Phoenix!",

The tsoynami's are the real attraction for me.  Aside from the flavor combinations they suggest on the separate tsoynami menu, you can create your own concoction.  Good stuff!  Another one of my favorites in their cole slaw with tahini.  It has good flavor and a slightly crunchy texture.  It is very fresh.  Aside from the good food, the service staff is wonderful.  They are welcoming and helpful.  Most refreshingly, they are totally unpretentious.    For awhile I was eating at Green 2 times a week because it is so good.  But then the budget fairy intervened and reminded me I can't afford to do that ad infinitum, so I treat myself as often as I can to this hip, delicious culinary experience.",

    "text": "I should preface this review by stating that I am not a vegetarian. I am especially not vegan. I am a shameless meat and diary eater. But I am open to experimenting with different cuisines and always looking to try \"healthier\" foods. Green is a restaurant that I've driven by countless times and always tell myself that I should give it a try. I finally did last night, and I wasn't terribly disappointed. While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for, I appreciate the level of quality Green offers.   I decided to take an adventurous route and try the original \"g\" spicy po-boy. I consider this adventurous because the idea of mock chicken doesn't sit well with me. The real thing tastes better and the health differential is open to debate. The sandwich was decent but small. It's only a po-boy in spirit. If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy, you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of fish or meat. What saves this sandwich is the sauce. It's perfectly hot and the tofu absorbs all of its wonderful flavor. I like that Green uses mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. It may take away the crunchiness, but I like the taste much better. Green also goes light on the mayo, which I appreciate. The thyme fires are really good. They're thin and crispy, and the herb really enhances the flavor. They give you a lot of fries, which makes up for the sandwich being a little undersized, but I'd rather have more sandwich than fries.   Since heaven forbid I be strong enough to pass up on sweets, I also tried a peanut butter chocolate bar. Not bad. But certainly not worth its $3 asking price. It reminds me of a store-bought peanut butter rice crispy treat. I recommend only having this if you are a strict vegan.   The restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to look like. It's dark and artsy in a hipster bohemian style that you'd find in New York's West Village. It's semi-service. Order at the counter, wait at the table, and someone brings you your food. Green may want to look into assigning their customers a number, or a pager, to place on the table. Even though I was taking my order to go, I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names (way too fast food for me). They also may want to put their menus out near the front the place. They're all at the counter and there isn't a big menu board posted. How is someone new supposed to have a clue what's on your menu if they can't see it until they make it the place where you order?   A meat eater reviewing a vegetarian restaurant is like a vegan reviewing a steakhouse. I can appreciate the place for what it is, but it's just not designed for me. Green caters to a specific clientele that needs more restaurant options like this. I'm glad that there is a place like Green in the valley. It's everything that people who live this lifestyle can ask for. If you're a meat eater hoping for something that tastes just like \"normal\" food, you're obviously going to be disappointed. I'm certainly open to giving Green another try, and would even suggest it if I were planning on dining out with a vegan or vegetarian friend.",

He is a meat lover whereas I am a vegetarian so of course we can't agree on a place to eat, plus he is allergic to snooty \"organic\" places where an ok dish costs like a million dollars and everyone pretends to like it because it is \"the\" place to be.  After reading reviews on Yelp and looking at the menu, we decided to give Green a try. I was crossing my fingers because anyway vegetarians don't have much of a choice when eating out. We ordered wings, a BBQ chicken burger and a Mexicali burger. The first wing the husband ate made him a convert; I was already in love with the food and the options and the price. The burgers were great and the fries were DELICIOUS!  We've decided to make this place one we'll frequent. Love the ambience, the quick service and everything about it. Thank goodness for Green!",

Everything I've ever had here has been good. I loved it when I was a vegetarian and I love it now that I'm not. It was definitely hard to convince some meat eaters to come to a vegan place but once I got them there they all loved it. I don't know how this chef does it but all of the mock meat tastes so real its crazy. I think the Calexico burger is my favorite thing that I've tried thus far but the menu is pretty big so I still have a lot of ground to cover. The bowls and the po boys are the bomb too and so are the crab puffs. I've only tried one of the soynamis (I think it was a PB&J one) but it was soooo good. I always go with the intention of getting one but then I'm too full after eating my main meal that I just can't do it, rough life. I'll have to go back one of these 115 degree days and go solely for that reason. Also, I've seen some vegan jerky in there that I've wanted to try before. And they usually have a really good special of the day. One thing to note is don't expect that it's going to be some super crazy healthy vegan place. I would classify this more as vegan comfort food.

The place is never too packed and is super casual.  You walk up and the hardest choice is what to try.  Don't worry you can't go wrong.  Every time we have gone the cashiers have been very helpful if you are still deciding between two options.  For food, I would recommend the BBQ po boy.  It comes with a little kick.  The fries are always good and come with a great ketchup.  I am not a big fan of the thai slaw, so I would definitely go with the fries.  I have also had the pizzas and they are always safe.  The veggie burger is good, but if mushy burgers freak you out, then go another direction.  I do wish is a was a bit more firm.  If you are looking for a ridiculous treat, grab a Soynami on the way out.  My fave is the mint chocolate version.  One small thing that I do hate though is they serve them with wooden spoons and I am a bit weird and HATE eating off a wooden spoon.  Am I weird?  The soynami is so good, I still do it though.  Finally I am happy to have this place in town.  I am always amazed that Phx does not have more dedicated veg/vegan places for as big as it is.  If you are a fan of That's a Wrap, then you will be satisfied here - same ownership.    Another tip - Check out the t-shirts for sale.  I love my ninja deer on a bike shirt!",

So on my girls day out with my mother-in-law yesterday I decided to take her to this restaurant due to great reviews with yelpers.  I got tired of eating the same thing and it's hard to pick restaurants for vegetarian.  First of all the staffs are wonderful and so helpful.  Place was very clean even though it was very busy which is a good sign of great food.  I ordered BBBQ bacon burger with thyme fries and my mother-in-law ordered Singapore Orange with fried noodles.  We shared it all to taste since it's our first time there.  Oh my gosh the sandwich was so yummy with that awesome BBQ sauce.  And fries...best fries other then my mom's of course. Even my mother-in-law who's not a fan of fries couldn't stop eating this fries!  She loved this place so much that she's going to bring her husband here.  I was shocked that they never came here since they lived in Chandler for at least 20 years.  Oh and the Singapore Orange was delicious with mock chicken that I could eat all day.  Only thing was my mother-in-law wished there was more noodles so next time we'll order extra fried noodles on the side for her.  We also had tsoynamics recommended by one of the staffs there.  My mother-in-law likes ice cream but doesn't do well with dairy due to her IBS, so when she heard no dairy is in tsoynamics we ordered one and nice staff split one for us.  It was delicious even for me who is ice cream snob.  I LOVE ice cream and this was delicious with very clean after taste.   Yes I will be coming back to try other fabulous items with my meat loving husband.  He's going to be shocked!!!",

She had been here once before with less than desirable food, but figured she'd give it one more shot.  Well, no more shots for Green are in our future...  We ordered at the desk and our food came out within 15 minutes. No big deal there. My friend ordered the artichoke dip that was served with chips and hummus that was served  with deep fried pita chips, and I ordered the Kung Pao \"Chicken\".   If you didn't tell me there was artichokes in the dip, I would have never known. It was more of an enchilada sauce/bean dip weird mess. Not horrible on the pallet, but def not what we expected was ordered. The Hummus was spicy and came with a pickle (??) on the side. Pita crisps were way too deep fried for their own good. Needless to say... we did not ask for a to-go box.   The Kung Pao chicken wasn't bad per-say, but my \"Chicken\" was very stringy and foamy to the texture. Yes, I said I wasn't a veggie head, but I have had Morning Star \"chicken\" before and it's 10 times better than what  came in my bowl.  I get veggie heads love this spot because they don't have to narrow down the menu to 2 items, but me thinks not.",

    "text": "Much built up anticipation over this place... it's located far from my house and I don't have many veg friends, so I knew it would be awhile before I could try it out. But as a life long veggo I was super excited that there was a comfort food all vegetarian restaurant in the valley, that wasn't too strange. Finally!  It was different than what I expected inside... much more casual I guess. Counter service and fending for yourself over finding a table. I thought the decor was pretty unique and cool though.  I liked the selection of teas and lemonades. The green tea was yummy.  For starters we had the artichoke dip and crab puffs. Both were delicious but we were a little disappointed with the serving size of the crab puffs. 4 little pieces...  3 of us had the Po-Boy sandwiches. I had already tried a piece of the buffalo chicken at Devoured so I knew I would like the sandwich. They did not disappoint! All the components of the sandwich were good. The bread tasted bakery fresh and even the vegan mayo was good! It tasted just like real mayo. The shoestrings were hot and crispy, like upgrades fast food fries. My husband had the no harm chicken parm, which he thought was good but not great. He didn't like the texture of the cheese.  Kinda wish they had a liquor license... a glass of  wine or a brewsky would definitely enhance the meal. It seems like a lot of vegetarian eateries don't serve alcohol. What a shame.  We will definitely be back. There are so many other dishes I want to try!",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that i am not a vegan, but would LOVE to be; hence, i have a really strong appreciation for all you veggie lovers out there and i try to eat like you as much as I can - but i do consume meat....so maybe my body just wasn't used to all this soy protein and that's why i had really bad indigestion after visiting Green.   Also, both of my friends didn't feel well after eating at Green either. All of us just felt so bloated and unwell after our meal. Is it normal for a carnivore to feel this way?   My husband got the Mexi-Cali burger. The \"meat\" didn't hold together and seemed like mush....which means the texture wasn't appetizing. The vegan cheese on that thing was NOT good.   I got the steak po-boy. It was really more like a philly cheesesteak without the cheese.   Our friend got the peanut curry noodles. He liked the first few bites.  We really, really, really wanted to like Green esp after all these rave reviews and for the veggie lover, i'm sure this place is heaven! But for us semi-carnivores, it just didn't sit well. I'm sorry, i wish my review could be better!",

The dry sodas they sell and their homemade lemon and limeades are amazing. One of my favorite reasons to come there.

So glad they have another location in central phoenix.  I often go for the Big Wac (its like a vegetarian version of the Big Mac). Probably similar in calories too but it's meat free! The curry dish is also good. I love that they serve fruit as a side option. Overall, you can't go wrong with most of the stuff on the menu. I prefer the mock beef over the mock chicken, I've found its a bit more tender. Still, 5 stars from me! My only wish is that they were open a bit later!",

If I would have gotten this sandwich anywhere else, I wouldn't be able to tell if it was vegan. It's that good.  Oh, and get the fries.  The Fries are amazing.  Always perfectly cooked and crispy!  If you are thinking about getting Soy-nami, do it.  You won't regret it.  I got the Snuckers, and It tasted just like a snickers blizzard, probably better.   The cookies are also really really good.  I think we always end up getting at least one oatmeal cookie every time we go.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Even if you eat meat.

It's too expensive for the hype that it gets.   The parking is awful. I wish they were open for sunday breakfast. That I would actually go back for!

    "text": "I've eaten at Green a couple times, and I don't think I will ever go back there with the intention of eating a meal. I might consider one of their rice dishes, but nothing else. The sandwiches are  extremely greasy. I've had the original \"g\" spicy po-boy, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich with some faux meat. It just tasted like grease and buffalo sauce. I got the chicago cheesesteak on another occasion to try out their seitan, and it was just a greasy mess too...greasier than the real thing. I've also had the chicken nuggs and the texture leaves a lot to be desired and is quite flavourless. I think I need to try something without the faux meats and stick to tofu or just veggies to get a good meal there. I'll probably give them one more chance for lunch by getting a rice bowl and maybe update my review at that time if it improves my impression of their food.   I have come here for tsoynamis, and they aren't that consistent with making them. I usually get more than one, and one usually has noticeably more dessert than the other. I wish they were more consistent with these.   The pastries are a bit pricey, so I haven't tried any of those. I bought one of those really dark energy bars though, with the semolina and stuff in it. I didn't like it at all. It was way too sweet and the texture was off. I wouldn't spend my money on it again.   It's nice to have a vegan place in the metro area, but besides the tsoynamis, there are better options for a good healthy vegan meal.",

I was so looking forward to trying their food but after ordering $38 worth of food and watching 75% of my food sitting for OVER 30 minutes... I was out. I don't think I would've left with a refund, if they had made all my food again that had been sitting there for over, OVER 30 minutes. Who wants to take home food that's been sitting there for over 30 minutes waiting for a bowl to be made?! I am patient waiting for food BUT watching my food sit on a counter for over 30 minutes...fried Ragoon, French Fries and Egglessrolls...yeah...no...sitting, no lamp either!  People that ordered maybe 20 to 30 minutes after me, we're getting their food and mine was just sitting there waiting for one item to be made. Now had I been sitting in the restaurant maybe it might have been different but do not offer to make my food over that had been sitting there for over 30 minutes, and I checked it it was pretty cold, was ridiculous. So horrible customer service, they may or may not have good food. I don't know, I won't try again. Good luck if you go just be very patient know that your food gonna take over 30 minutes to maybe an hour and 1/2 to get to your table, to at least an hour if you want to bowl. Now if you just simply want one of their burgers, it seems like their cook is pretty quick on that. Otherwise, if you got 45 minutes to maybe an hour & 1/2 to get your food, be patient relax and maybe they're good.  The one guy that is short and has a Wolverines facial hair...got visibly frustrated with me when I asked to have my fries redone, the fries that had been sitting there for over 30 minutes, they were cold?! Sue me for not wanting cold fries! So once he did that and got frustrated with me; I was pretty much done. Asked for my money back and when he brought the fries back he SNATCHED the bag of cold food away from the table when the girl told him I was getting a refund. Really, food sitting for over 30 minutes and you want me to take that home?!  By the way, ordered at 1:03, bowl still not done at 1:55 p.m., who knows, might still be there at 2:27 p.m. still waiting:-( Might have been different if they had asked me if I wanted recooked but that was not offered, I tried to suggest it...but...",

I feel like $3.75 is a little pricey to have to pay for that side of fries, but they were pretty yummy fries. The big wac was massive! I loved the sauce on it. Honestly didn't care as much for the patties but I think that's just my personal taste. Was a nice big meal though! The friend I went with got a mock chicken BBQ sandwich and a tsoynami that had a bunch of stuff on it, she enjoyed it!  A little pricey but cool place to go try something new. I'd like to come back and maybe try some tacos!",

In fact, I usually end up at Green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it's \"Food you can eat that I actually like.\" Every dish is addictive, flavorful, saucy, and filling. Classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl, the singapore tofu bowl (although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on), the vegan BBQ chicken sammich (I just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor), and then there are the eternally awesome specials.  Even though you'll probably be stuffed post-meal... make room for dessert. It's mind over matter anyway. Order a Tsoynami - they're like McFlurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins. Standouts include Tsoynamis  filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge, bananas, kitkats, hazlenut brittle, mint oreos and more.  On another note, this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the Tempe/Scottsdale area with a lively, hip atmosphere. Even if you love steak more than anything in the world (and there are steak po'boys, might I add) at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place.",

The vegan wings here were ok, but nothing like other places I've had. We were hoping they'd be more like buffalo wings, but the sauce was far more Asianic.    That said, everything we have ordered (dumplings, samosas, stir fries, sandwiches) has been good, just not quite outstanding.  I love their Thyme fries though -- delish.  Service was a bit slow, but I've learned that this is standard fare in vegan/veggie places, so it didn't bother us much. The people watching, plus artwork on the walls, made the time pass quickly, and the staff themselves were incredibly outgoing and friendly.  I definitely want to go back and try an Tsoynami -- they're just a little pricey.  Will have to wait till I'm really craving.  I love that they have lots of vegan items for sale; they have some hard to find things that lots of my vegan friends love. It's hard not to overspend.  I like their tea/limade/tamari drink options as well; can be fun if you mix them, and I love that their cups are compostable!  All in all, a great vegan spot to get something comforting, but can be a little pricey for a \"quick service\" style place.",

    "text": "A really great restaurant, this deserves to be said first, and the best vegan/vegetarian in Tempe.  Going on my best of Tempe list.  If you are one of my anonymous followers on Yelp, you know I love meat.  When we make plans to eat at Green, I get excited because the food is great despite the fact that there is no meat.  They just make great food at Green.  I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food.  Never had one that tasted good, but it is fun trying them all.  Maybe one day I'll start worrying about my sugar intake.  And the tSoynami's are really good, but closer to a dessert than a drink.  The wings were suggested to me on my first visit, which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant, but . . . they were great and I get them all the time.  I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into.  My mostly vegetarian daughter lives off of cheese and mushroom pizza, but couldn't stomach the vegan verity.  Now she has the crab puffs and peanut tofu appetizers.  And my vegetarian wife gets whatever she wants and doesn't have to ask about unmentioned ingredients, which I have been told is a rare and liberating experience.  The layout of the interior provides a friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.  A few more visits to Green, and I'm sure my daughter will know what I'm talking about.  And our Tempe location, the original location, is better than your Phoenix location.  There, I said it.  But maybe I should try the Phoenix location first.",

The various sandwiches that I ingested were flavorful and filling (as 2 sandwiches often are).  The mock chicken parmesan was all I could have asked for: crispy and saucy, not too tough, and delightfully messy to eat. The Soynami was over the top heavenly: chocolate and peanut butter having a meeting in a cup and I was the chairman of the board.  It makes visiting Arizona fun!

My friend ordered the sweet & sour tofu and said it was OK. Since we were hitting a bunch of restaurants this night, I didn't have a main course, but I DID get the \"tsoynami\".   Speaking to the tsoynamis, they are delicious. Soy based ice-cream blizzard treats. I didn't realize how much I had missed milkshakes since going pescatarian, and this tasted like it came from Dairy Queen (I got the cookies-n-cream tsoynami). All the yummy goodness of a blizzard w/o any of the stomach aches, health issues, or moral issues (or whatever reason you've given up dairy).   The rest of the menu looks innovative and tasty and I wish we had more time in Scottsdale to try more items.   If you were to compare this to a non-vegan place, I don't know if it would rank as high. But, for what it is, this place seems to have found a niche and is doing it well.  **things to note** This place is almost impossible to find. It is tucked away in a corner in a non-descript strip-mall (by a car dealership if I remember correctly). If I didn't have GPS, I would have given up on trying to find it. Also, the employees are all kinda dirty looking - expect hippy-types with dreadlocks and piercings and stretched earlobes. While I respect everyone's personal choices, I also appreciate hygiene in the people who are preparing my food... just sayin'....",

    "text": "Oh Green, how do I love thee....so much that I fantasize about salads and tsoynamis.  I've been to both the Tempe and Phoenix locations, including the cafe/bakery/sister restaurant, Nami. I am a 23 year vegetarian,  part time vegan. My SO is a Nebraska bred, meat and potatoes kinda guy. We both love Green. I'm convinced,  if you don't like Green, there's something broken in your mouth...now the important stuff... Ambience. ...hip, funky, casual, sometimes hectic...and all in a good way. Not intimidating.  No too hippy dippy. Just clean, bright, and creative. There's tons of seating inside and at the Tempe location,  a patio. The staff are 99% of the time cheerful and friendly...on one occasion we got a surly server/cashier but it wasn't bad enough to ruin our visit.  FOOOOOOOD... Well where to start..i order the Ranchero salad every time I eat here. Tender, mixed baby greens, crunchy tortilla strips, carrot shreds, creamy ranch and Green's yummy yummy barbecue \"wings\"...it's perfect. Speaking of wings...these are amazing. Meaty texture, zesty sauce and the cucumber ranch and veg that accompany it are refreshing and delicious.  This is my guy's go to. With the thyme fries...that are so crispy.... The perfect fry. We had the fries with chili once and unfortunately/fortunately we decided it wasn't for us and that I make a far meaner, and superior veggie chili. Moving on....on my very first visit I tried the Kung pao with mock chicken noodle bowl and was not a fan. Watery, too sweet, too salty yet bland sauce, slightly too al dente noodles...it just wasn't what I expected.  We also split a  Wendy's pickle. It's a mock fried chicken cutlet with pickle and spicy vegan mayo. It was warm and soft and tastes so much like chicken I was slightly scared it was real..on subsequent visits, we tried the 'thee argentine poboy\"...grilled mock steak and caramelized peppers and onions with mayo and a spicy sauce. The steak had crispy bits, tender bits and was so flavorful. I would've loved more vegetables. ..there were 2 pieces of pepper on the whole sandwich. .but the part that stands out the most, oddly enough was...the bun. The fluffiest, most perfect bun ever. I want every sandwich I eat to be on that bun. We also ate the BBBQ bacon burger. Veggie patty, portabella cap, bacon, bbq sauce,  mushrooms onions and mayo. This burger was so rich and delicious and big.  We split it and I couldn't finish my half. Green also offers daily, off - menu, specials. We got a Carne asada nachos, which were ok. Tasty, but not enough carne, and too many dry chips. The most recent special I tried was a rueben sandwich.  The sandwich was huge! Tons of Seiten steak, thousand island, vegan cheese and sauerkraut on rye. It came with fries, (you can get fruit, fries, coleslaw). Very tasty. My only beef is with the price tag. Both specials I tried were $12 which is $3+ more than the regular menu  items. Which isn't a lot by any means...but the specials i tried weren't Green's best dishes..  At Green you can get water, or one of their delicious, refreshing drinks...lime, berry lemonade, iced tea, and vimto. I have no idea what vimto is..maybe it's vitmo..anyway..i don't know what it is, but I know it's red, mildly sweet and delicious. There's also some bottled kombucha, boxed water, other bottled juices as well as beer! on tap. Local favorites from 4 peaks brewery and more. And super reasonably priced. . $3 for a kiltlifter.    If by some chance you have any room left, do yourself a favor and get dessert. The s'mores tsoynami is so good. Creamy soft serve, chocolate, graham crumbs and rice fluff...soo goey. Ive had a lemon ginger tsoynami as well and it was scrumptious. You can buy pastries and other goodies too including take and bake cookies. And the desserts are reasonably priced too. Seriously. . $4.50 for a huge tsoynami.  Suck it DQ.    I almost forgot! Nami does sunday brunch and Monday through Friday breakfast and Green frequently holds special dinners...a carnivore conversion dinner, holiday meals..and Green and Nami cater.     I also wanted to mention a few details...   Ordering is done at a counter. You're given a number and a server brings you your food. You clear your own table. There are condiments like hot sauce and tamari available. The kitchen tries to use organic whenever possible.  Long review short..i love Green.  It's delicious, vegan comfort food. Not even \"comfort food\". It's the food you, as a vegetarian,  dream about finding on the menu at a restaurant. No more crappy side salad and fries! No more frozen, did they cook this on the meat grill, veggie burgers! Enough of me typing...You should just go and love it too.",

I'll admit I was a little skeptical about the whole vegan thing but they proved me wrong.   I get the Thai spicy \"chicken\" salad. It is the perfect amount of spice for me, not too spicy but just enough to give it flavor. The \"chicken\" is so good and flavorful. If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken I would have been fooled. Their oatmeal cream pie just the right finish to the meal.   The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere.",

My boyfriend is from Mesa, and he loves this place and wanted to eat there as much as possible while we were in town for the holidays. I loved it! I can understand why he wanted to go here so much!  The first time we went I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich and eggless rolls. Both were very good. The chicken on the sandwich was very good as well as the sauce and the bun. I ordered fries as the side and they were the best fries of my life. Skinny little crispy but not too crunchy delicious fries. I pretty much hate all other fries now because of Green. The eggless rolls were good too and I really liked the sweet sauce they came with. My boyfriend ordered the original g spicy po-boy. It was good, but I think the sandwich I ordered was better.  The second time we went we split the no harm chicken parm and eggless rolls. It was that good.  The third time (second time in 1 day) we went we split the meatball po-boy and fries. It was really good! We also ordered a tsoynami that had chico sticks and chocolate chips in it. It was seriously like eating a Blizzard it was amazing!  I plan on trying to recreate it at home, but it probably won't be as good as Green's.   Green is a great place to go for vegans and non vegans. The prices are fair and the service is quick even though it seems busy all the time. They have a million drink choices and a varied menu. I also liked how you ordered at the counter, and bussed your own tables which I don't mind doing at all especially when there is a line of people waiting for seating. I will definitely go back several times next time I am in town.",

Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites etaient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!  Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.

That's been one item going vegan that I miss, and to be honest; I think the vegan are better than any \"real\" ones. The big wac, extra pickles and the Wendy pickle sandwich are my favorites. My husband loves the big wac, of course, and then the philly sandwich. The cookie dough to take home is where it's at though. This place is perfect for a new vegan and someone missing those comfort foods. Perfection!!",

    "text": "Well this adventure started off as a simple quest to try out Green's tsoynami. Somehow the quest grew and sent Joyce W. and I on an epic journey of wondrous taste and exotic delights. Calvin put it best when he said, \"Some days even my lucky rocket ship underpants don't help.\" You know that feeling when your stomach says no more but your taste buds are jumping up and down as if they were in a club yelling out, \"More!\"? Well Green does that to you. I'm not a big vegetarian but if my own dishes always tasted this good, I wouldn't mind. I had their special, RocknRolled tacos with a side of addicting fries... nami nami so good in my tummi. Then washed it all down with their delicious drinks. However it doesn't end with the taste or super smells but there are the sights. The place is decorated in an artsy cool urban look which gives Green a unique flare all its own. Amazing!",

Walk in usually there's a small line, grab a menu near the only register and choose your items. Don't be like Susan who waits last minute to look at the menu at the register holding up the line. You order and they bring the food to your table.  My top 3 favorite dishes: Thai Peanut Mock chicken bowl, BBQ Mock Chicken sandwich, and Jerk Tofu Salad. Jerk Tofu is tangy and over a bed of greens is like flakes of heaven.  If you need a little more bites: Thyme fries, just skinny fries with thyme. Buffalo \"Wings\" are delicious, they're just like the real thing, but a little chewier. If you like curry, the samosas are superb. I could eat 3 orders of them throughout a binge marathon on Netflix.  If you still have some room in your tummy, you MUST get a Tsoynami! They have seasonal flavors and their standard ones. I usually try the seasonals, but PBnJ is also my jam *pun intended.   The staff is friendly and good at giving you some recommendations, if you decided to pull a Susan.",

    "text": "I'm a Los Angeles native and have access to some of the best vegan food in the world. That said, my \"vegan-restaurant-expectations\" are pretty high! (^^) Green delivers on all fronts and is a MUST go-to-stop for an absolutely phenomenal bite to eat. Seriously, if you're in the Phoenix or Tempe area you've got to go to Green.   My dad and I attended a conference in Tempe and happened upon this gem of a restaurant. We were impressed by the ambiance, the staff and of course the cuisine. (Side note for you gamers out there, the soundtrack to \"Zelda: The Ocarina of Time\" was on the whole time... WHAAAAT??)  The ambiance is retro and laid back, perfect for both hipsters (we have plenty of those in LA) and families. The staff is as unique and inviting as the ambiance. Our meals were delivered within minutes (for real) of us ordering, even though it was lunch time on a Saturday!   Now here's the best part, the food is AWESOME. Like I mentioned, I'm an LA native and have high expectations. Who wouldn't with dozens of highly rated vegan restaurant right in their backyard? My dad (who's more of your \"meat-and-potatoes\" kind of vegan) ordered the Kung Pao Bowl with mock beef and brown rice (spicy and yummy). I ordered the Peanut Sauce Bowl with pan fried noodles (nom nom nom). Also, we both shared the Buffalo Wings. Mock meats can be tricky but Green does a wonderful job with them, the texture is amazing! Our dishes were perfectly spiced and super filling.  Whether you're vegan or not, you'll enjoy Green!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.VeggieSoulFood.com&s=3dc13dafdf0444ef19df604edcdd6dbe599fd7a69a344bcb4e199c1e6d9b3043\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">VeggieSoulFood.com</a> i.g. @VeggieSoulFood tweets @VegSoulFood",

However, the concept and food here is so good that I just had to add an extra 5-star to the pile.  I opted for the Big Wac on my first day eating here, along with Buffalo Wings and a side of fries.  Everything was so good that I came back for lunch before heading to the airport to leave town.  On my second trip I got the BFF (fried chicken sandwich) and fries.  I travel extensively for work and have eaten at vegetarian/vegan restaurants all over the country.  This is one of the best ones I've ever been to.  It reminds me of Hip City Veg in Philly, if anyone has ever been there, but feels less like fast food and more like a cafe.  This is the type of vegan restaurant that you bring your carnivore friends to.  This is the type of place that makes them say \"Oh... this actually tastes good!\"  This is the type of place that has you asking \"How do they do it?\"  This isn't one of those vegetarian places that tries to be too healthy.  It serves burgers, milk shakes, and fried \"chicken\" sandwiches, but it is all delicious, and sometimes you want to indulge in a bacon cheeseburger with mayo - vegan style!  I highly recommend the place... check it out, you will not be disappointed!!",

We decided to order a variety of appetizers and planned on ordering our main entrees after the appetizers.  However we were so disappointed at the quality of the appetizers that we decided we had tried enough and left.  We had the samosas, buffalo wings, tofu satay with peanut sauce, and eggless rolls. The buffalo wings bordered on disgusting.  I was so disappointed because that is my favorite item to order when eating at Veggie Grill ( CA locations) or Native Cafe (locations in CA and other states). Green -  you need to take a lesson from either one of those two restaurants on how to make amazing buffalo wings!!! The remaining appetizers were just okay, not great.   About an hour after we ate, all three of us were having tummy issues and making emergency trips to the bathroom.   I really wanted to love this place as it is hard to find Vegan restaurants!",

This restaurant would be considered a TREAT (kinda like when non-vegans go to Red Robin or a steakhouse as a treat).  The food is priced right, tastes great, and it's a cool way to get your friends to try vegan stuff the non-scary way :).

    "text": "Where do I start, how about with desert?!  You can not go to Green and not get a tsoynami!  They offer many different flavors so why not just try them all, you won't be let down.  From fruit to chocolate and peanut butter, just pick one!  The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come True!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!  If you want something a little healthier I recommend one of the bowls or a salad of course.  Either way in my opinion you won't go wrong with whatever you try.  Vegetarian food has come a long way and I couldn't be happier to have so many options!!!",

But from what i remember they were good   samosas- this was the first time i had samosas and i thought they were ok, i personally didn't like them that much   i haven't had any of their salads or pizzas for myself   orcciette pasta- i really didn't like this that much, to much onion, But they tend to make things differently sometimes so maybe it just wasn't a good day for me And i got the chicken so maybe the meatballs would have been better   Thai peanut- this is my absolute FAVorite dish!!!! With mock chicken and noodles, its just so delicious. If you don't like peanut sauce though it might not be for you, even though i didn't originally think id like it, so hey you should just try it.   the original 'g' spicy po-boy - really good, its just the chicken wings but in a sandwich and bigger pieces of it in it hah its really good though   no harm chicken parm sandwich- from what i remember this was good   I've tried several variations of the soft serves and the tsoynami, and every one I've tried yet is delicious!   Hope you like it if you try it! haha,  Here's the link:   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenvegetarian.com%2F&s=913389b48d32e31cf847eb2f9c0a4e06a8483ed6c44ccfe371e2ba37ee9a2e93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">greenvegetarian.com</a>",

I don't ever think I'm getting \"healthy food\" when coming here it's definitely \"junk food\" as Ben H. said, but throughout the years, it's been a safe haven for me to go to with my crazy vegan friends. There just aren't that many good places for vegans in Phoenix-- especially for good old fashioned American food. Sure you can get vegan options at Indian, Ethiopian, and Asian places...but sometimes you just want that chicken parm sammy or that big burger that your diet or lifestyle choices must keep you from. Enter Green. Fast, relatively cheap, greasy comfort food. A little something for everyone and some of the finest faux-meats I have ever had. I really love the chicken cutlets and the steak sandwich is my absolute favorite. This is not for the weak of heart-- these creations are masterful and oily, but they sure do fill you up. Save some room though, you can't leave here without getting a Soynami--basically a McFlurry type thing made with soft serve coconut milk. It's amazing. Most of the food is around 3 stars,but I bumped it up to 4 because they're ahead of the vegan game for Tempe/Phx and gosh....that Soynami!",

I had the Wendy's Pickle Sandwich, Chicago Cheesesteak, and Animal Fries  The Wendy's Pickle is a mock Buffalo chicken chicken sandwich on a Ciabatta roll, and it's actually pretty decent. You can tell it's not real chicken, but the flavor it has is good on its own. The reason it's called the Wendy's \"Pickle\" is because it's loaded with pickles...I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was happily content.  My daughter had the Chicago Cheesteak and I found myself wishing I ordered it, because it was pretty tasty. It consists of mock steak filled with onions and peppers, the only thing it was missing is mushrooms...that would have sealed the deal, but it was good nonetheless.  My granddaugther had the Animal fries, which is a vegan version of the In & Out classic, it had vegan cheese, onions and Thousand Island sauce, and it was addicting.  I washed the meal down with a classic Margarita which was above average, the restaurant was a mix of hipster and grunge, and the staff was attentive - I'll be back!",

And we were so happy we did!   Terrific menu of super tasty, vegan food. We shared the faux bbq 'chicken' wings to start.  Super good.  Then I had a burger with 'bacon,' and couldn't believe I wasn't eating beef. My wife liked her tofu rice bowl.    And we both LOVED the tsoynami dessert.  (There we're so many to choose from, which all sounded great). We picked one with chocolate soy cream, bananas, organic peanut butter and rice 'marshmallow' fluff.  I think it was called a fluffernutter, or something silly like that.  But it was amazing.    Good atmosphere too. the place was busy with lots of college students and young couples on dates  (some stopping just for a tsoynami to go), but the counter service moved quickly.  The food was brought to the table quickly and hot. And everyone working there was nice and seemed happy.  Made for a really pleasant dining experience.    Hope they open one (or more!) of these in LA soon.  They'd be a huge hit!!",

There's a variety of bowls--we had the Asian bowl but they also had curry and others. All looked amazing. You can have tofu or imitation beef or chicken. We opted for the beef, it was sooo good. A little spicy too.   We also opted for the appetizer of queso fundido with chips. It had spinach and tasted freaking amazing.  We also split a crispy chicken sandwich. It had vegan crispy chicken, jalapenos, vegan cheese, and other yummy stuff. By far my favorite vegan crispy chicken sandwich of all time.  Oh and for dessert have a soynami. I don't care if you are full just do it! You will be so happy.  There's a poke gym too here for you Pokemon go players!",

A handful of times staff has had an attitude with me when I'm picking up food. For example: I saw food that looked like what I ordered waiting and I asked if my food was don't and he was like \"calm down we're really busy\" as if I was trying to be rude by asking. And once by boyfriend was told by a green employee who was ringing him up that if you're picking up an order you placed on the phone you can just skip the line and say that you're picking up. When I went to do this the cashier gave me a look so I went to the back of the line and waited and when I got up there I asked said \"So you wait in line if your picking up orders?\" And he said \"that's generally how that works!\" in a snarky tone. There have been other little things that have happened but off the top of my head these stick out the most. I pick up food here a lot because it's the closest vegan restaurant to me but I definitely recommend the other location more. An important note is that I'm 18 and just learning how to do all of this by myself so I'm not the most familiar with the etiquette of ordering or picking up food.",

This place is pretty popular, I believe I waited 10 minutes in line to place my order. I decided to keep it simple and order the dagobah jungle salad. I'm not a fan of processed soy based food, which made it difficult to explore the menu like I really wanted to. The wait for my salad was even longer, there were no clean tables and it was clear that they were understaffed.   Finally my food arrives, and after taking the first... I was genuinely impressed. The dressing was delicious and I love the jerk inspired fried Brussel Sprouts! I would recommend this place for anyone that wants to try something new, but I'll be sure to either arrive right when they open or call in your order for pickup.",

I didn't taste the thyme. That being said, I didn't go there for the fries. James shared his Big Wac with me, and I wished I had ordered the same. It's all in the sauce, it tastes like a real-deal Big Mac.   To drink, I wanted to try their Berry Lemonade, and it was the perfect summer drink. I also tried the Lime. Very tasty, and not as sweet as the lemonade. I'll get that one again for sure. For our after lunch treat, we shared a Peanut Butter bar, and an incredible Tsoynami shake. Both were amazing, we were impressed at how well each item was prepared. I need to take better care next time, because I could very easily pack on the pounds at this place.

    "text": "So, it is kind of hard to rate this place. On one hand, my wife and I went here because we are pretty healthy eaters when it comes to our meals - she's practically vegetarian and the only meat I eat on any regular basis is lean chicken, and we both freshly prepare most of our meals with low salt and low fat. So, coming here, you get a very good vegan replication of what are high fat, high salt meals, which people like us don't like. So, was my Calexico burger an excellent replication of a traditional american double burger with cheese down to the very color of the cheese? Yes! Do I actually like traditional american double burgers with cheese? No. Chicken wings, were exceptionally good despite their high salt content, the flavors of the sauce were very much enhanced by the salt, rather than being overwhelmed by it.  If you go here with a full understanding of what you are getting, you will like I it. They have a very varied menu and speedy service. I would definitely go back and try out some other things on the menu that people mentioned in the yelp review, I think the food concept and execution is very, very good and wish we had this amongst our dining options in New Jersey. I wouldn't go here frequently, but I would go here about twice a year, to get something different - which is almost exactly the same as standard fast food, but completely different because its vegan. It's all very confusing :)",

I have read some reviews claiming how unhealthy this place is for Vegan food. I think that's hilarious! Anything vegan is a healthier option than the \"real thing\" any day of the week! I don't know about you, but I don't eat French fries because I think they're healthy. I eat it once in a while because they're delicious duh!

    "text": "My husband and I are vegetarians, and make a point of eating at local veg establishments when we travel. I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing.   We've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when \"vegan\" meant \"bland,\" \"underseasoned,\" \"hippy\" cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description.  I was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about \"Chef Damon's\" vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas.  Still, if the food had been good...  I ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler.  Almost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving.  The samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing.  My husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \"French Fries\" and have done with it.  My take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it. If this is the best Scottsdale has to offer vegans, you're better off cooking at home.",

Between 6 of us, we tried the pizza, several of the bowls (apricot was awesome!),   edimame, Hummus, peanut thai tofu, artichoke dip, crab puffs, and 4 different desserts.  everything was wonderful!    the only negative in the entire meal was that our group thought the artichoke dip was runny but flavorful.   we got there for lunch right as they opened at 11 and were served first...the place was full very quickly after that.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and talked to us \"newbies\" at length about the menu, how to order, and what the vegan cheeses were like.  They even brought us samples of the ice cream to help us order! We will definitely be back, thanks for a great time and a great meal! Richard and the APS crowd:)",

The thyme fries were perfectly seasoned and not at all greasy. They were a little thin and \"stick-like\" for my preference but I still ate all of them! That's the only reason I gave the place four stars instead of five.   I had no complaints about the staff and my order was brought to my table in no time. I'll definitely be returning to Green!",

I ordered the samosa appetizer that came with a cinnamony dipping sauce. This is the first time I've had samosas that were not heavy & greasy. My main meal was the lemon pesto with mock chicken (carrots & zucchini were thrown in). Everything taste sooooo good. The pesto was so lemony and the mock chicken taste like chicken. It's been a really long time since I've had chicken and I hadn't realized how much I missed it. I'm taking another continuing education course next month and can't wait to eat here again.",

    "text": "4.5 stars. It's that high average over a huge number of reviewers that spurred me to eat here four times before forming an opinion. Unfortunately, I have to say, you're all wrong.  It's really baffling to me how so many people apparently like this place. It's amazing that they actually managed to make vegan burgers taste *worse* than McDonald's. Their bowls? The texture is all off. The flavors were not balanced. I've tried four different entrees here, and all were terrible. The fries were also mediocre.  It's like it's vegan food for people who don't actually want to be healthy.  What's really interesting about this Yelp rating is I decided to ask a few friends if they have eaten here, just to scope out what the general non-Yelper population thinks. I asked one of my fellow carnivore friends, and his opinion was \"It's shit.\" Just this past weekend I asked a mostly-vegan friend what she thinks of Green. \"Shit.\" Nobody minced words. All the real people I know seem to agree: it's shit.  I personally like the idea of reducing meat intake; it seems like the moral *and sustainable* thing to do. Believe me, I'm not some anti-vegan, Ronald Reagan-worshiping Republican; I can't stop eating at the delicious, all-Vegan Desert Roots Kitchen. I'll even order black bean burgers at normal restaurants (which are almost always an order of magnitude better than those flimsy, feeble patties they have here). This is just bad food. The only thing worth eating is the tSoynamis.  If you think about it, by serving up this terrible, overpriced vegan food, they're encouraging me to go eat more meat. How immoral.",

Off the bat: pretty busy (granted it's a Saturday but this isn't a prime location - this is a destination concept and this location is tucked right next to the Salvation Army store). I didn't realize it was quick casual (you order like a fast food place but they bring you your meal). Great beer, wine and cider selection. Couple of fresh brewed teas in addition to a reach-in cooler full of beverages.   Menu looked pretty decent! I wanted to try so many items but I know I am not a big eater so I settled on the cheese chili fries. They were so good! I paired with a cider since they aren't always available in PHX. I'm coming back for the spicy tomato pasta number next time.  I am so excited to see they have almond milk shakes! Dairy is not my friend and ice cream pretty much kills me even though it is the most amazing thing on Earth. I'm having one of those with my daughter next time. She'll be thrilled I can have some ice cream with her.  All-in-all, a great find. Looking forward to another great visit. As I write this review, the line is out the door. That's really great to see in this neighborhood.  Ps - really read the reviews. If you are having a bad experience, speak up to someone who is running the joint; chances are it's not them, it's you.",

I am not vegan, but I have an egg allergy, which makes eating dessert hard sometimes :'(  Green holds a special place in my heart because it was the first place I ever ate dinner at in Arizona. When I moved to Arizona my mom (who also has an egg allergy) came out to look at apartments with me. We were staying around the corner at the Holiday Inn in Old Town, where they recommended we eat at Green for vegan food. We then returned every day for either lunch or dinner for the remainder of our trip. Once I arrived in Arizona I used to get Green at least once a week, generally as take out. Everything is delicious, not really super healthy for the most part but I can deal with that when I am eating vegan food sometimes! I also don't think that is the goal here, I believe Green is taking a vegan twist on comfort foods and they do it well. I used to get a Coffee Tsoynami and the Calexico Burger--so good, but you'll need a siesta afterwards.  I personally prefer when not a lot of meat substitutes are used in vegan food, which is the only reason why I am giving Green 4 instead of 5 stars. Most dishes use a meat substitute like seitan or tofu, though I'm sure you can avoid this by ordering something else with beans for example. I feel sad I never went to Nami in my time out in Phoenix and when I visit next I will need to try their food out too in addition to returning to Green!",

Everything I've ordered has been tasty.  The mock chicken is pretty convincing. You can't beat the taste or price. Finally vegan doesn't feel like a deprivation.

As a long time vegetarian my girlfriend and I have visited several vegetarian and vegetarian friendly places throughout the valley and always end up coming back here. Their food is spectacular and the staff is always very nice. Try the Buffalo wings or the crab puffs. The BBQ chicken sandwich is good too but a bit simple. If you're in Tempe (and possibly Phoenix) try the soynamis they're awesome.",

    "text": "Holy cow! I love Green! It's awesome to have a menu full of nothing but vegan dishes in a somewhat veg-unfriendly city like Phoenix.  My carnivore husband loves it too and talks it up to people just as glowingly as I do.  They always have great specials. Just recently they had a great turkey pesto sandwhich which sounds kind of ordinary, but it was way better than anything I can make at home. Their taco special with mock shredded beef was killer. They even have a Big Wac if you miss that nasty burger from McDonald's.  My favorite dishes are the No Harm Chicken Parm and Meatball sandwich. Their marinara is so flavorful! Lots of garlic, just how I like it. When I lived 10 minutes away and got take out, I could barely keep myself from eating while I was driving because it smelled sooooo good.  When I'm aiming for something healthier, I get their stir-frys with extra fresh tofu, no rice. Apricot miso is my favorite of the bunch. Salads are great too, but then I usually feel compelled to order a delicious tsoynami to undo their health benefits.",

    "text": "While I love Green and I have reviewed before about how fantastic it is, I've since noticed certain things on several occasions.  #1. When I order take out the portions are always smaller than when you are in the restaurant. I get home thinking I'm going to be able to share with my fiancee only to find that it is a much smaller portion than at Green. Just today I called in for takeout, and for how much the wings and crab puffs cost you barely get anything. Definitely doesn't seem worth it. Vibe buster.  #2. The mystique has sort of worn off and I'm now seeing Green for what it really is: a vegan's junk food spot. Which isn't a bad thing since we all need one of those, but it's sort of disheartening to those that'd like to be a bit more healthy. Not all of their foods are complete junk food but I wouldn't call it healthy.  #3. They're pretty secretive about what's in their food. I went up to the counter to ask where they get their mock chicken from (because it's freakin' delicious and I pretty much hate all other mock chicken I've tried). The guy I asked basically babbled some spiel about how they go through so many distributors and get them from all different places. Knowing full well that he was basically saying he couldn't tell me, I asked anyway if he could tell me a specific brand name and he said no. Any other veg place I've eaten at has been more than happy to divulge this information. Did that suddenly make me stop going because I wanted to make all of the dishes at home myself? Of course not. The whole point of eating out is for the fun of it. That really bummed me out.  Green, I hate to say it, but you've kind of disappointed this vegan. Now I'll sulk away and go research Google for some awesome mock chicken.",

    "text": "I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.  We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.  Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for \"chili fries\" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't \"chili\" in any capacity that I would recognize.  In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.  My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with \"mum's sauce\" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.  The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.  The atmosphere was \"hip\" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare \"WE'RE VEGAN!\" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it.",

They had an interesting variety of sandwiches and stir fry with tofu or fake meat toppings.  It seems like they are more on the \"fake meat\" instead of \"eat something else\" side.  Personally, I'd prefer to stay away from meat substitutes so I got my dish with tofu.  I had the Thai peanut with the tofu (fried not soft).  It was a nice serving of vegetables with a strong peanut sauce with a bit of spice.  Not that much spice so unless you can't take anything, you will be able to eat it.  There are a large numbers of tables and chairs and a more limited number of booths.  If you go around dinner time it will be fairly full or busy.  Not so bad if you don't mind popping in for some quick food.",

    "text": "I'm not a vegetarian. At all. Never have been, truly cannot envision a world in which I ever will be. That being said, I adore Green.  I forgot it existed for a really long time, and fairly recently rediscovered the Scottsdale location. It's not too far from my house, and definitely on my drive home from work... So I foresee this becoming an issue. We went to take out a few dishes on a Friday night, because February-March is the time of year when my life becomes consumed by college basketball, and there was an Arizona game on that night. The line out the door was a little daunting at first, but moved pretty quickly. Pro tip: If you order and pay online, you can mosey on right past all of the peasants in line and just pick your order up at the counter.   Pro tip 2: If you order a tsoynami at the same time as the rest of your food, it gives you pretty much the perfect amount of time to scarf down the tsoynami while you're waiting for your order to come out. Our tsoynami of choice on this trip was the Fluffernutterin. Peanut buttery, banana-y, toasty marshmallowy greatness, combined with the swirlytwirly ice cream of course. It doesn't even taste soy based. It just tastes like heaven.   We decided to share the animal fries. French fries are some of my favorite things in the entire world, and cheese right alongside it, so I was pretty skeptical about vegan cheese ruining one of my favorite dishes. But realistically, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference between vegan cheese and normal American cheese (because let's be honest, it's hardly even real cheese). The fries were excellent, just a tiny bit soggy from the drive home. The onions fried perfectly, and the thousand island flavorful without being too acidic. I was also hesitant about the $5.50 price tag, but you get a TON of fries. Definitely would/will get again.  I'm totally fine to have vegetarian meals here and there, but I'm not a big fake meat person; I have to imagine a big percentage of it is mental, but I feel like fake meat usually makes me feel unwell. So, I opted for the Thai Peanut Bowl, with the house tofu. Best call. Their house tofu is amazing; fried to perfection, it absorbs the sauces but doesn't get soggy and fall apart. The sauce on the bowl was really tasty, just spicier than I was anticipating it'd be (I'm kind of a baby when it comes to spice though). The brown rice was just a little bit overcooked, it seemed a bit dry. The veggies in my bowl seemed to be in kind of a weird limbo state between being raw and cooked... I think I would've preferred them to be left on the pan for just a few minutes longer. Overall, pretty tasty. Just could've used a tiny bit extra love.   Undoubtedly, I will be back. Probably this afternoon to get my tsoynami fix. I'M NOT AN ADDICT, YOU ARE.",

When I first tried this place I was honestly not super open-minded I remember not being super thrilled being that I am not vegan myself. I have always been conscious of what I ate and have always tried to make healthy choices so I decided to give it a shot.   A year later, I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, funny how that happens sometimes. Unfortunately I cannot review too much of the menu items because once I tried their vegan burger I have been loyal to it since. The vegan burger is so incredible and probably the closest tasting to real meat that you can get! The thyme fries are also a great add on to the meal as well! I have also ordered the Po-Boy which is a buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich which is also incredible as well and I occasionally switch up my pallet with that as well.   Before you leave this place however you have to try their famous tsoynami! Again, I only have tried one flavor, which is the cookie dough one, and I add mint which is so YUMMY. Their vegan cookie dough is so delicious I have to get it every time I am there.   All in all I could talk about this place for days or you could just make the right choice and try it for yourself! You seriously will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "While vacationing in Arizona me and my other half dined in Green nearly every night during our stay and we loved this place. Green is a classic American restaurant that's vegan and good for you!  Its safe to say I had nearly everything on their menu. Their West Coast Fries aka Animal Fries are amazing and work well with their sandwiches. Fries smothered with vegan American cheese, caramelized onions, and thousand island dressing make these fries killer!  The Chicago Cheesestake, BFF, Secret BBQ Sammie, Classic Burger are all great sandwiches which feature top quality meat alternatives. I tried each sandwich and they were all great. However, their top sandwich in my opinion is their Big Wac which if you've been living under a rock is mock up of a Big Mac. Two mock meat patties, special sauce, lettuce, vegan cheese, pickles, onions, all on a sesame seed bun!  If you find yourself in these parts and need to eat vegan/vegetarian I suggest you give this place a go. I'd definitely return!",

If you're looking for a place with solid meat alternative dishes (i.e. instead of a po boy with shrimp, they'll use seitan, and vegan versions of everything that comes with it) you need to check this place out. The only thing I'm not the biggest fan of is the milkshake, but I'm sure others will love it. Everything else I've had (po boy, fries, brussels, Chicago cheesesteak to name a few items) was excellent.   Highly recommend.",

My friend's crab puffs were burnt twice also. Just because you are vegetarian, doesnt mean you think any type of vegetable is ok to serve any old way. No one seemed concerned about our repeat send backs. Not good customer service, and poor quality food. Clean your fryer, Green and think about repeat customers...I won't be one of them.",

It has a real nice lengthy menu and a solid feng shui when you walk into the restaurant. If your ever in the area or just don't know what to eat, vegan wise you have to tap into the green restaurant. And if you don't know what to get I'd recommend that dagobah jungle burrito... pure love! Thank me later! And save the animals  wellconnected way",

Their mock chicken is really tasty, but eat it when it's nice and hot. The texture changes slightly when it's cold.   The Dogobah salad with crispy Brussels sprouts is really good.   Last summer, I brought about 6 or 8 people from a conference here with me and ended up being a big hero everyone loved it so much.   Don't leave without trying a Tsoynami frozen soy dessert. It is really a great treat.   Check out their Tip Jar...every day it's so creative and amusing.",

Every time I'm in Phoenix I have to stop here at least once for a fix. All of the salads are good with my favorites being the Peanut Chicken and the Dagobah Jungle. The crab puffs are a bit greasy in my opinion and didn't have much in the way of flavor so I'd personally skip those. Same with the burger, it simply tasted like a grocery store bought Boca burger.   If you have room, definitely get dessert! Their donuts, cookies, and etc are the bomb! Easily waaaayyyy better than their traditional counterparts. The Yankie Doodle cookie sandwich is my fave (two snickerdoodle cookies with frosting in-between). The Tsoynamis are a hit or miss in my opinion, sometimes swaying to the watery side instead of creamy.",

My favorite is their Big Wac burger....think Big Mac only better, kinda like a vegan burger on steroids LOL!!! It is the type of messy burger you can't put down once you pick it up and bite into it. You know, the goooood kind of messy!!! My hubby who is not vegan and doesn't like vegan food couldn't even tell the difference that it wasn't beef but plant based. That's exactly how good this burger is!!! Some other very tasty bites here where you would never guess they are dairy and meat free and all vegan based are Spinach Fundido Dip (perfectly creamy with just the right amount of seasoning and spinach, would never guess there isn't cream cheese or sour cream in it), Crab Puffs ( there vegan take on Crab Rangoon), Eggless Rolls (absolute perfection with the sweet spicy dipping sauce), Samosas (filled pastry pillows that sing in your mouth), and any one of their fries offerings. I think the only negative I can think of is that both my daughter and I agree that their hot sauce is way to vinegary. It over powers the sauce completely. We just don't know why they don't use Franks hot sauce as it's perfectly balanced and vegan. So I do recommend to steer clear of any dish that has hot sauce or just ask they omit it.",

I did however try their red velvet cupcakes, the cheesesteak, chili cheese fries and woc burger were all very awesome. You wouldn't even notice they were all vegan, I even got my bf to try the Woc and he was surprised cause he's not about that vegan life. Hot wings were also legit and the sauce they make is so good!

It'd be my 1st stop once off the plane, & my last stop before getting back on the plane. Now that I live here, I practically live there.   This is some of the best veg*n comfort food on the planet. I've had @ 95% of the regular menu items. My favs are:  Big Wac: a vegan version of the Big Mac that could fool even a carnivore. Delicious & super filling. (Those with smaller appetites may want to cut it in 1/2 or share it.)   Wendy's Pickle: crispy fried \"chicken\" pieces w/ vegan mayo, a spicy sauce, & of course, pickles. An explosion of flavor for your taste buds.   Argentine Po'Boy: savory seitan steak with perfectly grilled & seasoned onions & peppers, plus mayo & spicy sauce. mmmmmm Mouth-watering!  Original G Spicy Po'Boy: mock chicken in a buffalo sauce w/ vegan mayo. I get mine sans tomatoes & extra spicy. Amazeballs!   (You can request light spicy sauce if you're spice sensitive.)   There's a BBQ \"chicken\" sandwich & a BBQ Bacon Burger. Both are equally so amazing that I have to eenie-meenie-miney-mo in order to choose. Their BBQ sauce is excellent!  All of the above come with a side. I suggest the thyme fries. So fresh & tasty!  When I need something on the lighter side, I get: the Jerk Salad w/ mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing makes me want to beat my chest & proclaim, \"Me Jane!\"    My 2nd favorite salad is the Ranchero salad, which features their yummy BBQ \"wings.\" Go all out and add a side order of their buffalo \"wings\" for an epic party in your mouth.   The chili fries are very good...in the winter. I personally can't do chili in the PHX summers.   Then the chef comes up with these amazing specials, which they announce on their social media pages. Today, I had the San Diego \"Fish\" Tacos: crispy tofu (& I'm not a tofu fan) mock fish, in soft tortillas, with a special sauce. SO good!!   Don't you dare leave here without trying a Tsoynami (think dairy-free Blizzard). My favs are:  Soy Capitan (for a fruity sensation); Dough Boy (cookie dough, chocolate syrup & soft serve. Hello!); Cookies n' Cream (classic); & my own creation of pretzels, chocolate, & toffee nut syrup.   They'll sometimes have fresh baked goods too.   There's a small selection of vegan groceries.   They have a cold case with a large selection of beverages, including a very tasty Butterscotch Beer (non-alcoholic).   Nice decor. They have plenty of tables, but on a busy night, or during the lunch rush, it fills up quickly. I suggest calling in your order if you're in a hurry. There's a patio outside, but there's only one table at this time. (This may change once the weather exits Hades.)   Order at the counter, then take a number & commandeer a table.   The parking lot was recently repaved & remodeled, which has made for a better parking situation.   Green. Don't leave Phoenix without it!",

I got the samosas $6 (stuffed with curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic) served with a tamarind dip. Thai peanut bowl $8.50 (sauteed vegetables,mock chicken with pan fried noodles). Thyme fries $3 (one of the most popular items on their menu).  The samosas are an epic failure,i'd rather go to an Indian restaurant to get them. The thai noodle bowl was filling and the fries were good.The USP of this place i would say is the fact that they are Vegan and offer a Gluten free menu.The food is reasonably priced with decent portions.They also have outdoor seating.  Cheers!",

But they're all amazing and it's one of the few restaurants where I can say I've had a majority of the menu at one point or another.   But the burgers are where it's at. The fries are also amazing. They don't come with the burger anymore which is a bummer, but I'm also probably a few pounds lighter as a result so maybe it's for the best.   They have awesome specials and check out their tsoynamis as well. The one with captain crunch is amazing as is the raspberry one. Or the windmill, or... you get it, they're all pretty amazing.   They have a small selection of deserts although nothing to write home about. For that you have to go to their sister cafe, Nami. And that's a while other five star review.   Awesome employees. Good vegan food. Cool atmosphere. This place is the best.",

I made the decision over night, so when I woke up one day and had decided not to eat any animal products again, I felt totally lost. Green is where I went to get a meal that would actually fill me up for long enough that I could figure out what to eat next!   I could go on and on about this place. The staff is always wonderful, and I have actually had pretty much every single item on the menu and would recommend almost everything.   Being vegan makes dating difficult, but when a guy asks me, \"Where can you even eat..?\" I feel confident that whatever he likes, he'll find something he can enjoy if we go to Green. The local beer doesn't hurt the cause at all.   THANK YOU for being awesome, Green!!",

I can eat a couple of the salads and the coconut curry due to the overwhelming soy on the menu. I believe they have a decent number of gluten-free options if soy is not an issue. The few menu items I can eat are really good especially the green salad and the balsamic picnic salad. HOWEVER, I confirmed with the cook and staff the canola oil is NOT organic which means it is Genetically Engineered (GE) canola oil. You must ask what the oil is if you are ordering something that is cooked, sauteed, etc. To avoid the GMOs ask for EVOO or organic canola. I was told the soy is organic and should be free of GMOs.

We had the vegan chili fries, the green burger and the ice cream. Every single item was amazing. I was basically licking the chili out of the bowl. And the soy ice cream was better then any Haagen Dazs I've ever had.   I wouldn't consider myself a vegan/vegetarian or even a person who is generally interested in that kind of food.

The fact that you are writing a 1 star review and calling the new menu awful when you clearly said you haven't been in to try anything yet negates the trustworthiness of your entire review.   I go here a couple times a week so I have familarized myself with the new menu. First of all 75% of the menu is THE SAME. They got rid of the items that were boring and unpopular, except for the Green Burger which I do miss. You're sad about the sweet and sour being gone? Why don't you try something with actual flavor? The Singapore Orange and the Thai Peanut are delish, not to mention the same format as your beloved bowl just with a different sauce. And the Lemon Pesto and Alfredo bowls they added are sooo good.   Green does NOT use Boca patties, and it is petty to spread misinformation like that, especially when you are going off of secondhand accounts. They hand make their patties like always, they just make them in a different way. The Big WAC is a heavenly creature btw, so maybe try that before you continue whining.  And if my memory serves, they added ONE salad. If you look online, you can see they have six salads now. Six. Hardly contributing to the \"vegan stereotype.\" If you continue using your math skills, they have ten starters that are not salads (including the buffalo wings), eight different kinds of bowls, nine sandwiches, plus mac and cheese and their specials which always taste good. The majority of the menu is not salads, so you can quit your raging. Good riddance.  Green, lots of people love you, the new menu, and what you do for the Phoenix community. Please keep up the great work and ignore immature people throwing temper tantrums.",

My wife ordered a salad and said that she couldn't eat it; I tasted her salad and thought that it was OK.  The service is sub par the food is just OK (not great) we told them that this was our first time eating at Green.  They made no effort to insure that we had a nice dinning experience and the restaurant isn't particularly clean.

    "text": "Not a vegan or a vegetarian, but I am a fan!  First note: if you are looking for this place, pay attention to the map BEFORE you get in the car.  It's in the corner of a strip mall and is VERY easy to miss.  It's just south of McKellips, for assistance.  You will see a low to the ground sign that just says GREEN.  Turn in there; the place is in the corner.  Very small, very unassuming.  I tried this out because I am lactose intolerant and decided to just try eating a vegan meal to ensure no dairy was in my food.  I got the Thai Peanut and a Soynami.    The portion was large enough that I was able to split it into two bowls when I got home.  I got my Thai Peanut with brown rice and fresh tofu.  Now, I already love tofu, and this dish was fantastic.  Absolutely one of the best stir-fry type dishes I have had with tofu.  In fact, I was surprised that 1) it was so good and 2) it was vegan.   It was the type of meal that you keep eating even though you can feel yourself getting full because it's just so good.  Ditto with the soynami.  The texture was interesting, which made it seem less watery than many soy based desserts that I get.  I got mine vanilla, with chocolate chips and sliced almonds, and it was perfect.  Another case of \"I'm really full and should stop eating but hell with it, I'm already crashed out on the couch anyway\"...I wish you could get a half soynami because half of the Thai Peanut + half a Soynami would be a perfect meal.   I can eat a giant steak in one sitting, but this meal made me go into couch potato food coma mood because I was just so...full...  In my return trips, I have learned not to eat the entire bowl and to pace myself, but the call of the deliciousness and the great staff keeps me coming back again and again.  I don't know if it's healthy, I don't know how they do it, but I don't care...it's delicious.  Note:  I haven't tried any of the \"fake meat\" items--that just sounds weird to me...so no feedback on that. The decor is a bit odd, but it's one of those quirky joints you just learn to appreciate as a contributor to the \"local flavor\" category. PS: They have VIMTO!  I was seriously taken aback and laughing when I first saw this, but it definitely took me back to some Middle East travels...if you love Vimto, this is your place!",

    "text": "Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes.  Some of my non-stand-bys are hit-or-miss, but this is the perfect comfort food for anyone on the meat-eating spectrum.   Note: do not read \"vegan\" as \"healthy\". It's comfort food, which means in all likelihood it is greasy, cheezy (with a z because it's not real cheese), and food-coma-inducing.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think the staff here is nicer than at the Scottsdale location.  You can easily drop $15 on a casual meal/drink/add-ons, which is my only beef (ba-dum-CHA) with this place. Ingredients are good, and the \"meat\" is all made in-house (none of that weird packaged, preservative stuff), so I don't think it's totally unreasonable. This place has a cult following and national veg cred for a reason.

The food here is awesome! Vegetarian or not, everyone loves this place. The food is creative, delicious and made from fresh ingredients.  The mock meats are so good and so well prepared that you will forget it's mock. I LOVE the wings, especially the new jalapeno flavor and the \"original g\" or \"wendy's pickle\" are great choices, but so is everything else on the menu.  A tsoynami for dessert is a must, they have a long list of options, check them out, you will be in love.   You go up to the cashiers and grab a menu, take a seat and decide on your meal, then return the cashier to place your order. They will give you a number and bring out your meal, but there is no waiter service.   The ambiance is trendy, and laid back, very casual and welcoming.",

I used to eat meat with EVERYTHING, but let me tell you, I don't even miss meat with the mock-meat at Green. I pay a pretty penny for a meal at Green, but it is definitely worth every cent.

The place is grimy looking, with an open kitchen that looks like it could use a good cleaning.  The staff is indifferent and the food a complete let down.  Got there not long before closing - no hours posted so we weren't aware.  This was obviously a problem for the staff as they acted like all they cared about was going home.  Why didn't they just tell us that they couldn't prepare the food properly due to the kichen closing soon?  We would have just come back another time.    We ordered the samosa starter - cold in the middle, coconut curry with crispy tofu - was soggy like it came out of a microwave, flatbread pesto pizza - burnt around the edges and cold in the middle.    We were reluctantly given a refund, as the food was inedible (in fact they took the curry away and never bothered to bring anything back).   And to echo a few others on here - lose the styrofoam and plastic cups and cutlery!  How green is your restaurant?  Not very.  Update 11/15/12  Went back here a few weeks ago, this place has really improved.  Best thing was, they're actually using eco-friendly cutlery/cups, etc.  Wahoo!",

I've really enjoyed their crab puffs, pesto pizza, sweet & sour mock chicken bowl, salads.. and those tosynamis! yum!  At first I thought they were smoothies, but they're really more like soy soft serve ice-cream sundaes with mixers in them.  Tasty.  The prices are amazing for such \"novelty\" fare.

Food recommendations are:  classic pizza with just about any topping, pesto pizza is good but too rich for my tastes.  The wings, crab puffs, and chili fries are out of this world good.  Original G spicy po-boy [think buffalo chicken sandwich] and the argentine [think philly cheesesteak] are pretty much unmatched.  Order off menu the BBQ chicken sandwich!  Its AMAZING.   Jerk tofu salad ooooh how I miss you. And they make their own organic vegan soft serve?  AND they make them into tsoynamis [think DQ blizzard]?!  Yeah.  This place owns.  Basically, if you are lucky enough to be vegetarian in phx [hah] at least you have one great thing on every other vegetarian in more veg friendly cities.

I love real veg restaurants, they are so few and far between all those places that just serve a veggie wrap and think they are opening up their client base. You can tell Green is the real deal because they list chicken sandwiches, meatballs this, shaved beef that all without blinking.  I went for the original g spicy po'boy and the tahini coleslaw (say what?), followed by a small tsoynami...and perhaps a mini chocolate peanut butter bar. what, it's all health food right?   the po'boy, i will admit looked a little \"po\" with only 3 pieces of spicy chicken, but the flavor was great and i even thought (mayonnaise hater that I am) that the vegan mayo added to the flavor and richness of the sandwich. the coleslaw was just delightful, and i would never have been able to tell that my soft serve was vegan in a blind taste test.  i just saw Eric's review about the mint syrup and chocolate chips, so i'm heading back there for an after-dessert dessert.  the atmosphere is spare, i feel like they could toss a few more tables in there, on the left side where the tables were really far away from one another. There was cool soft music, and I liked that they have two sofas to chill on, and a mini market full of vegan goodies like meatless beef jerky and paul newman's pretzels.    Oh Green, you and I have such good times ahead of us...please bring napkins.",

I'm not a huge fan of the mock meats but I found it to be ok. I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad. Their fries are very delicious and soaked in a layer of grease, which is probably why they taste sooo good.  The staff is always nice and helpful.

As for the food...for starters, I've had the spring rolls which are greasy but ok, the crab puffs which are ADDICTIVE, the fake hot wings which are so similar to the real thing its a little scary. The hummus is intense, but good; however I wish the accompanying pita weren't fried. Green likes to fry.   The bowls are alright (would not recommend for takeout because they'll taste like the cardboard box) because the veggies are cooked well and the sauce flavor is good, I like the Mongolian, but I've had better tofu. The Singapore on the back of the menu is delicious.   The BEST thing on the menu is the Green Burger although I don't care much for the fries. The curry pasta salad is a good side option. mmmm the BEST Tsoynami is the Clunky Monkey- bananas, walnuts, chocolate :] If only I could get a Green burger fix past 9 pm!",

I am not a vegan or vegetarian, but I do not eat dairy due to a major intolerance to it.  I went today for my second visit. Everything is fried, fried and fried. Why so much grease? Why can't vegan also be healthy?  Today I got the Jerk Tofu Salad. It was just ok. It was some greens mixed with carrots (the pre-shredded kind from a package) mixed with an equal amount of these fried stick things. The tofu was fried. \"Jerk spiced house tofu\" doesn't scream deep-fat fried to me, but apparently I am wrong. The carrots weren't fresh. The dressing wasn't my fav. I even asked for a different kind, and I got some lemon stuff. It was alright, but nothing to write home about.   I've made better dressings at home with just a few easy ingredients. This was not a $9 salad. Not even close. I could make a better vegan salad out of the produce section at Trader Joe's. It would be fresher. Would a few vegetables kill them? Seriously. Geez.   Last time I went we got a few starters - crab puffs and some hummus. I found them both alright, but they were VERY garlicky. Like major garlic. EEeks. I like garlic, but let's get real here. I got the Green burger for my meal last time. It was ok. It felt very heavy and \"gloopy\" for lack of a better word. I don't understand why they have to put the ketchup on the burger for me. So strange. I got the pasta salad as my side -- the server's suggestion as her favorite. Well, I guess if you like heavy, mayo covered stuff you are in luck.   I would go back but only for the soynami. I got the chunky monkey once and it was good.  The only upside is that I can go here and order anything without having to worry about dairy, which I am very allergic to. So, I guess that's worth something.  But in short...I've seen more veggies in a Wendy's 99 cent side salad. Seriously.  The other poster who said \"grease with a side of fat\" is dead on the money. I think I need an oil change after that tofu. :P",

The customer service is excellent and they are friendly, and very nice to explain dishes if you don't understand anything.

The food was fantastic, the art & decor was very cool, and the prices were great.  I highly recommend this place to anyone (vegetarian or carnivore).  As stated in other reviews, the staff is friendly.  When we arrived for dinner, they already closed the kitchen (since it was after 9 PM).  Not only did they let us stay, but they made us a large amount of food.  We started with the spicy peanut tofu and the samosas, both had excellent flavor.  For dinner we had the drunken mushroom chicken and the singapore tofu.  The food was delicious.  However, if I had to suggest one change for the entrees, I would have liked it if they used less salt.  Another thing that impressed me was their organic green tea was brewed perfectly (some restaurants mess up their green tea by steeping too long or too hot ... but not them, it was just right).  The decor was very cool and I like the amount of art they had around the place.  One of my favorite features were the tabletops and the design that they had inked on the tops of most of the wooden tables.  Very cool!  If they ever decide to sell tables like that, I would certainly get in line :-)",

He had been waiting for 15 minutes for his sandwich, and it took another 10 for it to arrive. Not a good sign! 25 minutes for a sandwich! They were busy..but he didn't order anything crazy.   It was hot inside. The first thing I notice when I walk into a building, is how comfortable the temperature is. Green made me sweat.  I ordered an iced latte which was amazing. To eat, I ordered the coconut curry with chikn. The buddy I brought along, ordered the same thing, but with crispy tofu. It took about 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table..The potatoes in this dish were perfectly cooked, and tasty. Everything else in my bowl was mediocre...and actually kind of bland. The friend we ran into said Green's menu items are hit or miss. I will give it another try someday.",

Green is a testament that vegan/vegetarian meals don't have to consist of just a plate full of side dish vegetables. the prices are extremely reasonable and the interior decor is kind of like that \"kitsh-industrial-hippy\" look. customers order at the counter and the food is brought out quickly, and you self-serve drinks so the water glass is always full!",

I've been to a few of these types of restaurants.  This place has all the healthy entrees one could want without the \"flair\" of a pretentious hipster taking your order.  Best of all everything on the menu looks good.  They simply make things that people like without trying to \"reinvent the wheel\" with some sort crazy food combination/fusion.  I always enjoy eating at a place without having to read some detailed instructions from the chef on how the proper way of eating it should be for the best flavor. (Yes, it's happened)  Since I'm not entirely used to Arizona's 6 degrees hotter than hell heat I have gotten the tsoynamis and their peanut butter and chocolate crack bar.  It's the perfect fix for that sweet tooth craving that I get from time to time, or in this case three or four times this week.  I'm coming back tomorrow for lunch with my beautiful wife and I'm going for the buffalo \"wings\" because they've been calling me day and night.  This place is worth the 673 mile drive and the only bad thing I can say about it is that once I leave this weekend I'm going to crave this place.  Green, you've been good to me this week, you damn well better be here when I come back and don't change a thing!",

The flavor profiles are so delicious, the replacement for meats tastes so good (no weird textures or weird after tastes), and you don't feel like you have to be super healthy (although you can choose healthier options if you want).   The spicy buffalo wings, the chili fries, the big wac burger, and the samosas were DELICIOUS. The atmosphere is very casual and minimal, and the prices are great. I am so impressed!",

I'm really hesitant to use the \"v\" word here as to scare any individuals away, because it shouldn't.  I've been going to this little eclectic eatery about once a month for the past few years.  It's a great to take your vegetarian friends and even more fun to take the meat eaters too.  I've probably had pretty much everything on their varied menu that consists of Asian to american and a few little twists in between.  Definitely get a appetizer and while I like their salads, save it for a return trip if it's your first time.  If you like whatever it is on the menu at your favorite restaurant, you'll like it here too!  I absolutely love garlic and its a staple in most of their bowls and other items.  It's not overwhelming, but still noticeable and this is a  warning.  As for the tofu items, I've only sampled a bit and it seems to be good, but with the mock meats offered and how amazing they are from taste to texture, I save the tofu when I'm forced to go to some other vegan place that doesn't offer it and not quite as awesome either.  I'm a meat eater and have zero plans of changing.  However, if I got locked inside green for a month, I'd be quite the happy camper!",

I was just trying to find some place with a lot of options on the menu since the group I was with went to another restaurant with limited vegetarian options. As guilty as I temporarily felt about leaving my group, I 100% didn't after taking the first bite of food. It is incredible. I had crab puffs, blonde alfredo, vanilla ts'mores and a couple drinks. The beverages are okay. Nothing major. But the imitation crab puffs are delicious. I loved the vegan version of the blonde alfredo, especially with the chunks of vegan chicken. And as a former Girl Scout who ate entirely too many s'mores as a kid, I thought eating those were long gone as a vegetarian for over 10 years. Not so fast. I loved their ts'mores. I could've had another full cup of that alone. If/when I ever go back to Arizona, there is 100% chance I will revisit here. The prices are super reasonable. The service is casual and friendly. It can get packed in there, but because the weather is usually nice, what makes the crowds easier to withstand are a lot of people go outside and sit at the outdoor tables. Since there is no waiter service, people order from the front and get their foods sent to the table. I loved it. As much as I usually tend to lean towards quieter vegan and vegetarian restaurants, I liked that this one had a \"Noodles & Company\" or \"Chipotle\" vibe and speed. And again the food was mouth watering.",

    "text": "First, it must be understood that this is a review for the Tempe location (which is pretty much in the southern tip of Scottsdale but that isn't here and it isn't there either) that has been newly remodeled. I will not speak in length of the old decor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won't talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won't talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won't mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it's modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying \" Please Do Not Play Piano\". I also won't talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you'd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.   I will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock's direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entree or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer's breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don't mind a little contact.  The alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A \"powerclash\" in True form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I've frequented this location for 5 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Secret BBQ \"Chicken\" sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the Argentine Po'boy is a fine choice as well. Hands down one of my favorite places in the Valley.  Here's a Tip: don't be a dummy, add Chai to your Tsoynami.  *I have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated.",

The chili fries are a nice treat. My favorite dessert is the chocolate peanut butter bar. Drooling just thinking about it. They also sell vegan products like fake cheese, cookies, grains, etc. You don't have a server, you order at the counter, get a number and someone brings out your food. They do have a tip jar at the counter. TIP THE STAFF! They are all nice and friendly there and will help you if you're stuck figuring out what to get. I've never been disappointed. I've gone many times when I lived in Phoenix and made a point to go back on a recent visit. Will eat here every time I'm in town.  The actual place: The vibe inside is casual and low key. The walls and furniture are bright and colorful. They have booths, tables and couches (my favorite corner). Very cozy. Limited outdoor seating when the weather is nice.",

    "text": "So my doctor has put me on a mandatory 1 month vegan diet. Lucky for me Green is a vegan restaurant!   I have always wanted to try Green, but had never really had an excuse to go.   So Friday night the hubs and I make the trek across town. We arrived about 630 and it was JAM PACKED. Not a seat to be had. At Green you stand in line and place your order at the register and pay for it then. You find a seat and a waiter will come out and yell your name and then deliver your food.   We placed our order and took a table outside as that was all there was. Kinda sucked, but oh well. It did start to rain, but there was a little over hang keeping us dry.  We ordered starters. Crab Puffs and Spicy Buffalo \"wings\" Both were pretty good. The crab puffs were spot on, you really couldn't tell a difference between them and the real thing. The \"wings\" were good as well, but for sure a big difference between the real thing and the mock. But still tasty.   The hubs ordered the Original \"g\" Spicy Po-Boy, a Spicy buffalo mock chicken sammie and I got the Mum's Meatball Po-Boy. Both were really very good. The Thyme fries are really crisp and tasty, but like other reviews, you cant really taste the thyme, not sure whats up with that.   After we were done, we decided to get a couple Tsoynamis to go. I am a ice cream FREAK, so that WAS going to be my biggest challenge getting through the 1 month Vegan diet...but not anymore. OMG...The tsoynami's are AMAZING!!! I had the Deez Hazelnuts, freaken fantastic! The hubs got the Betterfinger (Greens version of a butterfinger) SO GOOD!!!!   We will be going back to green even after I am done with my 1 month stint as a vegan.",

But going to this place makes every carnivorous instinct in my body shrivel with shame. If more places like this exist, there would be no more meat-eaters in the world. I know it.  Seriously, every dish I've had here beats its non-vegetarian counterpart by several strides. The fake chicken tastes better than real chicken, especially when it's seasoned so well here.   Everything from the eggless spring rolls to the \"fake\" meat bowls and flatbread pizzas is wonderful. Top any dish with endless toppings for just $1 and finish your meal with a tsoynami dessert.  I only wish there's a place that is equally delicious in San Francisco. There probably is, but I just can't seem to find it...  -----  Distinguishing factor: This gem offers some of the best vegan dishes you will ever have. Especially in AZ.",

However, I've been wanting to try this place for a while since I'm in Phoenix every now and then for work. Glad I finally could.  My order of Red Diablo was good but inaccurately named. An entree with \"diablo\" in the title and described as being spicy with roasted eggplant and tomato should have kick...not to mention eggplant and tomato. Instead, I got lots of carrots, broccoli, and zucchini in a decidedly un-spicy sauce, and 4 small pieces of eggplant. No tomato that I could discern.  Was it good? Yes. Was it what I thought I was getting? No. Would I go back and give Green another try the next time I'm in town? Definitely.   (I also tried their green hummus - creamy and refreshing with raw garlic zing.  Sesame oil drizzle was a surprising and welcome twist.  Curry dusted pita chips were a nice accompaniment. Yummy!)",

No worries as they were quick to say, \"Come on in!\"  Prior to our arrival we didn't know if Green was a sit-down or counter service.  Upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience.  Nice and laid back. I immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats.  Patio dining is available but the far end also has a see-through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too.  Quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything.  It's so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren't.  I settled on the Mexicali Burger.  However, when I went to order I noticed the special....\"The Big Wac\".  What?!  This is what everyone has been talking about in the Green Facebook Group. You see, The Big Wac is basically the vegan version of the Big Mac.  It's not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it.  I made the quick switch, ordered the Big Wac with fries and my husband ordered the Kung Pao bowl.  Did the Big Wac live up to the rave reviews? Yes, and more! Although I admit I was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  Seriously.  My husband's meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the Big Wac too. Partnered with the yummy thin fries I had the perfect meal.  I can't wait to return to have another fantastic meal!",

My son loved his veggie burger, my husband got something which was supposed to be spicy  veggies and rice noodles, while I got curry/ coconut veggies, rice noodles and mock chicken. My husband and I were only able to tell which bowl was which by the mock chicken in mine. There was absolutely no difference in the flavor between the 2 bowls. I told the waitress that there was no flavor in either, and she just shrugged and said \"it depends on who's cooking on how it tastes.\" I told her that mine had NO  flavor, that if I closed my eyes and had a spoonful, I couldn't tell if I was eating a piece of broccoli or the mock chicken, and there was not even a hint of coconut or curry. She just said \"sorry about that\" and walked off. For $10 a bowl, it was definitely a disappointing meal.",

So, we had to look elsewhere for dinner. We were glad we found Greens and likely will be back on our next trip to the desert. The place must be close to ASU after seeing a plethora of customers that certainly looked the college part.  After reading all of these reviews on the crabcakes, we had to try them and I'm not sure what the big whoop was all about. Ours appeared to be kind of burnt and maybe that was the problem but I didn't actually care for the filling either.  Being out of towners, we weren't quite sure how the place works. So, we were actually sitting at a table for several minutes before we realized we had to order at the register.   For the entrees, we had trouble deciding and had to ask some helpful patrons while standing in line for some advice. We got the Drunken chicken and Thai Peanut. The Drunken Chicken was the better of the two dishes.",

    "text": "i haven't been here for a while because i live so far away. if i lived closer, i'd be spending more money at this establishment because it is the best vegan restaurant i've been to in phoenix.  i guess i'll start out with the most 'okay' thing i got, which was the 'po boy.' i didn't love it, but it wasn't gross...just reminded me more of 70's style vegetarian food.  i used to be vegan, and missed pizza greatly. the pizza i ate here when my tastebuds were still vegan-oriented, told me that the pizza was good, though i still haven't had vegan pizza that supasses a pizza with real cheese on it.  i ordered a salad here once, but unfotunately i can't remember what type of salad. what i can remember is that i liked it and that it tasted fresh. nothing worse than old salad greens, which this did not have.  the hummus is rich and has a nice touch of chipotle and they don't make it as gross as some other places do. i mean, when non-mediterranean/non-middle eastern restaurants make hummus, for some reason they usually go out of their way to make it as unhummus-like and unappealing as possible. this hummus isn't exactly like that found in a mediterranean restaurant, but the direction that it veers off the standard hummus path is a tasty direction, not a pointlessly nauseating one.  the buffalo wings are salty but flavorful and i love the vegan ranch dressing that comes with them. i've tried to make it at home and haven't quite figured out how they make the dressing so good. i wish there was a Green cookbook to help me out with this one.  the tsoynamis make perfect vegan junk food. just like dairy queen minus the cow ice cream or whatever dairy queen uses. i also enjoyed a chocolate peanutbutter bar here once or twice.  i wouldn't call green 'healthy', but it is tasty. the few people i've brought here (all omnivores) enjoyed it as well.",

Ambience is okay - the way I see it is I can be surrounded by snooty vegans or snooty carnivores at some fancy schmancy restaurant - either way, the two extremes seem to have the same sort of \"air\" about them. So I'm not so crazy about who I'm sharing my meal with, but if the meal is good, I am down with it. Service ain't to shabby - not the best, they seem ocassionally bothered that they have to take your order or that you're not entirely sure what you want, but when you give a person a multitude of ways to make things, you're gonna ask, is this gluten-free, is this dairy-free, etc. You'd think they'd be use to those questions by now. But overall, a definite must-try for the adventurous, and staple to my list of faves.",

More restaurants now are becoming vegetarian friendly, but there is something to be said about not having to choose between a salad and a Portobello burger, I can eat everything on the menu!   My absolute favorites are the thyme fries, Texas \"Moo-shroom\" Po-boy , and the orccietta pasta.  The food is tasty, but the atmosphere reminds me of a local dive bar.  I have only eaten in the restaurant twice; it's kind of an \"artsy\" place and not really my style.  I order takeout regularly though, the service is great and the cashier is always super friendly.  My boyfriend is a meat eater, and enjoys their food, he actually suggests it!   I recommend substituting Green for your next trip to Chili's and see what you think.

Coming from someone who loves their meat that's saying a lot! The texture is like actual chicken. If someone brought me this mock chicken and told me it was chicken I would completely believe them because it tastes so real. The first time I made the mistake of ordering the crispy tofu. Oh it was a long line but *make sure to get a menu to look at while waiting in line*. It took me longer than the long line took to decide what to get. Make it easy on yourself and order mock chicken! Also make sure you get the correct menu (grain free or not). Don't bother with the tofu or anything other than the mock chicken! I had the mock chicken in the buffalo chicken wings. Mmm mmm mm! I wish I ordered that as my main dish. I said it was better than any real chicken I had at a restaurant (I may have to go back again and try it to re-confirm this outlandish idea). On top of that I got a cup for a drink. Not only do they have the regular soda machine but they have 3 of their homemade drinks. I had their cherry soda with their green tea. Mmm mm good! The cherry soda is like nothing I've tasted. Mmm good! I got the soynami on top of that. That was actually the only disappointing thing about this restaurant. I got the ginger snap soynami but it had vanilla cookie pieces and tasted nothing like ginger snaps. The second time I went there I had the mint oreo soynami very good! Overall extremely surprising over-the-moon in flavor restaurant!",

Green is located in a small run down strip mall adjacent to Kore Bicycles on the NW corner of Scottsdale Road and McKellips.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and without knowing of Green you probably wouldn't do a second take upon passing it, however the food here is no less than amazing!    The decor is unique and fresh; 10-12 tables, a couch/lounge area, random artwork on the walls, painted quotes, lights hanging from the ceiling, and old painted car doors along one wall.  I've tried a random assortment of items from the menu and nothing has disappointed me...but by far my favorite is the BBQ 'Chicken' sandwich along with an appetizer of the spicy buffalo wings.  I believe the mock chicken Green uses is fungus based, Quorn perhaps (may not sound appetizing but it is freaking awesome).  I am not personally vegan, or even vegetarian for that matter but Green has me hooked.  I've 'forced' many of my meat eating friends to try Green and they have all become believers (if you could call sharing something so wonderful forcing).  Great prices, great dishes, unique/fun atmosphere, and great service!!!   (On one Saturday evening around 6:30 my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some Green to go, the place had a line out the door and it took about 30-45 min to get our food.  We weren't even upset about the wait, just waited patiently for our delicous order and upon arrival the server gave us two free entree tickets for our next visit and apologized.  THIS is how you keep your customers coming back for MORE!)  Love this place so much!",

For dessert, we both had a soynami.  They were huge!  And very good.  They're kinda like the Dairy Queen blizzard's but made with soy instead.  Green is also a great place to people watch.  So many different types of people came thru.  It was very interesting to see.  I definitely recommend Green.  Even if you're not vegetarian.",

So far I had one sandwich with fake chicken with BBQ that was pretty good.    However, everything else just made me want to go get chipotle.  This place just is not for me.    This place is good for vegans and non vegans that want to try it and decide for themselves, but mostly just vegans.   I will give it 3 stars for me and 4 for the vegans, according to a lot of the veggie mites its one of the best places to go.  Recommendation: Vegans and people who like soy ice cream, but nothing to go out of your way to get.",

    "text": "OK so this is my first review in a very long time, but I just can't keep quiet any longer. My husband is a big yelper but sometimes he does not tell the whole \"truth\".  So the other night, my Husband decided we should try something totally different and go \"Green\". I love trying new places, I was down for the challenge. As usual, I went onto to YELP and looked at reviews. They were pretty positive, so it was a go.  Well first of all I think people are just not honest. The ONLY reason to go to this restautant is if you are a vegan otherwise stay away.   First of all, we walk in and it is chaos. A nice sign indicating please seat yourself or order at counter would be very helpful. So we look over the menu. I have to admit the idea of \"mock\" meat just does not sound good.  Now don't get me wrong I go vegetarian all the time at restaurants. I have to admit that Chelsea's Kitchen makes an excellent black bean burger. Anyways, we start off with mock chicken wings, I would be lieing if I did not tell you I think I might have vomited a little in my mouth. So gross.   Next, we try some artichoke dip, that was actually good because it was semi normal. I order the veggie burger. I have eaten plenty of boca burgers in  my day, but this was just gross. WHen I order a veggie burger I don't need it to look like an actual burger patty. It was pink inside. Again, I could not even eat it, I thought I was going to be sick. If I wanted to get an actual burger, I would have gone to LGO and gotten a burger.  Needless to say, I will not be going back. Just riddle me this, if you don't eat me then why do you insist in making your food appear as meat??? I don't like tuna fish, and the last thing I would want is my steak to look and smell like tuna fish!!",

Either my expectations were too high or Green just doesn't suit me...    The location is a lttle hidden but after driving up and down Scottsdale Road only twice we located it at the end of the strip mall.    Walking in the word that came to mind was \"kitschy.\"  Cute, creative and not over the top.  Smelled good!  Staff was OK... We were both hesitant with the menu since neither of us had previously been there before and the girl behind the counter seemed to be a little impatient... certainly not rude but just not overly helpful.  I had the buffalo \"chicken\" po boy and the tyme fries.  It was OK... nothing fabulous.  Very messy... (who puts halfed cherry tomatoes on a sandwich???? they're just gonna pop out when you eat it!)  Apparently the cook had no time to add the tyme on the fries or salt for that matter... they were crispy and hot though so that's a plus.    My friend had the mexicali burger and coleslaw.  The burger had good flavor but way mushy and it was just the patty, sauce and bread... could definitely been improved by some lettuce to add a little crunch.  The slaw was bland... but once she added a little siracha to it was much better!     We did share a oatmeal cookie sandwhich which was very yummy.  I am curious about some of the other menu items so I will try it again.... just won't rush out to do it...",

I had the BBQ Po-Boy and it was awesome.  I'm still trying to figure out what was in this sandwich.  It looked like pork.  It tasted like pork.  But it wasn't pork!  This is killing me!  The pasta salad on the side was also really good with just the right amout of curry seasoning.  If all vegetarian food was this good, we'd see a lot more vegetarians and lot less spare tires.",

Tucked away in the corner of a very inauspicious strip mall off Scottsdale Road I can't say I was excited as I walked up to the front door. Luckily that all changes when you walk in where you are greeted with a vibrant atmosphere, really friendly staff and fantastic photographs adorning the walls.  I had a spicy bean burger with to die for thyme fries and I could have eaten the meal twice it was so good. Fresh and tasty is how I would best describe my food and my companions choice too.   I was stuck in a bit of an East Valley rut last year going to the same old favorites but now I can add this terrific little restaurant to my list of regular haunts and I couldn't be happier about it.

The service is always friendly and outstanding, which goes miles with me...but add to that such a great, unique and tasty menu that non-vegetarians like me are swayed to eat veg. I mean, vegan po' boys, kung pao, coconut curry, garden burgers, meatball sandwiches--all of which are tastier than the so-called \"real things\". I had the spicy bbq chicken sandwich with a side of curry pasta salad today, which rocked, and with a friend who hadn't been in yet, and who, I'm sure, will be back. May I also suggest the thyme fries, which are a bit of awesome. I don't care about the so-called \"scenesters\" that one reviewer was complaining about. I like that they replaced the standard soda fountain with a lineup of kombucha, Izze, and other healthy drinks. I just eat happily and enjoy myself here, and notice that everyone else is generally doing exactly the same.  Go Green!",

My hubster and I were visiting his mom for the first time since she had moved to Phoenix and admittedly, neither of us were too stoked on the visit. We totally wanted to see her but as for Phoenix?? Anyways... she knew what she was doing by taking us straight from the airport to Green.   I LOVED EVERYTHING. From our appetizers (hummus + fries) to my entree- I had the chicken curry noodle bowl, to my beverage- a suicide mixture of their house green tea and house limeade (YUM) to my soy ice cream treat (I had the mint with paul newman oreos!) which I scarfed down after being totally stuffed. This place is ridiculously good. And reasonably priced. And fresh. And not stuffy or pretentious in anyway. Basically, this would be our new steady if we lived anywhere near... Tempe. Which fortunately we do not, but I have to say, you Arizonians sure are stoked to have a place like Green. And now we have a reason to look forward to returning to AZ!! :D",

I had fresh fruit.  I have gone vegetarian two times.  Each time lasted about a year.  I just like the feeling of eating good food and not ending up a bloated beached whale.  Even after I shared a Chocolate Monsoon Soynami for dessert I could still walk out the door feeling good about what I put into my body.  The Soynamies rock by the way.  If a DQ Blizzard and a Soynami got in a taste test fight the Soynami would kick ass and take no prisoners.  Check out Green, even if you eat meat.  The food is excellent and good for you.  Go eat.",

That being said, Green is one of the place that I go to whenever I can't think of anything that I want to eat in particular. Green should be synonymous with Tasty since all their foods are very good.  I don't care if they are Vegetarian or Vegan, tasty is still tasty, meat or no meat.  Good quality vegetarian foods are not cheap and Green is pretty reasonable with their offering.  They have one of the best mock-meats that I've ever eaten and fresh veggies abound.  I can eat their Vegan Chili Fries by the bucket and still feel good after (tips : add some Sriracha to the ketchup to add more punch to the fries).     So put off your doubts and reservation and give Green a try. Maybe you will find out like me that sometimes eating Green is a good alternatives to Pork Bellies (note to self : need to roast some pork bellies !)",

Note: I am not vegetarian or vegan or anything else.  The food here is just fantastic. I actually really love fake chicken and beef and contrary to what most omnivores think - this vegetarian food is neither bland nor tasteless. Actually it's the opposite, the curry and thai dishes are to die for.   If you've never been here you're missing out. If you're not a vegetarian, I hope you'll give it a chance anyways, you may find that you like it better than some meat based dishes at other restaurants. Oh, and don't forget to try a Tsoynami while you're there, it's a soy milkshake with real fruit. Mango is my favorite.",

The setup is absolutely adorable with the denim insulation and the VW hubcaps and car doors.  And the menu layout for all the tsoynamis is equally cute.  My friend and I got the wings to start, the red diablo, and the kung pao bowl.  The wings were really good, and I love the dipping sauce they came with!  I was in heaven with my red diablo bowl.  I loved the consistency of the mock chicken and the eggplant had been soaked in sauce for a while so it was completely mushy, just the way I like it!  I completely polished off my bowl, and my friend did the same.  Yet he was still craving the tsoynami since the guy at the counter gave us a free sample.  After going through all of our options, at which point he decided we would never be friends again because I don't like coffee, rootbeer, or mint, we decided on the rocky road tsoynami.  These things are huge and perfect to split with someone for an after dinner treat.  They definitely do not skimp on the toppings.  This place is perfect to get some flavorful vegetarian in, and it's served at a pretty good price.  I definitely have to come back and check out the salads.",

Spicy yet not overpowering and the tofu lived up to its description.   The wife got a jerk salad that was also very tasty. The servings are quite good for the price and the atmosphere is excellent. Good for people watching. Green reminds me more of a restaurant from Seattle or Portland, which is a nice touch in this never-ending drive of TGI McFunsters.",

The space was welcoming with the VW car doors & various parts + poetic justice painted upon the wall, the mini-market shelf & cooler grocery items also just a straight-up love fest for me.   I also had some crazy good tasy coffee beverage that carried me all the way back to Chicago.   Happy people go here, you can see it on their faces, and the staff - super-duper friendly to out of towners like myself, offering up words of wisdom on the area for my next visit.   The place is hard to find in a tiny strip mall in the corner, next door to the Salvation Army and a fantastic bike shop.   Happy visitor made happier by GREEN.",

I adore the po-boy sandwiches with the curry pasta on the side. Id say skip the imitation crab puffs, not bad but too many others dishes that top it. I only wish you guys were open later and on Sundays. I have drove down there 4 different occasions on Sunday only to be reminded that you are not open. Then I have to go to old town Scottsdale and waste the day looking at kokopelli art and cowboy stores. Which is always fun, but still i want my Green! Also, whenever I have tried to go on Friday or Saturday its packed and hard to get a table. So again its old town Scottsdale time. So my suggestion to you Green, longer hours, more locations, open Sundays. Some booze would be cool to even if it was a few select bottled beers. But I do enjoy the array of sodas and teas in the cooler! Keep on a rockin' my tummy! :)",

I went here with my girlfriend and her pescetarian mom and I admit that I was a little iffy at first, but is was soooo gooood!  Meat fans, seriously give this place a shot. I'm saying this as a person who would wear a bacon strap wristwatch if someone invented one. They have things like Big Macs, wings, noodle dishes, just so many different kinds of food but there is no meat--just very close imitations of meat. You'll be able to get the savory taste of what you are craving and not feel like you're in a food coma afterwards. Whether you're into spicy food, basic foods, they have a great selection as well as a fridge full of many different types of sodas and drinks that are out of the norm.   I love the decor and the layout of the restaurant, but the location is a bit strange and some of the employees (repeat: SOME of the employees) are straight up arrogant. Being a restaurant like Green in a state like Arizona is a tough feat, so the staff should be more welcoming and not as smug. The person who ran our food was very friendly, however. She had cool tattoos running up her arms and a huge smile on her face--she basically saved the day as far as service goes.  Again--meat lovers--you don't even have to step outside of your box to enjoy Green--order the wings or burger you want and enjoy (warning: you may have flatulence afterwards).",

We ordered the bowls, one with noddles and the other with brown rice and both were full of flavor and did not taste like what you would normally expect out of a vegetarian restaurant...it didn't tasty \"healthy\", it tasted good. We also got the spicy edamame.  Love the taste and the flavor, only flaw is the price point. I would come here again, but if the price was $2 dollars less on each item, I would come here at least once a week.",

My point is, after she ate here once she's been pestering me to take her back for the last year. So if it's good enough for my mom, it should be good enough for you. Unless you think you're better than my mom. Well, there's a good chance you are. But my point stands.",

Next time I will probably order take out.   Artichoke Gratine. Remember that. Cheesy and creamy and just a touch spicy. The crab puffs were also a huge hit. I wouldn't have known the difference between the real thing and this dish.  The majority of people in the restaurant were eating a yummy-looking milkshake/sundae concoction, but I never found out what it was. Next time I come back, I'll have to try one.",

And for you usual meat lovers, I recommend the argentine po-boy. You won;t even notice there isn't meat in it. Trust me.  And save room for a soy-nami. Lots of room, these things are massive.

I went with a coworker during our lunch break and since they open at 11am we got there shortly after they opened. I had \"Thee Argentine\" with thyme fries and she had the \"The Green Burger\"; my sandwich was unbelievably good, strips of seitan mock steak sauteed with caramelized peppers  and onions, vegan mayo and a spicy chimichuri sauce, all on a scrumptious sub roll.  My friend loved her burger she said you could not tell it was meatless. We both got Tsoynami's  her choice was \"The Fruits\" where you pick the ones you want, and I got \"Deez Hazelnuts\" mine was heavenly. My total for the sandwich , fries and dessert was $13.50 not bad for a tasty,filling healthy meal. I went back and had the Original \"g\" Spicy Po-Boy made with spicy buffalo mock chicken, lettuce, tomato and  vegan mayo. This place rocks and it is always packed that is a good thing cause I need them to stay in business.",

    "text": "Since coming here for the first time in July, I have visited green vegetarian 3 more times. I have gotten the chicken nuggets, blonde alfredo, macaroni and cheese, and the BBBQ bacon burger.   I got the blonde alfredo with the mock chicken. I was not expecting the pieces of \"chicken\" to be breaded and fried. I was expecting it to be more like grilled chicken. They didn't really belong in a dish with a cream sauce.  Speaking of the blonde alfredo sauce, it's very good! Tastes very similar to the real thing. I will definitely be getting this wonderful dish again but I will probably get plain tofu or no \"meat\" on it at all.  For the Mac and Cheez it was lacking in flavor and the cheese was not melted enough.  The BBBQ bacon burger had a bit too much mayo and barbecue sauce on it. The tempeh bacon was okay, but nothing like actual bacon. It was too thick and did not really have the flavor of bacon. The sauteed portabella mushrooms and caramelized onions were the best part of the burger, along with the sesame seed bun!  The chicken nuggz had the flavor and texture of real chicken nuggets! The barbecue sauce and ranch dressing it comes with are also wonderful. These would definitely fool your kids. ;)  The blonde alfredo and drunken mongolian probably tie for my favorite meal at green vegetarian.  To wrap up my review, this is my favorite restaurant in the area! I love green vegetarian so much.",

How amazing and delicious it is. I almost felt like I was cheating. Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian this place is amazing, the food the environment is so hipster and cute. I went in on a Friday afternoon and since it was my first time I didn't realize how many others have found out about his place, I waited in line for a while but didn't mind because the atmosphere is so cute and everyone around was so happy and nice.

We had a Argentinean po boy which was basically mock steak peppers and onions. The mock beef as great,  the veggies were a bit over cooked and the bun was toasted but nothing special for $8.  We did start with the egg rolls, aside from the small noodles inside they were decent as they were fried but not greasy but again nothing special. $4  We also split a \"diablo red\" bowl $7.50 despite the name we had to add some hot sauce to up the level of diablo to it. The veggies were fresh and well cooked, the mock chicken was great and the brown rice served it's purpose well.    Overall I like the format of this place, and the fact I can order anything on the menu.",

    "text": "First off, I am not Vegan....not even slightly. I love myself a good slice of fish or some wholesome chicken like the next guy. However, I have shifted my lifestyle choices recently to a more healthy overall track. So keep that in mind when reading forward.  Green is the first \"mock\" food joint I have ever eaten at. Considering the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I took my fiance over here to check it out. We both were cautiously optimistic about the abundance of options on the menu. Laura (my fiance) chose a mock meatball spaghetti, the Orecciette pasta. The mock meatballs tasted more like falafel than meat, however the sauce and earlobe pasta was amazing. Also added in were the veggies within the pasta....overall she really chose an awesome dish.  I chose the seemingly popular Original \"g\" spicy po-boy sandwich, with curry pasta. Biting into the mock chicken, you could tell it was not real chicken per say..its obvious. BUT, the amazingly tasty flavors along with the buffalo sauce just run rampantly on your taste buds. The curry pasta I got as my side was as good, if not better than the sandwich itself...I could eat that curry pasta all day.  So, with that said, two dishes tried, both tasted AMAZING. You can tell the food is not real, but does it matter when the food tastes so great? I'll answer that for you with a resounding no...no it doesn't matter. It gets 5 stars just for the fact that the culinary experience may be different, but the end result is significant satisfaction on multiple levels. Think about it:  its great for you, the soy products within are amazingly healthy and everything is organic for the most part when you eat here. I will definitely be making plans to set aside a few $'s just for a \"Green Fund\" so I can eat here at least a couple times a month. Will re-post when I try something else...perhaps the pizza??? Will update soon!!!",

    "text": "I have been to Green many times and didn't write a review, but they have been helpful for me so I wanted to make sure to help others.  First of all, this restaurant is 100 percent vegan (although it's called Green Vegetarian).  I don't go to green when I want to have a salad or cold sandwich because I can make that at home.  This place serves delicious comfort food.  By comfort, I don't mean greasy or fattening, but don't go here if you're calorie conscious.  This is a great place to take friends and family who are not vegan or vegetarian because the food tastes so \"normal.\"  Green has the best mock chicken and mock beef I have ever had anywhere in the country (so far).  All of the sandwiches/burgers are to die for.  The thyme fries are great but if you want to keep it on the healthier side, go for the tahini coleslaw as a side option--it may be my favorite dish at Green.  Before I was vegan--more than five years ago--I didn't care for chicken wings but after years of watching other people scarf tens at a time, I grew a desire for them.  I have ordered them in bulk and meat lovers cannot taste the difference.  They are delicious and served with cucumber ranch and veggies.  I think I misspoke when I said the tahini slaw was my fave because I think this one might be it.  I've had the samosas and couldn't tell you anything good (or bad) about them.  They just left me with no impression.  The bowls are good but simple.  I feel like I can get similar dishes at other places so I would rather have something more exciting.  But if you're in the mood for something like that with the delicious mock meats, go for one of these.   I usually go to Green for its specials, which are posted on Facebook. They've been some of my favorite dishes and are usually delicious!   I have yet to try a dessert because I'm always full when I leave but make sure to try one of the tsoynamis.  They are light and a perfect end to a great meal.  I always get the almond oy vey and substitute the chocolate with bananas. Nom.  This is the best vegan or vegetarian restaurant in the greater Phoenix are.  I would highly recommend going there whether you are vegetarian/vegan or not.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Buffalo Wings: For me, this was the standout. SO GOOD. Indeed it was so good that I actually had to make sure I didn't eat too many and not leave any. I don't want to be the hog when sharing a dish after all. The wings are like small little nuggets covered in buffalo sauce that tastes legit. I wish I had some right now!  Kung Pao Noodles: Huge disappointment for me. Lacked flavor, spice, or anything to redeem it. I'm begging you to try something else and trust me on this one. It will not fill that \"I am craving Asian food\" void you might be feeling. It won't even fill that \"I would like something with flavor\" void. Harsh, but True.  The meatball sammy looked amazing, and the side fries were VERY good. I like the smaller fries that pack just the right crispy. I totally wish I would have ordered that dish!  I shared one of the ice cream things. I didn't really find myself being blown away but it is what it is. If you can only have soy then it might hit your sweet spot.  Overall its a solid spot, and I would try some other dishes. However it isn't so good that I'm dreaming of it here in SD...well ok, maybe those wings.........",

I like the parking availability better more at this one, but the inside decor of the other location better. For lunch, I ordered the Big Wac on a GF bun. I was told the patties aren't completely GF. Since high doses of wheat are more a problem for me, I gave it a shot. Truth be told, it was the authentic flavor of a \"Big *ac\" from the other guys, but the texture was a bit off and the GF bun was SUPER HEAVY on my tummy :/ I ended up eating the second half of the burger with no bun. It came with fries (or I got it with fries, can't remember the menu layout) and they were scrumptious! The staff was super friendly and accommodating as I asked my customary handful of questions! Go there to check out the fun menu!  This visit was on 4/20/13.",

Edamame with seasalt and squeeze of lime  2. Artichoke Gratin - Very easy, tasty and flavorful 3. Green Hummus - Yummy! 4. Eggless Rolls - Not a fan. :( 5. Samosas - Good. Similar to indian restaurants 6. Jerk Tofu Salad - Very healthy even without the faux meat or tofu 7. Spicy Peanut Salad - Very tasty 8.Drunken Mushroom Noodle Bowl - I always order this 9.Singapore Tofu Noodle Bowl  - Same here 10. Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl - My ex-roommate is addicted to this. He likes it with fried tofu. 11. Coconut Curry Bowl - Yum! 12. Diablo Red Bowl - Delish! 13. Crab Puffs.  14. Mum's Meatball Po-Boy - It was okay. :) 15. Argentine Po-Boy - Delicious 16.

Simple fresh herbs would go a long way.  Positive is the take out is on time and the vegan \"blizzards\" are yummy.",

Tried a few new dishes this week including the mexicali burger, the artichoke gratin, the buffalo wings, and three flavors of tsoynamis.  All were so good.  The wings were delicious and amazingly \"real\" in texture and taste.  The tsoynamis are freakin' awesome - the first one I had a few years ago, I didn't really think the texture was quite right.  But I definitely think its exactly like a blizzard but with better flavors, like fluffer-nutter (pb, banana, marshmallow fluff. yum)  But nothing beats the old standby of a no harm chicken parm with chili fries on the side.  The fries are the best fries ever, and the chili is so good.  The no harm parm sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it.    Like I said before, if they opened up in my neck of the woods, I could totally be vegan.",

Service was friendly and efficient. _______________  Update:  12/10/07 - What's the first thing I do when I arrive in Phoenix? Punch in 2240 N. Scottsdale Road in my GPS and head to Green! This time around I had Thee Argentine Po-Boy with fried - Mock steak fried with onions and peppers, vegan mayo and a spicy sauce. I couldn't get enough! Very delicious  12/11/07 - After having a veggie burger and fries for lunch at a Hard Rock Cafe, I thought I'd balance it out by having something healthy for dinner - I ordered the Diablo Rice bowl with chicken and brown rice. The description looked good: veggies in a spicy sauce - but it was a little too salty for my taste and didn't finish it. Oh well, can't win them all.  12/12/07 - I was working close by, so decided to run in for lunch. I ordered the No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich with a side of tahini coleslaw. It was a little bit messy to eat by hand, with the tomato sauce and soy mozzarella oozing everywhere - still good nonetheless. The coleslaw was a nice compliment to the sandwich.  12/14/07 - I'll miss you Green!",

I am not a Vegetarian and I always get a little wary about places that are solely vegetarian, but I had looked at the Yelp reviews on this place, and it was within walking distance of my hotel, so I decided to give it a try.  I was definitely not disappointed. The place is very welcoming in an ethereal sort of way. It is a mostly college crowd predictably but there were other in the restaurant as well. I spoke with the young lady (her name escapes me now) at the counter who was very friendly and knowledgeable. I told her truthfully that I was not a vegetarian and did she have any suggestions. At her direction, I tried the crab puffs and the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken. I walked it back to my hotel.  All I can say is.....WOW! The mock chicken tasted like..... well,..... CHICKEN! Great chicken actually. I don't really go for straight tofu and the vegetarian god who prepared this must have known it. I did not miss the chicken. The Thai peanut bowl was quite spicy and delicious. The crab puffs were very good, a little greasy, and not as good as the real thing, but well worth it, and if I am here again I will probably have them again. Way to go! If many vegetarian restaurants are this good, then Jeff might have to rethink his avoidance of these places.",

    "text": "Here is the equation for this review:   +5 stars for Tsoynamis:: So appropriately named: These things seriously pack the gale-force taste to knock your tongue-hut off of its timbers. Fun hand-mixed flavours to choose (Rocky Road -choc chips, choc syrup, walnuts, marshmallow...PB&J -peanut butter, grahams, strawberries...Almond Joy, S'mores, Don Quixote, and a Choco-Coffee Creation) or build your own...all with a base of their fantastic soft serve -*vegan* soft serve. True. These things are about 16oz...and a little natural disaster in a glass, so I recommend sharing if you are not plan to make it your meal. 3 words: Tsoynami for breakfast.   -2 stars for pizza and sandwiches:: These were just dissapointing. The Texas po'boy with portabello in their Espresso BBQ sauce sounded unique and delicious, but it was really a let down. The BBQ sauce was altogether too sweet. The peppers were sauteed to a point of sadness, and they just contributed even MORE sweetness to the dish. Really missed the BBQ mark (I am a 'que sauce executive, by the by). The hot-wing po'boy, however, seemed to have stolen ALL of the flavour and spice from the Texas. *Very* hot (I enjoy heat, so it was fine for me, but I caution more sensitive buds), and too greasy for my taste.  But the pizza was the BIG misfire. I had heard good things about the type of vegan cheese they use, so I definitely wanted to try that while we were in town. My mistake. I just have to face it. I am NOT into the melty-cheese thing (all of you dairy-dos are rolling your eyes...yes, I get it, the big 'duh' for the vegan girl). Horrible texture, taste and ALL too much of it. (Omni-mum agreed). Even scraping it off, the taste lingered. The sauce was nice, but the mushrooms and onions, again, were too oily, and the veggeroni was just store-bought yuck. (I was hoping for some home-made-less-processed seitan or something). The crust was just a thin flat-bread, which I do not like for pizza. The sauce was tasty...but too thinly spread (and affected by the yuck cheese).   +1 star for free fresh fruit substitute:: Seriously, how many times do you have to give a kidney in order to get some fruit or veggies subbed for a side? Thank you, Green, for being reasonable.  So, do the math and you have 4 stars. Seriously, the Tsoynamis did all of the work on that one. I am tempted to advise Green to just shut down the food side and roll out the Tsoynamis non-stop. However, my mum really liked the fries.   Next time we are in Phoenix, we will definitely go to Green again, but only for Tsoynamis...and maybe fries. I recommend you do the same.",

But i like green for the effort, tastes, and ambiance.  The variety is pretty good ranging from salads, pizzas, burgers, \"po-boys\" and noodles.  This time i had the Mexicali burger and my lady friend had the spicy peanut sause noodles (with is pretty much like a Thai noodle bowl, with mock-chicken).  The burger was sup-par.  the patty was more of a ground meat texture than a patty so it broke apart easily.  The flavor wasnt really there and it took ketchup and siracha sauce to bring it up.  The fries however very very good.  Thin cut, light and crispy.  Definitely a highlight of that meal.  as for the Thai noodles, it was pretty good too. The mock chicken was very good. not too dry and had a good texture to it...dare i say almost like chicken.  My only complaint is the price.  You really dont get for what you pay for.  the portions  are a lil small and the tofu/mock meat are far and few in between.  but still relatively inexpensive to eat, all entrees are about $10.  but we could get a lil more fries, or noodles or vegies for that much.  another complaint was didnt save enough room for the tsoynami ice creams they looked absolutely delish.  next time... next time  Pros -only vegan in town -flavorful with a good selection of dishes -cute decor  Cons: -meals a lil small for $10, but not that bad.",

The staff was really friendly and helped me pick out the green burger (that is really red) with vegan cheese. I LOVED it. I have really never had a vegan burger that tasted that good. And the fries are to die for, the best I have ever had also. Which is saying a lot..because I like french fries.   They lean more towards the \"comfort food\" than healthful choices, but even vegans need their comfort food sometimes.   The decor was unique and really pleasant. One of the walls was decorated with car doors and it looked like all the tables and plates and such were from ikea.   I know that they sometimes have live music there but I have never gotten a change to catch it.   I would recommend everyone try this little place. Even if you eat meat you will love it, at least that is what all my carnivore friends say.",

    "text": "The place has a nice little vibe going on and they have some unique items but the reason the rating is so low is that there really aren't a lot of options that don't involve faux meat.  Aren't these people vegan?  Don't they hate the idea of poor little animals being our food (even though that is the only reason they are alive)?  Then why so much FAKE MEAT?!    I will never understand the meat envy vegans and vegetarians have.  I go to a place like this to get a dish that uses vegetables in more creative ways, not to get some overly processed soy products that aren't nearly as healthy as fresh lean meats like chicken and fish.  FYI, I love meat but every once in a while I like to grab a vegetarian dish.    Another negative is nearly everything is fried.  Guess they bust the myth that people are vegan because it is healthier.  Frying things is the cheap way out of actually creating a healthy AND tasty meal.    I'll give them a 2.5 star because what we chose was quite tasty.  But with nearly every option involving faux meat and tofu it really is a disappointment.  If you want legitimate vegan fare try out some indian places or Ethiopian places.  They are very creative and using spices to flavor a vegetable dish. The fake cheeses and meats are for Vegans with meat envy, not for Omnivores that just want a good meal.  Keep your expectations in check and you should be okay.",

The menu seems like there are a lot of options but what they do really well are their bowls and their sandwiches. We had their Diablo Red bowl - a spicy veggie and rice creation we got with 'chicken,' and the pasta with 'meatballs.' We also split the 'wings.' They totally have their mock meats down. I was most surprised by the meatballs which were tender and flavorful with a near perfect texture. Their bowl sizing is perfect, I could eat more but that's probably about as much as I should have.   The next time we had the 'green burger,' a house-made veggie burger with oats that's actually red in color. It inspired me to start Googling around for how to make something similar because it was such a fresh take on a veggie burger. He had another bowl- the curry with 'chicken' which was fantastic.   This is the best overall vegan place I've tried in a long while, it nails the balance between creative and attainable where all feel welcome.    I hope they eventually slide into a more cozy atmosphere. It's not awful, but I can't see its dinner business growing in its current location.",

I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad.

Their fries were far superior to many traditional burger joints'. But... they're still FRENCH FRIES, people. The jerk tofu salad was impressively spicy, but laden in too-many FRIED won ton strips and chunks of FRIED tofu. Do you see the theme? No wonder my SO nodded enthusiastically throughout the whole meal and offered to come back any time.   I had the G po-boy, buffalo \"chicken\" on a big spongy roll, dripping and oozing in spicy sauce and vegan mayo. The fake meat they use is really, really, really authentic. Like, so authentic, I'm not going to get it next time because I really don't like meat in the first place, hence my vegetarianism. Stringy fibers in my fake chicken grosses me out as much as the stringy fibers in real chicken. The sandwich was tasty -- the bread surprisingly excellent -- but greasy.   So yeah. Two hesitant thumbs up. I'll definitely go again, although I'll have to dig a little deeper on the menu to find something not quite so artery hardening.",

After we ate, my sister said she thought she could kill a vampire with her breath because it was so garlicky.

A lot of water and the ranch sauce from our wings helped to curb the spice. There is plenty of seating inside and outside, and the bathrooms are clean and gender neutral. There are also many vegan products for sale such as cookie dough, marshmallow fluff, and chocolate syrup. Truly a vegan paradise.",

It is the glorious Big Wac (with extra Wac sauce).    I have made the pilgrimage to both Green locations for several years now, and the Big Wac is always amazing and still has yet to be beat.    And for you McDonald's lovers, my friend says this burger tastes like a real Big Mac (I've never had one in my life, so I can't confirm).  So just try it.

The employee who was helping me suggested some of her favorites, and when I said that I was in the mood for one of the sandwiches, she highly recommended the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy with their gluten-free bun and suggested the sweet potato puffs as the side.  I'm SO GLAD I went with those suggestions because holy moly, both the sandwich and the sweet potato puffs were absolutely delicious! The Po-Boy had gluten-free mock \"chicken\" that was very tender and not chewy, smothered in a delicious moderately spicy Buffalo sauce and a little bit of vegan mayonnaise.  And then those sweet potato puffs! Think sweet potato tater tots but fluffier on the inside, and the outside had a nice, thin, crispy crust. A perfect combination of textures. Each one was like a little nugget of heaven in my mouth.  I just wish my stay in Phoenix was longer so that I could have come back and tried one of their many other yummy-sounding gluten-free options, especially the other sandwiches on their menu! But I guess I'll just have to come back next time I'm in town!",

I spent almost 30 minutes trying to find something.   Well I did, it was a chicken mock with BBQ, caramelized peppers and onions, I added avocado and it was on a soft roll.   I added side of grilled Brussels sprouts, they were crisp still, a little over seasoned.  They would have been better softer, less seasoning.. I enjoyed house made lime drink, and then soft served nice cream.   Overall, place was well worth my stop, prices are fair.   Its also a very busy place.   Every few minutes 2-3 more cars pull up and I see the parking lot full with I think all of your customers.   Line to order was not a long wait, 2-3 mins each time i went up to counter.

    "text": "\"I couldn't help it. I can resist everything except temptation.\"   - Oscar Wilde  After consuming a small salad for lunch at home, Linh L. and I made the decision to try out Green's Tsoynamis around 3PM.  Being part of the 80% of Asians that are lactose-intolerant, I've been wanting to try out their decadent \"tsoft tserve\" soy-based ice cream.  A short car ride later, we sauntered into Green, the Garden of Eden, and were instantly tempted by the forbidden fruit in the form of a delicious aroma.  I was suddenly hungry and something warm was all too tempting.  \"Would you like to see our menu?\" asked the hipster-looking cashier.  Yes, Eve.  I would like to see the menu.  Also, I swear you were in the art program at ASU with Linh and me...  Weird.  Even though I really have been wanting to try Green's Tsoynamis since I first stumbled upon a picture of it on Instagram, I've been creeping on their online menu.  Naturally, I got the Thai Peanut with house tofu.  While it has great flavor and the sauce coats the broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and fried tofu well, it sadly didn't have a strong peanut sauce flavor.  I suppose I went into it hoping it will taste like Thailicious' peanut sauce salad dressing but that was my fault.  It was still delicious on the organic brown rice and I was full without feeling heavy and gross.  I love clean eats!  Linh had their special \"RocknRolled Tacos\" with Seitan chicken.  He liked it.  Although we were both full and satisfied from our impromptu late-lunch, we decided to splurge and get dessert.  TSOYNAMIS FOR DAYS!  My banana cream pie tsoynami was delicious.  Linh's Dough Boy was also pretty darn good.  It had giant chunks of cookie dough that made my skirt flip [not literally, unlike my time at Fired Pie].  I sat cross-legged in the booth merrily eating my lactose-free dessert while staring at the artwork, the car doors lining the wall, and all the artsy hipster customers and I was happy.  Outside the rain began to fall.  We came, we dined, and we gave in to the temptation that is Green.  Linh even left with a spumoni cupcake.  You guys are good.  You guys are real good.  \"When women go wrong, men go right after them.\"  - Mae West  I think Mae was talking about Green and me.  My wallet is feeling lighter and all is right with the world.  I'll be back.",

I know nami has a free standing location but Green is close to where I live and the people there are always so nice! All I have to say is that if you've never had tsoynami, you have to try it. It's dairy free, and sooooooooo good. I'm not technically dairy free, but I do try to limit my intake of it - which is why nami is perfect! I'm a HUGE ice cream lover and would choose nami over any other frozen treat... it's that good! You choose your base (vanilla, chocolate, or swirl) and then choose what goes in it. They have many creations available on their menu. My go-to is vanilla banana cream pie, add peanut butter. I've been coming here for about 3 years now and it never gets old!",

My fiance first drove me 35 minutes to Nami (their bakery Nextdoor to the phx location) to buy their Valentine's Strawberries and truffles. I was disappointed to find out that the Chicken and Waffles was not offered at Green Phoenix, only Scottsdale. My fiance loves me so much that he drove me another 35 minutes clear across the other side of town (in the rain) so that I could have Chicken and Waffles as I had been dying to have this dish. We arrived at Green in Tempe (finally) and for the first time I didn't even have to look at the menu. Went straight to the register and placed my order only to be told unapologetically \"oh, that's not ready yet.\"  We were perplexed as their advertisements clearly stated Valentine's Day at the Tempe Location. I even called the Phoenix location and verified. Let the guy at Nami (their bakery next door) know we were heading there, too. No one ever said this dish would not be available until later. Heck, even the guy at the counter in Scottsdale didn't even know when it would be ready. He said 3:00, maybe 4:00, we don't really know.  And he frankly did not care that we just drove clear across town for this dish that they advertised. He simply said sorry and bye. Worst customer service ever.",

We got one of everything so everyone could try a little of everything. They left really impressed and wanting to come back! If that's not success I don't know what is. I come here regularly. Everything is amazing the food, service and location! I like this location best because it feels more like a conventional restaurant. Their other location is great just a lot less places to sit. No complaints here. I will keep coming back!  Thank you guys for everything! Its always an interesting and fun place to eat!",

If you are trying to get your friends to consider adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet, take them here. 100% plant based takes on American classics , the Big Wac replicated the flavor of a Big Mac down to the pickles, chopped onions, and 1000 island sauce , all without the guilt and stomach ache that comes from a meal at Mickey Ds. My food came out amazingly fast, the service and atmosphere was phenomenal, and the prices are more than fair. Can't wait to go back and devour the entire menu, I only wish there was more parking.",

My grandmother and mother were preparing dishes long before any restaurants served vegetarian dishes, much less fully vegetarian.    After reading the previous reviews, I had to try the Big Wac.  I was very impressed with the size and the taste of the burger.  It was a little salty for my taste but that kind of goes along with veggie dishes these days.  The other burger without the \"special sauce\" would probably be much more toward my taste.    The slaw was excellent side dish.  I could've eaten a plate full of it on its own.    The tables and booths are a little tired and could use replaced.  Parking is plentiful.  The people there were VERY friendly.    I can't wait to check a few other items next visit!",

    "text": "Well, that was pretty great. I've been to my share of vegan restaurants in my life having been vegetarian for 27 years and this one is definitely among the best.   It has a cool, hippie-hipster vibe that makes you wonder if you're in Seattle or Humboldt instead. Being a lover of all things PEACE, LOVE, and HAPPINESS, this place is totally my jam.  It's an order-at-the-counter place or what we all kind of dub as \"fast casual\" or whatever. You grab a drink from the case, some vegan cookie dough for later and order your food. They hand you a number and deliver to your table. They don't have fountain soda, but awesome, homemade juices that take the place. You can buy sodas though, just fancier ones in the bottle cooler case.  We had a variety of things--mock orange chicken with veggies and rice (good), egg rolls (a bit bland but fixed that with sriracha--would've been better stuffed with more crunchy veggies and glass noodles), thyme fries (yum), veggie burger (decent, topped with high quality stuff) and the favorite, fried Brussels Sprouts with lime. It was alllllll about those Brussels, people.   I am dreaming of those, honestly. I could eat a whole dinner of just those. Mmmmm.  Definitely see the appeal and for those crispy little mini cabbages, I'd come again and again.",

The Ancient grain Benny was amazing, and their Sweet Potato pancakes with maple syrup and ginger butter were incredibly delicious! My husband ordered an omelet where he got to choose what he wanted in it. It was cooked to perfection...fluffy with lots of creamy cheese melted inside. The coffee was good as was the cappuccino.  This place is worth waking up early for...but as their name suggests - snooze your morning away and eat breakfast at 2pm like we did!!!",

Now I am quite sure that I would really like this location as well but unfortunately today must have been an off day..  This is my first time and last time visiting this location in Tempe.  I placed my order online for my family and arrived in a timely manner.  I stood in line, bought a couple bottled drinks and an oatmeal pie to take home.  I told the cashier that I placed an order online, gave her my full name and she checked out the food behind her to see if it was ours.  We were then directed to take a seat and she would call us when our food is ready.  Queue waiting another 15 minutes- which I thought was very unusual.  I decided to approach the cashier again to inquire on our food.  I pointed to food behind that she had previously checked and asked her to double check.  Turns out that was our food- sitting for the last 15 minutes.  I placed an online order to make things easy and fast, spent over $50 to enjoy a nice dinner but was super disappointed when I opened our food...  Cold, soggy west coast fries, soggy Chicago philly and burger.  We literally wasted our money tonight.  We ended up throwing out everything but the kids cheese quesadilla.  Very disappointed in this location.  I know they can do better.",

This is definitely a place to ease people into vegetarianism.   I got the blackened jerk chicken pita (it wasn't spicy....?) and my boyfriend got the chicken parm (obviously not real chicken on either). Both were valiant attempts. They still failed. The fries were good, though.   I would give it only 1 star, but we did go at 8:15 pm and they close at 9. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....  The service was also really bad. Lady didn't look at us while we ordered (her eyes were wandering around), the bathrooms are outside with no signage, and I guess you are supposed to assume you order at the counter?   I am not trying to make this overly-critical, but this place could do A LOT better in many ways. I probably won't go back unfortunately; too bad, I was looking forward to this!",

    "text": "This is the place I go to religiously when I'm feeling like eating healthy. Being a pesceterian, I frequently get meat cravings, and GREEN is the place I run to. Their mock chicken is delicious, tasted just like real chicken, and their version of the Big Mack the \"Big Wack\" is even tastier than the real thing, from what I can remember! I absolutely recommend the spicy peanut chicken salad, it is so filling and full of flavor. To whoever judges vegan food as \"cardboard- like and tasteless\" needs to try Green. I have gotten several of my omnivorous friends to try this place and they have all loved the food and the atmosphere. Its very artsy-fartsy inside, and when you walk in you immediately feel the positive vibes bouncing off all the healthy people inside. Its really really nice overall. The location is a little hidden, but nevertheless, when you find the place you will always go back!  STAY GREEN!",

For dessert, I had a chocolate almond milkshake and my sister had the Soy Captain Tsoynami.   We're still in a little shock that EVERYTHING we had was 100% vegan. The three of us are lactose intolerant; I kept on waiting to get sick off the milkshake but it never happened.   The only complaint I have is that a places like Green are few and far between. Literally. I live in San Diego (I only know of one other fully vegan place in my area), Green is in Tempe, AZ.   As an omnivore with a meatatarian streak, Green is allll kinds of super amazing.",

We arrived to a long line out the door for ordering and another row of people who had already ordered and we're waiting for a table to sit at.  My daughter who is Vegan, was very excited with the menu, I struggled a bit more with it, feeling there weren't as many options without \"tofu\" meats in them.  We all ended up ordering burgers with fries.  I loved the fries because they were super skinny fries and came out hot, but I did not care for my burger which I felt was bland.  The kids did not care for how skinny the fries were but liked their burgers and my daughter said their food was good for being Vegan and she would go back.  My son and I both agreed we would not want to go back.  I will say that the long line never ended, so perhaps it's just not a great place for folks who like actual meat products.      The staff was super friendly and service was relatively quick as well, but the panic sets in when you think your food is coming and you still don't have a table.  It was also 100 degrees out when we went and the patio had no shade, umbrellas, trees or anything so sitting on the chairs and touching the tables was not a doable solution.",

Their imitation meat tastes delicious and has just the right amount of texture and flavor. I have also tried their wings, bowls, curries, and fries, and none of these have lived up to the standards that the burgers have set.  2. Tsoynamis- A must-have item! These soy-based ice creams are light, so Green serves you a very large amount with each order. They have a lot of different every-day flavors, as well as some seasonal ones on a board that they have. I highly recommend the \"Kissed by a rose\" flavor (rose, chocolate, strawberries) if that is up on the seasonal board.  3. Ambiance- Green is such a cute place to come grab lunch or a light snack. They are big supporters of local art, and have interchangeable art pieces on their walls that customers can buy. Everything has a sort of hipster-vibe to it, and with the natural light streaming in through their large windows, you will always leave the place feeling calmer and happier than when you came in.   Definitely recommend giving it a try!",

    "text": "My first review on Yelp(I am way overdue) and it undoubtedly has to be Green. My first venture to Green was actually before I was a Vegan, I had just transitioned to trying vegetarianism and I thought \" Wow, being a Vegan is easy!! \" Well not exactly, but Green helps - unfortunately not all Vegan food is as creative or tasty.  Green isn't a health food place but some of there items are better for you then others. But you can be sure you are not getting a stack of cholesterol/saturated fat and animal protein to give you years of bad health and interesting diseases (yep I said it).  Pretty much everything is good at Green, I can only think of one so-so meal I have ever had and it was a special.  I am convinced it was not made correctly in the first place. The Spicy Po'Boy sandwich was my 1st and 2nd meal at Green and still a favorite, all the burgers are good, pizza is decent, bowls all taste similar but are all great. Appetizers are cheap and all good(try the hummus, non-wings, crabless puffs). Tsoynamis are incredible. Most of their specials are good, and don't forget about Green on holidays when you feel like not eating an animal(like the majority of folks). July 4th this year had an excellent spread and all for $5(which went to charity of course).  I forgot about the location a long time ago, yes the strip mall is nothing special and unsightly but who really cares. The atmosphere inside has improved over the years and all the people who work there and go there all seem to be quite chill(even the meat eaters). I just wish there was a second location closer to me in North-Cen Phoenix(maybe someday)  Phoenix doesn't have a ton of Vegan restaurants, but this place rivals other Vegan restaurants in much more Vegan friendly cities. My one complaint(or hope) is that someday they won't have to call things \"mock chicken\" and \"mock beef\". I know this is to appeal to the masses and most people even in the Vegan community could care less but TVP, Seitan, etc all have a unique taste and texture and should be celebrated for that and called exactly what they are. \"Wheat meat\", \" Veggie meat\", \"soy meat\", whatever. Animal \"meat\" doesn't have the bounty on the word meat, what do you call the innards of a coconut or avocado? Ahhh now you get me, ok end of rant.  Go to Green, Carnivore or Herbivore, or anything in between, for the good food/atmosphere. Keep coming back for the reasons of why Green exists at all.",

One of my previous complaints was that besides some of their sandwiches and their salads, their food was particularly oily, or greasy, etc. I thought, this place is too good not to have some sort of alternative to this situation and guess what? There is a solution. I admit, I prematurely judged the cuisine before asking enough questions. Turns out, almost everything on the menu, especially the entrees are customizable to the point that you can almost make anything on the menu fit your preference and the staff is more than accommodating and gracious about it.   I have since had a lot of items on the menu and been able to get many items to fit my dietary preferences: sandwiches (the Wendy's Pickle is a great customizable one), almost all the bowls I have tried with less oil, steamed veggies, or light sauce, etc. The salads I have swapped out the meats for different kinds of tofu or light sauce, etc. Almost every time, my food has been delicious and if it wasn't, it was usually because my choice of customization was poor.   Not to mention, like I said in the last review, this location has great service, as do all the locations and it is clean too.   Whether a ravenous carnivore, local vegetarian vegan, out-of-towner, or whatever, I can pretty much attest to the fact that you'll more than likely find one, probably, two items on the menu to satisfy an appetite.",

I was to meet her and got there a little early so I went in to have coffee while I waited. As soon as I walked in I noticed that you had to order at the counter. I asked for a cup of coffee and got told that they only served iced coffee. OK. So I asked for it without ice. I was handed a small plastic tumbler with a lid and a straw and a brown liquid in it. That was $4. It was then that I saw the sign saying Iced Latte $4. I sat down and tried it. It tasted like dishwater and adding two packets of organic cane sugar didn't help. That's when my girlfriend called. She'd mistakenly gone to the Phoenix location and was on the way back. I reported my impressions and she confirmed that the Phoenix location was a dump, too. We decided not to take a chance on potentially over-priced food and went to eat at Chili's instead. I see from other recent reviews that I'm not the only one with these issues.",

That doesn't mean I won't accept alternatives here and there. I felt somewhat healthier as a vegetarian and do enjoy eating like one once in a while. So yesterday I tried Green.. Now let me just say, a lot of places I have tried like this have been seriously disappointing. Either it tastes like hydrogenated dog shit or looks like it.. and I once found a rubber band in my Black-eyed Pea Cake at Blossom, but we'll save that story for another review.. Green however, did not disappoint.   Edamame to start, because I am a super fan of it and eat it whenever possible.. I like that they served it with lime. Something I had never thought to add, but it was a nice touch. Then I had the Apricot Miso with mock chicken and pan fried noodles. Certainly an interesting dish, with a stir fry type mix of pineapple, dried apricots, sliced apples, broccoli and some other vegetables, in a sweet yet kinda spicy sauce which was really good. My buddy had the Original \"G\" spicy Po boy, and it was also tasty. You could barely tell the difference between \"real\" and \"mock\", which is hard to do. The interior is super cute and funky. I liked that, but there was absolutely no where to sit, so we went outside and sat in the shade, which wasn't too terrible.. also a good sign that summer is ending sooner than later.   One complaint I do have... bring your own fork! I know it sounds silly but they only have forks carved out of wood, which break upon entering pretty much anything I tried to use it for. .   Definitely try Green. Vege or not, its worth a visit.",

    "text": "I get asked \"Have you been to Green yet?\" almost as often as I get asked \"Have you done a summer here yet?\" Thankfully, I can now say yes to the first question. And I think Green may be an answer to my survival of the summer here in AZ.  My friend and I wanted to get a bike ride on a beautiful night but didn't want to just get a beer and we kind of wanted to go around the Tempe lake, ruling out southern Tempe options. Green. Green is open on Mondays! (BUT NOT SUNDAYS) And til 9! Its 7:15-lets get our asses movin'!  Smack inbetween major traffic lights (thus hard to cross), we found a full parking lot and an empty bike rack...sweeeet. Just about every table was full with a pretty diverse crowd-mostly hip, but everyone was real casual and didn't have their Scottsdale poker face on. I was confused when we first walked in-do we get seated? I stared and smiled at one woman who I thought was a waitress-but then she sat down. Whoops. A tad awkward, no? Went to the counter and greeted with beautiful lil menus-they have a LOT of stuff. AND I CAN EAT ALL OF IT.  I am a lactose-intolerant vegetarian. But not vegan. But a vegan diet is the healthiest one for me, obvi. My mind was blown away. Even at vegetarian places I still have half the menu eliminated due to dairy. Only at the Angelika Kitchen in NYC Village am I this over-whelmed. And while Green may not be as healthy-who really cares when its THIS GOOD? I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6.50? That is VALUE. I opted for the fountain soda (their unsweetened iced tea is a good deal), but I saw they have Virgils' Root Beer, the best root beer on earth after Stewarts-and will totally get that next time.   We sat down in the somewhat dimly lit room-it is kind of industrial feeling, but not hippy at all-but not overly chic at all. Reminds me of a cross b/w Orange Table and Lux in terms of ambiance with the casualness and hottie factor of Pita Jungle. There were multi-coloured car doors lined up on the far wall of the restaurant and the noise level was cordial. We got our Crab Cream Puffs first-ooooooommmmyyyygoooood. For like 3 something, I was in a very special place. I didnt even know you could do that with tofutti cream cheese! Amazing with a sweet tangy sauce. Our food came pretty quickly and I got to have my thyme fries with a side of Vegannaise. My sandwich was HUGE and for no other ways to describe it as BANGIN. I miss Philly Cheese Steaks-and this is my happy replacement!   The owner ended up talking to us and I asked about the soy ice cream-they were out of cones which made me inexplicibly sad. He said they do Soy-namis, which are their version of Dairy Queen's Blizzards where they made a thick shake with goodies added in. I walked back up to the counter and had trouble figuring out what I could possibly add to my stomach so I didn't keel over in a food coma off my bike on the way home. I went for the super sweet and did like a sundae in a cup with newmans chocolate oreo things and chocolate sauce with cherries. It was amazing. It was like 3.50 and it was too much for us 2 to share...but that doesn't mean we didn't finish it.  I can't believe it took me this long to come here-the atmosphere, options and the cheapness of the food shocked me. I mean, people had told me it was good, I just didn't expect it to be THIS good.  My friend even admitted she went back the next night b/c she couldnt stop thinking about my sandwich!  So yes, those Soy-Namis may be how I will \"do a summer in AZ' '07!",

The best kept secret in the man-world: the women who work and dine here  are so bloody hot. If you're a straight male human, lonely, longing for the touch of a beautiful woman, eat here. Everyday. You're bound to get lucky, at the very least because positive karma will be catching up with you for not supporting any of the evil industries.   Original review:   I love this place. I went twice yesterday. I seriously cannot get enough. As a transitioning vegetarian/vegan, the food here is a dream come True. Everything I've had is amazing. Very tasty. The chocolate and organic peanut butter tsoynami is the best dessert I think I've ever had, vegan or not. But what the fuck is up with the temperature in that place? Vegans like a temperate place to eat as much as anyone. I can't eat in there. It's so hot. I have to get my food to go or only eat there in the winter. I just don't get it. Aren't the employees uncomfortable? How could I be the only one this bothers? That's a wrap is similarly uncomfortable, but more tolerable. All that complaining aside, I cannot recommend this place enough for the food. It's, quite frankly, delicious.",

    "text": "For some odd reason I got a wild hair up my butt and wanted to try a vegetarian restaurant.  I still have no idea why.  My wife and I are not vegans or anything close to it, but I still wanted to try something new and exciting.  I wanted something close to home and Green was rated the best in my area so I figured what the heck.  The place looked exactly like what I expected.  I am totally preppy so my only words to describe it is \"hippy\".  The place was pretty packed with weird hippy people but everyone was very nice.  It wasn't really my scene but it didn't matter because I was there for the food and a new experience.  When my wife and I first entered the establishment we first waited for a hostess to seat us for a few seconds.  Then, after figuring out that it was probably a seat yourself type of place, we took a seat and waited for a waitress/waiter.  Most of the other tables had people looking over menus so we figured that a waitress/waiter took orders.  After a few minutes of sitting, we decided that we should probably go up to the counter and order.  Not that I had a problem with it, its just that it was very confusing.  Anyway, here is the rundown of what we ordered and my rating of it.   * spicy buffalo wings - they didn't look like it, but they did have the texture and flavor of real wings....kinda.  The sauce was good and spicy but was very very salty.  The \"ranch\" was good too.  I would order this again.  * artichoke gratine - very good and pretty spicy - I would order again  * green burger - neither myself or my wife was a fan of this.  * diablo red bowl - I actually thought this was good.  Aside from it being very very very very salty, the dish was very flavorful and had a nice kick to it.  I ordered it with mock beef which somehow had the texture and flavor of beef.  All in all I thought this place was ok.  The staff is friendly, the food was ready quickly and the prices are reasonable.  My only real issue is with the food.  Since I don't have any issues eating meat, I would just assume go to a place that serves real meat.  This place goes through a lot of trouble to make food that tastes/looks/feels/smells like meat for a bunch of people that don't want to eat meat.  It is all very strange to me.  Although I probably won't be back unless I develop a severe allergy to meat and dairy, I would recommend it to people who want to try something different.  You probably won't find a better place to try out the vegan lifestyle and truly appreciate your carnivorous ways.",

While I have been eating a plant-based diet for a long time now, Green was really helpful when I first started because I could find vegan comfort food. When I got tired of beans and rice and vegetables, Green was a place where I could get variety and now understand that vegans have tons of food options.   My overall favorite meal there is the no-harm chicken parm, but I also love the bowls when I want something lighter (particularly Singapore orange and blonde Alfredo). I also can't avoid the tsoynamis, although I generally eat the entire thing at once and then feel crummy from sugar overload which is totally my fault. If you're vegan and are craving chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, try the dough boy tsoynami.  The staff is always friendly, and I love the diversity of people that come eat at Green. One of my favorites!",

    "text": "So I'm going to preface this by stating the probably obvious: I'm not a vegan. I'm much closer to the carnivore end of the spectrum. I like meat, and things you eat with meat, and occasionally vegetables. I accepted an invite to meet someone here with a certain amount of anxiety.  But hey, I'm not new to the Interwebs. So I did a little homework. I looked at the menu and found some items that sounded okay. And I read my friend sunny b's reviews here, because she knows this stuff. This made me a little less nervous.  Carnivores, take it from me: no need to worry. This place ROCKS. The buffalo wings are plenty spicy - I liked them better than any actual chicken wings I've ever had. The samosas were wonderful: a nice flaky crust, and the filling was very savory with an excellent texture. I had the Mongolian bowl with not-beef, which was delicious: good noodles, fresh vegetables, and the only way I knew the not-beef wasn't beef was the texture. The portions were great and the staff was friendly.  For dessert, I got an oatmeal pie: two oatmeal cookies with a creme filling between. DELICIOUS!   I definitely recommend this place, and I will certainly eat there again when I'm in the area.",

I live in north phx, so green is a little further away from me, but it is totally worth the drive.   I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings. I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian. I used to miss meat but after I found Green, I stopped having a craving to eat meat. Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had.   My best friend is a full on meat lover, but one day I made her come with me to Green. She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it. So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian, this is a must try.  oh and a little side note, the service is so amazing. The employees are so nice and caring. You can tell they really love their job. Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff.. so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food.",

More importantly, the dishes served here can fullfill your junk-food cravings.  I am a vegetarian, but not usually a fan of mock meat products. Green does such a great job at creating tasty vegan creations that the mixed crowd will amaze you. Not to stereotype the vegan \"look\", but if you come in to Green during the very busy lunch rush, I would bet money that 50% of the patrons are regular meat-eaters. The food is just THAT good!  I have tried most everything on the menu, and my personal favorites are:  spicy buffalo \"wings\" jerk tofu salad mexicali burger thai peanut bowl with crispy tofu original \"g\" spicy po-boy sammy  One more thing:  They always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts.",

Prices are a tad high, but not really for being in Scottsdale, and for the unique kind of food they offer.  I will give two criticisms. First, I often go with my non-vegetarian wife, and I will have to say their choice of foods for her is very limited.  I'm not saying they should offer non-vegan foods, but I'm saying they could add a few more \"normal\" non-meat choices.  Maybe a few more salads, a veggie pizza, etc.  She had the Mac & Cheese which is something that might attract someone like my wife, and even I will have to say, it wasn't very good.   Second, the cleanliness of the place, and the overall feeling of the place could be improved.   While there seems to be all types inside, and it has a distinctive hippy vibe. If you don't have a nose ring and dreadlocks it gets easy to feel out-of-place, which is a shame because the food is very good.  Still, I do feel they should invest a bit more time in atmosphere improvements.  I know my food doesn't contain cows or pigs, but I'd like a bit more confidence that it doesn't include bug parts.",

My husband had the BBQ burger, which he said tasted like cardboard with a layer of sauce which made it...in his words \"edible\". He made a good point that without the \"special sauce\" mine probably would've tasted pretty bland too. My little one had the kids \"burger\" and fries. He didn't realize it wasn't real meat, so that was good :) My other one wasn't as adventurous and just wanted a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. I happened to notice on the receipt they upcharged us 50 cents to add cucumber (really, $6.50 for lettuce, cucumber and dressing?). Anyways. Kids wanted a chocolate chip cookie for $2 each, which they both said tasted good but a bit dry. I ordered the Banana Cream pie Tsoynami, which I highly recommend. It was huge so you may want to share it. I may have to stop back for another if I'm in the area sometime, but I highly doubt we're going back for the food anytime soon.",

I knew I would like it upon first walking in, and indeed it was very good! They had a lot of fake meat products on the menu, but I decided to go with the Mongolian Tofu. It had great flavor, and it was very filling. I also drank the Sweet Lime, which was very refreshing, especially in 106 degree heat. Everyone we were with enjoyed their food, except my boyfriend, who wasn't too into their version of fake mozzarella cheese...was kind of rubbery, but um, what do you expect? Real cheese is where it's at, hence the reason I could never be a vegan. The inside of this place is also cute -- my kind of place! I wish there was something similar to this in SF, because I would go a lot!",

    "text": "Oh Green! How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...  1. You are 100% vegan. I have a plethora of choices to eat from and not have to worry about what its made with and if its vegan or not.   2. Tsoynamis. Nuf' said.  3. Vegan crab puffs!!!  4. You have specials that change all of the time! I just wish you would make about 90% of these specials permanent menu items! I love some of them so much it depresses me when they run out or are no longer available. Example, the Chicken Schwarma wrap. I would KILL for that to be on the menu. It is my favorite thing ever.   5. Most of your staff are some of the coolest people ever, and always remember us. Its nice when staff remember you (and your favorite specials). It also helps that my husband and I have been here at least 50 times in the last year.   6. You don't just make me choose from a few measly salads. You have sandwiches, pizza, pasta, bowls, appetizers. The BBQ chicken and the Mexicali burgers are the greatest things ever.   7. You are relatively close to my house, and I don't have to trek 30 miles to get there. So if at 8pm I decide I want you, I can get to you and not have to worry about making it before you close.   8. You have an in store market where if I feel the need to pick up a box of vegan mac and cheese, I can.   There are tons of reasons to eat here, whether you are vegan or not. You have to try this place. It is amazing and no matter what you get off the menu, you will not be disappointed.",

The spice level of the sauce was perfect it had a really nice kick to it, but not  the point of watering eyes. My one complaint was the gluten free bread. The texture and density of it was not good.  It was really dry and it soaked up too much of the sauces on my sandwich.   Not going to lie though,  I was still hungry after I finished eating. Mind you i just finished playing a sand volleyball tournament. So next I ordered the green hummus the chicken wings and the BFF which is a fried \"chicken\" sandwich to try and take home leftovers. The hummus was great, as well as the corn tortilla chips it was served with, nice and crunchy. The hummus said it was made with roasted poblano peppers which I didn't notice but it was very tasty. I didn't like the quality of the \"chicken\" wings as much as the chicken in the chicken sandwich. It may have been the same but just sliced differently. And as for the BFF fried chicken sandwich it was outstanding. non-vegans might have thought this was real Fried Chicken. I also asked for a side of their Expreso barbecue sauce which turned out to have great tang and flavor. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.",

Every time I come back there's something new and something old.  Improvements and renovations are always made in this quaint little corner restaurant.  I don't feel like I'm a hippie when I come here since there seems to be all walks of life young and old that come here.    Today I started with a craft beer and the Big Wac Burger.  I actually order the little Wac with fries since the Big Wac seemed like a little too big for my appetite.  Overall, it was a knock-off version of the Big Mac, but with no processed meat.  I thought it was pretty interesting, but in the end nothing too original.  My buddy ordered their spicy buffalo wings made with soy chicken -- this was probably my favorite bite of the night; spicy indeed and a hint of crunch.  I think if they didn't douse it was the sauce it would have made a perfect combination, but still good overall.  I also ordered the Soynami for dessert; a valley favorite and must eat especially during the summer time.  It's pretty much soft serve ice cream in a pint with toppings of your choice of candies or baked goods.    In the end, Green is definitely a local hot spot for vegetarians, but also foodies whom want to venture out and try something new.  With the popularity of Non-GMO and Vegan movement coming strong; I can see Green staying for generations ahead! - Enjoy!",

I bet you're thinking a meat eater wouldn't find anything good or filling at a Vegetarian/Vegan place, but I'm here to let you know, you can! And you will walk away full and liking the meal you just had!  After checking out the menu, I went with Thai Peanut bowl, right of the bat I knew I loved spicy peanut sauces, so this was up my alley, and it comes with pan fried noodles (you can get rice too if that's your thing) sauteed veggies and I picked mock chicken to go with mine, but since I wasn't sure if I would like the mock chicken, I asked for it on the side.  When the dish arrived, it looked like a great stir-fry bowl, it didn't scream vegan at all.  The mock chicken, to me looked like and had the texture of chicken nuggets, but were better tasting, I was kind of disappointed I asked for them on the side, instead of the dish so they could get saucy,  but next time I'll know.  This was a great meal, everything tasted great including the mock chicken. Glad to have tried Green, I also like that Green is Vegan restaurant that offers comfort food.   Looking forward to trying out more dishes for sure!",

    "text": "I am the reigning Duke here so clearly I love Green. However, I'm writing an updated review because Green has changed. They still get 5 stars for being all vegan, having convenient locations, green practices, friendly staff, and a mostly good menu.   They recently changed their menu and removed the noodles, fettuccine Alfredo and pesto sauces and consolidated their salad, rice bowl, and sandwich options, and made a few other changes. They no longer have a small salad, just large for about $10, but what if you just want a side salad? Not an option. Sides like coleslaw are now only al la carte instead of automatically coming with the sandwiches - not a big deal, but if you're a hungry guy you'll need more food than just a sandwich. Other than the Karma Curry, their rice bowls (Thai Peanut, Singapore Orange, and Sesame Dragon) all kind of taste the same now - like a mixture of soy sauce and sriracha and the sauce is heavy. Overall there's fewer options and we miss some of our old favs.   Plus, on and off for about a year (not related to menu changes) their tofu has had a funny taste. I mentioned it to them and they said they were experimenting. It hasn't gotten better. And it's not consistently bad so it makes me wonder if it's sometimes spoiled or they are miss-handling it. It tastes and smells like mothballs. I only get fresh/steamed tofu so maybe the fried tofu loses the mothball flavor. If you get the fresh and it happens to be one of these off batches I speak of, you will know. It's so bad I spit it out and then pick out the rest and swear I'm done with these tofu defilers. But then I order it again and hope someone else has complained and they've fixed it.   Our favs now are the Ranchero salad with wing sauce instead of BBQ sauce, Wendy's Pickle, Tahini Coleslaw, Dagobah Jungle (as a wrap versus salad), Chili, Thee Fighting Artichoke salad, and of course their Nami treats like Tsoynamis (dairy free blizzards), cookies, and cupcakes. The salads are fresh and the sandwiches are consistently good.  Like I said in the last review, the staff seem to like their jobs and they get our take-out orders right almost EVERY time, which is amazing, and there's never any accidental cheese or meat in our food. But with fewer menu options to mix things up we definitely don't eat here as often and I expect to lose my crown.",

All was very obviously precooked and very dry. Too bad as we are both vegans and eat out so infrequently. I would always be happy to wait for fresh food but it seems they were sandbagging the burgers and fries to stay ahead of the rush. Good idea for the cooks ticket time but that's about it. Still 3 stars as I appreciate the effort and it was good the first time.",

    "text": "My cousin and her friend came into town and we were looking for a place to have a quick lunch. Her friend came across this place on yelp & wanted to try it out. They both are vegetarians and I am a meat lover but I'm always down for trying new places and new things. Plus I don't mind eating like a vegetarian every once in a while!   I ordered the spicy po boy & decided to enjoy a nice cold kilt lifter along with that. That po boy was one of the best I've ever had! It came with mock chicken which was kind of hard to eat because when you take a bite, it doesn't break apart that easily. It was like I took a bite and the whole piece came out right with it haha. The buffalo sauce was a bit overpowering. It had this tang to it that really hits you. When I took a bite and inhaled some air through my mouth, that buffalo sauce completely just choked me. That's the only thing that I didnt like about the sandwich. It wasn't drenched in Buffalo sauce so it balanced out very well.   The ice/water machine is funny! It has pictures of ice cube (the rapper) face on it. Overall it's a very chill place! Kind of small on the inside but I'd definitely come back to eat here again to try different items on their menu!",

The Big Wac actually tasted just like a Big Mac... plus they had their own version of the \"special sauce\" which was great!   The staff was very nice and friendly too.   The reason we gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because they were a little stingy with the \"meat\" on the cheesesteak. For the price of the sandwich, we would have liked a few more slices of the meat.   With that being said, we would still recommend the restaurant and we will definitely return very soon!",

Kids chicken nuggs are a good go bite plus who doesnt crave chicken nuggets when you're not so into chicken anymore!? They come with fries too so this is a plus.  Orange chicken rice bowl was sooo good as well, I could taste the fresh orange taste and even had leftovers for lunch the next day!  Chicago cheesesteak sounded like the ingredients may not mix well together but in my surprise this handheld was very flavorful and warm!  Crab puffs were a pretty good imitation of actual ones, tasted more cheesy but id prefer this since im not a huge crab fan!  Tahini coleslaw was my side choice and I have never tried it before but glad I did, its a refreshing nutty twist to add to your palette.   My fav fav fav option here is the oatmeal cookie creme pie things, WOW, they are often sold out of these so get them while you can but its well worth it! ($4 or $5) Sometimes I treat myself to their delish drinks in the fridges this time it was an original rootbeer which I thought was a nice refresher.  Staff is always nice here and food always tastes fresh!",

I zipped on over to Green around 6:15pm knowing full well that there would be a long line for dinner. I didn't care. I did it anyway because life is too short for second guessing your instincts.   Ok, so I pulled into the parking lot which was stuffed, however, the universe was on my side and I found a nice spot relatively close to the restaurant. As I was walking, a much taller lady out walked me and got to the door first, grrrrrr. Oh well, it eased the pain because she was nice and held the door open for me. I knew now I was going to have to wait even longer for the sandwich. Inside, the line was only 6 people long. Hoooray!!! The lady who got in front of me was only there for a glass of water. Double hurray!! After a short wait in line I ordered the Chicago cheesesteak and asked for a recommendation for the Tsoynami. I wanted chocolate, that was my only stipulation. The guy taking my order suggested a few mixes. I finally settled on the chocolate ice cream with a crushed cupcake and pretzels with chocolate sauce.   Now that was one of the best decisions I made all week. Great place, great food, great ice cream, great service. Every time.  I ordered the",

The atmosphere is also nice, it has bright colours and is very clean. It is a smaller restaurant, and during busier times you may have to wait for a table to open but it won't be for very long.   Myself and some friends all each got something different and tried each others food. I had the Classic Burger with white onions added and a side of thyme fries. The burger was very good, a bit vinegary due to the pickles but that's okay. The fries were delicious, and the ketchup here is unique and tasty.  One friend ate Green Hummus, and while the hummus and chips were good, the chips broke apart making it a bit hard to eat. Still was delicious.  Another ate the Chicago Cheesesteak, and had no complaints! It was yummy, filling and had no hiccups. She also ordered chili fries, which were loved by all.  And last but not least, another ordered the Secret Sammie ( pictured ). The food was delicious, though a bit messy.  And last but not least we are all enjoying a tSoynami, and it is FANTASTIC. All in all a great experience.",

I wasn't too much a fan of them as they were a little chewy and tangy for my taste, but still edible; I wouldn't order them again.   The Big Wac which is their version of a \"Big Mac\" from McDonalds was delicious. It had two vegan patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, sesame seed buns. I definitely would recommend this! The items are a la carte, didn't order fries but they did look good!  I added a peanut butter bar to the side for dessert. They're known for their shakes so I'm bummed I didn't try one!  Prices are average..came out to $21.45 after tip. I also added a shirt for an additional $15, which anything with pixels will sell me, so I had to give in!",

    "text": "Both Green locations that I have been to (Phoenix and Scottsdale) used to be our go-to for Vegetarian Cuisine years ago.  Their food and concept were both quite fresh, and exciting.   However, our recent visit seemed to reflect the fact that their quality and allure have since slid down the ranking scale.  As always, I ordered the Buffalo wings. The sauce was still tangy and exciting as I had remembered. But, the breading on the faux chicken was dreadful. It seemed as if it is been underdone, and then basted in the sauce before being fully cooked.   The carrot and celery sticks tasted old as if they had been sitting out for a while.  My wife ordered the Sesame Dragon. It was a concoction of something that was hard to ascertain. It had so diverse on the flavor scale that it seemed as if it were a dish that had yet to find it's identity. Experimentation should be left in the kitchen, and not served to unsuspecting customers. The broccoli had a hardened texture as if it were also undercooked. I am not sure what was going on in the Kitchen that day, but they were definitely having an off day.  Now, the Electic Nectar was as refreshing as ever. At least their juices were still up to the level of our expectations. Nothing else seemed reminiscent of their former great quality. It was definitely such a disappointment.",

Use this time to decide from the options on the menu or the refrigerator full of kombucha.  This time I got the Singapore Orange rice bowl with the mock chicken. The sauce was a little too salty, but still tasty. Their mock chicken was downright delicious and I could eat it all the time. My boyfriend always get the po' boy sandwich and scarfed it down so fast I could only get one bite out of it.  Lastly, I decided to try the Donatello tSoynami soft serve (vanilla with pecans, caramel sauce, and chocolate chips) for the first time and it was so delicious! Finally an \"ice cream\" I don't regret eating later!  I definitely recommend anyone to try the food here, even if you aren't vegetarian.",

The verdict: same great food and incredibly friendly and laid back service. Win and win!  My husband opted for the special of the night, which was a huge carnitas burrito drenched in enchilada sauce. I am pretty sure he licked the plate. I went for tacos, and while the special taco was good, the standee \"ultimo\" taco won the day. I could go back for two more of those right now!  As mentioned, service was tops. The guy who took our order was helpful and laid back, not at all annoyed that we took our time and changed our order once. The guy that brought our food was funny and cool. It was a no stress environment, even though it was pretty crowded.  Green is always going to be a go-to restaurant for us, and it's great to know both locations are knocking it out!",

I waited a few minutes to order and the food was ready in about 10 minutes. The fries were thin and tasty, and came with ketchup and some type of ranch that I didn't like but also didn't hate. The wings were good, sometimes you just need that savory chewy texture. I'll be back for a tsoynami...",

There was a constant flow of customers in and out in the 2 hours were sat, ate and talked. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you; the line moved fast and the food was fast to come out of the kitchen piping hot  We started with the \"buffalo\" wings - the sauce was super flavorful and the dipping sauce was sooo good we ordered more to go with our meals  I had the \"Wendy Pickle\" - closest vegetarian Chik-Fil-A sandwich ever! It was so flavorful and the fries that came with it were great!  My husband had the \"Big Wac\" - vegetarian version of the Big Mac - he said it was amazing!  To finish it off we had the Dough Boy for dessert - YUM YUM YUM!!!  We cannot wait to go back :)",

Everything from the string of white lights to earth toned chairs, tables, and even biodegradable spoons is refreshing! One of the best things here besides the food is the tea/lemonade/sweet-lime drinks. It's also free refill!   Back to the food -- The mock chicken was pretty good, I could eat this in place of real chicken any day! I couldn't even tell it was mock chicken. The No-Harm-Chicken-Parm Sandwich was so tasty and big enough to share between two. The Thai Peanut Bowl was just right, not to heavy, not to light. It's healthy, very flavorful, filling, and you can tell you're getting all the right nutrients!   Desert was one of the best parts of our meal. Forget Ben&Jerry's, now I'm always going to be craving the Coffee Co Loco Ice Cream . One thing that's very surprising about is that they place soy ice cream in the mix with coffee grinds. I know, coffee grinds? The coffee grinds are neither dry or bitter, its almost like they're mini vanilla beans or even sprinkles of chocolate. They also place chocolate and coco puffs. What I wonder is how do the coco puffs never get soggy? They're in the bottom of the ice cream and they're still crunchy.   Overall, I'm a definite fan of Green -- Makes me think if I could turn Vegan.  Con: For optimal studying purposes, I wish they had just a tad more light (Day light bulbs)",

Green doesn't quite meet (meat?) this standard: though they make some of the best meatless meat dishes in town, I still catch myself thinking, \"This would be even better if it was made of beef and bacon.\" Their imitation beef and chicken are impressively like the real things, but that's the fundamental problem (in my humble opinion) with this style of vegetarian cuisine: no matter how good you make it, \"like the real thing\" is never gonna beat the real thing. Their veggie burgers are tasty, but burgers are tastier. Soynamis are pretty good, but milkshakes will always be better. I know that New American is their thing, but I think Green would be even better if they took a little more inspiration from traditions like Indian and Middle Eastern, which have done spectacular things without meat for thousands of years.  None of this, of course, means I won't continue to eat here pretty frequently. I love their egglessrolls, poboys (both Original and Argentine... especially the Argentine with extra chimichurri sauce). Their thyme fries are pretty good, but I don't really taste the thyme. I've gotten a couple bowls, which have been good but a little sparse on the mock meat. A cheap and delicious option is to get a side of lo mein with some mock beef.",

As far as the quality of the taste, my mind was blown.  I am not vegan or vegetarian, in fact the majority of my current diet is meat based, so I was unsure what exactly to expect. I was highly impressed with the number of available options.  I ate the buffalo chicken po' boy.  The ciabatta was crisp, the lettuce was fresh, the soy based \"chicken\" was a perfect dupe, and the buffalo flavor was akin to the deliciousness of Franks and Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauces.  My only regret was that I did not try their coy ice cream.  I will certainly be dining here again just to try out some more of the delicious menu items.",

    "text": "Green catered my anniversary party recently. I was happy that we were able to offer a vegetarian meal that my whole family could enjoy. I love to eat at the Tempe location whenever I'm in town visiting.   A couple downsides for the event catering was that they provided the plates, and we quickly ran out during appetizers. Luckily my Dad was wiling to run out and grab some, but of course he brought back styrofoam instead of the compostable plates I would have preferred. But really he had no options on such short notice.   The other downside was that the sauces for the chicken wing and the salad were not labeled, so there was some confusion on our guests part as to what sauce went with what.   But overall, Green delivered a tasty meal.",

    "text": "First, as many other reviewers here, I am not a vegan or vegetarian. With that out there, today I had lunch at Green with some coworkers and I was really looking forward to the experience. Time was short so we did pick up and I ordered chili with a side of tahini coleslaw. $8. Eight bucks for 2 tiny little side containers (see pictures ... taken before a spoon or fork ever touched the food ... They did not even FILL the little cup of freakin chili) most other restaurants would use these for sides of dressing . I actually thought they were joking when they brought it out. The taste is okay .... Nothing fancy nor exceptional .... The chili was pretty salty ... And cold....and when I ordered the tahini slaw I assumed it would be garlicky and creamy but this is pasty and tastes vaguely of peanut butter. If I had half a brain I would have asked for my money back but I think I was still in sticker shock. The place was overly warm and dingy so I was glad to miss that dining experience. However My coworkers ordered the ice cream and were very impressed. Maybe I will return for a sweet treat but never ever for a meal. My $8 bucks would have gone much further elsewhere. It's crazy to be just as hungry when you've finished eating as when you started. Total waste of funds. For my own experience, 1 star .... The extra one is for the ice cream because everyone seemed to really enjoy it .... Especially our lactose intolerant ladies!",

I waited in line for 5 minutes, which was fine but when I got to the register to order the woman was very short with me.   I asked for a side of potatoes and in a condescending manner, she said, \"its lunch.  we have french fries\"   I ended up ordering a side of tempeh bacon and a wings appetizer.  My two children and I then waited for 24 minutes and nothing came.  When I saw a couple, that came in 10 minutes after us, receive their food, I went back to the register.   Same woman, dark hair, very rude.   I waited until she finished her personal conversation then asked about my order.  She replied, \"there are a lot of orders\"  When i explained my situation she was very dismissive and rolled her eyes at me.   I asked for a refund and she said sure, just gave me the cash and didnt even look at me.  I asked for a manager, she came out and just said \"'im sorry\"  I am so disappointed in the complete lack of customer service at a restaurant that I really love.   In the end we left with no food after a total of 35 minutes.",

    "text": "The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant.   I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.  So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:  *Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.  *Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... True it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!  *Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.  *Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!  Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.  Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.    Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",

    "text": "I've been anxiously awaiting to try this place for months!  I'll start with the good...  I'm not a vegan by any stretch and I thought the food was phenomenal! I ordered the Singapore orange bowl with mock chicken and noodles...just wonderful! Seasoned well, fresh veggies, and the mock chicken was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to taste and feel fake, but the taste and texture was just like chicken!   My friend ordered the MAC and I swear it tasted exactly like a Big Mac from McDonald's! The thyme fries are delish as well!  To top it off I had a cookie dough Tsoynami...OMG...amazing. Like a blizzard that tasted and had the texture similar to mochi. I loved it.  So clearly the food is not the issue. I will come back despite the problems I'm about to list because the food is so good!  The bad...  I was not happy with the service I received. Not warm or friendly at all. I don't appreciate that smug hipster attitude. Sorry. And they don't serve a hot chai latte??? That was annoying. So I settled for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then acted annoyed when I asked for it.  My tea cup was dirty. It had lipstick on it. Hello, we are in the middle of a flu outbreak right now! Not happy about that.   It is expensive. $5 for some ice cream (the tsoynami)? You will not get your money's worth here.  Not many options if you can't have soy. It is in practically everything.  The food gave me horrible gas (sorry tmi). Not the fault of the place but just be aware if you're not used to vegan food. Maybe it was the mock chicken and/or tsoynami because I eat veggies all the time.",

I got the madras curry bowl with extra roasted vegetables which was packed with broccoli especially.  This is a rare occasion that I feel almost better eating out as I would if cooking at home.  Good amount of sauce to flavor the dish but not overdo it.  Also, I've missed ice cream since becoming sensitive to dairy and a small sample of the soy swirl ice cream really hit the spot.",

Putting that aside, the good news is that I ended up at Green, and it was delicious.  The Thai Peanut bowl was seriously delicious-  great peanut taste coupled with that coconut milk balance and a little zang of spice with perfectly cooked noodles.  The \"mock\" chicken was whatever, the texture always gives it away for me.    They also have a great selection of beverages of the healthy variety, and some fresh juices that were also quite delicious.    I would actually come back here, even if other options were present.

While vegetarian food is hardly new, finding a place that was totally packed and had such varied items on the menu was an new experience.  We all started out with the eggless rolls ($4.00). Crisp, beautifully made spring rolls with cabbage, carrots, noodles, and spices, served with a lovely dipping sauce. This was so good that it set the stage for high expectations for the main course, and we were not disappointed.   Most of us ordered the Big-Wac ($9.00), a perfect take off on the Big Mac*. It was offered with your choice of frys, fruit, or cole slaw. Even with your eyes open you believe this was made at the golden arches. The faux meat looked and had the texture of real meat patties. It even had special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and a sesame seed bun. It was also just as filling as the variety with meat. This came in a basket filled to overflowing with pencil thin French fries with what had to be homemade ketchup. The only word that comes to mind is delicious.  One of our companions ordered the kung pao bowl ($8.50). While he said he could taste the difference between the faux meat and the real thing, he none the less said it was very tasty and enjoyed it.  A number of us ordered dessert. A large cup filled from the bottom first with cookies, then homemade banana ice cream, and topped with whipped cream. I could not finish either my burger or my dessert.  Beverages are all non-alcoholic, with assorted teas being the only option for those who cannot have sugar.  The premises were clean, and tables were bussed almost as soon as they were emptied. Service was prompt and courteous.  3 stars for quality of food, service, and cleanliness.",

I appreciated this a lot. Also in the fridge, there were so many drink options including various teas and kombuchas. The people working there were so nice, and the place was so clean.

We are the Big Wac (a classic) and it tasted phenomenal. Everything has a different twist and the price point isn't bad. Definitely check it out!!",

    "text": "Go to Green! I've had problems in the past with servers, but I believe those employees have moved on from Green. Other than that, let me list the reasons why I love Green:  1. I am a vegetarian. It's nice to have a completely vegan restaurant--I don't have to worry about what I can/cannot eat on the menu! Also, the food tastes like vegetarian food. This could be confusing to meat-eaters, so let me explain; a lot of vegetarian options at places that serve meat are cooked like you would cook meat, therefore the taste is different. It's nice not to be overloaded with spices or sauce just because it's all veggie food.  2. The atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes the music is a little loud, but it's definitely not as bad as a lot of other places around The Valley.  3. Take Out! This is one of my favorite places to grab food after roller derby practice! It's quick, healthy, and filling.  4. I have a lot of friends that eat meat. Not one of them has said anything negative about the food here. Plus, the people here don't look down on meat-eaters. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when vegetarian extremists think lowly of people that eat meat--you're giving a bad name to us other vegetarians! Calm down!   5. It's affordable. Yes! Affordable vegetarian food! Amazing, right?!  6. Have a Tsoynami. No, really. Trust me.  Personally, I think the food tastes better at this location than the 7th Street location. And, as mentioned earlier, there have been a couple of staff members that have been...well...rather rude. But they don't work here anymore, as far as I can tell. There's always a rotten apple, right? Except for the food. Nothing rotten about the food.  Go here! Every day!",

You could bring just about any carnivore here and I think they'd walk away happy.  I know I did  Was pretty disappointed with the Samosas though (pic).  Pretty, and they tasted fine, but I thought skimpy at $4.50  The place definitely has a bit of a California vibe, with a good eclectic mix of music.  Lunch is definitely busy, but the food comes out fast and staff make sure you're taken care of.",

We both loved the hummus, super fresh with a little kick. The chips it comes with were yummy, not heavy at all. The spinach dip was weird, almost had a chemical flavor to it, we wouldn't order that again. The animal fries were naughty, in the best possible way. We will definitely be back, for some healthier fair. Service was friendly, like you were eating over at a friends house. The decor and music is \"old Mill avenue\", chill, hip and fun.",

    "text": "Ah, what more can be said about this little slice of Heaven in North Tempe? Well, let me offer something from a new perspective: I am a conservative Republican Catholic and I love Green!  I often like to come here after work. It is right in the middle of my 2.2 mile commute, and so I can easily walk here, eat, and walk to the next bus stop. So if you see me in my work uniform - I work at a Catholic parish - you will know that I think it is worth the walk.  I especially enjoy coming here on Fridays, when I abstain from meat. Now I could be somewhere eating seafood or dairy or eggs, but I choose Green because the food is just that good. My motto? \"Hippies have the best food!\" Restaurants usually try to be apolitical. The key to a good restaurant is mostly in not offending anyone's ideologies. Green's decor and ambiance is clearly quirky and off-beat and appeals mostly to young hipsters, but you can tell that the only politics important here are kindness to animals and care for the environment. I can get behind these things!  I have been here many times now. It is becoming even more of a regular thing as I get used to the three-block walk in between buses. I have tried various dishes and they're all fantastic. Some of the best are the Lemon Pesto Bowl and the Chili Fries with \"Cheese\". I have also had Edamame, Samosas, and No Harm Chicken Parm, all great. Once I had a mock burger that was weird and would've been sub-standard even for Jack in the Box. But I'm happy to ignore the outliers when the rest is delish. Lately I have quite enjoyed my share of Vanilla Almond Milk Shakes. I am sure these have more than a few calories but it's definitely a refreshing treat on a hot day. And the portion isn't huge, so I don't feel that guilty about indulging.  The price is right! Everything is so reasonable, and the servers are super-friendly and nice. An especially nice feature is a big fridge full of interesting drinks, none of which I've ever tried, not to mention the fresh-mixed juices and ades on the counter. Also there is an impulse-buy set of shelves for things to take home, all of which are full of vegetarian goodness.  If you're in doubt about what to get, try my favorite. The Lemon Pesto Bowl with House Tofu and Brown Rice. You really can't go wrong. The walnuts in here are a special treat. Plenty of mixed veggies in a delectable tart lemon sauce. I like to break out the chopsticks for this one. Also, don't miss the Tsoynamis, a soft-serve treat that is also refreshing on a hot day. I tried one once and it was wonderful. But being on a diet, I shy away from sugary creamy frozen treats as a matter of course. It's not for me but perhaps it is for you!  I am known for my ability to eat just about anywhere a bus stops. I adamantly refuse to go out of my way to eat - that's why when I'm at home on my day off, I am likely to order delivery food or, in a pinch, I might walk one block to a restaurant. Green is so conveniently placed on my commute, and so delicious, that it has rightly taken its place among my regular hangouts. And I am proud to recommend them to other conservatives. Don't let your politics keep you away from really great food!",

    "text": "If I knew vegan food was this fantastic, I'd totally convert and be a Vegan. I recently went to Green out in South Scottsdale and I have been trying to eat my way through the menu.   For their starters, I've tried the samosa, the chili fries, the egg rolls and \"wings.\" Out of those, I'd say my favorites have been the wings. If you didn't know they were mock meat, I'd still think they were just like boneless pieces of chicken cause the sauce with the wings was fantastic. And the chili fries were fantastic! I usually get the chili on the side to avoid making the thyme fries too soggy.   I've only done two of the bowls - the drunken mushroom chicken and the diablo red with mock beef. The two bowls were seasoned fantastically and yummy. I do need to try more bowls. I've tried more of the sammies and burgers. The original \"g\"spicy po-boy is fantastic, but I may be biased since I really loved the wings and that's what they put in this po-boy lol. I tried their no-harm parm chicken sandwich, but wasn't that big of a fan of it, but it was because my mock chicken patty and its breading was coming off and apart due to the tomato sauce so it wasn't enjoyable. My favorite by far was the Mexicali burger; it's a fantastic, slightly spicy, mouthful. As I've said, I'm trying to eat my way through the menu, but I couldn't pass up having another mexicali burger again lol.   The tSoynamis, their ice cream dream desserts, are a simplistic tasty orgasmic mouthful. The have specialty ones featured off their usual menu; I love their recent one with the butterfingers. It's so yummy and makes me want a butterfinger lol. Their Soy Captain tSoynami makes me want Captain Crunch. Their Cookies 'n' Cream and Ts'more tSoynami is yummy as well. The Cookies 'n' Cream one is a chocolatey heaven. They have an awesome PB&J tSoynami, which is by far my favorite!   I am so going back and making a dent in their menu!",

    "text": "3/17/10  I know it's been awhile since I was last here, although not quite as long as sixteen months!  I see that the decor has changed yet again-- last time major add I knew of was the painted poetry on the wall next to the restroom.  There are now car door cutouts-as-art lining two walls near the front of the resto, along w/ a couch, or two.  Eclectic, and a nice add to the vibe that Green already exudes.    Tried the crab puffs again (it's been awhile since I last had them).  Wished I didn't.  Don't know if it's the ingredients in the vegan cream cheese (it contains corn/derivatives), or the fact that they're deep-fried (not all fried items make me queasy after), or both, but I'm not going to order these again.  I should've just thrown them away, but the crunchiness of the wonton (have I mentioned that I love crunchy-munchy foods?) and the cost of this app, $4 (or $1 a pop), made me plow on.  Never again.  The original \"g\" spicy po-boy made me forget my disappointment, however, as I crunched through the scrumptious mock chicken and its lovely and indeed spicy buffalo sauce!  Three battered buffalo mock chicken patties nestled between tomato slices, arugula, and Green's amazing vegan mayo on a toasted vegan hoagie roll, along w/ a side of thyme fries... Mmm... a must-try!  Seeing others enjoying their tsoynami sundaes made me want to get one myself, so after some deliberation, I decided on one of the daily specials- Death by Chocolate: vanilla soy ice cream w/ vegan brownie chunks, Newman's Own chocolate wafer crumbles, and vegan chocolate syrup.  Undeniably choco-licious, but something was amiss... I believe I was wishing for a colder sensation that regular ice cream offers and that soy ice cream cannot deliver.  It wasn't a warm day, and the tsoynami sundae that was delivered to me already had that sheen that regular ice cream develops when it's allowed to sit around and melt.  Don't get me wrong- it's the combination of cold/ solid and slightly melted and slippery that makes a frozen dessert a success for me, but tsoynamis generally make me wish I'd saved the calories and visit a gelateria, instead.  Which, as a non-vegan, I will.  Next time.    While the app and dessert left me wishing I didn't indulge, the \"g\" spicy po-boy indubitably made my tastebuds sing.  I'll just have to stick w/ the artichoke gratine and say sayonara to tsoynami in the future.  Don't the photos look divine, though?",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so much more than I actually did. I've gone to Green on several occasions and have tried something different every time (in hopes that I'll actually find something I truly like).   Nope. Didn't really happen, unfortunately, which makes me so so sad.  Pros:  Major props to the designer/decorator. I do like the concept of the place--most of the decorations/furniture seemed to be refurbished or recycled items. Can't complain about how creative and \"green\" the place is! Also, I like their concept of the tSoynami (soy-based ice-cream sundae mixed in with all sorts of candies/cereals/syrups/etc. of your choice. There's a million different pre-made combos you can choose from, but I'm sure you can customize your own as well.   Cons:  I'm just really underwhelmed with the main entrees and dishes. Perhaps I went in with too high of expectations? Out of the Bowls section of the menu, I've tried Singapore Orange, Thai Peaunut, and Drunken Mongolian. Honestly, I thought they all tasted the same. The flavors were heavily soy-sauce based (which is fine...I grew up eating lots of soy-sauce based dishes), but I really couldn't tell the difference between the three. I've also tried the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy and the Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\" form the menu as well. These were decent, but were super super high-in-sodium-tasting if you know what I mean.  Granted, I'm also a fan of meat, so vegetarian shops like Green may not be my greatest area of expertise. My comments, truly,  are more targeted towards the flavor combos and balances of the dishes here.   Overall, I like the concept of Green. If a vegetarian/vegan friend was in town for a week, I would probably bring him/her to Green to check the place out. Personally, though, I'm not sure I would crave Green enough to visit again on my own.",

If I had not looked it up prior to going, we would have never found it as it is in a small strip mall not close to the downtown area.

    "text": "Wait until the end, this gets good. I usually eat at the Green in Phoenix and get great food and service. I came to this location last night, Friday, June 14 at about 8 o'clock and had a bad experience. The young, cute boy who took my order was attentive and kind and gave great service. When my food came out, only half of it came out. I waited 20 min before I told a girl who was bringing out food that I never got the other half of my order. She just said \"ok\" and went back into the kitchen and I was assuming she was checking for my food but I never saw her again. 15 minutes later another girl came to take my number away from my table so I told her that actually, I never got the rest of my food. She didn't seem to even believe me and walked back into the kitchen. Maybe 10 min later, they brought the rest of it out. Before leaving, I went to use the bathroom. I'm sitting on the toilet when I hear a knock at the door so I shout \"occupied!\" but to my horror I see the lock on the door UNLOCK and the door begins to be very slowly pushed open from someone on the other side of it. I'm still on the toilet and I'm shouting, \"I'm in here! I'm in here! I'm in here! I'M IN HERE I'M IN HERE I'M IN HERE!!\" hoping that whoever unlocked the door and is opening it will stop opening it. I have no idea why they aren't listening to me until the door is wide open, exposing me to the restaurant, and I see it was a female employee with headphones in her ears BLASTING music so loud there was never a chance of her hearing me pleading to her to stop opening the door. My question is, why even knock if you're not going to listen for an answer? I was plenty loud. I didn't get a single apology my entire time there between not getting the food I paid for and being non-consensually exposed on the toilet to the restaurant. If I had gotten an apology I don't think I would have felt the need to write this review. Step it up, Green. Do better.",

I also tried the brautwurst on special and I enjoyed it, but found the amount of mustard was a bit overwhelming. The buffalo bites are SO good! The fries are thin and crispy deliciousness! Last visit we got the Santa Monica burger and it was amazing! Right amounts of everything!!!!! Tsoynaumi* was also great! We will definitely be back, working our way through the menu. A little expensive, but worth the treat in yo face! Vegan food for the win! Nomnomnom",

The fries were too thin, so they got soggy pretty fast. The flavor was okay as well. I would order them again, just wouldn't pour the chilli cheese on the fries and instead I would dip them.  The Chicago cheesesteak wasn't that great. The meat substitute had no flavor although the onion and bell pepper were cooked perfectly.  Now the bff was amazing. It is the reason for the 4 stars. The \"chicken\" was soft and had a overall wonderful flavor.  We were only in Tempe a few days, but if we go back, we will make sure to stop by again even if it is just to get the bff.",

My personal favorite is the BFF which has some great toppings. The first time I went I had the secret bbq sammie which was also amazing but a little messy. I really love sandwiches but I recently got the Ranchero salad  which was also good and much more filling than I expected. I cannot stop going back there and every time it's a struggle to pick just one thing to try! It's basically a vegan paradise and if you don't eat meat you need to check it out!   I originally went to the location in downtown phoenix before moving to Tempe and they are similar and the food is exactly the same. The Downtown location has a much different more artsy vibe and feels a little smaller. I do not love the Tempe locations outdoor seating because it's just a patio with a view of a parking lot and street.",

    "text": "Let me start off by informing you that I have been vegan for 15 years and have a couple of vegan kids. I am over all of the healthy vegan trendy foods. In my humble opinion, it takes a near act of God to make quinoa taste like food that a non-ancient Inca would enjoy. The same goes for acai, or as I like to call it \"dirt fruit.\" Part of the reason that I choose to be vegan is health, but another part is because I enjoy eating good food.   The reason that I give Green five stars is because they make tasty, straight forward vegan grub. It's not pretentious, nor does it get too adventurous for its own good. I don't live close by, but every time we come to spring training (What? A vegan baseball fan? I thought they were all hippies. Are you sure it isn't practice for burning man?) I make an effort to eat here.   I'm used to having one or two choices from a menu, and it's always a little overwhelming to have so many choices. I asked the cashier what they recommended and she directed me to the item voted \"best faux chicken sandwich in the US\" by VegNews, the Secret BBQ Chicken. She did not steer me wrong- it was great. My 6 year old wanted the peanut sauce noodle bowl, but it was too spicy for his sensitive, young palate. When I told the woman up front (after avoiding the long, Saturday dinner line) she said that it was no problem, and gave us a No Harm Chicken Parm sandwich for my son, who loved it. I offered to pay and she refused. Right there, she made a customer for life. You should be too.  After all this, I didn't get one of the fantastic looking Soy-Nami deserts. What a mean dad.  I'm happy to see Green doing so well in a location that requires its diners to seek it out. Your mouth and your conscience will be satiated with every meal.",

    "text": "Love. This. Place.  Maybe it's because vegetarians are high and dry in the desert to find someplace to eat.  But I really think the food is good. I've had the green burger, thyme fries, curry pasta salad, several of the bowls, 4 different kinds of tsoynamis, a peanut butter chocolate bar, a strawberry milkshake, and a mooshroom po' boy. All good.  The po' boy was a little hard to eat - very messy, but tasty nonetheless (it's supposed to be messy, right?). The burger is a reddish color (they must use beet juice) and tastes like grains and savoriness and is texturally soft and pleasing, on a nice big bun with all the right fixins. Thyme fries could use a little more thyme, but the fries themselves were quite good. Tsoynamis and milkshakes are AMAZING. Bowls with noodles and fried tofu are great. Thai peanut = win.  It has a nice, diverse menu - can't wait to try out some of the appetizers :)  One thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of \"fake meat\" on the menu - fake chicken, fake beef, etc. I'm not into the fake meat so much, give me something homemade or tofu any day. Fortunately, there was plenty of that too, and some people like fake meat, so who am I to judge?  Star for really friendly staff, star for delicious ice cream, star for fabulous mostly-from-scratch vegan food, star for having so many things to choose from, and star for carrying Maine root beer!!! AAAH MY FAVORITE!",

    "text": "... Apologies, I was just daydreaming about the Green Burger.  If I could suggest to a meat-eater a place for them to experiment with eating like a veg, no doubt this would be the place.  If I could suggest to a veg a place to have a mouth-gasm, no doubt this would be the place.  Ok, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk food. They have delicious salads, and was look like good personal-pan style pizzas. I'm a fan of the huge, size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion, so I've never gone that route at Green.  Regardless, I would be willing to slap a $5 down on the table in front of someone at Green, and if they didn't like the food, they could take it and walk.  Their tofu/mock-chicken/mock-beef/mock-pork bowls are yum, yum, yum. I stick with the Singapore tofu, and it never fails to make my stomach smile.  And their tsoynamis are oh-so good. No, that's not a mistake, people. It's a soy Dairy-Queen-blizzard style cup full of sunshine. EVERY one I've tried has blown me away. Some I like better, but I can't judge. It's sweet. It's soy. It's goooood.  Sometimes when it's lunch time, or a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place can get packed. It's usually full of the hipster and indie kinds of people, but, that shouldn't in any way make you not want to eat there, especially if you don't look this way. Eff all of that, go for the food if nothing else.  Service is always spot on, and they're always keen to help you decide or answer questions.  If you want a good, entertaining view of all the fixie-riders (there's a bike shop next door, no lies!), albeit simply amazing food, I'm going to say go here.  P.s. The ladies bathroom has a cool piece of artwork hanging on the wall and an even cooler faucet fixture for the sink. P.p.s. The artwork in this place is beyond bitchin'.",

Visited at night on a weekday. It was fairly full.  I ordered the jerk tofu salad to go. I really enjoyed the taste of the dressing and the flavor it infused in the tofu. The only thing I found odd was the following:  It seems they are interested in reducing waste and polution. they packaged  my salad in cardboard packaging instead of styrofoam,they provided a wood fork  (which shows they are onboard witht reducing waste and care for the environment) but they put it all in a plastic bag. (I guess the SurfRider foundation rise against plastics campaign has not reached Tempe yet). Overall good change of pace",

    "text": "I was introduced to Green last December when they catered a Lucky Dog Rescue silent auction. I can still remember my first encounter - the buffalo wings and dipping sauce. I thought I heard someone mention that it was vegan. No, there's no way a chicken wing could be vegan. But then I heard it again- everything is vegan. You might say that I loaded up on those little buffalo wings, but who could blame me! There's a reason they've won awards... they're amazing! Next, I tried the mock chicken skewers that were smothered in green's original espresso barbecue sauce. I have to say that Green has really nailed the mock meat. The texture, flavor and taste are so authentic that sometimes I find myself second guessing the mock in the meat.  It's no surprise that off of their regular menu, my favorites are the buffalo chicken sandwich and the barbecue chicken sandwich. I also order a plate of the buffalo wings as an appetizer every time I stop in. Their pasta bowls are also really good, and their mock meatballs are pretty delicious. My only less than stellar experience at Green was when I ordered the Mexi-Cali burger. I'm not sure what the patty was made of, but it was red, and I wasn't really into the flavor. But the thyme shoe string fries rescued the meal and my tummy.  The lemon-aide and lime-aide are also delicious, and I would recommend giving them a shot if you're generally a cola-junkie.  One last tip would be to get there early on Saturday nights as they get pretty busy and you might be hard pressed to find an open table.",

I also tried the soy ice-cream the last time I went and I fell in love. I definitely recommend you try it.   They also have a small little market by the cash wrap with cheese less mac n' cheese, vegan chocolate bars and other sweet things I haven't found at other stores.   I also like the laid back earthy atmosphere and the people that eat here are pretty cool too.  Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's a little expensive. But it's worth it on occasion.",

The Green burger is phenomenal too! It's always busy, but well worth the wait. We have never had anything there that wasn't good. Very affordable too. My kids & I are vegetarian while my husband is vegan and this place satisfys us all. This place is a quality vegetarian place & they like to be eco-friendly & green... added bonus as far as I am concerned.

I will say the wait is crazy when they get busy and it's annoying having to wait for people to get up so you can sit down.... We were nice to offer part of our table to another couple that was looking for a seat, but I guess our table was tiny. Luckily it planted a seed and another couple offered them a place at their table that was bigger.   Besides the seating and the wait for the food, there was so much that we wanted to try! The spicy edamame was great! I ordered the Curry noodles, they were nice and a great portion! My boyfriend ordered the fake CHicken Parm Sandwich... he liked it and had no complaints. I would highly recommend that you try the fake buffalo wings, they were so damn tasty that we tried to venture back to get another fix before we headed to airport, sadly they were closed ! :(",

How do they make beans / soy taste like the most perfect piece of chicken I have ever had - I am unsure.  The best thing I think I had had, was a special. It was mock duck done in a french style - called \"the donald.\" I am a huge duck fan - and this did not disappoint. I strongly recommend you try this place, and go back often to try new dishes.

But I have one bone to pick with the menu (is that a bad phrase to use for a vegetarian restaurant?): it needs more selections that truly celebrate the vegetable. Almost everything available is mock beef, fake chicken and faux pork. That's fine, I guess, especially for recent vegetarian meat-eaters who are missing some of the old textures and flavors. But for long-time veggies - and even for carnivores like me looking for variety - the menu could stand to have a few more dishes celebrating beans and mushrooms and soy and all the other incredible flora that are just fine being themselves and not pretending to be flesh.  It's better that way - and, let's face it, that veggie burger is never going to taste as good as the real burger if that's what you are really after.",

Green uses organic ingredients \"whenever possible\" as stated on their menu. This place is pretty much a vegan's guilty pleasure.   Orecciette Pasta The chips looking things they gave me with my pasta was pretty good. The tomato sauce ...I didn't like it. The vegetables were chunky and weren't cut good ..but that probably doesn't matter to a lot of people, I just like my veggies cut nicely.  The little earlobe pastas were good. The mock breaded chicken ...normal.   Atmosphere This place has a casual artistic atmosphere. They have flyers supporting locals around and they also have Java magazine for anyone to look at and take.   Employees Nice, happy employees. I just found it a bit weird that she got a bit tense and hesitant when I asked her about the food like she was afraid I was going to ask about the healthy stuff of the ingredients or something.   It was worth a first time visit just to satisfy my curiosity but I won't be coming here to eat healthy. Seems like the place for vegans to go if they have occasional unhealthy cravings.",

They have quite a few choices on the menu, much of which is made with mock chicken or beef. You can also get crispy tofu or fresh tofu in most anything too.  You order at the counter, and the staff is super friendly. We got the samosas for an appetizer.  They were pretty tasty, although a little mushy inside.  The sauce they came with was delish.   Although there are tasty looking bowls and pasta on the menu, I got the Original \"g\" po' boy and my boyfriend got the Mum's meatball po'boy.  Mine was sooo good and really spicy.  The sauce on the mock chicken was awesome and the thyme fries are delicious.  My boyfriend loved his too, and the few bites I had of his sandwich were definitely enjoyable. He got the curry pasta salad with his and really liked it.   We decided to try out a Soynami too- which is soy ice cream mixed with organic ingredients.  We chose the Newman's chocolate cookies with chocolate sauce.  Really good.   The food was great, and the best part is that it's super cheap.  Our sandwiches were only $6.50.  That's crazy! Our app was $3.50- even crazier!  I talked with one of the employees and he told me that they have plans to get a liquor license and once that happens, they will become a full service restaurant.   The decor of the place is pretty cool too.  They have artwork lining the walls, including one titled \"Penis bites man.\"  Hmm.  I really liked their lighting- it gave the place an intimate feel.   I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone and everyone- not just vegetarians.",

Here you can find inventive takes on veghead staples such as salads and Thai-inspired noodle dishes to daring vegan versions of chili fries and hot wings (made from mushroom stems) that prove worthy rivals to the animal-involved originals. The bistro features a varied menu, bolstered by specials that change daily. Green also features a handful of prepackaged vegan specialty foods, including gelatin-free marshmallows.  Perhaps what I like best about Green is its hip, progressive vibe that has not fallen victim to the snotty hipster nonsense so prevalent in The Valley's \"cool\" restaurants.

    "text": "I love this place and I'm not even Vegan. Though, after eating at GREEN, I'm seriously considering Vegetarianism.  Problem is: I'm a creature of habit. When I find a meal I like, I just reorder it over and over. (note to self: change that!)  My meal of choice at Green is the Mongolian Noodle Bowl w/the mock chicken, which is to die for. The veggies are fresh & flavorful and the mock chicken is absolutely delicious.   Equally as satisfying is the Soynami, frozen vegan ice \"cream\" delight and the Peanut butter thingy.  I do wish they had more drink choices.   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd like to see them use whole wheat noodles and Organic. But really, that's minor. Cause like the other review mentions, their other restaurant \"That's a Wrap\" in Phoenix has healthier fare.  For the conscientious greenie, GREEN lives up to their name in more ways than one! The floors are concrete, the tables are made from sustainable materials (is that sorghum?) and they are definitely saving energy with what appears to be a swamp cooler. Not overly cooling on a hot Arizona afternoon but energy efficient.  Green is hands down my favorite Arizona restaurant and I've been here for 8 years. Arizona definitely needs more of these type restaurants.  The downside? They're about 40 or more miles away from my home. But with the food quality, relaxed atmosphere and Green interior, it's worth the trek for me.",

    "text": "This is the kind of place that could turn a carnivore into a vegetarian.  I have always been very resistant to soy products and any form of faux meat.  It just always seemed so gross to me.  Due to a recent change in my lifestyle to be healthier, I have looked into healthier alternatives including what I used to turn my nose up at.  We saw a demonstration at Devoured by Chef Damon where he turned some of the weirdest ingredients (to me) into a beautiful yummy dish.  I had to see what else he had to offer.  First of all, the place is nothing like I expected.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something along the lines of True Food Kitchen.  Instead, it felt like a mess hall at some weird Liberal Arts school, and I say all that in a good way.  It's an order and pay at the counter then wait for your food at a table ordeal, which normally is fine by me.  Unfortunately the girl who had our food never bothered to call out the name we gave and instead walked around casually asking people who she thought might have ordered our dishes if it was theirs.  Finally she made her way to us after about five minutes.  That was annoying.  Forget about that though, because the food is good enough to make up for that little mishap.  (Other staff members seemed to call out names perfectly fine, just not that one.)  I ordered the Drunken Mushroom Chicken and grabbed an Oogave soda out of the cooler for my dinner.  The soda was great, and you can buy them at Sprouts, awesome.  The \"Chicken\" was expertly crafted with a texture almost identical to chicken and a taste just as close.  The breading around it was yummy, slightly crunchy, and a tiny bit sweet.  My bowl was packed full of delicious fresh veggies and loads of mushrooms.  There was also a generous helping of rice noodles buried in there too.  It was all fantastic, and I would eat it every night if I could.  i will most certainly be back to Green to try everything else on their menu.  Everything looks so good!  When it's actually good for you too, you just can't resist!",

    "text": "FOOD: I am not a vegetarian or vegan, so maybe I do not have the mindset to appreciate this place. Establishing a vegetarian restaurant is a good idea, there are plenty of vegetarians. But why is everything on their menu a mock of regular, meaty foods? Damn it, if I'm going out to eat vegan, I want dishes with REAL veggie dishes proud of being vegan, not this mock meat/cheese crap. It's like the restaurant is saying, \"We are vegen and we know it sucks, so we're gonna try to re-create all your favorite meat dishes!\" No thanks, I know there are good vegetarian dishes out there and if I want a pizza, I'll get a real pizza with real cheese! I guess this place is marketing solely to vegetarians and not regular omnivores. The pizza was horrible, and the ice cream was not the best I've had. Not good vegetarian food!  PRICE: Way too expensive for what you get. I don't remember the exact prices, but I remember questioning myself, \"Why did I pay that much for this? It has no high-priced meat in it!\"   ATMOSPHERE: Laid back place perfect for a college crowd. Easily sits large groups.   SKINNY: If you want vegetarian food, my suggestion is to get Muslim or Indian veggie dishes. They are actually tasty. GREEN offers some self-ashamed vegan cuisine that only reminds you h ow much you enjoy meat and cheese.",

I had the chicken salad with miso dressing which was really tasty and a small bowl was plenty for me. She had the mexicali burger which came with fruit and we shared chili fries.

    "text": "Hubby has been eating mostly vegetarian lately, so we decided to check out Green. I don't think we'll go back.   Everything we ate, we could get better elsewhere. Hubby's pad-thai-ish dish was pretty good, with noodles, a zippy sauce, and big crunchy veggies. All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots. Maybe it's just me, but I like some texture and identifiable ingredients in my egg rolls. They were also weirdly spiced and arrived without the dipping sauce advertised in the menu. The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters. He didn't seem to care that we thought they were bad- he just shrugged and said, \"Well SOME people don't like them.\" Well, I guess we're SOME people then. We also tried the much praised pseudo crab puffs, and they were pretty good, especially with the dipping sauce that managed to come out with this plate. Hubby also had to have the soy \"blizzard\". He liked it, and I thought the taste was fine initially, but then had an aftertaste I didn't care for.   The atmosphere is clearly meant for hipster youngsters. The lighting was so low that I literally had a hard time reading the white on black menu. Seriously, Green. Have some consideration for your clientele over 20.   The last thing that left a negative impression was some of the staff. As we finished our meal, they were starting to close. Hubby went up to the counter to order his soy \"blizzard\" and the too-cool-for-the-rest-of-us young man behind the counter had to ask a co-worker if they were still making them. Um, if you still have customers in the restaurant, I would imagine you should still be making them. It's not like we were in there for a half hour past closing, and there were still many customers in the place.   One last observation: what's up with all the vegetarian and vegan smokers clogging the entrance? God forbid there be any animal products in your bodies, but bring on the tar and chemicals!?! As someone who quit smoking after many years, I would appreciate it if Green would insist that their customers observe the keep-it-20-feet-from-the-entrance ordinance.",

And several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes (hot dogs, burgers, chicken, etc.). I know that right there either turns people on or off. Me, I dig it. My freezer's stocked with Boca, Morning Star, Quorn and Gardenburger products. That said, not all of their mock products work. While I love heir Spicy Buffalo Wings, Crab Puffs, Vegan Chili Fries and Mum's Meatball Po-boy, I was disappointed with the No Harm Chicken Parm Sandwich and the Vegan Hot Dogs. Haven't built up the courage to try their pizzas just yet - my previous experience with vegan cheese hasn't been all that great. But I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually, I stop by for lunch with my meat-eating friends at least once a month. But don't worry, mock isn't all they have to offer. They've also got tofu - a Spicy Peanut Tofu appetizer as well as a good variety of noodle and rice bowls.  And it's a pretty cool place - I really dig the decor, from the Volkswagen doors along an entire wall to the local art work.",

    "text": "Well, I fell into the classic trap. Let me warn you:  VEGAN DOES NOT MEAN HEALTHY  Sure, a vegan diet can be healthier than a meat diet, depending on whose advice you're following. Fried starches are vegan, sugar is vegan, overly- processed chemical meat substitutes are vegan... you get the idea.  That being said, this place is tasty. They offer a substantial and varied menu to appeal to the masses while maintaining a no-harm attitude. Even the to-go containers are eco-friendly. I had the Thai peanut bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. I don't usually go for the fake n' bake, but I was persuaded. This was convincing, but I would probably go for the tofu next tme. The sauce was delicious and the dish was satisfying, the veggie to chicken ratio was impressive (lots of both). Hubsky ordered thee Argentine po-boy, a fake steak sandwich with caremelized peppers and onions with vegan mayo and chimichuri sauce. He found that satidfying. I tasted it for reviewing purposes, and I have to say that it was spicy and tasty, but again, I prefer tofu or veggies to fake meat. They did a great job of approximating the texture of steak with the seitan, but the immitation was of a fattier cut of steak. I would have preferred a chewier texture \"well-done\" texture. I packed up half my dish to leave room for the much touted Tsoynami. It lived up to its reputation. The varieties available can be overwhelming. I had a Newman's Own chocolate mint thing, but I would probably go for something completely chocolate next time. The mint was too sweet for me. It should also be noted that there were oatmeal cream cookie sandwiches that I did not try but have been thinking about since my visit... three weeks ago.",

A few weeks ago my friend Mike a fellow Chicagoan took me there for lunch.  I'm hooked.  Been back two times in a week and a half.  Forget about it being vegan.  Green is just a good restaurant.  I have tried the Argentine sandwich, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Teriyaki chicken, chili cheese fries and more.  Everything tastes great!  The prices are reasonable and the service is fast and friendly!   I love the decor, it has an earthy hippie vibe.   My favorite thing at Green is the the Soynami,  it is their version of  a Dairy Queen Blizzard!",

I usually have the no harm chicken parm, which is delicious.  I think I've tried about half of the sandwiches on the menu and while they are all tasty, none compare to the no harm.  From the appetizers, I've had the crab cakes, which are interesting, but I wouldn't feel compelled to order them regularly.  I've also had the artichoke dip, which i think is fantastic.  I've had a number of the soynamis as well and they are a wonderful treat.  Pick from the already creative menu or create your own.  My girlfriend went to Phoenix last month and brought back a no harm chicken parm on the plane for me.  It was the best surprise!",

But the real thing isn't even close to tasting like real meat either, so the flavorless tofu patties didn't have to accomplish much. It was very large and falling apart, so I had to toss the middle bun to eat it. I was impressed with their dairy-free thousand island, not too shabby. Their thyme fries were great. Dropped a couple of stars because the food wasn't fantastic, and the girl behind the counter wasn't friendly.",

I try to order a different item every time I go and so far I have not been disappointed. My favorite meal has been the po boy mock chicken sandwich with thyme fries. The crab puffs are also amazing. The food is filling yet light, doesn't sit in your stomach for the rest of the day, and I always feel satisfied. The hang out, casual feel of the restaurant is enjoyable and the employees are very friendly willing to offer suggestions. They also have really cool art on around the restaurant. As a vegan this restaurant is a haven for me and I recommend it to fellow vegans and meat-eaters alike! My family has vegetarians and nonveg and we all enjoy coming here. The ice cream, tsoynamis, are my favorite dessert of all time. You can get soft serve or a full sized tsoynami which have different mix ins. Cookie dough, chocolate cake, and pie are just a few of their mix ins.",

    "text": "Even for meat eaters, Green has a lot to love. A lot more than just tofu! I go here at least a couple times a month for lunch and it's spectacular 95% of the time. A few of our favorite items are the BBQ \"Chicken\" sandwich, Thee Argentine sandwich, the crab puffs and of course, the Tsoynamis. Everything is fairly priced ($8 for a sandwich, $7.50 for a bowl w/ your choice or rice or noodles). The only thing I don't particularly care for is the buffalo wings as I think they are far too salty. The ranch that it comes with is fantastic, though. Also, if you get something with cheese make sure to use Daiya instead of Teese. Daiya tastes much better, in my opinion.  The atmosphere is very artsy. There are always paintings for sale and there are a bunch of old car doors and hub caps over to one side. They just got a few booths which is fantastic if you want a little privacy. There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.  Another great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.  Another thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving. They will load you up will all sorts of delicious and traditional Thankgsiving day food, veganized. \"Turkey\", stuffing, biscuits, brussels sprouts, asparagus, cranberry sauce, gravy, corn, pie and a drink. You'll get guest speakers, live music and local arts and crafts. Highly recommend.",

Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend.  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken.  It was quite satisfying  It's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you.

    "text": "I agree with Monica J's review. My wife and I sought out Green while vacationing in Phoenix. We seek out healthy and real food places to eat everywhere we go. While Green's offerings are substantially healthier, they use a lot of sugar/sweeteners in their menu. Some items are rather small for the price. I had their special of the day which was street tacos. 3 small tacos with not a lot of anything in them. If they had filled them with a bit more cabbage and thrown some fresh salsa on them, they would have appeared larger and less like airplane food. The tacos came with a side of fries. Interested in how they did their meatless chili, I ordered them with some of their chili on top. While the fries were cold and not very fresh, the chili was to die for! The rice bowls that other customers ordered looked very substantial and appealing, probably the better choice for next time. We tried a couple of the tofu soft serve for desert. Interesting and a great substitute for ice cream, but still loaded with sugar. I too would like to be able to see the actual ingredients and nutritional values for their menu items. But, I imagine that they wouldn't be much healthier than other fast foods.   So, for a vegetarian or vegan alternative, I'd give them 5 stars. For a \"real food\", low carb, or sugar free choice, 2 stars. For the amount you get vs. the price you pay on some of their menu items, 2 stars. The atmosphere and service levels were great. I'd score them 5 stars here, but the \"Homiez\" artwork was weird and didn't fit with the rest of the motif, so 4 stars.",

The first two times I ordered takeout and they completely ruined my order, so the third time I decided to eat there and see if that made a difference. I am allergic to peppers and told the cashier this when ordering he assured me there would be none and I got my food and was about to take a big bite into the sand which when I see peppers. I told the staff and they were very kind and then said they would make me a new one. A few minutes pass and they bring my plate, set it down, walk away really quickly, I look at my plate and they still put peppers on my plate. THIS IS AN ALLERGY so I had to ask them to make a new one to go, they are very frustrated at me, and I get home to take a bite into a pepper. So basically I waited 2 hours to still get hives.",

Now do not be put off by their food selection. Yes it is all Fake Meat. Yes it is all vegan. No it does not taste like cardboard. Yes you will love this and feel bad about liking meat and go into a moral dilemma. Don't worry grab a vegan cookie and you will feel even better/worse. Just Kidding.  I have enjoyed every single thing I have had on their menu.. and their desserts are really good. I always question if the meat is real or not.. because it is super tasty.. and the flavors just pop in all of their bowls.",

You would think with being all vegan they would have something that wasn't cooked in oil outside of the salad. The cashier said she would have them cook it with no oil. I take a bite only to have oily sauce come pouring out the backside. If this was a no oil sandwich I would hate to see what a normal one looked like. Regardless I don't think they actually were concerned with my issues eating oils and could have just made it like normal. I got the chili as a side. It was awful!! It tasted like meatless crumbles with taco seasoning on them. I took two bites and left it.  My boyfriend got their burger which was pretty good (I snuck a bite) with thyme fries which had no seasoned taste whatsoever. Very bland!!!  For a $30 lunch I am beyond disappointed!!!!",

I have attended their ThanksLiving event for the last two years and have a great time enjoying delicious fake turkey (made from seiten and breaded), side dishes, and yummy desserts. Plus, the proceeds go to the Humane Society.    Besides ThanksLiving, this place has faux meat down! Many of my meat-eating friends say that the fake meat is just as delicious with a very similar mouthfeel as the meat they're imitating.  I have ordered salads, stir-fries, and the desserts here and have loved everything.  The stir fry vegetables are cooked to perfection - not too overcooked and crispy but not too raw still. The place can get packed on weekends and evenings, though, so sometimes finding a table can be a problem.  If one chooses an off time, it's usually no problem.   Besides the slowish service, I haven't been superimpressed with the cashiers.",

Last time I ask some Nachos at the location on Phoenix and literally they were full of grease. I end up throwing half of the nachos. Also, when you ask for a bowl, you get rice, 3 or 4 pieces of mock chicken or beef and tons of carrots and broccoli. They have been removing some dishes and deserts that were very good. Alfredo's bowl and also the soynami monsoon. Hope some day they get back with the quality that everybody expects. Last thing, most of the people that goes over there ask for a burger, I guess it is the best way to substitute McDonalds and burger king, but again you have too  start measuring the grease. We asked a BFF last week and my wife had to remove the crust. It was wet in grease",

    "text": "Green New American is one of the best vegan places I have tried!  The layout of the restaurant is simple with a slight hipster vibe. You seat yourself and can choose between a table or a booth. Even when this place is busy the wait is never too long. Costumers are able to grab an easy to read menu and decide what they want before they reach the cash register which makes the line go by faster. After the cashier takes your order you just find a place to sit until they bring your food out and if you are ordering out they will usually just call your name out but if you are eating in you are given a number to put onto your table. I have never waited more than 15 minutes for my food even on a busy night.  I have been here twice and tried different things each time. The first time I went to Green New American I tried the Chicago Cheesesteak with fries. Since it was my first time eating here I was not sure what to expect. However, when I received my meal in a little brown box I was surprised to see how full the sub was. I took it to go and was so excited to try it. The meal was just a delicious as it looked. You can't even tell that the cheese and meat are vegan. The thyme fries were also just a good. If you gave this to someone who did not know the meal was vegan they would have not been able to tell the difference.  Since I do not live near Green New American the second time I went here I ordered as much as I thought I could eat. I got the big WAC, animal fries, buffalo wings and a chocolate milkshake. I was most excited about the milkshake, it was nice and chocolaty and again you could not tell that there isn't any dairy. The cheeseburger was also delicious! I was shocked how real the 'meat' tasted, the texture and taste were both on point. It was one of the best vegan burgers I have ever tried. Next the animal fries, the cheese and sauce were so good! I just wish there were more in the box because I could not stop eating them. I was bit iffy about the buffalo wings they did not taste bad it just the texture I did not enjoy. However the dill sauce that came with the wings was really good, I was dipping my fries into it. Most vegetarian and vegan restaurants are usually overpriced however all the items here are not!  If I lived closer to Green New American I would probably eat it every day! I would recommend this place to anyone who is vegetarian/vegan and even those who are not. This is a great restaurant to try out if you are in the area. The only thing that would make this restaurant better is if they added one in Scottsdale!",

My prediction: If you blindfolded an animal eater and they took a bite out of a big wac they wouldn't know it was not animal and would comment on how it was the best big mac they've ever had.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the ordering situation could really be improved. There is always a long line with usually only 1 register and that person has to man the phone as well. Also there are not menus before you get to the desk to order so that slows things down more as ppl are still deciding at the register. Lastly, a pick up spot for ppl who phoned in takeout orders is needed.",

    "text": "I should like Green. I have been a vegetarian for over ten years and I really like when I can go to a restaurant and eat whatever I want. I like the concept of Green, but after two tries, I can say with full confidence that I do not like Green.  Atmosphere: I have no problem with the heavy hipster vibe. In fact, it reminds me of home (ATX is a hipster Mecca during South by) and boyfriend and I make jokes about the decor while standing in line. What I dislike is the \"I don't give a damn\" attitude from the staff behind the counter. The first time we went to Green, I asked the guy behind the counter for a recommendation between two items. He scoffed at me: \"I guess if I *had* to pick, I would go with the sweet and sour.\" Wow. The second time, the girl behind the counter could not be bothered to greet us. She was too busy talking to the other girl behind the counter. When she finally saw that we weren't leaving, she took our order as if it was some great inconvenience to her. Sorry, dear. (Don't worry, I will not be back.)   Food: Boyfriend and I hated the food we have gotten here. First time: He ordered the greenza flatbread pizza and I ordered the sweet and sour. The pizza was an inedible mess of waxy \"cheese\", soggy bread, and pesto. He ate two bites and pushed it away. I mostly liked my sweet and sour except for the fact it was drenched in the sweet and sour sauce. (Dear Green, I *like* the taste of vegetables and tofu, you do not have to hide those things from me. Sincerely, Liz) Second time: I ordered the No Harm Chickn Parm. I can say that the bread was good, but it's a bit too hard to mess up bread that you buy from a third party. The chickn was inedible. It tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency. I do not understand how some Yelpers said this was the best mock chicken they have ever eaten. Boca and Morning Star Farms are infinitely better (and cheaper). Boyfriend got the green hummus. He said it was good. Not worth $4, but good. The pita chips were over-fried--almost burnt. Icky.   Other:  1. The drinks are meh at best. All the drinks in the refrigerated case can be bought at Fry's or Whole Foods. Please do not waste your money.    2. There are not enough tables for the amount of people. I guess Green is to be treated like a coffee shop, not a restaurant. Plop down, claim your table, eat some noms, and surf the web. Do not leave for hours! I guess this is nice for some people, but it is impossible to get a table at dinner time. FYI  3. No AC in the \"restaurant\" during the summer. Unacceptable.   TL;DR: Waxy \"cheese\", too much sauce, inedible mock meats. Don't go.",

    "text": "What to say about green. Well it's a pretty awesome place to start.   I've gone there quite a few times now since going vegetarian and my first visit I was shocked on how the foods I use to eat can be mimicked and actually tasted better! Green provides all sorts of different menu items They have rice and noodles bowls with mock meats and tofu, salads, burgers and sandwiches, mini pizzas, and delicious \"Soynamis\" which are their soy based ice cream (delicious) They have specials as well so you may want to follow them on twitter or like them on facebook!  Green  also gives you a selection of side items including fries, tahini coleslaw(a favorite) pasta, etc and many come with the main item as a meal. They also include appetizers including artichoke gratine which was a yummy dip with chips, vegan chilli fries, crab puffs(another favorite!) and \"boneless wings\" with their homemade vegan ranch dressing. The only unfortunate thing is that both times I've had their wings they have been way too salty. So it kind of ruins it.  My fav things to get there, and if you're going there for the first time you must try their sandwiches! I am a huge fan of their secret bbq chickn sandwich. Messy but it is so satisfying and almost creepy on how well it imitates a real chicken sandwich but it's guiltfree and deliciously crafted! This sandwich will not let you down! My boyfriend also got me into the argetine which has a steaky taste mock meat in  a sub-type sandwich that will sure to make your mouth water. I have had one of their noodle bowls with mock beef and sweet and sour flavor but it was not as filling as their sandwiches. Maybe because I didn't think there was enough noodles but they're pretty good!   Now the place itself is pretty hipster. Artsy feel and vibe and many times there will be artwork for sale or art contests going on. It's definately a cool environment they have a couple couches and its a great place to dine in and bring your friends. It's not really a waiter/waitress type thing. You grab a menu in line order what you want at the counter and pay and then they bring it out to you when it's ready. Most the time it's ready rather quickly and you don't have to worry about flagging down a waitress/waiter if you need anything.  Green also hosted I think it was the 3rd annual thankliving last year that I went to for the first time that had a delicious vegan thanksgiving plate that included everything you could imagine for thanksgiving veganized! Delicious! Definitely an event you don't want to miss!  All and all I love this place. Veg comfort food at it's best!! And it's not just for Vegans I swear even if you're not a herbivore you will love green!",

My favs include their buffalo 'chicken' sandwich, apricot miso noodle bowl and 'crab' puffs. I wish I had their recipe for the fake chicken, it is aaaamzing. Servings are large on the sandwiches and slightly smaller on the noodle bowls. Their iced tea is also really good not surprisingly. The food here has been consistently good and it is definitely my spot to hit up when I am in the valley. I really would like to try the 'wings' as well as other sandwiches, I guess I need to visit AZ more.",

Green has such a wide variety of dishes and flavors that people are sure to find something they like. Their gluten-free menu is pretty good, but I wish it were more extensive (that's where the 5th star went). I definitely recommend the almond milk milkshakes - they are amazing and sometimes I drive all the way across town just for that. The pad thai and chili are also favorites.",

I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom \"Chicken\" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan \"meats\" and \"cheeses\" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!",

I got Henry's special (goat cheese, onions, butternut squash) on flatbread pizza...holy crap that was yummy! The husband  got a beet and ginger soup topped with goat cheese. I have no idea what they are putting in that goat cheese but that is what we were raving about 90% of the time we were there. He also got a Caesar salad - it was a nice surprise that they added some raw broccoli in there as well (that way you feel like you are getting -some- nutrition out of it).",

    "text": "It says a lot when a meat eater like myself will visit this vegan restaurant again and again. I have never had a bad meal here. Everything has been great from the original G spicy po' boy to the no harm chicken parm or the big wac that is a vegan take on the McDonald's Big Mac. They have salads, sandwiches, burgers, pitas, and all types of food from American to Asian, to Italian and more. They cary the best micro brewed sodas i have ever had. The prices are very reasonable and the employees are always very nice and give great customer service. Today I had Wendy's Pickle which is a breaded mock chicken cutlet with southern style spicy mayo and dill pickles.  The bread is so soft and delicious you would never guess it was made without milk or eggs. The cutlet looks and tastes so much like chicken that you don't miss the chicken at all. Add in the spicy and creamy mayo, and pickles and you have a fantastic lunch that would make anyone jealous wether they are vegan, vegetarian or a carnivore. The dish is served with thyme fries, tahini coleslaw or fresh fruit. I got the fries this time but I have tried the other sides and they are also great. The fries are long shoe string fries that are perfectly fried and have the best potato flavor with a crispy yet soft texture that makes you want to slam them in your face to keep the happiness going as long as possible. My total bill was $9.25 after tax. My vegetarian wife turned me (her meat loving husband) onto this place and I have come here more times without her than I have with her. That is how good this place is. It is an unpretentious restaurant with quality food. You will love it!",

We've had the mock buffalo chicken wings, the eggless rolls, crab puffs, jerk tofu salad, balsamic picnic salad, mexicali burger, secret bbq chicken sandwich, thyme fries, and sweet potato puffs.  Everything has been wonderful, but our faves are the chicken wings, eggless rolls, balsamic picnic salad, thyme fries, sweet potato puffs, and crab puffs.  Haven't tried the bowls yet but I'm assuming that they're just as good.   I crave this place all the time.  My husband thinks everything has been awesome, much to his surprise... mock chicken sounded a bit mysterious to him. So try it out both meat-eaters and non meat-eaters!  It's worth the trip!",

The atmosphere was fun and lively. The only things that I was not thrilled about is the seating. Basically you have to run to an empty table, bus it yourself, and if the table isn't empty you have to intrude on people that are getting ready to leave. I don't mind asking people if they are done with their meal but I felt a little awkward doing it, like I was rushing them..... The other negative is the way that the staff screams your name when your food is up. I think if they implemented a number system the whole place would function more efficiently. Overall, the experience was pleasant, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be going back.",

Same with all the other sides.   If you are a vegetarian for health reasons, don't even think about this place. The only items that are remotely healthy are 2 of the salads, both of which don't have mock meats (which are all deep fried BTW). But, why go out for that when you can make it at home?   The burgers are mushy. The \"no harm chicken parm\" was seriously barely any mock meat-mostly fried breading with oily vegan cheese. Again, good if you don't care about health but..... seriously? Blech. I'm a steak fry kinda girl, so their fries blow IMO.  The tahini coleslaw, however, is fantastic. I could eat buckets of it but it's a \"side\", so for $3, you get a measly serving of cabbage. Lame.   Dessert sizes (which exception of tsoynamis) are pathetic. $3 for that tiny peanut butter bar? Again, lame LOL.   Since it's really the only 100% vegan in the east valley it is passable, but it is *NOTHING* compared to places in SoCal or New York or Portland.",

However, some people that work their don't really understand gluten free and were not really sure about options even though there is a \"gf\" marking on their menu. If you are very sensitive to gluten I would not recommend. They are more focused on no meat than no gluten. That is for sure. I got the mock chicken Thai peanut salad. It is listed on the menu as a wrap but just get it as a salad. It is seriously so good and now I crave it!! I was a little worried about the mock chicken not being gluten free and the girl who worked there said she thinks it's gluten free. It did not both my stomach at all so I'm going to say she was correct. I am also not as sensitive as others. I will be back again and again.",

    "text": "SIMPLY, THE BEST! That is right. Hopefully, the song is running in your head as you read this review. My veggie friends all raved about Green when I moved here many moons ago. I am not one to buy into hype, but I definitely wanted to give it a try. I have now been there over 2 million times! Well, actually, more like a few dozen, but still, as many as I have been able to squeeze in. I take my veggie friends from far and wide, and they also fall in love with this place. I even brought my meat eating boss back a bar-b-que sandwich from here once, and he loved it! If you knew him - one of those guys that thinks anything labeled vegetarian is tasteless and disgusting - you would know what a big deal that is.  The food here is always wonderful. They have a great variety, and their unique inventions are always good too. I am a fan of bar-b-que, and their bar-b-que sandwich is delicious! It is as good as any bar-b-que I remember eating as a child when society forced me to eat the flesh of Earth's beautiful creatures. OK, I am being a bit dramatic. I would eat animal flesh bar-b-que with the zeal of a wild beast back then, and love it. But now I know better, and Green provides me the exquisite flavor of bar-b-que I loved as a beastly, carnivorous child without the need to murder innocents!  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I greatly enjoy their food.  I should mention, I do not mind the dining experience, but I suppose, from reading the other reviews, some may. You do have to stand in line to order your food, and at times, they can get very busy. So it might take some time to get your food. However, it has never taken a ridiculous amount of time, and most often it takes only a few minutes.  Luckily, I have had the pleasure of dining here with some great friends, and we always have no problem entertaining each other. Vegetarians are very intelligent, and some of the most interesting people I have met. My girlfriend is a carnivore, and she often has a hard time keeping up. I think grease congeals in their minds and slows everything down. JK! She is brilliant and beautiful, and she loves the food too.  Sorry if my review has been a bit silly and off point at times, but just thinking about Green makes me giddy. If you have not done so, I hope you visit them and enjoy the place as much as I do.",

I don't come here too often since I am not a vegetarian. But when I do I am always amazed by how much flavor is in their food and how I don't miss the meat at all. The only thing keeping them from four or five stars is the fact that they don't publish the nutrition information for their menu. I suspect that the reason their food tastes so good is because it probably has more sugar and salt in the sauces than I would want. Just because it is vegetarian doesn't mean it is low on calories. But I know that is not a concern for everyone...",

Since we were a little tired after hiking we decided to find a dedicated vegan place and spend sometime at that restaurant.  I selected it as it was rated high and not too far from the airport. The ambience was very nice and the place was very busy when we arrived at around 12.45 pm last Wednesday.  We were a group of 10 and we ordered a bunch of items from the menu. 8 of the 10 in the group were not vegans.  Overall, the food was great. It is organic to the extent possible and kudos to the owner for pricing it very reasonably.  I even purchased 3 different types of vegan cookie dough and loved that as well.  A must place if you are in the area.  Had a nice chat with the owner and appreciate his service.    I would be going again when in the area next time.",

Cookie was warm and gooey, and the soft serve was delicious. To make everything 100x better, it is all 100% plant based. What more can you ask for?

It's a perfect place to come and chat with someone. On one side of the restaurant are car doors. There are plenty of tables and booths.   You order & pay for your food at the cashier, you get a number on a stand and the waiters come and deliver it to your table.  I tried the cookie dough ice cream, which was pretty good. I noticed they had some korean items, which I'm interested in trying next time.",

The first time I came, as a tourist to Phoenix 8 years ago, I came with a carnivorous friend who turned up his nose at vegan food. He was outnumbered when it came to choosing the restaurant, and begrudgingly ordered a faux pulled pork sandwich. He asked to go back the very next day.   I've lived in this city for 7 years now, and when friends come to visit this is one of the restaurants I always recommend. I have tried around half of the menu, but since I've discovered the Wendy's pickle I am hooked (fried faux chicken with pickles, buffalo sauce, and vegan mayo on a ciabatta roll...) My husband always gets the Big Wac (vegan Big Mac, obv). If it were up to him we wouldn't bother eating at other restaurants at all. I have to put my foot down for the sake of variety... still, if I had to choose only one restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life... maybe...",

They have a large selection of \"mock\" meats w/ dishes vegetarians normally don't get to have. I had the Singapore orange rice bowl. It was a blend of broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and mock veggie chicken (you can choose from tofu, beef, or chicken). Flavor was good, my only complaint however was the absurd amount of sauce. The veggie:rice:sauce ratio was too much for me. I know for next time, I'll be asking for my rice on the side. My girlfriend had the spicy po-boy. I honestly had no idea what a po-boy was prior to this experience. I managed to get a few bites - it was pretty darn good - but also, too sauced out for our liking. We couldn't taste the rest of the goodness in the sandwich - just buffalo sauce.   There's enough stuff on the menu for me to come back and see what i like and don't like. the price is also right - they give ample portions for more than fair prices. They also make gluten free very accessible. Makes it easier to put on my list of restaurants that I'm allowed to frequent.   Looking around, they also serve alcoholic beverages. Can't complain about that either. There was a large amount of sitting space. It didn't look as big as it did from the outside. Nice patio as well!

All food there is vegan and they serve up amazing comfort food that resembles foods I ate growing up as a full on carnivore, but now I can enjoy them as a vegan too.  The wings are amazing and I usually get them every time as a side dish.  They have awesome sandwiches, rice or noodle bowls, salads.  They are the only place I know that serves up crab puffs that taste like I remember, only meat and dairy free!  The Tsoynamis (basically a vegan version of the Dairy Queen blizzard) are absolutely amazing.  This restaurant is amazing for vegans, gluten-free vegans, vegetarians, omnivores... everyone!  Thank you GREEN for being there and working hard everyday to create amazing food!",

I deeply appreciate how thoughtful the food is and that I can bring non-veg friends here and everyone leaves smiling.   However, I am not very disappointed in the shifting menu. Before, the vegan meat was INCLUDED in the salad -- now I have to pay upwards of 30% more to add it. Moreover, the salads are noticeably smaller with less fresh greens. I've also noticed a stark difference in quality in the Tempe location (much worse quality of ingredients and much smaller portions) compared to the downtown location. As a loyal customer and promoter, the menu changes are disappointing and wallet-breaking. I really hope management reads and listens to these reviews.",

I'm not vegan nor vegetarian and everything I've ordered has been delicious.   The restaurant is constantly working to improve itself and each time I go my experience is better than the prior. The Tempe/ South Scottsdale location recently updated their menus (one week ago), while keeping some favorites from the old menus, and I was a little apprehensive. I was recommended the Karma Curry. The dish is fantastic, as expected. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other newly added dishes. If you're looking for something light yet fulfilling give Green a shot, you'll love it.",

The place is super easy to find, the parking lot is pretty large so that is never an issue which is nice. There is seating outside of the restaurant and inside so when it does get busy there are both options, although since it is starting to get hot I wouldn't particularly want to sit outside now. Everything i've tried on the menu is delicious, i've never had a bad meal here. The animal fries are a definitely must try menu item and the Thai peanut is so good. The employees are always so nice and make sure everything is right when you order. The prices are definitely fair, especially since other vegan restaurants are a lot higher with pricing their items. Their homemade teas you can get as a drink option are all delicious and refreshing! I definitely recommend coming here if you're vegan, or not the food is that great!",

Their mock chicken wings are to die for, the mock crab puffs are seriously amazing, and their animal and thyme fries are delicious!  I will continue to cook at home, but it's nice to know if I ever need a vegan option for food it's available!   My only complaint is the f-ing line you have to wait in when you show up. Due to it being in Tempe and basically the only vegan place around that wait time was insane. I went in at 630 on a Friday and the line was out the door (literally) and I had phoned my order in at 6. It was done already, and I sat in that line for almost 20 minutes.   Also, the staff looked like they hated their jobs - not a single smile on any of their faces.   The food was worth it though! The quality of food was all in all pretty good.   Just make sure if you choose to go here to plan accordingly, this isn't somewhere you can show up for a \"quick bite\" to eat. There is a wait time, and the staff could give a sh!t less how long you wait.  I personally can get over that stuff for some good food (that I didn't have to cook myself), but I know others can't.",

It would have been 4 had it not been closed one morning.   As a meat-eater with a soy allergy, there are many reasons not to eat here, but I gave all of that up to enjoy as many entrees as possible.   Where do I begin...we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones, and the ranch dressing was perfect, the CRAB PUFFS which were mind-blowing, the bbq sandwich, the curry pasta, the argentine sandwich (delicious bread and chimichurri sauce), the fish tacos (which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees), and the kung pao chicken. And oh yes, two cupcakes and the betterfinger soy ice cream.   I am so depressed there isn't one in Austin, but I would say Green is reason enough to go back to AZ.",

    "text": "When you call, place a $40 to-go order with a ten minute wait & the person on the phone repeats your to-go order, one expects to get the right sides with the sandwiches. This was correct for 1/3 of the sides. If you were out of a side, you had my phone number to offer us something else or ask us when we arrived. Don't get me wrong, your fries are great, but 2 of us were really craving some of your cole slaw. Bad on us for not checking when we picked up, but I sent my husband to grab the goods. The big wac wasn't as great as it usually is. There was a definite lack of sauce, which I believe makes this mock burger so great! Haven't placed a to-go order in a while, because during busy times you can see your to-go order sitting on the counter, ready, while you have to wait in line to pick up & pay for it while others are in line deciding what to order. If I had the time to dine in, I wouldn't mind, but I am picking up a to-go order due to my lack of time. We love your restaurant, but the customer service isn't what it used to be either. We have been coming here since becoming vegan in 2013. Wanted to keep giving Green a chance, because we love your restaurant, but don't feel like our business with you is important anymore. I wish Green the best in expansion & hope that your growth doesn't also come with lacking in the customer service department.",

However, a friend convinced me and I decided to try it again.   Well, I am glad I did! The crab puffs were AMAAAAAAAAZINNGGG. I love crab puffs and was so happy to have a vegan version that didn't taste gross. I couldn't even tell it was vegan cream cheese (I'm sure we all know it's usually hit-or-miss) or fake crab! Also, I had the orecciette pasta with the no harm chicken parm, and loved it. The only problem with that was that even though they used Daiya vegan cheese, which I love, is that they just lumped it on the top and it was impossible to spread around, so that kind of ruined the parm part.   Also, their vegan chocolate chip cookies are incredible and I couldn't believe they were vegan so I even asked again just to make sure! (Yes, they're vegan).   I will definitely be coming here again. I'm dying to try the artichoke dip and their tSoynami's!",

Really they're only getting 3 stars because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and vegan options are limited as it is, so I always root for vegan restaurants to do well.  The flavor was pretty much there but the execution of dishes was lacking, sorry to say.  My friend and I ordered the fried won tons which were way too dark.  We also ordered dip (spinach/artichoke?) which was way too runny.  I ordered the golden arches style burger (forgot what it was called) and it had way too much special sauce on it which dripped out of the burger and made the texture too soft throughout (trying not to say mushy here).  We went Saturday night 1/28 and while it was busy and obviously popular, the food seemed like it was made by their second string cooks and we could only assume that their top staff had the night off maybe?? It's a bummer because we were only in town for that weekend anyway, but I really wanted to love it since their menu sounded so old fashion diner style good.",

    "text": "I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent \"manhood\" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.  There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...\"Asshole\".  He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...\"vote with your feet\"...but I guess that's another review.  The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!  At the very tippy top of the \"near and dear\" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.  Whit is a Vegan...with a capital \"Vege\"...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.  So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!  I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!  I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!  We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!  Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!  The big question about Green is \"why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?\"  I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.  I like to \"fit in\".  The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.  I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).  I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!  I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!",

There are so many delicious treats on their menu I'm not even going to bother naming off the things I've tried here. Just go, eat everything, and when you gain ten pounds don't come crying to me.  'But Kristi, aren't vegan dishes supposed to be healthy?' ummmm NO!  If I wanted healthy, I'd poach a chicken breast and eat it with some dry salad and brown rice. Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license.   Located in a strip mall, this place is full of Bieber-esque lesbians and 10 day neck beards just as you would imagine. I don't fit in but when exactly has that ever bothered me? There is even what appears to be a (very tiny) vegan market of sorts inside if you find yourself in desperate need of some Dayia or faux marshmallow fluff. You know, True diet staples. The register area is full of mouth watering vegan desserts that will make you say 'I didn't know you could do THAT with raw cashews!' Man, I love this place...  I haven't heard any news lately about the supposed 'new location' but I really hope that is still in the works as it is much closer to home. I can see myself picking up 3 orders of wings to eat in the privacy of my own abode while watching some god awful Lifetime movies on a Sunday. Bring it on Green.  nom nom nom",

They also cater to the vegan sweet tooth with baked goods and tons of different Blizzard-style Tsoynamis.    They post their menu online (of course) and it's definitely worth checking out before heading there because there are so many delicious options to consider!

Artichoke Dip was watery and looked like light grey/brown colored gunk.  I got the Thai Peanut Noodle Bowl with tofu and was only able to take a couple bites because it really tasted awful. I typically really like eating tofu too. Please believe me in that I am not a picky eater and it is very rare for me to dislike a restaurant meal.  My boyfriend got a mock beef dish that had this underlying soy flavor. One plus about both our entrees was the amount of veggies in our dishes, but we couldn't even pick out the vegetables because of that strong background taste that lingered on our tongues.",

    "text": "I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.  So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.  Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured....   and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!  So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.  An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...  BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.  So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.  I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest.",

My only complaints are that the prices are a bit high ($8-$9 entrees) for what you get, and the service is a little bit lacking. I'd typically expect lower prices for what is essentially a fast food restaurant, but the food is pretty good.",

I was highly skeptical of this advice because of course I've tried veggie burgers before and they never imitate the real thing very well. Well I was ASTONISHED! Green has perfected the art of fake meat - the burger was delicious and I could not believe that I was enjoying a veggie burger! It was even pink inside. Perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend it!",

Its a little hard to find if you've never been there before, its in a little strip mall nudged right into the corner by a print shop and a skate shop if I remember right. The decor is actually pretty cool and trippy. One wall is all yellow with a gigantic paragraph/quote of text on black that takes up that whole section and there are some cool paintings decorating it. It has this kitschy meets hippie vibe. Countr people were nice. I had mock chicken with noodles and you get served in the slanted ceramic bowls they have at mongolian BBQs like Genghis Grill. I had the mock chicken and noodles and if I didnt know better, Id swear it was pretty close to the real thing, the portions were pretty huge I didnt finish mine, but it was pretty cool to check out at least once, though I had kind of wished Id ordered the vegan chili fries when all was said and done.",

    "text": "I live in Tucson. Sorry to say it, but the one vegan restaurant here in town (Lovin' Spoonfuls), as hard as they try, doesn't hit the mark like Green does. I've been patiently waiting to incorporate a visit to Green into my usually busy and brief stays in Phoenix. Today was the day and I was not let down. Started off with the buffalo wings and artichoke gratin. The wings and ranch dip were fantastic. The wing sauce itself was a True standout and the ranch was as about as authentic as a vegan version could be. The artichoke dip was ok but not stellar. It was a bit soupy and probably would make a better sauce than anything else. For the main, I had to go with the Big WAC. It was at this point that I found myself in vegan nirvana. My high hopes for this plant based version of the American fav were exceeded. It tasted somewhere between the Big Mac and In n Out Double Double that I enjoyed so much in my omni days. A carnivore could easily be deceived by the tastes and textures of this burger. Towards my last couple of bites I felt a strange sadness knowing that I would have to drive 100 miles to have this treat again. The fries were good but there was no trace of thyme on them which for a thyme lover, is kind of a let down. All in all, I suspected that I was going to love Green. And my suspicion was correct. I can see myself frequenting Phoenix much more often because of this gem of an eatery. And contrary to previous reviews, I did not witness a cooler than thou, hipster attitude from the staff. The girl at the counter was very friendly and patient and several employees came by the table to check up on us. Keeping my fingers crossed for a Tucson location down the road.",

Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything!  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door, 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries, Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard), cupcakes, coffee & more!!!

I've had almost everything on the menu at least once, and I'm just such a fan. I prefer the mock-meats to the tofu, but the tofu is really great as well. I haven't disliked anything I've had yet. Of course, don't go in there expecting it to taste like typical food. Green serves the absolute best vegan/vegetarian fare I've ever had. And by now, I've had a lot.

The chili is super flavorful (albeit really salty, but I don't mind that!) and the fries are super thin, which I love! The tacos are also pretty good. They are surprisingly filling for only being $2.95 each. As a vegetarian who still eats cheese and dairy, I'm not really accustomed to things like fake cheese and ranch, but I've been impressed so far!   They also have ice cream! I'd never actually had vegan ice cream before this but I love it. It's not as creamy as regular ice cream but the flavor is just as good. The soft serve has a mild coconut flavor to it and they have a wide variety of toppings you can mix in.   I'm thankful that I live so close to Green - I will definitely be back many more times to try other menu items.",

If you are a person who has trouble giving up those food though, definitely try this out! It just didn't work for me. The baked goods from Numi are delicious though.",

The skinny  After missing out on a movie premier and having some time for a date with my significant other who happens to be a pescaterian we decided to try green as she has been dying to try the big wac. We called in our order and decided to pick up order took less than 10 min in and out great :-). The burger was great I could see why it's a big hit and the French fries are awesome I ate the whole batch. What really made my day was the organic sweet lime drink omg it was not too sweet and not too bland but just perfect mix almost like what u would like ur lemonade to come out like. The price was a lil high for me $11.50 for the meal but I think it was worth it. I was beyond full. The bad  I asked the cashier if it was possible to try the tea with a sample cup she said yes and gave me a big cup and charged me for it even though I asked just to sample maybe I didn't say it loud enough, and she charged me for it without first confirming that the price went up it ended up being ok as I liked the drinks they had. So no big deal. Overall This place is a must for anyone looking to improve eating habits or wanna try something diff for a change I will be coming back soon.",

The BBQ chicken sandwich was pretty solid. I stole some of my friend's peanut tofu and noodles... they were pretty good too.  I split a Tsoynami - I think it was the smores one.

The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh.

    "text": "Kudos for offering tasty vegan delights and meat alternatives to satisfy that occasional craving. However, the food here is quite greasy and not necessarily healthy. I ordered the Argentinian Po Boy and it was drenched in oil. The beef seitan was literally dripping in fat, and the peppers and onions were stir fried in far more fat than necessary. I also ordered the spicy peanut chicken seitan salad. The greens could have come out of a bag, the chicken seitan was oily beyond imagination, and the dressings were 99% oil.  The single dollar sign price rating is misleading. This place is EXPENSIVE because the portions are very small. You would expect a Po Boy to come on a decently sized bun, however what I received looked smaller than a basic hot dog bun. It tasted great, but the portion size and high fat content made for disappointment.   While I am a vegan, I eat a very low fat and healthy vegan diet. Although tasty, the food here is prepared with an obvious disregard to basic dietary common sense. Don't come here thinking you are eating healthy - you are not. However, on those occasions when you want a greasy meal without the meat guilt, this is your place. I would not recommend eating here on a regular basis unless you are prepared to ingest a lot of vegetable oil with its negative consequences.  To the owner and chef - why don't you offer a healthy, low fat menu to those of us who don't want our vegan meal to contain more fat than a quarter pounder with cheese and fries? There isn't even an option for low fat salad dressings. I fear for those who come here thinking they are eating a healthy meal. Vegan /= healthy here.   Why three stars? Because I enjoy this place on those occasions when I want a greasy fix without having to eat meat or patronize an evil fast food chain restaurant.",

She had the Drunken Mushroom Noodle Bowl and yes WE SCORED! (she doesn't like food in US in general) so this was a great choice, not spicy, not just meat and carbs, and not overpriced.  My friend had the Singapore Tofu Noodle Bowl and was delighted. And I had the  Argentine Po-Boy, YUM!! it almost taste like tender beef! though I was not able to perceive the chimichurri ... To finish we had a vegan double (or was it triple) chocolate slice. Happy ladies after that!!!  Staff is really friendly and service is great despite the demand they have. I would join their carnivore caravan if I were around. For sure a lot of hard core carnivore could consider reducing their intake.   Downside? plastic cups, and other not very earth friendly material in their serving baskets. Maybe  next time !",

We got take-out bowls - one Italiany thing my husband got and the most delicious mushroom with noodles bowl - I find myself thinking of it when I get really hungry. Everything was tasty. Super tasty!

I can at last read \"chicken wings\" and actually order them, extra sauce. I can drool at the thought of a po' boy sandwhich, spinach and artichoke dip, or spicy singapore noodles. I can wear a baseball cap, order chili fries and kick it with the home team. I can introduce you to all my beloved carnivores and listen to the \"mmmmm\"s without any questions as to why I choose to eat the way I do. ** Sigh **",

    "text": "Being a vegetarian isn't always the easiest lifestyle to live.  People tease you, and give you odd looks when its brought up in conversation.  And god forbid a meal at mom and dad's goes by without someone making mention of your weird eating habits.   Its a good thing that Green came along to help strengthen our resolve. and more importantly, to help convince non-vegetarians that vegans and vegetarians aren't a bunch of weirdos who eat soy-paste and lentils all day.   With a wide array of options on their menu, Green has enough variety to please pretty much everyone, vegan or not.  After eating here at least twice a week for the last few months I've come close to sampling the entire menu, and there really isn't a bad thing that I can say about it.  The mock chicken and the phoney beef  used in Green's sammy's are alarmingly accurate in both flavor and texture.  The curry bowls are some of the best I've had, and the orecciette pasta with chicken  parmesan is worth killing for - which is saying a lot in vegan circles. Bottom line:  if you're in the neighborhood, you'd be a fool not to stop in and sample some of the items on the menu.  If you don't find something at green that you absolutely love, you may want to see a doctor, because there is a good chance that you are dead and haven't realized it yet. Finally, if the slew of rave reviews here on yelp hasn't convinced you yet, you can check out Green's menu right here:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenvegetarian.com%2Fmenu.jpg&s=fc98dd937f7cf72bb4f2d3601734c59fe0d09efedab98b8e8f04855da78b1e88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">greenvegetarian.com/menu...</a>",

BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.  my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.   their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.  green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.",

She had the Thai peanut bowl with noodles and tofu, I had the same but with mock chicken and my husband had the curry bowl with rice and mock chicken. They were all large portions and the flavors were great.  My husband's was a little dry so he asked for more sauce which they brought right out.  We all agreed we would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Vegan = Tasty.  No macro platters here, though if they did have one, i bet it'd be covered in some mouth-watering sauce.  This vegan restaurant is for people who like animal products as much it is for people who don't.  Almost everything on the menu comes with at least an option of mock meat of one kind or another.  And mock meat is tasty, though probably not necessarily healthy.  The original \"g\" spicy po-boy reminded me almost exactly of Switch's Buffalo Bleu Chicken sandwich (my favorite).  It was hardly noticeable that Green's version had no bleu cheese, mock chicken patties and veganaise.  The texas \"moo-shroom\" po-boy was excellent as well with a sweet BBQ sauce and heaps of mushrooms, red peppers and onions.  I do not like the tahini coleslaw - too much peanut sauce.  We were so impressed with our lunch that we ordered a couple of cookies for dessert and that was when we remembered the reason we could never be entirely vegan....no butter in the cookies!  At least they use real chocolate instead of carob.  I also enjoy all of the green building products on the walls, but not the styrofoam cups, so much.",

Maybe it's the community seating, or the simple white bowls your veggies come in, or maybe it's the simple fact that you're eating your veggies and enjoying them too. I tried a yummy coconut curry with crispy tofu and appreciated that it was just the right portion for the price.

That is where this joint stands out.   The mock chicken dishes were just great with the right amount of spice and flavor . The decor is decidedly hippiesh but not overbearing . We went on a Thursday evening and it was CROWDED! there was a virtual nonstop line but totally worth the wait. Ask them to make the entrees a little spicy and then enjoy them with their homemade lemonade.  Dont forget to try the incredible vegan chocolate cake! Their specialty ice-cream is great too.",

I loved the BBQ chicken though it tasted almost like regular chicken and it was really tasty.  The fries were really tasty too.

I don't know much about the vegetarian/vegan lifestyle, but I do know that every vegan item I have ever put in my mouth has been immediately spit out. I told the girl taking our orders that I am not a vegan, thinking I may be shunned from the establishment, but instead she told me she wasn't either and then she assured me that their faux meat actually tastes like sweet, juicy, animal meat (my words, not hers). Praise Jesus! And she was so right! I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and it actually tasted like chicken! However, it didn't feel any healthier to eat. Loaded with BBQ sauce and mayo, I still felt like a fatty. My husband, also the polar opposite of anything vegetarian, ordered the Diablo Red and fell in love. This place is nearing a 4 star review, but the menu looks so scary to me that I don't know if I can give it a 4 yet. Lots of spicy items and I don't like spice. Really good food, service, and atmosphere. As the Terminator once stated, \"I'll be bock.\"",

With stellar sandwiches like the G-spicy po'boy and the Secret BBQ chi'kn sandwich, Green disproves the notion that vegan food is rabbit-food.   Don't be shy here, the staff is generally very friendly and happy to suggest their favorites.  I've found that the staff is happy to oblige simple requests like more sauce and more heat.    Yes, I've personally had every sandwich, salad, and appetizer on the menu - my favorite is the Ranchero Salad (easy on the flour tortilla strips).  ...and I'm working my way through the bowls.    Don't miss trying the Thyme Fries or a Tsoynami.  They're great to share, especially since you also split the guilt of these treats.",
