    "text": "I feel bad about this, but why, I'm the one who spent Friday night throwing up!    I walked in to pick up my to-go order of Red Curry Chicken with brown rice only to find a woman ordering the very same thing.  She enthusiastically praised the red curry and said that I would love it.  After that and the mostly good reviews on Yelp, I thought I was in for a treat.    The funny thing is, it was really good.  I thought that I found a great little gem.  The curry had tons of veggies and they even had brown rice, I was pleased as punch.  Skip forward to the next morning and I was feeling nauseous, by the afternoon I was in flat out pain and well, I won't tell you the rest.  I can only equate it to that meal, all I had before it was fruit and a piece of toast for breakfast and a Lean Cuisine for lunch.  I started feeling slightly ill that night after my dinner from La's and it progressed steadily from there.  I feel bad because the meal was good and obviously the lady who so enthusiastically recommended the curry hadn't experienced this before.  I wish I could call her and ask her if she got sick too.  Maybe this was a fluke, but I'm sure as hell scared to try it again!     So, if you wanna know if the curry was good- yes it was.  I would have given it 4, maybe even 5 stars, unfortunately ruining my weekend brings it down to 1 star.  I feel compelled to say that the place seemed clean and the employee who helped me was nice, I am sad that I won't be going back.  Just don't say I didn't warn you.  Maybe just stay away from the curry?",

    "text": "Found this restaurant craving mainly Thai iced tea. Luckily they just started being open on Sunday's for lunch! Had Thai iced tea which was perfect, as well as the green curry with beef and the Orange chicken. The green curry was very tasty, a little more on the spicy side (I asked for mild) but still felt like it was quite hot. So I take it as if they're more authentic with their spice. Orange chicken was nice and crunchy and flavorful. The service was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back to this place and recommend to others.",

This is seriously one of the better Thai places in town and it's worth the drive from N Scottsdale.    The last time I had Thom Kha Gai soup this good was in Thai town near Hollywood.  The coconut broth was a serious harmony of flavors:  sweet, creamy, sour, tangy..  OMG, it was sooooo good!  I asked for it spicy & I loved they way they added sliced thai red peppers to the soup instead of chile powder as they would at other places.  I did the 'tilting' of the bowl to get the last spoonful.  Yes, it was THAT good!  I had a hard time choosing my entree, but ended up with the Spicy Wide Noodles with Shrimp..  The one thing I noticed is that everything tastes good because the flavors are blended together so well, like they put care into cooking a delicious spicy dish, rather than  just a flavorless spicy dish.  Anyways, the noodles were perfectly cooked and the shrimp seemed fresh and abundant.    Anyways, I'm hooked & can't wait to go back.  It was empty when I was there last time so I hope my 2cents will help to get the word out!",

No, but both are located in little strip mallish areas and are great for a pop in lunch/dinner or especially takeout.    I got my old stand by:  Tom Kai Gai soup and it was delicious.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and they kept them outta there!    Chicken Panang.. outstanding.  I asked for 'medium' heat and it was just that.

I regretfully sent it back because I only had a couple bites (literally two bites no exaggeration). My boyfriend had the chow mein and he enjoyed it.   Our server was very sweet and attentive. However when we got our bill they charged me half price for a full bowl of curry that was barely eaten. I had to talk to the owner because (even though I hate sending food back and causing issues) I thought it was a bit unfair to charge me at all. They eventually honored that and we left a good tip for our server.   Needless to say, I won't be coming back to feed my green curry addiction.",

What more can you ask for?  We were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai.   We end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild.   How it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level.   Oh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)  Overall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.  Thanks La's Thai Cuisine for giving me such a good first experience!",

My husband and I used to come here and do take out at least once a week when I was too tired to cook dinner, aka make a giant mess.  We would have never thought of to come here on our own if it wasn't for yelp. It's a very small restaurant, in a small strip mall. The kitchen consist of two Thai ladies and the counter is worked by one of the lady's daughter.  Just order these dishes and you'll be good. They do have more daring dishes but I'm pretty vanilla.

We're overjoyed that we did. From the moment we entered, I could tell that we were in for a treat. The staff was amiable and our waitress provided amazing service with a smile. The atmosphere is casual and the cuisine is top-notch. I ordered an appetizer off the \"special board\" (though it was hard to choose just one, everything looked delicious) and started off with the Tod Mahn (fish cakes with a side of pickled cucumber and sweet & sour sauce) and a round of Thai Iced Teas. For our entrees, I chose the Chicken Red Curry and she picked the Mixed Vegetables with Chicken. Thai food, in general, is so well balanced. This was a step above. Perfectly sour, sweet, creamy, salty with a touch of heat..the portions were large but I didn't leave anything on my plate. It's THAT good. Great service, wonderful food, comfortable atmosphere.  I've found my new favorite spot for Thai food in the valley. I'll be back.",

It came in a bowl loaded with seafood and veggies (I don't understand when restaurants serve curry on a plate...). It also came with a small salad (lettuce with a tomato slice... a little lame but a nice thought) and big bowl of rice for us to share.  Overall, awesome experience. The ambiance is casual and the service is friendly. We'd go back... but we'd also try other places in the area.   They lose one star because the seafood didn't seem fresh. But then again, we're in Arizona.... Also, that little salad...  A solid 4-star experience and a great choice if you're looking for some yummy Thai food in the area.",

The portions are huge- one meal usually feeds me for 3 meals- so it is a great deal. I never stay to eat there because it's super small inside.... like I said \"local dive\" feel. It's not fancy but has a lot of character. Everyone who works there is SUPER friendly!! I would say it's some of the best Peanut Thai I have had.

    "text": "My experience was... interesting. Let me start by saying (for the people who wont read everything below) that the food is good, is it amazing/best I ever had? No, but its solid Thai food. & I would probably come back again (partly because there isn't great thai food in Scottsdale IMO).   Food ordered: Pad thai -- no shrimp, only chicken (medium spicy), Mixed Vegetables w/ chicken (medium spicy), order of chicken fried rice (medium spicy), order of egg rolls (comes with 4 -- & they're actually spring rolls, no meat) = $42  Anyways, so I call on Sun night 6PM at Sky Harbor parking lot for carry out & they say 15 min -- we get there 10 min later & wait inside. Inside there are two couples & one group of 4 sitting & also a couple in front of us at the counter waiting for carry out. While we are waiting one of the women sitting at the table was just furious that that the lady who was doing the take out -- bagging the orders & cashier was also taking care of all of the tables (they must be under staffed) so she was yelling out loud \"PUT THEM ON HOLD\" to the employee every time someone called for take out... it was just so awkward. Then when this lady finally got her food she was like \"OH MY GOSH ITS RAW, THE VEGGIES ARE RAW\" and mind you, this is a tiny place, you can pretty much hear everyone's conversations if you wanted to. So this is so awkward, my boyfriend & I were like errrrrrrrr get us out of here ASAP. So this lady was out loud complaining, the female lady who apparently worked the whole restaurant was running around like crazy, it was just a busy place. So our food took more like 25-30 minutes rather than the 15 min we were told.  But at the end of the day, the food was good. We had enough to get a few meals out of it. But the experience was interesting, I don't think I would ever eat in because I can just tell service is slow, unless you come not during the dinner rush. And for carry out, allow more than enough time. Also, it was a little pricey.. 4 tiny spring rolls were like $8? Should have been like $5 max,",

Really great Pad Thai, they put it on a bed of cabbage which I stirred all up in and it was fresh and crunch and flavorful. Salad rolls fresh and excellent. The soup was really \"milky\" with coconut/cream. Different than I have had for Tom Ka, but it was okay. Just not the norm, no big pieces of cool roots, mainly some chicken and mushrooms in milky coconut broth, no steaming fire bowl (sigh).  Staff really helpful and friendly, older lady in the kitchen checked in on us. Lunch specials a good way to try everything.",

Im not sure we would have come here because of where its located and getting into the parking lot is not the easiest. You either need to enter from the back of the plaza or u-turn at the light and turn into the gas station next to it.  We were greeted and sat as soon as we arrived, handed our menus and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Only 2 other tables were occupied at the time so service was very good. She promptly came back and took our order. We ordered the Egg Rolls, Coconut Soup, Green Curry and the Pad Thai. Everything was great and very tasty.  The only thing I thought was that the Pad Thai was a bit too sweet and over cooked.The reason for the 4 stars. My boyfriend loved everything.  We are both looking forward to coming back so we can try more of the menu.",

I would try having some food here, maybe to meet a friend if we are on our way somewhere else for the day. =)   I always see a steady flow of people at this location and the food has always been very fresh and made-to-order.  I've had a few of their stir-fry dishes and have enjoyed them all.  They are not the best Ive ever had, but they are tasty and fresh! The portion sizes to go have always been generous and I can often share an entree with my hubby.  I haven't tried the curries, but I plan to soon.    If you are in the area and want some Thai food, I would give them a try.  There are some places north of here that are WAY more expensive and lack some of the authentic flavor you get from smaller mom and pop type Thai places.    Before I forget, I like food hot, however they can adjust or omit heat, simply ask. =)",

Granted, I have been eating spicy food ever since I was younger so my palette is pretty desensitized lol. The only thing I wasn't crazy about the pad Thai was that it was too heavy on the fish sauce, the smell of it was overwhelming. I will ask for less fish sauce next time, and also want to try their green papaya salad and spicy basil. Service was excellent too. All in all, it was a great experience.",

That's when I googled for Thai food and found La Thai. After the first visit, I knew that I am going to be a regular. The first time, the food was tasty but not spicy and I had to spice it up a bit to match my taste. The cook/waiter remembered that and when I went there next time, they made sure that my food is extremely spicy... that's when I realized that my search is finally over.

I also got an order of their cream cheese wontons - I think it was around 8 to an order. I got take-out so I didn't sit down but from what I could see, it looked like a really nice/clean place with a good ambiance.  The red curry with pork was AMAZING. So good. So yummy. Exactly what I expect and want from a red curry. Their vegetables were cooked the way I like them in curry - borderline mushy. The pork was flavorful and tender. 5 stars for this dish.  But - both the egg roll that came with the lunch special along with the cream cheese wontons were awful. Just like... Plain awful, nothing about them was remotely good. The cream cheese wontons were the biggest let down. They were supposed to have cream cheese and chives in them, I believe? I couldn't taste any of that though... Just a TON of wrapper and barely any filling. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for 8 of those, but alas, unfortunately I paid around $7 or $8.The egg roll was similarly disappointing and also their dipping sauce wasn't good either.  So long story short - the entree was phenomenal, the appetizers were terrible. Proceed with caution!",

    "text": "Pros: Quick Service Pretty good portion size! Affordable I have only gotten takeout from here, but I always get the Red Curry Shrimp.   Cons: The spicy scale is inconsistent.. I was told it was out of 5 levels, so I ordered level 4- spicy but not death. Well nah too hot. So then I ordered a level 3 another time.. this was so weak.. as if there was no spicy taste at all. The next time, I ordered 4 again.. and confirmed it was out of 5 levels.. but then was told nope, only 4 levels.. so I mean, some days it is out of 5 levels, and sometimes out of 4 I guess, sometimes the taste of firey death, other times weak sauce. Another con- the appetizers are legit garbage.. I ordered the wontons.. $9, for burned pieces of pastry with cold, frozen shrimp in the middle.. Took one bite, threw them out. Ordered the fresh spring rolls, they were bland, and tasted just not fresh.. lastly, I have ordered the egg rolls- tasted like a mix of everything in the kitchen, cut up, and rolled and left in oil for too long.   I think the burned pastry taste is old oil.. reused, reheated, etc..   I think overall, if youre dying for a quick fix for some thai food, and on the way home, really hungry off work- yeah order a solid entree and youre golden.  I would not drive out of the way, or write home to mom about the meals tho.. I am moving in a few months, and when I visit Phoenix, not a place I would be dying to get a taste of.",

After 3-4 days of non-Asian food on Spring Break in Arizona....we were in need of some Thai food bad. We found La's less than 2 miles away from the Scottsdale Stadium area.   The service was good, plenty of parking and credit card ok. Pad Thai...good and decent (a bit on the sweet side), Pad See Ew was good and then basil mint ground chicken (graa-pow) was decent. We were able to quench our Thai food thirst.",

It was a very clean environment so much so that I could smell a veiled hint of bleach when I tried to sit at the table by the window (enter, left)  I moved to another table but I least I knew that they follow proper sanitation procedures.  I also noted that the male cooks had hair nets on--- a good thing since hair in food is not a good thing.   It was an attractive setting and the young lady who greeted us was super friendly.    We ordered the fried tofu as an appetizer which arrived with a delicious peanut sauce.  Tofu is pretty cheap so a $6.95 sticker price for tofu was a little high or am I the one being cheap?   We also ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken.  We ordered it Thai Hot which is the Super Bowl of hotness!   They let you pick a number to reflect the degree of spiciness.  Once you are in the Thai Hot zone, there's no going higher.  (I don't think!)  I ordered number 26 (or 27) which is ground chicken with green beans and veggies.  It was really good.  Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked.   Service was attentive and friendly.   This is the place where I am going to get my Thai fix from now on.",

Some of my favorites are  Pad Thai(rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, egg, green onion, sprouts and peanuts)  Chow Mein(egg noodles with meat and mixed vegetables) Yellow Curry(shrimp/chicken in a yellow curry paste mixed with coconut milk, onions, potatoes, carrots and pumpkin) Garlic and pepper Shrimp Fried Shrimp(batter fried served with a sweet and sour sauce some carrots and broccoli)  I think they also have a few lunch specials.This place is definitely worth a try if you have some Thai food craving on a chilly winter evening.

Everything else was above average compared to other Thai places in town.  Portions were generous and the quality of ingredients quite high.  The Spicy Basil would have benefited from more basil to compliment the perfectly cooked tender beef.  The BBQ chicken was disappointingly bland and the sauce it was served with was too sweet and not what's traditionally used.    I was expecting the food to be spicier after reading the previous reviews.  Next time I'll have to ask them for Thai spicy.",

I really like everything I've had, but my favorite is one that my husband got the last time: sweet curry with nuts. He likes nuts, but whatever.  It sounds lame, but it's incredible. Spicy and sweet is such a great combo and I ate more of his, than my own spicy noodles. My dish was good, his was great.   It's cheap for dinner; around $20 for both dishes, and is plenty of food for a second meal, later.   La's: it's what's for dinner.",

    "text": "This little hidden gem of a Thai restaurant on the southeast corner of Mcdowell & Hayden roads (next to the Subway) is simply fantastic Thai food (some of the best I've had in the States, and I've spent considerable time in Thailand), and the we go every two weeks or so. I've never had anything that has been anything other than fantastic.  To start with, the salads are excellent...Larb salad (odd name, I know) is good, the silver noodle salad (the clear noodles really add to the salad), and shrimp salad is our favorite, very simple, but excellent dressing and the shrimp are flavored/grilled to perfection. The pad thai, the most standard Thai dish, was excellent as expected, but the Rad Nar is my favorite noodle dish from La's. For curry, the red is what I see other people ordering the most when there, but my favorite curry is the sweet masaman, and La's makes a good masaman. The pineapple curry is good too, and if it's the available, the seasonal pumpkin curry is unique and delicious.  As to the other dishes, they're all good... but without a doubt, the highlight of the rest of the menu is the spicy salmon dish...spicy salmon, NOT breaded, with vegetables in a dark, spicy sauce is simply amazing...not enough words to describe this. The salmon is crispy, and holds the flavor of the dish. The vegetables fantastic.  To wash it down, the Thai tea is a great deal...$2...where other places it's $3 or $4.  Lastly, the service is good...just a standard little unpretentious Thai spot, with a couple of very sweet little Thai ladies working there... they're friendly and the food is out quick, whether for dine in or takeout.  Great spot!",

La's had received good reviews, so he decided to give it a try.  He ordered me the Green curry with Tofu and brown rice, and chicken Panang curry for him. My curry was very tasty, with just the right amount of heat. My only complaint is that I have so many bamboo shoots to poke around it was annoying.  Hottie seemed to be pleased with his curry as well.  I guess my dilemma here is that it was good, not the best I'd had, but certainly decent.  So, do I score them a 3 or a 4? Ugg, this is when I wish yelp let you give  1/2 stars!   Based on the sheer genius of some of their competitors' curries, I'm going to have to go with a 3.  But for what it is worth, in my mind it's a 3.5.",

The \"Gaeng Dang\" or \"Red Curry\" was a disappointment. It was low on flavor. And the chicken was dry. The rice was also too wet. Jasmine rice is supposed to be light but not stuck together. Anyway I'll come back and try the other items on the recipe but so far it is not great. At least from an authentic Thai standpoint.",

Totally flavorless mostly lettuce and the peanut sauce was straight up mixed with corn syrup it was so sweet.   I got vegetarian pad see ewe and I couldn't get over how it smelled like greesy rotisserie chicken somehow? The veggies in it did not taste fresh. I asked for a 3.5 out of 4 on the spicy scale and I got a zero. Not a single chili flake. Our waitress must not have understood what I said but she didn't skip a beat while taking our orders so I expected to get something spicy.   My husband got the yellow curry which was spicy as he ordered a 3. The broth was almost powdery and had pumpkin in it which is unusual for yellow curry. I am always disappointed when they serve normal cheap rice with curry instead of Jasmine rice so once again - another disappointment with our meal.   There were only 3 tables filled in the whole restaurant but our waitress seemed stressed and rushed and never refilled our waters, good thing we didn't get fountain drinks or it would have been a bigger deal to me.    We will not be back the food was so so bad, and it's not cheap!",

I ordered Shrimp Panang Curryand that is a red curry with the peanut sauce added in for a unique rich taste.   This just tastes like red curry with actual peanuts in it instead of sauce.  To put actual peanuts in the curry, I've never seen it like that before... None the last the spice levels were good, it was hearty and in the near future, I will go back  make O back and try something else in the near future and the service is better then the what I've are really received they will then get 5 stars",

    "text": "I recently offered to treat a co-worker to lunch and asked him for a suggestion. He highly recommended this restaurant and, since I had not already tried it, I was eager to do so.  I ordered two curry entrees with chicken, one red and one yellow, two full portions of rice, and two orders of Sticky Rice with Mango.  Pros: The portion sizes were generous, as was the quantity of chicken and vegetables, and probably more than enough for one person.  I had the yellow curry and the chicken and vegetables were tender but not mushy. The consistency of the broth was rich with good depth of flavor, very satisfying, and the seasoning was perfect for me.  I ordered Spicy Level 2 on a scale of 1 to 3. Were this curry to be served in Thailand then I expect the Spicy Level would be a negative number because I found it to be relatively mild. However, considering this restaurant is located in Scottsdale I think their scale is adjusted appropriately.  The Sticky Rice with Mango was among the best I've had in southern Arizona. This was due to the fact that the portions of rice and mango were larger than usual for local Thai Restaurants I've tried before and the rice was very good.  Cons: The only concern I had was the tab for lunch came to about $20 per person, which I thought was a little pricey.  At the same time, I did order plenty of food and considering that Thai food in southern Arizona is often somewhat disappointing I would say it was worth the treat.",

    "text": "Satori to Kaigen! (Enlightenment and Spiritual Awakening!)  1st review.  Nervous and working on an empty stomach, with the only exception being the half loaf of French bread and herb-butter I had consumed prior to dinner. Thinking Asian all day and being an incapable decision maker, I rely on Yelp and the assistance of a small list and a single 6 sided cube with dots on it.  I jotted down 6 prominent businesses, held my breath and flicked a wrist.  A \"2\" brought me to La's Thai Cuisine!  Peeped the website and open til 9:30, score! My eye spotted closing time was at 9:00 though!  Arriving on the scene at 8:49, poorly reverse parking my Honda in two spots because I was worried that they were closed.  They weren't, I was met by a Thai beauty introducing herself as Lisa.  I humbly asked for takeout, my adventure begins with the opening door...  Smells are incredible.  Having thought they were closed, I had forgotten what I was going to order! I rifled through the menu, feeling as if the whole kitchen was watching (they weren't) but she instructed me to take my time; So I ordered a soup, a salad, an entree, a dessert and a side of brown rice. They kindly ask me for my preference on the degree of heat, on each item, I asked for not the hottest but close to the top.  #17  Mixed Vegetable Soup: Stellar  Culinary Thought: Clear, piping, spicy and vegetable packed.   Ninja Eating Plan: Gently lay over white and brown rice, alternately.  # 9   Papaya Salad (Som-Tum): Phenomenal  Culinary Thought: I got shrimp on the side, due to allergies.  This was probably the most awesome experience of the evening.  They even \"fenced in\" the shrimp within a Masai-esqe cage of cabbage, to prevent their oceanic brine from invading the delicate papaya, sprout and carrot forest. Spice and crunch with every munch. Beautiful.  Ninja Eating Plan: Try not to be seen scarfing this down in front of a date, it's that awesome. Fortunately, my sister was only present and she knows I can eat like a pig and sound like one, too.  # 53 Peanut Curry (Panang curry style, comes with rice!): Umami  Culinary Thought: I don't like coconut. I do now. The lemon and coconut milk rises through the savory peanut curry.  Tofu was my protein option, it was done perfectly.  Green beans provided great consistency in this masterful crescendo.  Ninja Eating Plan: Laid over rice, alternately brown and white rice, interrupted by the occasional, gorgeous, curry-only spoonful.    Coconut Ice Cream: Yum  Culinary Thought: I was reeling at this point but I wanted to continue this experience.  As I stated earlier, coconut is not my thing but I believe in giving things a fair try, so I did.  Coconut ice cream is delicious. Coconut pulp, or meat, I still have a texture issue with, but the honey swirl throughout the ice cream made this delectable.  Ninja Eating Plan: Use the cooling ice cream energy to return your body back to normalcy. Perfect coda for the culinary symphony.  I will be back.  I plan to have every dish vegetarian style.  Family-run places are truly number 1.    Overall experience of the Culinary Ninja: PAVLOV  Do you hear the sound of a bell chiming?",

The spring rolls are excellent - very fresh and crispy. A little more flavor would be my only complaint if you twisted my arm to come up with something to complain about.  The summer rolls are good as well. I had some pad thai, but the peanut smell prevented me from enjoying it. It's probably good if you like that sort if thing. I couldn't tell you. I will try it again - it's really close. Next time, I'll have a look at a menu and actually pick something out.",

Just dropped the check and said sorry the owner says you have to pay becuase you didn't get anything else.  What?  I was afraid to order more after receiving what appeared to be turned shrimp?

    "text": "The short: Tasty Thai, very friendly service, and a clean, well-lit, comfortable, and quiet strip mall space.  The long: La's Thai is just south of the gas station on the southeast corner of Hayden and McDowell, and there's plenty of parking in front and behind the complex, with a handy backdoor if you're in the back. We were greeted by some very friendly young women and told to pick a table--plenty to choose from at 7 pm on a Saturday as there were just a couple of tables taken and a couple of people ordering takeout (more came in as the night went on). Decor is a little generic, but comfortable and interesting, with a few of the tables sporting some pretty woven cloths and some carved wood art on the walls.   We had the fresh rolls, satay, stuffed chicken wings, Pad Thai at medium heat, Panang curry at medium heat, and white sticky rice with mango (purple rice was an option, but our server said she favored white, so we went with that). The fresh rolls were going to be my step-daughter's entree, but she's allergic to cucumbers, and I was a bonehead and forgot to ask if the rolls used them--of course they did, and our server offered to take them away and bring something else for her. We decided to just have her eat the satay as her entree while the rest of us used the fresh rolls as our app. We ordered a Thai tea, iced tea, and young coconut drink (it came in a tall can that served two) to drink. All the beverages were tasty.  All the apps came together, including the spring rolls kiddo had ordered as her entree, which was fine because we switched her meal around, anyway. Everything was very good, although I was a little baffled by the big scoops of either cabbage, lettuce, or both that accompanied every dish except for the stuffed wings and Panang curry. I initially wondered if the stuff was a garnish, but there was way too much of it. It was fine with the satay, and we ate bites of cabbage with the chicken and the delicious peanut sauce it came with, although that sauce strangely started to congeal a little bit as the meal went on. That didn't affect its flavor, though. The satay chicken was wonderful--tender and moist, slightly sweet and aromatic with spices. The lettuce scoop didn't make sense with the fresh rolls, which were already stuffed with greens. The peanut sauce that came with the spring rolls was even better than the satay's, and yay, it stayed completely liquid! Neither of the peanut sauces were sweet (I swear some places use Jif peanut butter), and they had that nice umami flavor with a slightly sour edge that I love in Thai peanut sauce. The fresh rolls were, indeed, fresh--lettuce, pops of flavorful herbs, glass noodles, crunchy chopped cucumber, and fresh, chewy wrappers. We were divided on the stuffed wings. An interesting idea--a dense pork filling in boned, fried, full-size wings (not drummettes!). It was well cooked and the chicken skin had a nice crisp to it, but the filling, and thus the whole dish, was just underwhelming.  I liked the Pad Thai, although it was lighter on veggies than I'm used to; but it's exactly as described in the menu: \"Small rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts and peanuts.\" La's is a very noodle-centric dish, but the noodles were perfectly cooked--not gummy, clumpy, oily--a good chew without being undercooked, and loose so each noodle came up separately. The proteins were also perfectly cooked--not dry and over cooked like a lot of Pad Thais I've had. As for the heat--I couldn't find it, so it was more mild than medium. I think the Panang curry got all my chili.  The curry was thick, rich, and packed with peanut flavor, again without being too sweet, and overall tasty. The veggies were cooked well with just some crunch to them, and the chicken was again tender and moist. It came with a big side of rice--plenty to make at least two servings of food.   We all loved the sticky rice with mango. Such a beautifully simple dish--a generous serving of sweet rice coated with coconut cream and two big hunks of sweet, fresh yellow mango; this was one of the best versions we've had--every component just right.  Overall, while there are plenty of good Thai spots in the area, I wouldn't pass La's Thai if I were in the area.",

If you know ANYTHING about Thai culture or food, this is the real thing!  I can't recommend this place more highly than the five stars YELP allows!  Keep in mind that level 4 (Thai hot) is HOT!  I like it that way, but if you don't have an iron stomach, stick with 2 Medium!  They don't serve booze, but the Jasmin Tea is served in it's own pot, and is authentic and worth trying, even if  you don't like tea.  The wontons are unique and delicious.  The yellow curry is something you order extra portions just to take home with you.  Park in the back as there is plenty of room.    This place is on the top of my list.

    "text": "Having just moved to Scottsdale, I decided to try a couple of nearby places. My cousin (sweety) was in  the mood for Thai, and on this stormy night, it was close to where we live. A cute little place in a non-descript stripmall, The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the heat. As in temperature...nothing gets the meal off to a bad start when you can't dine in comfort. Even though I'm hot (lol), I ordered the Tom Yum soup. for 4.25 its a big bowl with 2 shrimp swimming in a zesty, SPICY broth. I ordered the soup Med-hot and that was plenty hot. YUM!  After sipping the soup, our server took requests for dinner, we started with another appetizer: Larb. The flavor was very good, just the right amount of mint and other secret spices....but the mountain of lettuce it is served on was perplexing. Every Thai restaurant I've been to serves Larb with Iettuce leaves, so one can make it a wrap, this was a nice twist on the presentation, but I prefer the more traditional style.    Here is one of my pet peeves at a restaurant....Why, for the love of God do servers find it necessary to bring out the appetizers followed immediately by the main course???? By the time I'm finished, the main entree is cold! Common sense, folks!  The green curry was the best dish of the meal, fully of artery blocking coconut milk, this baby had ooomph!  Hot, savory, filled with tender beef and lots of veggies!  The pad thai was average at best, I sensed no love in this dish, just a pile of noodles...no distinct veggies, no crunchy peanuts on the top...no scallions either. The taste was better than the looks, I'd give it a C+ if i was forced to grade.  Good news is that they are open until 9 and take plastic, bad news; no beer/wine is served. We brought our own sensing that we would be out of luck in the beer/wine dept and were told we were not allowed to drink it as they don't have a BYO license. I didn't know there was such a thing. Phoenix is nothing like Chicago as for as a preponderance of BYOs. I wish it were. Oh well that is another discussion for another day.  The service was efficient, too efficient in my opinion.  I would definitely come back, but ONLY for take out, where in can eat at my own pace, have a beer with dinner, and dine in the air-conditioned comfort of my own home.  There are other Thai restaurants in the area, I'm anxious to compare.",

If we lived here it would be our go to Thai restaurant. We had Tom Ka Kai soup. The broth is terrific and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked. We also had Salmon Pineapple red curry medium spicy. My lips are burning and my stomach is happy. Very tasty. The mixed veggies is garlic sauce, also medium spicy, was yummy. The garlic sauce tastes and smells wonderful, and it is a really good mix of veggies. Can't say enough good things about this place.",

Also I know someone who can't get enough of their rice noodle soup. It's a family owned business so it's always the same people working, and they're all very friendly and nice. It is a pretty casual place so they can be a bit slow taking your order sometimes, but once you order the food comes out pretty quick. It's usually never crowded so that helps, but they seem to have a lot of pick up orders. I'm also really happy they're open on Sundays now!",

I've had some phenomenal yellow curry and the yellow curry at La's was just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I definitely want to try some of their other dishes but I won't be rushing back for their curry anytime soon.",

It is right by work, so it is super convenient and their grilled calamari salad is so flavorful and filling, that once I take a bite, I crave it for the rest of my AZ visit.  Here is my problem: their food is great and I have really enjoyed everything I've had there, but the last time I was there I got the WORST food poisoning of my entire life. While on travel for work, sick as a dog, not able to even drink water for days, stuck in a hotel room, and losing critical days of onsite work time - my stomach is still not 100%.  So how do I rate this place? On the flavor, I'd give 4 stars easy. But, I can't offer my recommendation in case someone else gets sick. (I had the coconut soup and the fresh spring rolls when I got sick). I did call them the next day and let them know, and they apologized, but that was it.   So... if you want to risk it, and stick with fully cooked food, you may get a nice Thai meal. Or you may go on what I am now calling \"The Salmonella Diet\".  :-X",

    "text": "A nice little surprise - glad I gave it a try! Though it's in a strip mall in south Scottsdale, it's actually quite charming inside: nicely decorated with a warm, inviting staff. And since I'm a Panang Curry fiend (seriously I order it most everywhere I go for Thai, especially on a first visit -- it's kind of the bar by which I measure a Thai place), I ordered it here. And I was pleasantly surprised! At first when they told me there were only 3 levels of spiciness, I was a bit worried. I usually order 8 out of 10, because I love it spicy but sometimes \"Thai hot\" can be just a touch too spicy for me. But too bland is dull, so I went with option 3.  Not only was their Panang curry (I got it with shrimp) at least as good as anywhere else in the Valley, the spiciness was deliciously complex, and had a little something I don't recall tasting in other Thai, which added something special to it. Kind of an aromatic nut-like spicy flavor -- just a hint of it -- within the typical Panang curry flavor. The balance of spices and heat was perfect. I would definitely eat here again - though I live on the other side of town. The atmosphere and decor are on the elegant side of casual -- so it's not really a date night kind of place, but would be great for a casual lunch or dinner with friends or even a casual business lunch. The Thai tea was good, too!",

    "text": "This location has always been some sort of Asian-inspired restaurant for as long as I can remember. They never seem to last, and quite frankly they've never really been all that good. It seems like FINALLY this has changed with La's Thai!   I'm not sure how long La's has been here, but mom has been ordering takeout from this place pretty regularly for quite awhile now and always has good things to say about it. A couple months ago when I was home for a visit we tried ordering from here, but discovered they were closed on Sundays. When I was here over the Christmas holiday we tried again (the day before Christmas Eve) and were successful.   My mom suggested that we split some spring rolls and Panang curry. Now, I'm a big eater and was skeptical about one appetizer and one entree being enough to split, but my mom insisted this would be more than enough food, and per usual she was correct! This place gives you a TON of curry...and it's delicious! Split between two people we still had leftovers. There are a a lot of vegetables (that taste fresh) and the chicken was tender. The spring rolls were yummy as well, and surprisingly not too greasy.   When I went to go pick up our order the place wasn't that big, but I actually thought it looked pretty nice and I wouldn't hesitate to dine-in with a few friends. The food is affordable and if the other entrees are the same portions as the curry, you certainly get your moneys worth.   One thing I have to say about this place (and for me this isn't a bad thing at all), is IMO the curry is a bit on the spicy side (but I like mine spicy!). I generally find Thai curry to be less spicy than Indian curry and I ordered \"medium\" (with the other options being \"mild\" or \"spicy\") to balance things out for me and mom (who has been know to find \"mild\" salsa to be spicy), and it had a good kick. She later informed me that she normally orders mild from La's, but she was able to handle it.   When I'm back visiting the 'rents, I'll definitely come back to La's Thai!",

I've also tried the red curry, green curry, spicy eggplant, tom kha gai, and pad Thai, and everything is great. The portions are definitely large enough to make two meals/servings.

    "text": "La Thai and Lao Thai are almost similar in name, and they are also very close by in location.  I am not sure if the owners are the same (something I probably will ask next time).  Nevertheless, La Thai is another spectacular authentic Thai cuisine.  I didn't dine here, but the seating space and size of the restaurant is a little smaller.  It is a coincidence that I ordered for take-out.  I ordered the Pad Kra Pow Spicy Basil Chicken and Larb Chicken Salad.  I was very pleased with both dishes.  I ordered medium, and the food was a little mild.   I have to probably say spicy or specify that I am Indian and have a Thai best friend.  Nevertheless, the flavors were tangy and flavorful like many of the Thai restaurants I have been to in LA.",

    "text": "Ive had two things from here.   Spicy Basil Chicken: Meh.  Didnt really taste like basil at all, save for when I actually got a basil leaf in with my chicken bite, which was like three times.  Flavor lacking, but it was definitely edible.  The chicken was cooked wonderfully. Peanut chicken:  Fuck you, La's Thai cuisine.  It was chicken rolled in peanut butter.  I am not kidding.  I ate a glob of peanut butter with chicken.  It was chunky peanut butter too.  No other seasonings could have been involved.  Pretty sad about it, drenched it in Siracha and soy sauce to no avail.   I will not be eating here again.",

    "text": "La's occupies the former Pho Tay Do space though they have done a great job of updating with wood paneling and paint. The Mr and I love Thai food so it's been on our radar for some time. So after finally trying it we've decided it's our new favorite Thai place.   The elements are working to their benefit.. friendly service, great prices and large portions of high quality ingredients. We started with 2 salads, huge mistake. The salads are so large that we could have just split one but no.. we ordered the Larb (ground meat salad) as well as the Yum-Woon-Sen (ground meat and glass noodle salad). Just a heads up, if you don't like fish sauce be sure to ask them not to use it. We also asked for them to be hot.. you'll have to love spice cause these are HOT!!.. I had tears running down my face, it was so spicy! Awesome!! Both salads were tasty just make sure you ask about the fish sauce.  We also tried the Fresh Rolls.. you know the drill, rice paper housing noodles shrimp etc.. these were very fresh and tasty though the peanut dipping sauce was phenomenal! Then paired with the roasted chile powder added a complex smokiness to each bite.. Ill be going back for these for sure!!  Entree's.. the Mr ordered Pad Thai, while very very good it was still just pad Thai.. I ordered Kang-Kra-Ri which was a yellow curry with tofu, coconut milk, pumpkin, potatoes and onions.. oh hell yeah! This was one of the best curries Ive had in a very long time! Silky smooth creamy goodness!   You know us.. we over ordered way to much food which was alright here cause now we have lunch for tomorrow! Woohoo! Im such a porker!",

The curry has a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies always have the right amount of crunch. I also love the chow mein, orange chicken and spicy fried rice. The restaurant is very clean and you can see into the kitchen which also looks clean. My food is always ready in about 10 minutes for take out and the service is very friendly.",

Started with crab and cream cheese wantons and excellent choice; so hot (from fryer) could barely pickup, but couldn't wait for the goodness. Second was the Thai fried rice with tomatoes and cucumber - excellent as were the pan fried noodles. If all that wasn't enough, we order TWO orders of orange chicken (our favorite) and it came at the end which was perfect, since it's as much a dessert as an entree. Sweet and perfectly fried with a light batter that is golden and delicious. Will continue to return many times as it always meets expectations.",

I ordered it 2/5 spicy and probably could have gone 4/5. I though I could spice it up later with chili if i wanted. The service was great. While busy the food expediter lady spent a few minutes talking went over and above with her hospitality and service. My friend ordered a Thai tea and it looked so good I got one to go. It was the best I've had.  I highly recommend everything.",
