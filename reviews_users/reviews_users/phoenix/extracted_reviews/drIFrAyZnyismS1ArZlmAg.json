    "text": "I'm in turmoil on who I should rate this place. The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in, like sulfur or rotten eggs. Then the decor is like 1980's, with the white chairs. Oy - then there's the service. I'm gluten-free, and I had some trouble getting that across. She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it, so she recommended the tofu dishes. I ended up getting the tofu dish with rice noodles and vegetables. I have no idea if there was wheat in the sauce, but at that point in the meal, I really didn't care. I just wanted to order and get the experience over with.   The food came out pretty quickly though. My friend got the spicy cha cha (that looks like shrimp but is actually yam) and it was SUPER spicy and I think it tasted like Long John Silver's fried shrimp basket. BUT she really liked it. My dish was pretty okay, although a little bland. The veggies weren't really great either, but for a vegan dish that's less than $10, I guess it was okay.  I had planned on getting dessert, but we were given the check even before she asked if we wanted dessert. After I made some statement about it she asked if we wanted any, and told us they only had two out of the four desserts on the menu anyways. We went without it.  And yes, they do have the TV running strange vegan propaganda. Very strange, and I don't really want to look at baby pigs while I dine, but it could have been weirder. I guess.   SO - for the price, I guess it is decent vegan cuisine. I guess I wouldn't really know seeing as how I LOVE MEAT, but hey, I'm up for trying everything once. I think if the atmosphere and service was better I would have actually liked the dining experience and the food more. If it was better inside, I'd be tempted to go to this place again. Eventually, I'd like to try the dessert. If they offer it to me.",

The space itself is much lighter, and I feel more welcome by the staff. I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health.  I have tried the spicy cha cha twice (it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp) and it is FANTASTIC. I have also had the raw salad, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, one of the noodle soups, and the stuffed tomatoes. All were good, but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor. Great portion sizes.  They do not serve alcohol, but have some really fun concoctions to drink. Try the \"Pink Lady\" or the delightful \"Sunny Forest.\"",

They also gave me a complimentary cup of lentil soup because they do that during lunch.  The lentil soup tasted fine too and it was nice that it came out first because I was cold.  The wonton soup was good, especially the wonton filling.  The fries were good standard fast food type fries, but not too greasy.  The banh mi, while not the best I ever had, was all right, although it tasted more like French dip.  The bread did go really well with the soup, though.  I am excited to go back and try more dishes.",

    "text": "Here's the honest truth on this place: Good food, nice service, somewhat odd decor.   I typically order for pick-up, so I haven't had too much experience eating in this restaurant. On the few occasions that I have been there I have found the servers to be polite and obliging, the food to be hot & tasty, and the restaurant to be clean. Yes, the restaurant does have a religious affiliation that it makes very clear - TV is playing a video on loop, posters of the \"Supreme Master\" - but, I honestly didn't find it to be as \"creepy\" or intense as other posters have claimed. I think of it like a family owned Italian or Mexican joint - sometimes there are cultural or religious icons there, too.   Anywho - back to the food. If you are vegan or vegetarian you MUST try this place at least once. After living in NY for a while I mourned Phoenix's lack of vegetarian/vegan food, but then I found Loving Hut. While I can't vouch for everything on the menu - I have tried quite a bit and I swear - it gets better every time I eat it! I am a huge fan of the Sage Lemongrass, Mongolian Delight, and Sweet & Sour Divine. YUM.  One word of warning - If you are familiar with other Loving Huts: The menu is completely different. I have been to three of these restaurants now and have seen the menu range from Asian inspired to a more Mexican Vibe. This particular restaurant rocks an Asian/American feel. Additionally, some of the names of the dishes are different from venue to venue, so be aware when ordering.",

    "text": "For my visit, I walked in on Sunday night at 7:32. No one greeted me for 14 minutes. Not exaggerating. I was surprised since I assumed I would at least see a worker around. One appeared around 7:39 to give some people their take away food, but no one approached me. Maybe their staff quit today and they only had one worker?  Not great since I had driven 20 minutes to get here. I have been eating vegan for about 16 years and was curious to try their fare.  When I was approached, and I told the gal that I had been waiting for so long, she apologized. But she did not offer any compensation for my troubles. I would expect her to comp the meal at least. At least.  Plus some guy had his dog inside the restaurant and it was not a seeing eye dog. Gross. Trying to be \"cool\"? Keep your dang dogs away from my food. Maybe I should contact the health department?  I left without ordering/eating because of the terrible service here. However I am sure they were relieved...it meant they would not have to stay late. Whew! Oh well, it's only one bad Yelp review. Maybe it won't get noticed!  Vegans, I suggest staying away from here until it gets sold to new owners who care more about service.  You know what they say: a good experience means you tell on average, 1 person, but a bad experience means you tell on average, 11 people. Yikes. Is that worth a free meal? Uh, I think so. Plus the lifetime value of a new customer could easily add up to $500+ a year. If that worth a free burger? Uhm, yeah.",

For those of you who really enjoyed the Vegetarian House of old, don't worry.  This is still the same place run by Supreme Master Ching Hai--it's just that the chain has changed names.  The food has changed very little.  The dishes here still have the same high quality and wonderful taste that they always had.  Their lemongrass vegan \"chicken\" and fried rice are just incredible.

    "text": "I've been going here for years and sadly will not return. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai, but I have been noticing it lacks the consistency in flavor it used to have. Sometimes it's too sweet, tart, not spicy enough, not creamy enough, not the same. Today me and my friend ordered it and the flavors and colors were different. I preferred hers, but that isn't how a restaurant is supposed to work. That sucked. What a horrible feeling to be salivating at your dining mate's plate and you ordered the same thing! But to add insult to injury was the service. I ordered one of my favorite cakes, the pandan. I prefer the desserts at the Glendale location, but theirs aren't too bad and they happened to have my favorite cake. I excitedly took a bite and begrudgingly swallowed a sweet, soapy, gross tasting confectionery disaster. I had to send it back.  I told the server the problem, she took it away, and I figured it was resolved. Nope. She informs someone who appears to be a manager and they proceed to try to give me an education about Pandan cake, a cake I have had countless times before. Clearly they were insulted that I said it tasted soapy, but did I really need to see google images of the pandan leaf? Or a long story about how it is a special cake that was homemade? A simple apology would have sufficed. A few minutes after my pandan education, a small woman came peeking out at me. It was clear they were talking about me. I suspect it was the baker of the cake. Once again a simple apology would have sufficed. Instead they stood out near the kitchen and possibly attempted to curse me in Vietnamese for THEIR ill tasting cake. My dining mate still had a sweet tooth and decided to order their carrot cake. All was kind of normal until the check came. On the check I was charged $6.50 for the carrot cake. No where on the menu or their specials board is there a cake for $6.50. They do have an overpriced raw cheesecake for $7, but that's another matter. Their menu clearly states all of their cakes are $5. Tell me why I had to bring this to their attention and when they still tried to play me I actually had to read it for them. Eventually they took off the $1.50, but why was it there in the first place? Bitterness and the worst customer service is the answer. I used to really enjoy the food and service at this Loving Hut location, but now I won't return. I will never forget how nasty their attitudes were, almost like that awful cake. I added a star for Nostalgia.",

The water was refreshing! They have freshly sliced oranges in it!  Then about 10 minutes after that we ordered. If you're keeping track, we has been here about 25-30 mins at this point. We shared the dumplings, I had the sweet and sour divine, and he had the Garlic sensation.  The lentil soup they serve with the meal was yummy! And the dumplings can satisfy in insatiable appetite for all things dumpling. I have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings. Mmm, dumpling.   They serve Stash jasmine green tea, which I loved. The soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good, nonetheless. I could make a tastier meat sub, myself  And holy hell, they do not know what a sense of urgency is! We had to leave and said, \"we're running late, can you go ahead and run our bill?\" Note, we has already finished eating and had not even been visited for a check.

I've been to all vegan (this place is no, but is close) Chinese restaurants in NY, Philly and Boulder, and was hoping that this would be similar.  It took us three tries to even get to eat here, as they have odd hours to start with, and seemed to be closed sometimes when their sign said that they should be open.  The first time, we were the ONLY people in the whole place, and it still took us 45 minutes to get served, and another 20 from when we were done until we could get our check. The second visit, there were other people there, but there were more servers, and it took, no kidding, over an hour to even get our soup. AN HOUR.  Our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that.  The food? It's ok.  It's not amazing, but as a vegetarian, it's nice to know that you can eat anything on a menu. The Mushroom Hot Pot was ok but a little bland. I liked the steamed dumplings, but the sauce was a bit odd.  Don't forget the odd TVs all around the place playing interesting cult-like clips about Supreme Master Ching Hai and his biddings. Which is kinda cool to begin with, but when you're sitting there for an hour or two, it gets a bit old.  I really wanted to like this place, but I can't.

    "text": "The adage that a bad experience is more likely to spread than a good one holds ever True.  Having had good experiences with other Loving Hut locations before, my wife and I decided to try this one and meet a friend for dinner on a Friday night.  There were about 8 other parties seated.  The first thing to notice was that it seemed like there was only one server on staff.  Not sure if this was a unique situation, but reading the other review of poor service it seems this is commonplace.  She took our orders, and brought out the Thai Iced Tea I ordered pretty quickly.  Then we proceeded to wait about 50 minutes for her to come out with my wife's entree, and to tell me that the kitchen staff couldn't make my order because of a lack of ingredients.  50 minutes...and all we have to show is 1 out of 3 entrees and they clearly hadn't even started on ours if she was telling me they couldn't make it.  I ordered something else...then she comes out 10 minutes later telling me they could make it after all.  I ordered something called the Royal Noodle Soup, and not only was it lacking in flavor, but it seemed like someone just chopped up pieces of lemongrass and left it in the soup and called it a day.  My wife and her friend's entree were nothing to write home about either.  Needless to say we won't be back.",

Wonderful menu with mostly Asian influence. Huge portions, and the veggie meat was quite tasty. We ordered the spring rolls, the pad thai and the NY charm. I absolutely loved the ny charm, and the pad thai was ok.  I WILL be back to try some more of their meatless creations!",

It was still pretty good but you'd assume the same company would have similar ingredients. Bummer but I still like you guys.",

When I ordered I was asked if I mind waiting 40 minutes because they were busy. I thought that was a long time for a carry out but ok I did. I got there after 50 minutes and I was asked to pay for my meal. I asked if my food was ready. I was told it was not. I asked how long until it would be ready, 20 minutes, 30? The woman behind the counter shook her head yes and just said \" I don't know what's wrong with the kitchen tonight\"? She said it with a smile on her face. No apology, no nothing. I walked out. Not nice at all. So at 7 pm I had to search for something to eat already waiting 50 minutes. I will not go back.  Oh and the inside looks like a bowling alley form the 70's. The only thing missing was someone smoking.",

    "text": "Tak about a bummer of a meal. My hubby and I were in Scottsdale from CA for a weekend getaway and we're on a plant based diet right now (not usually vegetarian / vegan), and the good reviews for the Loving Hut drew us in for Valentine's Day dinner.   Food was actually delicious. Like I said, we are not even vegan but it was good. I had the Spicy Cha Cha (super breaded, which I didn't realize, but it was good). Hubby had the Clay Pot, and we also started with the wontons.   Service is why I can't give this place more than two stars. It took FOREVER to get our food. I'm not exaggerating when I say it took more than an hour from when we ordered to when hubby's food came out. And another 15 min for mine! He was done before mine came out. And yeah, it was crowded, but not the typical crazy you see at other places on Valentine's Day.   I'm not giving it one star because at least one waitress - not ours mind you, a different one - noticed me sitting there with no food as hubby finished, so she inquired with us. When we told her mine never came out, she checked on it, eventually bringing it out and also taking it off the bill.   Anyway, that was our experience. Good food, very very very slow, subpar service, with the exception of one nice waitress who went out of her way to check on us. We wouldn't return, even if we did live in the area.",

The pad thai was okay... I was honestly not very impressed by it. It was a bit soggy and meh. However, the sweet and sour was incredible. I wish we had ordered two plates of that!  I do not normally find myself a fan of faux meats but the flavour was spot on and was absolutely delicious.   The only real complaint I have was that it took FOREVER. Our drinks took at least 15 minutes to get, while our food another 45 minutes after waiting 30 for appetizers. They servers were incredibly kind and apologetic as they had two cooks and a restaurant FULL of people. We were starving so it was little annoying as we just wanted to eat when we arrived. But that all being said, the wait was well worth it.   I would love to go back and try something else. Also, the chai matcha type drink was so good!!",

    "text": "This place sucks!!! It's so expensive for so-so quality of food... We ordered \"spicy\" but there was not a single chili in our dish. Every dish was salty and didn't taste very good (not good enough for the price for sure).   But we are most upset about the horrible customer service. We complained to them that the price was wrong (that they charged us too much) but they said it was actually too little (can you believe it?) and they made the price even higher!!!!! They said it was their mistake they had forgotten to charge us for the rice.   When we ordered the entrees, the waitress asked us which kind of rice we wanted, brown or white, so we assumed all dishes came with rice. They didn't inform us that we had to pay extra for rice. It was so confusing.   We are vegan and always go to many locations of Loving Hut in many cities around the world and I have to say that this has been the worst experience dining at Loving Hut ever! Not a chance we will go back there.   It was their mistake to start with and they still dared to change the price to even higher after we had complained about being charged wrong. It was such an incredibly rude service. Who would do this to a customer? These guys should learn the art of customer service from Starbucks. If I could give it zero star, I would.  If you have a car, go to Loving Hut in Tempe (near ASU). It's just a bit down the south. I love all the staff members there including the owner. They are all \"extremely\" nice. We were very very impressed with their service. They changed the orders according to our requests (replaced soy protein with tofu, cooked without onions etc.) and really made the food spicy. They also let us use their private bathroom etc. Customer service is a huge factor to a great dining experience. If you care to have a good experience, choose the Tempe location. Just so much better!!!",

It's kind of a crowded Saturday night so we weren't too impatient about it taking a little while.   We waited about 30 minutes and the first dish came out.  Then another 15 minutes and the second dish came out.  And THEN another 10 minutes finally our last dish came out only after asking the server about it because it had been a full 50 minutes since we ordered and I had noticed that guests who came in long after us were getting their dishes. They apologized, but my other friends had already completely finished their meals before mine even arrived and then we paid the ridiculous prices for it all. I'm so disappointed with the service even though the food was great. I will not be returning to this location at all.",

The Pork rolls were amazing - hands down one of the tastiest things i've had in a while. Turns out that my husband could not eat them due to the peanuts hiding in there, (note to Allergy people) but he got a good taste of it and agreed that it was good. His dinner was the best - the \"seafood\" having the right consistancy (something that felt like squid, a \"shrimp\" that was very close to shrimp flavor, and something that I swear tasted like the chinese sasuage from my youth - yummm!) and the sauce tasty and not too salty. My Ginger duck was too salty - the consistancy was ok, but the salt was just too much. After dinner, we ordered the Flan (which was the main reason that we came here in the first place). Sadly, like many veg/vegan restaurants, the dessert was awful. I think the \"flan\" was agar agar with some applejuice and some brown rice syrup. It was WAY TOO SWEET and looked (and felt) just like snot. Totally non appetising - icky jellowish texture. Service was a bit slow..but I think they view it as \"laid back\". The atmosphere was lacking as well - bright lights, cafeteria feel. I'd higly suggest for them to bring in more plants, paint the walls something other than pale pink, and tone down those overhead lights. This is not a date spot - just a good place for tasty food.",

The chow fun was tasty, fried rice was nothing special, the lemongrass mock meat dish was just like how we remember it back when it was Suma Ching Hai. The clay pot sensation was like severely salted tofu. It was so salty it's hard to swallow. The food was ok, nothing exciting. The ambiance was really quiet. We were pretty much the first party there that evening. The first thing my toddler said was \"where is everybody\". We told her the evening just started. What we did not anticipate was that they intend to keep it that quiet. Half way through dinner, my 8 weeks old baby started crying. He is not even the loud type, and he only cries in discomfort. While I was busy grabbing a bite so that I could take over the baby, and my husband was trying to sooth our baby, the waitress came over to my ear and told me to take the baby away to a corner to not disturb the other diners. I was furious. My quiet, good natured husband was so pissed that he dropped his dinner, paid up and we left. All the time, the big screen tv was playing and advertising about Supreme Master Ching Hai and her kindness. Wow! Talking about hypocrisy. Her restaurant cannot tolerate a less than 2 months old baby's primal and innocent cry. I was so excited about Loving Hut for months and that was our first visit. It is also our last. We are vegans for compassionate reasons. This establishment preaches kindness but has zero substance. We will not return.",

I like when waitstaff has an opinion about the food, especially when the food is unfamiliar.  The veggies are crunchy and the sauces are not too glooey,  too sweet or salty, as some Chinese sauces can be.  It would be nice if they turned down the lights a bit so it feels less like a school cafeteria.  The video promoting veganism and a supreme leader are heavy handed and well, frankly, weird.

    "text": "I give the Loving Hut 5 stars mostly because of their Sweet and Sour Divine entree. It's like a mock sweet and sour chicken meal. I've visited the hut twice and although planned on trying something different on my second visit, ordered the Sweet and Sour once again. My matey enjoyed the Royal Noodle soup which was spicy, lemongrassy, and topped with plenty of cilantro. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing with a wall of windows spreading soft light throughout the interior. I noticed that a few people have complained about the religious video (possibly Buddhism? Didn't pay much attention) playing on the widescreen. I say who cares, no one is forcing you to convert to anything. From my experience throughout my lifetime almost everyone preaches something that they believe in one way or another. For me this was about the food, nothing else. Unless they are poisoning the food with some mind controlling substance, who cares!",

I came in with a good attitude, ready to acknowledge ( if not worship outright) all appropriate deities - but left a bewildered non believer.    We endured baffling service, and it pains me to say it, because there was not a hint of rudeness. Just communication obstacles that I suspect involved more than language. To make a long story short, we had no idea what we ordered, despite numerous attempts to probe our waitress for such rudimentary information.  It was comic, really, until the food arrived.   My mother's Vietnamese entree was more a Greek tragedy of inedibly chewy mock chicken (she had asked several times for something easy to chew). Mine was better, but I've forgotten what it was.  The Seventh Heaven Salad was ok (more like third or fourth heaven) and we both liked the cup of complimentary chicken soup. That was a nice touch, and something we could all understand.   It took several minutes to communicate that we wanted a knife. I ordered  Thai iced tea, which unbeknownst to me was 'code' for ice water. It's hard to get too mad though.  Despite the confusion, it's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around.  People seemed nice, in an interplanetary way. We had what amounted to a disappointing pot luck, and the service was extraordinarily weird.   Bon appetit !!",

The staff are friendly and helpful, the decor is unique and the Supreme Master TV is interesting, and if you don't like it, it's never too loud and you can get a table away from the television.  For appetizers, my favorite are the Summer Rolls, but the Spring Rolls and the Moo Shu Vegetables are delicious as well.  My favorite entree is the Sweet and Sour Divine, but I'm also a fan of the Philly Dream sandwich, the Stuffed Tomatoes, the Sage Lemongrass, the Noble Broccoli and the Clay Pot Sensation. My boyfriend is also big fan of the Ginger Seaweed Ocean, but it's not really my thing.  The cheesecake is pretty good, my boyfriend really goes nuts over it. Also, the pink lady is pretty good, but I usually get water because I'm poor and water is pretty delicious, though tragically underrated.",

    "text": "I went looking for this place once about three weeks ago and had trouble finding it. When we did find it, we realized it was because it is now Loving Hut. We called last weekend and they told us that they were re-opening this past Tuesday (7/20/2010). We went back yesterday for dinner.  The place is nice and quiet and very white--white walls, white chairs, white tables, white dishes, white everything! I'm not sure if this is intentional, so whatever. The lady who sat us was nice, but we only saw her for about two seconds before a grumpy waitress came over. It may have been the language barrier or that she kept giving us what looked like Stink Eye the whole time we ordered. She also kept asking me if I was sure I wanted the Royal Noodle Soup because it was supposedly \"real spicy.\" It wasn't, in case you're wondering.   They have a TV going with all kinds of Vegan/Religious propaganda, but it didn't really bother me. I can see where others might be turned off from the place though. Our food came out eventually and it was okay. I've had better Vegan Chinese food in Tucson (see, Guilins) with a friendlier staff and better portions and prices.   Some of the other reviewers mentioned they have free tea, but they don't any more. As we were finishing up, someone who must have been a regular was flipping their menu over and over looking for items that are no longer served, I'm guessing. She was asking the waitress if they still had ____ because couldn't find it on their menu (which was already very limited).  It was an interesting experience, but I doubt I'll go back any time soon.",

The best thing about LH is the fact that they sell their veg meats in the stores (along with some of their sauces and an interesting looking seasoning). So the BBQ veg protein I love so much, I now have a bag of it in my kitchen and my waitress even explained how to prepare it (it's a TVP kind of protein so you just rehydrate it).",

However, by the end of the meal, we couldn't really even smell it anymore.  The decor is also strange.  I really didn't like the TV's with the vegan propaganda running.... having been a vegan myself, and also a vegetarian for some years, I've seen it all - but definitely not while I'm eating.  It doesn't matter if it's vegan food, who wants to watch that while they eat???  But!- the saving grace might actually be the food.  It is pretty delicious.  The service was not too bad either.  The server was a pleasant lady who gave me recommendations on the menu.  My boyfriend ordered two of their specialty drinks and they were really yummy.    Overall, the food is good but the atmosphere is lacking.  Service is ok too.  Would I go back?  Probably.

Biggest disappointment was that almost every dish included (or centered around) some sort of soy protein or tofu.  Hello!  There are tons of ways to be delicious vegan dishes that don't include the abomination (to me) that tofu is from a taste and mouthfeel standpoint.  Wife did not like her faux fish entree, the wonton soup was o.k., as was my veggie Mu Shu.  Next time, it's off to Cafe Lalibela, or any good italian or middle eastern place.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of the Loving Hut chain. Each is individually owned & operated, so when visiting a Loving Hut in a new city, for the first time, I try to go in with no real expectations as far as the menu is concerned.  When I moved to PHX last year I tried this location.  I ordered the Hawaiian Burger & the golden wontons to go. To my dismay, the \"burger\" wasn't a burger at all. It was a weird white-looking soy substance, which I couldn't identify, & my golden wontons were more like blackened. I was put off & did not return for a long while.   For some reason, maybe it was the sweet little ladies who work there, I felt compelled to give them another try. I am SO glad I did. Major improvements across the board, & they have recently revamped their menu.     My fav appetizers: - Golden Wontons have been consistently fried to golden perfection.  - Pan-fried Dumplings are yummy & the sauce is delicious.   Fav entrees: - Guru Fried Rice is so addictively (not a real word) delicious. Something about that curry spice on the brown rice (you can choose white or brown rice); I can't go a week without it!  - Noble Broccoli, is a vegan \"beef\" & broccoli dish. The soy beef is savory, and the broccoli, though crunchy, is soaked in a mouth-watering brown sauce. My non-veg*n friends really love this dish.   - Sweet & Sour Divine is their vegan sweet & sour chicken. It's simply perfect. The \"chicken\" is encased in perfectly battered & fried balls, dressed in a classic sweet & sour sauce, with pineapples, red & green peppers, & onions. So yummy!  - Spicy Cha Cha, which reminds me of shrimp, less the fleshy, fishy taste. It is very flavorful, and the menu now offers tartar sauce as an option. I tried it this way last week & went back 3 more times afterwards! Some of the best vegan tartar sauce around! Also with the new menu, this dish is now offered with your choice of fries or steamed veggies. Get it with fries for a \"fish & chips\" type meal. This dish is yam based, as opposed to soy, so it's also a good option for those who avoid soy.   - Loving Lemongrass is hard to describe. Thin slices of lightly breaded faux chicken deliciously seasoned. Muy sabrosa! Kinda like Pringles; once you pop, you can't stop!   The entree portions are plentiful and I always have left overs (unless I'm sharing my dish).  If you're in the mood for a sandwich, try the new Ocean Sandwich. I was a little skeptical at first but it was so good! That amazing tartar sauce really compliments this sandwich; I asked for extra sauce. Yum!   Speaking of that tartar sauce (again)... The menu offers a side of yam protein, which is basically a plain version of the Spicy ChaCha pieces. Be sure to ask for it fried, with a side of fries and Voila: a fried shrimp & fries basket. Don't forget the tartar sauce!!  The Hawaiian burger is one of my favorites from the LH chain. At this location you have to ask for a \"burger\" patty, otherwise you'll get that funky white soy patty, which I've just learned is supposed to be a \"chicken\" patty. (Get the burger patty instead & leave happy.)  Is it dessert time? Good, because Loving Hut has one of the BEST vegan cheesecakes on earth. Seriously. Been around the world and I-I-I, I can't find a vegan cheesecake this good! That's all I'll say. Try it! Yummy ice cream flavors too: chocolate, cherry chocolate chip, vanilla. If you avoid soy, ask for the ice cream made with coconut milk.   When you dine in you get a yummy bowl of hot lentil soup. The drinking water is fruit-infused, usually with oranges; it's very refreshing. Service is not fast, so if you have a set or timed lunch break, you'll want to call ahead for a carry out order.  (They have Eco-friendly to-go containers.) My food is always hot & fresh, and I'm typically in no hurry so I have no complaints regarding the wait.   The owners are so sweet and friendly; they always greet you with smiling faces. The decor is simple and elegant; it has a very peaceful ambiance.   So to sum it up, this Loving Hut has become one of my all time favorite dining spots. Awesome vegan food that will please & satisfy veg*ns & omnivores alike.",

Inside the restaurant is minimalistic and pretty clean throughout. All the employees looked happy to be there and not dreading working which was nice to see, our waitress was nice, always filling and asking if we needed water. The wait was quite long though. I understand it was New Years Eve but there wasn't a whole lot of people in the restaurant for the amount of time we had to wait which was around 30 minutes for two dishes of the curry. We each got the curry with rice and it was delicious! Probably the best curry I've had. It was worth the wait though which in the end I would definitely come back here just for the curry!",

I had the Heaven Rice Rolls and the Pad Thai. Both were beautifully presented and SO delicious. The tofu on my Pad Thai was much more flavorful than tofu usually is elsewhere.   Most importantly, I got a chocolate milkshake to go on my way out, and OH MY GOSH. I've been vegan for a year now, and I don't think I've had a milkshake the entire time. It was amazing. I thought I was full from dinner but I definitely finished the whole thing within 10 minutes. Amazing.  Can't wait to come back and try more of what they have to offer!",

    "text": "Average vegan Asian food. Not bad, not terribly tasty. If you like processed protein, you will love this place, because just about every dish serves tofu or veggie protein or yam protein (say wha?). You can however make requests for soy-free and gluten-free.   It's a nice quiet restaurant painted white inside with several tables set for three or four people. The servers are very lax and friendly. Also the menu is colorful with pictures.  Appetizers:  Rainbow salad - Very light dressing covering a mound of exceptionally thin sliced cabbage and veggies. It's topped with slices of veggie protein but I ate around those. Otherwise, a very good salad.  Spring Rolls - Veggie protein is chopped up and mixed in well enough so that it would take too long to pick out. They looked good, but I avoided them. Tasted the accompanying house made peanut sauce and found it to be very weak.  Dumplings - Also looked very good but the veggie protein was blended in so I avoided them. The accompanying house made sauce was very weak.  French fries - Thinly sliced, fried right, and served with basic ketchup.  Entree:  In order to avoid soy and the processed stuffs, I ordered the broccoli-mushroom dish and made special request for a plain eggplant dish. Either brown or white rice could be requested as an addition to the meal, but I opted for a side of noodles. Glad I did.   Also, glad I ordered two dishes because ended up combining them into one, just to get a full meal. The mushrooms were awfully rubbery; they went to waste. So I paired the broccoli florets with my eggplant and stirred in the noodles. That was good.   Beverage:  Orange juice with mint flavor and topped with flowers. I thought the orange was going to be fresh, but it tasted like it was straight from a carton. (That is the last time I believe a server who says the restaurant sells fresh juice.) The mint was an artificially dark green colored overly sweet syrup at the bottom of the glass. Not worth it.  Dessert:  Slice of maple cinnamon cake. A-Okay. Not too thick and not overly sweet. A trained tongue can tell that it's vegan.",

I would give more stars but the service has a lot to be desired.     We have been sitting here long enough to write this Yelp review, even asking if we are gonna service and I was ignored.    20 minutes later we waited on when they close for lunch in 36 minutes. Usually the food takes 30 minutes to get to you from the time you order.   Good food but this place needs to be only for take out if you don't mind waiting an hour to get your order.  There 3 tables seated with at most 3 people at each. A group of 3 left as we walked in.",

Everything is vegan and it was nice and quiet on a Sunday evening. The waitress kind of rushed me (because I was taking so long choosing a meal) but otherwise everyone was very friendly. I got the golden spring rolls appetizer. They're so good but very greasy. They came with a spicy mustard that tastes like wasabi or maybe horseradish. They also came with a sweet chili sauce. I also had the spicy cha cha for my entree. It is like a faux shrimp, which wasn't what I expected. It wasn't as spicy as I expected either. I wasn't crazy about it so I traded dinners with my boyfriend and ate his coconut curry instead, which was AMAZING. I'll definitely be back to try everything else on the menu. Before we left, we picked up a couple bags of spicy TVP jerky to take home.",

There is an overwhelming flavor of nut that just tastes like curry noodles, so just be aware of that. the other thing was that a thai tea as $3.50 and it was very small. I have had larger portions for less money and it was just okay.   Overall, not happy with my experience but for the right person, I'm sure this is a great place!",

I enjoyed the new age decor and videos playing, as well as the message of compassion and kindness that was perpetuated on the walls, in the music, etc. This place is not just for vegans!  Food: Yum! We didn't miss the meat/animal products at all. I got the famous Pad Thai (gluten free!), which did not disappoint. It was flavorful, aromatic, and delicious. I also had enough to take home! My husband got the Sweet & Sour Divine, and really enjoyed the veg protein. He ate his all in one sitting, but had a hard time doing so (: We were told that other favorite picks were the Spicy Cha Cha (it's supposed to taste just like shrimp), Royal Noodle Soup, and Ocean Sandwich.  Service: The staff all give off somewhat strange vibes (as mentioned in other reviews). They're not unfriendly, but they're definitely not any friendlier than they have to be, and it seems like they don't want you to be there. They'll offer suggestions if asked, and our drinks were refilled regularly, but no one asks how your food is or if you need anything else. They also pretty clearly wanted to kick us out when it got close to closing time, even though we didn't stay after hours.  Of note: They have kind of weird hours, as some other reviewers have mentioned, so make sure you check that they're open before you go. Also, they sell vegan cookies and other bakery goods at the cash register, if that's your jam!",

When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.  Vegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.  The Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.  The Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a True vegan \"junk food\" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).  The Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry. It is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread. It is composed of: curry, taro, carrots, potatoes, gluten, tofu.  The small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water. The Macadamia Carrot Cake $3.95 could have been better if it wasn't so dried out by the refrigerator. It was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them. With: coconut, carrots, turbinado, sugar, macadamia nuts, spices, coconut cream topping.  Please men in the back who kept farting; I know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste. Please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart's content or take it outside. *Disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas.  All items are 100% vegan, all entrees are under $10, all of their delicious organic juices, milks and teas are $3.50-5.00.  It gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait, prepare to wait or come early. Might be hard to pass up but it is right across from Chuy's, and right in the same parking lot as Desert Jade.",

They had a variety of Asian dishes and a few interesting American-inspired entrees for those looking for something different.    I ordered the Heaven Rice Rolls as an appetizer and the BBQ Noodles entree.  Both dishes infused fresh, uncooked veggies into the meal in a way that didn't compromise taste, but didn't leave you feeling regretful afterwards as some oily or fatty meals can.  And the entree, as well as everything on the menu, was under $10! Great quality, healthy vegan food, served by a polite staff, for a reasonable price; that is what you can expect.",

    "text": "We went for the first time in several years and they have renovated since they changed the name - it's clean and bright and wasn't as awkward as it was in the past.  The service was more professional, quick, and friendly and the dishes were well presented.  They weren't that busy for late on a Saturday night so there was no wait.  We got a kick out of the celebrity celebration ceremony on a wall-mounted flat screen honoring the Supreme Master who called into the show versus showing up in person or via video.  The volume was very low and we were a table away so it was hard to hear, but still slightly entertaining.  It's 100% vegan.  I can order anything off the menu without fearing that they will accidentally fling bits of meat into my dish.  Our only complaint about the food is that it is greasy and most of the dishes are based on meat substitutes rather than creative, non-processed, plant-based options.  I read in a forum online that the Supreme Master owns the company that makes the meat substitute products they use (sorry, I don't have more info on that).  We ordered the Summer Roll, which was good, but the tofu is fried.  The Spicy Cha Cha has chunks of breaded and fried meat substitute that tasted so much like imitation crab meat we couldn't believe it was vegan - our server saw us inspecting it and came over and told us the vegan ingredients (must happen often).  The tofu in the Chow Mein was fried too.  Also, the Chow Mein didn't have bean sprouts - they are the reason I crave it.  Next time we go we will try to order healthier options, or non-fried options.  If you are the type of vegetarian/vegan that misses meat-based dishes or you are trying to transition for ethical reasons, this place is perfect.  There are a lot of choices on the menu and they even have vegan desserts.",

Like other reviewers mentioned, yes, the service can be slow at times, especially busy ones, but they are so nice to me and my unsavory sidekick that I don't even care. That and the food make up for it in spades. We almost always order the pad thai, it's glorious. Not a traditional pad thai flavor but even more delicious.

I had the Rainbow Salad before they added the soy ham to it. To be honest, it was pretty bland. Perhaps now that they've added the soy ham it's more flavorful.  On my second visit, I tried the Mongolian Wonder with a side of brown rice and it was delicious. I also got the Delectable Eggplant with a side of brown rice for my husband and although the flavors were nice, it was a little mushy. We wished there were other veggies added in the dish, to balance out the flavors and textures.  Overall, the service is what really stood out as excellent. I am a teacher and was fighting my first cold of the school year, and the gal who helped me offered  her own Throat Coat tea for free and added fresh ginger and candied ginger on the side since it's soothing for a sore throat. Everyone who works at Loving Hut is friendly and quick to get you anything you may need. I love all the vegan options and definitely want to try the Hawaiian veg Burger when I return.",

I used to love this place, but after my last experience, I will never, EVER EVER EVER step foot in this establishment EVER again.  My mom and I went to have lunch here a couple weeks ago. We were eating, everything was fine, and these two men (who happened to be black) came in to dine. They sat at a table and ordered their food. Then the waitress came back out moments later and asked them to pay before they received their food. They were very confused and one of the men politely stated that he didn't really want to pay before receiving his food, and she continued to tell him \"you can pay now.\" She finally walked away from them after they stated they'd prefer to eat their meal before paying. I was truly blown away. Why would you ask anyone to pay before they've received their meal if they're dining in??  I finally had to get up and go to the front to ASK for my check, and I asked the two men if what I saw was really what happened. He said \"yes, they didn't ask you to pay first did they?\" I said \"nope. I'm so sorry this has happened. That's incredibly rude, and so unacceptable.\" We had a short conversation, and I made my way back to my table to gather my things so we could leave. As we were boxing the rest of our food up, another couple came in and sat down. The server immediately brought the new table waters and two bowls of soup, while the two men who had been sitting there for some time, STILL didn't have waters or soup!!! They both got up after witnessing this, and confirming the prejudice that truly was occurring, politely told the cashier to cancel their order. They said thank you to me for noticing what was happening, and they left.  I was truly blown away, and heartbroken at the overt racism I had just witnessed. That is completely unacceptable, ignorant behavior, and I truly hope people read this and they lose business. They should truly be ashamed of themselves. There is absolutely NO excuse for racism!!!!!!!",

They always make us feel like family when we come here - and we really haven't been here for several months. After a mild scolding for dissing them, they apologized in advance for what was to be a backlogged kitchen.  We missed their food, and we also wanted to try some of their newer dishes. We had a little hesitant seeing as that they only had one chef in the back today. But we wanted to try and give it a whirl anyway.  Therefore, we ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings, Wonton Soup, Veggie Delight, Save Our Oceans, and Frank's Veggie Steak and Potatoes. To close it all out, we also ordered the mint chocolate cake, and the Raspebrry Ice Cream.  To sum in all up, every one of these dishes turned out to be scrumptious and fresh! Not a single one of them disappointed us. Even if dinner did take longer than normal, the prompt and consistent check-in from Linda, Diane, and Jenny just kept informed as to their progress.  It may have bothered others, but it certainly wasn't an issue for us.   It really is one of the best Vegan places in town, and their continued efforts to improve on the variety of their dishes just keeps us coming back time and time again - even if there are time lapses in between.  We trust that you will enjoy this place as much as we do!",

Like this one, it's super cozy but not a lot of seating so may or may not want to eat there depending on how crowded it is. I've tried their bahn mis and carrot cake and loved both. Wasn't feeling too well this weekend and ran in for some bread. I made an amazing discovery, didn't see it on their menu but when I asked for a baguette or just some bread they asked if I wanted naan. I got really excited, naan usually has milk and eggs bakes in and is topped with butter so not vegan but they sell vegan naan and it's really good. Other than the bahn mis and app rolls haven't tried too much else on their menu. Everything sounds really good though. Will come back here to try their other dishes and really like their staff, super friendly.",

The tofu in the summer rolls was excellent and I honestly can say that these spring rolls were the best I've ever had. Really scrumptious!  For our entrees, my friend had the \"steak\" and potatoes (she seemed to really enjoy it) and I had the BBQ Noodles.   I thoroughly enjoyed the golden rolls that came atop the rice noodles and the noodles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the vegetable protein \"meat\" slices. Unfortunately, Fresh Mint in Scottsdale does a similar dish and their faux beef is head and shoulders above Loving Hut. It's seriously unparallelled. Perhaps had I not had anything to unfavorably compare it to, I would have loved it though?  I also thought it was weird to include lettuce in a hot noodle dish. They were a totally unnecessary addition.  I ate a few bites and didn't ask for a box which I think offended the woman who waited on us. Sorry ma'am- it just wasn't good, no offense intended. I loved everything else I promise! ;-)  Anyway, for dessert we ordered the raspberry cake and it was so friggin delish...yum, yummity, yummers! It was sweet, super moist and just incredible. Being the sugar fanatic I am, I cannot wait to go back to try their other desserts!  Overall, despite not liking my entree, I was impressed with the majority of the food and their wildly extensive menu and will definitely be back!",

If you like Asian vegetarian food maybe you'll like this place just fine. If you're not interested in tofu disguised as shrimp then maybe you'll not like it at all.  But, I say this is an odd place because I have also heard stories and seen articles that claim that the organization promoted by the Supreme Master is a cult.   Now, I have no idea whether this is True, but it definitely gives you something to think about when you eat your Tofurkey chow mein.",

I was torn between a couple of different dishes that had gluten-free options but I ended up going with the Royal Noodle Soup and I am SO GLAD that I did because that was perhaps one of the best noodle soups I have ever had in my life. Made with a mildly spicy lemongrass broth (I actually expected it to be more spicy since it was indicated to be so on the menu, but that was fine), there were plenty of rice noodles, oyster mushrooms, and tofu to more than fill me up.   Seriously, that broth was so freaking delicious that I wanted to keep sipping on it forever, and I pretty much did until every drop was gone. I was so full that there was no room for dessert and I was glad I didn't order any appetizers because I either wouldn't have been able to finish the soup (which would have been very sad) or I would been so full that I would have been sick.  Yum yum yum yum yum.  Service was also great. I was seated immediately and my server was great with helping me to decide what to get. Definitely on my list to go back to next time I'm in Phoenix!",

A group of us went to Loving Hut for our UYE for Veg-Curious night, and while I'm not vegan, I was really excited to try the food because it was highly recommended by our vegan friends. I ordered a Banh Mi Philly. I was completely shocked that the \"meat\" tasted like meat! In terms of texture, it was closer to sirloin than rib eye, but I wouldn't have guessed that any of it was plant based!  In addition I ordered the Peaceful Pink, a delicious mixture of soy milk, cranberry juice, and rose petals. It sounds so simple, but it was another surprisingly good mix! I was lucky enough to sample some other bites, including the shrimp made from yams, that tasted just like shrimp!  My only complaint with Loving Hut was that it took some time to prepare the food, but in my experience that's to be expected with vegetarian/vegan places. We did have a rather large group with us, and I'll definitely be going back to try more dishes!",

Since I love fried shrimp, I followed Tigra C's advice and ordered the spicy cha cha; it was delicious, and that fact that it was made of yam protein was a plus for me as I try to avoid wheat-based vegetable proteins such as seitan. I asked for onion rings instead of fries as a side and those were very good as well: firm, crunchy exterior and the onion interior was tender and not stringy. For dessert I ordered the strawberry cheesecake because I was intrigued ... does a raw vegan 'cheesecake' actually taste good and creamy? I'm happy to report that it definitely does! The staff is very friendly though for this visit the service was slow, probably because we were a relatively sizable dinner group. But the quality and flavors of the food have made me decide that I am definitely coming back to try other dishes, including the amazing guru rice that Tigra let me have a taste of.",

It was so salty none of us could eat it but I talk to the waitress and they brought out some more that was just excellent. Also, the Sweet & Sour \"Pork\" w/ Pineapple had really, really nice flavor but a strange chewy texture. I would order it again because the flavor was good.  We also order the Family Tofu, steamed broccoli, steamed rice, some kind of \"chicken\" and noodles, and wonton soup. Also, we tried the cheesecake and YUM!!!

All were good and it actually creeped me out for a second thinking that it was real meat (well, at least the texture did).  For an entree, I had the New York Veggie Chicken - it was poured onto a hot plate at my table before being served, which produced a sizzle sizzle effect. It was okay - the mock chicken was good, but the dish itself was average.  I ordered the tofu cheesecake for dessert - very tasty!

Today we were adventurous and tried one of their new menu items, the garlic chicken....wow...it was awesome!  I think it just replaced the lemon grass chicken on my favorites list!  We also checked out their chow mein so we could have some veggies and it was very good as well....a great combo.  They have recently changed the names of their menu items, which I think might be confusing to people because some of the names don't have anything to do with what the actual dish is!  But don't be afraid to ask, the staff is very friendly and they won't be afraid to recommend a dish to you.

It took us nearly 5-10 minutes of looking over each item before doing our best to select just 2-3 items. If possible, we would have ordered everything. And all this knowing that nothing is cooked with diary, meat or eggs! No changes to any dishes, just pick and relax-or rather anticipate how good it will taste.   Ended up getting the Tamari tea-good but mild and the chai tea-delicious! Best ever had out in town.   curry soup-somehow this was served at the perfect temperature. It was delicious.   and the curry rice-very good.   Service was excellent, very homely, nice and polite.   Bathrooms were extremely tidy.   Food did take several extra minutes compared to average restaurant, but that is due to everything being made from scratch. If you want fast food, go to McDonald's. If you want quality, go to this place!",

My carnivore friend invited me out for birthday lunch and let me choose the spot sooo I decided to try the new Indian School location. She was a bit hesitant, but it was my birthday so she agreed.  The interior cracked my up a bit, it looked like what a dining hall in a state institution in NJ in the 80's might have looked like. New but outdated furniture and LOTS of white. Our waitress was really sweet and helpful and especially patient with my friend who looked like a dear in headlights looking over the menu.  We settled on spring rolls, veggie moo shu and the guru fried rice. The spring rolls were small, but perfect appetizer size. I hate when appetizers are so big that I am too full for the main course. They were good, but nothing extraordinary. I really enjoyed the moo shu veggies, we each at two. Then the soup (which came with the entree) tasty lentil and veggie soup. A nice little treat before the man course. We both liked the guru fried rice as well, it had a strong curry taste and was much more flavorful than typical fried rice. We had plenty leftover, which i was sad to see go to waste, but I have a weird aversion to take out or take home food. It grosses me out.  I was really pleasantly surprised with how much my friend really enjoyed the meal, we both got a giggle out of the decor, but would definitely go back.",

Aulac Special Salad was easily the favorite of the table. fresh, flavorful and healthy. the fried rice wasn't bad but nothing special. Summer rolls and pan fried dumplings were good. Sage Lemongrass was too chewy and fried tasting, but not bad. looking forward to trying out the other dishes and supporting a friendly humble establishment!",

All of the flavors were bland and even though he asked for his general tsos to be extra spicy, it didn't make a dent in the scoville scale.  The tea was good and the staff were helpful and quick.  The atmosphere very relaxing.  We really wanted to like this place, but left extremely let down.  Hope your experience is much more satisfying.",

    "text": "Lately I've been quoting Spaceballs a lot with \"Assholes! I'm surrounded by ASSHOLES!\" I think its because of my meal at Loving Hut.  This place has the worst service of anywhere I've ever been, and I've been all over the world.   Just a hint, don't go as a group of more than two people, they are unable to handle anything larger.  We ordered dinner after sitting for about 1/2 hour. Mind you, we were a group of 4 in a room with a total of 9 people. This is not rocket science. I'm borderline retarded and I can still wait tables, and have made a good living doing so. But the attitude we got was \"well, you're lucky I am doing anything for you.\"  Like I said, surrounded by assholes.  But like Onyx said in Slam \"but but but wait, it gets worse!\"  Rule 1 in food service: bring everyone's meal at the table together.  This rule, however, was ignored.  4 people, 40 minutes of waiting for food to finally all come out. My girlfriend's mom and I got our entrees first. Count 40 minutes later, and finally my GF's dad's dinner came out.   Portions were tiny. \"Vegan\" fries were Orieda crinkle fries (I know them anywhere, grew up on them since mom can't cook) and it took all damn night to get our food. I think this was intentional so they could let us sit with their propaganda from Grand Master what's her name for a longer amount of time. It didn't work, now I just hate hippies, vegans and cult members even more.   Solid work on dispelling stereotypes Loving Hut! I won't ever be gracing your little cult compound again.",

The new layout is nice, but I liked the food from before, my sweet and sour faux pork is now labeled \"sweet and sour divine\" and has bell peppers that it never had before. Three strip soup has been taken off the menu completely (they did make it for me though :) I'm hoping it'll be better if I dine in next time, but for now I'm fairly disappointed with the new Loving Hut and left missing the Vege house.",

Try to get them to serve you the new york strip steak because it's unbelievable (this is usually difficult because half the staff doesn't believe it exists! but i swear it does). I've never had much luck with the lemon grass chicken (it usually tastes like cigarette ash!).  The staff is kind of strange but they all seem genuine and caring.   Also, I completely agree with Misty T. when she says don't try the desserts. They taste like glue and spit.",

We went on a Friday night, the space was clean and white if not a bit to stark (adjusting the lighting would work). The food was similar to the other dishes I have had at other Loving Hut locations so at least it was consistent.  The only problem I saw was the service. Everyone seemed to be trying hard and remained friendly while at the same time appearing very scatter brained. We noticed people flagging down waitresses as soon as we sat down so we knew something was aloof. It just seemed to be that they didn't have everything together, like it was opening week or something. Things took awhile and you could see the frantic pace to which everyone was trying to get things done, yet the restaurant was a 1/4 full.  Maybe they will iron out some of they service issues, the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it. I should be thrilled with another vegan restaurant in the valley, but the more I sample vegan cuisine outside of Phoenix the more I crave more of that here.",

    "text": "As a vegan for over 10 years, i hate to NOT support a tried and True vegan restaurant in phoenix. But i have to be honest and say that this place did not live up to my expectations. In fact, it fell quite short. I ate at the Glendale Loving Hut location and had a FAR better experience there, so my review here is only for the Phoenix location. By all means, DO go to the Glendale one! It has a different menu and completely different atmosphere.  The phoenix location on Indian School Road has a very drab interior, and very outdated. White metal chairs that looked like they were from the '80s. My first impression walking in was not a good one, and that is important to me. Definitely not a soothing relaxing atmosphere by any means. Also, there was a bad odor in the air. Almost smelled fishy to me. It almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest.   Ok, now on to the food. I got the Grilled Teryaki dish. By the way, did i mention prices are also higher at this location? $9.00 was the cost of this dish -- for lunch! Prices are a couple dollars less at the Glendale spot. Anyways, the faux meat in this dish was fine -- nothing to write home about, but it was \"good\". However, my complaint is that is ALL it was. Just a big pile of fake meat, and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetables on the side with no sauce or marinades on them. Just plain vegetables, and they were getting colder by the minute. Not really what i had in mind for lunch and certainly not worth the $9.00 plus the tip. I guess i should have gotten the rice to go with it all, but that was extra money!  The complimentary lentil soup was a nice touch, but i've had better lentil soup that i've made myself. The soup too was only lukewarm, and very small cup size portion.  The only positive i can say is that the waitress was wonderful and very friendly. I feel bad writing a bad review, but honesty is my policy.",

The pricing is amazingly cheap (maybe they could add 10 cents to each dish for paint).

I started taking my orders to go, and have been much happier for it. The staff are friendly, if a bit cold. I don't mean to be offensive or impolite, but I find the looping spiritual lectures on the television in the \"bar\" (waiter station) to be off-putting, along with the waiters' intent concentration. I think they might have paintings by her on the walls, too. And a portrait. I hate the 1987 dining sets, and I don't like the plastic table coverings. I wish they served wine, but I guess it's probably against their beliefs, so I feel weird about complaining.   The food is so good, though. I love the stuffed tomatoes, nice texture, and the hot and sour soup is both hot and sour. Sizzling rice soup is also quite good. If you eat in, they deliver the fried rice and you can put it in and hear it sizzle. The tea they serve in the dining room is also missed by taking my food to go. The lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork are my favorite entrees, but I also like the duck and eel selections. The shrimp are so realistic, if not a spot on imitation. I do not particularly care for the juices they serve, but no entree has been unsatisfactory in the years I've been going in.   I just wish they delivered and had better hours, but I guess it isn't their thing.",

It was the perfect amount of spicy, full of veggies, and filled me up just fine. My friend had the pho and as a new vegan, was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. On top of it all, we got our food super fast which was great because of how hangry the both of us were getting  So why the three stars instead of five? Our waitress.   She wasn't wearing a name tag and she never introduced herself, but she has shorter brown/black hair parted off to the side. She was attentive but holy crap, was she rude. Barely spoke a word to us, was pretty blunt when she did, and overall lacks customer service (or maybe social skills in general). She never checked in on us to see how we were doing or how everything tasted. Before we were even halfway done with our meal, she comes over to ask, \"Are you guys going to need anything else?\" Sorry? Way to make your guests feel like an inconvenience. Each time we said thank you, all we got was silence in return. My third graders have better manners and are far more polite.   Not a very personable person by any means, and because of it I just might have to go to a different Loving Hut location.",

How does a place like this make vegan food so unhealthy?! Every item was just drenched in oil and fried... I could have gotten food like this from Panda Express or worse.  We ordered the sweet and sour \"chicken\", pad thai, and spring rolls based off of Yelp recommendations. They completely forgot our rice (even though they asked us white or brown on the phone) for the sweet and sour \"chicken\" so it was basically fried balls of batter in an overly sweet orange sauce. The pad thai had formed itself into one giant ball of noodles and yet still was drenched in oil. The spring rolls were so greasy they left oil on your lips. We actually both got SICK from the food here. We threw away the rest of the leftovers and vowed to never go back....  If you are looking to try great vegan food, try Green New American Vegetarian. Loving Hut is definitely not a good representation of how tasty vegetarian food can be. Don't waste your money!",

Come to Loving Hut and you'll find out more and more famous people are vegan...even politicians.  The Supreme Master Ching Hai might be upset with my review....but here goes...  The menu was very nice and colorful.  My coworker ordered the appetizers, Golden Rolls and Heaven Rice Rolls.  The Golden Rolls has this tofu stench to it, maybe it was the oil they used to deep fried it in but I had to cover the taste with a lot of sweet and sour sauce.  The Heaven Rice Rolls however, was very good, I didn't expect to like it, but I really really did.  The peatnut sauce dip complement the rolls very well.  For the main course I had Au Lac noodle which is a fancy name they gave for vegan Pho.  It was soooo soooo bad, I can not imagine how someone can swallow this. The broth was very bland and the \"meat\" has a stench to it.  I brought it home (without the broth) and let my sister- who is a seasonal vegan, tried it and she did not like it one bit.   If yelp let me give it a half star I would for the logo.   I must say, the logo of the restaurant......is cute.",

The service was pretty decent. She came to our table often. The citrus infused water and the hot tea were terrific!   We ordered some spring rolls and wontons to start. They were both ok.   I ordered the Hawaiian burger and it was beyond messy, also they put the worlds smallest piece of pineapple on it and it didn't taste fresh at all.   Hubs order the Philly steak sandwich and our friend got the spicy cha cha, both said they liked it.   We will probably go back again and try some different dishes.

Was totally amazed that soy protein cooked properly can be just as good,  if not more tasty than meat. If I could eat like this every day I would be a vegetarian; no BFD!  The Food at Loving Hut is delicious, the atmosphere intriguing; WTF is the supreme master? She's this righteous chick that loves baby animals and thinks vegan lifestyle rocks, and that you should drive a hybrid.  Call it a cult, then call Mormonism a cult...oh you do?  Well it's not that culty, and it's more personality than anything, along with great healthy food!",

They might consider doing some kind of HGTV make-over show... it is seriously that bland.  On the other hand, the service was super sweet and friendly.  The waitress walked us through the menu (our first time there), chatted with our 4-year-old, and even brought him out a free apple juice... just to be nice :)  She even praised us for raising our son as a vegan... we didn't have the heart to tell her that he eats meat - and so do I!  I was a little weirded out when I saw the menu and EVERYTHING looked like meat.  When I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, it just seems strange to make it look like a cow.  Even though it wasn't what I had expected, it was still really delicious.  We had the spicy \"shrimp\", \"beef\" and broccoli, crispy wontons, and the \"hamburger\".  Everything was great, and I doubt most meat-eaters could even tell that these were vegan items.    We're looking forward to a return visit... and perhaps take-out on April Fool's Day, to trick my carnivore father into eating something \"veggie\" ;)",

Also my new favorite is the Wonton Soup, it's perfectly satisfying!",

I don't eat meat and I hadn't really found any vegetarian restaurant that did fake meat well, until I went to The Loving Hut.  It seems like every time we go there our eyes widen and we're asking, \"how the hell did they do that?\"  Last night, they made yams taste like shrimp--not just taste like it, but have the same texture. WTF!?  Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green, (I'm biased toward American-style food anyway), its food is unique, tasty, and inexpensive.

Vegans should be enamored by Loving Hut (I'm not vegan, but occasionally enjoy a vegan meal). The menu is as vast and diverse as a Chinese vegan menu can be. The \"proteins,\" a.k.a. soy chicken, soy beef, and soy shrimp, should win oscars for best actor. Their consistencies and flavorings were great. I started with the fresh garden rolls and had a the New York stir-fry chicken entree. Both were fantastic.  The service was also a highlight -- our server took the time to explain the entire menu, and even offered her own recommendations based on our preferences.  It's a family-owned place, and I was proud to support them. Even though there was a TV streaming vegan propaganda in six languages, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and highly recommend this place.",

They did offer us a complimentary lentil soup, which was delicious. The water was lemon-and-lime-infused, and the tea was surprisingly strong for the delicate color.   I ordered the \"Spicy Cha Cha\" (Yam-based protein, red & green bell peppers, green onions, celery, spicy seasoning, lettuce; $7.95). I had no idea what Cha Cha was, or what yam-based protien is, but what I was served looked and tasted exactly like fried shrimp. It was salty and I'm sure it was a few more grams of fat than I'd prefer, but my, it was delicious.  My husband had the Hawaiian Burger (Soy patty, vegan butter, pineapple, teriyaki sauce, mushroom, lettuce, tomato, vegenaise, French fries; $7.95)He said he'd definitely like to come back.  I'll echo what others have said about the stark white decor and the flat-screen monitors with the propaganda, although I didn't really see anything offensive. The annoyance factor just increased because of the long time we had to wait for our entrees.",

ThanksLiving at Loving Hut was the exact place that offered us all of the above. I had signed up for a meetup that was going to be meeting and dining at Loving Hut with an all Vegan experience.   For starters, we had the butternut squash soup with a side salad with a not too sweet onion dressing. Both were delicious.   Next the main course consisted of a glazed vegan roast, cranberry- walnut herbed stuffing, rosemary-garlic mashed potatoes with mushrooms & sage gravy, fried Brussels sprouts, sweet corn, sweet potatoes, and caramelized sliced apples. All this wonderful goodness got washed down with sparkling apple cider.   For dessert we had vegan chocolate ice cream with chocolate cake. Extra bonus points!   Wow, I was stuffed about half way through the meal. But the good kind of stuffed, not the kind that makes you not want to move off the couch.   We loved every bit of the food and dessert, we even made new friends and found another vegan restaurant that does it right so you leave wanting more! We will be back to taste the items off of the extensive regular menu. There were several items which caught my eye. We will be back sooner than later!",

I checked out the menu online in advance so I could see what dishes they have and what I'd want to order. I appreciate that they accompany their list of items with pictures, it helped a lot. I zoned in on the BBQ noodles plate that comes with golden spring rolls cut on top and it was a great choice. The only thing I didn't like was the pickled topping of carrots and daikon but everything else was tasty. The fake beef (veg protein) was seasoned well and the rolls were crunchy and flavorful. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their picks and I got to try the spicy cha cha and the guru rice (DEFINITELY getting this next time!).   1 star off because our food took a long time, although mine somehow came out before everyone else's but after the appetizers. I'd come back for sure! They've got three other locations, one of which is in Tempe.",

    "text": "I've ate from this International chain so many times. I live in Tempe, so I frequent that location. My friend lives near this one, and wanted to try some vegan food so we went here. It started out okay, our waitress had impeccable service the whole time. We ordered the fried won-tons and they were great, and so was the specialty orange drink we got (can't remember the name). She got a dish that was the one I always get at the Tempe location but it had a different name, and I ordered something I'd never gotten, the New Yorker. Our food took a little while but nothing crazy. She liked her dish, which I tried and it was not nearly as good as the Tempe one. Really bland. My food was awful. It tasted like undercooked cat food. I was like, oh man this sucks. I've never had a dish from this chain I didn't like. So I politely asked our waitress if she'd mind taking it back to the kitchen and removing it from our bill, since I only tried a single bite and the rest was untouched because it was nasty. She seemed hesitant, but was really kind and said she'd talk to the manager. The manager comes out and is literally arguing that we have to pay for it because they made it and she didn't care that I didn't like it or eat it. That I should take it home. Why would I take it home? To throw it away there? She literally interrupts my friend and I trying to nicely explain it just wasn't good and we didn't think it would be fair to pay since we didn't eat it, it tasted terrible! On top of interrupting us, she scoffs, and just walks away. We are sitting there like what the hell.. she comes back and literally throws the check onto the table knocking off a fork. She removed it from the bill. This whole thing was insane. I've never had a dish from here i didn't like until that moment, and the rest of the food was great. The waitress had to apologize for her, and let us know that she keeps all the tips that are made unless its cash on the table. if you're going to eat loving hut, eat at literally any other location.",

I was pleasantly surprised with all the yummy choices they had on their menu that would make any meat lover believe it's possible to live a long, healthy life of veganism;) Most of their food is Asian influenced, although they have some western favorites too- including burgers:). I ordered the spring rolls, Lemongrass (vegan chicken) Delight (A must try!), broccoli and mushroom dish, and Mongolian (vegan beef) Delight (SO GOOD!), and Fried Rice. The food was so delicious! You seriously can't tell the difference between real meat and vegan \"meat\". Go try it for yourself and see. No need to kill animals anymore to get the same tastes and foods we love.  - Still thinking about it and how good it was! - Especially the lemongrass and mongollian  delight. The sauces were soooo good!        The place was spic and span clean and the service was great too. Best part was when they brought us ketchup and mustard bottles with our food though- I was like \"what the..??\" - as we had ordered Asian food. Apparently they use those old school diner bottles to put in Asian sauces- haha! Confusing, but it works;) ... All in all it was great and I will definitely be back very, very soon!  FYI: Beware, they have funky hours and holidays so make sure they're open before you head over.",

In that time we saw people come in and be seated not by the staff, but by people waiting to pick up to go orders. This is simply unacceptable.   The food is just okay. The flavor mostly comes from the sauces they use, not from the actual food.  So they can use the same protein sources in multiple dishes and just put a new sauce on it. The drinks however are pretty delish, but clearly not a reason to go out of your way or put up with terrible service.   There are better choices for vegetarian food in the valley, and I would highly recommend going to one of them.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place out on a Sunday night around 6:30. The restaurant was kind of busy but the two servers working should have been able to handle it. We stood at the host stand about 5 minutes before the cook told us to sit anywhere and handed us menus.   It took over 30 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. We put our order in because we were obviously ready( drinks, an appetizer, and entree's). The sever never came back while we were waiting for the food. However, all the food came out at a reasonable time for being down a cook (about 40 minutes). At this time we asked about our drink and the other server who brought the food said they were in process.   Half way through the food we finally got the drinks. So what about an hour and a half though the total time sitting down.   Now the food.   We got the heaven rolls of something and they didn't have much flavor. It came with a peanut sauce and the tofu in the rolls were breaded in peanuts. So just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors.   Boyfriend got the western burger with vegetables. The burger looked store bought and the sauce tasted store bought. The vegetables were steamed but did not have any flavor or seasoning on it at all.   I got the steak and potatoes. Steak was store bought and the potatoes were simple like morning potatoes with peppers and onions. Anyone could make it.   I've been a vegetarian for over six years and this is the worst place I have ever been. I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review. Now that I actually have an account I will review more places. Usually I amforgiving when it comes to local places but I will never eat here again.",

Come a half hour before you get too hungry, and  bring a book, a kindle, or something to occupy your time--like maybe a friend to talk to?   My friend had the Hawaiian Burger and raved about it for two days.  I had the Pad Thai and am currently fantasizing about it.  We wanted the Red Velvet cake since it looked amazing, but it sold out before I could get my hands on a slice.  Never mind, we tried the banana cake with coconut icing.  That was pretty fantastic, but had more crumbly texture than a cake-it was more muffin-ey maybe.  Still freaking great though!",

    "text": "Definitely try the Western burger!! Much better burger than even the Big Wac at Green...I know that's practically vegan sacrilege, but it's True! The Western is a bbq'd gardein patty topped with pineapple, fried onion rings, lettuce and mayo. Yum!  Our other favorite dish here is the Rainbow Salad. Like a vinegar slaw, but sweet and with peanuts and a veg meaty protein that tastes similar to ham imo. Delicious!  The fried shrimp, actually fried yam protein, is so amazing too...perfect texture and taste.  The milkshakes are very rich and either soy milk based or coconut milk based depending on the flavor. They have cakes and pies for dessert too but my favorite is a slice of the raw vegan cheesecake!",

I waited 40 min for a take out (with only 2 occupied tables at that time) 2. A guy who ordered after me got a free piece of cake for the long wait. (it wasn't offered to me)  3. Terrible service  4. The decor is something you see in senior houses in Sun City 5. Almost all items on the menu have soy protein.. TVP? Is it really something healthy or it's some sort of cardboard pretending to be food? 6. They packed my to go order in such a way that the soup turned before I got to my car, soaking thru the paper bag, landing on my pants, and on the sidewalk...  I went inside to tell them that- NO apology, NO money back.   I wonder why they are not closed yet.",

I wanted to walk out but stayed because I was so hungry and haven't eaten all day.  I ordered a dish and drink, dish came out unappetizing and wrong while the drink never got made. The server dropped off my food and never gave me utensils. No one was around and I had to wait for 10 minutes until she came around and asked me about the food and I told her she never gave me anything to eat with.  The protein was too salty and I still was very unhappy and the server took my water away. It took forever to get their attention to get me another water. They even took forever to bring me back change and this is when the restaurant is empty. Bill was $10.29 and I paid 20.35. They even have issues with simple math asking me what I gave them. They gave me back dollar bills as if I should tip them. I fucking hate this place and the incompetent people who run it.  I should have walked away without paying. The airheads ruined my one Sunday off I got in over month. I work in a restaurant and I know when service is completely shitty. This place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",

    "text": "We love this place! This is gonna be a long review, so read on if you dare :-) My hubby and I are vegan due to health reasons for over four years now, but very rarely eat out, no vegan restaurants near our home, plus we have usually been disappointed by the food or service when we have tried eating out in the past, so we gave up trying. While in Phoenix two weeks ago (28 mile drive from where we live) we found this Loving Hut on Indian School Rd and decided to give vegan eating out one more go...Thankfully we arrived in time for the lunch menu, as they close at 2:30 pm and reopen at 5:00 pm. We were greeted by smiling faces and sat where we wanted in the open seating area. We were tickled to see all the options on the menu, especially heavy on the veggies and Vietnamese leaning, as i think the owners are two Vietnamese ladies, who are there in the forefront greeting and serving. We found all of the people there to be friendly and gracious. The young lady that took our order was very knowledgeable of the menu, helping us choose items, and explained that everything would be brought out as it is ready, whereas an entree may arrive before an appetizer.  We were fine with that and happily ordered away.  Appetizers we chose were the Summer Rolls and Mu Shu Vegetables...for main courses we ordered the Wonton Soup and the Loving Hut burger...wanting extra veggies we also ordered the Veggie Delight entree. We were enjoying the atmosphere and the pleasant staff so much that we didn't even notice how long it took to start receiving our food, but it was not too long and the feasting began! Everything looked beautiful and tasted fantastic!  We thoroughly enjoyed every bite and savored the flavor and obvious care and thoughtfulness in preparation by the cooks. Maybe we appreciated it more because we rarely eat meals away from home, but we were in vegan heaven! :-)  The servers were attentive and laid back, taking time to chat with us, which we appreciated. Some reviews on here are so negative, that is a shame, we had a totally happy experience, and no leftovers, we devoured everything! We loved it so much so that we drove 35 minutes again yesterday and returned with my Hubby's 81 year old carnivorous Mom, and she loved everything as well. We ordered almost all the same food as last week, but got the Heaven Rice Rolls instead of Mu Shu Vegetables, and TWO orders of Summer Rolls (delish!) plus Sizzling Rice Soup in addition to Wonton, and the  Love of Family entree. I asked for water sauteing for the Love of Family veggies as well as the tofu instead of oil, and the lovely server Diana (pronounced \"Dee-onna\") happily saw to it that that is what I got...Yum, yum! Also, my hubby subbed steamed veggies for the fries this time (with my more healthy minded nagging) with his Loving Hut Burger, while Mom went for the fries with her L.H burger. It was awesome seeing our mom happily eating plant based food and not missing the meat and dairy she so dearly loves...maybe we can convert her to our side with enough Saturday excursions to Phoenix! Ok, we won't be coming every week, but we now know we have a place where we can thoroughly enjoy delicious,  plant based food prepared and served with thoughtfulness, graciousness and deliciousness :-) infusing flavor in every bite...oh, and did I mention very reasonably priced too? We had all that food, plenty for three people, plus hot tea and coffee for only 67 dollars...plus we left what we hope was a generous tip...and took leftovers this time too! We would have happily paid more, but of course we are older and eating out is a rare event, so we splurged! Thank you everyone at Loving Hut Phoenix, see you next month!",

There was so much food I had lunch the following day. Hostess/waitress was extremely polite, friendly and helpful. While waiting for our orders she checked back with us frequently. As for my son (the meat eater) he really enjoyed the food as well. Great job \"Loving Hut\"!",

However Loving Hut was more than accommodating for my abnormal soy aversion and informed me they had Yam protein, which I ordered and gladly devoured.  The yam protein mimicked or at least looked like shrimp.  The Pad Thai tasted as I expected Pad Thai would taste in any restaurant.   The clientele there seem to be abnormally friend and conversation tend to move toward how everyone became vegan, which seems to be brought on first by a bout of bad health issues.  It is a bit odd to overhear so many conversations on the same subject matter, which are almost like small testimonials for the vegan concept.    I say to eat and know you can live without animal protein....!",

I seriously have NO idea how anyone could eat such a salty dish alone!!! I have never seen any Asian restaurant that charges their customer for rice (extra ones maybe), even western style Asian fusion places. But they do and not a sign on their menu. This is ridiculous. Just a heads up for anyone wanna eat there. And for the restaurant, if you really want to get more money raise the price of your food. This feels like cheating.

    "text": "I'll start by saying the food is delicious and their hearts are in the right place.   But there was so much wrong with our visit, I can't justifiably rate them higher than a 2, as much as it pains me to give a vegan restaurant a low rating.   Firstly, we waited 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us at the front door. After we were seated, we waited 30 minutes before our order was taken. 20 minutes later we were told they were out of rice for our dinners. No rice. Let that sink in for a moment.   After selecting our rice substitutions, my dish came out ahead of all the others; looking great, but my husband and children were still without food, so I waited to eat, assuming theirs would be along quickly.  My husband's dish came out TEN minutes later.  My children still were waiting and my dish was rapidly cooling.  The children's dishes came out five minutes later. 15 minutes after mine.  Our wonton soup appetizer never arrived at all.    Once we were all able to eat, unfortunately nothing was particularly hot,  though the flavors were all delicious.   They comped our hot tea, but it arrived midway through the meal.    I had to ask for soy sauce and chopsticks as they weren't on the table.   The manager, while pleasant and friendly, let us know the reason for the delay was that the dishes all cook at different rates and they don't have heat lamps.   That may be a truthful excuse, however, if that's the choice they are going to make as a restaurant, they need to manage the kitchen better and start cooking the more complicated/lengthily dishes first so everything comes out at once. Serving one dish to a table of 4 while everyone else sits and waits for 15 minutes isn't acceptable. As for the rice, I can't think of a reason for being out of rice. It's a staple in the kitchen. And with 45 minutes prep time (plus another 30 before taking orders), a batch of rice easily could have been prepared.   Finally, there was a couple seated with a dog in a dog bed under the table (not a service dog), which is disgusting, and a doorbell that sounded throughout the dining room every time someone arrived or left; it was a jarring and unpleasant addition to the atmosphere.   I'm sure as a take out restaurant, they'd do well, but as a sit down restaurant, they made far too many mistakes to have a 4-star rating on Yelp.",

    "text": "I'll have to admit. When I hear the words \"Loving Hut,\" I think of perhaps some primitive version of the song \"Love Shack\":   ** If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says 15 miles to the, Loving Hut! Loving Hut yeah I'm headin' down the Phoenix highway, lookin' for the vegan getaway Heading for the vegan getaway, vegan getaway, I got me a car, it's as big as a whale and we're headin' on down To the Loving Hut... **  The song coursed through my head a few times as I ventured in and browsed through the menu (**Loving Hut baby! Loving Hut bay-bee...**). I was on a limited time schedule so I got the lemongrass chicken ($9.50) and a slice of carrot cake ($4.50) to go. Although prices seemed a bit high and that I could get lemongrass chicken made with real chicken for cheaper somewhere else, I was hopeful for a good quality meal. It took maybe 10-15 minutes for it to be made and packaged, and the cake was already prepackaged in their dessert counter. The packaging itself is paper-based and thus eco-friendly, as are their to-go bags.   The lemongrass chicken was a generous portion of soy chunks, deep-fried, and then covered in a pungent lemongrass mixture. The texture of the \"chicken\" was kind of like a mix between fish and chicken, and was tender on the inside. The pieces were nicely seasoned and had a nice outer crunch from the deep-frying. The \"chicken\" nuggets were placed on a bed of romaine, with a slice of carrot and cucumber. As for the carrot cake, it was also a generous serving, filled with freshly grated carrot and large chunks of nuts. I loved the light, whipped topping. The ingredients themselves were great, however, it did taste slightly dry to me.  One thing to note, is that rice is not automatically included with the entrees, and will cost you $1.   Off to the side of the cash register, there's a small section of vegetarian goods, such as fake beef and chicken. They even sell a vegan dog food!  So, even if you're an omnivore, it's a good place to get a flavorful meal. I doubt you will miss the meat! And remember,  **The Loving Hut is a little old place where we can get together Loving Hut baby, Loving Hut bay-bee!**",
