For dinner, I ordered Kung Pao as my entree and Cucumber Rolls for an appetizer. First, the Cucumber Rolls were insane!  I could have eaten another order or two!  Kung Pao is their most popular dish and I can see why. Loved all the super fresh vegetables. I love this place!",

Despite reading many negative reviews about the service, I indeed experienced a waiting time for food that was inexcusable. We were the ONLY 2 people in the restaurant and it took almost 2 hours to get drinks,order, and receive food. The food itsself was about what you'd expect for asian vegetarian, but if I ever came back I would order takeout.   Their \"patio\" is basically in a parking lot facing a strip mall. Not a good ambiance at all, and the decor is tastelessly outdated and drab.",

Servings were quite healthy (for a hearty eater like me), the Green Papaya was everything people said it would be and more.  Fresh and invigorating.   On my second visit I had the curry. And this is what I liked so much about it: a fine combination of strong flavors that was not overwhelming. You can really taste the different herbs and spices that are in the plate, instead of just bland watered down curry. Very nice!   And the lemongrass noodle soup... I think I have found a new comfort food!  The good news was that this place was very close to my hotel and made my stay that much more enjoyable. The bad news is that I am going to have a hard time finding the exact same tastes back home, and I will have to come back for some more (or learn the damn recipes!)",

    "text": "I'm in love with Fresh Mint!   This place is amazing.   And I'm NOT a vegetarian!!    We had a gift certificate so we went all out and tried lots of different options on our first visit.  I'll give you the scoop, but for a quick snapshot -here's the deal:  -super affordable, meals between $5-10. -generous portions -delicious & flavorful foods (Kung Pao!)  -friendly staff -casual environment   First up:  Fresh summer rolls and Green Papaya salad.    The spring rolls were beautiful. Wow!  They had a little more lettuce than I personally prefer, but the taste was still great.  The papaya salad was delicious.  It was not spicy at all, and I will probably ask for a little more spice or peanut sauce on the side next time, but it was so flavorful it still hit the spot.  Two of us shared this dish and I still took home enough for another meal the next day - definitely good for sharing.    Next course: Pho / Five Spice Noodle Soup. This dish amazed me.  A little sweet, so savory and rich flavored.  Tasted like homemade beef pho.  My family has Pho for Christmas each year - this definitely could be in the running for my favorite Pho!   Entrees:   Upon recommendations from our server, we chose the Pad Thai & the Kung Pao dishes.   Both were generous portions and bursting with flavor.  They are also just beautifully plated.  I like my Pad Thai with a little more kick, so would request that next time around.   The Kung Pao was PERFECT!  I highly, highly recommend this dish.   Dessert:  Well, as if we hadn't had enough yet - we let ourselves get talked into the chocolate cake.   Oh my!  It was a delicacy!   This massive slice of chocolatey goodness was a 4 or 5 layer cake with a fruity filling (strawberry or raspberry?), a creme layer, another chocolate creme layer and a fabulous icing.  It was quite decadent.    Vietnamese iced coffee and lemonade were also enjoyed!     We took home 4 to go boxes (papaya salad, pad thai, kung pao, and chocolate cake!), so the portions are definitely generous.  The food was not heavy so we left feeling satisfied.   The staff were friendly and attentive. The prices were so affordable, this is definitely a place that can be a regular go-to spot!   LOVE this place!",

They offer gf vegan which is why i had them bookmarked .I called in an order from my car and told them i could be there in half an hour to pick it up .( it was ready upon arrival)  Sweet and Sour soup was very decent from the GF menu ,The Lotus salad was amazing, super fresh,  and i loved the Vinaigrette (it was lightly citrus ) the cucumbers in this salad were so awesome because of how fresh and crisp they were .The whole salad was great, however, the cucumbers were dynamite. I also had cucumber rolls that were tasty and nicely done.  My $22 dinner for one was worth every penny - i loved how fresh everything tasted. Friendly service on phone and at pick-up .

We got there around 12:15 yesterday and grabbed the last remaining table. We were greeted promptly and had our order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated. I ordered the fried spring veggie rolls ($6) that were delicious. I kept snacking off the fried crispy pieces of the sides.   For lunch, I had ordered the curry tofu and potatoes ($8). It came with carrots mixed in the curry sauce with rice and salad. I equally enjoyed the salad and curry sauce over the rice. I didn't care for the spongy tofu and would have liked more vegetables in the curry rather than just potatoes and carrots. This lunch was just okay.   The service was horrible. I didn't get my lunch until 12:50 p.m. The owner was aware of it and apologized but apologies don't prevent me from getting back to work on time. When we were ready to pay, it took forever for him to pick up the check. My friend had to flag him down to get his attention. Very irritating. Timely service in a restaurant is important to me. I would have average food and phenomenal service, as opposed to, phenomal food and terrible service.   Overall, the food was decent/mediocre at times with terrible service. It's doubtful I would go back.",

    "text": "We found Fresh Mint while searching for vegetarian dining options in Scottsdale. It was a bit of a drive from where we were staying down on N. McDowell Road, but totally worth it!  The restaurant is a smallish (but very bright and cheerful) storefront operation in a large shopping complex a few miles north of downtown Scottsdale. The first thing that hits you, as you walk in, is \"wow...something smells fantastic!\" (always a good way to start a relationship with a restaurant!). Jasmine rice and ginger...one of my favorite combinations!  We chose to sit inside (there is what appears to be a good-sized patio seating area as well). I was very impressed by the decor, which was very bright, clean, and modern...despite the size and the location, it doesn't have the look or feel of a fast-food joint. Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  It's always a bit overwhelming for us when we can eat anything on the menu without having to ask \"does this have meat in it?\" or \"is this cooked with fish sauce?\" so it took us a few minutes to decide what to have. We finally settled on an order of the fried imperial rolls to share. For our entrees, I went with the Golden Soy Chicken Delight (the words \"ginger sauce\" get me every time!) and my husband chose the Signature Lemongrass Curry (with the Japanese eggplant option rather than tofu). We were both pleased that they offer brown rice as an option (we'll eat white rice, but prefer brown).  Everything is prepared fresh to order there, so we'd expected service to be a bit slow, and were pleasantly surprised at how quickly our appetizer came out. The imperial rolls were absolutely delicious! The texture of the taro-based filling was perfect, and the slight sweetness was nicely off-set by the tasty, vinegary, sauce that was served alongside. A single order was perfect for two.  Our entrees came out shortly after we'd finished the imperial rolls, and it was love at first bite! I had planned to ask them if they make their own meat analogs and forgot, which is too bad, because the texture was unique and very pleasant (often meat analogs can have an unpleasantly chewy texture, but my \"chicken\" was nicely tender). The sauces were wonderful! Mine had a nice, gingery edge, and my husband's curry was deliciously complex, with a lovely lemony taste from the lemongrass.  Presentation was very attractive. If I have to nitpick, the one thing I would change is the ordering of the food on the plate. Both our entrees had the rice and the saucy, meaty stuff separated by a large \"dam\" of lightly steamed vegetables, which made it difficult to combine the entree with the rice. The veggies were tasty and well-prepared, but there were too many of them and they were cut too large to make them easy to incorporate into the dish. I would suggest cutting them more finely and serving them on one side of the plate rather than between the rice and the \"meat.\" It's a very minor point, though.  The restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, so we both had tea with our meals. Soft drinks were also available.  One interesting thing, that some diners may want to know about...the restaurant is certified kosher! I overheard the owner speaking with a Jewish couple at a nearby table and evidently when they opened in the area, an early patron strongly advised them to get kosher certification, as there is a large Jewish community in that part of Scottsdale. It's nice to see a restaurant that is truly sensitive to the needs of the community in which it finds itself.  All in all, a very pleasant dining experience!",

    "text": "Three of us went to Fresh Mint today for lunch.  We did not like it.  We started with an order of Summer Rolls.  Yuck, they were a piece of tofu and shredded cabbage rolled in rice paper, served with a thick, unappealing peanut sauce studded with raw peanuts. Presentation was nice, but it did not taste like anything except cabbage wrapped in rice paper.  My companions each ordered Pad Thai and I had the Five Spice Pho.  The Pad Thai arrived first. I looked at it and was very happy I did not order it.  It looked like a plate of gummy sauce-covered glop.  Tasted as bad as it looked. My Five Spice Pho looked delicious, but did not have any flavor.  Adding the hot sauce that is served on the side, only added heat, but no flavor.  The broth tasted like water.  We did like the Mint Lemonade, but at $3.95 a glass, it was pretty pricey.  Our lunch bill came to $44.  Very expensive for what we were served.  Needless to say, I am crossing Fresh Mint off my list.  No reason to go back.  I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the Yelpers that think it is so great, but actually, I would rather give it one.  Vegetarian does not have to be bland and tasteless.",

    "text": "Let me start out by simply stating: the food here is incredible. Completely unique and delicious. They do have things you have heard of before, of course (Kung Pao SOY chicken and Golden Curry Vegetables) but I'm a regular here and have tried many dishes and I can safely say it is done in a way that has never been done before. This place is a far jump from fast food. If you are looking for typical, greasy, mediocre Chinese food, you won't find it here; nor will you find a run-of-the-mill salad bar. As corny as it sounds...Fresh Mint lives up to its name: everything tastes fresh! The dishes are extremely flavorful as well as a work of art. Everything is very pretty and thoughtfully laid out. You can tell the owners and employees put care into their food display--this is a family owned restaurant so from what I've seen, they certainly put pride into their work.  Your experience is not over once you leave. The feeling afterward is another experience in itself. I have never felt heavy or unhealthy OR guilty after eating here! I feel light and nourished.  I highly recommend this place to anybody, especially if you're looking for something new, special and unique. It's very green (the walls' colors make you want a fresh salad, I think they did it on purpose), the owners are friendly and most of all, the food is SOOOO amazing. After writing this review, I find myself craving some more of their food!  *OH and another thing: you CAN make reservations, that thing up there is wrong saying you can't (I've brought in many parties before).*",

I've had \"vegetarian\" pho at another restaurant that the broth was bland and it was so overloaded with veggies it was distracting. They kept it simple with a sweet yet savory broth, veg meat (which was actually really good to my surprise), and even a vegan fish sauce. The owner (husband) was SO nice and even told me how to assemble my soup (which I already knew since I've had traditional pho many many times). The best thing is that everything on the menu is vegan (except for #31, which has egg noodles). I'm excited to go back and try some of the chef specials, they sound fantastic!",

It sort of felt like things were just thrown together. Anybody else notice the bad chi? I still decided to order food, but takeout instead of dining in because of the vibe. I went with the kung pao chicken. I can absolutely imagine some vegans/vegetarians not being able to stomach the texture of the faux meat here. I can only imagine all of the processing they do to turn the soy into what they serve. I don't know what kind of pact they made with the meat gods, but they have the texture and look down to a science. Literally. It made me wonder what kind of graduated cylinders, Bunsen burners and potions they have in the back, with some evil scientist, er, I mean chef at the helm. The array of vegetables in my entree looked and tasted fresh and the sauce was good and added with a light hand, which I appreciate. The portions were great, but NOT for the price. My meal was $13! No drink, no salad, no dessert. Er... Do you know how many burrito bowls that is?! Just saying...  All in all, I would go back, but I would steer away from the faux meat and focus on the salads (and the prices!).",

You couldn't even tell the meat was imitation meat. The flavor was great and everything was made to order.  We had a big group so he put in a little bit of the orders at a time since they were freshly made.   I would highly recommend this place and will be back.",

    "text": "This restaurant is such a refreshing discovery in North Scottsdale!  The food is incredible, it is definitely my new favorite vegan restaurant and I have frequented many in the Phoenix area including Green, The Loving Hut, and others.  This is definitely my favorite for several reasons.  First, the chef is amazing (it is the owner) and her husband actually served us our food.  They are from Hawaii and the restaurant itself is a warm, friendly, welcoming environment for everyone.  The food was high quality for more than reasonable prices and was very filling.  I eat ALOT so that was imporatant to me as I sometimes leave vegan restaurants still hungry. I would also feel very comfortable taking all of my carnivore friends to this restaurant as I believe they would be unable to tell the difference between the delicious vegan protien (faux meat) and the real thing.  In fact, I believe we will be hosting our carnivore friends for Thanksgiving and offering prepared food from this restaurant as an option at dinner- it is that tasty! The chef's husband personally delivered our food, was very friendly and initiated very nice conversation with my partner and I.  We truly felt welcomed and will be returning weekly unless something can beat this!  It should be noted that I have very little time on here to write reviews and specifically joined this site because I felt so strongly about promoting this restaurant through an online review that I created an account!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!",

It can be hard being vegetarian and having the option to eat anything but veggie sandwiches and burgers, pasta or pizza when going out.

The food was good, but we were the only ones there, so it was quiet, and this was at noon.    They need to either lower their prices to attract more lunch crowd, or move to a bigger place and offer an upscale diner.  Right now, I'm not sure they know their identity, and customers don't like to experiment either.  Get it figured out, or you will be gone in a few months, which would be a shame.",

The \"strip mall\" references made by other reviewers are accurate.   Service was S.L.O.W. until the man, who I think owns the restaurant, showed up to save the day. Still, it took a long time to get our food.   We shared the summer rolls, which I think were below average. The wrappers were a bit mushy and I found the rolls to lack flavor. We also got some fried rolls (can't remember the name, but they had yucca root in them... Imperial Rolls maybe?) and they were pretty tasty.   I ordered the Spicy Lemongrass Tofu lunch special. The salad was average \"bag\" salad, but I liked the dressing - flavorful with a kick. The tofu was yummy - in a curry coconut milk sauce - but it was ONLY tofu. I actually love tofu, but I was hoping for a few veggies. I would not order this again w/o requesting they add some broccoli or something. Just too rich of a dish for my taste. My brother got the kung pao chicken which looked Delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was pretty good.   This place was definitely expensive. I was surprised, visiting from the Bay Area, that prices at this place, which resembles a semi-fast food establishment, were so high. Lunch for 6 of us was almost $100.",

I am usually not too into Asian food (except thai!), but I was interested in this completely vegetarian place. My mom didn't really want to go but she was hungry and we were in the area so she gave in haha. But she ended up loving it, I think even more so than I did! I do have a few complaints, but it was nothing too bad. The service was very very slow. Three people working and not very many customers and we had to wait for quite a bit. Also every single soda was out, except diet coke. Luckily I don't drink soda, and the only thing my mom wanted was diet coke! We seated ourselves but a server came to take our order pretty quickly. Restaurant was clean but nothing fancy. I started off with a jasmine iced tea and it was tasty. Subtle flavor, but I enjoyed it, the glass it came in was cool, almost like a beer glass haha. As for food I got the vegetable curry. I am not a huge fan of mock meat and my mom isn't either, but they had other options luckily! My curry came with tofu, potatoes, sweet potatoes, I think carrots, and there was a side of brown rice with more vegetables. Some of the vegetables mixed with the rice were almost like cold, was weird. Rice wasn't the best either. But the curry was fantastic! The perfect amount of spice for me. Plus I'm obsessed with sweet potatoes so that helps. My mom got some kind of dish that had eggroll type things on top of noodles. We were both obsessed with the noodles and couldn't stop eating them. We both left feeling very full, but glad to have had a relatively healthy meal with lots of fresh veggies and great flavor. I would certainly return, saw other people's food and thought dang I have to try that!",

For the reviewer who stated you get .60 worth of food, I'm not sure where you eat or how much you expect on a lunch plate.  I leave full and happy.  This is a staple for me and I miss their food when it's been a while. Love Fresh Mint!",

Few ingredients such as their soy based meat is pretty good. However, they can really work on improving overall taste of their entrees.  Most of the entrees I tried have pretty much same type of base sauce, and same type of vegetables. some dishes are loaded with raw boiled vegetables (broccoli, zucchini is standard in all), which kind of offsets the taste. A little bit of seasoning or sauteed vegetables may work better. their spring rolls are amazing, and their tapioca pudding dessert is great too.",

    "text": "I started coming here prior to relocating to PHX.  They were calling themselves a 100% vegan establishment at the time, which disturbed me because they were selling non-vegan desserts and not informing customers of this. I consider that shady. They have since reclassified themselves as 100% vegetarian, so I'll base my review solely on their current status.   First of all, the food is great (for the most part).  My fav dishes are some of the Chef specialties: Kung Pao \"Chicken,\" Black Pepper \"Steak,\" and Soy Fish in Clay Pot - the latter of which is my absolute favorite dish here.  Outstanding flavors and seasonings. Fresh, aromatic jasmine rice. Accompanied by bright and colorful veggies, which are lightly cooked and have almost no seasoning, but it makes you feel like you're eating something healthy, so I don't mind. (I usually eat the veggies first and then dig into the nittty-gritty.)   Vegetable Fried Rice - Very good and flavorful. You have a choice of brown or jasmine rice; I opted for brown.  Cooked with assorted veggies (I omitted the brussels spouts), and veggie beef.  You can add veggie chicken for an extra $2-$4, depending on how much you want.  I got $2 worth of chicken added and it was a decent amount.  Very tasty dish, very filling and a huge portion; it lasted 2 days.  Roasted Potatoes - I got these on the side. They have a kick-@$$ flavor to them, but for $4 you get about 10 little smaller-than-a-tater-tot pieces of potato.  I swear, I looked in the bag, on the car floor, and on the table to see if 1/2 of my potatoes had sprouted legs or wings and flew the coup.  I was THISCLOSE to calling Agent Mulder to report an alien abduction of my taters! But nothing was missing. That was it.  They threw a few pieces of potato chunks into a big-ole box and sent me on my way. Ya know, maybe it wouldn't have been so shocking if they hadn't been put in such a large to-go container.  It only added insult to injury to open that big box and find mere morsels sitting there...laughing at me. This skeet ration needs to come in an appropriately sized munchkin-box, and it shouldn't cost more than $2.  Can you tell that I'm really salty about this skimpily portioned side order??   Imperial Rolls - appetizer.  These were once my favorite appetizer here. They used to be freshly made, fried to golden perfection, and served with a delicious dipping sauce. I can only assume that due to the negative reviews which focused on the wait time for the food, that maybe they changed some things so that some items wouldn't take so long to prepare. (FTR, I never complained about wait time. I appreciate that the good things are worth the wait.)  Well, these rolls now taste like frozen and re-heated rolls, although I've had better frozen spring rolls from the grocery store.  The quality has seriously deteriorated and the rolls were barely edible.  I hate wasting food, but I threw the rolls away after 2 de-appetizing bites.  Lastly, they lost an extra star due to poor service.  There was a kid working the register and taking the to-go orders.  I think he was the owner's kid.  He should not be dealing with customers.  TWA: Teenager with an Attitude + a condescending tone and 0 personality.  The way he said \"it's gonna cost extra\" when I asked to add the veggie chicken to the rice dish, was not in an informative way (which I'd appreciate), it was very rude and snobby. I was instantly livid!  I'll probably go back eventually, but I'm going to wait a while.  However, if I have to deal with that kid the next time, I will walk out.  I can only contain my inner Madea for so long.    I lied..one more thing. They need more vegan dessert options.  Apparently, the only thing keeping them from being a 100% vegan establishment is the fact that they're still selling non-vegan desserts.",

The brown rice was OK, and the salad average. The wait for the food was long, and also to get the check. It would help to have some ready made food for the lunch hour, but according to their website they prepare everything at the time of the order. This might be good for many other dishes on the menu, but a curry gets better when prepared beforehand, and sits a little bit to deliver more flavor......",

In fact going into Fresh Mint, we even made provisions to do a post-meal In-n-Out burger trip just to get our meat fix in for the night. As it turns out, we didn't need to make our 'meat run'... this vegan food is rockin!   We got the kung pao soy chicken and a pad thai... both were very tasty. My soy chicken was so flavorful that if I wouldn't have known any better I'd have thought it was real chicken. The stand out here was the flavor... each dish seemed pretty perfectly seasoned; not too spicy but not too bland either. A lot of character and distinct tastes, which is always good.   Service was pretty good, but nothing amazing. One funny thing that happened, and I don't know if this is a nightly thing or not... but they gave us a stuffed animal when we paid (weird lookin' thing). The guy that gave it to us actually said 'Guys get the check, girls get a doll'. Odd.   Pretty solid place, although for the setting/decor it does seem a tad pricier than it should be.

Tonight, when dining with my family, the restaurant was slammed. I understand that they are a small, family-run joint, but something's gotta give!  My gripe is not with the food but with the service and the owner's poor attitude. During previous visits, he has been able to run the dining room on his own, but tonight he was completely in the weeds.   To start, they were out of their imperial rolls, which I really enjoy. The owner was apologetic but was also completely harried by his other tables and could barely finish a sentence without being called to another set of patrons. We had a last minute addition to our table when another family member called to say he'd be joining us. We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant, but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway.   There was also a large party in the dining room from what seemed to be a radio show that advertises for this restaurant (one of the hosts interrupted our meal to give us a flyer about it) and those patrons were loud and after finishing their meals, hovered other tables to chit-chat. It was quite distracting.   The restaurant itself is tremendously loud and they play upbeat music from the 50's and 60's. This soundtrack would be fine during a lunch rush but not when people are trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with their families.   As for the food, it's adequate. A-OK, even. But the prices are outlandish and the service is unpleasant. We will not be returning as there are many fine, veg-friendly establishments in the city deserving of our business.",

    "text": "So I gave Fresh Mint another try Friday night. My girlfriend got the Golden Soy Chicken, I got the Kung Pao. Service was great and friendly as usual. Another bonus is that brown rice is not more! Everyplace now charges more for the \"unmolested\" rice(if they even have it) and it's ridiculous.  Both dishes were great, the portions turned out to be perfect. Everything had good flavor, the Kung Pao was weak heat wise for me but will be perfect for most.   The only reason this does not get 5 stars on my update is that it is a Vegan Thai/Vietnamese/Whatever place on the Phoenix/Scottsdale line with high end LA Vegan place prices. My Kung Pao was $14 dollars. It is one of the more expensive things on the menu but I had gotten other things and they had just been ok.   If prices were a tad more reasonable then this place would be 5 stars for sure. I understand people need to make a living and you don't go into business to not make a profit but think of other Vegan places in the valley and their prices.",

    "text": "Thank you, Yelpers, for steering me to yet another great restaurant in the valley.   I was worried about taking my parents here - especially my father as he has a limited palate and prefers standard meat & potato dishes, but flavor and presentation of everything quickly quelled those fears.  We started with appetizers - summer rolls with peanut sauce (quite tasty), vegetable soup with mint (I did not try this but my father said it was very good) and BBQ peanut veggie shiskebabs. The kebabs were one of two standouts of the evening, bursting with mouth-watering flavor. Oh so good.   I ordered the golden curry, one of a small handful of gluten-free dishes here. (The lemongrass curry is also GF; will be trying that next time). Abundant with flavor, it was way different than the usual Vietnamese yellow curry dishes I've had. This was sweeter and there was a particular spice used that tasted almost Indian. Cardamom, perhaps?   My father ordered the Kung Pao soy chicken, which had a little too much heat for him, but he ate it anyway because it was so tasty. He kept remarking throughout the meal how colorful the food was. Yes, isn't it amazing what colors vegetables come in, Dad? Yellow! Red! Orange! Green! Purple, even! Obviously, vegetables are not part of my father's standard fare.  My mom had a basic stir-fry (Rainbow something?) which she was quite impressed by. Portions were ample as other reviewers have stated, with the owner telling us he did not want people to leave hungry.  For a table of 4, with appetizers, entrees and a pot of tea, our bill came to $76. This was the other standout of the evening. As my father was getting out his wallet, he was told not to bother. Another patron had paid our entire bill.   We will be back!",

    "text": "Listed here as a Thai restaurant, Fresh Mint actually touts themselves as specializing in Vietnamese cuisine.  Nevertheless, I'm always overjoyed to find Asian restaurants serving vegan food.  And in the Valley?  Even more so.  I tried the summer rolls as an appetizer and the golden soy chicken as an entree.  The rolls were top notch and well-presented, to boot.  Overall, the food was above average.  But the entree was pricier than what I'm used to in SF for the same type of meal.  Not to mention, the portions were a bit skimpy.  That's a bit of a problem, especially since they're just a casual, strip mall joint.  The service was initially welcoming and prompt, but it trailed off as I neared the end of the meal and was looking for my glass to be refilled and the check to be brought.  They've definitely filled a niche out here, so I doubt their shortcomings make a huge difference; they seem to be doing a brisk amount of business.  But if you're unlike most Scottsdale residents who have money burning a hole in their pocket, I wouldn't advise making it a regular habit of coming here.",

Decor is pleasant but I am unsure why they use up 30% of their space for a deli style counter when its all wait served.  Another gripe is with price and vegetarian spots in general. Usually meat is the most expensive item in a dish. If there is no meat then the restaurants costs are lower (not to mention storage and handling savings) so this should be passed on to the consumer. If they offered a $5 lunch menu they would clean up.   Overall I recommend this since it is healthy and quick.",

I tried a few other things on the menu since my first visit, all were delicious, but nothing was as good as the Hot Pot.  We started with the Pho, which apparently is pronounced \"phu'uh\", making my first review even funnier. I had no clue. I progessed on to the Hot Pot (I may have already mentioned its deliciousness) and even got as far as dessert. The cake was magnificent. From what I heard, the mango tapioca was less fantastic. An allergy to mango kept me from trying that one.  I have and will continue to go back to Fresh Mint. This is the best fake meat in Phoenix and one of the best restaurants all around.",

I definitely go there for the food, the value and to support this family-owned business.   As for the recent ratings complaining about the 2 hour wait I can say this is impossible. In addition, if someone spent $60 on lunch for 2 here it would mean they both had an appetizer, entree, drink and dessert and had to be wheeled out in a cart they were so full. I'd like to see you go anywhere in Scottsdale and have a 3 course meal with really tasty beverage and the same quality food they serve at Fresh Mint for $60.  Do yourself a favor.

I had the Eggplant with Basil and he had the Mongolian Soy Beef. Both came with brown rice and a salad. I really liked the portions - they were just right. The eggplant was wonderfully tender and the dressing on the salad was tasty.   The only downsides were that service was a little slow (though quite friendly) and my husband thought the water had a bad smell/taste and he couldn't drink it.

    "text": "Unfortunately I am very disappointed in Fresh Mint. Maybe my expectations are too high because I come from a family of vegetarians who cook Vietnamese food using soy products such as soy chicken, soy beef, and soy fish. First of all, the portion is measly for the high price. I got the golden soy chicken delight, which basically is thinly sliced pieces of gluten with a heavy brown sauce. It was very salty which made me eat more rice with it. Did not justify paying $11. My partner got the curry apple tofu $14, which too was a disappointment. There was no fusion of flavor and the dish lacked depth.  The reason for the one star is because we felt the service was not good. We arrived when no one else was at the restaurant and it still took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Not once did the server come to ask how we were doing. The server also dressed as if he just jumped out of bed, not professional at all. Overall, for the price I expected a lot more.",

The restaurant had a great look, although it's decorated like one of those inexpensive places without servers. It's not -- it's a normal sit-down and be-served place with appropriate prices.  The owner/dad served us and was quite enthusiastic. He likes to pop over with jokes and doesn't notice if one of you is in the middle of a story. If you don't mind the interruption I suppose it's endearing?  I definitely recommend and will be back for sure.   P.S. Try the Mango Coconut Tapioca. Yum!

My inability to muster clever language at 6 am aside, this place really is great. I'm always on the lookout for good vegetarian places and this one was no disappointment.   I was in Scottsdale, AZ for the weekend visiting some relatives and my mom and I decided to try this place for lunch (after I had found it using the \"nearby\" search function of Yelp. And guess what? There was another group dining while we were there and we overheard them say they also found the place on Yelp. Fresh Mint needs one of those stickers on the front door that says \"People Love Us On Yelp.\"  Like I said, this place is vegetarian and probably 90% vegan. So vegans, be not afraid. I ordered the Mushroom Wonder and a bowl of the Vietnamese Hot and Sour Soup, and my mom ordered the Rainbow Wonder with Vegetable soup in a garlicy broth. Both were delish. And from looking over the menu I surmised there probably wasn't a dish that wasn't tasty. Everything looked so good.  This place is mid-priced. Not cheap as dirt, but the food was worth every penny. The owner was super friendly and the atmosphere was clean, fresh, and inviting. My ONLY knock on this place and maybe the reason I didn't give it a 5th star, is that the service was slow. Quite slow. They could probably use another staff member or two during peak hours, but it was just the husband and wife owners and one other employee for Saturday lunchtime. If you're on the go and really need something quick - you're probably better off hitting up the Subway next door. But if you have some time to sit down and enjoy and great lunch or dinner, Fresh Mint is THE place!",

After shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter H&M with my meat-eating best friend, we were absolutely famished. Because the food in that area is way too expensive for my pockets, my best friend recommended Fresh Mint to us. Because it was lunch time, we were able to get the lunch \"to go\" menu, which saved us a few bucks each.   We all shared the Autumn roll, which was delicious but definitely not enough food for how much it cost.  My best friend got the Mongolian Soy Beef - it was fabulous! I absolutely hate most soy beefs and, while the taste wasn't perfect, the texture sure was!   My boyfriend got the tofu curry - I am not a curry fan, so I didn't try it, but he loved it.  I got the kung pow soy chicken and dang, I was surprised. There was a perfect amount of food - not way too much; just enough. The consistency of the chicken was almost perfect (strings and all!), and the sauce was delicious. There were tons of veggies and the salad that came with it was awesome and light and fresh.  The owners are so sweet and friendly. I truly enjoyed eating there.  Oh, and one more thing - the BEST Arnold Palmer I've ever had! Fresh lemonade and fresh iced tea - deeelicious!",

I will say that the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly but the food tends to be either bland or odd tasting and the service is painfully slow even when it is not busy.   The only redeeming quality is that they cater to vegans (who don't know any better than to rate this 5 stars).  I guess it's working for them though.",

The food was so fresh, very flavorful, and beautifully presented. Definitely one of the best places I have eaten recently! Service was also good. Note that they close at 8pm.

    "text": "I am honestly perplexed by the number of positive reviews on this place. Here is the thing, if you are vegetarian or vegan, you can go to practically any Thai restaurant and get something to eat and it would be ten times better than the crap served here. Honestly, the food isn't difficult to cook nor does it cost that much to make. So, the fact that you charge what you do and how much I get to eat (because the portions are tiny and I'm someone who doesn't eat much), it better be darn good. News flash, it is not good...no developed authentic flavor at all. I got the pad thai and my dad got the lo mein. It was funny because my dad's plate wasn't even half covered with noodles...like where was the rest of the dish? We counted three pieces of carrots, four pieces of broccoli, and a sprinkling of cabbage. I'm pretty sure the value of the food on plate amounted to 60 cents which makes the profit margins huge on an $8 lunch special. When my dad addressed the manager, the response was, \"That's how the portion is. We didn't forget anything in your dish\" Umm, wrong answer (regardless if it is True or not)!!! Bravo, you know how to be cheap. Bottom line, don't waste your time or your money here. I don't mind paying for food when I go out but I just ask that if I am paying, I actually get food in return...that's not what we got.",

The rolls were a perfect size to share and the sauce was delicious. I had the vegetable chow mein. I loved the fresh flavor of this dish. My husband had the vegetarian citrus spare ribs OMG it was good! We were seated right away (we were the only ones there). After we ordered customers started coming in and I could see they might be a little shorthanded. They did have a sign posted on the door that they close promptly at 8. My husband and I both left there saying that we wish they had a location in Tucson so we could try everything on the menu. This will be a place we stop to eat whenever we are in the area. If you are looking for fresh, healthy and delicious food this place is for you :-)",

The peanut sauce that comes with the vegetable plate tasted good, but was cold, which we felt was odd to serve with warm vegetables. The servers were nice, but one at least 2 occasions, we needed something for our table and there were no servers to be found.  We were sitting outside, maybe that was the issue.  I had to walk inside the restaurant to call for a server to assist us.  The portions were a little small, especially for the high-ish prices.

Quick search on Yelp and this place popped up so we mosied on over. Small and simple diner-style restaurant in a strip mall. We didn't want a huge meal so hubby and I shared the Fresh Cucumber Rolls to start and followed that with their Curry Apple Tofu. Both generous portions and the cucumber rolls were perfectly refreshing on a sweltering day. I wasn't as keen on their peanut sauce as my hubby but it did the trick. The Curry Apple Tofu was flavorful with a nice bit of spice for heat. We devoured it! Service was friendly and lighthearted. Great prices too. We'd happily stop here again!",

There was dust on top of the surfaces,  splatters on the window blinds, trash bins full in the bathroom.  We were also served dishes in bowls and on plates that were chipped.  Although the food was tasty, it caused all of us to question the food safety,  cleanliness and management, as well as if we would ever return.  It was a huge disappointment.

The flavors were wonderful, and the combination of seasonings in the various dishes we tried were excellent.  We also split the Banana desert, delicious.   Go for a change of pace, it's definitely unique",

I was pretty surprised at the wonderful reviews on yelp. But I guess if you are vegan it is hard to find anywhere to eat. So myself being a meateater, I give it only 3 stars. And that was generious. But if you love vegan food like I do, try green or loving hut!",

The meal was mostly delicious but I am dinging a star because I asked him (the owner was our server) if they could possibly not put sauce on it, and he insisted that the sauce was integrated into the meal and it would be impossible NOT to sauce it. Then the meal arrived and the sauce had been poured on top in copious amounts....but it was not integrated into the meal at all so there was no reason for him to have denied my request. The sauce was sweet, and gross (I hate sweet sauces!) and I'm irked that he ruined an otherwise excellent vegan meal. But he was friendly and nice and he tried to help us select our meals (it was our first time there) and I would definitely return and try some less saucy things.",

Having changed jobs, I find myself in that part of town less, but revisited last week with a vegetarian friend and a girlfriend who dabbles. I, on the other hand, enjoy being an omnivore, but regardless of culinary position, this place is just plain great. I'm amazed at how flavorful the sauces are and the menu is fairly diverse with great choices. It's run by a husband/wife team who do the serving and cooking, so you're basically eating their home-cooked meals. I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant, so you know you're getting quality food.",

I added egg rolls and an iced tea and ended up with a just shy of $18 bill... for lunch!! The food was good though.

Its a cute, clean space and the man running the place greeted me warmly and inquired if it was my first visit. I said yes and told him I had seen the place before when in the area and had always wanted to give it a try. It was lunchtime on a Friday and it was busy, but service was top notch.  They had lunch specials that someone at a table near me commented \"must be new\". I couldn't decide between the kung pao soy chicken and the eggplant dish, but the gentleman taking my order said the Kung pao was a restaurant fave, so I went with that. I'm not a vegetarian, but I sho eat faux meat!- and this was good. It came with a side salad and brown or white rice on the side, and for 8 bucks was a perfectly sized meal. The spice queen in me would have added srircha had it been around, but I didn't ask for it because it really wasn't necessary. There was plenty of sauce that had a little kick to it and being in a \"healthy place\" helped me reason that the added sodium was unnecessary. (Don't know about you, but i like to pretend I'm a health guru when surrounded by the like. Its my own fun game!)  Bottom line- I really liked this place and asked for a to go menu to take to work bc I will return again for the eggplant!",

While I appreciate that everything is made when you order it... An hour seems like an aweful long time to wait for julienned veggies wrapped in raw cucumber with a side of peanut sauce. The pho followed a few moments later. I liked it but my compadres felt it was less than authentic. Bottom line...

They were there probably right before us, so they ordered their app & then maybe 10 minutes later we ordered ours & it took like 15-20 minutes for them to come out. Then the food was like 20 more minutes after that. It's was just really long for some noodles & veggies. We also ordered brown rice but they forgot it.

Mostly for the fact that it's vegan and doesn't do all crappy vegan processed food...   I've been here twice and both times ordered carry out - first time was so long ago that I can't recall what I had besides a thai iced tea.    Today I opted for their Fresh Mint Salad ($8), and I wanted it to be more traditional Vietnamese so I ordered vermicelli noodles on the side ($3-4). I was hoping the salad would be a bit more 'shredded' rather than diced, but it was good. The flavors are somewhat bland -- they don't use too many spices, herbs, (NO MSG) etc but I was really needing a good, clean, light taste. I also got their thai iced tea (made with coconut milk) - $4. Their thai iced teas are PHENOMENAL, but they are pricey comparatively (which is FINE BY ME! as long as I know it's vegan and not made with crappy condensed milk).  All in all - the food is healthy and light - but don't expect robust/rich/salty/greasy/oily tastes as you would expect in your local Chinese/Asian veggie stir fry. (Hey guys, that means it's better for you). Their noodle/stir fry may be different altogether, but that's not the vibe I got. It's a bit pricier than the average lunch if you order off the regular menu -- otherwise they have $8 lunch specials (but it's vegan and healthy-- to me that's worth it).   I'd like to come back and try one of the lunch specials or entrees. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but I'd come back. Psst, they also have a gluten free menu! YAY.   Cons: I wish they'd stop using styrofoam containers and plastic bags.",

    "text": "Although it's on Scottsdale Rd I must admit it'd be easily overlooked given it's located in the center of a strip mall.  The dining area is small but bright.  Upon entering at lunchtime I found a full house but was welcomed with a smile.  Thankfully there was a small table in the rear that was perfect for me since I was dining alone.  Per their website, Fresh Mint puts a Vietnamese twist on regular vegetarian dishes.  All of their dishes are 100% vegetarian and made only when ordered to guarantee freshness.   Although I could order off of the regular menu I was grateful for the lunch menu that offered several of their main dishes for a lunch time price, which also helped me narrow down my entree of choice. One drawback I found is that the regular dinner prices of entrees cost up to  $14, which is more expensive than I'd like to pay for the location and ambiance of Fresh Mint.  This is not necessarily something that would keep me from eating here but I would definitely keep in mind. Maybe I'll just stick to lunch.  Ultimately I chose the Kung Pao Soy Chicken that contains spicy classic Kung Pao sauce with garlic, white and green onions, soy chicken, zucchini, bell pepper, carrots and peanuts  I patiently waited for my food while I enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle of the lunchtime crowd.  In addition, my seat was located right next to the bar where the rolls and salads were being prepared.  Soon my lunch arrived. I've found that I prefer my tofu pretty well done and not squishy inside, so I'm always hesitant to try new dishes...but my tofu was done perfectly!  With that being said, I'm sure you're not surprised that I ate every morsel of food on my plate.",

    "text": "I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I walked into this restaurant. I just wanted to test out what the vegan and vegetarian scene was like in Arizona while vacationing. Initially when I walked in, no one greeted me and I walked to the counter. I was directed to a table, and the same guy who directed me there came back to take my order. The service started off a bit shaky. I asked him what exactly was the soy fish made out of. His response, \"A soy product.\" I was trying to get specifics: tempeh? tofu? TVP? For all I know it could've been made of seitan. I ignored the vague response and ordered the meal. The moment I tasted the first bite, I loved it. The waiter became much friendlier after I told him I loved the food. I'm not sure what the change of heart was, but I took it. That Soy Fish in a Clay Pot was delicious. The only downside was the restaurant doesn't have a good dessert option if you're vegan. It's real dairy cake. I'm not a big fan of tapioca pudding, especially with mandarin, but I gave it a shot. It's okay. Not great. It looks like snot to me, but it tastes all right. Would I go there again? Absolutely. I wouldn't order that tapioca ever again (and shouldn't have in the first place but I was trying to be adventurous), but it's a quaint restaurant, easy to travel to and even the lemonade was great.",

Came across this place on yelp and am so glad I tried it.   Kung pao soy chicken - amazing! Golden soy chicken delight - delicious! Summer spring rolls - refreshing on hot summer nights!  I have a mushroom allergy and they told me they'd refund my soup order as it had mushroom powder - very thoughtful and great attention to detail in ensuring I was a happy customer.   Order to delivery was less than 60mins and the lady who brought my delivery was so sweet. The whole experience was great. Will definitely order from here every time I'm in town! Thanks for going out of your way for me. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Food was delicious and I'd rate it 4 stars. Service, cleanliness, and ambience only 3 stars.   There was a \"help wanted\" sign in the front and they definitely seemed in need of it. This was my first time coming to Fresh Mint so I was eager to hear about our server's favorite dishes. Unfortunately, he wasn't very patient or friendly. Not sure if he was the owner or what but he didn't seem to have enough time to devote to customers and he also seemed to be doing a bunch of jobs at once. People that were ordering takeout seemed frustrated about the wait time. I was also quite surprised they don't offer a kids menu given they are located next door to Modern Milk and across the street from Musicology, which are literally hubs for moms and their kids. I was hoping the server would at least take the time to give some kid friendly recommendations, but he didn't and instead I felt rushed. It was pretty clear they didn't have enough staff to handle everything effectively.  In terms of the ambience, the place wasn't super clean. There was dust behind the serving counter and the soda machine had 3 \"out of order\" signs out of 6 fountain drinks...not a good look. There was also a mildew crust around the entire fountain drink machine - yuck! The furniture and decor were pretty outdated too.  The food tasted great and I actually would return because it really was good. We ordered the fresh summer roll and fresh cucumber roll -- both were indeed fresh but the cucumber roll was better; the summer roll didn't have much flavor. Both came with peanut dipping sauce which was pretty good. For entrees we ordered their rainbow wonder which came with an abundance of vegetables and the sauce was quite flavorful. Not the biggest portions, especially since it wasn't on the lunch menu, cost $11.95, and I didn't have enough for left overs. My friend ordered the kung pao soy chicken which was very flavorful. It was on the lunch menu so it was offered at a reduced price (I believe around $8) but it also wasn't enough for left overs.   All in all, the food was great and I'd return for it but hopefully they fix some of the cosmetic and service issues to make it a more pleasurable dining experience overall.",

Luckily, we didn't have any such issues the night we dined in. We waited appx 8-10 minutes for our food. We had the yellow curry and the Imperial Roll Noodles. Yellow curry was good - but it lacked a certain flavor. Satisfying in the sense that it was filling, but not in the sense of authenticity. I definitely can name a few other places I'd rather have curry at. The noodle bowl was on point - loved that they didn't skimp on the veggie rolls. Could've used a little more vinegar sauce though - split between the salad and the actual noodles - it needed just a bit more. I suppose I could've asked... ha!   Service was fine. Nothing too special, but not lacking either. The person whom I assumed was the manager served as the hostess and the person checking people out. He was mostly attentive.  Honestly, this place is a wonderful idea. There's a lot of tasty sounding dishes on the menu and one's that honestly I'd love to come back and try. Prices aren't crazy by any means, but $15 for any of the Chef's Specials - I sorta shrug my shoulders at because they don't seem THAT amazing. Like c'mon, $15 for veg chow mein?? I think I'd rather go to an authentic Chinese restaurant and get my pan fried noodles for $8. Hot pot might be worth it - but the mock meat dishes- not so much.   We definitely want to come back, but it's not at the top of the list...",

I was thrilled that they offer a small size of their soups, including the Pho, which meant I could also order an appetizer (as typically the full size bowls of Pho are too much to get appetizers).  I got their Veggie Kabobs which were wonderfully flavorful with the seasonings on them, and the aforementioned small Five Spice Vegetable Soup (Pho), which was a tad on the bland side until I used a little of the hot sauce which made all the difference. It could have used some basil, which the menu said it came with, but mine came with parsley instead. Not quite the same.   Will definitely have to come back and try some other items on the menu.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting my friend last weekend, who is pescetarian, and as I am leaning more toward vegan and vegetarian fare these days, she suggested this place for lunch last Saturday (September 12), and I obliged.  The place was fairly empty when we arrived, nice and cool inside, and the owner, who was also our server (and apparently knows my friend as a regular, as they joked around a bit), seems like a very nice guy.  I really like Thai iced coffee or iced tea, having had Thai iced coffee before at a restaurant in Maryland, so I greedily ordered a glass!  I was pleased that the drink came in a very tall glass, which sufficed my craving for it and quenched my thirst immediately.  I decided to order what my friend did (without extra peanuts! LOL), which was the Lemongrass Soy Beef Delight as my main, and she and I shared an appetizer of summer rolls.  The summer rolls, themselves, were lacking in taste, but that's what the peanut sauce is for, and the sauce made a very nice accompaniment to the rolls.  I was worried about the spice level of the Lemongrass Soy Beef Delight, but it actually was very mild, and I enjoyed it.  My friend and I decided to indulge ourselves and share a piece of carrot cake, and we loved it!  OMFG--heaven on a plate!!  Check out the picture, and you'll see why.  When I'm back in town, I will definitely go here again!  :D",

I ordered the citrus spare ribs, which were so good that I ate the leftovers at the airport the next morning (that's saying something, for a business traveler!), and the lemongrass noodle soup, which was so generously portioned (and packed perfectly for takeout so the noodles didn't get mushy) and amazingly flavorful!  The broth was to die for and I'm usually a little underwhelmed by pho broth.  I also went a little crazy and ordered the autumn rolls, which were fresh and tasty.  I live in NYC and wish I had this place near my home!  I will definitely return here for the delicious food and friendly service when I'm back in the area!",

The owner is the chef and her husband waits the tables. He could use a few lessons on waiting tables. He is a bit harsh, and he clearly does not like to be asked questions. He is not a draw for new business and probably would be better off staying behind the counter. The food however is as good as any vegetarian restaurant that I've even dined at. Flavored nicely with a wonderful variety. We will go back to sample more dishes. they accept reservations which is great because the place is so small. The salads are incredible as are the soups.",

They asked us to try some vegan desserts after main course and we ordered carrot cake (they did not tell us this before that they had eggs in it)  I heard somebody talking and asking ingredients and I also asked and then they disclosed. I was seriously annoyed with this service. When I asked owner why the hell they are serving this nonsense cakes to cheat on customers, and he explained proudly that they are kosher and no vegan bakeries in Scottsdale, AZ!! I explained two times that why cake is so important!  Can't they serve vegan desserts apart from cake s if they are not available, in a vegan restaurant and he could not understand or accept it.  I see a clear strategy to make couple of more dollars on every order without notifying customers in the name of cakes having eggs.  BEWARE THIS IS NOT A VEGAN RESTAURANTS IT HAS ANIMAL INGREDIENTS IN MANY OF THEIR ITEMS!!!  I had drunk lots of salt with hot water later on and had 3-4 vomits after it by manually inserting fingers in my throat to clean my stomach.  NEVER VISIT AGAIN!",

This is not a good place to come and dine-in if you have limited time (such as a lunch break). The service is pretty slow. Even slower if there are a lot of people dining during a peak time. I recommend calling for takeout if you are on a tight schedule.  If you have plenty of time and don't mind waiting a little while, I feel that it is worth it. Everything I have tried has been very good. My favorite is the Sesame Soy, which is teriyaki-style tofu with sesame seeds sprinkled on top, with a side of rice and steamed vegetables.  One thing I found a little weird, though it isn't necessarily a bad thing, was that they only give forks to eat with. They have other utensils if you need them, but you have to ask.  I am not a vegetarian anymore, but I still greatly enjoy vegetarian and vegan food. I recommend this place to pretty much everyone if they enjoy good, clean food and don't mind a little wait to get it.",

While the pictures on the internet led me to believe the restaurant was more upscale, it was a clean and cozy space located in one of Scottsdale's many strip malls.  I started off dinner with an appetizer of cucumber rolls - light and tasty.  For my entree, I tried the curry apple tofu with brown rice.  It was flavorful and filling.  The portion size was just right.   Against my better judgment (as I mentioned, the entree was filling), I went in for dessert.  The coconut mango tapioca could have been skipped.  The flavor was okay but the consistency was runny for my tastes.  Overall, I found Fresh Mint delightful.  The owner was extremely attentive and personable.

The broth was a little lighter (less flavorful) than traditional beef Pho, but that's to be expected if there's no beef.  The hoisin and sriracha served on the side helped a lot.  The soup was served with a nicely plated stack of cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, a few sprigs of cilantro, and lime wedge.  I was a little disappointed at the lack of cilantro and basil.  The soup did contain tofu and some very interesting fake beef, which wasn't bad.  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch.  Service was excellent even though the place was very busy for lunch.  The other dishes I saw being served looked very good.  I'd be willing to come back and try another dish (maybe the Kung Pao \"chicken\"?)  Decor is a mix of trendy/hipster, kind of like a Pita Jungle feel to it.  (Tip to management, you might want to iron the tablecloths.  This doesn't bother me but you are in the middle of one of the snobbiest parts of Scottsdale so just a suggestion.)  For Pho, I will stick to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this place to a Vegetarian/Vegan friend, though.",

We arrived around 2:30 pm and were greeted immediately by the owner.  He told us to take a seat where ever we wanted and he'd bring menus and silverware.  We sat outside.  We ordered the spring rolls to start and my mom got the Pho.  The spring rolls came out quickly and were oh so good!  My moms soup came out a few minutes later and it was quite large for the small.  We ended up sharing it and it was also really good.  We ordered the pepper steak and the hot pot...both to share.  The pepper steak was amazing!  The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was pure yumminess.  It came with some roasted potatoes that were crispy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside.  I had never had a hot pot before.  I really didn't know what to expect. At first I didn't think it was as good as the pepper steak.  I think that's because it was in fact, extremely hot (temperature hot) and that took away from the flavor.  As it cooled down though, the flavors came through and it was every bit as good as the pepper steak.  There are so many other dishes I can't wait to try.  Great service, great food.  Looking forward to going back.",

    "text": "My husband and I, visiting here from Washington, D.C., had a mixed experience at Fresh Mint. We both ordered soups (Pho and Fresh Garden Vegetable Soup) that were meh -- we were expecting bolder broths. Note that the \"small\" soups are actually huge portions. Luckily, the entrees were better. We each had tofu curries that were yummy and satisfying.The Golden Curry Vegetables is excellent, while the Fresh Lemongrass Tofu was solidly good.   My husband used to manage restaurants, and he and I agree that the single thing that Fresh Mint could do to improve its restaurant is hire more employees. There seemed to be one hot cook, one cold prep cook, and one waiter (the owner, we think) for the entire restaurant, which was full at lunch hour. It took us 90 minutes for lunch from the time we walked in to the time we got our check -- too long for a weekday lunch. We were especially surprised that it took almost 30 minutes to get the soup appetizers, which are all pre-made, out of the kitchen. We had a leisurely schedule, but other diners might not. If you have the option of dining at Fresh Mint during non-rush times, it might be a better bet. The food was good, but we'd have to seriously weigh whether to make a return trip based on the time it took us to get served.   I couldn't find Fresh Mint's Web site with a Web search before I went there, but it's <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffreshmint.us.com&s=fcb83c46bc2d7c17ce86e8043784768477a94e91196d47738cae0e90b6ba3653\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">freshmint.us.com</a>.",

The peanut dipping sauce was tasty, although a little thick... which was actually nice. I had the Pad Thai as an entree and the salad that came with it was super fresh and tasty. I usually like my salad served with a side of lettuce and enough other junk to qualify it as not so healthy (hello, blue cheese!). This salad was good and it didn't leave me missing anything. The Pad Thai wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but the broccoli on top made up for it. Ryan had the Chicken and veg. Well, the SOY chicken and veg. I couldn't help but crack a joke about what I like to have when I'm craving some chicken.... actual chicken. I have to admit the soy chicken was good and the texture was stellar. His had more spice and was super tasty.   Top it off with a hot cup of Jasmine tea and I was happy.   We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "First off, let's give some praise to the concept: A vegan, vietnamese-style, Kosher restaurant? That's the coolest thing I've heard since someone explained nonstick frying pans to me. Unfortunately, the service can be a bit slow, and a bit weird, but you've got to give them some credit for opening a place like this.  Most of the dishes are composed of rice/noodles, steamed veggies, and one of their vegan meats like chicken, beef, ribs, fish, etc., doused in sauce. It's awesome sauce (saucesome?) but it pretty much negates a lot of the healthier aspects of the dish. Why not wait to add those extra calories with some vegan carrot or chocolate cake instead? As far as recommendations, the lemongrass tofu rolls and green papaya salad are both light, filling and fresh tasting dishes. If you're a sauce-o-holic, opt for the tasty BBQ citrus spare ribs or soy fish in a clay pot.  ....For those of you who don't want to read any of that, refer to the short & sweet version below:  Concept: hell yeah. Service: weird. Selection of \"meat\": awesome. Vegan desserts: much appreciated. Dishes: varied & satisfactory. Sauces: too heavy. Overall: 3.5 stars. I'll probably go back at some point.",

Ate them all then fell ill the rest of the night from heartburn, indigestion, and bloating. First and LAST time to The Fresh Mint! Change your menu and portions or be closed by this time next year.",

    "text": "Consistent.  Fresh Mint offers a very consistent product.   This is a vegetarian restaurant with a Kosher designationl. The menu is Asian, with traditional dishes served with tofu or just veggies.  The tofu is flavored/shaped as with it's more traditional dish (i.e. Kung Poa has chicken-flavored tofu, Beef dishes taste more like beef).  Personally, I prefer plain tofu over flavored and they will substitute to your taste.  Also, for GF'ers, they do have some dishes that are GF (no soy sauce--such as curries).  No upcharges for any subs or even brown rice...  At lunch, hardly a seat is available. It's nice to see that this is more crowded than the fast food joint that is closer to the street.  A slight tention can be felt for the business of the staff; however, this restaurant is consistant every time...it's worth trying folks.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  The food was extremely bland and lacking in distinctive flavor.  We had four dishes:  (1) kung pao \"chicken.\"  The fake chicken was very chewy and didn't have any chicken flavor.  There was no heat (spice) whatsoever in the dish.  I have had vegetarian chicken kung pao elsewhere that was delicious.  This was not.  (2) Eggplant with basil and tofu.  Small amounts of tofu that looked like crinkle cut fries.  Minimal basil flavor.  Minimal spice.  (3) Mushroom wonder.  This dish was a tad better.  Meaty mushrooms and sauteed onions along with the vegetables.  The \"special\" sauce was somewhat sweet and not at all special.  (4) Vegetable chow mein.  My friend opted for the soft noodles.  It was essentially soup.  I don't understand how chow mein can come out in a bowl of broth.  She did seem to like it.  My husband pronounced it bland.  Also the food did not come out particularly hot and got cold very quickly.    We had the coconut tapioca for dessert.  I haven't had it before so can't compare it to other versions but it was ok.    Yes, the food is expensive for what you get but I would gladly pay it if the food was good.  This food is not worth your time or money unless you will only eat at a vegan restaurant and insist on going out.",

The interior was very inviting with it's shades of green, and A/C. But I choose outside on green furniture. Not just patio furniture but wooden chairs and good tables. But if my shirt was any thinner I would have splinters in my back. The wooden chairs are worn from the weather outside.  I placed my order for the golden soy chicken delight. It was delicious. Chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside a perfect portion or excellently cooked veggies. Broccoli, squash, peppers, and cauliflower. And my choice of jasmine or brown rice chose jasmine and it was good. Dessert and mint flavored drinks were tempting but I just had my meal and water and walked out for under twelve bucks. The reason I am giving it a 4 instead of five was the splintery chairs and patio floor needs to be pressure washed.",

I'm glad to have another vegetarian/vegan restaurant option of this caliber in town.  We started off the meal with the Fresh Summer Rolls, followed by the Lotus Salad, an order of Stir Fried Noodles and the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. The rolls were large and quite filling on their own. Next, we split an order of Lotus Salad; with fresh squeezed lime on top it was divine. Crisp, crunchy and cool... perfect for a summer lunch. The Stir Fried Noodles were very good too, but the real standout was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken... I couldn't stop eating it! We finished everything and I was very satisfied. The interior is immaculate and service is very friendly. I will definitely be adding this restaurant to my rotation of favorites...",

If the owner is working he tries but always seems overwhelmed. If the waitress they have is working you should bring your own drink and don't expect anything more than a head nod.

This place is nothing special to look at, located on a pad in a strip shopping center but, the food is very, very good.  Tonight we had the spring rolls, summer rolls, pad thai, and kung pao chicken.  All the dishes were just perfect with the fresh vegetables cooked to perfection.  Portions are generous and the price is right.  This is a vegetarian joint so be aware, the chicken is NOT chicken.  It is run by a husband and wife team out of Hawaii (wife cooks, husband serves)and they definitely have their following of regulars.  The muzak is 60s-70s generation which I enjoyed.  Great value, great food.  Will be back for sure.",

It had fake beef in it and was sweeter then normal Pho but was really really tasty. I would go back just for the soup.  The bathrooms were really nice.

I had their Spicy Lemongrass Tofu (extra spicy!) with brown rice, and I could not find a single thing wrong with the dish. Being a lunch special ($8 for a perfect portion -- amazing, right?) it came with the rice (no upcharge for brown!) and a salad. The dressing on the salad was just right; not too bold, not too bland, just delicious. Then the main meal... wow. First off, I was impressed by the spice, which doesn't happen often. I'll eat some crazy spicy things, so when I ask for \"extra spicy,\" I want them to bring the heat... and bring it they did! Now I'm not saying this was nuclear hot. It was, again, just right. A couple beads of sweat formed on my forehead, but it didn't interrupt the flavor at all or leave my mouth feeling like Death Valley. Moving on from that, the flavor was incredible, the portion was just the right amount to fill me up; I could not find a single flaw with the food.  The only warning I will give is, beware the lunch rush! This place is small and has great food, which means it *will* fill up! This can make service a little bit slow at times when they get overwhelmed, but it is well worth the wait if you've got the time.",

The trouble started when the owner, a white man, asked me why I didn't have a \"vietnamese nose\". I was taken aback, and did not know how to respond. I said, \"what do you mean?\" he replied, \"you know, wider and flatter. You know, my wife is Chinese and raised in Vietnam.\" I was flabbergasted. I mean, I know he wasn't intending to be hurtful or borderline racist or whatnot, but it really bothered me that he felt he could say this to a complete stranger, let alone a patron in his restaurant, and that he felt justified simply because his wife is asian?? All I could muster up was \"uhhh you'll find that people can look a variety of ways.\"    I don't know, even though he apologized, my husband and I were left with a very bad taste in our mouths and we ended up leaving before we could order.   The owner was just weird, unprofessional, and inappropriate. It doesn't matter if the food is good, we weren't even able to get to that point.  It all turned out great though, because we ended up going to Green (see my review) that was close by, and it ended up being even better.",

Yes you read that right, 100 percent.   Locally owned by a couple and inspired by Vietnamese cuisine. Located in a big strip mall but the restaurant itself isn't that big.   There were so many delicious sounding dishes on the menu that we ordered a few plates to share.   We ordered the fresh cucumber rolls,Five spice noodle soup, rainbow wonder. All of which were extremely tasty and beautiful and color. I really enjoy the dipping sauce for the fresh cucumber rolls. I would describe this plate as a \"raw\" vegetable sushi roll.   The five spice noodle soup could've had a little bit more flavor although it was still good. I really enjoyed how there was sauce and some other vegetables on the side to put into the soup if you would like.  I almost forgot about the fried vegetable imperial rolls which were super scrumptious. They were fried to perfection and had a perfect crunch accompanied by a sweet savory dipping sauce.   My favorite of all it was the rainbow wonder it was a beautiful dish composed of a wide variety of vegetables on top of brown rice. The food came out in a prompt manner and the service was OK.   I took my non-vegan family with me to this restaurant and they all enjoyed the food even though at times they are Skeptical of vegan food lacking flavor. However they were impressed and enjoy all of the food that they tried.   I want to make the prices seem a little bit high for what the food was, however if I was in the area again I would definitely come back.",

My daughter had the chow mein and a slice of carrot cake.  She said it was the most amazing carrot cake ever. I had the hot pot and it was so flavorful and delicious with so many textures and flavors.  It is the best vegan dish I have ever eaten.",

I ordered the curry and brown rice and it was perfectly cooked and portioned for a lunch special. I would have preferred it to be a bit spicier and will request that on my next visit.   Service was very good as I was checked on a number of times and was able to get in and out during a lunch break. Yupper Fresh Mint goes right in to the lunch rotation.",

We ordered the autumn roll, sweet and sour soup, lemongrass curry, and the coconut tapioca for desert. The food was GREAT! My favorite was the soup.   We went on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm, the place wasn't full but had a good amount of people. When we walked in we weren't sat or greeted by anyone. Since this was our first time, we made our way to the cash register assuming that's where we ordered. Told the man it was our first time, ordered our food. He thought we were ordering to-go since we ordered at the register, we told him no, we were dining in and then he sat us. After that, the service was great. The food came out quickly and the server was nice and attentive. To be fair, there was only one person taking the orders and another running the food.   Definitely will be coming back here because the food was just top notch. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Eek! Methinks not, indeed!  Okay, I never usually give a place a 1 star because I have this moral dilemma with it... BUT, I also never usually walk out of a restaurant.   So, I walked in, was awkwardly greeted, and told to have a seat. It was lunch time, so the place was full, but not overflowing with stressed out customers. In all honesty, it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside.   *I'd also like to note that I read reviews for slower than average service, so I was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food*  Once I sat down, I noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me, but he never came over with one for me. I decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes. That's when I started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me, and to sum it up:  I don't know if we can stay and eat, we might have to get it to go.. We've been waiting a long time.  Again, that's not verbatim, but it's exactly along those lines. I figured the reviews were right about the food prep times, and continued to wait.   After a few more minutes passed by, another couple walked in, were acknowledged and seated, and after a minute, they were given menus (This is about 8-10 minutes in). It was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me. He then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me. With no menu, water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at Fresh Mint, I got up and walked out.  A good way to lose a customer is to not serve them. With service complaints since 2008 on Yelp, I really think something needs to be done. That was unbelievably insulting.",

My friend and fellow YES member is a vegetarian so I thought this would be a good place to get some context about what a good vegan/vegetarian restaurant is. My only other vegetarian experiences were with South Indian restaurants which I love but its time to explore new options.  We came at lunch time on a Saturday when it first opened, no lines or crowds.   My vegetarian friend ordered the popular Fresh Mint tofu rolls. They were excellent and I can see why they are so popular. We shared a bowl of the lemongrass soup. I didn't see pictures of the lotus salad on Yelp or the website but I was expecting lotus root instead of lotus shoots. However, it was delicious! I appreciated that it lightly dressed with vinaigrette allowing the veggies to stay crisp. I noticed many other reviewers thought the flavors was bland which I disagree with. There are far too many Asian restaurants relying heavily on MSG.  I was surprised at how full I felt after the meal which was devoid of animal protein. According to her standards the restaurant was solid and a great representation for vegetarian ethnic food. I would love to come back and try the curry and perhaps an eggplant dish.",

I opted for the Mongolian beef at the recommendation of another patron. It was flavorful... perhaps a little too flavorful.

    "text": "Fresh Mint may be my favorite vegetarian restaurant in town. However, it's important to note that it is not 100% vegan, and the menu doesn't mark the non-vegan items but I believe it is just the shell of the imperial rolls (egg rolls). Ask before ordering!  Beyond that - Fresh Mint is one of the rare veg. restaurants in town that clearly make every meal with love. I say that, because I've observed Chef Mai Ly and her husband for many years, and the tenderness and respect they have for each other is so touching.   While I've had many favorite items over time, my current go-to is the  veggie kabob to start, with the golden soy chicken delight for my entree. The kabobs are all about the BBQ peanut sauce - it's lick-the-plate good. I might actually try to get a different starter served with it next visit, because I love all of the rolls, but the regular peanut sauce is just good, not amazing.  Fresh Mint uses a lot of \"mock meats\" but to me they are much better than the mock meats served in other restaurants in town. The \"chicken\" in the golden soy chicken delight is thinly sliced and textured like real chicken - including a bumpy skin! It's almost too real! But the most important part is how it absorbs the soy ginger sauce. I worship this sauce. It's slightly sweet, but has the ginger snap to it. It's served with bountiful steamed rice (or brown if you prefer) which I use to mop up the left-over sauce. It's also served with fresh, lightly steamed broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, squash and carrots. I eat those if I get around to it at the end...   Other favorite items include the fresh cucumber rolls, the spicy lemongrass noodle soup (especially if you have a cold!), the sesame soybean, the spicy ginger soy beef (probably my 2nd favorite entree), the black pepper steak, and the stir fried noodles. I used to get the chow mein all the time, but then I found out the crispy noodles its served on (like a bird's nest) are not vegan. I could still get it with soft noodles, but that would be less fun.  My husband loves the fresh lemongrass tofu - which is a very unique dish. It's little pinwheels of rolled tofu and seaweed, served with a ginger sauce.  For desert, anything with their tapioca is great, but ask to make sure it's vegan (if you are a plant-based diner). I think the fritters may not be vegan.  Service is usually great, unless they are slammed. Mai Ly's husband Michael is usually the only waiter, or sometimes he has a couple of people to help in both the front and back ends of the restaurant. Mai Ly makes everything to order, so don't expect instant delivery, but I've never waited excessively. Expecting a little wait is also a good excuse to get an appetizer! The restaurant is clean and casual, and for some reason their water tastes very good to me. Maybe they add cucumber?  In summary - if you are vegan, vegetarian or veg-curious and want a healthy, flavorful meal, give them a try! Mock meats can be a challenge for some people, but they have plenty of veg-only or tofu items as well to pick from. And Michael can help you find something on the menu for everyone.",

When I got home it was still somewhat warm and very delicious.   The gluten free stir fry noodles come with rice noodles stir fried with bright delicious fresh veggies such as red cabbage, bell peppers, and celery, among others. The sauce that it's in is one that I crave and I wish I could figure out what it was so I can make it at home.   This place is perfect if you're vegetarian or vegan.",

    "text": "For True Vegans, there still aren't a lot of choices to dine out.  Asian cuisine Fresh Mint is my favorite local Vegan restaurant.  From the various delicious appetizer rolls to the authentic Pho to the meatless main courses, everything is prepared with care and quality.  Taste is abundant in any dish and the parings are perfect.  Asian is easy for non-Vegans to try because many dishes are vegetarian to begin with, so meat alternatives aren't required for a delicious try.",

There is both indoor and outdoor seating and ample lot parking available. I sat inside and I ordered the Lemongrass Vegan Beef dish with rice vermicelli noodles. I needed to add a little more spice with some Sriracha but overall the entree was good and I finished it all. The sever was very attentive and made sure that I had everything I needed and I will definitely make a return visit to try some of the other options.",

Gross that there was old lipstick stains on our glasses but then our silverware was pretty dirty too. They took awhile to get to our table and there only two other parties with two people each.  I felt bad but we decided to leave :(",

    "text": "I found out about this place in my Phoenix hotel room as I was channel surfing and landed on a show called \"Check, Please! Arizona\" where three really polite women were describing their favorite local restaurant to the semi-interested host. The funny thing is that I was on an episode of \"Check, Please! Bay Area\" several years ago where I was one of three heavily opinionated people defending our restaurant choices as the host was pounding Chardonnay. What drew me here was that it was a well-regarded vegetarian place with an Asian accent much like the excellent Veggie Village (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2uJzEZT&s=8774e8158909bd057b61d6e1b7d6876bdf2ecb4ee7ab40c095875e7b75581447\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2uJzEZT</a>). Will lightning strike twice?  Phoenix always surprises me with its geographic size as it took me almost an hour to get here from Peoria where I was staying. The restaurant turned out to be in the middle of a shopping center parking lot which I have noticed is a common piece of real estate for a lot of eateries here. I must have been early because I was their first customer of the evening, and it looked like the manager was still working on the books at one of the tables. As I indulgently sidled into a booth that could easily fit four, it didn't take me long for me to figure out what to order because it all sounded organic and healthy to me. I first tried the $5.95 Fresh Cucumber Rolls which I first saw on the show.  They rolled up fried tofu, marinated julienne white radish, carrot, and fresh mint, and vermicelli noodles, all rolled up in a thin slice of cucumber and served with a thick and delectable peanut sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2jcfEbp&s=8abb2e9e3278a6f2a1ddb2aa9a3a38ffefa8624dc097c6c40c9e01dca9352037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2jcfEbp</a>). I frankly couldn't get enough of those. The same price Autumn and Summer Rolls appeared just as appetizing. For my entree, I ordered the $11.95 Rainbow Wonder, an abundant platter of stir-fried vegetables in seven different colors (thus the apt name) along with shiitake mushrooms, all of it mixed with a sesame-ginger garlic sauce and accompanied by brown rice (photo <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2AYQh42&s=ae50c943842a4d21ee18c44e185330fe7fd1d74e4649bfa63b58e8f60785deec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2AYQh42</a>). Just perfect for a late summer meal.  FOOD - 5 stars...simple executions of really healthy dishes, well turned with an Asian twist AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...unsurprisingly green and more fast food-looking than expected but still quite peaceful SERVICE - 4 stars...attentive even if I was the only one in there TOTAL - 5 stars...Chef May Li has figured out an epicurean niche for her bountiful dishes and it works",

No animal products enter the kitchen. We had the kung pao chicken and soy beef and both were absolutely amazing, with the only criticism being that they were a bit salty.

It took about 6 min and I was given my 3 compartment Styrofoam box.  Inside the main compartment was the Mongolian beef with fancy cut carrots onions and celery. Brown rice on the side (a nice no charge up grade) and a small salad. Not bad for $8.  The Mongolian beef was decent not evident it was faux cow, the veggies were crisp the sauce was a bit bland however. The rice was cooked well and the salad was fresh and crisp. The portion size was a bit smaller than some one of my size would like.   That is the key to \"healthily food\", less food what a great business model.",

    "text": "This place is legendary!  Back-story: So my mom desperately needed a break from taking care of my father who just had a total knee replacement and I decided to take her out to lunch. Now, my mom is a picky eater and generally only goes to the same three restaurants for lunch and dinner, so when I asked her where she wanted to go and she deferred the question back to me, I responded in a sarcastic tone \"Fresh Mint, its a vegan restaurant that is pretty amazing,\" thinking she would ignore the suggestion and say \"let's go to Chili's\". Well, I don't know know if she was high on my Dad's Vicodin or the world is indeed ending in December of 2012, but she actually agreed and off we went to the strip mall on Thunderbird and Scottsdale.  Restaurant-story: The restaurant itself is small, but because two of the walls are glass windows it doesn't give you a claustrophobic feel and somehow the neon green and bright purple walls (which had a giant metal mint leaf on it) help out as well. There are three booths, which could sit four (skinny people) comfortably, four four-top tables, and four two-top tables, with a few tables outside.   We were greeted immediately by one of the co-owners (the husband) who let us choose where we would like to sit (there was only one table occupied) and handed us our menus. My mother ordered a plain iced tea and I decided to mix it up and go with their Thai iced tea. This deliciousness consists of Thai tea, a little bit of sugar, and coconut milk. I found it to be super sweet and rich that it should be considered a dessert as opposed to a routine drink with meals.  The portions here are a decent size and the lunch time prices are perfect. We split the Fresh Autumn Rolls($6), Fresh Island Green Salad ($9), and the Steamed Veggies served with a side of peanut sauce. Everything was so fresh tasting and even my mother enjoyed everything! She actually said she would come back to this place for lunch anytime, leaving Fresh Mint legendary in my book!",

My friend ordered the cucumber rolls and they were just a sliver of cucumber with a huge chunk of unseasoned tofu and a carrot and maybe a radish sliver. There was another very heavy peanut sauce on the side. My friend said the flavor of the peanut sauce was ok but the rolls needed some flavor and sauce heavy for the dish. Unfortunate because I would love to find a nice vegan place close to home. Will stick to True food, green or loving hut.",

    "text": "Tried this place out on a whim just the other day and, not being a vegan or a vegetarian, but liking Asian style food in general, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was far from disappointed by the end of the meal!   Arriving early for the lunch hour, there wasn't much of a crowd, but the place did fill up in short order. From what I could overhear from the interaction with the owner, it seemed like many of them were regulars, which was reassuring. After all, if those people keep coming back, they must be doing something right!   Service was pleasant and not overly pretentious, just a tad slow at times. Yes, there could have been more smiles or slightly faster service, but it was a one person operation for much of the time I was there (it seemed like other servers showed up later?) so I can sympathize to a degree, at least.   As to the food, I have to say, I was quite surprised. The appetizer, the imperial rolls, was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be ordering it again in the future, without a doubt! I could have eaten more, it was that good! For the lunch itself, I went with one of their specials, the soy mongolian beef dish. Having had mongolian beef at many an Asian restaurant in the last few years, I've been all over the spectrum from authentic and delicious to Americanized and bland, and was pleasantly surprised to find the soy version at Fresh Mint surpassed many of the better, real beef versions I'd had. This stuff was good, to the point where I probably wouldn't have been able to tell it was soy-based. Everything on the plate, all the garnishing, was extremely fresh and the sauce was absolutely perfect, balancing everything out nicely.   I would definitely go back, and often. The food was excellent, the atmosphere was quaint and unique, and, at least for lunch, the price was right. Highly recommended!",

I was telling my sister she needed to come try it with us so we decided to dine in last night! Worst mistake! Service is HORRIBLE.  I think it may have just been the owner who was taking orders, but he was slow, and very unfriendly.  I felt unwelcome the moment we sat down.  They also need to hire more cooks because the food took forever to come out.  My boyfriend actually got up TWICE to refill his own drink because our \"waiter\" never came back to ask if we needed more. Also paying was about a 15 minute process as well.    It was definitely a let down.  I might have returned here for the take out, but since the atmosphere was so unfriendly I think I'll just stay away from now on.    I'll stick with green and loving hut for dining out veg.",

It's not that I have anything against tofu, I just can't cook it myself to make it actually taste good. Now I don't have to. I'll just take the family to Fresh Mint and have their yummy tofu instead! Surprisingly, they are not limited to tofu. I had the Kung Pao with \"pretend\" beef......HOLY COW! It was freakin' good!!! I honestly don't know if I could have guessed it wasn't beef if you hadn't told me.   My husband had the Rainbow dish with \"pretend\" chicken. Again, wow! It actually tasted like good food.....good food that just happens to make your taste buds think they are eating chicken! His was a wee bit spicy for me, but infused with a great flavor nonetheless. The kids got a Pad Thai, and that was the only thing that was kind of bland. Whereas our other two dishes had AMAZING sauces, the Pad Thai could have used a little more \"umph\".   Oooohhhh, and the summer rolls (one of my favorite Vietnamese appetizers) had tofu instead of the shrimp that is normally served. I didn't even miss those delicious little guys. Good peanut sauce, great fresh veggies, and a choice between white and brown rice help this newer eatery get my 4 stars.   Now I know what to \"cook\" when my vegetarian father-in-law comes to town. We are dragging him to Fresh Mint!",

It was just cabbage in a rice paper roll.  I love that there are so many healthy, tasty options, but I must say the atmosphere is really lacking and reminded me of a kid's playroom with the fluorescent green walls and the giant purple mint leave on the wall.

    "text": "OMG my first review!  I've been trying to cut meat out of my diet lately, and I keep driving by this place on the way to and from work.  When I finally made it there, I was slightly surprised by what I found.  The ambiance is somewhat odd, and not in the \"odd but quirky and cool\" sense you get from other vegan restaurants.  It's got kind of a strip mall chic feel to it, and the fifties music playing in the background made me feel like I got dropped in some bizarro \"Back to the Future\" scene, but the food was great and the couple that owns the place was really friendly!  I went on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one there--the place was dead.  It gave me pause at first, but the appetizer I ordered (Fried Imperial Rolls) was excellent, although the portions were small.  The vegetarian dipping sauce (whatever that is) was especially good.  For my meal I ordered Golden Soy Chicken--and although it looked like the same rubbery soy chicken substitute you might buy at the grocery store, it actually tasted like chicken!  The scrumptious citrusy ginger flavor of the sauce really made the dish, though.  The veggies seemed a bit more for garnish than for actual consumption, but they were ok, too.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5?  You pay too much for the size portions you get.  I had an appetizer and an entree and I still left not quite full.  I'm thinking I'll have to try this place for lunch sometime, since I work only right down the road.",

You definitely get a mix of great cooked food or ok bland, and I'm not sure if it's what you order, or who's cooking, or maybe when you go, but they are a bit inconsistent.  When it's on, it's great.  The service IS a little funny, and since it's such a small place, you have to deal with a personality.  Just roll with it... service is always good when someone means well!   I still go regularly, but always with a \"we'll see what we get\" feeling.  It's never bad, so I disagree with the 1star review.  And there are SO few choices in Scottsdale, so take what you get or cook at home.  I would absolutely recommend that you try it for yourself, get a few different things and you'll enjoy.",

We started with the Lotus Salad (lotus root,carrots, cabbage, etc. lots of crunch) which was to die for! The flavors were spot on and the colors in the dish were nice and vibrant. I ordered a spicy lemongrass soup with noodles and tofu and the little woman ordered a mock-beef lemongrass noodle entree, both of which were superb.  The only reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is because the dessert was kind of a bust.  We ordered one slice of carrot cake and a slice of chocolate cake.  They ended up being out of the carrot cake, totally not a big deal (even though my heart was a little broken over it) so we ordered 2 slices of the chocolate cake.  They were rather huge and looked tasty, but the cake itself was suuuuper dry, almost like I was chewing on...well something not soft.  I worked in a vegan restaurant back in the day and have totally had soft and moist vegan cakes.  The cake had many layers that were filled with frosting and fruit fillings. I felt like it kind of lacked flavor and I think they can do better.  I wouldn't get the cake again, but the rest of the meal was fantastic and the service was good, too.",

Chakra is still my favorite but they have such limited hours that I never get the chance to eat there. Fresh mint is amazing and their hours are much better but it's still very far from where I live, but luckily close to where I live.   I agree with the consensus that their Kung Pao Soy Chicken is really good. In the future I'd really like to branch out and try some of their soups but I tend to stick with what works. The owner is usually there and helping the staff and he is really friendly and affable. Overall, fresh mint has an extensive menu, pretty reasonable prices and a nice interior. I hope they open more in the Central Phoenix area in the future!",

The salad had a very light and flavorful citrus dressing, walnuts, cranberries, apples, etc...   I wish the portion was a little larger for $9, but it was very tasty.    The pad thai had nice fresh veggies and was very good, but the curry was much better.  It was a little spicy, which I like, and was very flavorful.  It wasn't a coconut milk curry (or had very little) so it was a little different from most Thai green curries I've had, but I loved it.   I definitely would go back to Fresh Mint.  The food was great and I like supporting family owned/operated restaurants, which are scarce in north Scottsdale!!",

    "text": "Keep in mind we drove here from Gilbert. When we arrived around 2:15 there was a piece of notebook paper on the door that said they were closed for lunch. I asked the man working when they'd be open and why they randomly closed because it didn't state it on their website. He told me that the workers were tired and they needed a break. He was not apologetic, sincere or friendly at all. It would've been one thing if he gave more of an explanation, but apparently we were just another dollar to him. We drove 45 minutes to get told they were closed for an unmarked lunch break and to be treated poorly. The food looks good on the website but there is equally as good food with much better customer service. Will never attempt to eat here again, there are plenty of other phenomenal restaurants that carry ALL vegan food along with impeccable service:  The loving hut The Green 24 carrots Pomegranate cafe",

We were excited to dine here as we're both a fan of mom and pop places.  We ordered the Thai Tea to drink which was interesting to say the least. Full of flavor but wayyyy too much sugar and coconut cream!   30 minutes into service we finally got our cucumber rolls. These don't need to be cooked... I could make them with my eyes closed. Not sure why they took 30 minutes but they were delicious! And the peanut sauce, ONE OF A KIND!   But then we waited another 30 minutes for our dinner to come out. I ordered pho and my bf ordered the imperial noodle dish. A few bites in and he ran to the restroom to heave.  The pho was OK. Nothing fancy. The fake beef was really gross.   We had his noodles taken off by the owner which was nice of him but In the end we both left with tummy aches.  One tip if the owners are reading this: You need more than 1 cook back there and maybe a waiter with a little more experience (the gentleman running the floor messed up a few orders around the restaurant and seemed very stressed)",

The lady on the phone told me it would take about 10 minutes. So I drove 15 minutes to the location to find that they never started on my order.. okay no big deal it's a pretty easy thing to prepare. Nope. I ended up being there for almost 30 minutes. While the staff argued back and forth about what my order actually was. It wasn't until the woman who took my order finally told them what it was. So after all that I received my order. Definitely not worth the 30ish minute wait. Food was okay. That's it. Nothing special. Portions were not that great for the 15 bucks I paid.  Maybe it was a bad day not sure. But it wasn't really handled properly.   I might try it again. Not sure.",

I was told I wouldn't be disappointed and it's HIGHLY recommended.  Let me first say, it was 104 outside, the ground was hot and the air was hotter and this Northerner is considering getting soup and to continue melting? As scared as I was about the heat on heat bidness, I had to get it.  The flavors were on point. This may be in the upper end of the top 3 Asian Soups I've had.    The service was solid, the server was patient and provided great service. The place was clean, had a nice ambiance of a hidden mom n' pop spot and the prices were reasonable.  5 stars.

Everything they have is so tasty and good for you, the restaurant is a nice type of small and the husband of the chef (aka the owners) is the server most of the time. (Speaking of the chef, she's Vietnamese and makes a killer Pho) But really, you can't go wrong with their menu, and their smoothies and coffee are so worth. Everything is fresh and cooked to order.  Even though no one cares, my personal favorite is their pad thai and vegetable spring rolls:)",

The cost was $11. The service was also just okay, even when trying to make conversation with the staff they seemed very indifferent. For the same price, I'll be driving to the west side and go to Loving Hut, which has way bigger portions for the same cost.",

The food was pretty outstanding, the portions aren't too big or too small, and the prices are fair. I ordered the pho soup and the Mongolian Soy beef. Don't hesitate to order their soy meats, they're the best that I've tried so far!   As for the service, our experience wasn't great. Our waiters weren't very friendly and the food took a good while to get to us. The manager later came up to us and apologized. It's a pretty small restaurant so expect slower service during the busy lunch and dinner hours. However, the quality of food in our opinion outweighed the poor service.   Overall would recommend to everyone, not just the vegan community!",

Also had the Rainbow Wonder. A colorful mix of grilled fresh veggies.  This restaurant is the future of dining! Every meal is cooked to order. The effort that goes into the preparation of each dish is rewarding.    The owners should be rewarded with expanding to multiple locations. We drove from Sun City West just to try this place . Well worth the drive but would love to see more locations some day.   The only other similar restaurant we can compare this to is Thai Vegan in Albuquerque New Mexico.  This IS the future of dining so go check out this wonderful restaurant.",

Service is not their strong suit, good food is. I wish I could give them all five stars, but it appears the owner takes care of everyone himself. When the place is a little full the service suffers a bit. He makes up for it with a pleasant demeanor and knowledge of the menu though so I'm not sure I would change a thing.  My favorite is the spring rolls. Great app or as a light entree. Any of the dishes on the menu are a home run though. Like I said, overall the place is great and I enjoy it.  Worth a visit, even if your not vegetarian. It definitely crosses over to all palates.",

It is seriously nothing more than a bagged salad. I also got the summer rolls.  Really fresh and yummy!  Light, too.

My friend order the Golden Soy Chicken and I had the Curry Veggies w/ tofu. We've eaten at Veggie House and we were impressed with their soy-meat fare but I was blown away with Fresh Mint. The soy-chicken dish was amazing, not a weird texture but just right. The sauce that goes with it was mighty tasty. My Curry Veggies were kickin!

I was pleasantly surpised with my choices...though i wished I ordered what my friend ordered.

The salad that comes with the lunch special, was simple but had amazing flavor, and they gave me the choice of brown or white rice. The lunch special cost me about $8.74 (including tax).   I hadn't really read any reviews on yelp or other sites, just looked at the star count on Urbanspoon. I decided to take a leap of faith on this place, and I was definitely NOT disappointed. Will be returning and trying some of their other dishes.  For right now, as it's what I had for lunch. I would definitely recommend the Golden Vegetable Curry. It's the right amount of food, without stuffing your stomach too full. I also feel like I made a good healthy decision by eating here instead of fast food, however, my order only took about 10 minutes to make (so still pretty damn fast).   One last thing, this place is vegan. They serve soy beef and soy chicken for some dishes, but there is no meat. I am giving them 4 stars for right now, as I have only tried one dish, but so far I'm impressed.",

The only thing I don't like about their food is their vegetables; they're just steamed.  No sauces, no light oil or lemon juice.  It's broccoli and some squash -- they're steamed perfectly but they just lack taste.  It's really a downer to get a great entree with such dismal vegetables.  And, since they're barely enough sauce with the meats you can't hardly dip the veggies in the sauce.  The service is really odd.  I don't know how else to describe it.  It's not bad service, but it really could use some polishing. I was there today and one gentleman was talking so loudly as he was working that you could hear him complaining about this or that.  He really could sharpen up his wait techniques and cut out about 50% of what comes out of his mouth.  I also can't get out of there in an hour.  I called in an order, was told about 10 minutes and didn't leave until nearly 40 minutes after I called in the order.  It was Valentine's Day but they weren't that busy.  But, I'll keep coming back because the main entree is always excellent (sans the sides).  I just wish the environment and service matched the prices.",

    "text": "I am breaking a personal rule and reviewing this after the first visit!  My housemates and I went and we ate half of the items listed on the menu, so it was like visiting several times.  We had imperial rolls for starters. Lemongrass soy beef noodles, papaya salad, hotpot, stuffed tomatoes.  Fresh Mint special lemonades for our drink.  Then we finished with mango tapioca and banana fritters.  After a debauched weekend, I thought this might be a good place to get back on track and eat a healthy, nice vegetarian meal.  As you can tell from what we ordered, the debauchery continued!  The imperial rolls were amazing for not having any meat in it!  No loss of flavor whatsoever.  I did notice a difference in texture, but it wasn't bothersome.    The papaya salad had to be one of the best dishes we ordered.  It had the right amount of crunch on the fruit.  The dressing was also well balanced and was not too spicy with chili, or salty with fish sauce or sour with lemon, and just the hint of sweetness.  The addition of Thai basil gave it a refreshing finish.  Just wondering though, if they used fish sauce at all...being vegetarian...hmmm.  My next favorite has to be the hotpot.  A super hot ceramic bowl filled with sizzling brown rice and vegetables with a sauce that just imparts flavor without being obnoxiously present.  The vegetables were not overcooked, the rice was starting to crust at the bottom and the sauce brought it all together.  You have to go and taste for yourself. It's really good.  At our visit, Fresh Mint was staffed by a father-daughter team, with daughter at the back of the house.  Dad, as the server, was friendly and inviting, and paid just the right amount of attention to us.  My rec is to go with friends who don't mind sharing, and order tons of food.",

    "text": "I went here on a whim last night, not knowing that it was a Vegan/vegetarian restaurant.  That being said, I was VERY impressed! The food was very fresh and tasty. I was a little apprehensive about eating the meat substitutes but came away happy.  I had the cucumber rolls and the Lemongrass soy beef delight. I was very pleased with both. The cucumber rolls were handmade right in front of my eyes, and they were beautiful, crunchy, and FRESH. The peanut sauce that they come with was also very tasty.  The LSBD was also very good, I really liked the taste and texture of the \"beef\"; it even had the proper looks of shaved beef. The noodles that they are served with were light, perfectly cooked and a great compliment to the rest of the dish.  I'll for sure be visiting again sometime soon!",

    "text": "As a vegetarian (but not vegan) I was psyched to go eat at a place where I wouldn't be limited to appetizers and/or eating off someone else's plate (or having to face idiotic comments like \"just pick the meat off.\") The menu was like a smorgasboard of love! Tofu everything! Sweet Lucy, what did I do to deserve this?   Fresh Mint, I so wanted to love you and hold you and call you my own. But I was denied.  I  had the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. It was pretty spicy for my taste, but that may just be because I am a wimp in that area. The decor was blindingly bright,  yet charming. But there were a few downs:  The service was slooooooww....especially for a lunch hour; the guy who served us had stains all over his shirt -- kind of like he'd just run a race or dripped beer on himself. I also saw him flip a tablecloth. Seriously. How gross is that?  I'll probably give it one more try, particularly since they now have $8 lunch specials. Oh, and they don't take American Express. Bummer.  Fresh Mint, I still have hope that someday -- you and I -- fireworks, long walks on the beach, champagne...don't let me down, baby!",

    "text": "Vegan should never mean bland, watery, under/over cooked.  Yet, that's what Fresh Mint stands for.  Our $32 lunch consisted of curried vegetables, steamed vegetable side dish, rice side dish and pad thai.  The curry was so watery and tasteless that it might as well have been yellow water.  The vegetables in the curry were overcooked to the point of being mush, and was mostly sweet potato with 2 small pieces of white potato and a sad showing of poorly done tofu.  The steamed vegetables my mom ordered came out raw, with a strange tasting peanut sauce on the side.  As to the Pad Thai, the noodles were overcooked mush, with no hint of actual Pad Thai taste.  And $4 for lemonade was just over the top.  Add to that the owner's effort to cut costs by keeping the AC turned to about 85, so we had a nice warm humid restaurant to dine in (mind you, it was 106 outside, so perhaps he thought 85 would be acceptable.).  Now, we have dined at some truly superb vegan restaurants around the country, including places like Zen Palate in NY, where not only was the presentation of the food spectacular, but the complexities of flavors and dishes made us wish we had room for more.  Fresh Mint doesn't even come close to anything but a poorly executed and presented vegetable side dish restaurant.  Save your palate and your wallet.  There are alternatives out there.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Phoenix for a conference and asked Yelp for help on a good vegetarian restaurant. We were not disappointed with Fresh Mint.  We started with the spring rolls (I think it was the Afghan rolls...can't quite remember) and they were better than average.  We shared two entrees. Pho and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken was astonishing good and just this dish will give this restaurant a 5-star rating in my book. It may be one of the top 5 dishes I've ever had at a restaurant.",

    "text": "Having heard many fantastic reviews, I was eager to make the 40 minute trek from Old Town to Fresh Mint for some delicious vegetarian food. However, after my experience, I can confidently say that I wouldn't come back to this restaurant even if it were 5 minutes away. To begin, the place was empty and our server was sitting at a table reading a book when we walked in. She seemed peeved that we were there, and dropped the menus on the table without a single greeting. After taking our order (pad thai and colorful vegetables) she went behind the counter and played on her phone for the entire duration of our visit. Not fantastic service. In terms of the food: The sauce in both dishes was too sweet to eat, and the food was just bland and lacked flavor. I had to yell across the restaurant to get my server's attention for sriacha, and when she brought it to the table, there was only a teaspoon of sriacha in the ramekin. Now, I frequent many restaurants and I myself work in the industry, so I know what good food and good service is. Fresh Mint lacked in both of these areas. It's a shame.",

    "text": "As a long-time vegetarian (though not vegan at the moment), I was excited to try Fresh Mint.  I wasn't disappointed, although there are some minor things to note that others might find disappointing.  It was a tad pricey at $36.50 (before tip) for me and my 2-year-old, but to be fair, we did take home quite a bit.  If I could give 4.5 stars, I would.    The decor is bright, and it's quite small inside, but comfortable.  We got there early (about 4:30 on a Saturday), and were outnumbered about 4-1 by staff, but it started to fill up by the time we left.  The server brought my son a little stuffed toy, which I thought was a really nice touch.  I'm not sure this always happens, but it was nice nonetheless.  We started out with the cucumber rolls, which were excellent and reasonably priced at $5.95.  My son ate all the tofu out of them, but they were tasty regardless, and the peanut sauce was fantastic.  Next we had the veggie pho, and the small portion at $5.95 was more than generous.  I can't imagine how much you get with the large portion.  The broth was delicious, and the only downside (in my opinion) was that the veggie \"beef\" pieces were quite large and not bite-sized.  Next we shared the citrus ginger \"spare ribs,\" and although I'm not sure why they call them spare ribs (the pieces are chopped up like a stir-fry), the sauce was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  For non-veggies out there, a guy at a table next to us ordered the same dish and had to verify that it was veggie because he thought the texture was too \"real\" not to be meat.  It came with a choice of jasmine or brown rice, and I chose brown.  The rice was a little dry, but not bad.  The only complaints I have about this portion of the meal are that at $13.95, it's a little pricey, and the \"assorted vegetables\" that came with it were quite large.  There wasn't a knife in the table setting, so I had to break the broccoli and cauliflower apart with my hands.  I ordered hot coffee, which was served with a type of metal strainer over the cup that brewed the coffee right at the table (pardon my ignorance, but I've never seen this before).  The coffee tasted great, but took a while to \"brew\" and the only way to get a refill is to have them pour more water into the same vessel, which means you have to wait for it to brew again.  Like I said, it tasted great, but for coffee-holics like my boyfriend, who can drink a pot to himself in one meal, the wait might be annoying.  After dinner we enjoyed the chocolate cake, which I have to say I have serious doubts was vegan.  The server insisted that everything was vegan, but the menu specifically says \"vegetarian,\" not \"vegan,\" and I wonder if she actually knew the difference...???  The cake was moist and decadent, and as I'm not vegan, it didn't bother me one way or another, but if you're a strict vegan, I'd steer clear of that particular dessert just in case.  It was $5.95 and a huge portion.  Overall, the service was attentive (contrary to other reviews I've read), and our visit was really nice.  On a side note, the bathrooms do not have baby changing tables, which can be a drag if you have an infant, so just be prepared.  We'll definitely be back!",
