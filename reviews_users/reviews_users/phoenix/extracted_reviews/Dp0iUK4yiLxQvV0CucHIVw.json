Choose a base, sauce, meat, and four additional mix in's. The amount of food you get in one bowl will most likely leave you with leftovers as well. There is also an amazing promotional deal ($8 for $20) so take advantage of the greatness while you can. Will be back, despite the drive from over in Ahwatukee Foothills.",

I would get it again.\" I got the Chopped Chicken Salad, with extra mix-ins, and I still have enough for dinner tonight. It was good! Big chunks of grilled chicken, a number of different mix-ins, multiple lettuce options, and multiple dressing options. The staff was really nice. The girl who made my salad could tell I had never been in before - and was very patient when I couldn't decide what I wanted. I would definitely come back to try something else. The price was very decent for the size salad I got (2 meals worth) and a drink. The missing .25 star is because there weren't a variety of soda-size options (I like to get a large at lunch so it lasts me the rest of the day at work) - there was only one size - or soda options (but they had Diet Coke, so I'll be fine). Maybe next time I'll try one of the giant, yummy-looking cookies they had at the register.",

They have great reviews on Yelp. It was our first time in, and we were both overwhelmed from the options. Good thing they were patient with us, and explained the process. I ended up ordering a hot bowl: paneer, noodles, thai peanut sauce, corn, mushrooms, squash, bacon bits, avocado, & cilantro. We had $20 to spend so we splurged on avocado and bacon bits and glad we did, the bacon was flavorful with my noodles! I've had better paneer but the Thai peanut sauce is pretty good, and I would definitely come back since it's close to Pokitrition, where I work! Hot bowls are $7.95 super affordable. I'll probably ask for less sauce the next time I come in, mine was a bit saucy for my taste.",

This is similar to a YCs Mongolian BBQ in that you pick your own toppings and sauce combination, with the option of a rice or noodle bowl, or a salad. The people were very nice and helpful, and I liked being able to choose my own toppings to create a dish.   I got a rice bowl with chicken and veggies, and I was happy with the sauce they recommended. The portions were a little smaller than expected, but it was enough to fill me up. The Yelp deal was a great value and I think that I would end up there more often if there was one closer to me.

I am particular that my food doesn't touch meat and seeing my food being cook fresh in front of you is big plus. Also the food is served steaming hot right out of stove.   The only minus is hot food is served on plastic bowl, it would be good if they use China bowls.",

I thought the balance of all ingredients was very good, just enough of everything and a great taste. The tofu was not fried which I appreciate and it was not overly saucy. The vegetables were cooked to the right tenderness too!   Overall I would suggest this as a quick and relatively healthy lunch spot great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.",

Customize your Hot Bowl, Panini, Salad or Wrap with an abundance of fresh veggie options.  The space is sparsely decorated, but lends itself to a clean, neat appearance.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I'm not sure if something has changed since the time other reviewers posted, but the portion sizes were ample, not small, as others felt.  I will say I expected the Steak Hot Bowl might include Asian style noodles, but they seemed more like spaghetti.  The Chicken Panini was good, but could have used a little more flavor...maybe something as simple as a little salt.  The quality of the meats was adequate for the quick serve price point, though I'd be happy to pay a little more to kick it up a notch.  Overall, I'm happy with Fresh Millions.  A few little tweaks and this concept can go from good to great!",

    "text": "This would have gotten a 3 if they hadn't cheaped out for $1.50. I had purchased a Yelp deal for $8, to get $20 worth of food before heading over to try this place for the first time. The purchase of the coupon worked flawlessly. The \"use\" of the coupon... not so much. So, since the app wouldn't open my coupon, I decided to use their \"check-in\" offer instead, which offers either a Hot Bowl, Panini or Salad for free. The guy that was originally helping me, when the coupon was not working, and I left for a moment to see if there was a # to call... was busy with someone else... so a different guy was ringing me up. I told him I would just use the check-in offer instead for the Hot Bowl. I quickly just picked one of the 3 options that were available for free with the offer. Then, the other guy comes over his shoulder and asks about the coupon... I told him it wasn't working, so I'll just use the check-in offer. He then quietly tells the guy ringing me up, to take the panini off instead of the hot bowl. In my mind, I kind of thought he was trying to give me a better offer, thinking the paninis must be worth more... then, I thought I would look, out of curiosity. Nope... he made the switch to save $1.50 for the STORE. Omg, terrible customer service! That is ridiculous. Especially when he knows I blew money on a coupon that wasn't working. He says at the end... maybe you call call them and get your money back. I guess he hopes no one uses the offer! (So why offer it?!?)   The food was \"okay\".  I'd be more excited if the food was organic.   The beginning of my order was painful as well. First time, and the menu has tons of mix and match kind of options. He wasn't very helpful with making suggestions, or explaining how it all worked.   The second guy that was ringing me up was polite, and seemed less focused on greed. But, clearly he takes orders from guy #1. He was very friendly too... he thanked us for coming at the end, and told us to have a nice day. He gets 5 stars! ;)   ... maybe since he (guy #1) likes 1's so much, I should have given him a 1 star review?   Okay... I'll stop ;)",

The fresh standard they have for their ingredients makes the food they prepare taste amazing. I love the hot bowls and how they are immidiatly wok cooked. Highly suggest making this place a lunch time stop.",

One note - the owners of the chain may want to invest in some better photography, decor, design, etc.  There is nothing appealing about any of it - nothing to draw you in.  And unfortunately the name too doesn't really tell you much about the place.  \"Fresh Choice\", \"Fresh n' Fast\", \"Greens & Grains\" - literally anything that you can come up with on that basic theme would be a better name.  Regardless I will go back, and the suggestions I'm making are only to make it more appealing to a wider audience.",

(lunch) I got hot bowl chicken, noodles (yellow egg noodles), teriyaki, and toppings of baby corn, bean sprouts, carrots, tofu, and added broccoli (extra $0.50, not bad for portion added!)  (lunch) My friend got hot bowl shrimp, pasta (rotini), and I think it was a southwest kind of sauce (slightly spicy), with toppings.  I tried some of my friends dish and likewise, and we both liked mine better.  The teriyaki sauce was not too heavy and good, but not as good as some other teriyaki sauces I've tried.  The tofu tasted a bit bitter, and the baby corn was a bit off, so they might've benefited from being fresher (to not effect the overall taste).  Food came out quickly and good portions.",

I ordered a kids veggies and pasta for my baby and food for me and my toddler as well, went to pay, and by the time I got back to my table where my baby was already set up in his high chair, his pasta was in front of him. But here's where it gets crazy, the girl came to our table, saw that my baby's pasta had chicken in it (I didn't ask for it), she said you didn't pay for the chicken and TOOK IT AWAY. And my baby started screaming!! Who takes food from a baby??? They take 5 mins to bring him back his pasta with now no chicken. Side note: I used a yelp deal and was well over $1.50 under the amount of my coupon which would covered the chicken. I expressed my frustration and they didn't even respond. THE worst customer service I have ever ever ever had.  Sadly, I left out another part when I was ordering. I asked my toddler if he wanted chicken and rice or grilled cheese and he said grilled cheese. 1 min later while I'm still ordering, he said \"mom I want chicken and rice!\" So I ask the guy to change it and he says no, It's already being made!!! This has never happened to me ever!!! They are always willing to change!  The food was good, but the customer service was so upsetting and bad that I won't step foot in there again.",

    "text": "2.5 stars, but not for lack of tastiness.  Met aunt and her grand-daughter-in-law (?) here for a late dinner.  (Eating at 9:30 pm is WAY too late for me, but I haven't seen my aunt in ages, plus I'd just left a very fun and delicious chocolate Yelp event that had gone an hour past the event end time, so I justified my eating late by meeting family at a veggie-friendly place!)  Aunt told me that her relative w/ gluten-free dining restrictions would be joining us, so I had them choose between Fresh Millions and Thailicious-- the young woman chose FM.    My food was already on the table by the time I'd arrived, since they'd arrived at the restaurant ten minutes before closing, and I was still on my way from N. Scottsdale; My aunt relayed my phone order to the cashier.  If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  FM shares a corner lot with Subway, and it seems that it was designed by the same architect/company.  I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that it is a sister company of Subway.  I hope it isn't, as I DISLIKE everything Subway offers (artificial ingredients in their \"breads,\" GMO-everything, as well as corn syrup in their dressings, which are used in their salads and sandwiches).    I can see why FM is popular, especially among those of us who have diet restrictions, for there are so many ways to custom-order your food!  I chose a hot bowl, which comes with your choice of:  1. Protein- chicken, steak, shrimp, bacon, two eggs, tofu, or veggie  2. Sauce- Gluten-free options (Alfredo, basil pesto, chipotle southwest, Szechuan, & Thai peanut) and teriyaki, sweet & spicy, sesame soy & chili, Thai green curry, & tikka masala  3. Base- Brown or white rice, noodles, pasta, Romaine, spinach, or half & half of two bases  4. Four regular- as opposed to premium, which I assume cost more- mix-ins from a list of thirty-one (yes, 31!) ingredients  My steak hot bowl, with fusilli pasta and spinach bases, basil pesto sauce, and water chestnuts, bean sprouts, broccoli, and black beans, was hot, fresh, and tasty! <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fresh-millions-restaurant-chandler?select=tlJsqwFf3CMbkvsS7awPkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fres...</a>  I couldn't stop eating it.  However, I won't be ordering from Fresh Millions again, because something in this dish made my lips, tongue, and the insides of my mouth itchy!  Allergic reaction, but from which ingredient?  It may have been the water chestnuts, which I'm still experimenting with to see if I'm allergic, or perhaps one, or more ingredients weren't washed as clean as they could've been, the sauce ingredients, or just from all the pesticides that GMO products contain.  Eat here if you aren't sensitive to pesticides and GMO products, or if you don't mind suffering from food allergies.  I know which foods I'm willing to suffer for a day, or three, and which aren't worth the pain.  (Believe me, once you listen to what your body tells you, you will feel, look, and think better!)  Cool dining option for those who do not have food allergies, as there are also salads, wraps, and sandwiches you may customize and have fun with.  I liked the fact that the food are placed in reusable plastic containers and NOT styrofoam!  That's a plus worthy of 3 stars.",

For $21 we had a rice bowl, panini, drink, and two bags of chips. Now in my opinion this restaurant was a little lack luster. The panini was dry and way to much bread. The cheese was not melted and there was very little meat. The rice bowl did not look \"fresh\" at all. Instead it mostly looked like slop.  I am really concerned about the storage of their salads. Although in a cooler the salad was in open bins that had condiments and random items stored above. I was too grossed out to even imagine ordering a salad because of the risk of having contaminated items falling from above.",

I always get the hot bowl but wish they would go heavier on the veggies and meats. I always get 2x meat because there isn't quite enough. The tikka masala or Thai green curry sauce are my favorites. The problem is, even if you ask for extra salt they are so bland that you have to add salt to practically every bite. Would be nice if they had salt packets to go. That's my only complaint.   Give it a try. I think it takes most people 2 or 3 visits to really get the hang of it and figure out how best to order.",

Previously I've had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and Design Your Own Salad, and they've all been quite good!  Cost: $8.64, tax included, seems like a decent value. And unlike my first visit many months ago, the portion sizes have been generous - no complaints.  Service:  Staff is friendly and helpful, and I never have to wait long for my food.  Atmosphere: Well, it's clean. But it's very unassuming, much like the Subway next door.  Overall: I like the variety, and everything so far has been fresh and good.",

Total came to $9 and the wait was around 6-10 minutes.   Crew was incredibly friendly and asked the right questions and patient answering questions too. The bowl was hefty and smelled heavenly!!!!   Only disappointment was that there were only 4 shrimp in the bowl. For the cost the filler was carrots and carb. The Thai curry sauce was delicious and had a great kick!  Amex friendly",

I had the soy/chili sauce which had just the right kick!  The sauce was light and not overwhelming like a lot of places do which was a plus! The veggies cooked well and the entire bowl portion was a good size! I felt like I got my money's worth easily... it was fresh and yummy!  Will definitely be back to try the sandwiches (Which I saw them making and they looked awesome!)  Nice to have a \"fresh\" new choice in the neighborhood!",

The employee behind the counter did not help even though I asked for it and there were no other customers except my party of four. In addition, he did not let us use both Groupons even though they came from two different accounts.  I paid first. Then the next person in my party(of four) tried to use his and was refused. The manager was called and the manager said \"no\"... I called Groupon and Groupon refunded the unused Groupon. The food was too salty and mediocre at best . I would not come back and surmise that this establishment will close its doors when their rental contract expires.  We stayed inside to eat our food during a high peak lunch hour and only two other parties showed within 20 minutes.",

You choose a base such as noddles, pasta, spinach, romaine etc and then choose a meat, a sauce and 4 mix ins. Even my kids would like this place. Got a group deal from the yelp app that was $20 worth of food for $8. Our total with that came to 3 and some change so we spent less than $12 on lunch for the two of us. By checking in on yelp I received a free bowl on my next visit. I don't live near this place but if I am ever in the area again I will return.",

    "text": "Thanks Yelpers for another great recommendation! This might be my longest review I've ever written...  First I have to say... I hope the owners read this review. The gentleman that worked this evening named Alex was the best. He was so courteous, extremely helpful and everything an employee in a restaurant should be. So THANK YOU and keep Alex around... You will have repeat customers coming in with his great service.  Ambience: We walked in and it was dead (8pm). Almost thought it was closed. Alex was mopping and immediately stopped once we came in which I thought was kind of him to do. We walked up to the fresh food assembly line and he made it a point to ask me to hold on a moment so he can wash his hands. The sink is right in view. My OCD self was so relieved when he did that. This. Place. Is. CLEAN. And orderly. I was thinking that other restaurants need to take some pointers from these guys. I could probably eat off the counters and not have any issue. I would never do that but ya know what I mean. And based on the other reviews, I didn't just catch them on a good day, this is how it always is and seeing this solidified the other Yelpers reviews.  Food: I am not very adventurous of an eater so I was a little apprehensive trying a new menu. Alex walked me through it all even let me sample the sauces. I didn't feel rushed or that I was a bother, it was a great experience and made me happy for choosing to eat here tonight.  I ordered the chicken hot bowl with half noodles half rice with shredded carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts, and zucchini. Topped with some green onions and their sweet and spicy sauce - not too spicy either! It tasted so good, not greasy or loaded with MSG. It was DELISH. A big serving too so I can have left overs for lunch. I would say that the taste was familiar to me. It was a good mixture between Pei Wei and YCs Mongolian Grill in comparison. The great thing also is that the menu can go a little eccentric if you'd like. I think I'd attempt the Italian sauce next time when I feel like living on the edge... :)  Cost: Not bad - don't forget to use the Yelp deal while it lasts. When that's over, a bowl is under $9 after tax. I would definitely spend $10 here any day.   In summary, if you're down for a hot noodle bowl with some FRESH veggies and chicken this place is where it's at. You won't be disappointed!",

Everything is fresh and made on the spot for you, for reasonable prices.  I had a chicken tikka masala panini ($6) with a Caesar side salad ($1.80). I got the order to go, and it didn't take too long to be made. I was out the door in no time.  The sandwich had a crisp outer grilled crust, with fluffy, light tasting bread. There were big chunks of chicken breast in it, and the sauce was like the memory of chicken tikka masala sauce, a milder version rather than the bold spicy tomato-y cream sauce I'm typically used to. The salad was refreshing and crisp, and the dressing was flavorful.  Service was friendly. I'll come here again for tasty and quick meals if I'm in the area.",

Seriously, these bowls are so good! It's a lot of food for a decent price (under $9) and, better yet, it's healthy!  This is quickly becoming one of my \"go-to\" places for quick and healthy food!",

The first couple of times we went, I was pretty impressed with Hot Bowls. They offer a few different protein choices for these bowls including chicken, steak, shrimp, bacon, eggs, & tofu with a few sauce options ranging from teriyaki, sweet & spicy, alfredo, chipotle, & more. Your choices are served with veggie mix-ins on the base of your choice of noodles, rice, pasta, spinach, or romaine.  I've tried out the Chicken Hot Bowl with the Szechuan sauce, Teriyaki Sauce, & Tikka Masala sauce + veggies & either rice or noodles. My only qualm is that they're a little inconsistent. Once I had a bowl with the perfect amount of sauce & the veggies were cooked perfectly, but the other times there was way too much sauce & the veggies were not cooked for enough time.  I haven't tried out the other options here, but my fiance ordered a panini sandwich a couple of times. Neither of them were anything to write home about but still okay. I'd say that if you're looking for a quick option then this place is okay, I probably wouldn't put it on my list of places to go back anytime soon, however.",

Certainly nothing special that would make me want to come back.  However we will not be back. During our half hour of sitting in the restaurant every single checkout that a customer had was an ordeal where they were trying to nickel and dime them. The restaurant is clearly penny wise and dollar poor, and I don't suspect that they will survive. I have great doubts that any customer who came will be back based on their universal negative experience with the employees, wanting to charge extra for a sauce or a pinch of cilantro.   At the time we went there are all kinds of promotions to try to generate traffic including Groupon and yelp 50%+ discounts. With good customer service and an atmosphere that doesn't feel cheap and nickel-and-dime for every little thing we would be back, and I'm sure many others would be too. However, I'm pretty sure that Millions will shortly be out of business, and that's sad because it's a good idea.",

I was looking for a healthy option for lunch (new me I guess for 2017 :-). Saw a few things on the outdoor sign that peaked our interest so let's order!!!  I wanted something hot and the 1st thing that jumped out to me was the Shrimp & Avocado Panini. I complimented it with a simple side salad. The one thing I like were all the fresh ingredients and the ability to actually \"SEE\" it all directly in front of me. The selection was great but a bit overwhelming as a lot of the menu items have a \"specific\" set of ingredients and I'm one who likes to deviate my orders... Adding avocado to the salad was extra $ but if looked good.   The bread for the Panini's is \"thick\" so from a carb perspective, watch out as the focaccia bread  was filling. Speaking of fillings, I think the amount of shrimp, avocado & other ingredients were good, but didn't match the size of the bread. Still good but lack a flavor punch that I think I was expecting due to other Panini experiences.   Coworker had the salad wrap and it was pretty decent in size. Plan to make a few more trips over the coming weeks to diversify my choices but it makes the cut for lunch for me.",

Not sure of what to order, I decided to go with the chicken bowl with veggies and sweet /spicy sauce.   When you walk up to order they ask you to choose a meat, four veggies, noodles or rice and a sauce. They have a great variety of sauces and veggies. Other than bowls they also offer wraps, paninis and much more. If you are in the area give this place a try it's very good.",

I was using the $8 for $20 deal from Yelp and as soon as I mentioned it the employee starting saying that I could not use it for take out. I had never intended to use it for take out and let her know that. She kept asking \"are you sure?\" and I kept telling her that I was in fact eating there. I felt very attacked and when I had some leftovers for my salad that I ate in the restaurant she rolled her eyes as she handed me a box. Not sure what I did to deserve that treatment but I will not be returning.",

We ordered a bowl without chicken for our 1 1/2 year old child, when we got our food the bowl had chicken in it,  even though we didn't order chicken. Luckily this didn't matter at all as we knew our child wouldn't eat the chicken anyway so we just accepted it. When the lady who took our order came by she saw that there was chicken in the child's bowl, she got angry and said we didn't pay chicken, to which we replied no we didn't but it's alright he won't eat the chicken - thinking that she was accepting it was their fault, but without saying another word the women snatched the bowl from our child as he was getting a bite!!!!! And walked back to the kitchen leaving our 1 1/2 year old screaming!! Who the freak does that!!??? Who takes a child's meal away from them? We were so stunned! We yelled at her what are you doing!? But she just walked back to the kitchen. We had to comfort him and try to figure out what to do next. Within a couple minutes she walked back out with a new bowl with no chicken... No \"sorry\" or anything, not an ounce of care in the world that she had literally just stolen the child's food away because of a small amount of chicken? I would have just handed her a $5 bill!!! Amazing... Absolutely amazing that people like this exist and we have to exist with them. Don't misunderstand, I wish I had an excuse for her, something like \"well our kids were being bad\" or something! But there truly was absolutely no excuse for being treated like that as a paying customer... Will never go back, that women is in the wrong industry.",

I usually get the exact same thing (beef and shrimp noodle bowl with szechuan sauce) because why mess with perfection? Today I finally branched out and got pesto pasta with bacon and shrimp. My god. Is it really messing with perfection to add additional perfection? Survey says: NO.  This is literally one of the best places I have ever eaten in my life, and I eat a lot of food at a lot of places. I'm even counting really fancy places. I have paid over $250 for a meal before, and I would still put Fresh Millions in my top ten places I've ever eaten in my whole life. If I could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of my life, it would be here. The selection really is in the millions, but the real kicker is that every option is also preposterously delicious. Unlimited choice doesn't matter if the choices suck, but it for damn sure matters when every choice is just another variation on ridiculously tasty fresh food at a reasonable price. I have eaten here at least 20 times now, and I live in Tucson. The past five times or so, I have gotten one meal to eat there and taken another home for the next day because it is so damn good.  It has gotten to the point where I might start making the drive up just for this food alone. I could write 10,000 words, but it still wouldn't be enough.  If you don't at least try this place when you're in the area, you are seriously missing out. Eat at Fresh Millions.",

I love the tikka masala, schezwan sauce based bowls. They mix up all this and heat it up for a bowl of deliciousness.   The food seems fresh, healthy and very filling.

    "text": "This was my first time at Fresh Millions so I was not familiar with the way they do things. They don't allow customers to create their own salad but rather have to select one of theirs and can only switch out the ingredients you don't want from their salad with what you want. So if a salad on the menu comes with tomatoes and cheese but you don't want those then they'll substitute those two ingredients but if you want more greens (anything in the salad bar) then they'll charge you $0.50 per ingredient. That adds up since most of their salads only have three greens. That's not much if you want a salad for a meal and not an appetizer or side. I added shrimp (four grilled shrimp for $1.50) which were good but the bulk of my salad was lettuce (see photos).   And they don't chop or cut everything small enough to put in your mouth without cutting it with a knife. I felt like I wasted $10 because my salad was mostly lettuce. They do nickel and dime you which is a turn off. I prefer to create my own salad with as many veg as I want without it costing more than $10 like they do it at Salata. Not a huge variety in the salad bar but it was decent quality (not wilted and tastes good).   The bowls are probably the thing to get here not the salad if you want a meal. The bowls looked good so next time I'll try one of those but not at this location. I felt the customer service and friendliness was lacking and I found it difficult to understand what was being said to me because the woman was soft spoken.",

    "text": "I've eaten here several times, but finally got around to writing a review. I usually get the chicken tikka masala panini, primarily because that's one item that stood out in the menu (for me at least), everything else seemed familiar to what I've had before. I loved it the first time I had it, and have continually gone back and ordered the same item. Today was the first time I ordered something along with the panini, and it was the chicken hot bowl (per the server's suggestion as it's their signature item) and liked it as well. Their portions are generous, and the food is fresh. The ambience is nice and quiet, and their generous yelp deals and cash back offers make this place even more worth it.",

Both of my coworkers loved their bowls which used thai green curry (spicy btw!), and the sesame soy/chili sauce. I ordered the paneer hot bowl with tikka masala sauce. I was less thrilled with my bowl due to lack of flavor sadly. It was cooked well however and had adequate stir fry \"flavor.\"  Overall, I'll definitely come back to Fresh Millions due to the price and quality of food. I think I will just steer clear of the paneer tikka masala hot bowl from now on and go with one of their other sauces.",

They actually had texture...unlike a lot of \"fast serve\" noodle restaurants where the noodles are like melting rubber in your mouth. The bowls are great portion sizes and there are several different types of bases (rice, noodles, etc, etc) and a huge selection of sauces to choose from....let alone all of the mix-ins you get to choose. Friendly staff, fast service, GREAT FOOD....overall highly recommended. Oh ya, it doesn't hurt that the restaurant is super clean and the staff goes through great lengths to keep everything sanitary...I asked for a packet of soy sauce and the guy washed his hands with soap and water just to hand me a little soy sauce packet. If that isnt \"A\" quality, I don't know what is!",

She was denied again which is why although I work within 2 miles of this place I will never eat there again. Chances are there will be another restaurant type business in this location soon anyways so I will give that one a try when the time comes.

A couple of coworkers got the Hot Bowls, which are also very generously sized. I was a little worried about the chipotle mayo overpowering the flavor of the chicken and avocado, but it was mild, and complimented the other flavors. The price was reasonable for the quantity of food. I got the panini, side salad and drink for $10.55.",

I ordered the chicken avocado panini and it was much larger than I expected. It very filling and I love the bread they use, I think its Armenian bread.  My son got a shrimp bowl and I thought they could have put a few more shrimp in there for the price, I think he only got 4-5.

My buddy dining with me for a bowl which is completely customizable with fresh veggies your choice of base (rice, salad, or a combo of 2)and meat.

With the options of Alfredo, pesto and curry sauces in addition to all the tasty Asian options ...it goes above and beyond - even our pickier kiddos are happy!  The restaurant is very clean...they are doing an awesome job of keeping up with it.  There are also sandwich options if that is your thing and some great salads.  The only thing that I would suggest they change is they do not have plastic knives. Strange!  It makes it difficult to cut up noodles for the kids or the large (yay!) shrimp they include.  Even if you have to ask for a knife, one should always be available.  I ended up using 2 forks to slice up the noodles but had to bite off the shrimp.  Last note - I'm surprised by some of the reviews that say the portion sizes are small because I thought they are spot on for both the adult and kid options.  If you are looking to gorge yourself on super sized options you can get McDonald's across the street.  The adult entree sizes are at least 16 oz of food which should be enough for any adult.  Try this place out! They have a $6 bowl option right now for their Grand Opening that is an awesome deal if you don't want to spend too much checking out a new place.",

We had the Steak Panini w/side salad and the Chicken Avocado Panini w/side salad as well.  The bread was very fresh and both were cooked and presented to perfection.  The cool thing about the side salad was that 'you' picked out what you wanted in it!!  Wonderful!!!!  Very simple, however, very fresh.  Overall bang for buck was well worth it.
