    "text": "I was skeptical about trying this place out, since lately I've been experiencing poor ramen restaurants in the valley. However, this place is a very good comparison to Tompopo Ramen. It took about 5-10 minutes to find this place, since their store sign was not lit so I assumed there was not a business there. Upon entering the place, it is small and quaint. They give you water in a vase cylinder along with stainless steel cups. I was quite impressed by this, when comparing to other restaurants that don't do the same. I ordered the Shio Ramen, typically I order Spicy Miso but I wanted to change it up a bit. The Shio Ramen tasted very tender, clean, and has a slight fish taste. When ordering, the waitress will ask about your level of spiciness and the type of egg you want for you ramen. The menu is simple and easy to understand with not many menu items, so the kitchen can focus on what they do best.  This place is definitely a must try whenever you are in the area.",

The broth was flavorful, the pork was super meaty and delicious, and the noodles had good texture. Prices are reasonable and the service was pretty quick. The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars is because their soft boiled egg was really cold in the soup. Not sure if that's how its supposed to be, but it was a little weird. Other then that, I'm really glad this place is in Phoenix and I will definitely return for some ramen!",

All at medium spice level. They were all decent but the Nishikawa Black had much stronger delicious flavors to me than the other bowls I've had so far.   The gyoza is decent and I do order it every time.  I've read minor complaints in other reviews about the 1 pork piece they have in the bowls of ramen. They are valid to me. Yes, it's a bit fatty and not packed with as much flavor as you're expecting. Yes, there's only 1 piece but I usually add an extra one for a small upcharge.  As someone else said, LA ramen is definitely better. However, this is still enjoyable and good enough for my ramen fix.  If you're not a ramen snob and are looking to try better ramen, go here. You will most likely enjoy it.",

Started with the Chicken Karaage which we enjoyed. It had a reasonable portion size for the price.  Heavily disappointed by the Spicy Tonkotsu, the broth had an obvious lack of flavor compared to any other ramen spot I've been to.  This was made up for by the Nishikawa Black which I would certainly come back for. Definitely recommend getting curved noodles, but the pork chashu was pretty average.   Overall, a nice little spot for ramen, particularly due to its low price point. Will need to make a trip to the Chandler location as well.",

    "text": "I was super bummed after our experience here. We walked in, sat. Got water right away. Sat for a while as it was decently busy... we had more than a desired amount of time to decide what we wanted while waiting for our server... 2 servers ran the floor, which you could see in its entirety from anywhere in the restaurant. We ordered everything together when our server came by. 3 apps, 2 beers and 3 ramens. (We wanted a bowl but they were out of rice) waited 15 minutes and got 1 of our apps... then the other 2 followed. Our beers finally came as 2 of the 3 ramens came. I assumed mine was following because the way everything else came out individually... our server never came back... I watched her stocking the cooler with soda and then stocking Togo containers and such. Multiple people came in for pickup orders but she never came back to our table... after my friends finished their meals we sat for an additional 15 minutes just waiting for our server to stop by but we noticed she was putting gloves on to go clean the bathroom. The other sever was cleaning a table near ours so I flagged her down (which is so annoying to do... it's so rude) I asked for the check as we were more than ready to go, I asked her to make sure that my ramen was not on there seeing as it never came and no one stopped by... you were all busy stocking for the night so I couldn't notify anyone... she said \"oh I'm sorry you should've flagged me down\".... hmmm maybe you should've stopped by seeing as your coworker was too busy with trying to leave... I never write reviews and this really bummed me out because I've been stoked to try this place... don't waste your time... just get takeout... Or honestly go to Sushiholic up the street (the service is awesome, the food rocks and the specials are killer)... The service here sucked which is lame because the ramen looked awesome. Moral of the story... skip it.",

    "text": "I'm a frequent visitor to the original Nishikawa location in Chandler...being addicted to the house Nishikawa Black Ramen. Today I ventured to the new central Phoenix location on a work outing. I must say that the quality didn't miss a beat. They pulled off the exact same high quality as always.  That being said, this place has earned my admiration and its time I take the time to honor them with my full opinion.  If you love Ramen or have never tried it (or only know of the instant packets--like me until I saw the Netflix Chef's Table episode on Ramen which put me on a mission to find a great place), just try this: go into Nishikawa (either here or their Chandler location), order the Nishikawa Black house soup and prepare yourself for an experience as good as the 20+ hour stewing broth and house-made noodles. The pork belly in the soup is melt-in-your mouth and I just love the soft-boiled eggs, the flavors are so deep and savory. The pot stickers are fantastic, served with some bright ponzu sauce. I also love the Takoyaki...fried-dough dumplings with octopus inside, covered in a sweet mayo sauce with shaved smoked fish. You will love these.  To sum it up, if there was a national competition of Ramen by city, let's say we'd want Nishikawa to be representing the Phoenix metro area. Tampopo in Tempe is a strong 2nd. But they are bit more expensive, lack a comfortable seating environment (you have to be in college to find it suitable) whereas Nishikawa offers comfort, and their overall Ramen flavor is a degree behind Nishikawa's (props to Tampopo for taking the time to make their own noodles in-house too and that is why they and Nishikawa tower above the other Ramen places around).",

The ramen, well I can't say enough, it was SO good! I had a spicy miso ramen which was delish! My friend had a mild miso and she loved it as well. The service was really great, our waitress was wonderful! The place fills up quick, which tells you how good it is! I will return to see what else is on the menu.

Very very tasty, and the choices are all worth trying, I've now tried 3 of their specialties, my favorite is definitely the curry. Do not be hesitant to experiment with different add ons!

I am a fan of the miso ramen, get your egg soft boiled.   Try the Katsu bowl. My kids love it. Juicy chicken cutlet, delightfully breaded over rice for about 6 bucks. It's a small portion perfect for the kids, or in the side with your soup.  Overall, the service is friendly and the couple of times I have been it has been average to above average. Last night was a little below average. Again, I want to talk service for a moment, food has been consistent and delicious.   It was a bit of a mess, it was 5:45 on a weekday and I was with a 3 year old. Two items that try your patience when going out.   We were the last party seated in a wave of folks arriving for dinner so I knew we were going to have to wait a little. Unfortunately it was a bit too much. 10 minutes to get out order taken, first the Katsu bowls showed up for the kids in about 10 minutes. Then our appetizer of edemame and finally, our soup. Overall we waited a solid 25 minutes from the time we ordered. Also, half our party was done with dinner by the time the rest of us even received ours. Not awesome.   It my opinion, they are just not staffed for the success they are having. If I'm not mistaken, 3 people ran the whole place, at the most 4! Two servers and a cook. I am no restauranteur but I don't think it is enough.   I estimate they were matching or exceeding their dining room guests with to-go guests. It seemed just too much for the staff on hand to take care of.    I don't want to burn the servers that were there either, they were doing pretty well for as busy as they were.   Niskikawa, I am going to give you 4 stars because I am going to rate all my experiences there in totality not just last night. Let's be clear, I want to have an awesome local Ramen place to enjoy but you are going to have to do better than this!  I will be back and hopefully will be able to keep those 4 stars.",

The service was straight to the point, efficient, and without a whiff of friendliness or appreciation for our business.   The presentation was as good as the uploaded pictures, but the flavors were fairly lackluster in contrast.   We started with chicken karaage and pork gyoza. The gyoza was crisped nicely and was very flavorful, especially with the dipping sauce. The karaage and accompanying sauce was tasty, but the chicken thighs were full of connective tissue.    We finished with a pork bowl [with thinly sliced pork belly], vegetarian ramen and a Nishikawa Black ramen. I was able to taste all three and can say that none of the dishes were interesting. The pork belly and pork in the ramen carried some flavor, but the vegetarian and pork broths were bland and did not stick to the noodles like a full-bodied broth should. The noodles, however, were pleasingly chewy. I haven't had a ton of ramen broths in my life, but this stuff placed at the bottom of my list. To give you a sense of what I consider good pork broth, try making David Chang's pork ramen broth recipe. Maybe that's asking too much.   Again, we're probably not going to give this place a second try.",

    "text": "Yes!!! I have found my ramen place. I've been to nishikawa 4 or 5 times since it opened in Phoenix (yay to that), and I have figured out the perfect ramen order. I get tonkatsu with the egg soft, extra spicy, add black garlic oil and it is sooooo legit! The prices are a little on the high side, but I always get two meals out of one bowl, so that's not so bad. The ramen here has amazingly flavorful broth and the meat is always extremely tender. The space is somewhat small, but I've never had to wait. This is my go to ramen place, check it out and it may be yours as well!  Ps: 1900!",

I love that they place the seaweed along the back of the bowl - both lovely and delish.  The only negative we had was that we also ordered the takoyaki for an appetizer. My friend had never had takoyaki and I really enjoyed mine at the Phoenix Night Market, so when our order was delivered, we dove in. Unfortunately, they were really cold in the middle. We alerted the server and decided against a replacement and they took it off the bill. This was not long after they had first opened their doors, so I'm hoping it was just a glitch in the matrix.   High quality ramen, high quality service. Can't wait to go again!",

    "text": "I came here on a very rainy, chilly day (which is unusual for an October day in Phoenix) so it was definitely a perfect time for ramen. I've had my fair share of disappointments with ramen in the Phoenix metro area, but I would say that I've finally found a pretty solid place. You know it's a good sign when the restaurant is full, even on a day where there were flash flood warnings everywhere. However, the wait was still reasonable (under 10 minutes) despite the initial 30 minute estimate. Service was average - speedy, but the servers seemed a little rushed and flustered.  The food was pretty darn good and hit the spot. We started the meal with the char siu bowl, which came with one piece of char siu over a bed of rice. It was good and well seasoned, but personally, this is one I'd skip especially if you're getting a bowl of ramen that comes with it anyway. So, I ordered the curry ramen while the wife had the tonkatsu. Both were tasty, although we both agreed that the curry was slightly better. Both ramen came with a big piece of char siu, a sheet of seaweed, and your choice of hard or soft boiled egg. I went with the soft boiled, and the yolk was cooked to perfection. Not too runny and not too overdone either. I enjoyed the noodles themselves as well - there was just enough firmness and kept its texture throughout the meal without being soggy. For Phoenix standards, this ramen is solid considering this isn't exactly a hotbed for Japanese food and culture.",

We came about an hour before close and got seated very quickly. We had all of our questions about the menu answered and a large container of water and glasses were brought instantly to the table.   My roomie ordered edamame and one of the bowls and I ordered the kishikawa black ramen. When her bowl came out, it was shockingly small. I don't know if it came in a larger size or not but she was confused as to why it was so small and she was thankful that she ordered the edamame to help fill her up. We originally thought the bowl that came out was just the meat and veggies and that another bowl of rice was going to follow but nope it was all in there. I tried a little bit of her bowl and the meat was tender, had really good flavor, and wasn't overly salted. The edamame was pretty spicy which we liked. My ramen was good. I ordered it with a soft boiled egg and the egg was cooked perfectly. The broth was spicy and a little on the salty side but I actually enjoyed it a little saltier. In the ramen, they had sliced mushroom  and bamboo shoots as well as ground pork and pork chashu. I wish there were more crunchy components to the ramen. It had dried onion and dried seaweed but both of those get water logged with in a few seconds of being in the bowl.  Overall, it was a good dish though and it definitely hit the spot.",

We got the curvy noodles, which are thicker, chewier and in my opinion much better than the skinny straight noodles. I thought this was the best Ramen place in Phoenix. Definitely worth a visit.

The food was so good here that we drive all the way from Goodyear to eat here when we need our fix. Their Tonkatsu Black bowl with mild spice and straight noodles is to die for and their soft boiled eggs are some of the best we have ever had. Also really enjoy the gyoza here.

I don't consider myself a Ramen expert -- but I've had it from about half a dozen japanese restaurants. What I was disappointed with was the lack of traditional japanese ingredients. No seasoned bamboo, no bean sprouts or carrots, no spicy miso paste, no pickled red ginger. Very basic ingredients here -- just some green onion and mushroom strips. Finally, and probably most important, the egg was whole, overcooked and completely hard boiled -- not soft boiled and cut in half as it should be in Ramen.",

If you're looking for something unique to try, keep the appetizers in mind.   Next, the ramen. There are a variety of ramen to choose from, with different broths, noodles, toppings, and fun add-ons.

The service was quick, waters were brought out immediately, which is almost never a thing in any restaurant I've ever been to. The ramen itself was EXCELLENT. I am a vegetarian so I tried the veggie ramen and my bf picked the pork belly ramen, he said it was the best thing he's ever eaten.

Food: Miso ramen: Pork broth, pork chashu, green onions, menma, Seasoned egg, curved noodles.  Spicy level is spicy (hottest they do). Pretty good ramen thus far that I have been to in phoenix.  They actually have the spiciness in the broth/ramen and not some chili flake add-on or hot sauce on the side type of deal. So off to good start.  Definitely preferred the CURVED noodle instead of the straight, just has more to it.  Overall broth had flavor and was good.  Perfect amount of food for \"regular hungry.\" You can always add noodles for like $2. So reasonable.   Downsides:  1. They forgot the egg (but they gave it on the side after we told them).  2. only 1 slice of chashu, (you can add on for additional price.) But I was expecting at least 2 slices or something. But the Chashu was done nicely. One of the better ones in phoenix.   Price:  $9.45 + tax for Miso ramen. Not too bad for ramen price.   Service: Friendly and fast. They did forget to put soft boil egg in both of our orders, which was weird as the egg wasn't an additional topping. It was included in the original ramen order. They promptly brought out both eggs on the side after we told them.   Parking: lot outside. no issue.  Environment: Medium size restaurant. More accommodating to smaller groups, more tables for 2.  Clean. Kitchen is open, so you can see what is going on.",

If you like your soup with a little kick in it, ask for it spicy....trust me on this one ;)  Nishikawa Ramen has definitely earned a spot in my weekly takeout rotation. If you like ramen, you 100% HAVE to check this place out!",

I've been to the Chandler location once and have been wanting to come back, but it's a far drive so I haven't had the chance to and now I don't have to anymore. Wooo!  This is pretty close to work for me so I went for a quick lunch on their first week ish of opening. I had the chicken karage and miso ramen. Both were as yummy as I remember from 9 months ago when I tried it in their Chandler location. The broth was delicious and the soft-boiled egg and pork chashu were perfect.   I'll definitely be back. This is still the best ramen I've had in Phoenix so far.",

Had the Pork Gyozas and Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl.  The Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl consist of Pork broth, pork chashu, green onion, kikurage, seasoned egg, fish powder, sesame served with straight noodles and a hard-boiled egg. Very good ramen bowl with a nice tasting broth which is about the most important thing about the ramen to me.  The Pork Gyozas are made up of pork and veggies served with ponzu sauce. Love how they make one side crisp and just perfectly cooked.  This location is very modern and just opened recently, I kind of like the Chandler location charm and think the food there is a little better there than the new location.",

It came with the option of a soft or hard boiled egg. You can also order it with mild, medium, or hot spice. I got mine mild.   The ramen came out fast. The soup was creamy and I love having corn in my ramen. There was a little too much green onion for my liking. But overall, a great bowl of ramen for the price.   They give a carafe of water so you can refill on your own. I prefer this, actually. The service was super fast and friendly - definitely worth coming to!",

Noodles were nice and chewy, the broth was flavorful and at the right temperature, soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and even though you cannot see it on the picture there is chasu pork. The pork is well cooked: soft and not dry. But I definitely wish there was more of it.  We also got the takoyaki that was cooked nicely and had a good amount of octopus. They have many different types of ramen and I cannot wait to go back and try the other ones!",

I've tried a couple places- north of Phoenix and Scottsdale and was mildly disappointed with them. The taste just wasn't there. BUT THIS PLACE. Damn. All the flavor came out, strong and tasty. I love me some flavorful soupy ramen. They also said they offer 2 different types of noodle- straight and curvy. Try the straight, as I was told that's made in-house and is softer. But this place definitely hit the spot if you're craving ramen!! One thing I would add is that they only give you a piece of pork (if you get pork tonkatsu)... so maybe order extra meat if you're not carbo-loading. Idk I'm used to getting at least 2-3 pieces of meat in my ramen so that's just me..",

    "text": "I've been to the other Nishikawa location and had never been to the one on Indian School. I happened to be in the area and was craving ramen.  I'm from Los Angeles, so my ramen palette, so to speak, is used to ramen that tastes closer to ramen from Japan.  Firstly, I ordered chicken karaage. The karaage here is very well cooked, well breaded and the perfect combo of crunchy to chicken meat. I'm used to it being served with Kewpie (Or Japanese Mayo) But here it was served with a dark sauce. I'm unsure what it was, but it surprisingly paired VERY nice with the karaage! 10/10 Would recommend.  For my main meal, I was SO excited to see curry ramen!!! I would have usually ordered the tonkatsu (it's usually what I order to see how good the ramen is). Buuuuuut, I LOVE Japanese curry and when I'm not home in LA, I CRAVE curry udon or karaage curry...... This. Curry. Ramen. Did. Not. Disappoint!  It was perfectly balanced with the chashu, noodles, onion and tempura crispies! I've been looking for an Arizona location that serves a good Japanese curry udon, but this curry ramen REALLY hit the spot!! It's very mild, so if you prefer spicy curry, add some spicy powder to it. I appreciate that the curry wasn't overly watery or overly thick. It was perfect. And it came with an egg so I didn't have to request an egg with my meal. 10/10 Will be back FOR SURE for this meal.  This place is fairly small but we were seated right away and all of our meals came right away. Service was great and the atmosphere was pretty relaxing. Good music playing and it was not crowded (came around 2pm-ish)  The only thing was they ran out of Asahi beer, which wasn't a huge biggie. We ordered Kirin instead.  All in all, this place tasted like home and I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu! Thanks for a good experience Nishikawa!",

The broth is flavorful and the portions are just right. I will say that if you ask them to spice it up they bring it!

I am sure the pork broth is good since they devote so much menu space to it but they should show the veggie stock some love. It needed a ton more flavor. Also all ramen comes with an egg except for the veggie ramen but they charge the same price. I had to pay extra to get my egg. Not fair somehow since the veggie ramen has to be cheaper to make than all the others. I would go back if they added a chicken broth and had more for non-pork eaters to choose from on the ramen menu.

With our most recent trip, my husband and I agreed it's the best ramen we've had here in Arizona--and it's the closest to our favorite spots back in Hawaii where great ramen exists everywhere!   This time around, the service was extremely pleasant and accommodating--huge huge HUGE improvement from just 5 days prior.   Thank you Nishikawa Ramen for making things right and implementing quick changes to not only improve your business, but overall provide a better restaurant experience. We'll be regulars!",

The chicken gyoza was cooked to perfection and is some of the best I've ever had. My spicy miso ramen had the right amount of heat and a nice creamy broth with a rich flavor. The only thing I would change were the noodles were a tad over cooked and kind of stuck together. However, this was only a minor issue and did not take away from the amazing flavors in the ramen. The service was friendly, prompt and courteous. I will definitely be back and have recommended this place to a lot of people!",

I honestly think it is a lot  better than most of the ramen I've had here, including the ones in top notch Japanese restaurants in the valley. If I were to compare it to the ramen in LA, it wouldn't come close to 4 stars. I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal nonetheless.  For the ramen, I was told the Nishikawa black was the tastiest one but I opted for the tonkotsu. It was good; it was definitely on the salty side. The pork was fatty and tasty, not as tender as I would like it to be but it was not bad. We also had the beef bowl which was excellent. Our server warned us that the meat would be fatty. It was so good and tender. I couldn't believe that it only cost us $5.  I will definitely be back to try the other ramen styles.",

It was hard to bite and I felt the need for a knife and fork. The broth was pretty good and I loved the soft boiled egg. The noodles were well cooked and tasted fresh. I like how they give you a carafe of water on the table as well. The restaurant itself is small and quaint and I enjoyed eating in. The takoyaki was pretty good. If you're craving takoyaki it will definitely curb the craving, but they deep fry their takoyaki so it's a bit different than what you would get in Japan. All in all it was pretty delicious and I'm very happy there is a Japanese restaurant in town. Try it out!!",

Definitely diff then the traditional ramen. The noodles are not traditional but they were good, good firmness without being under or over cooked and they make them in house. Broth was super flavorful and garlic was def very present. I did get an extra hard boiled egg. Very, very tasty. Also just FYI the fat on the pork is supposed to be there it adds to the flavor, I just peel the fat off. The pork was very tender.  I would def give it a solid 4 stars. It is so far the better of the 3 places I have tried around the valley ( I had given up). This is not my first Ramen rodeo folks!   Service is good also...heyyyy Emily and Debbie.

I had the tonkotsu broth, which was delicious, though not as thick as I generally like it. I asked to trade the pork chasu for another egg (I don't care for big pieces of pork) and they would not allow substitutions. Traditionally, ramen is highly customizable, so I was surprised by this. They were willing to remove the pork, but not replace it with a lower priced egg.   When my food arrived it looked and tasted great! However the \"soft-boiled\" egg was so hard that it was difficult to cut, even with my spoon. My stainless steel water glass had black spots on the inside (it may have been rust?) so I did not drink any water. The service was pretty good, but because of the dirty glass, over cooked egg, and no substitutions, I could only give 4 stars. I would definitely go back, but next time get the curved noodles and I would bring my own water bottle.",

Some other places marinade the squid before deep frying.  This place seems to just put lots of salt.  It was pretty salty, but the dipping sauce was pretty sweet so it evened out.  It's strange to see honey mustard in a Japanese menu.  I had the Tonkotsu ramen.  The soup was nice and rich.  Lots of wood ear mushrooms.  I first thought it was seaweed because it was long, dark slender strips.  The noodles were cooked just perfectly.  The chashu was extremely tender where it started falling apart when I picked it up.  Wish they didn't cook as much.  The egg is hard boiled unless you request soft boiled which I normally pick.  The ice tea was oolong tea, but it was $4.00.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but I didn't expect it to be that expensive.  Didn't taste much different from the ice tea I get from other restaurants.  They give you a pitcher of ice water filled with lemons.  I wish they asked if you wanted lemons in the water.  I love lemons, but the lemon flavor was interfering with the flavor of the food.  Maybe if they put in less lemons or if I added some sugar I could make lemonade.  Great service.  The wait staff went around making sure all the tables were good.",

It's the closest restaurant we can find that doesn't really f*** up a good spicy miso ramen. In Hawaii, we have Sapporo style miso ramen which is delicious. You'll agree with me that this place is just okay if you've tried Hawaii, Japan, or Cali ramen. Their takoyaki was good but I was disappointed by how little they give of actual tako (octopus) that was inside the balls. Their ramen broth is somewhat inconsistent. One night it was salty. The other night it wasn't as salty. Their ramen is creamy and fatty (how I like it). It's not like watered down or see through like some other ramen places. This restaurant is small so don't be coming in here all the time with parties of 10 and being all loud. Be respectful to people who are eating by themselves or on a date with their loved one. Prices ($) are reasonable here. I can tell that the gyoza is the frozen kind from the Asian store. I would like this place more if they sold homemade pork and cabbage gyoza. Other than that, 3 stars. Also, for their chicken karaage (please don't call it breaded chicken or chicken karage, you will hurt my ears), I wish they served it with Siracha-Mayo sauce. Not a sweet peanut sauce.",

The shop is kinda small, big enough to fit maybe 25-30 diners at once. The music they play is all anime theme songs - not really my taste but I expected that from the window art in front. Regardless, we didn't even get ramen. I ended up ordering the beef bowl while my fiance  got the spicy tuna bowl. It was pretty good, and the bowls aren't very big so it feels like a light meal. We will try this place again for the ramen sometime soon.",

We tried the karaage, nishikawa black, and tonkotsu. The karaage had a good crunch, was light and crispy!  The Nishikawa black ramen was good, the noodles were perfect, great soft egg with a good amount of flavor, but it did seem like the amount of black garlic oil was overpowering. The tonkotsu has good flavor, but the noodles seemed a bit soft for both of us! Overall pretty good ramen shop, especially for Phoenix!  **I would add - double check your receipts I noticed after that we got someone else's and it was for 15 dollars more than what I got. I should have checked at the time!",

We ordered miso ramen and tonkotsu Black. Tonkotsu Black was served with typical hakata ramen (thin) noodles. It is very easy to over cook this type of noodles. They did okay, but I would have preferred more texture, less cooking time.   Miso on the other hand uses regular egg noodles and this one was cooked perfectly.  Black has enough garlic in it but broth was a bit weak for my liking. Miso had good flavor, I would order miso next time or try Shio or Syoyu.  Gyoza was cooked well but well I prefer to eat my gyoza with simple soy sauce and vinegar, with a small drop of hot oil. They use something else for dipping sauce. Too bad as their gyoza was cooked just right.  Service was a bit of questionable side. I was confused who was our server and the one came often was just okay. I guess they are short-staffed or not used to handling large crowds.  I like some of their cute decors from Ghibli movies. I love his movies and was nice to see some characters stuff there.",

    "text": "Ramen is such a great meal for a cold rainy day! My boyfriend and I were able to come right when they opened at 11 and we weren't even the first ones in the door! This was our first time here, but just a word of wisdom, check the yelp waitlist because there can be a pretty long wait. For a starter, my boyfriend wanted to try the spring rolls. They were pretty good! They were very crispy and freshly fried. We also tried two different types of ramen. We tried the Yokohama ramen at a mild spice level with a soft boiled egg. While it was passable, the broth was not as flavorful as I would have liked. The curly noodles were perfectly cooked, though! We also tried the curry ramen at a medium spice level. I really enjoyed this ramen as the broth was very flavorful and had the taste of Japanese curry. They also don't hold back on the spice level! The soft boiled egg was absolutely delicious and definitely worth asking for. It was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. We will definitely be back to try some of the other ramen options.",

    "text": "Nishikawa ramen place seats about 30 people. We were there Saturday for lunch but managed to get a table. There's a fast turnover on tables so not a very long wait time.   They offer traditional ramen dishes and appetizers. All their ramen comes with straight white noodles or the curly yellow noodles. The curly ones had more of a bite and chewiness. We ordered the Yokohama, curry and Nishikawa ramen and they were all delicious, each very different from the other. I liked the fact that they gave option of either soft or hard boiled eggs and extra add-ins.   Their ika karage was delicious. It started off by having a strong ocean smell but it had nice chewiness and seasoning to it. It was cooked perfectly. Their chicken karage was equally tasty so it was perfect for my son who doesn't enjoy seafood.   Overall, very pleasant place to grab some ramen. Definitely will return to try their rice dishes.",

I tried the mango soda which is childishly sweet and fun. Then I got the black ramen which was the best idea. It was hot and flavorful and the waitresses were all very attentive and nice. I had a fabulous time. The ramen tastes even better as leftovers, I'm not sure how but I've been daydreaming about it so I'll be back!   This wasn't a date but I went with a friend and it's a nice place to catch up. You can't gossip much because the tables are close together and your neighbors will overhear.",

I came in around dinner time on Saturday, and it was busy, but there were still a few seats available. The place isn't big, but they've got a good layout to maximize tables. Food comes out really quick - which helps with the turnover rate, I think.  I kind of had my heart set on trying the fried squid (Ika Geso), so I got that. My server had a lot of good suggestions in terms of ramen, and highly recommended the Nishikawa Black. I do the opposite and order the Yokohama Style, which wasn't a bad idea but I probably should have gone with the recommendation. The fried squid was okay, a decent balance between the crunchy and the chewy. The sauce was like a miso mayo type of dip, and it was alright too. Overall, the fried squid was just good. I may order again, I may not. Who knows.  Anyways, on to the important part! The Yokohama was pretty good, and I wasn't mad about it. It didn't leave me as satisfied as I thought it would though, and I felt like it could have used more chashu (which was delicious, by the way). The broth was very mild in flavor. I will definitely be trying the Nishikawa Black next time!",

    "text": "Hipster Trendy Garbage! Since this place is so popular and I love ramen, we decided to try.  Started with chicken karaage and the Ikura bowl. They shouldn't be trying to pass this sad fried chicken as karaage. Over cooked and under seasoned. The dipping sauce, which made it taste even worse, tasted like some cheap bottle sauce you would find in the \"Oriental\" section at a grocery store. The Ikura bowl was just as disgusting. The salmon roe tasted as if they froze and thawed it multiple times. There's nothing wrong with frozen, but it's like they thawed it everyday and froze it at night when they didn't sell and repeated that process until they sell it. Next up Yokohama ramen. Sad watered down broth with cheap packaged noodles. I don't expect too much from the noodles, since I know they are store bought. Sadly they we're undercooked sitting in a broth that wasn't hot enough to cook them further. The worst part is the egg. They ran out of soft boiled eggs! Thanks for robbing me of one more umami flavor, especially since this ramen needed it badly. The pork pieces looked at first glance to be ok, until I took a bite. I immediately spat it out. I have nothing against pork fat. Fat is flavor. But the overcooked hardened and almost crunchy fat layer had no flavor anymore. Again robbing this dish of much needed flavor. The pork was mostly fat(99%), which would be ok except they somehow rendered all the flavor out already. I took one bite of noodle, one bite of pork, and sipped a little soup and that was all I could do.  The other bowl of ramen, which came about 10 minutes before mine, was the Nishikawa black. Since it was order with the hot level of spiciness, I didn't really get to taste the broth. Similar to the other bowl, the broth was too mild in comparison to the chili. I love spicy, but this had no balance. Since Japanese chili isn't that spicy to begin with, this was very disappointing. Someone was hungry or I think this bowl of ramen might have not gotten eaten either.  The abundance of people getting take out would make you think the food is of good quality. Since the seating is fairly minimal, I could see why take out was a preferred option. This goes along with take out orders being fulfilled before in store customers.  This is not authentic ramen. This is very much an American take on ramen, jazzed up to appear more authentic than it is. I actually went home and made myself a packet of store bought ramen to rid my mouth of the disgusting flavors of Nishikawa.  I had higher hopes for a place that had a smaller menu. Where the focus could be on making a few dishes really good instead of a lot of dishes just ok. But even that concept fails here and it fails hard.",

I ordered spicy Tonkotsu ramen with soft egg for first visit, and signature spicy Nishikawa black for second time, and they're just perfect for my appetite. I added a lot sides in my ramen and made it a colorful looking. I let them took out the chashu for me this time because their portion size is too big for me. I definitely want to try more food here once I travel to Phoenix again. I heard they already have two restaurants in Phoenix area. I hope they can open more in other cities, lol~ btw I never heard any ramen shop called Nishikawa, I thought it's super cool()  Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with soft egg, menma, kikurage, bean sprout, green onion, dried seaweed, fried onion and black&white sesame seed.

It's so close to home compared to the Chandler location, makes it super convenient/accessible. The flavors are amazing and complex in each individual ramen bowl, the noodles perfect amount of softness, pork chasu literally melts in your mouth!! They really do out a lot of work/passion into making the ramen, they cook it for at least 24 hours so you know it's going to be good!!! I really love this place so much & I heard they do delivery.. I will be visiting a lot more frequently. This is my ultimate go to ramen shop",

My ramen seemed like it was missing half the ingredients stated on the menu. Honestly, this is probably the most decent ramen place (when service is good) around the area. But with these wait times, it probably would have been more worth it to drive down to Tempe for ramen. If I were to come here again, I would go during lunch time.",

Unfortunately, what I witnessed with one of the workers may have possibly been a health code violation. She was refilling the water bottles that each table gets. As she was refilling, she dropped the top on the floor, and put it back on the bottle to be served to patrons. She also used her bare hands to guide ice into the bottles and in the midst of this activity, went to go get some paper for the receipt roll and then preceded to go back to touching the ice without washing her hands. I also noticed the ice scoop resides inside the container for ice, with the handle and all.   The employees could use some FDA food code trainings. I don't know what else is being done in the back where there is no one to witness any violations.",

They give you a giant pitcher of water to start. Awesome, I get thirsty. The waitress was amazing and friendly. She answered all my questions and then some. The place was small but very clean and nice. I drove 45 minutes from the West and it was worth every minute on I 10.  Now onto the food. I ordered some special ramen bowl and I was not disappointed. The broth was so good and savory. The first sip could quench an eternal thirst. It was fatty, yet clean. Deep and rich. Perfect amount of umami. The straighy noodles are made in house daily and i tasted the freshness. They are not too thick or too thin. The Perfect balance. They soaked up all that great broth. After finishing my first amount of noodles, I ordered more noodles. So freaking delicious. Next, the egg was on point. I ordered it soft boiled and you should too. Your a Neanderthal if you want it hardboiled. The softboiled egg was perfectly cooked. Gooey in the middle and bouncy on the outside. Lastly, but definitely not least, the chasu was heavenly. It was thick and included a large portion. It had a smokey flavor that melted in your mouth. No literally, it melted in my mouth. Even though the portion was generous, I wanted more but my stomach couldn't so it.  I ate my fill and then some. My buddy who is like 5'6 ate two full bowls. We went into a food coma. I need to go there again.",

    "text": "Definitely the best ramen I've had in Phoenix. A few quibbles, but the food is definitely good and satisfying. We arrived at around 1 on a Friday and it was quite busy, we had to wait a few minutes for a table.   I actually ordered the salmon roe rice bowl rather than ramen for my first meal. You can guess from the price (just over $5) that it's not going to be huge. But it's far enough from a full entree that I thought that should have been mentioned in the menu, which it was not. The bowl it's served in is tiny, basically overflowing with food. Which means when you start to eat it, it makes a mess. Food can't help but spill over the edges, because there's no room to spare in the bowl. It's a little like when you're served a martini in a glass that's so full you can't safely lift it to your mouth to drink it. Still, I enjoyed the combination of ingredients and it was satisfying.   My wife had been once before and got the tonkotsu ramen, which she said was very good, though still not competing with the better places we've been in NYC. Today she got the curry ramen, medium spicy, and was very pleased. She has a decent tolerance for spice, and was glad she didn't go beyond medium. That bowl had kick.   We shared pork gyoza to start. The crust on the wrapper was very pleasing, though the filling was a bit bland to my taste, and the ice cold dipping sauce detracted a bit from the enjoyment.   One odd service note. We both ordered green tea. It didn't arrive at the table until well after our main courses were served. Hard to understand why. It was just a little teapot with a bag of green tea, not some big elaborate production. Even by the end of the meal, the tea was so weak it barely tasted like tea at all. Left with most of the tea undrunk in the pots. Other than that, service was pretty good. I'll try some more of the menu. I wish we had better options, but for now this one will do.",

I asked a different server if we could take it off because we had obviously not touched the salmon bowl, and she said since we didn't send it back to the kitchen we were going to be charged. I feel like when i say \"oh i didn't know it was salmon eggs and immediately ask for a pork bowl it implies that we were not going to eat it. After arguing with the server that we had never even touched the food she charged us for she just took the check and walked away. She gave us the check and eventually took the salmon off, but at this point was not talking to us at all. I honestly felt i asked very nicely to switch out the bowl and was very apologetic the entire time. And it seems like we just got sass in response and then had to argue further to get the food taken off. Food was good, service was terrible. Ruined the experience and will not be returning. Since when do restaurants not take back food that you don't like? Well this one doesn't so if you order something don't expect to send it back for a refund.",

    "text": "Great that AZ has ramen,,,unfortunate that it still has a long way to go for some decent ramen spots to open up. This place was no exception and fell in line with below average even for Az standard IMO, because AZ has no established competition YET. I think the \"fusion\" component to their cooking translates to \"we use MSG\" because their chashyu was laced with it...possibly the broth too which was very thin and lacked the layers of flavor and texture you get with decent Tonkotsu broth.  The only reason I gave them one star was because their \"curly noodle\" was their saving grace & they apparently make their noodles fresh-which I can appreciate. The chicken karaage was abnormally overcooked with a strange flavor-and upon mentioning it to the waitress, she explained they tend to over cook them since they have had complaints in the past of chicken being undercooked-so they want to make sure they are DONE. I can appreciate that, but if you really know how to do it right...it's possible to make chicken karaage juicy, crisp and golden. Not black/brown and tough.  I guess being 1/2 Japanese living in LA with so many options that are pretty damn close to authentic Ramen has spoiled me. I wish this place luck and hope they survive, if anything..to give other prospective \"players\" a chance to consider to open a kick ass place in Az because ramen does have popularity here.   This place is at least better than a poke in the eye on a chilly Arizona winter night.   Oh-and another note-on their website, they say: Nishikawa Ramen \"Here is where we were granted the opporitunity of learning from a master of ramen. Through him we were taught the art of a creamy broth, the beauty of a perfect noodle, and the science of a flawless ramen bowl.\"    I think they need to do a little more \"learning\" or stick to what they DID learn and not edit it to cater to a non-Japanese palate, because this statement obviously means nothing based on what they served.",

    "text": "WOWOWOWOW!!! FINALLY! After visiting Japan last year and being spoiled by the best ramen at every turn I have been looking to recreate the experience here in Phoenix. I had heard of Nishikawa Ramen but never had the desire to drive out to the east side and try it. I am so happy they opened a location closer to home. This is the closest to authentic ramen in Phoenix and I would say it's not far off from what I had in Tokyo. The tonkotsu broth is silky smooth and savory. The noodles are homemade and I may or may not have been slapped in the face with them because I was eating so fast! The pork chashu is generously portioned but you can add extra for $2. Clocking in at a whopping $9.95 it's a great deal. I've already been here three times in the last two weeks and I can't wait to try everything they offer!",

Service is always prompt, even when the restaurant is super busy during the working lunch hours, which makes it pretty easy to take a 1 hour lunch, travel included.  For those who enjoy Japanese curry, I highly recommend the curry ramen. The broth is a thick and flavorful one that's ultra savory and leaves me feeling so satisfied and warm after. I usually modify mine by getting curly noodles instead of straight noodles, and a soft boiled egg instead of hard boiled. I've also had almost all of the appetizers, and my favorites are the takoyaki and ika geso karaage. The takoyaki is super hot but packed with flavor and a huge chunk of octopus. They're very generous on the toppings (kewpie mayo, sauce, and shaved bonito flakes) which was a welcome surprise. The ika geso karaage is fried super crisp on the outside but tender on the inside, again with great flavor. The dipping sauce that's served with it is so good that I'll take the bed of shredded cabbage that it's sitting on and use that as a vehicle for sauce.",

The noodles were cooked to perfection and were infused with a spicy tang that complimented the rest of the ingredients.   They even asked me how I wanted my egg cooked.

After all, I ate a lot of ramen noodles when I was in college once upon a time, but this is nothing (let me repeat that NOTHING) like any ramen noodles I have had before. Maybe it's all about the additional ingredients and the way they cook this, but I'm hooked, particularly on the Nishikawa Black. So yummy!   Of course, you'll be tempted to eat the everything in your bowl because the flavors are that good, but if you don't, you can have leftovers for tomorrow. Disclaimer: I ate the whole bowl and was rather stuffed.  Service was also excellent. At 2 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed, but we didn't have to wait more than ten minutes before we were at a table. If you do have to wait, they will text you when your table is ready, just don't go too far.  So, I'm super excited about going back and slurping up that broth and those noodles because ramen has a whole new meaning to me.",

The first time, we ordered WAY too much food.  Ramen bowls here are gigantic, but we thought \"oh, it's just soup\" and went crazy on the appetizers.  And boy, are there some fun options for appetizers!  We had the pork gyoza, which were so good that we ended up ordering a second platter of them, with a touch of lacy crisp and some delicious flavor.  We also had some spring rolls and the takoyaki, which we'd never had before.  Apparently it's a bread-wrapped octopus ball with some moving fish flakes on top!  Only go for that one if you're in an adventurous mood, or if you're taking some shots of sake for courage.  We also had some spicy tuna on rice.  If you're a huge poki fan, I would skip this one, since it's very simple compared to what you're used to.  The ramen here is really the star of the menu, which you expect since you're at a ramen house.  My Nishikawa Black was so good that I want to go back and get another bowl while I'm sitting here writing about it.  Prices are incredible as well.  They're starting to have some wait times, since people are discovering this place, but that's too be expected.   Anyway.  Go.  Now.",

You can sign in on Yelp though!  They are also picky about tables, you must have the same number of people in your party as there are chairs at the table.  This is very fair though due to the size of the place.  Trust me, its worth the wait.  Simple menu with a variety of appetizers and a few ramen choices.  I keep to pretty traditional pork ramen and add black garlic.  You can choose the noddles, but I stick with what it comes with, also traditional.  Another interesting option is how you want your egg cooked.  Soft boiled all the way for me!  Broth is hearth and full of flavor!    Craving ramen!  Be sure to stop by Nishikawa!  Enjoy!",

Some places really dumb down the concept of \"hot\". The chashu meat that comes with the ramen is decent.   Ordered the chashu bowl - it's on the smaller side but in the end it fulfilled my hunger. The downside to the bowl is that they only give one slice of meat. Paying 6 dollars for a tiny bowl I was hoping I could get one more.   The takoyaki was mediocre - it's more fried than I'm used to but oddly enough it was very mushy inside with one piece of octopus. It's missing the bonito flakes on top too.   Overall it's decent. It's the closest ramen to me in Arcadia so will definitely come back again to try other items.  They were playing Korean songs here - have to give them thumb up for that.",

    "text": "Superb noodles!   Recently went here for a weekday lunch with some friends from work.  We were greeted by a cheerful waitress and seated immediately.    The menu was simple and reasonably priced.  The Ika Geso Karaage was fun and yummy.   My Tonkotsu was savory without being over indulgent. One additional slice of pork in the Tonkotsu would be nice!   The beef bowl that my friend ordered was very small but very delicious.  He was surprised by the small size of the dish, however, given its low cost, he should not have been surprised.   The service was excellent.  We were given a pitcher of water so we didnt have to wait for water.  The waitress was cordial and attentive but stayed out of our way and allowed us to fully enjoy our meals without interruption, though she checked in at just the right moments in an undisturbing way.  Excellent balance of being attentive while not disturbing the diners' enjoyment of their meals.   I am happy that we stopped in and I am sure to visit again and again, very good noodles and good service at a good price.  Thank you!",

The restaurant can feel a bit small, but that's only because they are so popular! If you come during a peak time, expect to wait a bit. But it's SO WORTH IT!   The first time I came here we tried almost all the apps, their gyoza is super delicious and by far my favorite.  We've also tried their bowls which was quite tasty as well.   Always have had friendly service and really enjoyed the experience of eating there. After writing this review... I'm now craving their ramen so I guess I'll see you here tomorrow! ;)",

I got the Miso Soup at medium spicy - excellent flavor and tempting to gorge if you have no self control. Big chewy noodles. The boiled egg was deliciously brown from broth water. The pork was extremely tender with delicate lines of fat running through.   A cozy restaurant - easy to find seating if you're only a party of 2. Big groups, come prepared to wait 30mins - 1hr to push a few tables together.   Servers are friendly - just make sure to stand your ground if you're still eating. Sometimes they can rush you a bit when they're others parties waiting to be seated.   I hear they're going to open up more locations soon.",

We tried the Shio, Miso, Tonkotsu, Nishikawa Black, and the Yokohama style. Everyone was satisfied, as it tasted just like it does back home. Gyoza was also pretty good. The prices were good in comparison to portion and taste :) my only complaint was that it was a tad bit salty, and the spicy options aren't very spicy.

We started off with the Chicken Gyoza, which had a light crispy texture and were very tasty. I then had the Tonkotsu Ramen with a bit of powdered chili spice, it was delicious! I will go back to check out the rest of the Ramen.",

Came in a plastic to go cup that seems reusable. - Gyoza softer than expected. Most places fry it too much and the skin gets hard. This was crunchy on edges, but soft on sides. Delicious sauce and meat.  Not so good: - Small seating area, limited seats.  - Out of squid legs. With a limited menu, would think they'd have a very good handle on supply and demand and have inventory well controlled after a year at this location. - No free refills on the iced teas. Unusual. Even if it's special tea, it's still likely relatively inexpensive. - Pork seemed to be boiled, making the meat tough. Used to it being slow roasted, and super tender, this is the Asian way. Here, quick boil was the way sadly. - My friend didn't want to use chopsticks. Recommend a no fork policy.   Summary: - Still overall very good first visit. Would go again and again. Limited ramen places. If the idea catches on and more ramen places pop up, that may help improve on the weaknesses.",

I had a taste for some Ramen and as always I turned to my foodie BFF Yelp. She rarely steers me wrong  I took a study break, dropped in, sat at the bar, ordered and studied my pharmacology cards. My ramen was out in NO time. Let me tell you, that broth is EVERYTHANG! I mean sheesh, that's the base of the ramen. Bad broth, bad ramen! Welp not here! They note that they boil their broth for 20 hours and I can certainly believe it! Thanks to the cook who keeps his eyes on it that long, or actually remembers to check on it! You're the real MVP! The noodles are made from scratch! And its obvious!!!! And don't you dare order without getting a boiled egg. That egg seals the meal! I was so impressed. Literally a taste of Japan with every bite! I will be sure to visit again! Go check out it out y'all! It's worth the hype! It's affordable, fast and the service was good. I have zero complaints....other than not having a pot of that broth in my freezer. ",

Okay, the area is small but don't just judge yet because the food is mind blowing. We went in around 5 pm, no wait line, got seated quickly. Placed our orders, Spicy miso ramen (hot), Karage Chicken and Pork Gyoza. All the items came hot and fresh. God, those Gyozas were so so good, so much close to what I had in Japan in terms of taste.  Coming to Chicken Karage, they were tasty. Light breading and perfectly fried, crispy yet flavorful. Last, the ramen. The noodles was perfectly cooked, the egg was soft boiled, got the runny yolk on my ramen with soft pork chasu. I also added a side of garlic oil and it enriched the flavor. Not to forget, the broth was superb.   Can't wait to go back and try the black ramen! Highly recommend this place for ramen lovers. The price, quality of food, and customer service does so much justice to this place. No wonder they are always busy.",

They do a good job with the broth and the noodles which is most of the battle.  The broth was thick, fatty, and flavorful.  Other places just don't make strong broth, like they're afraid to be bold and turn people off or something.  I dunno.  This place makes it with a gusto which makes it so different.  I'm not a huge fan of the thin noodles (even when I lived in Japan) but they're authentic.  The karaage is a US version of it with more fat and fried parts and less chunky chicken.  Not sure what the sauce was, but they could probably improve the dish with more flavor in the batter and a couple of thinner sauces.  The texture overall was good.  Friendly service, easy parking, they bring a water carafe to your table (I was thirsty when I came in so that was nice).  Plus, the ramen is under $10.  I really hate \"gourmet\" $15 ramen places.  Ramen is one of the cheapest meals you can get in Japan, not fine dining, and doesn't need expensive fakeness.  It just needs  flavor.  It's a small place, and one thing I didn't like was that the tables are close together.  I grabbed a seat at the high countertop and was there before noon but as more and more people came in you could see how close things were.  I guess in an odd way you can it's authentic Tokyo.",

It's a tiny little place, but works well as the flow of people were in and out and I didn't feel like I was cramped in.   Decided to try the Tonkotsu traditional ramen with a soft boiled egg. The pricing was pretty fair compared to the food they give you. The broth was pretty standard for the ramen. Nothing extravagant. Add ons like garlic oil is a $1.50 more which I thought was ridiculous. For some oil? Really?   Also tried the takoyaki and it was pretty fair tasting compared to others in the Phoenix area. They added a lot of the flakes on top which I liked, but that's personal preference.   I think what makes this review average is the service. We sat at the bar, and the waitress was...cold? Indifferent? Didn't greet us when we came in, just looked at us, said \"for two?\" them directed us to the bar when asked if we wanted to sit there. There wasn't any interaction or friendly demeanor. When we got the check she just placed it on the table. That was it. I mean, part of the job is enacting good customer service, one that I believed  she definitely missed the mark on and made me less inclined to want to come back again.   Definitely still on the hunt for a good ramen place.",

I'm currently in Phoenix trying to find a place that can compare to the ramen in Japan. Nishikawa doesn't quite live up to it. The atmosphere was relaxing and the waitress was very friendly. With that said, I'm not saying Nishikawa has bad ramen. If you're looking for a mediocre bowl of Tonkotsu, then give it a try, but if you're looking for something that can compare up to REAL Japanese Tonkotsu then Nishikawa isn't the place for you.",

Tried so many places, some good, some bad, never quite hit the umami spot. No luck until NOW! Nishikawa brought us right back to Japan, nearly brought tears to our eyes :) My husband and I absolutely loved and enjoyed every last drop of the rich flavorful tonkotsu broth and the perfect noodles! Highly recommend the Nishikawa black ramen-- we love spicy ramen so we got HOT and were not disappointed!  To be honest with you, we were only in town for 3 days and we ate here twice :) OISHII!!  Thank you for the great food and hope to visit again next time we go to Phoenix!",

The egg, in which I look forward to eating when I have ramen, was not soft boiled it was hard boiled. So when eating it in the broth it had a powdery consistency which was not so appetizing.

    "text": "Hit/Miss, unfortunately. I went in for dinner and got a seat right away - plus. The waitress didn't show up for a while with the menu - minus. Once she showed up, I asked if they had Wi-Fi and imagine my surprise when she said no, they didn't, as if that's something natural at an eatery nowadays - minus, SMH.   The Chicken Kaarage was acceptable, but the pieces were all fried stuck together, so it was impossible to eat with chopsticks - minus. Of course, they were not on hand to offer other utensils. Seriously folks, if your story 'begins in Nishikawa,' you should know that Asian food is cut into bite-size pieces specifically so it can be eaten with chopsticks. I received 1/9th of a lemon, or a thin lemon slice - minus.    The Ika Geso Karaage was absolutely amazing, down to the Kewpie mayo - big, big plus. Although I was originally going to order the Tonkotsu Ramen, I went for the Nishikawa Black as recommended. They don't use Ramen noodles, but rather thin straight Soba noodles for this one - not good.   SMH, I should have read the fine print. I prefer Ramen to Soba, in part because Ramen's flavor and al dente. The Soba was not cooked and came in a cold clump on the bottom of the bowl, so I had to let the broth soften it for about 15 minutes by which time the broth was cold, so I didn't enjoy my Nishikawa Black experience. I want to come back to this restaurant to try the Tonkotsu Ramen, but for now this is overall a two-star experience.   This is also worth mentioning; if you happen to enjoy soothing, Zen-type music, don't give this place a try. I was assaulted by bad hip-hop mixes the whole time I was there, so my next 'experience' will be strictly pick-up.",

She shortly later came over and said our food will be right out.   Now keep in mind it was 30mins since we ordered and we still hadnt gotten our edamame and other appetizer we ordered.  It all came out together which made us want to rush.  I was going to rate it then and give them a 2 star, however the RAMEN WAS SOOOO GOOD.   Needless to say i been back there several more times lol, and have not experienced this delay that I did on my first visit.  No joke, GREAT FOOD!",

Next time I will opt for one of the more traditional broths, for some reason I was envisioning yellow curry. This was more of a red curry, but STILL delicious. The pork broth has a great Umami flavor. Would love a ramen bowl with Chicken Karrage already in it, that's why I got the Chicken Karrage appetizer. I was trying to copycat another place in San Fransisco that does it like that. The peanut sauce the chicken came with was pretty tasty. All in all, if you are looking for a great ramen place in Phoenix, this is it! And worth the trip!  P.S. Medium spicy was nice. I like things spicy, this had a nice amount of spice, while not overpowering the flavor of the dish.",

I could taste the porkiness, which was nice, but never I my life have I had a miso broth that tasted like it needed salt. So I was a little disappointed.

I have since searched back in my hometown of AZ for some decent ramen as some shops have opened up but they have been lackluster at best. Until today, I finally stopped by Nishikawa. It is a quaint little ramen restaurant that was relatively full on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I had their traditional ramen and it was delicious. You can add spicyness to your bowl, but I opted against that as I wanted to try it as is. At first I thought it was a bit bland but as I continued to eat and mix the ingredients around, the broth became much more rich and flavorful. I also had the pork gyoza which was really good as well. It had a nice little crispy crunch to it as it seemed to be pan seared just briefly on one side. Added a nice texture to the otherwise soft nature of it. I also liked that they leave a carafe of water at your table as well so you can refill your water as you'd like. They have green tea and various other Japanese beverages too. They will be having liquor very soon as they are just waiting for their liquor license to arrive in the mail. Prices were decent as well for the ramen and add ins. The bowl was $10 and add ins about $1.50. Appetizers are about $2-6 but you got 6 gyoza for the $6. It was delicious and I will be back for more!",

However, it happens to be in an area I am around quite often.  Their noodles aren't very great either. If you want GOOD NOODLES, go to Clever Koi. Best I have had in the Valley.   p.s. I find it a bit pricey and it reminds me of fast food! I would rather go get some good Pho somewhere! YES I realize they are totally different flavors, but at least Pho will have SOME flavor depending on where you go!",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place so we gave it a try last weekend. We were early so the place wasn't busy yet. Our servers were attentive and kept checking on us. We tried a number of items including gyoza, takoyaki, two types of ramen (disappointed though they ran out of chicken karaage).  The appetizers were decent but didn't necessarily blow us away. The ramen on the other hand were really good. Great broth and we loved their curly noodles; my order came with straight noodles (you can see which noodles each bowl comes with by looking at the detailed description on the menu) and while they were fine we definitely preferred the texture of the curly ones.  Happy to see more decent ramen places popping up in the valley. We will be back!",

We were okay with that. I was so excited to try the food that I sat and waited at an outdoor table for my name to be called. With a party of four, I knew seating us might be difficult, but around 740 I excited to see the waitress putting extra chairs around a table. I was finally about to get in. Unfortunately the waitress came out to say they had called my name 15-20 minutes prior and no one answered because no one was outside. That was a pretty bold lie considering I had been sitting there watching the delivery orders go out for the past 35ish minutes. Then she said the manager even called my name... again, a lie. I would like to say they seated us immediately and apologized for the wait, but instead she said it would be an additional 25 minutes....We did not stay because at this point we are all too hungry to wait any longer, even though the smells coming out of the to go bags were heavenly. Hopefully in the future I am able to actually review the food, but it's just not in the cards tonight.",

The menu is small and simple but totally perfect.  The first Ramen I tried was their Tonkotsu. The broth was super flavorful and not too salty; the hard boiled egg had that amazing pork broth saturated all the way through.  I was not sure if I would like the straight noodles but not only did I like them,  I now prefer them over the wavy ones! For the first time in my life I actually finished a whole bowl of Ramen,  broth and all.  And that's how I knew I had to go again the next day to try a different one! They get all 5 stars because the food is amazing,  the service is fast and attentive,  the prices are fair,  the place is cozy and clean,  and I love how they leave you with your own carafe of water infused wth lemon.  I can't wait to go back and try all of their Ramen dishes.",

We have traveled to Japan and this comes very close to our first bowl of ramen in Osaka.  Beer was cold, sake was hot, and we were delighted.  My only comments would be the inane newscasters on the television.  Why not project some Anime?  Certainly glad we were not \"assaulted\" by loud music, as one reviewer commented.  But, perhaps some old Kurosawa?  Would be oh so much more fun.  Oh, and some grilled shishito peppers?  And perhaps golden curry on rice to accompany your fried chicken?",

We found it on Yelp and had to try it out as our bellies were growling for some delicious food past normal dinner time on a Saturday night. We got to the restaurant around 9pm and there were two to three other tables. They left as we were ordering. At the time we were the only customers. The server took our order and even asked what we'd like to have on the TVs. The gyoza arrived first and very quickly. I got the pork gyoza and they were perfect, soft yet crispy in all the right places. The ponzu sauce for dipping was delicious with multiple flavors happening at once and the green onion giving it that bite. The two bowls of ramen arrived shortly after. My wife got the tonkatsu ramen with the housemade noodles. I got the miso ramen. The broth was so full of depth and richness. The flavor was amazing. All of the ingredients inside worked together so well for your typical miso ramen. My belly is so full and happy. The service was amazing and so was the food. We'll be back for sure to earn our free bowl of ramen after scarfing down ten bowls.",

Read on for more: I was sad to see that Nishikawa had received a poor rating from the health department a few months ago and have steered clear until Saturday when I was craving a bowl of savory, delicious ramen. Nishikawa has been my go-to ramen fix since I returned from Japan after spending 19 blissful, ramen-rich years in Japan. Nishikawa used to be the closest I could find to genuine, savory ramen. The bowl of ramen I was served on Saturday was not the worst I've ever had, buy it was a close second. The broth was tasteless when it should have been rich and savory, the shashu which should melt in your mouth, was rubberry, the noodles were over cooked, the toppings were minimal, AND the yolk of the hard boiled egg was cold when it should have been warm at least. The shashu bowl was decent, but the skimped too much on the shashu. My greatest disappointment is my last best hope for a decent bowl of ramen has vanished here in Phoenix now.",

After waiting for a bit and seeing other parties enter we were a bit confused and popped inside just to get glares from the staff. We waited another ten minutes or so before heading to the front only to discover there was a waitlist which we not informed of on either occasion and since we didn't put our names on it we had been waiting for nothing. I explained what happened to the hostess who could not care less and said there's nothing to be done. Accordingly, we left and will never return. Although they may have great ramen according to other reviews they clearly don't know how to run a business. Why a business would put there waitlist in the back of the restaurant is beyond me, but as we saw multiple parties wait around confused or leave it's certainly costing them business which is fine by me.",

    "text": "I really wish I could give this review a higher rating but I left here only feeling satisfactory. The food is 5/5, don't be afraid to try the takoyaki! I'm not big on octopus, and I loved this appetizer. The Miso and Nishikawa ramen is amazing as always.   Please note my mom has come to this location 5+ times and has never had bad service. I've only been to the one in chandler and probably won't come back to this location. This location is small. There's about 11 spots to sit at. We came in with a party of 9 for my sisters 16th birthday and were told previously on the phone it's first come first serve bases and we were okay with that.  The girl who helped us was named Allison and was not very friendly and needs to learn a lot. We asked if we could sit down at two tables waiting for the rest of our party, they said it was okay but we would also have to wait for a couple next to us to get up so our party can fit. That was fine.  Our server (Allison) did not offer us waters in the duration that we were waiting. Someone else asked us how are food was tasting and checked up on us. We had to periodically ask for more silverware for the kids and was not even offered the little trainer ones if they even had them. There was even a group next to us who had the same issue but just finally got upset and got up to ask her. Easy solution to this is 'eye contact' coming from someone who's a server/bartender and deals with 11+ tables a day. Granted they were fully sat and quite busy but that shouldn't prevent good service.  She dropped off our checks without saying a word and no one greeted us bye on our way out.  If this were a secret shopper report she would have failed.   We obviously were celebrating something and that was not acknowledged at all. Our server Allison needs a lesson in empathy/compassion or the service industry isn't for her.",

    "text": "This is the most authentic ramen you will find in all of Phoenix, hands down. After traveling to Japan several times, I recently moved to Phoenix. Eager to find something that resembled the ramen made with such passion like back in Japan, I found myself continuously losing hope with every so called \"ramen shop\" in town I tried. Trying what feels like every ramen shop around, from bland broth (Tampopo) to ramen with toppings with ADHD (SoSoba) my hope dried out like the dry pork bellies that caused it to become void.  Until....two days ago.  This gem, this diamond, this glorious almighty savior of ramen in Phoenix had opened to ignite that light of hope in me.  With the first sip of the Tonkotsu ramen broth, I closed my eyes and was instantly transported back to the streets of Shibuya. The complex flavors danced around in my mouth like a melodic symphony. I wanted to run to the chef and on my knees bow down to him for providing me this gift, this taste, this feeling, of being right there, back in Japan enjoying ramen made with passion and love.  After I came back down from this ecstasy, I moved on to the noodle; incredible! (I was told by the waiter were made in house. (Again passion!)) Then on to the pork belly; succulent! Then to my ultimate test, the egg...ace! Oh man, those flavors, the layers intertwining with one another, the complexity! I was not let down!  If I ever want to make a quick trip back to Japan for some ramen, I'll start my car and drive 12 minutes down the road.  Gochisosama Deshita!!!!!!!!",

We came in around 5:30 on a Sunday night and were sat a table for 2, despite having 3 people instead of being seated at a table for 4 because the \"dinner rush\" was coming -- this would've been fine except the waitress was rude in saying so, and there was a couple that had just been seated in a corner booth suited for 4?  My aunt ordered the vegetarian ramen, which was extremely salty and the \"vegetables\" that came with it were sprouts, onions and corn. We asked to sub one of the \"vegetables\" for spinach and was told it wouldn't be possible. The saving grace of the tonkatsu ramen was that the spice level was actually decently spicy. Although the ramen came with straight noodles and a hard boiled egg -- no traditional ramen shop would ever. Additionally, to add maybe 2 tablespoons of plain corn (not buttered, salted or anything) was $1.50!  Even the customer service was poor. We watched a family of 5 come in, and the waitress that greeted us told them \"We don't have any tables right now.\" and then walked away -- didn't ask if they wanted to wait for a table or anything.   Would maybe give them another chance, and would definitely make sure to have the curved noodles and a soft boiled egg.",

    "text": "Nishikawa Ramen!! Gosh, what can I say Im just really love having these diverse cultural dives popping out here in the Valley. I AM truly a huge fan of this Ramen restaurant especially, when they marinate the broth for more than 20 hrs and they make their noodles from scratch fresh every morning- i mean you know this place is top notch! I love my Ramen, Seafood and asian food and Its because im born/raised in Oahu, Honolulu where we have so much of these places back home. Ive been too a few here in the Valley and it was \"One time deal only\" but, I come here once a week usually for \"Take out!\" but, this past week was my first time I actually had some time to bring a co-worker and we ate in! Shes a vegetarian so I was surprised they had a Veggie Ramen, sorry im all about having chasiu in my Ramen - my favorite dish is the Nishikawa Black - all my favorite ingredients and just every single bite and slurp of their pork broth Its so divine!! For our appetizer I suggested we have their \"Takoyaki\" now, if you are not a seafood person - stick with the gyozas or something else because you wont acquire the taste! But, their Takoyaki is one of the BEST Takoyaki I had ever tasted before in my entire life! Not even back home in Honolulu - just cannot compare at all! I even asked the waitress what is in the ball and she kept saying the dough/steaming! Whatever it was \" literally melts in your mouth\" and pieces of the octopus - gosh, totally worth it for us seafood lover! The funny part is because it came out steaming hot and they put the furikake (seaweed) and flakes of the dry skin octopus on it was moving... Hahaha! My friend was like \"what da???\" Lol- i told her \"Hello, Its steaming hot so the octopus flakes is just shrinking I grabbed some of it and ate it... Lol! So she feels comfortable and know Its Okay, too eat! Cracked up laughing told her \"Eh, good thing no more the eyes!\" Lol- eat that too! Lol Im Happy to advertise this place and Happy they make one of the best Ramen place in the Valley! I do however agree with some of the Yelp reviews on here that their young kids in here sometimes give bad customer service! - just smile girls, breathe, and relax!! Lol",

The place has zero ambiance. When we ordered our ramen with soft boiled egg they brought us hard boiled and said it was because they were all out of soft boiled...how do you \"run out\" of soft boiled eggs? Don't you just boil them for less time? Weird.",

The waitress asked us if we had any questions and then explained the difference between the straight and the curly noodles. We started off with an order of Pork Gyoza and Takoyaki. My favorite between the two was the Gyoza, although I wish both sides of the dumpling had been seared rather than just the one side. I ordered the Nishikawa Black Ramen and substituted the curly noodles for the straight ones. I also ordered my egg soft-boiled (thanks fellow Yelpers!) and I enjoyed it. I didn't find it too salty at all. I only ate half of mine and was able to take the other half home for lunch the next day which was a bonus. I'm sure I will return another day!",

I found the seaweed to be too chewy and lacking its own flavor.  Overall, none of the ingredients have distinct flavors of their own.  Decent enough bowl of ramen.

It's close to my house so this will be a blessing and a curse.   QUALITY- The food was absolutely spectacular. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen with soft boiled egg and my boyfriend ordered a medium special curry ramen with hard boiled egg. He didn't like his that much since it was salty, but I absolutely loved mine! I however LOVE spicy food, so if you aren't a spicy person I wouldn't recommend ordering it. When I finished my bowl I was genuinely sad because it was so good I didn't want it to finish. Definitely a 10/10 for me.     SERVICE- Please keep in mind that it is a small joint with limited seating for about 30 people with a small bar/hightop area that faces the kitchen. We were lucky to have gotten the last open table there but we noticed it was a good mix of \"eat-and-go\" people and \"take-my-time-and-enjoy\" people. The server was a sweetheart and even warned me that the soup was spicy but I assured her I love spicy food and she was glad to take my order! We didn't wait long for our food even though they were busy which was great.   PRICE- I'm not an expert in pricing for ramen but I thought it was a good price for what I received. Like I said this is close to my house to I'll definitely be back again!",

My Black ramen was so salty I could consciously sense the renewal of my lingual papilae...in layman's term...I thought the outer layer of my tongue was falling off because my ramen was so salty. For $12? One could attempt creativity with a pack of Nissin Ramen (priced $.25), 1 single slice of pork (idk...$1) and end up with a much better culinary experience.  Karagge chicken was great though. Did not care for calamari.",

I ordered the fried calamari and it was a little tough. But you should try to attest.  Then moving on to the server. She's in front when I came in, as she told me that I can sit anywhere. Then, a couple with kids were behind me, and she did entertain them all the way, brought them down to the table. So in short, she took their order where I'm supposed to be the first one to be asked .  Luckily, another server just passed by my table so I took the chance and told him that I'm ready to order. End of story  But perhaps, this is something your management should keep an eye on. I'm not sure if she's one of those typical racists(?).

Service is friendly and quick. Side dishes are all delicious.  Cons: This location clearly has different staff in the kitchen and the food is not as good. The broth is much fattier and not as flavorful, the pork is fattier and tougher, and most of the time they are out of soft boiled eggs. It still gets the job done when I crave ramen but if I have time, I drive 30 min to Chandler.",

We had the Tonkotsu Bowl, Nishikawa Black, and the Curry Bowl. Everyone enjoyed the bowls and the appetizers. Tonkotsu is more traditional and probably had the best taste. We will return when in the area.",

That said, I rarely find good ramen in the US, and especially find it impossible to find great yaki gyoza.  Steamed on too, crispy on the bottom.  Well, found it at Nishikawa, amazing how good the broths are.  The Miso and Shoyu are excellent.  The yaki gyoza perfect.  Only suggestion, get hot oil (La-yu) for the gyoza and shichimi spice for the ramen.  I would pay extra, drop the lettuce and lemon slice.  This place is amazing",

But tonight, I was craving a bowl after having had an exremely long day at work. Picking up a bowl for take out was my ideal plan. I tried to look up the menu on their website to order for my husband. The way the website is formatted doesn't allow me to view the menu clearly on my phone. Thank you Yelp! Because of the menu images, I was finally able to find what I wanted to order.   Finally having my order ready, I called. And called. And called. And called. Their phone isnt working!  I hope theres nothong wrong and this business isnt going under. The food is amazing, but I don't undstand take put of you cant call it in. I dont want to sit or stand the bar for 15 min while Im hungry and waiting to go home.   I hate to give 3 stars because the food here is great but the lack of a phone now is just strange. I feel like any business should stay on top of the phone service to keep topnotch customer service available.",

The first thing we noticed was the terrible service. We were told to sit anywhere we would like and then when we went to sit at a medium sized table they quickly corrected us and said any small table and kept repeating them self's until we found a seat. This wouldn't have been an issue if they did so politely and originally. After sitting down we were given a menu and a pitcher of water, it doesn't seem like they have any other beverages at this restaurant which would explain why our drink order was never taken. To finish off the bad service upon ordering my girlfriend tried to order the SHIO Ramen and was rudely told that she should just order the Miso because that's what other people get and they assumed she wouldn't want the SHIO even after we spent a few minutes looking at the menu deciding.  The wait from order to getting our food wasn't too long as we got our ramen after maybe 10 minutes, the presentation on both the Miso and the Nishikawa Ramen was great, however neither ramen tasted as good as they looked. We could have gotten microwaveable ramen for much cheaper and it would have been better.  I usually like to give restaurants at least 2 shots to wow me however I will not be returning to this restaurant again.",

Nishikawa gets good reviews and is pretty close, so we gave it a try last night.  We had the vegetarian ramen, the spicy tuna appetizer and veggie spring rolls.  It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night, but we were seated immediately and the service was very good. The place has a distinct fast-food vibe; I don't mean that as a pejorative, it's just the way it is.  I don't know. I guess my overall assessment is ... OK. The food was clean and pretty fresh. It was just kind of blah. The veggie broth in the ramen literally tasted like what you'd buy at Sprouts. The noodles were good. The spring rolls were definitely frozen.  Again, it's fine. It's just not in the same category as, say, Cherry Blossom.",

The restuarant itself is pretty small so it can get crowded quickly, but you can order your food to go and they'll keep the broth seperate from the noodles so they don't get mushy! This location is still pending it's liquor application so not sure how prices on that will be yet. A good price for food based on the portion size.",

I called for an order for pick up and asked for a side of rice instead of noodles because I am gluten free for health reasons. They told me that they are not making any rice because they were closing early (I called an hour before the advertised closing time). I asked why they were closing early when picking up my order and they said because they \"weren't busy\" even though they had several pick up orders other than mine waiting...... Food was good but the customer service was a 1 out of 10 in every way. They were even talking negative about me while I was in the restaurant.",

    "text": "*4.50* Best ramen I've eaten in Phx so far. Started with some apps: chicken kara age, geso, and tako yaki. Kara age was nice and crispy, geso wasn't bad either, but compared to the motherland (Japan) would have preferred the thicker legs, tako yaki was as expected (we asked if they were freshly made the traditional way, but no). Still they were presented the traditional way and tasty. More importantly all the apps were served hot! The tonkotsu ramen was just a little to oily for my taste. Nonetheless still had bold deep flavor! Wife and my son had the black ramen, great flavor again!Daughter had the veggie ramen, soup was a little bland but hey it was veggie. Would I go back? You betcha!!! Thanks Nishikawa Ramen.",

Our waiter took awhile to get to us and the food took even longer. It's definitely a cozy place for one or two. I don't see them accommodating large parties. As far as food, would 100% recommend.",

The employees are so welcoming and radiate such a positive atmosphere within, definitely enjoy returning back to fill up my stamp card for the free bowl of ramen!!!",
