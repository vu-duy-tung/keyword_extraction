I wanna give it more stars because the food is not bad (not great tho) but the price just doesn't add up for what they give you. 2 pita sandwiches probably should cost $20. Chicken salad probably should be $12. Also I hate being nickel and dime'd for small stuff like 75 cents to add tomatoes. Plenty of other gyro spots that are just as good for cheaper.",

They are so tasty and different then #BasicBitchFries. I've been telling all my friends to go for awhile now so needed to write a review to tell the Yelpians to go!",

The vegetarian pita was so filling- large with grilled tomatoes, green peppers and onion.  You have to try the Greek fries- they tasted just like Greek roasted potatoes- with the added zing of some feta on top.  My husband said it tasted like a Greek wedding!  The gyros platter was plenty of food to split between too people.  The toasted pita that came with all meals were delish!

The souvlaki has a really good flavor to it. You'd be hard pressed to find a Greek restaurant that'll have as good of food for the price. It's the same prices pretty much as pita jungle, but better food. The ambiance is modern and goes well. Service was good and the place is clean. I will definitely come back here again.",

The lentil soup was amazing but meat was outstanding. Best gyro meat I have had in the valley. Will be returning again and may become a very frequent take out spot for me. Creative pitas and flavors too so I can't wait to try more.",

This place was tucked in the very back at a shopping plaza between Scottsdale & Tempe.  It was hard to find at first, but lucky I found this gem in time before they closed for the night.  I ordered Mediterranean Chicken Pita with Fries and my friend ordered Original Tyro Pita, also with Fries.  And since this is Greek food, Falafel appetizer is a must, so we ordered that as well.  The flavoring was very tasty, but I'm still not a fan of this type of food.  But at least I gave it a try, hopefully I\"ll have better review next time.",

In a society where we constantly have disgusting fake food pushed in our face it is nice to know there are still options out there that serve REAL food.  The service is phenomenal.  The ladies behind the counter are always very nice, even when we stroll in at 8:30pm and they close at 9pm (I'd be grumpy).  We usually dine in and the food is brought out to us in a very timely manner, usually still piping hot.  The food.  Every time I go I get the chicken picado with basmati rice. Every single time I get a tingly feeling in my loins after I eat it.  When I am balling out, I get extra chicken (more on this later).  I put some siracha on the rice and go to work.    I would probably eat here everyday if could and never get tired of it.  The ONE downfall.  Pricing.  It is decently priced for a standard meal ($7-$9).  However, if you like to spice it up and get extras you can really run up the tab.  Extra meat is $2.95 and extra veggies etc is $0.95.  Dont matter doe Ill still go back.",

It must have been somewhere between lunch and dinner when I got there as the place was barren. Clean, not too large, and I was greeted as I walked in the door. High marks for that. The menus are high tech and on digital TV screens above your head. The cashier / owner gave me a moment to figure out what I wanted. Not being too hungry, I chose a Greek salad and some Greek fries. Both were delicious! Ordering to-go or to stay I made the assumption it would all be packaged the same, but I was wrong. Since I dine in, my food was brought to my table on China with metal silverware. It was unexpected and quite nice. I'm definitely going to go back for something more meaty. I highly recommend you do the same! Enjoy!",

My boyfriend is not too adventurous when it comes to food and trying new restaurants, but he liked this place a lot and told me he'd like to come back.  It's kind of in a weird location, we went at night and had a bit of trouble finding it right away. Also there was a person being arrested directly in front of Mika's Greek which freaked us out a bit! There weren't too many people inside, we didn't have to wait to order which was nice. I ended up getting the appetizer platter with extra falafel with no domaldes. I asked if I could get rice instead of domaldes but she said you can only really ask for more falafel. Wasn't too expensive, and was a large quantity of food! My boyfriend went for the chicken with fries (one meat one side) plate. It also came with pita and tzatziki. My platter had falafel, pita, hummus, and tzatziki. It was really good! The hummus had a great texture and flavor. Tzatziki was a bit too garlicky for me, left me with smelly breath, but it was good! The falafel had a good flavor to it, I liked it a lot. I'd be happy to come back!",

The souvlaki was overlooked, uninspired hamburger. The domaldes (stuffed grape leaves) were small and vegetarian without taste. The lentil soup was hot but low on flavor.

    "text": "Oohhh, I usually order a Greek Night Club pita with chicken, but upon feeling indecisive and learning that Mika's has online ordering...one of the meat choices listed was 1/2 chicken 1/2 gyro. Um, yes please! They had all sorts of options that you can customize with a simple click of a button (white or wheat pita? no onions? extra sauce? cut in half? etc. Boom! Done.) It even gave me a pick-up time and I received text notifications when my order was in-process and ready for pick-up. Having already paid online, I just walked in, was handed my bag, and went on my way. The whole process was very simple, convenient, and fast! Plus, I didn't have to mispronounce gyro over the phone. Hahaha. Score!   My pita was excellent ~ stuffed full of gyro, chicken, lettuce, tomato, onions, kalamata olives, tzatziki, and feta! Mmm! It was a little on the salty side, which I actually like, but just something to consider if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. The side greek salad was also very good. One of these days I'll get around to trying the lentil soup...  All in all, you can get a great, fast, filling meal here for less than $10, that you feel about eating. WIN.",

    "text": "Lately, I've been craving Greek food. And lucky for me, I've had a few opportunities in recent weeks to partake. Today, lunch at Mika's Greek was suggested by one of the quieter \"culinary co-horts\". I had no idea this awesome little joint was hiding in my backyard at the south end of Papago Plaza! Mika's is clean, modern and comfortable. They even have a Coke Freestyle dispenser. More on that later.  True to form, I ordered something \"gyro\" related. My Gyro Platter (with one meat and one side) was a generous portion and very reasonable for less than eight dollars. Lunch was filling, healthy and so tasty! I'm glad I was a creature of habit today, because it made it easier to make a decision in the face of so many options.  Now about that soda machine... Right after one of my co-workers filled his drink, the touch screen indicated that nearly all the choices were unavailable. All I had at this point was a cup of ice. An employee tried to fix this by re-booting the machine. She also offered me a bottle of Coke as an option. I declined and waited patiently, returning two more times, only to find the screen slowly re-booting. When the dispenser was working again, it was still missing about 80% of the options. However, I managed to dispense a surprisingly good Cherry Mello Yello Zero. Random, huh?  Unfortunately, when I returned for a refill, the machine looked like it was working properly, but my Cherry Coke was flat... I can't deduct a star, even after that. The food at Mika's was too good! See you again soon!",

I don't know how they consistently mess it up, it has to be one of the simplest orders.

I also had an iced tea and I have to say that their iced tea is particularly good.  The food itself was excellent, plenty of meat and good tzatziki sauce.  They even take the pits out of the olives on the salad!  This place is neat as a pin, the food is good and the service is fast and friendly.",

I'm no expert but the baklava tasted old or over done. The pastry layer was really dry, airy, and flaky and the bottom layer was hard and chewy. The flavor was like baklava I've had before so I will likely give it a better look next time before I try the baklava again as I will be back.   It could have just been that the day ate here, the oven broke and the baklava was burnt. The menu is simple and offers and great assortment of options in food and beverages. I'm a stickler for good service so where Mika's Greek would usually get 5 stars, I wish I could give 7 1/2 stars for everything else.",

Sparkling clean throughout.  I hope her boss knows how diligent she is about making the place look and smell clean.  Now to the food.  The way it works is that you go to the counter, order, pay and when it is ready they bring it to you.  We had the small platters which come with one side and pita.  Hubby had the greek chicken with the Greek salad.  I had the chicken souvlaki with french fries.  The greek chicken was chopped up chicken which made it a bit dry.  The Greek salad was good as were the pitas which accompanied each platter.  The chicken souvlaki was more like a shish-kabob, nice and juicy,  so mine was the better of the two dishes.  We also got a small side of yogurt which is traditional to Greek cuisine.   The young lady was friendly, the place was clean and the pricing was fair.  I would choose the chicken souvlaki over the greek chicken anytime.   It's worth a repeat visit.",

We ate outside because, it was a beautiful day. Not too hot yet. We ordered our food and then took a seat outside. Intending to go back in to collect our plates. One of the ladies was nice enough to bring it out to us. I got the gyro and lentil soup. I only got the soup because Alan said he really liked it. I really liked it as well! Very good, as well as very healthy. I did not get the fries because other reviews said they were cold many times. I instead got the Humus which was really good and tasted very fresh.

    "text": "ok..  so there is this George's Gyros, and one on McKellips.  I am a Greek Salad lover so get them often.  Unfortunately i have to say that the George's on McKellips does a much better Greek Salad.  Its 50 cents more, but you get a lot more salad along w/ more peppers, cucumbers and olives.  And they also throw in a yummy piece of garlic bread.  Georges on Scottsdale does have a good salad, it is just not up to par to the one you get from Mckellips.  so!  I am hoping that they will read this and raise the bar a bit :-)",

Staff was fine.  Food was fine.  Not great.  But it was fine.  I had the gyros plate.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but the flavors just weren't as robust and exciting as other Greek places.  So I can't quite say \"I\"m a fan\", but it seems to me that \"A-OK\" is a little weak.  My rating really is 3.5 stars.  I will say it was probably a bad idea to get the hummus sauce.  I should have stayed with the traditional tatziki.  That just works better with gyros, in my opinion.",

I prefer to close my eyes and point when the choosing gets too difficult.   I feel as though the guy may have been a bit frustrated with me since he began asking me what I'd like and I simply told him to make it the best way it tastes. He kept his patience and managed to pick something that was pretty tasty. I believe I ended up with humus, chicken, falafel and pita.   It was fresh, it was good. No complaints at all. If in the area and it crossed my mind, I'd go back and have some more. Will it stand out in my mind to make an extra trip? Probably not. Nonetheless, still delicious.",

I wanted a falafel pita, but only saw falafel as a platter, but the lady said it was also a pita. The menu didn't reflect that, so I wonder what else I'm missing out on.  The falafel was different, but I liked it. Maybe nuts in it? Couldn't put my finger on it. It was cooked well, and was not over-sauced. The side salad I got to go with it was fresh, and I liked the dressing. My boss got the Gyro platter or salad with gyro meat...something like that. She loves it.

I stop at this little Gyros shop in an obscure corner of Papago Plaza for the sole reason that it has a great outdoor seating spot -wide, well shaded, far enough from the street and a decent view over Skysong with a bit of the Supes peaking through.  And the food is fantastic!! I had the chicken Pita, which was astoundingly tasty, with a great salad and it's $6.25? How is that possible? And the service (I think that was George?) couldn't have been better. And the place inside is clean and bright.   Nobody could ask for more.",

I ordered a hummus duo and Greek salad. The hummus was delicious. The salad was fresh and perfectly zesty!  The restaurant quickly filled up and I realized that many people already know about this gem in south Scottsdale. I'll be back.",

We ordered the chicken platter and gyro platter- each come with two sides of your choice so we got 2 salads, rice and gyro fries for our sides! Yum!   If you're a big soda drinker, they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine with 100+ different sodas and flavor combos. I rarely order a drink and I had to get one just to try it. Vanilla Rootbeer and Vanilla Gingerale- yes please!   We just moved to this side of town and I can't wait to go back again :)",

I was incredibly surprised, I eat here at least weekly and if I was on vacation I'd eat there daily. Everything is delicious!",

Food was pretty decent, have had better for the price. The lady at the cash register was friendly, and there is a bench by the entrance setup specifically for to-go patrons. I may give this place another chance next time I am in Scottsdale.",

Never had anything bad here though. Been here multiple times and I will keep returning. Like it better than the other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in the neighborhood. They're fairly quick too. Good gyros and Greek salad!",

    "text": "WOW. I am sitting here with a full belly, absolutely impressed with the meal I just had. Fresh, flavorful and not too heavy. If I hadn't eaten like a million of the french fries, it would probably pass as healthy.  The owner was really nice and my to-go order was up quickly. It's right next to British Open Pub, so I can see a few post-drink meals happening in my future!   Oh, the hummus was AMAZING. When I saw it I expected it to be a little gritty and bland, but it was anything but. It has a great flavor but not too lemony or garlicy. Can't put my finger on exactly what is so awesome about it, but it is. Actually, even now as I'm as uncomfortably full as I am, I'm thinking about having another bite of it...",

They gave a generous portion of gyro meat as well as sauces. We took it to go, but the restaurant was very clean when we picked it up. The girl who rang us up was super nice and made small talk while I waited. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu :)",

    "text": "Three of us went at 5pm Saturday before Valentine's Day.  We wanted a place that wouldn't be inundated with celebrants, one that was a locally owned one and someplace we haven't been before.  Mika's Greek fit the bill perfectly!               First impression:  just like so many Yelp reviews, it was hard to find.  I thought there was a Mediterranean place on the west side of the plaza... nope... there was a pizza place that has a huge ad for GYROS in the front window.  That was misleading.  The man there, helped us when we asked where Mika's was and he kindly pointed.  We will have to stop there for pizza sometime, since he did help us find it.  Mika's is on the south part of Papago Plaza, next to the British Pub.      Second impression:   CLEAN!  It was a crisp clean interior design and modern.  I really liked it.      Next:  We were to order at the front  counter and they would bring it to us.  A little awkward with one of us with a cane, and having never been there... but we were just new to the place.... next time will be easy peasy.        Next:   WOWOWOWOW the food was great!  We ordered the Greek Sampler and my favorite part was the hummus, tzatziki and pita.  Very quickly after that, our entrees arrived.  Each of us had ordered pitas.  The chicken caesar pita was said to have really tender delicious chicken... the Original pita was yummy with extra tzatziki... and the Diablo pita was very much enjoyed by our friend.  The pitas come with a side.   Our choices of rice and salad worked very well with our pitas.      Desert was very very tempting, but with having had the sampler before the meal, we look forward to having the honey walnut baklava another time.   I would highly recommend going.",
