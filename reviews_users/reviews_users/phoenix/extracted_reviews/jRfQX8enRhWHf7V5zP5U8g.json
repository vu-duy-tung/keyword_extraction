I've been to Italy a number of times and always get chocolate gelato everywhere I go there. When I try to find the same quality and flavor of chocolate gelato in the US I find it near impossible to find. But this shop hits it spot on! This place has chocolate gelato that tastes just like the real thing in Italy. It's based on dark chocolate so don't expect it to taste like milk chocolate ice cream. Being a gelato, the flavor will be bold. This place delivers on that!!  I would definitely recommend you stop here for some great pizza and then some gelato!!!",

All the flavors are perfectly balanced... while you get that nice full feeling from eating carbs, there's none of that greasy mess.   The service is always so friendly.

They have a bunch of great toppings and different types of cheeses, my favorite of course being prosciutto.  Pizza was kinda soggy, which surprised me with being a wood fired oven? The kitchen also messed up and we got our pizza before our appetizer.  The server was gracious and comped it for us without us even saying a word, which was the right thing to do.  I will give this place another shot for pizza and to try different types of gelato!  Give it a shot, maybe just got them on a bad day.",

Pluses: they actually have good selection of vegan gelatos - had the chocolate coconut milk, was D-Lish -- perfect/not too sweet!!  Love sitting in the glass front area overlooking the street, it's dimly lit, offering cute comfy pillows to lounge on where we could enjoy our sweet treats, as we watch the world go by... And have to mention - the bathrooms are some of the nicest facilities around-modern, attractive and ALWAYS clean...

The location is perfectly central, so it doesn't matter where you had dinner - this is always \"on the way\" home and always worth every bite.   Their gelato flavors are mostly standard, although the seasonal flavors and chef-inspired creations have been really impressive. Of course you'd expect a pumpkin gelato around the holidays, but it was so delicious I had a hard time keeping it to one scoop! I have yet to meet a flavor I dislike, but I don't anticipate that happening.  After all, you can sample as many choices as your sweeth tooth desires before committing to just one delicious flavor or combine for the perfect heavanly dessert (if you have room, which I never do). Even their coffee is exceptional and totally hits the spot on cooler winter nights.  The vibe is energetic and laid back at the same time: everyone is just coming here for that near coma-inducing sugary, creamy indulgence and in no rush to end a perfectly enjoyable night. It's incredible that as busy as it gets the staff can maintain so much patience and be so friendly while doling out countless samples. While I haven't tried anything from their lunch/dinner menu, their dessert/coffee/wine are plenty to keep this girl as a regular.",

The portions are small - as expected and all you need- the service was so-so, and the place wasn't busy inside. While you *can* ask for free samples, more than a couple samples seems frowned upon.  After the raving yelp reviews I was thinking this place would be magical or something. It's normal gelato, the way its served in hundreds of places across the country. Nothing out of the ordinary, and a little more costly.  I recommend the Chai gelato. Just don't sit outside in the AZ summers or it'll melt in a quarter of the time! :)   Frankly, I'd save the money and buy a pint at Fry's to split with friends!",

I couldn't choose between vanilla bean and caramello, so I ended up getting two flavors (and believe me, narrowing it down to two took a while as they have a lot of enticing flavors).  Oh yes, and after dealing with the prices at Coldstone for a few years now it was a welcome relief and pleasant surprise that gelato for two only cost about $6.",

We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, that's for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.  The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didn't finish it again. I don't know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those.",

Immediately checked it on Yelp and saw it had a great rating, and then we found out why.The gelato here was excellent, and we have had our share of gelato in many places. Flavor choices were very good. Some flavors like Samoa and Roche I had never seen. I had Samoa and my husband had the Roche, which was delicious and tasted like hazelnut. Would definitely go back there to try another flavor or even the pizza we saw being made that looked great.",

    "text": "My family and I did a trip to Italy years ago (think Griswolds without all the chaos, well just hint of chaos). I had my first taste of and developed quite a crush on gelato while there. My brother and I have this running joke regarding gelato, because whenever we went exploring on our own, he misjudged his directions and we ended up lost (er, farther than where we were supposed to be). I became cranky like a little kid and to \"get me to be quiet\" and make up for us wandering around, he would buy me gelato. Yes, I have a great older brother. Anyway... before my parents and I came into town, he mentioned The Gelato Spot and wanted to take us here.   Oh man. I was in heaven as soon as I walked in. It's a cute place with really comfy lounge-like chairs. There is plenty of seating outside too, but it was just too hot for me to sit out there. The Gelato Spot offer a variety of flavors and gelato mixture drinks (which I did not try but was tempted). The staff greeted us as soon as we walked in and was patient as I paced up and down trying to decide what I wanted. I tried a sample of the peanut butter. It was good, but not something I really wanted. I could not decide what to pair it with other than chocolate. I'm not very good at pairing stuff, so I stuck with my usual mint chocolate chip and added in a scoop of cookies and cream. Yummy in my tummy, I tell ya. My brother and I enjoyed our desserts, but our mom was not thrilled with the coffee flavored gelato. She said it was good but not as good as she hoped.   PS: They have free wifi! Gelato and wifi = excellent.",

Ben loves the peanut butter, chocolate with peanut butter cups added in. I must say I would have given this 5 stars but out of over a dozen visits I have only had one nice counter person. That was on Tuesday night, May 5. A young woman was working with him as well and was very friendly. Also, the passion fruit sorbeto was paradise!   One visit a girl was incredibly rude to a guest by ignoring him just before serving me. All he wanted was a glass of water and she made him wait. I was so turned off. She actually said to me in front of the guest \"some people don't know how to wait their turn\". I told her I didn't mind but she ignored my request as well. The next visit the young man seemed disgusted for guests to come in at 9:30 p.m. when they are open until 10 p.m. during the week. What else do you have to do for 30 minutes. I got the impression \"my parents made me get a job\". Good luck with your future kiddo.",

Here on vacation for a few days and my boyfriend decided to show me around downtown Scottsdale. It was late and most places in the downtown were closed, so we hit the Gelato Spot for a little dessert.   This place is clean and cute and pretty close to the downtown area. The staff are very attentive and greet you when you come in. They are happy to give you samples of anything and everything you want. I feel guilty trying too many, but I made sure to try a few. I could not believe the number of choices. It seemed like far more than there ever were at the gelato stops in italy and the few that stops I have been to in my area too. LOTS OF CHOICES. Some that I have seen before and a handful of new ones. I opted to try the pumpkiin nad the oatmeal raisin. Both were delicious. So I got the oatmeal raisin and my boyfriend got the pumpkin and vanilla. That way, I get to have both without ordering a double.   YUMMY!!! Great quality gelato. Great Service. Super cute place with inside couches and outside patio. Seems like it would be perfect on a hot AZ summer day!",

I had heard so much about their new bar from friends, I thought I'd check it out.. It was slow, maybe a total of 7 people in the whole place. I was greeted by one girl, I ordered a scotch with a glass of water. She never returned. A second girl greeted me, I did the same order, she left as if to grab my order. She too did not return. A third girl approached and asked if I'd been helped, I said \" I think so, but I've been waiting 15 mins for a scotch and a water\" she replied that she'd find out \"what's going on\" and on this hot day I really wanted a water while I waited. I stared at the bottle of scotch whiskey just beyond arms length, wondering why this was so hard for them to do. I turned around in my seat to see the first girl looking at paperwork at a register and the other two nowhere in sight. I left and will never return. If you want good gelato or ice-cream, even alcoholic beverages, go somewhere like LGO or Churn instead. This place is generic, poorly run and in my opinion a waste",

I ended up getting the vegan coconut which was excellent! Light, creamy, refreshing and it had bits of actual coconut in it.  I was so amazed at how they made it so creamy without using milk. I also got a scoop of the raspberry sorbet, but it wasn't a very good combo with the coconut bc it tasted too sour and tangy in comparison.   I also like that it's connected to a pizza place. A perfect one stop shop for a night out. There was plenty of comfortable seating in the dining area and it was quiet enough to easily hold a conversation. Also there was lots of interesting people watching for all the people going in and out of the bar upstairs. I'll definitely be back for more vegan gelatos the next time I'm in the area!",

I got my usual salad order to go - the Cobb, with the champagne vinaigrette - with no cucumbers.  What I received was a salad that contained pieces of wilted spring mix thrown in with the regular romaine and spring lettuce, chicken (some pieces grilled perfectly, some burnt), 3/4 cup of cucumbers, bacon, blue cheese, and a warm hard boiled egg.  No Tomato or Chives made it on my salad.    The wilted lettuce, burnt chicken pieces, and warm egg were a total turnoff.  And picking the cucumber out was a PITA.  I think it will be a while before I return here for lunch.",

    "text": "This place... hm, mixed feelings.  On quality, availability of seating, street view and curb appeal is place is doing quite well. Areas they could improve however include parking availability, staff friendlies, prices and vibe. I love gelato, almost exclusively over ice cream and I always correct people if they interchange the nouns. This location has a wonderful variety and always tastes great even if it's a flavor I normally don't like... being inside Woodfire is an added bonus.  Although, I am left a little peeved by the staff walking up and down the stairs behind The Gelato Spot counter staring at me. I'll be talking with a scooper/cashier and every time I'm there I feel eyes glaring at me behind her head... If I knew it was a problem with me in particular or a misjudged look I'd resend that complaint, but after the 4th time it's just bizarre. The prices are fairly high, leaving me to buy gelato at the grocery store more often now, which is why I too miss the groupons. They were the only reason I knew it or Woodfire existed. Now onto the parking, the lot would be more effective if sports car(s), owned by I'm assuming the up and/or down owner(s) at the closet and most effective for handicaps spaces, weren't there.",

As someone who lived in Sicily for years, I am pretty particular about my pizza, and gelato. I must say, the crust was amazing! The ingredients were authentic, and the gelato was top notch. Unfortunately, the service and decore left a lot to be desired. It seems ownership shot their wad on the prime location and wood burning stove, leaving nothing left for a quality staff. All staff members that night were high school girls, who had no concept of customer service. We were exposed to general complaints of having to work, why so and so can be late but they couldn't... on and on. Also, while preparing my gelato, a whole scoop was dropped into another flavors bin, which was quickly scooped up and put back into my container. gross. For authentic sicilian pizza, I give them 2 thumbs up. For all around experience, It was massively lacking. UPDATE: I was quickly contacted by the owner, who was very interested in my experience, and wanted my opinion on how to better his business. I respect the hell out of that. I am upping my rating to 4 stars. Thanks again!",

The problem with it all is that now its confusing, there are 2 registers and a \"wait staff\" to bring you the food, but the drink is self-serve and you have to pay at one of the registers.    There may be no better way to do this, but if they can figure out a better way to make it work a bit more streamlined and less confusing for new customers it would be a boon.",

I was pleasantly surprised to see they had food as well; a decent selection of salads, paninis, and pizza.  My friend ordered a salad, which was huge, and looked very good.  I ordered a grilled cheese, which blew my mind!  Granted, I have a special weakness for grilled cheese, but the choice of cheese, and ripe tomatoes on this were definitely spot on.    I wasn't going to order gelato (how wrong would that be, to go here and not try some!), but my friend talked me into it.  I have to agree with another reviewer who said the gelato was too rich.  I'm glad I ordered the small, because it was super rich and super sweet...a little too much for my liking.  That being said, so far this is the best gelato I've found in the area; you'd be amazed at what some places try to pass off as gelato.  There ought to be a law!",

I was a little confused going in on how things worked. The short version? Order your pizza at the register by the oven, fill your own drinks with the exception of coffee which will be brought out to you. Find a seat with your number and wait for deliciousness to be brought to your table.   We all enjoyed our pizza's and the Gelato was amazing. Pumpkin pie was sooooo good.   I do have to say we were a little apprehensive going in, it isn't what you would think of when you think of good pizza, it looks like a brightly lit ice cream parlor more than a sit down pizza place, but really it is both.   Next time I am in that part of town, I will for sure stop for a Gelato, there are so many choices and so little time.",

We tried their Classic Pizza and were pleasantly surprised. In places we have visited in Italy, the pizza crust is more important than the toppings, and the Spot has done the crust justice in their wood fired oven. That with simple, fresh toppings makes it even better - ours had a wonderful cheese, olive oil, mushrooms and sausage -  with each flavor being discernible in each bite.  We split the pizza so we had lots of room left for two scoops of gelato. Always consistently good - no ice crystals as we have experienced with gelato places in Chandler. And full flavored - even in Italy some shops can skimp on flavorings to save a few euros.  But alas, no Mediterranean views. But with great gelato and what I think is a pizza done one better, this place will be continue to be on our short list of favorites.  6/12/2012  I had to update my pizza review after 2 more visits. We had one with pepperoni that had a distinctive off taste - and resulted in stomach pangs but no other ill effects. And the last time we repeated the Classic but it was what I would describe as soupy and lacking the balance of flavors that we loved when we first tried it.   Still, we still do love the way they do gelato and will return for the tiramisu and pistachio flavors.",

Not only is their gelato my favorite of all places around Phoenix/Scottsdale (try their seasonals - my fav was Canteloupe) they now serve phenomenal light lunch food.  First time we did lunch, I tried the margherita pizza, and the italian panini (ask for it warm).  mmm mmm....  mozzarella, proscuitto, home-grown basil... everything is so fresh!   I've now been back to try out their salads, paninis and other pizzas.    This location is more touristy, but its worth a visit for a nice lunch and a yummy treat!",

We ordered 2 types of pizza, a side salad, and sampled some Gelato. Of course the Gelato was delish, but I can finally say I have found a place in Old town who makes a GOOD small salad that doesnt charge an arm & a leg. I am so glad to have finally found a good spot to eat, that is also open late. The only improvement I could see being made...delivery to local businesses :-)",

I don't really care for ice cream. But this is where i was mistaken, cuz gelato is not ice cream! There were so many flavors... I think i made the girls behind the counter a lil batty with my indecision and fawning over the potential flavor combinations... I finally settled on a choc-dipped waffle cone with Caramello and Tiramisu flavors. Yum. Yum. Yum!  I promise i will try a different flavor next time, but it will be hard to resist that Tiramisu... I will be back!!",

I showed the girl at the counter and she offered to give me a new one, but she did NOT remove the batch of that flavor from the case.

It's an Italian coffee, that for whatever odd reason, I haven't seen served anywhere else.      Often times, many Marriott hotels will serve the Italian brand of \"illy\"  [Also excellent but not as good as this], but the Pascucci proves to be elusive.    Last time I was in Phoenix, I dragged some coworkers on a 20 minute drive to have coffee and Gelato at this location.  With that much hype, you'd think no way this lives up to expectation.  This place did.     If you happen to be in Scottsdale, give it a try.  If you're on a diet, put it on hold, and have yourself a giant mound of delicious gelato and Pascucci coffee.   Go with some good friends.  Your taste buds will appreciate it, and for less than 10 Dollars, you can have a slice of some of the best things in life over conversation with a few good friends.",

My workmates love the gelato here but I do not. The reason: It tastes too much like premium ice cream. Too rich. Gelato is SUPPOSED to be made with a lesser fat milk and although it is denser than ice cream, that only should mean that the flavor is stronger. I am a gelato lover, but I do not enjoy the gelato here. It's not bad, but it's just not what I'm used to.  I've also had the food here (yes, there's food!). They make AWESOME paninis!  So for me... it's a 50/50. Don't hate it. Don't love it.",

Every cup comes with a pirouette--very unique!    My only gripe:  You can't purchase two flavors in a small cup. Only medium.  Not that I'm complaining about having MORE scrumptious gelato...

I'm more of a fruity person so I always opt for a fruity option. When I was in Italy I went on a gelato eating spree- breakfast, lunch and dinner. And this place reminded me of why I wanted gelato because it's oh so delicious. I went for the some kind of berry mix (as usual) and it was delicious! My friend got the thin mints gelato and that was OMG good! It was a perfect balance between the actual thin mints and the vanilla. One thing was I felt the portions were smaller for the price. I believe it was like $4 ish and the scoop of gelato was stingier than others I've been too. It was deceiving because it looks round and full at the top but there's nothing down in the bottom ... boohoo.   Oh another thing I liked about this place was you can sit on the patio and people watch, they have misters so you won't get hot. Also one of the few gelato places that is actually well ventilated.",

There has been much less attitude and better  service by the staff on my recent visits to the G-Spot, and for that they get my thanks and my gelato dollars.

Every single time I have been there the food I call in is NEVER ready. They always tell me it will be 15-20 minutes when I call in, so I time it so I get there in the time alloted. I have learned that it typically won't be ready, so I will wait the entire 20 minutes before I even start driving over. Every time I arrive the food hasn't even been started! This last time I came in, the same exact thing, the food hadn't even been started, but in addition to that, they were out of bacon and prosciutto (which was on all three sandwiches I ordered). It would have been nice if someone would have told me before I showed up, or maybe even called back. The worst part is I waited an additional  25 minutes on top of my \"quoted\" time!!! At that point I figured they would have offered free gelato... but instead i got a $4 pizza card for the inconvenience,  which was at the register for anyone to grab. I don't think I will return after the continuous lack of service. Truly disappointed.",

The waitress tells us they no longer use prosciutto, OK, so they asked if regular ham is acceptable.  I said it was.  This pizza had ABSOLUTELY no flavor.

I got the iced Nutella latte and holy wow! It's a blend of hazelnut and almond syrups with a little chocolate I think. It was definitely one of the best tasting coffees I've had in quite a while. The coffee they used was really smooth and fresh. There was no bitter aftertaste that you frequently get with certain coffee shops. I think this business is connected in some way to the Second Story Liquor Bar located above them. We were waiting for a table upstairs to have a drink and Lori was very attentive. She gave us some details about the bar and showed us a menu. She also made sure that the hostess knew we were still waiting and helped us get seated after she found out we had been waiting an extra 15 minutes after the estimated wait time. Great place and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottdale. :)",

When my boyfriend and I were ready to order she was rudely on her phone texting I said excuses me 3 times and she ignored me repeatedly so I had walk up right infront of her face and ask if she could take my order. My boyfriend ordered two scoops and got half of one and I got less than that. I've never experienced this type of horrible service and I've been coming here for years. After I asked for a manager the rude lady behind the counter said she was the manager and I could call whoever I wanted. I will never come back ever again.",

    "text": "I think its time to update my review. As board exams come closer, I have been frequenting this place more and more as my study spot. I've been downing gelato shakes, sandwiches and pizza left and right and putting on some much need poundage. Before I review the food, I just want to mention that the biggest thing since I started coming here years ago is the customer service. The service here has immensely improved since last year and I am thankful for it. The staff is super friendly and helpful and really attentive to the customer. I do not think they are taking their brand for granted anymore - it is a nice turnaround! Also in my previous review, I questioned the layout, but I rescind that opinion. I like it now, its grown on me. It appears more spacious and there seems to be an upstairs that will eventually be opening. I like the fact they have electrical outlets all around and three different areas for you to settle down in. This location really does accommodate a variety of customers from the student to the family of 4 who is ready for a treat.  my favorite salad: the focaccia chop salad with chicken: comes with cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, diced cucumbers, avacado all on top of baked focaccia flatbread.  this is just the most refreshing thing you can eat on a summer afternoon. i do wish there was a tad more chicken...they dice the chicken up so small that its a little tough to get a good bite using a fork.   best hot panini: bbq chicken sandwich w/o bacon - wood fired chicken with chipotle bbq sauce and onions...flavorful and filling.   i would suggest staying away from the grilled cheese panini. It isn't the typical grilled cheese we all think about it - it's got mozarella, provolone, gorgonzola....for some reason i decided to go wild and get something new and i knew i should have after my second bite. just not my thing.  best cold panini: sometimes you gotta go with something simple and this is the way to go. the oregano and olive oil mixed into this sandwich was done right.  best pizza: bufala: mozarella, basil, oregano, tuscan olive oil...one of the few pizzas i enjoy sans meat. all the food here is filling except for the pizza. i can get through a pizza and still feel my stomach grumbling. definitely a good item if you're only a little hungry, but if you think about sharing 1 pizza - be prepared to be ordering in another 5 minutes.",

There was a big selection of interesting, delicious sounding flavors; I decided upon the almond Snickers.  My gelato was awesome. The texture was creamy and there was chocolate and caramel swirls with chocolate and almond pieces.  I love Snickers and although it did not remind me of a Snickers bar, it had great flavors and I had no complaints.  I also enjoyed the pirouette, it added a good crunch to the dessert.  Great place, super tasty, eat with their little spoon, and savor the flavors... it's a little on the pricey side (in my opinion). But, this may be the going rate for quality gelato.",

The service was friendly and casual and great for those on a time crunch because you can order at the counter, grab a seat and wait to be served!  On this visit we both ordered the Focaccia Chop salad with chicken. With the Arizona heat in full effect crisp salads are what I crave most, and that salad sure hit the spot! The mix of Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, wood roasted corn, diced cucumber carrots and avocado was heavenly. The champagne vinaigrette added a hint of sweetness that blended nicely with Grana Padano cheese that was served over the greens. The best part was that the salad was served over their fresh oven baked Focaccia bread! It was almost like a pizza salad and I enjoyed every bite!  In addition to delicious food and generous portions, the prices are super reasonable! I don't think I saw anything on the menu that was over $10.95. As I waited for my salad,  I read over their other menu offerings and I will for sure come back for a taste of their wood-fired pizza, panini and Gelato!",

It is a small size by most restaurant measurements in NY style, to pick up a slice whole could not be done without it falling apart.  It obviously wasn't appetizing and flavor wise was a massive BLEAH.  SIDE SALAD - largely consisted of chop lettuce, with two small tomatoes, two carrot slices and some shave cheese added.  Three scoops were packed together in the same container, three very different favors that unfortunately were just okay.  Can't imagine coming back or recommending to anyone.",

Another thing I really like about the G Spot is the crazy amount of flavors to choose from. They offer a variety of fruit, European, and American choices which are all excellent.

She picked out the two flavors online and I filled out the order form and took it to the store along. Well, they didn't have the flavors she picked out, which were listed online - no mention that you should check availability. So I picked out two other flavors & placed the order. My other daughter picked it up 3 days later. Unfortunately we did not realize until we cut the stupid thing that it was NOT buttercream frosting but whipped cream- which my daughter HATES.  This is 2014 and company websites are now your storefront, so make sure the info is accurate and up to date!! When I called to complain, prior to leaving review here, I was told that there wasn't a manager in the store but they would have him call me back. It is now 5 days later and I still haven't heard from back from anyone.  I gave them a chance to resolve this issue and they blew that too.  WON't BE BACK.",

Dessert: Mint Chocolate Chip Gelato Basically a girl scout cookie turned into gelato. They have 30+ flavors and a few seasonal ones.   Service: unbelievably slow, especially since it was myself and one other person. It took 20 minutes to get my check, another 15 to get my card back.  I'm the type of person that can never choose the type of pizza I want, so I always ask to make it half and half. I was told absolutely not an option. I was on my way out and overheard the table next to me order a pizza with a half and half combo and the same waitress agreed to it! How was that fair? Major disappointment that the group next to me go better service than I did.  The menu itself is great, lots of great options for lunch and dinner. I really liked the indoor/outdoor seating. They have a coffee and wine bar. The coffee smelled unbelievably delicious and I was sitting across the restaurant from the bar.   Overall, great food, dessert, and vibe.",

We visited on a weekday around 3pm, kinda slow but we were greeted right away by our server which was helpful and very attentive. She answered any questions we had on the pizzas and we finally opted on the Honey Basil (AMAZING!) and the Veggie. The pizzas were great but my absolute fave was the honey basil, what unique flavors. Of course we had to save room for Gelato, they had so many flavors I went to go check them out myself at the counter and tried a couple and then our server brought them out for us, absolutely delightful. It was a lovely afternoon late lunch on a beautiful day with great food and lovely service. Can't wait to visit again.",

We decided to stop here for lunch and we split a margarita pizza. It was actually really good. Super thin crust, really good flavor. We had gelato afterwards which doesn't really compare to what we had in Italy but that doesn't seem possible here and it was still ok. Staff here were really friendly. This guy brought his kid in for gelato while we were eating and it was the kid's 3rd birthday so they went all out making his gelato special - even found a birthday candle and put it in there for him. It's always nice to see people taking great care of their customers and these guys did a great job! We'll come back!",

I told them I would pay by cash and gave them my table number. Our delivery came within 15 minutes. The total was $27 and I gave the guy $40 since I only had $20 bills. He said he didn't have change and I said that was all I had. He could have gone back to the restaurant and brought me change, but didn't offer it and left with the money. I'm a generous person and I always tip for delivery but a $13 tip on a $27 meal is a 48.14% tip which is quite absurd. I also didn't want to make a scene since the comedians were already performing. What would have happened if I only had a $50 or $100 bill!? I felt superiorly ripped off, but since the comedians were so hilarious, I laughed my displeasure away.  The pizza and salad were okay so that's why I generously still offered 2 stars.   So if you guys plan to order delivery, you better have the exact change or be prepared to pay an enormous tip for a delivery that may not be worth it.",

To start, we got the capriciossa pizza. It was absolutely delicious! It took a while to come out even though it wasn't too busy in the restaurant, however it was worth the wait. The crust was crispy and the toppings tasted really fresh. I'd definitely drive back there just for this!  After we were done with the pizza, we also got a couple of gelatos. They were super nice in offering samples which we took them up on. I ended up getting the Roasted Almond one & it was really tasty! Not only that, but it was also really light & airy. I believe that dessert goes to the place in  your stomach that doesn't exist which means you can have has much as you want ... right? Anyways, for this as well, we will be back!",

Peppy employee let me sample to my heart's desire (just two flavors) and I ordered two: the Pockett coffee and the roche. Both good but the coffee was the real winner with chocolate chunks, so delicious. I wouldn't order the roche again but would do a classic chocolate. Their gelato displays are always so beautiful and they've got a great selection. I always go for chocolate so my choices are narrowed but they have fruity flavors and vegan options as well.

The employees take their time with each customer, in case you want to try EVERY SINGLE FRIGGIN FLAVOR like the customer in front of me.  And, they do it with a smile.  I wouldn't have been as patient as The Gelato Spot employees.  I guess that's why they're there and I am on the other side of the counter.    But if the only downside I see to The Gelato Spot is that their customer service is superior, I suppose there is nothing to complain about.  Of course, they could use more parking... especially since whenever I am in the mood they seem to be PACKED.  But the gelato is seriously delicious and even worth the $ you shell out for it.    I have not tried anything other than the gelato, but after reading the reviews here... I will be sure to try the pizza or a panini next time!",

I really enjoyed my Toasted Almond and Coconut. YUM. It came with a long cookie which was a nice touch.   You've gotta know what you want when you get up there.

Especially when you bring in an indecisive teenager who goes through 20 spoons of sampling.   Reasonably priced, and the new decor is nice. Miss the old patio, though. It was nice sitting outside in the fall.   Their wood-fired pizzas are good. But can be hit or miss. Ask them for a crispy crust and it won't be undercooked and soggy like some people complain about. I like the Primavera (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Arugula, Prosciutto, Olive Oil, Shaved Grana Padano) and the Esotica (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Fresh Pineapple, Italian Ham, Basil, Tuscan Olive Oil). LOVE IT!!   If you're thinking of going on a weekend, order ahead online! It will save you time in line and the headache of waiting! Bon appetit!",

Meaning if you want 2 scoops, one of the scoops can't be one of those 3 flavors. You can get 2 scoops of he same flavor but who wants to do that? I found that odd and annoying but hey it's for charity, I think.   They offer pizza and salads and have a separate coffee bar. Yep...  I am for sure going back for next months elvis flavor though.",

If you haven't been here recently, it's changed from a place where you could go order pizza or a sandwich at the counter and then sit down to a traditional restaurant where you sit down and order ... but then you still have to get up and order gelato at the counter.  I hear they might be changing it around in the coming months, so I'm not sure if their identity crisis is a good thing or a bad thing.

I have [thoroughly] enjoyed the gelato several times, taking advantage of their late hours walking around old town. It has never disappointed, whether I was in a fruity mood (mango and pineapple) or a chocolately indulgent mood (nutella and caramello).   What I didn't know until recently, and what inspired me to finally yelp this place, is the fact that they serve FOOD! And get this- it's GOOD. They have a big, beautiful wood firing oven and they use it to make fresh, authentic Italian style pizzas and flatbread. I, still feigning a \"diet\", decided to partake in the chopped salad. Loaded with fresh veggies, it's tossed in a tasty dressing and served on a wood fired flat bread. I was in salad heaven. I also tried the pizza, which was delicious and extremely flavorful. You could tell everything was made from scratch- plus, you got to watch it being made. No re-heated cardboard tasting pizza here!  I can't wait to go back and try more of the Pizzas, particularly the BBQ chicken one, which came highly recommended. Obviously, you have to finish your meal with some of their famous gelato. This time, I had salted caramel and chocolate peanut butter. Totally diet friendly, right? Oh well. I'll call it a cheat day.",

So my expectations weren't very high when it came to service. But you would think having to only scoop Gelato it would be a simple task even a kid could do. My first attempt here I asked for a double scoop in a medium bowl and I was served two medium bowls with one flavor in each. My second attempt I asked for a large bowl with two scoops. I went for the large this time because I did enjoy the Gelato.  But I was served a medium with two very small scoops. I guess asking for two scoops in a large bowl confused the girl as a large would normally come with three scoops and the small portion was so they could put a lid. My suggestion would be go right down the street to the Sugar Bowl which had great service great ice cream with no attitude from their employees when you ask them to fix the mistake.",

    "text": "Good lunch & dinner food and great food prices during happy hour, and good choices of vegetarians. I got the Foccacio Chop Salad and thought it was pretty good.  I really liked the foccacio on the bottom - it was quite thin (same as their pizzas) and topped with a delicious oil herb blend. The salad itself was fine, I would have liked more \"fat\" in it (cheese and avocado), but it was still good. The dressing was a delicious lemon oil/vinegar blend - very light and refreshing without the heaviness/sourness of normal balsamic. My husband had the meatball panini and liked it a lot - great sauce, great meatballs, good wood-fired bread. There are tons of different gelato flavors, for every mood, so it's hard to go wrong there.  The only bad part of the experience was the service. I came in on a Wednesday at 5 and the place was deserted, just 2 other tables with people. I sat waiting for a menu for at least 10 minutes, while politely making eye contact with all of the servers yet no one came over, until I got it myself. Server took a long time to take our order and when the food was done it sat (visible to us) for minutes and minutes. At this point I knew we're in for bad service so I just sat and watched, and I saw one server tell our server that the food was ready but our server kept reviewing receipts from earlier in the day. Eventually the food was brought over, the order was incorrect, and the server takes it back and says to the chef \"well she allegedly ordered XYZ\". Allegedly...I'm a polite and nice person and sort of expect the same in return. I hope this experience was an anomaly because it seemed the other tables were being waited on well (by a different server) so maybe I just got someone having an off day. If the service hadn't been such an affront after a long day at work, 4 stars.",

I was thinking tha t this was mainly a large array of Gelato flavors to choose from; boy was I wrong! The menu was loaded with pizzas, sandwiches, salads and much more.  I opted for a sausage and peppers Pannini sandwich. May I say that the bread they used for this was fantastic! It's thin and tender and makes it a delight to eat.  The peppers and sausage had that old Italian feel and were seasoned just right. I sat in front of the restaurant that looks put my right on Scottsdale Road. It is a great observation platform for watching the many interesting people the take to the streets here.  I didn't have the Gelato when I was here. However, there were a plethora  of options to choose from. The facility is super clean and my service was excellent. I will be back soon for that Gelato! This was a great stop for lunch.

There wasn't a a strong caramel flavor but I wasn't complaining. The gelato had plenty of rich dark chocolate taste.   Recommend trying a few flavors before making a choice. There were a couple of others that looked and sounded very good. Those just didn't have as much going for them as the fudge brownie.",

So while all of my friends were excited to hit up the Sugar Bowl, I came here to cool down from the heat and enjoy a scoop of coffee gelato.  When they stuck a cookie straw into my scoop, I had to ask, \"Is this also vegan?\" \"Oh yeah, it's made with a water-based chocolate.\"  Might not be a good enough answer for some people, but it floated my boat.  Yay for gelato!  Yay for cookie straws!  It's everything you want gelato to be, without some other mama's milk.",

It had a great looking gelato bar to select and sample from but first, we sat down in the main area and ordered the 12\" Testarossa pizza which we shared and gobbled up: thin crust, fresh made and tasty!  We were stuffed but then needed gelato and ordered a trifecta of delish flavors: raspberry, almond snickers and stracciatella. This place has a small bar area with video screens (nice), a comfortably sized dining space with cozy booths right by the gelato and pizza making area, and a step down area into another room with a wide corner street view (this space looked good for families).  I liked that you had a choice where to sit (space permitting).  Ambiance, lighting, and service was above par. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

My only knock would be that sometimes they don't spread out the sauce and toppings as much as I'd like so there is a lot of crust... and let's face it -- pizza is all about the sauce and cheese and toppings!",

Pulling into the back they have a pretty good amount of parking for a restaurant in this section of town.  We were greeted by a cheerful cashier and perused the menu of a wide variety of pizza choices, gelato and coffee.  They have a huge selection of gelato in a large glass ounter in the front. It was pretty impressive. It's a bright modern pizzeria inside it appeared from the outside to have an upstairs, but I didn't notice a way to get to it. We grabbed a seat in the outer dining room not noticing it was cleverly disguised out door seating.  I can't really recommend it on unusually cold days in December, but it wasn't too bad.  The pizza guy twirling the crusts on the side counter which was a pretty cool touch.  The food was a pretty good size, came out promptly,  and had a good wood fired crunchy crust with just the right amount of sauce and toppings.   I'll definitely be back for another pie and try the gelato and coffee.  Try:  - Veggie White Pizza",

Each has it's own decor going on... with this one being much more loungy with big couches and chairs all over the place.  Cool place.  But gelato is to die for. Forget Coldstone and come and get something at least halfway healthy! And better yet, it tastes phenominal.  Plus, you can stand there and bother the workers to get samples of everything they have... if you really wanted to. But, if you are like me, you get tunnel vision and order the same thing every time - Amarena.  OK, I lied. Last time I went I actually tried another flavor - Caramelo.  So now I am in a debacle... because I love both flavors. Maybe this is my chance to break routine and try yet another flavor. Hmmm, we will see... my beloved Amarena calls my name ever so strongly every time I stare through that cold case window.  Alright, I need to get going... to the G-spot!  PS - check in a few times on Yelp and get a coupon and from what I hear Foursquare has a coupon as well!",

What I like about this Italian ice cream shop is that not only does it have endless flavors of Gelato, it's also a tasty coffee shop equipped with Internet access, breakfast, beverages and frozen sweets. You can also order Gelato cakes for parties or if you're really craving ice cream and a cup just won't do.   Gelato Spot opens bright and early in the morning, but you're not forced to have Gelato for breakfast. I've tried their breakfast sandwich and fruit/granola combo and both are excellent. Their coffee selection is hearty and they even have Italian sodas on hand. But, mostly I heart the Gelato Spot for their creamy and delicious Gelato. It's equivalent to the Gelato I've had in Italy and they even throw in a tasty cookie with every cup.   Whether I'm there to lounge for a little bit or do some work, the atmosphere is always welcome and friendly. I'm sure I'll be a regular there this summer.",

    "text": "I remember as kid my older sister would drive me to one of the only gelato places in town in old town Scottsdale. I don't think this was it, but I know it's near the same area. Old Town has changed so much over the years. I remember when they tore down the Kachina theater (where I saw E.T.) to put up the forever abandoned Galleria. I remember when they tore down my favorite hot dog joint and put up a Gilbert Ortega behind the cowboy sign.  Anyway - even though this probably isn't the same gelato place I vaguely remember as a kid and it's totally modern inside, it still makes me feel nostalgic. It's a great place to stop by if you're walking around downtown and want a cold treat. It's an even better place to get dinner. This location serves wood-fired pizza, salads, and sandwiches as well.  I have been here a bunch of times, but recently had some lunch. I ordered a Pepperoni and Sausage pizza. It was insane. It comes on a hand-tossed thin crust which is flavorful and just the right amount of crispy. The pepperonis were spicy and some of the best I've ever had. I was truly impressed. Price-wise, it was a lot of food for the money and you could tell it was high quality ingredients. The portions are perfect for leaving room for a bit of gelato, feeling full but not bloated and about to die, and also friendly on the wallet.  I also had some of my girlfriend's salad and was impressed with that as well. We finished it off with some gelato of course - 2 flavors each so we got to try 4 (plus the free tastes). I try not to eat ice cream or gelato very often, but this is definitely worth the calories.   Service is great - everyone that works there is nice and friendly. The place is always clean and apparently they are soon going to be opening the upstairs as a dining area. The decor is modern and feels very upscale. This would be a fantastic place to take a first date if you're in high school or college and on a budget. You'll get out of here for less than you would at a chain like Outback or something.",

Our lil tots and guests should not be subjected to such health hazzard like smoking in a NO SMOKING area.  The employee we spoke with shrugged his shoulders  and didn't do anything bout it.  How disappointing!",

Even though their website boasts about their authenticity and traditions. Tastes like icecream that has too much ice. I still enjoyed the cool flavors but I wouldn't come again looking for gelato. They did have 2 sugar free options which was cool tho.  They also had what seemed like an autistic or Asperger's person working. I didn't realize this until he helped me at the counter with paying my bill. Before that I just thought he was clueless and kinda rude and spoke too softly. I'm highly supportive of mental health and actually used to do behavior therapy with autistic kids so I'm not being discriminating at all...while I commend the business for hiring someone with a mental disability, as a customer this was not an enjoyable customer service experience.",

I'm hoping that they will expand their vegan flavors because the chocolate was delicious! Like most frozen dessert places, you get to taste test flavors before you make a decision. There were only two employees working when we were in. One was trying to take orders for the connected pizza place and the other was making the food. So we had to wait a bit before we got served, but we were acknowledged after a few minutes.  The gelato is on point. The prices are fair. The venue is spacious and clean. It's a good stop by spot after...or before dinner. ;)",

But last time I was here the waitress that seated us was very unfriendly, maybe we caught her on a bad day? She seemed irritable and angry. Luckily the waitress that took our order was friendly and nice. After ordering and having our pizza at the table, we went to the counter to order our gelato.  Again the two employees didn't seem very friendly and when she scooped my second scoop to put it on my cone she dropped it into another ice cream flavor and then just put it on my cone anyway instead of asking me if I wanted a new scoop. Also, some of the flavors ended up tasting icy or old like when ice cream sits too long in your freezer.   I'll be sure to find a new ice cream place that's open late.",

The general consensus was both were delicious, but we all would order the Capricciossa if we were only ordering one! Also, as a heat lover, the Testarossa is on the spicier side- order accordingly.   After finishing our pizza, we tested the gelato. I tried a 2 scoop bowl of chocolate caramel fudge brownie & stracciatella and WOW! Maybe it was the beer? Maybe it was the heartburn from the Testarossa? But this gelato really hit the spot! It would be challenging to pick one flavor over the other, but I would enjoy them both frequently if I lived in Scottsdale!",

The only downfall is, it seemed like there was only one employee serving all the bar area and the gelato as she wasn't always available for tastes and service at either. I spotted her cleaning outside in the patio at one point when Someone was waiting at the bar for a refill. But she was friendly enough. Over at the pizza counter I noticed the young man was enjoying both a gelato and his telephone. He never did say hi he just gave me the expression that said, what do you want?   So overall I would definitely say give it a go special if you want to sit out in a nice enclosed covered patio.",

I still wanted to try the food.  I got their thin crust as advertised and the bottom was soggy.  The toppings were piled onto one side and it had very little cheese to combat the watery toppings.  No doubt this why it was soggy.  It wasn't even hot.  On the flip side their gelato is quite good hence the three stars.",

Perhaps other pizzas are better but I wanted to taste their tomato sauce and mozzarella. Disappointing. The gelato then, is full of sugary flavors that you gain weight only looking at 'em. Almost no fruit flavors. Service was absent as well, will not return.",

But let's focus on the reason I went, which is the restaurant's namesake: gelato. The place lacks many of the traditional flavors which is neither good nor bad. It means you might not get that obscure treat you love but they get inventive. Consistency (as in the texture and quality across products) varies. I found some of the gelati was a bit icy.

The wife and I ate dinner at Grimaldis and had to walk off some pizza so we headed up Scottsdale Blvd and saw this on our left.  I had to stop.    I got 2 flavors....chocolate and almond snickers.  The almond snickers was awesome with just enough nuts and caramel twist etc.  Now the plain chocolate gelato....this my friends was freaking AMAZING!  It was so light and creamy.  The taste reminded me of eating a chocolate cake...the best chocolate cake ever....and this was in gelato form.  It was a little over 5 bucks for 2 scoops.  I like how they give you a dinky little \"shovel\" to eat your gelato.  Makes your brain think you are eating way more because its in such small doses on the tiny spoon.    I didnt know what I was missing out on all these years never having  tried gelato.  I plan on going back here at least twice more over the next 3 days I have left in AZ.  It was awesome!",

The phone was so far away from her mouth I could hear a word she was saying. I hope this pizza is not as bad as her customer service skills. It took 5 min to place an order for one pizza.",

When I used work in old town I would make my trek down Scottsdale road on foot even on those hot summer days when cars pass you by just to bring excruciating gusts of hot desert air upon your back it was well worth it for their  iced lattes.   Now I have discovered Affagoto, a large scoop of your choice gelato and fresh brewed espresso poured on top to create a delicious heart pounding  rush of caffeine and sugar. It feels like how one would feel when they fall in love for the first time, but this comes at only a $5 price and you can feel it all over again.   The staff is great, courteous and very informative in making suggestions.   Gelato Spot Thank you!",

Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

    "text": "I was in town visiting and walking around. The \"Wood fired Pizza\" sign caught my eye and I was instantly hooked. I ordered the Honey Basil pizza (Honey, Goganzola, Basil) and my buddy ordered the American (Sausage, Pepperoni). Both Pizzas came out like soup.  Basil Honey - Great flavor. I assume it was the honey on mine but there was a pool of liquid in the center. Unfortunately this seepedto the bottom of the pizza after being cut by the kitchen before serving. So, naturally the crust was soaked with liquid making EXTREMELY messy to eat.  American - This one was also served with a pool of liquid but unfortunately grease. Naturally, any meat topped pizza will have some grease, but this, like the honey basil, was necessary to eat with knife and fork due to the grease soaked crust.  I'm giving 2 stars because I will not be going back. The service was great and received in a timely matter. The pizza had quality ingredients. However, when pizza is served with that much liquid, it's a no go for me.",

The owner was concerned that some potential large party could show up later on so she wanted to keep the empty tables empty.  Clearly not a very customer friendly approach.  And kinda silly.

    "text": "Original review on top, 1 year later at the bottom:  Oh man this was good stuff. We stopped on our way to the airport looking to satisfy our sweet tooth before the bitter TSA experience we were about to experience (Don't touch my junk bro!).   The staff was very helpful, we probably sampled 6 or 7 flavors between the two of us, and they never batted an eye. They were helpful in suggesting flavors, and flavor combinations. I don't think I tasted a single one I wouldn't have thoroughly enjoyed eating a whole scoop of. But once we finally settled on our two flavors each, we realized why no one cared if we had a few samples; When you charge $10 for 2 (very small) cups of ice cream, you can afford to give away a lot of samples :)  So yes, it is very expensive, but yes it is also very tastey. We'll be back :)  Update almost 1 year later: Dropped to 3 stars. We went back! I'm not sure if the pizza was a new addition since we were there last, or if we were just so Gelato driven last time that we didn't even notice it. But in either case, this time I decided to pick up a pizza to take back to the hotel room with me. I like fru fru pizzas with the oddball ingredient combinations, etc, so this looked right up my alley, however I couldn't really find a good combination of toppings. I did a little customization, and 10 minutes later I was on the way back to the hotel room with Gelato and Pizza! Unfortunately by the time I got back to my hotel room, which was no more than a mile or two away (5 minutes tops), the pizza was soggy. I can appreciate a thin crust pizza, but this was like eating sauce and toppings on a soggy cracker. The crust just instantly turned to mush. Even rolling it up into the (tough) outer edge crust barely worked. I basically ended up just eating the pizza with a spoon (literally! since thats all I had in the hotel room). If I read that they have improved their crust, I'd go back for pizza, otherwise they should stick to the gelato :)",

    "text": "Im putting the same review on the 2 listing because My expeirence involved both locations. One location should not be isolated.  I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!  Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site.  I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.  Lindsay,  Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot.

Other places, like That's Amore give you 2 flavors in the small container.  The other thing is that they scoop the gelato like ice cream and it's a little too cold like ice cream.  Gelato should be piled into the container a little sloppyly and it should be a couple of degrees warmer than ice cream.  The flavors are great and the stores are nice, but I am a gelato snob and prefer That's Amore.",

The seatings are great both inside and outside (watering mist++++) on the patio, parking is convenient or you could just stroll around the Old Town center's many shops and drop by to get a nice scoop or two of your favorite gelato flavors. And if you aren't feeling for gelato they have some Italian roast coffee to satisfy your caffeine blitz all day long!",

Old town Gelato makes their gelato from scratch using only natural flavors where as gelato spot orders kits and and just adds dairy to it. The gelato at Gelato Spot is soooooooo sweet u need water right after to kill the sugar taste.   Gelato classico is family owned and operated so u see the same ppl there at all times. check it out u wont be disappointed ...",

I'll take ice cream form the super-market instead of over priced and unfriendly.   The few times I was there I also waited 10 minutes when they were only a little busy, and up to 25 when they were pretty busy.  I would seek out something else. Like I said, not great all around.  In response to the comment below from Tommy:  I do appreciate your accommodations, I have no doubt that you do value your customers. I am not one to jump to a conclusion about any establishment, and I did come in several times. Overall I was unimpressed by the quality of the service every time, and the food was, in my opinion, sub-par.   I do appreciate you taking the time to respond to this and I am glad that others liked your establishment. As I see from other reviews, my experiences were hopefully the only three times the staff and kitchen were having a bad day.",

It is the closest I have had to when I was in Italy.Love the gelato but their Italian coffees are great! I have their iced vanilla latte with soy and it is amazing and big!  I took a friend for coffee 15 min before they opened and the staff member was sooo nice said no problem made up the coffees and my friend proceeded to say \" I hate You this coffee is so good I wish I lived closer to get it instead of Starbucks\".  They added brick oven Pizza and it is very good, smaller than some pizzas but delicious ingredients.  It is very pretty inside and staff is very nice, it is my boyfriend and mine favorite treats.

It taste wonderful when it's hot. The focaccia chop salad is good, too. The focaccia itself is crispy and fluffy with a hint of flavor. The chop salad is fresh and each piece is cover with the dressing with the just right of amount. The salad is not soggy at all so the focaccia still taste good event they put the salad above it. The gelato is a little bit pricey. But it is good though. I can taste the real pineapple in it.",

Not only is it a fun atmosphere but their ice cream is so sweet and so good that it hits the spot.  I cant help myself, I can make these puns all day, I have to stop by when I pass by it.  I will say the down side is the price, but if you are willing to spend your money on cold stone for the 4 dollars and some odd cents, go here its way better and a lot more chill.    I have yet to try the coffee here, but I can only imagine that its as good as the ice cream.  Recommendations: To anyone that eats ice cream",

    "text": "the G-spot offers a smorgasbord of different flavors... more than 20 flavors for sure! A cup of gelato offered single scoop, double, and triple melts away all the trouble clouding your mind or for a brief period enjoying this sweet concoction of deliciousness and all things yum and creamy you put your troubles aside and enter the happy zone of gelato world.   Like any good gelato establishment samples are encouraged especially since there are too many flavors and the combinations are endless, like a scoop of the rum raisin with the roche. I tend to go for the gelato's with liqueurs since there's nothing wrong with some yummy alcohol mixed in with cream.   At G-spot they explain the positives of why gelato is better than ice cream, it's a spin but heck explain all you want and in the end I'll look at it and be like...\"of course gelato is better than ice cream with 32% less butterfat, my body should thank me that I chose this healthier option! Oh another cup you say? Ok... (tell myself, reassure myself... it's healthy) one more please =)\". Gelato mi amigos is worth the calories!! YUM!!!  This location is at the corner of 3rd ave and Scottsdale, so it's outside seating makes a good place to people watch, and the layout of the store has couches, and numerous tables to sit with large windows, and free wi-fi. It's an awesome place and the prices are inexpensive. SO if I'm not feeling a froyo run, my next option is gelato and this is the place that I frequent! Oh and this is an awesome place for an after dinner date!",

    "text": "The workers here are so sweet.  I am one of the bad customers that end up sampling over 10 different gelatos.  They were wonderful because none of the workers complained!  In other words, great customer service!  As for the gelato, it's extremely tasty and it comes with a little wafer or cookie straw that adds that special addition to your gelato.  My favorite flavors are the pistachio, almond, strawberry, cheesecake, and salty caramel.  I always end up getting two flavors.  Make sure if you do this, get two flavors that compliment each other (don't get two that are very sweet or you will regret like me).     This place is great for a date with a friend or lover.  It's big and some areas have a cushion area where you can sit close.",

    "text": "Thanks to a Groupon last year, we found this spot and have visited a few times since then.  Having never been to Gelato Spot, we didn't know what to expect.  We've driven by it dozens of times and it appeared to be a small joint that served Gelato.  When we arrived, we were pleasantly to find a restaurant that offered much more than Gelato.  Menu items we've ordered during our visits:  Spicy Pepperoni Pizza (Di Napoli Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Spicy Pepperoni, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.50  Classic Pizza (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Grana Padano, Tuscan Olive Oil), $9.95  Sausage & Peppers Panini (Hot Italian Sausage, Wood Fired Onions, Roasted Red Peppers, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Tuscan Olive Oil, Grana Padano), $7.95  Grilled Cheese Panini (Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Provolone, Gorgonzola, Fresh Tomato, Hint of Honey), $5.95  Gelato & Sorbet, $3.99 ea Raspberry Cookies n Cream Tiramisu  The Pizzas are by far my favorite menu item.  They're really good.  I didn't expect to find that in a Gelato joint!  The Panini's are ok, the Sausage & Peppers Panini was too soggy.  The Grilled Cheese Panini was good.  The Gelato & Sorbet is awesome.  Raspberry and the Cookies n Cream are my 2 favorite.  You can sample as many as you like before you buy, that's what I like to do! :)  Overall, it's a nice casual restaurant to visit.  It's order/pick up at the counter, limited service, but the food is great.  The worst part about coming here is the parking.  There's a tiny parking lot with a handful of spots in the back of the building.  If that's full, you'll have to park down the street, which isn't very convenient...especially during the blazing hot Summer.  Return Factor - 70%",

    "text": "SO-SO gelato in downtown Scottsdale!  I was in the area of Scottsdale's little art-walk village and needed a little snack. The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.  Popular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee (note: * = what I ordered)  - You can order a small, medium or large.  - Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup.  - If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup.  - If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup.  - Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor.   I ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!  I did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried.   Service was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision.   Parking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.  Not sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu. I do hope that in the future - they don't make the gelato as sugary as I had during my visit.   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #26",

Looking forward to returning & relaxing over a cold treat in this heat!    Always delicious! I do miss the groupons. Fun treat for my daughter :)  Please fix the huge pothole right when you step off the curb though. My little girl tripped & fell pretty hard & got a huge gash on her knee last time we went. I carried her back in with blood running down her leg & the young girls behind the counter just looked at us blankly as I carried her to the restroom to clean up. I'm in the restaurant business and I expected them to at least offer napkins or be sympathetic!",

I loved the Salted Caramel and the New York Cheesecake.   FOOD: Didn't look at the menu, but the food coming out for other customers looked very tasty! Wish I could have tried a pizza. There's also a coffee bar. And booze?! (I think?)  VALUE: Expected prices for gelato and Scottsdale eats. Nothing crazy expensive.  FINAL VERDICT: Highly recommend this place!

I'm not into gelato or desserts but dang the selection looked amazing. I tried the pineapple and ham lunch pizza. Made fresh in a brick oven pizza right over my shoulder. Tasted so fresh and I liked how they sliced the pineapple. The price was only $8 and it filled me up. I could have eatin more so if your a big eater you might go with bigger pizza.  That's good for the quality of the pie. The waitress and the other lady working seemed to be in such good moods. Just liked everything about this place. II will be back.  Ok. She talked me into trying the Gelato. And I'm now hooked. Haha.",

It's clear this a new restaurant but guys, get over yourselves. Your combinations of toppings only appeals to to the most obscure pseudo intellectual hipster trend of the minute crowd.   If you are looking for a good wood fired pizza with a variety of fresh toppings, go to Grimaldi's.

When I saw \"gelato and wood fired pizza\" together on my Yelp app, I knew it was going to be a win-win situation.  I have NEVER seen a place with this many gelato flavors. Holy cow! Any flavor you've ever wanted is here, and I was trying to decide which one I wanted to go with, when I laid my eyes on the sign... for gelato shakes. Gelato? Shakes? Gelato in a shake? I had to try it, and went with the small which meant I got to choose two flavors. Yellow cake batter and cookies and cream, it turns out, make quite a nice pair. They put them both in a blender with milk, and voila! Something tells me I'll be visiting this place later in the week for another genius flavor concoction.  For my pizza, I ordered the marinara, which comes with Di Napoli tomato sauce, fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and Tuscan olive oil. I also added cheese to it. I carried it for about fifteen minutes back to my hotel and I was surprised at how well it held up! The pizza was so good, and the flavors all blended together perfectly. I really enjoyed the thin and chewy crust, and you could tell that the ingredients were high quality.  I hear they have amazing coffee here and I want to try that next time... but if I had to choose one thing from this place, it's the gelato shake. Go try one for yourself and find out!",

The service was absolutely the worst service I've had in the past 20 years of my life. Our server did not apologize nor did she show any sympathy. Even though my family had already finished their meals and were ready to go by the time the fourth pie was finally done. When it was cooked, it was cooked so poorly. The dough still soft and the cheese barely melted on. I tried and tried again to give this service multiple shots, unfortunately I was let down. Not. Worth. Your. Time. We had to wait four ever. Order Pizza Hut and save yourself the time and energy of having to deal with this restaurant. I would however recommend this place if you personally enjoy having to repeat yourself half a dozen times and wait over forty five minutes for the correct order. N then continue to have to look the server in the face as she smirks while you inform her of the issues you'd experienced. To each their own, but personally I'm all set on an experience like this. Absolutely dreadful.",

After a nice stroll, we ended up here and we're pleasantly greeted by the employees. I was also rather excited that they open so late. They didn't close until midnight. Thank god for that!! I'm glad they accommodate the late night cravers. The place is conveniently located in a corner location within a pizzeria. It is one in the same. The location is clean and the place is quaint and comfortable. Employees are great! They are friendly and pleasant. The guy behind the gelato counter was very helpful and friendly. He helped us decide what flavors mixed well with others. He also allowed us to taste nearly all the flavors! I ended up getting a scoop of the cheesecake and a scoop of the strawberry! Oh my goodness! It hit the spot. It really tasted as though I was chomping down on a real strawberry cheesecake! I saw a decent amount of customer flow and the employees were constantly making gelato in the back. You could tell that it was freshly made and it doesn't stay out too long. I am so happy that we found this spot and if I ever come back, I will be sure to pay this mountain of deliciousness a visit!!! It will not fail you!",

    "text": "Homemade gelato, Pascucci coffee, and now delicious salads, panini and wood-fired pizzas... this G spot really has it all!  I was hesitant when I learned that the Gelato Spot in Old Town was coming out with pizzas and salads, but after my lunch there today, I'm completely sold!  I was there with Lindsey F, so I have a feeling she'll be updating her review soon too, but I wanted to beat her to it, so here it is.  We shared the chicken louie wedge salad (iceberg wedge, chicken breast, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, bacon, chives, avocado, champagne vinegarette, blue cheese crumbles, louie dressing, grana padano) although opted to get it minus the chives and blue cheese, and the american pizza (di napoli Tomato sauce, mozzarella fior di latte, italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, tuscan olive oil, grana padano) with mushrooms.  Both were delicious!    Seriously, the quality of the ingredients in both the salad and the pizza was evident... I cleaned the salad plate and ate my fair share of pizza too... We learned that this type of pizza is an art, and the pizza chef came from another well-known wood burning pizza place in town.  It was cooked just right and we were told it's best right out of the oven, so plan on dining in if you can.  Warning - the pepperoni really does have a kick!    I love the fast-casual ordering system (order at the counter and then your food will be brought to you).  Prices are reasonable ($9 for our huge salad and $10 for the pizza).  I may have to go for a panini next visit as they look pretty awesome too, and there is a huge selection with hot and cold choices ranging from Italian grilled cheese, veggie, sausage & peppers, turkey, tuna, and more!  I enjoyed my  lunch so much that I forgot to save room for gelato, so I suggest saving a spot in your belly (a g-spot so to speak) when you go.  Buon Appetito! ;)",

However an occasional stop in to this place always does a body good.  Plus, I've got great memories here!  Local Chefs offering up their concoction of gelato at this location; which is pretty cool.  However, I'd say stick to cooking and leave the gelato making to the experts haha!    The place itself is always updating and changing up new concepts.  I noticed a bar now serving up some coffee and an pizzeria upstairs.  In the end, that is why The Gelato Spot has kept up with the times.  Having the ability to evolve into a new restaurant yearly is a plus in my books - Enjoy!",

A mouth-watering display of gelatos greeted me as I entered, so I had to try the blueberry. It was rich in flavor and very satisfying! Oh, about that pizza. It was good, too! Our waitress was pleasant as well. I will certainly come back here next time I'm in the area!",

    "text": "The parking in Old Town Scottsdale can be at times a challenge. I was able to pull into the back of the restaurant and found parking without an issue. They share a small lot behind the building with the gallery center next door. Each spot has a sign indicating which business the parking is for; SOCA for the gallery and a G for Gelato Spot; and notification that you will be towed if you are not using that spot for the designated business. Upon finding the G spot I parked and we entered the resturant for pizza.  We were 5 total. When we walked in the girl stated that it would be a second and she would seat us. That was followed a few minutes later by another girl stating that it will be just a second. Then a few minutes later a different girl asked how many in the party. I pointed to all of us and again she asked for the number. I stated 5 and she said that it will be a while as they need to clear a table. Ok. She acted like it would be a long while then followed up it would be 5-10 minutes. We were seating within 5 minutes when they pushed a couple empty tables together. Once seating a guy came over to take our drink orders. We order and he brought them pretty fast. He then took our orders. 4 total pizzas; very thin crust about 10-12 inches, and two salads. Two pizzas were pepperoni, one from the options, and another was a create your own. So far so good.   Thing went south from here.  This is just a tip. If you have say 100 seats available then one assumes that you want to fill those. So you have to staff accordingly. Having different wait staff say multiple times that they are really busy not real good. Either they are not experienced enough to multitask and do the job or you are truly understaffed which is a failure on managements part. Whatever the reason it does need to be addressed.  The waiter came over and brought the salads. They were ok nothing really special. Not really a big fan on mostly white iceberg lettuce, a little more actual green leafs would help. Then pretty quickly the pepperoni pizzas came out. About 5-10 minutes later the \"options\" pizza came out. A large portion of it had burn crust. Maybe a little too much as neither of the pepperonis had any burnt spots. After about 15 minutes the forth pizza did not come out. The waiter was walking by so I asked him about it. He stated that he would get it, he checked and I guess they messed it up and were to remake it. That was the last he came to the table. There was suddenly a \"rush\" of people for the Gelato. Our waiter disappeared behind the counter and never returned to our table. I grabbed a waitress who was walking by and inquired as to our pizza. She asked what was on it and went to check. She came back with a pizza. As it was missing some of the items; I would say not the one we ordered. She did a drop and go and put the pizza down and scurried off. So when she did come back about 5 minutes later to inquire about it we stated that it was missing what we asked for however we were eating it anyway.  At this point we kind of became self sufficient. It was free gelato night with a pizza order so we just got up and got our own. I also went to the \"bar\" to get my refills on the drinks and also got up to get a box to go. We received the bill and it was dropped and forgotten. We had the credit card displaying for over 10 minutes and no one came by. I walked up to the \"bar\" to pay.  So - Because of all of the different mistakes they did take care of a lot. They removed the one pizza from the ticket and also gave a discount. That does mean a lot. The pizza was ok. The late one was cold by the time we got it. The salad below average. The gelato was pretty good. Green ice tea was also good. Staffing issues needs to be addressed. The waiter who morphed into the gelato server stated that it was actually opposite. He was there to server gelato and helped wait the tables until they got busy in the gelato section. So it appears there was not a pass off to the actual wait staff. Over all maybe a C+.  Since there are multiple gelato spots in Phoenix and well as wood fire and/or brick oven pizza places doubt I will be back.",

I like the variety of flavors they offer. And if you're wondering what it'll taste like, you can always get a sample. You can mix and match all the flavors as much as you want. I really like the snickers gelato flavor with some mint chocolate chip. Just writing this review makes me want to get some lol. I love this location; being on the corner and on Scottsdale Rd, it makes it perfect to sit and people watch. It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness.",

When I found out about this location I was very excited since it's very close to my job. I walked in during lunch hours it was pretty empty to my surprise. I bought my gelato and had a seat there. This gelato spot is actually in a restaurant so whole I was there I decided to try the pizza. Unfortunately, it took forever for anyone to even offer a menu I had to get up and ask for a menu. While I was there the cook making the pizzas kept starring at me like I was a piece of meat I felt very uncomfortable. One of the waitresses (I did not get her name but she was a brunette) went over by him and both started talking and both looked back at me as if they were talking about me. The blonde waitress was very nice though and noticed I was in a rush to get out of there. I don't think I would ever go back here.",

I was very confused as to where I should go to order, they have 3 different counters for three different types of food items they serve. I wasn't sure if it was a Pizzeria, Gelato or coffee spot. They also had beer displayed. Someone finally came out of the back room (Asian Lady) carrying a dog!!!! Animals in the kitchen?? The other worker that came out of the back was scratching her head and touching cups etc... with out washing her hands. At that point I was disgusted and decided to leave.  This place is totally unhygienic and not following Health standards and laws. There is no way I will every return to this place nor would I recommend it to anyone ever. Coincidental a group I am involved with were discussing an Ice Cream Social that very same day when I got back to my office and were considering The Gelato Spot. I was quick to inform them of my experience and none the less we are having the mixer at Yogurt Land!!!",
