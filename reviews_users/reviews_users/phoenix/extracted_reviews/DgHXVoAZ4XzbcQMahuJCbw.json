Brittany asked us right away what we wanted to drink. She was very prompt to bringing our drinks straight to the table and extremely knowledgeable of the menu when we had questions. We had our food in very short time. The presentation of the food was excellent. The taste was hands down, probably the best crackle barrel we had in a long time. We never needed to ask for anything. They brought it to the table before we even had the chance to ask about it. The manager even stopped by to see how everything was. I would highly recommend to visit this restaurant if you're in the Chandler area.",

It's ok diner type food.  I had the country boy.  My ham was good, hash browns were good, and grits were well, grits.  Eggs were cooked a little too long but nothing to throw a fit over.  The atmosphere and the store make for a good dining experience.  Thank you Cracker Barrel, much appreciated.",

It's a breakfast place, so as soon as you sit down just give them the lunch menu back, because you don't want anything on it.  Then, open up the breakfast menu and find 'Uncle Hershels Breakfast' and order that.  Then eat it.  That's pretty much all you have to do.  If you actually haven't been to a Cracker Barrel before, then know this: There are about 1000 of them, and they're a country restaurant and a store that sells candy and beanie babies and a whole bunch of garbage that only an old person would want, but nobody's forcing you to buy the stuff, so just eat the breakfast and get over it.",

My wife said they had to wait an hour in Chicago in order to be seated at Cracker Barrel.  But the location we went to in Phoenix, we were immediately seated.  The service was excellent.  I wanted apple juice and the server figured out a way to accommodate me, even though they ran out.  They were really attentive.  The food was great!  I had the redundant Chicken Fried Chicken with biscuits and gravy, grits, eggs over easy and a casserole hash.  It was so good.. the chicken was fried perfectly, nice and crunchy, tasty.  The biscuits were melt in your mouth near flaky texture and gravy was good and tasty.  Grits were good.  The hashbrown casserole was nice and hearty.  The meal that I had is called Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast.  My wife enjoyed her meal as well.  Prices are decent.  They also have a store as you enter so that you can get some gifts for others or things for yourself.  Cool spot.  They even sell furniture outside.  I saw a chair that I liked.

A retail store of trinkets and the sorts was a good way to keep the kiddos occupied, as well as adults. They have a breakfast menu plus a lunch and dinner menu. I decided to go with the breakfast healthy plate of egg beaters, turkey bacon, a side of fruit and cheese and grits. Just enough for me since I know I'm saving for dessert and some Starbucks concoction.   Lunch time was so busy that there were no high chairs. However they did have booster seats. The cleanliness of the entire restaurant was mediocre. Could've been some improvement that goes for being super busy.

My one complaint, however, is that from I was seated I blatantly witnessed a couple of servers pointing and talking/laughing about other customers.  That should never be seen By a guest.  It is rude, and it's disrespectful.  Other than that we enjoyed our meal.",

Because we wanted two sides the server suggested we get the regular meal, which actually costs about twice as much as the child's portion.  Fish was more \"crunch\" than fish, last piece was not the best so I left it.  Forgot to tell the server to bring the hash brown casserole \"hot\" and as usual it was warm, not hot.  Should have sent it back but we were both hungry. Will certainly request changes next visit.  Not my best visit to Cracker Barrel.",

The three peices of crispy bacon were okay if you wipe off the brown left over grease. My decaf coffee was nasty. My creamer taste old.  The waitress was the best part of the visit she was trying to help the food and coffee situation out but, I'd already made up my mind as an unsatisfied customer. This was my second and last visit.

My buddy and I were craving breakfast for lunch once again. I think we're on some unspoken quest for the perfect breakfast for lunch place.   I am so glad we headed to Cracker Barrel today. I had \"Mama's french toast breakfast\". It should be called \"Mama's stuff you full because she knows damn well you ain't been eatin' right without her there platter\". It came with 4 slices of sourdough french toast, 2 eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and of course I had to order a small side of the hash brown casserole. Of course. I washed all the artery clogging goodness with a large OJ. YUM. Everything came out hot and fresh and with maple syrup. Real maple syrup, y'all! My lunch buddy had the country breakfast that came with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and grits! We were both so happy we were giggling like little kids in between bites of the great breakfast. For about the same price of another competitor's breakfast platter, we got a fresh baked, hot off the griddle and huge breakfast. I think we've decided that this is a favorite from now on!  ....or have we???",

But this place is huge, and there was no wait at all. They could even seat six tops without a wait! We scored a table right by the front window, and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress for drinks. She pointed out the two most popular dishes on the menu - pancake breakfast (think grand slam at denny's)  or the standard meat, eggs, biscuits and gravy.Big menu, but no omelets? I had the french toast w/ bacon. It was cold and leathery. Husband had the grand-slam thing - it was a lot o f food w/ a  big bowl of  canned tasting gravy.   Food was just ok. Coffee was bad. Service was great. Won't go back  - there are better breakfast places in Ahwatukee.",

We decided Cracker Barrel would be the perfect stop for brunch.  The wait was 25 minutes that Sunday around 1pm.  We didn't mind, because we spent that time perusing the old-fashioned candy and timeless children's games in the gift shop area.  I also love checking out the latest and greatest kitchen gadgets and decorative plates, etc. in the gift shop.  I purchased a cute muffin pan with a snap-on lid perfect for bringing baked goods to work!  The food was outstanding and definitely fresh.  I love the apple cider in a mug too!  Mmm I think that's my favorite thing on the whole menu!  I can't get enough of that tasty cider!  The biscuits are so yummy too!  Cracker Barrel food never disappoints me.  The service was a bit short, since they were so busy, and that wasn't too cool, but I'm still giving this review 4 stars, because service is usually much better at this location.",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel is just OK for a traditional, comfort food breakfast. If you're looking for novel breakfasts this place isn't for you. Biscuits and bacon are the mainstay. If you want a tummy warming breakfast, the is the place. :)   Today I had eggs in basket with bacon. This was one of the smaller size breakfasts and I was glad I went that way because even this was enough food for me. The bread was sour dough with a perfectly perched egg on top. The egg was cooked to order. The bread was dripping in butter. (Yum! But back to healthy eating tomorrow!)  It came with three slices of bacon and a small portion of their hash brown casserole. Hash browns are good, and I think cooked with cheese. Definitely a caloric splurge (once again).   One of my favorite things about breakfast is the coffee. I was disappointed. It was okay coffee if you drink coffee of the Folger's variety at home, but I like it dark and bold. My palate is trained that way after years of drinking amazing cups of Joe. I couldn't even finish the first cup. Next time, water only.   Service was good --- barely any waiting and they were efficient and friendly  And now, the store with the goodies (aka gift shop) I am always compelled to look around because one year I found the cutest pumpkin salt and pepper shakers here for fall.  I scored again today since I found some really cute resin angels for upcoming birthdays AND they were on sale.   All in all, this is a ok place for breakfast and for a bit of spontaneity, curio shopping. Friendly staff with comfort food is always a good thing.",

    "text": "We had a gift certificate for Crackle Barrel and so we decided to try this place. I walked in and confusion. It's a real country store with a bunch of old stuff hanging down from the ceiling. Looking for where to go then as you look at the back of the store and you see the hostess stand. Thank goodness.   The place is packed and it's like a very homey country place with lots of old country pictures and plaques. I got the menu and again confusion. Huge menu for lunch and dinner with another menu for breakfast (they serve breakfast all day). So going through both menus is tough.   I started out with their raspberry lemonade in a frosted mug. Really good, fresh and I loved it. I had the fried catfish with Mac & cheese, fried okra, and hash browns. Oh yea forgot to tell you, you get to pick three sides with your meal. The catfish was ok. A little dry. The mac & cheese was ok. Not great. Okra was a little moist. Not crispy like it should be and the hash browns were ok. Not a great meal but ok. Also, they bring out muffins and cornbread muffins. I've had better cornbread. Not great. So I would say my meal was just ok.   My wife had the apple cider vinegar BBQ chicken. She loved it. It was very moist and the sauce was excellent. She was talking about it in the car. Haven't heard her talk about a meal like that before. I grabbed a little bit and it was very good. Loved the sauce. My son had the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good. No complaining from him.   The service was good. It took awhile for our server to greet us but understandable because the place was so busy. She did get our drinks and refilled us when we needed it. She was pretty good and friendly.   So the place is loud with people eating and enjoying themselves. Lots of families. There was music playing but I think it was. some country music. The food was okay to really good. I guess I just ordered the wrong thing. I did notice everyone ordering breakfast and the blueberry pancakes and French toast looked really good. So next time it's breakfast. Service was good and a real family atmosphere. Like I said I will probably be back but order from the breakfast menu. Enjoy.",

I asked to speak to a manager. When speaking to the manger there was no apologies all he said that he can not \"magically\" make room for us..... My response was WOW!  I know this is not Disneyland! Unfortunately, we didn't get to experience great service, all we got is BAD service, sarcasm and unprofessional ways to treat a paying customer.   I didn't even want to leave a STAR but I have NO CHOICE but to rate this restaurant for their horrible service in order for me to share my experience. I don't and won't recommend ANYONE with a large family to come to this place since they can't do MIRACLES (according to the Manager) to accommodate a paying customer, party of 16",

It seemed too crowded and I was a little unsure where to enter and exit the establishment. But overall the food hit the spot and I thought our server was very sweet.

This Cracker Barrel did not disappoint:  the service was great, the food was tasty, the portions were just right.  Upon entering this restaurant we were greeted by friendly staff who made us feel like we were family and that they were glad to see us.  They seemed so genuine because everyone (the server, the receptionist, the cashier, even the bus boy) all greeted us with a warm smile and engaged us in conversation.  We left feeling full and we left feeling valued.  Those who stop by should definitely take the time to peruse the gift store as well:  it is stocked with a variety of unique gift, clothing, and food items (even candies I remembered from the 60s).    Cracker Barrel is not just a restaurant with an attached gift shop:  it is an experience.",

    "text": "I've been eating at Cracker Barrels a long time. The experience keeps slipping. I don't think we'll be back after our last visit.   Firstly, and most concerning, is they allow open carry in their restaurants. Last weekend we went for breakfast and of course there was a wait, so we sat with our 5 month old in the rocking chairs. Some yahoo with a revolver slung low on his hip sits down across from us and because the muzzle of the gun was so long, when he sat down across from us the barrel became parallel to his thigh, I looked up and was staring directly into the barrel of his gun. It was pointed at my head and my baby's head. He looked a little on the slow side, how do I know if the safety's on or not? I got up and moved. I don't know why Cracker Barrel would want to take on that kind of liability with having loaded guns carried around a family restaurant.  Secondly, they've filled up the front \"store\" section with so much crap you can barely get through. There's always a ton of old people there, with walkers and/or oxygen and it's a hassle. It's hard to wade through with a purse, and it's a double hassle with a baby carrier. You have to gingerly step around stuff, trying not to knock over any of the bric-a-brac. I don't know what kind of revenue per square foot they're getting in that part of the restaurant to continue adding rack after rack but I can't stand it anymore.   The clutter in the front is annoying and their gun policy is unsafe. Plenty of other breakfast places to go to in the area. Won't be going back anymore.",

It's usually packed at this location before 1:00 p.m. on the weekends with an average 10-15 minute wait, but the food is so worth it. My all time favorite is the country fried steak. Old fashioned and just plain tasty. With their main dinner dishes, you also get three sides. With choices like mashed potatoes, steak fries, hash brown casserole, sweet baby carrots, and fried apples, you definitely can't go wrong! You're definitely going to leave her feeling stuffed if you finish your whole plate.   Their gift shop is also fun to look at while you're waiting. They have tons of old fashioned treats and seasonal decorations. The only slight hassle is having to pay for your food up front which can be annoying when there's already a long line.",

The food was delicious, but the service was horrible. Twice I had to go to the kitchen for a coffee refill, because my server, Angelica, had better things to do I guess. When I complained to the Manager, he seemed very annoyed  at me for saying anything. I will never go back to that location, and if and when I go to another location, I will always remember what happened in Chandler. I thought Cracker Barrel cared about good customer service. According to the Manager at this location, upsetting a customer is better than upsetting an employee. If I ever have service as horrible as I had today, I'm going to find somewhere else to get my Catfish & Eggs.",

    "text": "I was in the area getting acupuncture and really wanted a good breakfast.  My initial thought was to go to the Waffle House when I saw the sign coming off the highway.  The Waffle House and Cracker Barrel is probably 1 block from each other.  I wanted the Texas Cheesesteak sandwich from Waffle House and cheesy hash brown casserole from Cracker Barrel, ideally, that's what I wanted but didn't want to make two stops for the obvious reasons.  I decided on Cracker Barrel.  It was a Saturday afternoon (around 1 pm).  They had no wait time for a party of one so I was seated rather quickly.  My server came over immediately asking for my drink order.  I ordered water and OJ for when my food came out.  For brunch I ordered the old-timers (I believe that's the name).  It was grits, biscuits with gravy, sausage, cheesy hash brown casserole, and soft scrambled eggs with just a little cheese.  I received grits, biscuits and gravy, cheesy hash brown casserole, sausages and 2 hard fried eggs with 2 slices of barely melted cheese.    A different server delivered my food.  She literally just came over, said nothing, and put the plate in front of me.  I called out to her, excuse me ma'am.  She kept walking.  I started eating, started with the grits.  Once my server came back she noticed immediately that the eggs weren't cooked in the way I ordered them.   She said don't worry I'll put an order in for more eggs.  I started eating.  By the time she came back with my scrambled eggs I was almost through with my meal and they were slightly cold.  In fact, I didn't have anything left except for biscuits and jam.  I'm thinking those eggs belong to someone else because they weren't hot, warm or fresh.  They were cold.  I also noticed there was a party of one sitting behind me.  He ordered fried catfish, fried okra and mashed potatoes.  When his order came out he sent his fried okra and asked for it to me \"hot and fresh\", so clearly there's an issue there because the same thing happened to me.   I took about 2 bites of the eggs before I noticed a piece of brown-ish, blonde colored hair in the eggs.  I have black hair ... it wasn't mine so I left the eggs there.  My server noticed I barely ate the eggs, dropped the check and asked if everything was okay.  I was ready to go at that point so I said, everything was okay and I headed to the register.  She told me they took the cost of the OJ off instead of the cheese because the cheese cost more than the OJ!  I thanked her and headed out.  I'm not a huge fan of Cracker Barrel so I didn't bother complaining to management.  I just won't return.",

I never really paid attention to this before but they have a quite few locations in Arizona alone and they are everywhere in the United States. I must have went one of them somewhere in east coast.  Based on the decor of the restaurant, I wanted to eat biscuits and gravy with side of grits. I was on my way to some hiking, I wanted a lot of calories.  Old timer's breakfast comes with biscuits and gravy (so many of them, couldn't finish what was served), small side of grits, (thinking how grits tasted as I write my review, now I remember last time/place I went to a Cracker Barrel. Interesting how food brings back memory), hash brown casserole, and sausage patties. It all tasted how the restaurant is decorated.  I also tasted fried Apple, it wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, just natural Apple sweetness, it would be perfect to use it for Apple pie. I ate two off my friend's plate but I actually wanted to eat all. Next time I will just order my own.  Service was good. She was very friendly and efficient. We were there at 7am on Sunday and they weren't busy but based on how restaurant was set up (chairs outside), I bet they get really busy during peak time. How efficient she was, she looked like she's been working there for a while. I didn't feel we were rushed, she was just good at what she was doing.",

I am from out of state here for a soccer tournament and my family had her the first day we arrived here in AZ, which we told her all about. Two days later we came for lunch and requested her but she was busy. BUT she noticed us eating and came to ask us about the results of the tournament and asked how we were. It felt amazing for a server to take so much care in customer service to remember us after just ONE visit. If I had a company in AZ she would be someone I would want to work for me.  If my family and I lived here I would come back to this location just for Ashley!",

We were back for a visit recently & we were not disappointed,except for the fact that our favorite waitress was off the day we were there! Great breakfasts...you won't leave hungry! I love their salads for lunch,but they have lots of good sandwiches,too! Dinners are good,too. We love their Chicken Fried Steak & Chicken Fried Chicken on the dinner menu & at breakfast,too! My husband likes their Meatloaf. Our son's fave is their Chicken & Dumplings! They make fresh dumplings throughout the day (at least that's what they say on the Food Network) & they always seem fresh to me! I really hate to give you this tip,because I'm afraid that they'll run out next time I'm there! On Sunday they have a dinner special \"Homestyle Chicken\",2 Fried Chicken Breasts (boneless) with 2 sides & of course biscuts & corn muffins! These chicken pieces are so large (usually) that my husband & I would eat one for dinner & bring the other home for lunch on Monday! Don't forget to have a piece of Chocolate CocaCola Cake! YUM! Service is usually great,alot of the servers have been there at least 5 yrs & management,too...keeps the place consistant!  I can't wait to go visit again...I miss this place!",

My typical Cracker Barrel order:  - 2 eggs, scrambled - Biscuits (with butter) - Hashbrown Casserole (mmmmm cheesy potatoes) - Cinnamon Apples  For whatever reason this combination doesn't exist on their menu, so I usually end up ordering the Hasbrowns, Apples and Biscuits with a side of two scrambled eggs. But whatever. The point is that all of those things together are amazing. They make you feel like you're 6 years old and out to breakfast with Grandma. Plus, the crazy kitschy store sells John Deere baseball caps. How can you not love that? Add the fact that it's cheap as hell...plus the peg game on the tables...and it basically makes up for the fact that the servers appear to be hired from the local halfway house.   So yeah. When your arteries are feeling particularly too clear and you need some warm, salty, buttery goodness....head to Cracker Barrel.",

Brought the kiddos with me for the 1st time and they really liked their meals - except for the grits. They've never had it before, but I have and it wasn't anything special and it really didn't taste all that good. The portions were good size and we ended up taking some boxes home.  I grew up eating at CB after church on Sundays when there was one in Cerritos, CA long long ago. Still enjoy the quirkiness of the general store in the front as did my kids when they first walked in.

I really like their fried apples coz it reminds me of the wholesome, and slightly sweetish tart of an apple pie filling.   Anywho, recently went to brunch at the Cracker Barrel and ordered the Country Boy Special, an $8.99 deal with 3 eggs, a choice of country ham, pork chops or sirloin steak. I chose the pork chops. It also comes with the hashbrown cake, fried apples, grits, gravy and two biscuits. A whole lotta food but worth the deliciousness and calories.   I have to admit their pork chops are tender and yum, I've always heard good things about the pork chops in the past. Apart from that liked the gravy and their soft and warm buttermilk biscuits. I was stuffed, and had to take home my fried apples which i do love alone or with some vanilla ice cream, the perfect afternoon treat! Overall, if you'd like yum country food, this place is good even for a chain!  Oh and depending on the month, ask if they have their awesome coca cola chocolate cake... it's YUM!",

    "text": "Okay, we see the commercials all the time in Los Angeles which is silly because there are no Cracker Barrel restaurants/stores in all of California. So when planning our trip to Phoenix I decided to look and see if there was a Cracker Barrel anywhere near the resort. Awesome there was one just one exit up on the 10 freeway. The anticipation was high as we pulled in and saw the rows of rocking chairs for sale in front then once inside the smell of cinnamon candles was overwhelming. The novelty of this place in unbelievable. With Moon pies and jumbo size candy bars and soda and coffee and bake mix and I could go on, but my review is really for the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken and Dumplins no \"g\" in dumplins cuz were tryin to be authentic here. for my sides I ordered the Fried apples and steak fries. Okay the dumplins are not like my mommas these are the noodle flat kind of dumplins but they also had no flavor. I had to douse them with salt and pepper to get flavor into them. The fried apples were the best part of the meal. Also you get your choice of bread, I love corn bread so I picked that. My wife picked the buttermilk biscuit. I should have taken the Buttermilk Biscuit. Maybe my taste buds took a vacation but the cornbread had no flavor at all, She ordered the grilled chicken tenders mashed potatoes and Fries. She said all of her food was good, she asked me if I wanted to try them but I told her it might mess up my review of the restaurant.  So for novelty, I give it a five, for my food I give it a two for my wife's food I give it a four so overall average is three.",

There are a few things you can count on.....ice cold air conditioning (even when you don't need it), which usually ends up cooling off my food before I am done eating. But on the plus side, we can count on a clean establishment at all Cracker Barrels and home cooking and a cozy homestyle atmosphere. We stayed overnight at a nearby hotel so this CB was our go-to place for dinner and returned at breakfast...so why only 2 stars? Well, at dinner one of us was served the wrong dinner, it was close enough to what he ordered, but not what he expected (he got chicken fried steak when he ordered chicken fried chicken which is his favorite) he is so nice he didn't send it back, he just ate it. We figured it had to be a fluke, so when we went back for breakfast 14 hours later we figured no chance for a repeat performance, but yet again at breakfast, another server delivered the wrong breakfast to one of us. So, sorry, your employees need more training guys! We will be back and we hope the girls are better at their jobs. We love this food. Oh, and one other thing, my all-time favorite thing is the side order of beans, my little bowl of beans amounted to about 2 tablespoons full of beans with no juice in them....hardly something I would be waiting to eat....At breakfast, my Uncle Hershel's platter had the toughest piece of country ham I have ever eaten, I could not eat it.",

The service is usually A+ ( on average I usually tip the servers 25% because they are so nice and welcoming). I prefer the Breakfast menu over the Lunch & Dinner selection. My favorite breakfast is the Blueberry pancakes that's served with REAL blueberry syrup, I usually get bacon and scrambled eggs on the side. For dinner you can't go wrong with the Catfish or Chicken Fried steak. The price or the food and quantity/quality are right on. Don't expect fine dining here but do enjoy the fat induced food coma afterwards.",

The toast was not toasted completely.  The service is right out of the TV show Alice - \"kiss my grits, mel'.  Don't expect great service or even digestible food.  Pass on this one.  Not worth the time it takes to park and get through the gift shop.",

I ordered a chicken breast sandwich with Monterey Jack cheese and green chili and fries.  first let me say the taste was very good, the sandwich came on sourdough and the bread on bottom of the sandwich was soggy that my sandwich fell apart and it was hard to eat.  But all in all the flavor was a 5 star experience, the server which I do not have her name was very good and attentive without being over bearing and the ambiance was great.  we ordered desert to share (my daughter and I) and we had an apple pie in a bowl with pecans and ice cream and it was huge.  it could feed a family of four.  forgot the name of the desert but would do it again.

Last night I went with my girlfriend and our food came out really fast, which was great. But it was warm at best. My mashed potatoes were pretty much cold, with warm spots. My chicken n dumplings were mostly warm, with some cold spots. My fried apples were cold. The mac n cheese was slightly above room temperature. Her meat loaf sandwich was prepared different then usual, had no gravy, and the bread was soggy. We were both starving so we ate what was brought, and I had planned on just letting the manager know. I even took my leftovers in a box. I wasn't looking for any sort of discount or anything, since we had come in late on a Sunday night and the food tasted great besides the temperature.  When I mentioned the issues to the manager, he immediately said they'd take care of our meal. I was shocked. I was actually offering to pay our bill, and he wouldn't let me.  Everyone has off days, and the manager went above and beyond to correct an issue that I wasn't even really that concerned about. Last nights visit won't stop me from coming back.",

The environment is very \"olde-tymey\" and cute, but the food is pretty great!  The servers were terrific, the coffee good, and the juices (both OJ and grapefruit) were fresh squeezed.  For *less than $4* you could get some hash brown casserole (baked with cheese and onions mmm), a bowl of fried apples (buttery, not too mushy, and tart enough to balance the sweet), and two flaky biscuits.  Unbelievable values on the menu.  Had the pancakes on another visit - perhaps a touch too buttery, but absolutely delicious, just the right balance of hearty and sweet.  Good bacon too!  Classic food, delivered simply with a smile, for a great price.  If I lived nearby I'd be coming back, a lot.",

    "text": "I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.   My family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!",

Every time we have been the food comes out fast and hot. And endless hot coffee is my favorite part.   The store on the other side of the restaurant is adorable! So many cute things to look at, especially when they break out their holiday decorations!

    "text": "Breakfast for lunch? Why not! Momma's Pancake Breakfast consists of three buttermilk pancakes served with 100% pure natural syrup n' butter plus two eggs and thick-sliced bacon or sausage (pictured: sunny-side eggs and thick-sliced bacon). I have never had pancakes like this in my life - crispy, buttery outer layer enveloping a warm, fluffy interior. And did I mention that the pancakes are HUGE! The syrup comes in these cute little glass bottles, too. The thick-sliced bacon has a smoky, savory pork flavor that perfectly compliments the pancakes. I can't wait to order this again! Rating: 5/5  Cast Iron Pressed Maple Jam N' Bacon Burger starts with two patties topped with maple pepper bacon, Colby cheese, maple onion jam, and finished with lettuce and tomatoes. If this seems like too much meat for you, you can opt for a single burger patty, too. The hubby had a huge appetite after driving for so long. The burger patties are juicy with a great balance of salty, sweet, and smoky flavor. I love that Cracker Barrel uses Colby cheese. You don't see it very often and it has a wonderful gooey, creamy texture. Cole slaw is my hubby's favorite side at Cracker Barrel. It is flavorful with just enough dressing on it so it's not dry. Fries are crispy but fluffy inside. Rating: 4.5/5  All-American Apple Pie is served with no sugar added and topped with premium vanilla ice cream. This has to be one of the best apple pies I have ever had. It is all about the crust! The crust tastes homemade like my Dad's. The apples are just sweet and tart enough and work well with the sweet, creamy vanilla ice cream. Rating: 5/5  Chocolate Pecan Pie (seasonal) is topped with premium vanilla ice cream. We don't see pecan pie in SoCal very often but the name \"Chocolate Pecan\" piqued my interest. This is also the second time I've ever had pecan pie. It is delectable, but the combination of pecans and chocolate reminded me of a good chocolate granola bar. It's a yummy choice, but my favorite is still the All-American Apple Pie. Rating: 4/5",

The wait wasn't very long at all for a Sunday afternoon, but the service and food was God awful. Hostesses at the hostess stand we're NOT welcoming, after being seated, we were greeted and she took our orders.   All of our orders came with grits, when she came back with our main entree she stated, \"oh I forgot the grits\" and after a pause she asked us, \"did you guys even want them ?\" She placed meals all over the table, handed us plates for us to grab from across the way. It was just a total mess.   After a few minutes I smelled a really strong odor. Smelled like a dirty wet rag. I thought oh maybe it was just one of the bus boys/girls wiping down a table and passing by with the rag. The stench did not go away. Really weird but I ended up smelling the table and my plate to see if maybe it was just a dirty table or dish. I found out the smell was actually coming from my small bowl of grits, after I took a bite. I almost threw up. The bowl smelled so foul. I ended up bringing it to the waitresses attention where she brought me another bowl, but that bowl also smelled really bad. I ended up going without my grits. My ham from the sunrise sampler tasted like I opened up a can of dog food, and the sausage patty could've been throw on a hockey field. I've never had a sausage patty like this, it was pink on the inside and the texture was really off, im surprised it was edible.. The only thing I was able to down was my over easy eggs and the hash brown casserole.  I've been to a couple of Cracker Barrel's out in the east coast years ago, and I don't remember it being this bad. The quality of the food is so bad, idk if a prisoner would even want to eat it. This is the last time I'll be dining at Cracker Barrel.",

I was not familiar with this restaurant since they do not have any Southern California. It's a big chain restaurant with plenty of seating.   Food was okay, but vegetarians/vegans beware because most of the veggies are prepared in pork broth since this is SOUTHERN style cooking. I had the fish and it was fine. The biscuits are EXCELLENT!  Prices are reasonable. Staff is helpful and friendly.   Overall, in case you have no food restrictions then quite a variety of options to choose from. If I come back, it would probably be to try the breakfast selection and for the biscuits! :)",

He was charismatic, knowledgeable, was gentle on the up-sale, but made it inviting and worthy of recognition of his approach. The food was most definitely 5 Stars, but the service I received was a 10 Star Quality. Greeted immediately, perhaps it was timely... Seated immediately... Made to feel welcome like Southern Hospitality. I travel extensively and no, I have never been to a Cracker Barrel... In fact I have always just kept my tires rolling. But this experience will have me pumping my brakes and plotting them into my GPS if this is normalcy. If you are a foodie... I am sure you already know this spot. If you are a newbie looking for Southern Cooking... I suggest you click on Google and find a Cracker Barrel near me. I don't recall the fancy name of what I ate, but I will say this... It was Bacon, Sausage Patties, 3 Eggs, some insane variation of Hash Browns made of MAGIC \"Loaded Hash Browns Baked\"... I think it was Potatoes, Cheese, Bacon, and something creamy milled together in some wicked scrumptiousness to die for. Their biscuits were yummy with butter and honey... And then they had this madness called Buttermilk Pie... \"Heaven\". I did go with a friend of mine from Virginia and I know that she loves the French Toast and my Girlfriend ate the Country Fried Steak.  Biggest love find from these guys the Loaded Hash Browns Baked. My server was Julio... and he was EXTRAORDINARY at his job. It's been a long, long, long-time since I got premium quality service of this caliber. So, YES! I RECOMMEND THIS ESTABLISHMENT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SERVER TOO. If I were to return to this place in Arizona... This will be a must location to indulge in wonderfully delightful dinning and service. PS: They have really cool stuff in the store portion to purchase. That being said, I covered my eyes past the cash register. :) Next trip, I will be feeling crazy and browse a while...

    "text": "I honestly only come for breakfast but if you've got a group looking for a southern style meal then head over to the C.B. As it's a family style restaurant.  The wait use to be the issue for me but now you can go online to put your name on the waitlist so when u show up you aren't caught up in store buying a bunch of stuff (or trying not to break stuff)   Overall food is good and comes out pretty quick. The congestion of people in the store or just the tables when eating can be a bit overwhelming. I'm a bit of a germ sensitive person so I gotta wipe down that Peg game (addictive game) and do wish they could do more to clean the tables and floors, but so much traffic it's hard to do without having a bucket out mopping or cleaning.   I can never figure out the rules for bread (maybe for dinner request, but we always ask for it. Cornbread, biscuits, butter and jam...  Additional Bottles of syrup available on request and I have to admit the staff seems to work together to support each other.   Cleanliness is a priority for me so would like to see more done to improve overall restaurant & restrooms... I want it to feel more like s restaurant and not a truck stop country store.",

They're runny so I have to order them \"done well\" which to them means brown. :( The best thing they have is the hashbrown casserole but there is no consistency. Sometimes it's over done, sometimes soupy, sometimes the onions are twice the size, etc... Oh and the prices keep going up while the portions get smaller.

I suppose I am just spoiled by the amazing Cracker Barrel chains in the South that I've experienced, but this place doesn't hold a candle.  I ordered breakfast, which was just alright. I ordered Cheesy Grits and they were terrible - under cooked, no flavor whatsoever, and just had cheese on top. Gross.  The pancakes I ordered were no better. They were covered in oil... to the point where I could squeeze the pancake and have it drip oil. I abandoned them after a couple of bites.  The staff was super friendly, so plus one for that, but this is by far the worst experience I've had at this chain... ever.  I don't think I will come back.",

It's an interesting chain because it's one of the only ones I know of that have the old timey theme.  The front of the restaurant is a \"country store\" selling knick knacks, road trip items, penny candy and some plain odd-ball crap.  The decor is all clap board, complete with an old porch, rocking chairs and barrels to play checkers on while you wait.  The walls are hung with what I assume is partially authentic paraphanelia from the 40's such as old rolling pins, spice cans, signs etc.    There was normally a short wait or no wait at all.  This review is based only eating breakfast.  The ex had no interest in their lunch or dinner items.  Their biscuits are solid, the gravy is okay but could use more flavor if I'm burning my calorie quota, the applesauce, grits, pancakes and eggs... all okay.  Being a potato freak, of course, I LOVE the cheesy potato hash!    Like the other reviewers here mention, it's a solid performer.  Always consistent.  Always the same.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  One of those places safe to bring your family to for a Sunday meal or out of towners hungry for breakfast.  The sort of place you'd be likely to see in the background of your kids' early photos.  Oh yeah, and they have peg games to play on every table.",

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten at Cracker Barrels since 1986 when we moved from Chicago to Chattanooga, TN. A few years later, we migrated to Boynton Beach in South Florida. In 1998, we moved to Phoenix. Luckily every where we've lived in 31 years, there's been a Cracker Barrel.  They used to have a rewards card but stopped that years ago. Being from the Midwest, we discovered their fried okra, hash brown casserole, grits, pecan pancakes, real maple syrup, chicken fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, and sawmill gravy with biscuits. Be sure to ask your server when you order, for apple butter to put on some biscuits. It's delicious! Save room for warm blackberry cobbler a la mode for dessert. Afterwards plan on burning some calories walking around Cracker Barrel's country store brimming with old- fashioned candy, jars of certain food items, their real Vermont maple syrup, books on audio tape and a trade-in program from store to store, Yankee candles, jewelry, greeting cards, tshirts, unusual seasonal decorative items only found at Cracker Barrels, attractive tops for women, old time toy section for children, old time sodas in a cooler, etc. There's a clothing discounted rounder in the back of the stores with a variety of clothing items-- tshirts, blouses, skirts, capes, etc. Allow a little time to sit a spell and enjoy the Cracker Barrel (CB) rockers outside on the front covered patio, too. The service is always good and the teamwork they demonstrate is incredible! A server is always walking down the aisles with coffee or tea pitchers asking if they can fill your drinks (even if they're not your server). I took a friend of mine to CB for the first time about 3-4 weeks ago. Amazing! If you've never eaten at a Cracker Barrel before, please look for the nearest one in your area. There's one on Chandler Boulevard just West of the I-10 overpass. The manager and staff there are very friendly and make your dining experience a pleasant one. The fireplace is going during these cool months, too.",

On a day of a craving, I hopped in the car, drove to this location and ordered my tradition: country fried steak, fried okra, biscuits, steak fries, mashed potatoes, and crumble for dessert.

It was freezing. I think because, they had all the fans on and it was only 52 outside. This is why only 4 stars,it was sooooo cold. Anyway, our food was excellent! Stephanie was our waitress, she was great! We ordered Breakfast even though it was 1pm.  They will give you either one,breakfast or lunch. Another great thing about them.

The waiter never refilled my Wife's drink, no checked to see if she needed a refill. I asked 3 different times for condiments for the sides, only to receive them after I asked the third time.

We waited probably over twenty minutes and I wasn't happy when I saw we were going to be sat at a table literally right behind the hostess booth where everyone walks in. Whatever. Let's just eat!   I decided to try one of the special new items, some cinnamon roll type french toast that comes with eggs and meat, I ordered sausage patties and scrambled. When our drinks came our waitress didn't know which glass had sprite or water and we all had to taste what was given to us to find which was sprite. Then she messed up the order and there was an extra scrambled egg and bacon plate, but when I saw my dish it looked like they cracked an egg and split it in half then scrambled the half portion it was so small. So before she took the extra scrambled egg plate back to the kitchen to either throw away or give to another party I just asked if I could have them since my egg looked like barely anything. She did the right thing by giving into my request. It didn't matter though, because the eggs were flat and very salty. The sausage tasted odd. The only thing I enjoyed was the french toast and it was almost too sweet so I didn't finish.  Since some of the family members hadn't seen each other in awhile we sat for some time after we finished eating just chatting and catching up, and a few of us noticed we were getting some rude looks from the staff and management as if to say, \"ok you're done get up and leave so we can get more customers in here to make us more money!\"  Alright, we left, and we won't be back.",

    "text": "We were going up to Phoenix and decided to have a late breakfast about 11.00 AM.  After debating where to go perusing mentally  through the usual chain restaurants, Denny's, IHOP etc. we decided to give Cracker Barrel a shot.  The place was very crowded and had to wait 15min.  Not too bad.  We figured it would be slow service once we got seated.  No problem.  A waitress came right over to us and took our order.  They have huge selections of interesting breakfast combos as well as lunch choices even before noon.   I got the 2 scrambled eggs with 3 dry crispy slices of bacon, it came with a wonderful light yogurt parfait with nuts, raisins, fresh fruit.  I had some of my husband's pancakes which I believe it was about 4 huge ones with his order of 2 eggs, bacon and it came with the pancakes.  Very reasonably priced.  Food came in about 10 minutes.  Nice and hot and really very very good. The little country store is adorable and fun to walk through it.",

It's been a long time since I came to one (10 years) and it was in Wisconsin.  They ran out of chicken and mashed potatoes so I swore I would not return but here I am at the bequest of my son wanting fried chicken!  At first glance there was no dinner menu - luckily the waitress saw our confusion and went to get the right one!  (Automatic star for her!)  One silverware kit for two people.   Ordering:  1) Friday Fish Fry  - only will order if there is malt vinegar! - comes with fries, coleslaw and biscuit or corn bread. REVIEW: 4/5 stars - not very crispy a little soggy but not too bad!  2) Country fried chicken (cannot be changed) - all bone in, no tenderloins - side: mashed potatoes - side: steamed broccoli REVIEW: 3.5/5 stars - mostly greasy and breaded not much meat at all.  But great flavor! - side mash: almost rock solid no fluff here! - broccoli - typical steamed veg. No flavor but NOT over cooked!  3) Sides to try: - Mac and cheese - mashed potatoes REVIEW: mash- 5/5 prob my favorite nice and flavored!  4) 2x Stewart's root beer (only available in bottles)",

    "text": "Went on a Friday morning around 6:15 AM. There were about a dozen cars in the lot so I knew they were open and already busy. I was immediately greeted by the cashier who said she would alert the hostess someone was waiting.  At least FIVE minutes later, and only when a server came out of the kitchen and glanced towards the hostess station, did she come over and ask if I was waiting to be seated. Given I was absolutely the only person there, that might  might suggest I was waiting to be seated. After she ascertained I was in fact waiting, she took me to a table, left a menu and a napkin wrapped bundle of silverware (some of it seemed a but sketchy), took my drink order and disappeared.  After delivering food to another table, she dropped off my drinks. On her another trip she stopped and took my order.  After ordering and as I was moving all of the various advertising items placed on the table out of the way, I discovered there was enough dried stuff on the table top that it felt very much like a topography map. I used my knife to scrape as much of the dried detritus in front of me. Whoever the person on nights or the early mornings that was tasked with cleaning all of the tables definitely overlooked this one. In addition the table top looked as if it really needed to be sanded down and refinished, mainly because it looked just like the old barn wood they adorn the walls with.  The food arrived fairly quickly, it was exactly as ordered and was hot off the griddle. The only issue I had with my meal, was the pinkish and strangely flavored sausage (?) patty. Having grown up in the Midwest, my recollections of sausage patties are that they were never pinkish in color nor did they taste like burnt wood. Perhaps it is a southern thing, but to my taste buds that wasn't sausage.   The server was very friendly and checked in on me a couple more times before leaving the bill.   I know Cracker Barrel is celebrating its 50th anniversary, but I do not believe this actual restaurant has been there for 50 years, however the dining room looks as if no meaningful updating has been performed since it opened.  This location is difficult to access if you are traveling  west on I-10 (its on Chandler Blvd but there is no exit for Chandler Blvd off I-10 West). This morning, after dropping my wife off at the airport, as I was headed back home on I-10 east, there is a Chandler exit. The restaurant is just west of the Chandler Blvd. exit ramp.",

Customer service was Eh.., the food was not the best honestly I could've gone to Denny's and had better and that's sad cause I had high hopes that they would be good. Especially since it was my first time taking the kids here. The bacon was pretty good and my son's pancakes. However I ordered the country fried chicken steak,  never again. Why don't they ever season their food? Why? The gravy tasted like powder, the biscuit was dry and please don't get me started on the eggs. Needless to say I didn't finish all of my food. I won't be returning not in this lifetime anyway.",

You know your in the right place because of the different kinds of rocking chairs outside as part of their decorations which they also sells.   Also, their interior is also superb. They have all kinds of antique stuff, from paintings, furniture and classic everyday things. I really like their designs.  Just having a glance at the menu, you can see that the prices are reasonable. I ordered a peach pancake and my bf ordered a traditional breakfast style with grits. If you get the traditional breakfast it will come with all the fixin. It was my first time having a grits and didn't even know what it was. It was like a fine grained oatmeal.  All the food we ordered taste delicious. Will come back here again to taste the othef dishes.",

This was our second year (but ordering from different locations) choosing Cracker Barrel. And, frankly the last after yesterday's meal.   My grievance doesn't lie with the ordering and pick-up process. It lies with the food. I ordered ham, turkey, dumplings, mashed potatoes, stuffing, biscuits and corn bread, and cranberry sauce. The turkey was very dry and tasteless. It needed less time roasting and more seasoning. The cornbread stuffing had too much celery salt to the point it was inedible. Everything else from the gravy and dumplings had a layer of thick gelatin. I'm with you. I just puked in my mouth reliving the experience. The best part was the ham- which was thrown in as a sampler. It had great flavor.  For $73 it was not worth it. Not worth a penny.   It may have been this CB location, but regardless I'm choosing a new place next year. Or choose the most traditional way and make and serve it up at home.",

This past week after a day of activity I decided to stop with my wife to have dinner at this Cracker Barrel store on Chandler Boulevard. Prior to having dinner at the restaurant we just stopped in the restrooms and we were both apalled at the condition of these facilities. The ladies restroom had no toilet paper in the stalls the trash barrel was overfilled and there was paper and trash all over the floors. The men's restroom was a little better but was not in usable condition. We decided to have an entree meal both of us had chicken fried chicken for dinner. The chicken fried chicken was nothing more than a piece of chicken breast cooked with gravy. The mashed potatoes were tasteless and the vegetables look like they were directly out of a can. Having had this meal many times at many of these Cracker Barrel restaurants I found this meal to be totally unacceptable and not the quality we have normally received at other restaurants. Overall The service was good but the meal and the condition of the facility was unacceptable. We will go to another Cracker Barrel in the valley sometime in the future to see if this is something that is conducive of all the restaurants or only at this local facility.",

The menu at CB was way too big to make an educated order so I just winged it.   My breakfast arrived in eight mins. The biscuits were small but fluffy and the gravy was average. The sausage was really good and added a nice flavor to the meal.   Cracker Barrel prides themselves on old, country atmosphere: slat wood walls, oak tables and brick floors.

    "text": "Cracker Barrel is one of those places I have been eating at for many, many years, but unfortunately, I feel their quality is going down and their prices going up.  On our last visit, the service was as good as it gets - they get an A+ on service.  I ordered the 4 vegetable plate and substituted 2 veggies for a baked potato and a dinner salad.  One of the veggies was green beans - the bowl was not heaped high like it used to be - I ate the entire contents with two bites.  The potato came with butter and a packet of sour cream - no bacon, no chives, no cheese - this was a big change from the past and I felt like I was totally ripped off.  Wendy's has a sour cream and baked potato for a buck.  The salad was small and had lettuce, tomato and that's it.  No onion, etc or anything - plain.  My total bill for my plate was 12 dollars.  I won't be going back anytime soon, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite places to eat.  My husband and I have eaten at Cracker Barrel many times at the Chandler Blvd. location and in various states we've visited.  However, today was not a good experience.  We went in the afternoon to eat at Cracker Barrel and Hoops was our server.  The food took triple the time it usually takes to get your food.  Hoops said that there was a new cook.  I ordered the Haddock Dinner.  As one of my sides, I selected a baked potato.  My husband ordered the Chicken & Dumplings Dinner.  The food was excellent but the service was not so good.  The place was not real busy since it was the afternoon.  When we received our check, my Haddock Dinner was more than I expected.  I asked another server if there was an upcharge for a baked potato.  She said yes.  I said that I didn't order a loaded baked potato and in the past I've never been charged for a baked sweet potato.  I was charged $1.50 extra for the baked potato.  The server never said anything about the baked potato being an extra charge.  I spoke with my server Hoops and told her about our disappointing experience.  She said, do you want me to get my manager.  At first, I said no.  Then, I thought that if no one ever says anything, nothing will change.  I spoke with the manager in the red shirt and glasses about our experience.  He did not seem to be concerned.  I paid our bill at the counter and left.  In the future, we'll think twice before going to Cracker Barrel to eat.  I would have completed an online survey at the Cracker Barrel website but I didn't receive a receipt from the cashier.",

The breakfast reminded me so much of my Great Aunt's old kitchen...nothing beats comfort food (you're welcome to use that Cracker Barrel for a small fee :-))  Although the Breakfast was amazing, it was also recommended to us to try the Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes on our next trip so I can't wait!",

The last visit I ordered the fried shrimp and I was pleasantly surprised.  This did not seem like the regular fried shrimp you get anywhere else.  It was seasoned and pretty delicious.  It also came with three hushpuppies.  I don't usually like hushpuppies, but these were good.  Did I mention yet that I also got three sides?  Whoa!  Lots of food.  I have to admit, though, that CB is not my favorite place to go.  I don't want to know about the calorie or fat intake here.  But DD loves getting a single pancake with fried apples on top... and I don't blame her.    I know a lot of people don't like their biscuits, but they are one of my favorite parts of eating here.  Just a half biscuit (or three) with a little blackberry jam could make me completely satisfied for days.  Okay, I exaggerate.  But I love their biscuits.  Please don't tell me how fattening they are.  I don't care!  The only thing I don't understand is: why aren't there omelets on the breakfast menu?!  P.S. The turkey sausage is quite good.  I don't eat pork, so maybe I am not the best judge, but even DH likes their turkey sausage.",

The grits were absolutely disgusting and an embarrassment to have been served.  I have to admit, I wasn't totally surprised - we're nowhere near the actual south.

Omg it was very good!  Everything on their menu looked so good or was hard to decide.  We were given a plate of corn bread and soft biscuits, with butter and honey.  Very yummy, soft and moist.  As for their menu, there's so many to choose from.  Its def a southern comfort type of place.  I ended up ordering their chicken fried chicken, for their din plates you get a choice of 3 sides.  I got their Mac n cheese, mash, and corn.  It was very delicious and filling.  For those trying to watch your weight or wanting to eat more healthy, they have a section on their menu on the lighter side for calories.

The biscuits, which use to be light, golden brown, and fluffy, are now HARD, over-done, and inedible (not to mention they're extremely stingy with the jam).  The scrambled eggs (which I have) are hard, over-cooked, and cold.  We ask for crispy bacon and it comes out limp (and once again, cold).  My biggest gripe is the Diet Coke!  The Diet Coke at Cracker Barrel is ALWAYS FLAT!  Not sometimes, A L W A Y S!!!!!  I think the warm liquid is poured over the ice, which makes it flat - just a guess.  In short, my favorite place has turned into the worst.  We won't take friends there any more, and we certainly won't be going back.",

She had a fun vibe to her and she recommended the fried chicken special which most of us took. It was delicious just as she promised it would be. Constantly kept checking on our table and seeing if we needed anything or refills.   Food: it was nice they were still offering breakfast menu at dinner as my Son was dying for some breakfast items.   The young lady (Elizabeth?) who checked us out (food bill and a few store items we purchased) greeted us with a smile and treated us in a way that made you want to come back.  Overall great experience end-2-end.",

Now this is only my second time here and i vaguely remember the first time so i ordered the chile jack chicken, hashbrown casserole, steak fries,  and side salad for $9.79. The food was out in about 7 minutes, if that.  The chicken was decent but the chiles and cheese on top made it taste like an omelet... Very odd.  The fries were raw on the bottom of a handful of them. Hashbrown casserole looked leftover and microwaved.  The salad was ok, but very soggy and no crisp to it.  The service however  was great and she was very knowledgeable.  It was also pretty clean in there as well.",

Hands down some of the best pancakes I've had and that's saying a lot - wink!  I usually don't eat pancakes, but sometimes you just gotta carb load.  If I'm not mistaken they make and bottle their own maple syrup. Served warm this combination of the goowy sticky syrup and pancakes is music to my palate!  Along with pancakes I order their Eggs in a Hole - over easy of course.  Yummy ooze of egg yolk flows through my hash browns and the crispy bacon!  Mmmmm...I can't wait for the next trip.  Might just have to go somewhere so I can go to Cracker Barrel!    Overall, the service here is always excellent.  The place is built like some old cabin with some Midwest flare -- We ain't in Kansas!?  They sell really random things in their store front from shirts, candles, stuffed animals and books....I get confused, but maybe I just need another cup of Joe. - Enjoy!",

A great perk about Cracker Barrel is that they have a store full of cute nic nacs and you can be shopping around while you wait for a table. During holiday season, they have adorable ornaments and I purchased a few to spice up my  tree.  When we finally got to a table, we ordered the chicken fried chicken with hashbrown casserole, overmedium eggs, and a maine blueberry pancake with blueberry syrup.  Once we got our order, I bit into the chicken and it tasted stale.  The hashbrown casserole was good, eggs are usually always good, and the pancake was ok.  Now that I've been exposed to the better breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, this place just doesn't do it for me anymore.  I was quite disappointed. The place was packed with people - and I used to remember thinking that it was because of the \"great\" food.  Now I am just thinking it's probably one of the best breakfast joints in this area. Besides, who wants to drive half an hour away if you live in Chandler to somewhere else only to be waiting for another hour? I am so glad I live in Central Phoenix because this place will not pop up on my 3 mile proximity radar.",

Grits - good Collard greens - good Dumplins - really good Chicken in the chicken n dumplins -  s'alright. The chicken is clearly cooked separately from the dumplins and it's apparent in the flavor and appearance.

We made sure to give plenty of time so we were here by 10 in the morning which our flight wasn't until two in the afternoon plenty of time to make sure we have our meal without rushing. We have to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Monday morning, the lobby which there is none so we waited outside until our names were called. We were sat at our table, along with three other tables that were sat around us at the exact same time. It took our waiter 15 minutes just to come and say hi and ask if we want to drinks. By the time our drinks came back which was another 10 minutes, we were ready to place our order which we did. If you minutes went by, and then we started to notice the tables that sat down after us Headstart to receive their meals. We asked the waiter which we finally got his attention after 15 minutes of trying to flag somebody down. He said he would return, of course he did not. I then asked to speak to a manager which promptly a manager did show up. He checked on our meals which we discovered at that time where never placed, at that time it was realize we have been there for almost an hour with no food one drink and a lot of frustration. I have always wanted to come to a Cracker Barrel, but now no I will never return to one due to the lack of service I received at this location. I am sure other locations are much better and you give better service, but I will not take that opportunity to find out due to the lack of service from the staff here at this location.  On a sidenote yes the manager was willing to give us a free meal which I was not willing to take because I do not want to wait anymore time for a meal to arrive.",

I ordered the rib eye steak and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as I asked. My husband had the chicken fried chicken.  The gravy on the chicken was flavorful and creamy. Now the biscuits. .the biscuits are to die for! Warm, light and fluffy!   We came in the next day just to order breakfast. The pancakes yummy!..a llittle crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. With just a little bit of butter..thats all it needed  From the hostess that seated us to our server, they were very personable and welcoming. Not to mention our order was exactly as requested.  Anytime I see a cracker barrel you can be sure I will be stopping!",
