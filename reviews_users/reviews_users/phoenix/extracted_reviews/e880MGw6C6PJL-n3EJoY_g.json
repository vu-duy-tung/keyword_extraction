I LOVE their limeade and have often wished I could just order the whole pitcher and leave the place with it.  I'm a big fan of the chicken pita with loads of Feta, caramelized onions and chicken.  I know I should probably branch out and try something new, but nothing beats the limeade and chicken pita with pasta salad.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the chocolate cake!",

An assortment of sandwiches, sides and salads are on hand for the taking. Well, you can't just take them... you have to pay, of course. I don't want to be blamed when a rash of sandwich robberies breaks out along the McDowell corridor... but I've gotten off on a tangent again.  I've only ever tried the Gruben. I think I need an umlaut there too. No? We're good? Good. Like a Reuben but with fresh cabbage and turkey. Much healthier, and with a tangy kick. A good quick place to grab a sandwich during your lunch break.  Zoe's sides are available by the pound (chicken, potato, pasta, tuna and egg salads). They will cater your next event and if you've ever seen those Honda Elements running around Phoenix with Zoe's name plastered along the sides, you know that they deliver. Or maybe you're under the impression that those cars are actually mobile kitchens. Well, that's just silly.",

More bright colors. Pretty cool. The menu was a bit limited, but we were still game. Not too much for vegetarians; my girlfriend ordered pasta salad. I ordered a Gruben sandwich, and we sat down. What happened next was discomforting....  I had to use the restroom, but someone was in it, so I stood outside of it for a minute. I heard the toilet flush, and then the door promptly opened. PROMPTLY opened. And out comes a kitchen worker for Zoes. Eeewww!! There is no way he had time to wash his hands in the 3 seconds between flush and door opening. Hmm...!  I wasn't long in the restroom, and when I sat back down my sandwich was made, so I'm relatively sure the non-handwasher didn't touch my sandwich. And the sandwich was actually pretty good tasting; but I cannot forgive a restaurant worker NOT washing his hands after using the restroom. Isn't that a law or something? I'd give this place a 1-star, but I kind of liked the sandwich and the staff was friendly. Nevertheless, I will probably not be back.",

Yes, the food came fast, and you order at the counter, but I've just always thought of it as more \"healthy food fast\" but that's not quite a general category is it?  I love to grab Zoe's.  Coincidentally, I like Feta, because as Lali mentioned, you have to like Feta to like Zoe's.  By brother was initially hesitant, but found himself craving Zoe's, and Feta after our last visit so I say to give it a try and don't be afraid.  The menu is SO simple it can be a bit shocking.  Salad, pita, kabobs, grilled chicken plate.  Pretty much any combo of chicken w/ veggies - even in their soup.  I really appreciate that they have a kids menu that isn't filled with things like french fries and chicken fingers.  They may give in to PB&J, but the rest of it will be just as healthy as what the adults are eating.    Last but not least - I love the modern/simple decor.  The \"kids\" paintings scattered around the place are pretty cool too!",

Both are pretty much just meat, mayo, and salt/pepper/spices, I think. No onions and no mustard make me a happy chicken/tuna salad eater! I also love their pimento cheese, feta slaw, and potato salad. The chocolate cake, though, is what hooked me onto Zoe's in the first place. It is basically a Texas sheet cake - moist, not too overpoweringly chocolatey, with that boiled fudge frosting that soaks in and seals in the goodness of the cake. {Droooool}",

The \"Gruben\" is my favorite (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye bread), but chicken roll-ups are a close second.  They offer a great selection of sides, and the fruit is always fresh. The limeade is so worth it in my opinion, though I don't think you get refills on that.  (Note if you buy a big cup you can bring it back for a deal on the limeade.)  Also note that if you check in on your Yelp phone app, Zoe's gives 10% off; every 3 check-ins gets you a free piece of chocolate cake. I'm a fan of the cake as are many others, though my wife didn't care for it.  Oh, and the parking: very tough to get right now with the construction next door. If you wait a few minutes you should get a space in the lot and won't have to park around the corner. (I haven't tried parking in the costume store lot.)",

As I typically do, I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions, and your choice of a side (I chose their rice-yummy) and their greek salad. The salad is always huge so I usually save it for its own meal later. Their salad comes with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good. We also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good, itself, but I like to put the dressing on it, too. My husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome. My brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it, too. The food is fresh and you feel you are eating healthy. The prices are average for most places, nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty good deal when you can make two meals out of it. Oh yeah, their fountain lemonade was out when I went but my husband recommended I try their freshly squeezed limeade behind the counter. I am a huge fan of limes and this was absolutely delicious. Not too tart or too sweet, just perfect. Love, love, love Zoes.",

I had the Spinach wrap (something rather) and it was really good. The picture of it makes it look like a much bigger portion, but for once I wasn't annoyed by that, because it was still filling.  It also came with a side, which I got pasta salad, which was really good too in my opinion, and I'm pretty picky about pasta salads! It's not your \"typical\" pasta salad, but it's flavorful.  I took the advice of the worker and put some dressing on the salad (dressing found on all the tables) and that added a little zing to it too.    Very good service too, all of the people were really nice, and genuinely nice, not the fake stuff .  I would go there again!",

Might as well enjoy a free meal and see if there have been improvements made. I called and placed a to-go order, which was the same item I always get, the tuna salad sampler. When you call Zoes, they have your phone number in their computer, which tells the person answering what you typically order. So I go into the restaurant, impressed by the new look of Zoes. The floors and tables were clean (Awesome!) and they have new furniture, which has created a warmer feeling in the dining room. The girl who took my order and cashed me out was pleasant and very excited about my free lunch coupon. She was endearing. I left the restaurant with a smile on my face! I get back to work and open the box and...it was the wrong menu item. SNAP. I was so excited. I call back and let them know I was returning to get the correct menu item. When I returned to Zoes, the women who I believe to be the manager, barely grunted at me while handing me my food. No sorry, no please excuse the inconvenience, no nothing. So, A-OK.",

The food was brought out rather quickly.  The food: The sign lied to me.  It did not rock.  It was more like listening to Enya.  Shredded lettuce, tomato, ordinary chicken salad on regular store bought bread.  The potato salad was also rather bland.  Atmosphere: There were a lot of people and some nice music to go along with the chatter.  It had an exposed ceiling with large windows that faced McDowell.  The place gave off a nice downtown hipster vibe.  I gave the place an extra star because of the atmosphere.  Conclusion: Not quite as good as Paradise Bakery but, better pricing and atmosphere.  I will come back but, I will order something else.",

Their menu didn't seem that unique, but the girl who took our order was extremely friendly and offered some advice on her favorites, which included a pita and for both of us to get sides of the pasta salad. For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful. When our food was brought to us, my pita already was torn all the way down, so there was no way I was going to be able to manuever eating it with my hands. I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife.  Flavors were good, nothing special. Chicken was dry, and the pasta salad was nothing I would write home about.  We left full, somewhat pleased, but could have had the same experience for half the price.",

Comes with two huge scewers of chx, peppers, cherry tomatoes... over a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  Pretty delish.  The Gruben Sandwich is also a hit.

    "text": "Went here for dinner last night for the first time. The desserts and packaged foods looked DELICIOUS.   I am picky about meat (like I don't like biting into tendons and things I don't want to eat) so the chicken kabobs were a little iffy (I bit into things I didn't want to eat), but they were seasoned well.   The rest of the food was very fresh. The greek salad that I got as a side was great!! A ton of feta cheese on mine, really clean lettuce. The side of rice was great, too.   I am gluten-free, so I had to pass on the pita bread, but that looked really good, too.   The food was a little simple for my taste, but not bad. I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of my food preferences, but others may love it.   They serve you on disposable plates and cups with plastic silverware, so it's a very simple restaurant.   Another person in my party got a chicken pita, but it looked like it was only a half pita stuffed with chicken. I personally would have wanted two halves, but I guess I eat a lot...  Worth a try once if you like fresh food, pitas, veggies and kabobs. It's a good place to stop in to try something quick and new.  Overall, good, but I prefer the restaurants around the area though- there is a Habit Burger, Five Guys, etc that I would prefer.",

Lots of salads and meals that are low on carbs and heavy on veggies and meat.  The beef they use is not good though.  The beef kabobs are really, really chewy.  I grew up with cheap beef and it is my style, but I know a lot of people would be very disappointed.  Learn how to do beef better.  I'm sure you've already lost customers with that stuff.  I'll get the chicken next time.",

It was difficult to find parking, but I managed to snag a space (in the lot next door...shhhh don't tell!). Anyway, it was easy enough to order, although none of their dishes really screamed at me (most of them sounded ok, but not great). At someone's suggestion, I ordered the chicken roll ups and they were alright. The chicken and the onions were good, but I think maybe the cheese or something in there made them taste just slightly off. Anyway, it was good, but I wouldn't run over there to get it. This place does get points for being fairly inexpensive and quick.",

The chicken tasted great, the greek salad it was served on was flavorful.  ***HOWEVER***  In an attempt to order, I stood DIRECTLY in front of a woman I presume was the manager for several minutes while she scribbled down a catering order as if her life depended on it. When she finally looked up, she pretended she hadn't seen me walk up (\"Oh, I didn't see you there...\" ...really?!? SO cliche, don't do all that, girl...) and implied I should have tried harder to make myself known. Thanks for the lesson on conducting myself socially , but NO THANKS.  The cherry on top of that experience was the latex glove I found buried in the greek salad on my second bite.   The food is good and most of the staff is friendly and attentive, but that woman!! She needs to be Gordon Ramsey-ed right in the face!",

I usually get the mediterranean  (sp?) tuna pita . it's a great soft pita filled with tuna, onions, capers and tomatoes. The tuna's mixed in with this oil and vinegar mixture, totally awesome! I sometimes will get the Greuben, which is a grlled reuben made with turkey and their home made slaw with feta!  My all time fave meal there is the Power Protein Plate, which is grilled chicken served with caramelized onions and a huge heap of the slaw!  They also have great sides like killer potato salad, pasta salad and the aforementioned slaw. If you're looking for a great pretty healthy spot to get lunch, check it out!",

Well, we enjoyed both of those things with Zoe's. First impression was with their delivery driver, he was extremely professional and thanked me for my business as he handed me my receipt. The food was absolutely delicious and just beautiful. It was exactly what I ordered. Then... it really blew my mind when I got a call from Nichole, at Zoe's, later that afternoon asking me how the food was and was everything how I ordered it and she asked me if I had any feedback. I was so impressed by their professionalism and a company that actually calls you to ask if they met your service standards. YES, Zoe's Kitchen on McDowell & 7th Ave in Phoenix you met all our services needs and then some.  Amazing food and staff!!",

Only complaint is that they seem to run out of veggies often (which is a side on the menu) and last time I was there it was probably about 7p and the girl didn't want to remake the tea because they closed soon and didn't want to waste it. While that was considerate for her work, it would've been nice to know before buying a drink. Also, her attitude could've been nicer as she literally was like \"yeah I'm not remaking anymore, it'll just get thrown away.\" They also had like two hours left of business and the restaurant was busy.",

So, you must excuse my inability to comment on this pimento cheese sandwich in relation to others. But,  holy fscking god, was this food good!  So good I came back the next day to get spinach rolls. Which were like spinach pie but in a crispy tortilla style roll served with some tomato based salsa. T'was fabulous!",

First impression - very commercial. Opposite of what I was looking for. Kind of depreciated my experience, since I prefer ma and pa types. Very clean and geometric, yet almost uncomfortable. Prices are average, and so is the food. Although, the people were friendly and quickly got my order to me.   Probably won't come back :(",

I felt so bad because I am one of the most patient people and I understand the restaurant business and time Next time we know about the online ordering and even the mobile app ordering  I got home and was very excited to eat my dinner and it was very tasty The pita had a great amount of grilled chicken & ham The potato salad was yummy as well  All in all, Zoe's kitchen is good in my book and the only head's up I would give to anyone is that this is a lovely sit down restaurant, very healthy and modern. The decor is very hip and modern and I really like the doors. It fits in well on the 7th Ave/Mcdowell strip   We will be back and hopefully next time we won't have to rush :)",

You know when people make their spaces look so modern it ends up just looking cheap... this place is not it.  The front door was a bit scary, if you don't watch your kids or immature friend or family members closely, it is possible that they could sever their body in half vertically.  Anyhow, I had the chicken roll ups, they were good.  The food is like food you can fix at home if you put some effort in it ( this means more than using the microwave or picking up take out and putting it on a plate).  The pita chips were very tasty too.  We got some of those.  The salads look big and green and healthy- the way a salad should look.  I plan to go back and I plan to get something different to try.  Neat concept, this Zoes.",

I have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice ....   Do you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes.   So, so sad!",

Anyway, I fall into the category of people who think the food induces yawning. I had the Greek Pita and there was nothing Greek about it. My chicken, though, was NOT dry at all...quite tasty by itself in fact. See, its not that the food here doesn't taste good, its just that its nothing special...a sandwich packed in your lunchbox is just as good as what I had here. This wrap tasted like the thousands of others I've had. (that's right, thousands)   I didn't read reviews before I went, and I did it on purpose. Its right down the street, they serve sandwiches, so I had decided that this is a place that I will find something to like about. Another place to add to my wall-of-menus. But...I will visit 2 more times for a total of 3. 3 strikes and you're out is fair, right?   On the plus side, even though the food was boring, it was still fresh. And if you scratch the dressing, it'll be healthy. But likewise if you scratch the dressing....you might fall asleep while eating.",

It's not the greatest food ever but they use a lot of feta and I love feta. I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.  Today, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice.   Will I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me.   Oh, and they didn't burn my sandwich alright. Actually (if I could take a picture I would) they barely heated it. The cheese is still mostly intact.",

I used to have a problem where I'd get home and find chicken added to it (a no-no for a vegetarian like me), but I haven't had that issue in about a year.  Nonetheless, I check it while I'm still there every time to make sure.  The salad is big and tasty (especially without those nasty olives or unnecessary potato salad glob at the bottom), and I feel like it's pretty healthy and low calorie.  The service is nice and pretty efficient, even during weekday lunch rush when it's a real challenge to find parking and maneuver around the lot without getting hit.  They don't even embarrass me about coming so often and ordering the same exact thing, haha.  The one thing I can say as a critique- they could be a bit more consistent on their salads.  Sometimes there is a ton of something, like lettuce or feta, and other times it's challenging to find it at all.  This place is solid.",

Also the grilled feta sandwhich is also a favorite. The feta can be a little much so I do take some of it out, but other than that I love it. The rice pilaf is lovely as well. I don't like that to substitue the greek salad as a side they charge you $3.00 extra dollars !! Outrageous. Also, on many times I have ordered the salad to go, have gotten back to work and realized they forgot to include dressing. Super annoying. But the manager gave me a free meal for the inconvenience.

Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a \"spinach quesadilla\" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.   Then I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.

I call in my order which is usually the Grilled Chicken plate and it's ready to be picked up in 10 minutes.  It does get crowded for lunch which is why I get it to go.  They even have To Go parking, so that's a plus!  Now the food!  Yummy!  Their grilled chicken is seasoned and cooked perfect every time.  They grill up some onions with it too which are heavenly!  I used to get their greek salad and add chicken which is a $2 add on, so this salad ends up costing almost $10, but I discovered a secret!  If you get the grilled chicken plate, it's basically the same thing (lil less salad, but you still get the side of your choice) and it only costs $8.  I recommend: -Ya Ya's chocolate cake is unbelievable! -The chicken salad sandwich is great! -For sides, I usually get the coleslaw, fruit, or the rice. -Chicken roll ups rock -Any of the pitas -Pita pizza is so original, filling, and delish! -Homemade limeade - there are no words for this drink, it's so good, you just have to try it!  Not worth it: -Pasta side is bland (but sometimes I get it and mix it in with my salad, yum) -The mediterranean tuna left me too stinky for work hours -Orzo soup was bland -The turkey is just deli slices of processed meat (not great compared to the chicken)  You can specialize anything on their menu too and they will get it perfect.  I have only  had 2 messed up orders the whole time I've been eating here.  The first time they forgot my side so they delivered a whole pint of it (they sell just the sides three too) to my work when they were on their way to deliver a catering order.  And they brought me a free chocolate cake to say they were sorry!  The second time, they forgot my salad dressing (which they also bottle and sell).  So I called to let them know, didn't have time on my lunch to run back, so they comp'd my meal for the next time... even my limeade!  Great customer service, food, and variety keeps me coming back to Zoe's!  They take care of their customers and the environment with the refillable cups they recently started.  Only $1 for refills!  Love it!  Did I say I love this place already?",

The chicken salad sandwich was bland. The chicken wrapped in tortilla with salsa was not very good. The salsa is really bad and very mild.  Chicken in the salad was overcooked yet nicely seasoned so that wasn't a big deal.  I would come back, but only for the Greek salad with the chicken and pita.",

The last 2times I came I was eating dirt with my salad. And don't dare even attempt to ask for the manager... her attitude is definitely not manager material. She can't even apologize to the continued mess ups. I hate to say it but I'm gonna have to find another Greek restuarant.",

We happened to come in on Saturday (Halloween) and even though there seemed to be a lot of traffic on the outside, the restaurant had nobody in line and only two tables seated when we walked in.   The food was good.  Simple entrees with lots of flavor.   I've been told that they have a pretty good turnaround on getting the food out to you during the week.  As they should if people are in there during their short lunch breaks.   It's possible that they were short on staff for this particular Saturday because we waited over 15 minutes for our food before they brought it to our table.  The portions don't look big but are very filling.  I couldn't finish my meal.  We didn't have trouble finding a parking spot.  There was a Security officer making sure that only cars that parked in their small lot were going to the restaurants next to them... Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, and Five Guys.   I will visit again.",

Though you could tell everyone was eager to get home (rightly so), they helped us with wonderful service, cheerful attitudes, and of course tasty food. I want to extend a heartfelt THANK YOU!!! My sister and I work in the food industry as well and know we were not the ideal customers given the time before closing and day-- yet this did not stop everyone from being kind and understanding. We will definitely be back (under better circumstances) to try more!   The hummus trio was very tasty, especially the pesto hummus with the crispier pita. Everyone loves the rice and greek salad as well. Only minor complaint would be the soup size for the price, but that's pretty common most places these days. Overall 5/5!",

I think their Greek salad is great.  It has veggies on it like cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper, and those pepperoncini peppers.  Their dressing is light and simple, which I love.  I can just order the side of Greek salad, which is like $2.80 and I feel pretty full after that.  But I usually also get a side pasta salad or side of hummus also.  The other stuff on the menu is not that great, nothing spectacular -- oh except for the chocolate cake!  I love that cake and the frosting they put on top which is thin and forms a slight crunchy crust on top.  My only complaint with the cake is that the slices are cut very inconsistently.  So sometimes I get small slices and sometimes I get huge slices.",

About 1 minute goes by and my co-worker gets her food. Simply delivered at the table with a \"sorry about that\" from the girl at the register.

For a twist on coleslaw, try their marinated slaw (greek dressing and feta cheese). I also recommend the green/hibiscus tea. The staff is friendly and the location is awesome.   Parking can be a challenge during peak times, and call ahead/website ordering has never really worked out for me here.

When you go in, grab a menu, pick your dish, go to the cash register to place your order, take a table topper number, sit and they will bring your food right out to you. Clean up after yourself, and enjoy the satiety of your meal. Don't wanna sit down? Get it to go, or place an order online for pick up, or get it delivered on Yelp ($2.99 delivery fee). So easy!   Gimme all the Kabobs at Zoe's! They are so good. I love the Basil Pesto hummus too. My new favorite: The Mediterranean Salad Trio Bowl. I usually get it with chicken. Peep the Macros: 47g protein, 7g sugar, 7g carbs, 38g fat (0g Trans fat), pretty sweet eh? Zoe's has all of their nutritional information on their website. Next I want to try the Cauliflower Rice Bowl, and the Power Grain Bowl.  My only gripe: The condiment station had really sad and crusty looking Tobasco bottles. I love my Tobasco, and was disappointed that each one had like 5 drops of hot sauce left in them. Pretty please, can you guys hook it up on the Tobasco?  Overall, Zoe's is great spot to grab lunch on the go. Service is always quick and friendly. I work down the street and I'm glad I have Zoe's as an option when I'm deciding on what to eat for lunch. They do catering too,  which I've had at work functions and it has always turned out great. Family meals are also an option if you don't have time to cook, but want something tasty and wholesome. If you love Mediterranean, try Zoe's!",

I will try the different locations to see if they're doing the same thing but if it happens again I am going to write corporate to let them know that they have slacked off on the quality and quantity of what they're providing especially for the cost you expect at least a half of a chicken breast not two or three strips and thin strips on top of that once you order an entree for there especially for the price.",

You can't pick a platter or a bowl of anything, you can't delete items in the card, you have to manually pick the kabobs 1 at a time and add the sides 1 at a time (no idea how they package this for group dining?) The bags are flimsy and will break if you try carrying too much - so you have to have 6 small bags for all your stuff and make 3 trips to the car where there  is horrible parking and everyone thinks you are leaving so they wait on you and you walk away from your car like multiple times and piss off folks who really need to park. I am not sure what I think of the new menu, but you can't just order the new chicken without sides, so I couldn't test it on my catering. These guys really need to look at how Panera does this - Panera ends up getting my catering business when I am too exhausted to fight the online ordering app at Zoe's. I should also say the bathroom was messy, the service was outstanding - the people are so nice who work here.  I'll keep trying because I like the food so much - so we'll see how it looks in a few months.",

My bowl didn't have cucumber slices, and the lamb was formed into balls, two of which were overcooked to where the plastic knife had a hard time cutting through the bottom of them.  While tasty, I'm not sure it was worth the $10.99 price.   It's doubtful if I'll be back (mainly since it's further away than I normally travel for eating out).",

It's simple, I ordered potato salad and I got chicken salad. But they had the nerve to put a \"potato salad\" label on it. At first, I thought it was tuna salad, they look the same...when I told the store this, they refused to refund me because \"we only sell potato and chicken salad\". OK WHATEVER, I obviously didn't get potato salad, so give me a freaking refund!! This store sucks consistently.  Update: Zoes Kitchen never resolved this, despite posting their bogus comment.

The bread my sandwich was served on could have been the same that I have sitting in my pantry at home, and it looked like all of the ingredients were fresh from home.

I thought Greek marinara meant code for the tzitiki (sic) sauce, but really it was red marinara... Greek maybe for the green seasoning on the chicken?

Especially for my fellow vegetarians.  But the tides have changed, my friends. Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.  Now for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options.   I had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch.   Soooooo tasty!  Now I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.  Two notable changes:  1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.  2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents. (cheaper than the vending machine at work still)  Either way, I'm compelled now to patronize this little spot more often. Next time I'm trying the new spinach wraps...mmmm",

Working with their sales manager Marissa made the whole process super easy. Their boxed lunches were great! I went with chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs and chicken green salads and was so impressed with the presentation. Delivery and set up was great! The delivery girls did have a spill and 2 veggie kabobs didnt make it but I appreciated that they were honest about it and I was refunded. Zoes had no problem in individually packaging all 110 of my orders. They even brought along some nifty coolers with ice for drinks and all of the necessary paperware/plasticware. They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good! The chicken was flavorful, the salad was refreshing. I was also very happy that I decided to order some of their cookies because they were such a big hit! Everyone at the event raved about the food, so I definitely know who to call the next time I have an event in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I am in love...with Zoe's grilled feta sandwich. Everytime my co-workers and I go for lunch, I always tell myself I am going to try something else on the menu...and then I don't because I don't want to cheat on the grilled feta. My sandwich is always toasted perfectly and the tomato on the sandwich helps tone down the feta just a touch. The pasta salad is my favorite of the sides to get. I tried the potato salad once and was not wowed by it at all. For almost $9 which buys a drink, sandwich, side and chips, I always leave contently full.  As a warning, if you don't like feta cheese, this may not be the place for you. About 99% of the items on the menu contain it.",

It's nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good (not great), it does the trick and won't break the bank.    I usually get the chicken salad sandwich which carmelized onions. My girlfriend always gets the protein plate which looks good too. Plus, every item comes with chips and a side of your choice (slaw, potato salad, pilaf, etc.)  My favorite part about Zoe's you ask? That Diet Dr. Pepper is part of the soda fountain selection.

    "text": "From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross.   We stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option.   Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara.   We sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!  It wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members.   As if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return.   My husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego. The only tasty part of his meal was the side of bagged chips!  I guarantee you that we won't be back to Zoe's Kitchen. We are huge fans of fast, casual, and fresh lunch food, but we found the food at Zoe's to be anything but.",

The \"sauce\" they put on the table (a greek dressing like substance) can almost make up for dryness of the chicken but not quite.  I considered giving them an extra star because there's a dude named Yoder that works there who I pretend is a Zen like sandwich master from the Dagobah system who holds the secret recipe to the delicious slaw they put on the Gruben.    It's a bit of a cluster-F at the drink/napkin area...too tight in there for people but the fact that they have Diet Dr. P in the fountain makes up for it.  Like Nicole T, I'm a sucker for the DDP.",

Luckily the decor is modern and compliments the menu well which makes eating in a pleasure.     My only down note is on the service. If you are not careful when you enter the restaurant, you may enter through the door of invisibility and will become invisible to the employees. As a result, you may stand at the counter while they work around you but do not recognize your presence until the invisibility dust (or whatever makes you invisible) wears off.  Based upon my late lunch experience today, the dust takes 4 iPhone e-mail responses or texts to be removed (10ish minutes). Regrettably, I only had three unanswered e-mails in my inbox and had to leave before I could be seen by the employees. On a positive note, when you leave (regardless of the time you waited), the invisibility dust seems to be removed. I know this as no one honked or screamed at my car as it drove away without a driver.",

When it comes down to it, this chain is no better than Chik-fil-a in what it offers. At least with Chik-Fil-A I get my food quickly and a nice side of cross-cut fries.  Zoe's Kitchen sits across the street from My Florist which, when you really think about it, was a dumb move on corporate's part. Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.  The food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.  There's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.",

I usually stick to the Greek chicken pita which I've had 3-4 times and it's kind of a hit in miss in terms of how good the chicken is cooked. Sometimes absolutely delicious and other times a little dry. A friend suggested I ask for hummus inside the pita (strange I know) but that really does the trick in terms of having a \"good\" pita there and if only they could improve their service speed so you don't have to wait 20 minutes each time they would get a 4. I almost gave them 4 this time around because a manager approached us as we were having dinner and of course noticed that we had to get up twice to ask if our order was almost ready. She was nice enough to comp our meal and gave us a gift card, but I don't want that kind act to compromise my review of Zoe's. So 3 stars it is.",

But that's it, it's just a concept. The food is as sterile as the environment. The only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture... each item has the same bland taste. And as I am somewhat of a foodie, the thing that is most amazing is that I know you have to work to make food this blah. The ingredients seem fresh, they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good, but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released, removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth.  I suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed, but IMHO save your money and take yourself anywhere else.  :)",

I had the steak roll-ups entree and the rolls were delish! There was tons of flavor in the meat and veggies, the dip was great, and I loved the pasta salad side. My daughter had the chicken roll-ups kids meal and loved it. She tried one of my rolls as well and loved the steak roll-up dip...and ended up taking the rest of the cup of dip home because she loved it so much.   I will say the portions were satisfying for us, being smaller girls, but I can imagine that any male I know or someone with a big appetite might be disappointed in just getting one entree so the price point might be high if someone has to compensate for the small portions with extra sides or dishes.   We will definitely be back and I want to try the hummus next time along with some other dishes that looked tasty.",

The interior was cute to match and even had local artists' works propped up on ledges which was nice to see the local support. I couldn't figure out if this was a chain or locally owned because it looked borderline corportate inside but had a lot of \"we support local\" types about.   As a first-timer I asked the counter girl her suggestion and she (and the woman behind her) were kind enough to offer up good suggestions. I order Zoe's Club Pita with pasta salad for $8. I walked away but doubled back to ask if it had come with a drink, the counter girl said no but gave me a drink anyway... uh, hello, so nice!  I'm glad I took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was AMAZING! A generous portion of feta cheese and tomatoes was delightful, my only complant was there wasn't enough. I wanted more!  My sandwhich on the other hand was a different story. The pita pocket had huge hole in it making it tear and really difficult to handle. The meat wasn't positioned all the way into the pocket and most of it was falling out the top. It was like three slices of ham had been wrapped around huge slices of grilled chicken and shoved into the pita. I was pretty sad to see this. I ate the whole thing and although it was tasty, it wasn't easy to keep altogether.  I really appreciated the counter girl's kindness in giving me a drink but the status of the sandwhich was enough to probably deter me from returning. Which is too bad because I love that they support local so much. Maybe I should have had a salad.",

    "text": "I forgot how much I liked Zoe's.  I used to come here all the time but just stopped for some reason.... now I'll put it back on to the \"usual\" list for sure.  The \"Gruben\" grilled turkey sandwich on rye is super delicious, and I can't get enough of the feta coleslaw, though the pasta salad w/ basil is really tasty too.  I noticed they've added braised white beans as a side option which is intriguing; can't wait to try them!  The service is always ridiculously fast; which is a plus for a 'fast/casual' type place.   The chocolate sheet cake is super yummy and reminds me of the cakes my grandma used to make.  You always get bonus points for reminding me of my grandmother. :)",

She recommended having the sauce that I was uncertain about on the side and offered to get another side if we did not like the rosemary white beans. We liked the beans and the sauce! The food was fast and good. Place not fancy but nice.",

This location seem to have lots of seating. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Overall it seemed quite clean also. parking seemed to be a bit limited. I would definitely recommend this place and I plan to be back!",

Today I had the Chicken pita pizza - amazeballs!  Also, the marinated slaw is to die for - huge chunks of feta cheese.  The service is always fast and friendly, and the food is always fresh.  It's a great lunch spot, if you can find a parking spot ;-)",

    "text": "I recently had Zoe's cater a bridal luncheon I was hosting. They were extremely kind and helpful while I was placing my order via phone, and helped to ensure that I ordered the right amount of food for the 30 people I was hosting. They had the food ready at 10am on a Sunday, an hour before they opened. I appreciated that they accommodated the order pick up time even though it was before they were officially open. The food was fantastic. We had the kabobs, with rice pilaf and pasta salad. Everything was absolutely delicious and all of my guests loved it. I would highly recommend Zoe's for eat-in, take-out and especially if you need a great catered lunch or dinner for a large group!",

We got excited as soon as we walked in the door. You could smell the freshness!  We had a hard time deciding, but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben. Both were fabulous, and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well. We so wish we had a place like this at home!",
