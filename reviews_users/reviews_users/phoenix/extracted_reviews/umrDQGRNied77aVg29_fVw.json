I think he's convinced there is chicken in the donuts but whatever, who am I to ruin his dream of Santa, Hogwarts or Chicken donuts.  Not me.  I grabbed a breakfast Sammie this week and bought a shirt. The crew is happy, friendly and don't make you feel bad for not reading the menu completely. I'd have loved to try the ramen but it's only available on the weekends.  If you get lunch make sure to grab a pack of donuts with assorted flavors to spread the word of this awesome gem and because you should be a good person to those around you. But donuts, get more friends.",

The thing is, flavor profiles are such an incredible thing to those of us who want to thoroughly enjoy the food we eat.   I love that no matter when I walk in, my options are not limited and there is a constant funnel of new flavor combinations to try as far as the donut selection is concerned.  This morning I went in after a quick run up A mountain in Tempe. If you've walked that incline you know exactly why I stopped in for food after. My go to was the South by Southwest, the jalapeno relish really never disappoints. But I also went ahead with the side of potatoes this time around. My favorite thing about this place has got to be that portion control. I left feeling full and happy but not overly done. The staff is always polite and prompt and never too in your face, which is a lovely balance before your coffee.  The only thing that could make me happier is the day they throw up a glazed yeast donut with char marks from the grill....honestly. I always leave satisfied. If you haven't yet, check this off your places to visit next.",

We split the Champurrado Pilloncillo, Tamarindo fritter AND a Membrillo Jamoncillo Pinones donut.  Verdict?  Thumbs up on the cake consistency of the Membrillo and the crispy warm fritter with subtle tamarindo sauce.  Wasn't really feeling the Champurrado...would have loved a twist with cilantro.  But still happy with my first visit.  Wayne is incredibly friendly and stopped by our table to check in.  Already planning a future visit to try the ramen and other savory offerings.",

I asked worker to explain why my cake donut was \"super premium\" and he said donuts that are part of combo are kept in kitchen, not cake donut in case. I was over charged for $2 cake donut.

Be cautious of the raw chicken they're serving! And don't send it back because the guy behind the counter is ready with his 5min schpill  On how it's \"absolutely normal\" to see blood & raw chicken in their chicken breasts. (Yea ok guy that's reassuring)   We had pre-ordered 2 dozen chicken wings for the super bowl too but had to cancel. So glad we did! I would've had a hard time trying to convince my party that it was \"normal\" and that raw chicken is ok to eat. (Right) Good luck with that.   Oh and don't bring in outside coffee from your favorite coffee shop either. The same guy that tried to convince me that the raw chicken was fine to eat, kicked us out for bringing in our own coffee but of course not until we had already spent $45+ there. This was @ 10:30 am still very cold outside for our two toddlers and four month old.   A warning would've been nice, a simple hey guys next time please don't bring in outside drinks.  or idk maybe placing a sign on the door simply stating no outside food or drinks would have saved us the hassle.    Worst experience ever!   Thanks for the stomach ache! (Not)",

Tried a few different kinds. Seemed expensive to me for a donut. I was not too impressed either. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but the donut to value ratio seems off to me. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product. This didn't feel like one of those deals. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but the food just was off. I will try again another time and update If this was a one time kind of experience.",

The donuts are amazing and there are some vegan options too. Their purveyors seem to be mostly locally sourced and the cold brew was one of the smoothest I have had. The atmosphere is that of a small diner and very friendly. The only drawback for me was the lack of all gender restrooms. Binary bathrooms are challenging to navigate for me when traveling and not knowing each state's set of laws around bathroom use, so I would have appreciated if the single stalls had been all genders.",

I talked to the cashier, the cook, and even the manager for vegan substitutes for the donut sandwich and I was told there is nothing. I asked for vegan ramen and although they had the broth wouldn't give it to me because they were out of jackfruit. This morning all I asked for was relish as a side for the cake donut and they refused to accommodate that too. They said we can't just give you relish because we have to save it for the people ordering a chicken sandwich. They made excuses about not knowing how to accommodate someone who was vegetarian which is ridiculous this day in age in Phoenix- please don't write your vegetarian friendly when you're not! You guys made me feel pretty bad today- shame on you!",

    "text": "Fine Donuts in Phoenix   This weekend adventure brought me to the desert land of Phoenix. Wanting to try the best Arizona has to offer, I happen to come across Welcome Chicken + Donuts.   Raspberry (cake) Strawberry Balsamic (raised) Chipotle Limon (cake) Chocolate Pistachio Rose (raised) Irish Car Bomb (filled) Matcha Green Tea w/ Blood Orange (cake)   Because of my experience with \"hipster\" donut places, I wasn't expecting much out of this place. The first donut I tried was the Raspberry. The frosting is full of raspberry flavor with a very luscious cake texture on the bottom. The Strawberry Balsamic was probably my favorite one out of the box. The strawberry flavor was punching my taste buds with extreme flavor and the slight hint of balsamic seemed to magnify the taste even more. The dough was also very soft. The Chipotle Limon was another great cake donut but I wasn't too big of a fan of the sharp and zesty flavor. The last one I tried, Chocolate Pistachio Rose, was another great donut that has a light chocolate flavor.   I didn't get to try both the Irish Car Bomb and Matcha Green Tea w/ Blood Orange but according to my friends, they really seemed to enjoy each and every bite.   This place definitely surprised me with the quality of the donuts. I'm usually not a fan of exotic flavored, Instagrammable donuts but the flavor was amazing and the dough was worthy. I would love to try all of the other flavors they have if I ever return to the desert.   The Fried Chicken isn't served until 10:30am. I came at 9:30am :'(",

Now they close whenever they sell out of stuff, so we decided to give them a call first and they said they were out of wings. Oh well, I can deal with that.  Got there and the ordered two piece drumsticks combo and my boyfriend got the leg and thigh combo.. Mine Korean bbq and his Japanese bbq.  Got the miso butter corn side with plain cake donut.   The chicken was amazing! I had all the dark meat which I love, and it was SO juicy every bite I took. The taste was amazing too. I tried both flavors but I think I liked the Korean bbq more.   The donut was AMAZING. I like donuts, but I love this donut. It was warm when I ate it, and I so wish I could have one every day.  The side was ehh... None of the sides appealed to me. Wish I can just have another donut.   The service was good, place was clean, and I seriously loved the food. But I would say the portion is too small for what we're paying!! I guess because it's just so good:/.  Urgh. But my boyfriend said if they were closer he'd go every day. That's a big compliment right there.  P. S. Can't you be open for longer each day? Make more chicken and donuts so I can go more often!! Got such a short time span to get your yummy food. :(",

We ordered the thigh and leg combo with the Korean sauce and Japanese bbq sauce.   Donuts: We legit ordered $20 worth of donuts, just to be a tad disappointed. It could be because we arrived at 3:30 when they close at 4....so I'll hold my reviews on the donuts til I try them early in the morning. They look phenomenal though!   Ramen was tasty, had a savory pork flavor and came with lots of items in the bowl i.e. corn, kim chi, charsiu pork pieces, scallions and soft boiled eggs. The taste was only mediocre for being $14/bowl though.   We loved the novelty of the place and will be back for the bomba$$ chicken!!",

The selection of donuts is unique enough that you want to try a little bit of everything which I recommend but it's going to set you back a few bucks if you get a dozen and you're going to take most of them home because you'll be lucky to get through 2 of them if you ordered anything else. The flavors they have are pretty great and everything I tried was excellent.   The fried chicken though, that's the real deal. After tasting it I wanted to toss the donuts and get a bucket of it to go. It has a wonderful flavor and is juicy, crispy and perfect. I only tried the breast so I can't speak of any of the dark meat.   The people working the counter are extremely friendly, helpful and patient. They even fixed my order without complaint after I screwed up what I ordered. Definitely check this place out and bring your appetite.",

There used to be this commercial for dunkin donuts where the employee had to get up real early and he was like \"time to make the donuts\" all sleepy like. If a boring corporate place like DD could be bothered to wake up early, I would think these guys who are supposedly passionate about donuts would be willing to too.   The reason I am bringing this up was I was going to bring a dozen donuts to work. Was hoping that my co workers would be all \"he is so cool he thinks out of the box with these crazy bacon donuts!\" But I couldn't buy that dozen because our meeting starts at 8.

    "text": "I've been waiting a while to try this place out, after reading about it on Yelp as well as the Phoenix New Times. Although the fried chicken as actually quite alright, along with the side sauce (I had the Vietnamese-style dipping sauce with fish sauce, garlic, and cilantro), the cucumber salad, as well as the cake donut that came with it, it wasn't as great as it was hyped-up to be. Don't get me wrong here; the food was good, the chicken was delicious and juicy, and the service was excellent and friendly, but I thought $9 for a 2-piece combo, with a small side and a dipping sauce was too pricey. Now I understand that they high overhead costs (especially near Downtown Phoenix) and I'm all about supporting small businesses, but I really thought that they could at least add a little more something to a plate like this. Say, maybe an extra wing, some french fries, maybe even a medium drink or something; that would then be worth $9. I also saw that the ramen soup, which I had considered before choosing the chicken combo, was like $14. That's an expensive bowl of ramen; even when I lived in Vienna, Austria, I don't remember paying more than 12 for a big bowl of Vietnamese pho there, and that's one of the most expensive cities to live and work in. In sum, would I come here again? Sure; as I mentioned, I support small independent businesses, and I want them to succeed. Would I ever order the ramen in the future? Maybe, just once, to try it out and see if it's as good as many say it is. Would I go out of my way to visit again? Probably not, unless I was in the area and was craving a certain item or some donuts. In any case, it's still a good place to check out.",

GREAT SERVICE! The guys there are really down to earth. They give you an honest view of things you might want to try. They never rush you are always open for any questions you may have.  The food is SOOO GOOOD!! All the chicken flavors are great! My favorite is the Japanesse BBQ! The best thing also is that you can get the sauce on the side as well if you want to just dip. All four sides offered work with any meal. Cant say one is better than the other because they are so good!  The DOUNUTS!! MANNN the dounuts are a must. The best dount I say would be the MAPLE AND BACON one. But the others are great as well. Get there early because all of phoenix will be there eating all the dounts you missed on because you didnt get there in time.  Overall the price is great. For 11 bucks I got a three pieace meal with a side and a dounut. Cant beat that!  A MUST PLACE TO GO!!!",

    "text": "I like risk. I like drinking iced toddy. I also like fried chicken.  Tomorrow the delightfully scrappy team that brought their delicious vision of what a local diner could be when the food was made the superstar, opens their doors for the first day of business... and what will they be featuring? Asian-glazed fried chicken, in-house created donuts, some misc veggie side dishes... and cold-brewed coffee that, in my opinion, is good enough to stand alone and make me get in my car. Often.   The risky part, however, is two-fold:  Will the former KFC building on the SW corner of 16th St. and Buckeye turn donuts into dough? Well, the Meat Shop has yet to meet its maker. The Duce has yet to take a deuce. Lolo's cried, \"YOLO,\" and promptly upgraded its school clothes. So, maybe it's all good in the hood... the neighborhood that I love, that is.  The other risk, besides location... location... location... is whether or not the trio of Asian chicken glazes will be embraced. As southern food goes, this is definitely from the south... well, South Korea. Currently 3 sauce options are available: a savory Korean, a fragrant Vietnamese and a tangy Japanese BBQ. During Day #2 of their soft-opening, we tried all 3 flavors.  So, first things first. As smart as it would've been to grab a To-Go menu, I didn't; and although my mind is like a viscous steel trap, sometimes that steel is more like a warm Gummi Bear and really doesn't retain shit, and therefore, caveat reador (basically, don't vandalize my bike if I get small detail wrong).  There were options for a 2-Piece, a 3-Piece, only chicken breasts and finally, the \"whole chicken.\" A 6-pack and 12-pack of wings are available as well. Each combo includes a small, asian-ish side dish (corn, sliced cucumbers or slaw) and your choice of house-made donut. There were 5 of us and we all ordered 2-Piece combos, and lamely all got the same Korean sauce. All sauces are available on the side, but they recommended having them tossed... and that was a delicious decision. I also ordered a half dozen wings with the Vietnamese glaze. Eventually, I returned for 2nds and brought back 2 chicken breasts, glazed in the Japanese BBQ.   The 2-Piece Combos are a drumstick & a thigh. The 3-Piece steps you up to a breast. I love the flavor of dark meat, so I was particularly happy with my duo. The batter had a gentle, buttery crunch, savory flavor and was right up my alley. To me, it wasn't spicy, but extremely flavorful and satisfying, with notes of sweet, garlic, sesame and soy. The chicken was juicy and tasty as if it were brined. Was it? I don't know. The wings are actual wings... and not the sports bar blend with \"drumettes.\" Also, they're the whole wing... right down to the tip, so expect that \"L\" shape if you order them. The Vietnamese glaze was very fragrant and though it pho'k up my friend's pallet due to the fish flavor, his lady-friend said it was her fave. It reminded me of Nuoc Cham, the traditional sweet dipping sauce made from sugar, vinegar, fish sauce, garlic and Thai chili (your recipe may vary!). Finally, the Japanese BBQ was Mr. Anti-Fish's top choice. I liked it but also felt it was the least expressive... especially next to the other two statement-makers.   I tried the apple fritter with bits of baked cheddar. We also shared a cream cheese w/blueberry and a couple of the key lime donuts. I think what seemed like a banana's foster donut also showed up. Although everyone had their personal fave, overall, I'd rate these donuts far and above the average 'nut. Flaky. Delicate. Flavor-layered. Creative. Risky. Bad-ass. Boom!   Finally, the cold-brewed iced coffee was SICK. LOVED it. Big and rich... balanced and truly tasty. It reminded me of my first toddy years ago at Sagasta's place, Jobot. They also have real cream. Viscous and oozy... the anti-soy of milks!  Only request?  - Larger pieces of chicken. The drum was a small drumstick and the thigh was just larger than a kiwi.  In summary, the chicken was delicious and the donuts were... fantastic.   For an $8-13 price range, as long as locals will get their asses down to 16th & Buckeye, I think this place is gonna work out great! Go try it!",

The ramen dishes sounded unappealing to me as well. BUT..... The doughnuts looked amazing, so I purchased half a dozen. I must admit I am not crazy about bacon but I loved the maple bacon doughnut. It was like having breakfast! The doughnut was so damn fresh and fluffy light. Delicious! I also enjoyed the raspberry goat cheese doughnut, more like a cake doughnut but just the same, delicious. My husband liked the chocolate cover glazed and I also found that the glazed doughnut was so good. The staff is so friendly and cute. Place is clean, you may sit inside or outside.  It's a good thing I live in Peoria because I would be hitting this place a lot!",

Each donut hits the mark and is by no means disappointing. This is the main reason I awarded any stars.  Their chicken is a different story though. I had the spicy Korean sauce on my chicken. It was beyond salty. I like salty food but this was too much even for me. My friend had their sauce on the side and I discovered by trying their chicken without the sauce is still just too salty. Adding the sauce made it even more salty. This was also True for the side dish I chose as well. The corn I had was beyond salty as well. It was a disappointing experience for lunch. However, donuts may be  a possibility in the morning.",

    "text": "From the people that brought you the lovely welcome diner that sits down Roosevelt row. Now bring you a delightful but yet intriguing place to eat out at! Who knew the love of fried chicken and a box of donuts will make \"chicken + donuts\" I love, love, LOVE the concept of everything that this has become. Literally fell in love with the inside and the back patio dining area. Menu is simple yet different there's a chicken and donut combo menu which you get your choices of chicken pieces and then the donut that compliments the chicken flavor choice of sauce which is 3, I personally loved the Korean bbq sauce! You also have a choice of side, I got the corn miso stir fry which is really good! And the donut was awesome, and so fresh you definitely can taste the passion! They didn't have a lot of drink choices? Or maybe I wasn't looking but you can't go wrong with water, am I right? Also the menu includes a ramen menu which a lot of people I observed order, have not tried but will update you cause I do love me a bowl of hot noodles! And also a sandwich menu, lunch and breakfast included! And of course their specialty donuts on display I recommend coming early I guess? Because I went at noon? And only a few were left out! But I'm pretty sure you can of course order a dozen a day before or put in an order! But other than that staff was super helpful and friendly! Loved their energy and the inside is so delightful with cute artwork on the wall! So stop by, and keep that local love going! Definitely a spot to return too!",

    "text": "I won't lie it is the name that peeked my interest. I like both Chicken and Donuts but never imagined having both of them at the same time. Well, that is what is served here and more. However, the highlight is the Chicken and Donuts.   Welcome serves all natural, never frozen, no hormone, no antibiotic, humanely raised, bone-in chicken. This chicken is golden crispy seasoned with salt/pepper to perfection. I am a breast and wing person which they have conquered satisfying my taste buds. Yes, this chicken is finger licking. You have to option to have it smothered in sauce or on the side. I have ordered my sauce on the side however the chicken is so darn good I don't take the time to dip it in the sauce. I have tried the Korean Chili and the Japanese BBQ. They both have a great flavor.   Now the donuts... I do not know where to begin. To be fair I do not like fancy donuts. I am more of a plain cake donut but my first experience was the sprinkled cake donut. I am officially hooked. I felt like a five year old again. I ate the whole thing and wanted like two more. It was sooooooo good. Now once I am hooked I am hooked so every time I returned I always seem to get the same donut. To challenge myself I added an extra donut to my order and got the plain glazed donut. Let's put it this way I will NEVER buy another plain glazed donut from the grocery store. That glazed donut is the BOMB. It melts right into your mouth. I have purchased other donuts from here for the office and friends who all have enjoyed their tasty treats.   The only side I have tried is the Cumber Salad. Because it is so good I have yet to venture off and try a different one. lol!  Now if you lucky you will get a seat inside. Otherwise there is seating outside. You can also order to go. The service is fast and friendly.",

Shared the vegan ramen, a breast and leg combo with the Korean chili sauce, a side of their Thai yum slaw, and a raspberry glazed donut filled with a lightly sweeten cream/custard and topped with candy coated pistachios all with my boyfriend. Plenty of food for two.  Service was GREAT! Super friendly and welcoming staff. Very clean, cozy and bright interior.  Definitely would recommend to all!",

    "text": "I have had this place bookmarked for well over a year.  Always in a hurry getting in and out of Phoenix and just haven't found the time to give it a go.  Well, today I picked up my Silvercar and low and behold it's practically in the same parking lot!  Fate had spoken as I hadn't had anything to eat and here it was right in front of my face.  First off, the fried chicken is great.  Nicely spiced.  A little greasy but hey, it's fried chicken right?  The sauce I had been eyeing, and one of their most popular, is the Korean chili sauce.  They typically serve the chicken smothered in the sauce, which I did.  It was good but as I looked around all the regulars got it on the side.  I will do that next time and use it as dipping sauce.  It was still good mind you, just really messy.  The side I chose was the cucumber salad.  Nice way to cut the heat of the sauce but wasn't anything I would gush over.  Next time I want to try the Thai salad side or the stir fry.  Lastly, THE DOUGHNUTS!!!!!   I got a half dozen assorted to share with my friends and we devoured them.  While the maple bacon was of course wonderful, the standouts for me were the apricot buttermilk and the chipotle limon.  The flavor of these with their sweetness mixed with the savory fried chicken and Korean chili were the best bites to be had hands down.  While perhaps not the healthiest of brunches to be had it was certainly tasty and definitely worth another visit.",

We had the thigh/drumstick combo (1 Korean and 1 Vietnamese sauce - $9) this time around. You know how you often pull the skin off fried chicken and toss it since it's too greasy/mushy/thick? Well, plan on wishing you had more on this chicken. Between the light and crispy season skin and extra delicious sauce, this chicken is a cut above. For donuts we chose the Orange Banana bread pudding and the Pear Peach Apple Butter.  A-freaking-maxing.  I also had to try the fried shiitake mushrooms ($6). The batter was really good again and the mushrooms wet very tasty,  but maybe fried too long as they were s bit chewy.  The staff at WC&D are all extremely friendly and helpful.",

Maybe the jet lag and heat was a contributing factor, but it blew our minds.   For breakfast, my friend had two donuts with funky jelly filled flavor combos that we had never seen before and I had the breakfast sandwich (hot cake donut, bacon, egg, and jalapeno jam). It was so damn good, we decided that we absolutely had to stop by for lunch at the end of our trip on our way back to the airport so we could try the fried chicken with sauce on the side (it did not disappoint. My only regret now is that I did not get two pieces... *drool*). I loved it all so much that I also decided to get a to go box of fun flavored donuts to carry home on the flight for my other friends to do a 'donut tasting' (which was demolished in minutes, of course). I repeat... I carried a box of donuts through two airports y'all -- it took tremendous effort and willpower not to eat them all before sharing with friends back home.   Anyway, we salute you, Chicken + Donuts, for doin' it riiiiiight!   PS. Can you deliver to San Francisco, please?!",

We stopped in for breakfast yesterday and were glad to experience the hype we had heard so much about. This place knocked it out of the park, and we didn't even get to try the chicken yet (which looked amazing getting prepped in the kitchen behind the front counter).   We had a Chocolate, Rose and Pistachio donut, a Rainbow Sprinkles donut, and a D. E. C. (Cake donut, Egg and Cheese, plus we added bacon because why wouldn't you?) Yes, I just described a donut breakfast sandwich; don't knock it until you try it. Both traditional donuts were excellent and made with quality ingredients. The breakfast donut sandwich was an amazing mix of freshly cracked egg, thick cut bacon, cheddar, and a slightly sweet donut that was warm and crumbled apart in your mouth. Absolutely delicious and recommended for anyone adventurous looking for a surprise combination of great flavors.   Can't wait to come back and try the chicken and ramen noodles next time! Not to mention more donuts!!!",

It's slightly sweet and lemony with a bite on the exterior and a soft mellow center.   We get Vietnamese sauce on the side and Thai slaw. But it's all really about the chicken and donuts!! And those donuts- delectable! The yeast version has a glorious texture and amazing flavors. Not too sweet. Different choice each time we've been.   Hint - if you are getting two combos you might as well get the whole combo and an extra doughnut. You won't regret the extra chicken for just a few dollars more!",

Where else might you find a restaurant with that type of variety... I'll wait...   Buhler?    Don't go here thinking you'll have Southern Fried chicken that is usually heavier flour and more seasoned.  This chicken is Korean Fried, which means it is \"twice fried\" with a very light batter that is almost tempura-like, but not quiet.  The chicken is served with (or tossed in) Asian inspired sauces.  I ordered a 2 piece chicken with the Korean Chili.  Since I got the combo, I could have a salad and donut with it.  I opted for a Sprinkle donut.  I also had a the very good cucumber salad.

    "text": "Believe the hype! Lucky for me, I only judge food AFTER I've tried it. Been reading and hearing about this place...with their anomaly combo of fried chicken with a donut. What the...?  But I love food so here we are.  I went with the consensus and ordered the most popular menu item. Thigh and drum combo, Thai Yum slaw and sauce on the side. I'll start with the sauce. I tried both the Japanese BBQ and Korean Chili. Hands down- the Japanese BBQ won for its flavor alone. The Korean Chili is a bit spicy yet tart and lacking flavor, leaves a strange aftertaste in the mouth. The Thai slaw- not the taste I was expecting but actually quite refreshing. I tasted mint in there. Normally not a mint fan but it works. Tasty! I'd eat it again. The cake donut- ok. So I'm a sauce & condiment kind of person. I like my donuts frosted, fries with ketchup, chicken strips with 4 different sauces, etc.! BUT again I wanted to try this as everyone before me so thoughtfully recommended. So I ordered and ate the plain cake donut with the chicken. Heavenly. I will never judge a plain donut again, unless it doesn't taste like this one did. Simply delicious. Soft, fluffy on the inside, perfect golden crust on the outside. Alas, we mustn't forget the chicken! Everything I wasn't expecting and better. Getting it unsauced is the way to go. Alone, it's crispy, flavorful and so juicy! I think if you ordered with sauce, it wouldn't be as crispy and that'd be a shame. If I had 10 pieces in front of me, I would've eaten all of them with no regret. Dipped into the Japanese BBQ, I've now entered to a new dimension. This place isn't close to me house but you can bet your big booty that I'll be back!   P.S.- so because I'm a glutton, I ordered a maple bacon donut for the drive home. Hot damn, kid!!! That is one delicious donut! So fluffy soft inside and that frosting is to die for. Its huge and can be shared. Unless you're slothy like me.",

I ordered the thigh & drumstick combo [$9] - comes with one sauce (either on the side or tossed with your chicken), a side, and a regular donut. I asked if I could get two sauces, and the cashier said I could, but I wish he told me it would cost $1 extra. Also, since I ordered a premium donut (Lemon Basil, white choc. donut), I had to pay $0.70 more. So the total with tax was abt $12.70.   We sat outside, and since it had just rained the other day, the wind felt so nice. But yes, shooing away the pigeons was a tad annoying.  Our meals arrived about ~30min after we ordered. The sauces were more tangy than what I would have expected as well (aka they weren't that good). The chicken was lightly battered and crispy though and so moist! The donut was really delicious :0 there was a hint of basil flavor that wasn't overpowering. My friend got a chocolate, pistachio with rose flavored donut that was pretty good too.   -1 star for slightly pricey foods (for the amount you get) and sauces that aren't that great +4 stars for super moist chicken, their own parking lot, outdoor covered seating, unique donut flavors",

    "text": "Tips:  Chicken is not served until 10:30am  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The fried chicken here is super tasty and the flavors are very True to the flavors that they are trying to go achieve. The Korean flavor is a tiny bit spicy and has that great gochujang (red pepper paste) taste. The Japanese BBQ flavor is very reminiscent of a tonkatsu sauce taste. Overall the fried chicken flavors are QUITE salty, so definitely drink a lot of water or balance it out with some donuts. (They definitely made the best business decision by pairing chicken with donuts)  Peanut butter salted caramel donut - LOVE! Highly recommend for peanut butter lovers. It is a cake donut with a salted caramel peanut butter icing on top. It tastes like you're just eating peanut butter on top of a donut, super yummy.  Irish Car Bomb donut - A gigantic donut filled with a bailey's type of cream filling on the inside. Donut is light and airy, cream has got the flavors you love from an Irish car bomb drink.  Overall, great place with great food.",

    "text": "Location: I think this restaurant just opened up not too long ago and it used to be a church. It is located at a busy business district. The place is a bit small with total of 6 tables max inside the place. If you have a big party, get ready to sit outdoor. It isn't very well decorated and a bit old. However, I am there for the food and the place is relatively clean.   Service: this is not a sit in restaurant with your own server. Therefore, I can only rate the service of staffs who work over the counter.They are very smiley and friendly. If you are obviously a first timer, they definitely take the time to explain each flavor they have to offer. It takes between 5-10 minutes for your order to be ready. Weather you are dining in or taking it to go, it is super convenient.    Food: We wanted to order chicken wings and unfortunately it was all sold out by 12pm. I ended up ordering 2 pieces of chicken combo with Korean chilli favor and cucumber as a side. When my food finally arrived, it came in a small neat looking box and a donut. Oh man! The chicken falls off the bones and the chicken skin is sooooo flavorable. The cucumber side dish was a bit salty. I probably wouldn't recommend it. The donut is not too sweet and it just a perfect way to end the meal.   I cannot wait to go back there again to try different types of donuts and maybe a taste of their chicken wings.",

After meeting friends here for lunch, I decided I had to bring my kid in for a donut. We stopped in and to my horror were met with a completely empty case. The counter person saw the look on her face and handed her a donut he'd fried from the last bit of batter left in the kitchen. He said it was going to be his after-work snack, but he'd rather she had it, and he refused to charge us. She was thrilled, declared it the best donut she'd ever tasted, and asked if we could bring these donuts instead of cupcakes to school for her upcoming birthday. I guess these guys have earned themselves a lifelong fan.",

Everyone was really helpful and even let me try the Korean Chili sauce, which I was not a fan of.  Fried chicken breast- incredible, best fried chicken I have ever had.  Japanese BBQ sauce- I am glad I got it on the side so I could dip the chicken and it was amazing! Will get it again for sure.  Thai yum slaw- wasn't a fan, it was very miso salad dressing tasting, I probably should have asked for an explanation on it. I would have thought it would have peanuts or some sort of peanut sauce thing.  Thai tea Arnold Palmer- was a good donut but was not a huge fan of the sauce.   I am definitely coming back for some chicken and Japanese BBQ sauce and hopefully they will have the maple bacon donut in stock for me to try.",

The bacon had a nice smoke flavor and when eaten as a whole with the glaze and dough it was an awesome salty/sweet flavor explosion.    The red wine and chocolate was just OK for me.  You can definitely taste the red wine and the chocolate pudding was nice on its own, but together?  Eh, not so much for me.  The apple fritter was pretty tasty.  Lots of flavor, great size with a lot of apples and a good dough.  Overall, looking forward to going again to try new flavors and most likely more maple bacon doughnuts!",

    "text": "Finally made a pit stop here. Chicken and donuts, who would've thunk lol. Donuts are definitely creative. I had a chicken fried combo- 1 leg, 1 breast, 1 wing, (the meal comes with a donut, has to be a standard donut though, there's an upcharge for a premium donut). The chicken was decent, nothing out of this world, in fact, it was a little too crunchy for me. I'd definitely give 3 stars for just the chicken. I got a side of Korean Chile, it was way too salty so instead I just added hot sauce. I ordered with a side of cucumber salad and it was pretty bland. Side servings are VERY small.  I tried several donuts, Pear Plum Yogurt Donut, Apple Fritter, Pistachio Chocolate and a Boston Creme type donut. My favorite was the Boston Creme, the cream didn't taste generic at all. The Pear Plum donut was very moist and dense. The Fritter was nothing special, kind of dry actually and the Pistachio one was also quite dry.  I'll definitely go back for more donuts and for their chicken sandwiches, which apparently are so much better than just their chicken.  Chicken isn't served until after 10:30am. I noticed most sides are small so order more than 1 side if you're extra hungry, (or in my opinion just hungry, that's how small they seemed to me). Although the lines can get long, they move really quickly so don't fret if you see it coming out onto the side. Food also comes out quickly. Pretty limited seating inside but plenty outside.",

They were tasty!  The sauce had great flavor and it smelled amazing.  The chicken was not grisly, as some small drumsticks are... and the chicken fell off the bone pretty easily.    They had a pretty cool variety of donuts.  I tried the Chocolate+Almond+Coconut, Lemon Poppyseed, and Classic Apple Fritter.  All were good, but not exceptional and a little pricy.  My friend got the PB+Blackberry Liqueur.  It was probably the least favorite out of all of the ones we tried.    All in all, I will be back for some good chicken! Who am I kidding?

    "text": "The doughnuts themselves were good. Not amazing, but good. The thing is, they are really expensive. $1.75 for the basic ones and $3.50 for the fancy ones. It cost us $20 for a half dozen doughnuts and 2 coffee's. Sorry, but I've been elsewhere both in town and out that have way better doughnuts for a third of the price. It doesn't matter how \"cool\" you think you are, at the heart of any amazing establishment is the product you offer to people and how you offer it. No one can ever do good by just selling a gimmick, if you have a gimmick that's fine but you've got to have a solid product at a competitive price to go along with it.   We didn't get the chicken, so can't comment on it. The Ramen they had looked really good, but it's like $12~$14 per serving, so not sure if I'll ever buy it there since I can get amazing, authentic Ramen elsewhere in town for under $10.",

    "text": "Best fried chicken in Phoenix. There, I said it. Ignore the one-star reviews about the \"raw\" chicken. Your chicken will be piping hot when it comes out and yes, sometimes blood and juices will continue to seep from the bone, but your chicken will be safe.  Compared to other Korean fried chicken places (Kyochon, Bon Chon, etc.) the quality of the chicken is comparable or better. The sauces are a little saltier but I'll forgive them for that based on other positives. All the sides are solid.  The doughnuts are also great. Personal fave is the pumpkin espuma, it's magical. I love maple bacon doughnuts but I'll be honest, Voodoo Doughnuts' in Portland is better. Locally, Rollover has the better maple bacon.  Cold press coffee here is also great. I love this place.",

    "text": "I woke up with a mean craving for chicken and waffles and no motivation to get in the kitchen whip some up. I hopped on yelp and tried the hot and new option, this was the first place that popped up. Granted it's not \"chicken and waffles\", but it was close enough for my craving. I knew as soon as I pulled up that I made the right decision. The aroma of fried chicken and fresh donuts oozing out of the place makes your mouth water before you even open your car doors. I got a half dozen premium donuts and a 12 wing order.  Pros:  -Everything was fresh, the donuts had just been made, I saw them bring out the chicken from the walk in and start frying it up. This isn't stuff that sits under a heating lamp. -Offers both indoor and outdoor seating -They offer flavored seasoning sauces for the fried chicken. -Awesome service and friendly employees  Cons: -I wanted to try two different sauces with my 12 wing order and the charged me for two 6 wing orders rather than one 12 wing order because it was an inconvenience for them. -The price is a little ridiculous. For 6 premium donuts and 12 wings I paid $26.  -The service is slower than I like. Not bad. Just a little slow.  With that being said, I'll definitely be going back for some more grub and recommending it to friends",

    "text": "Chicken and donuts - two of America's favorite things. Add those to the team behind Welcome Diner and you've got an awesome new place!  Visited on a Saturday a little before 11AM. There was a line but we didn't wait too long. My boyfriend and I both got the two-piece combo. I chose the Japanese BBQ and the chocolate donut and he went Korean with a maple bacon donut.   (Okay. I know what you're thinking - isn't this a fried chicken place? What's with the Asian sauces? Asian chicken with donuts? What's going on?? Yes, it's a weird combo. But trust me, somehow it works and it's freaking fantastic so just go with it.)  The Japanese BBQ was out of this world. So delicious. It was tangy and flavorful, definitely more of a Japanese flair than BBQ. The Korean sauce was good but a little too spicy for me. So if you're a fan of mild, go Japanese. The pieces are smaller than what you get at a KFC or another place like that. It actually reminded me that chickens aren't supposed to be that big so I was okay with the smaller pieces.  I got the miso corn as my side. It was good but a few too many peppers for my taste. If it was just the corn I'd have gobbled it up.  Okay, on to the donuts. I hate to say it but they were just okay. I really wanted to like them and after the amazing chicken expected big things. I didn't like the maple bacon donut at all (weird, right?!) The bacon part was good but the donut was a little too chewy and left an odd aftertaste. The chocolate cake donut was better but was a little grainy. I have to say that my boyfriend went back the next week and got the regular donut and said it was very good. So save the upgrade and go regular donut I guess!  So despite the so-so donut I'm still giving this place 5 stars just for the chicken. As we were driving away I already wanted more. Needless to say, I will be back!",

As we waited in a long line to be served one of the workers was being incredibly friendly to everyone in line, calling out compliments to make everyone feel at home. \"Stay cute, everyone,\" he said, garnering chuckles from the crowd. \"We'll be with you guys soon!\" He also took the time to visit all the tables and make sure people were enjoying their food and having a nice time.   That's quality service right there.   I only got to try the apple fritter and the cake donut that came with my chicken order, but I'd absolutely return. These are their specialty. This is what they excel in.  Unfortunately, I didn't really think the chicken was all that impressive. And the packaging was a bit lacking. The gal brought out my order in a regular eat-in basket, but I reminded her that my order was to-go. Sadly, the sauce was just packed loose in a small container inside the paper box my meal came in, so by the time I went to eat it, it had all but sloshed out. The chicken itself was pretty average. Maybe it would have been better if the sauce had been put on the chicken, which is how I was expecting it to be. But instead, I got regular fried chicken and a little cup of the sauce. I guess some of it got sloshed onto my chicken due to the lack of lid on the cup, but I think that was more accident than intent.   That said, I would only remove one star for the chicken because the service and donuts were all over-the-top amazing and I would come back any time I'm visiting Phoenix.",

We saw previous reviews of this place serving raw chicken, so the first thing I did was cut into the thigh and dark red juices start gushing out and the chicken is raw. My fiance's chicken thigh was also raw. I took them back and the cook had the nerve to say that the blood is from the broken bone of the chicken. First of all... I don't see any broken bones on my chicken and I've had enough chicken I my life to know that this isn't safe to eat but he reassured me it was. They made a new batch for us and the new ones looked better than our first ones but still really pink. Their donuts weren't anything to rave over, we got the PB and the red wine and they were eh.

I had a 1 piece breast with Japanese BBQ sauce, Corn Miso Butter Stir Fry,and a Cardamom Sugar donut. Nothing short of amazing on both taste and presentation for such a low cost meal. The packaging was also simple, yet appealing to me: recycled cardboard box with a Welcome Chicken + Donut stamp. The inside looks of course like a diner and the chicken cartoon artwork on the walls was fun. Make sure to come early, the popular donuts run out and sometimes certain chicken too!",

Fried chicken was so crunchy moist and succulent that it pretty much melted in your mouth.  I was hesitant about adding the Japanese barbecue sauce but I am so glad that I did. It is a definite must in my book!  The donuts were just as equally amazing and oozing with unique creativity freshness and so much taste in each and every bite.

The best Bacon-Maple donut I've had yet. They didn't overcook the bacon and crumble it up and use as sprinkles. No, they cut the chewy fatty strip of bacon into little \"Mini me\" strips of bacon and then pile it on! And the maple icing isn't some gross maple flavor either. I'm not a fan of the maple donut at all. But this was awesome!  Now, as a donut fan, this place has some very unique flavor combo's never seen before. I held back and only ordered one donut (extreme willpower) based on the demanding day ahead of me (didn't need a carb coma) but I am so looking forward to going back to sample! And the chicken + donut combo sounds better than chicken & waffles. I'll try to update after a few more visits.",

The guy said pick any donut you want, but certain donuts will cost you a $1.50 upcharge. That upcharged donut I picked was filled with strawberry rose and had a nice powdered sugar coating on the outside. The chicken clearly stole the show with a crazy crunchy coating and great tasty meat inside (no fork needed). I think I had the Japanese BBQ sauce, but it wasn't really needed and the side dish was a corn, peppers and onion mix that was pretty standard, but good enough. Likely to return - on par with the top fried chicken in the Valley.",

To note, I shared a dozen donuts with friends, 6 premium, 6 standard donuts. I don't think the standard donuts were anything to write home about. I enjoyed about half of the premium donuts, particularly the fruity ones. So from a high level, I would say lean towards their fruity donuts and you'll be good. I'd be interested to try the chicken (which doesn't start until 10AM). They also serve a bunch of random asian things such as ramen.  I could see myself liking other flavors from this place as they rotate a lot of flavors. However, as a baseline donut dough to donut dough quality comparison, I'd say these are just standard.  tl;dr get the fruity flavors, otherwise standard donut party",

The donuts really are delicious and I believe the hot cake donut was the best of the 3 I ordered. However, my cat enjoyed the maple bacon donut best (he didn't get to try the cake donut).

    "text": "This review is based on customer service and a tone-deafness when addressing a customer's issue, not the food (which has always been stellar).  Welcome's wings are some of the best chicken wings I've ever had, crispy and well seasoned, and, up til today, a bargain. Alas, where last week you could get six WHOLE wings for six bucks, they have effectively doubled their price by disjointing the wings but maintaining the price point (a dollar for a drummer or a flat is a bit much, but does match their current price points on the rest of the menu).  Not a big issue, unless you don't let customers know what you're doing until they open their delicious boxes of chicken to find only half the amount that they thought they paid for.   And that is where this review is born: I called Welcome and was told things had changed, and when I explained that the issue was not the change but the lack of being told of the change especially since it has just happened, I was responded with a bit of a callous \"that's how it is now.\" No \"I'm sorry\", no \"our bad\", simply \"that's how it is now.\" They offered a free half dozen wings (yes, I'm no fool--I'm going to take them, but they'll be the last pieces of chicken I get from Welcome), but what I am left wanting is someone to instill proper retail relationships and even halfway decent phone etiquette. No, the customer isn't always right. But keeping the customer in the dark is never right. And the \"business as usual\" response is even worse.   Owners/managers, maybe check in on this one.",

Had the chicken sandwich....nothing on the bread, no spread, no sauce, nothing. Chicken sandwich was dry. Donuts: standard and deluxe....dry, over priced and disappointing. We ordered three different ones...and we couldn't even eat them all due to driness. I had to drink plenty of the free ice water to swallow it down. The worst $30+ spent.......wasted $$$.

I do not know what they do to this chicken but; they are doing it right. The chicken is enveloped in a perfectly crisp coating, that is seasoned to perfection. I tried the Vietnamese garlic herb sauce. It was so delicious it really could've been a beverage, LOL! The only reason why I have given this establishment four stars instead of five is I don't understand why you cannot get chicken as soon as they open.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon with some friends.  The place itself is quite tiny and from  what I know used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken so it goes to say from the outside it looks somewhat like a fast food joint.  They do have a large patio with super large benches which can definitely seat some big booties.....guess it's a sign of what's to come!  I started to order the combo of chicken breast with Korean spice on the side since I like my chicken crispy and don't care to have it soaking in the sauce.  For my donut I went for the Chipotle Limon; Lemon cake with a hint of chipotle and sprinkled with sugar.  The chicken was definitely crispy and crunchy to the bite; it was well cooked and juicy too!  The Korean spice was a tad bite light for being spicy, but also very generic.  The donut was okay since I generally don't care for them anyways.    In the end, I feel like the concept is cool and caught everyone's attention since it's fried chicken and donuts....2 of America's favorite bites....right!?  Overall, however the combo doesn't really mesh well in my opinion but it's novel. They serve beer here so that's a kicker. - Enjoy!",

The original donut, however, was the best. It was simple, but the texture makes up for it. Sometimes less is more. I only have one complaint.

I don't really eat donuts a lot because of how sweet they are but here they are perfect. I like all the different variety to choose from. I was very surprised that they served ramen here. Even chicken and donuts I'll admit is already an odd combination. But I will say the ramen is good! I highly recommend the Korean glazed chicken!",

Today I was at the bank across the street and wanted something sweet (like a donut...) So I stopped in here. They had ONE (1!) kind of donut. Only ONE. And only four of them. The rest of the racks were empty. It was only 1pm. I think a better name for this place is: 'Welcome, we may or may not have chicken OR donuts when/if you come in'",

Sweet and soft yummilicious, big ole vegan donuts.  They are melt-in-your-mouth delicious!   I have since been back and tried the Maple and Original glaze vegan donuts.  To my knowledge, the vegan donuts are only available on Fridays and Saturdays and the flavors vary each week.  There are other local establishments who sell their vegan donuts daily though (i.e. Volstead).   They offer a vegan ramen dish, but I haven't tried it yet.  On my last visit I discovered that they have a really nice and large patio out back, which I'm sure is popular during cooler months.  The employees are always nice and they serve up service with a smile.  Cool place with cool peeps.",

I'm not sure if my review will really count cuz I didn't even bother to eat the food....all the hype is what kept going thru my mind as I looked at the menu, than the lack of donuts in the case and than back at the menu and than back at the donut case!!!! It was 1:15pm and the line was about 7 ppl deep so I had some time, which I don't know why it took me so long to bounce. I really wanted to love this place cuz I wanted to share the experience & the cool concept w/my nieces but I can't. I'm not gonna pay hella $ for some chix and all they get is like 1 donut to choose from. Maybe it was the time of day or jus hella busy, who knows but nope! Probably won't go back either cuz than that would b doing too much. Also I don't think the AC works well in there and it b smelling like straight up chix grease factory in there, that kind that gets all up in ur clothes.... mmmmm no thank u!

I liked the variety of unusual flavors of the doughnuts but they just weren't what I was hoping for. On top yes crazy things but inside just a plain old basic doughnut. I was hoping for Krispy Kreme soft with some big bold flavor n I didn't get it. Now I will give them another try but living in the West valley I won't go out of my way like I did this time.

I also like that they choose smaller chicken suppliers with a good record.  I enjoyed my meal (breast with Japanese BBQ, Thai slaw, Bacon+Maple donut), though there wasn't anything outstanding about it.  In my opinion what does stand out is the price - about $15 for one fried chicken breast + a donut + a \"natural\" soda.  That's over $40 for three small meals + drinks.  For that (small) amount of food, it's quite pricey, and the quality (while good) wasn't worth it.  Even if I were to just stop by for donuts, they are between $2-3 each.  The food is good, but not the value.",

Unique selection of donuts  Cons:  At 1:30pm the donuts my friend and I both got were dried out and the toppings so sweet we couldn't eat them (saying a lot in our sugar-hyped American food). We got a Cherry Amaretto and Poppy Seed cake. Neither of us would go back for donuts.   Lack of drink selection (canned ginger ale and soda, a bottle black tea and a few meh beers)  I got confused if I was in a friend chicken spot or a fusion Asian restaurant.   Price of the donuts was ridiculous! Premium donuts run $25 for a dozen. Doubt anyone brings those into the office to share!  Lots of hipsters waxing poetically about the glorious nature of the chicken and donuts as if on the 8th day god made fried chicken and donuts and gave it onto Adam the Hipster saying  \"taketh these but do not eat so many or thou may not fit into thy super skinny jeans.\"",

I follow these guys on Facebook and love seeing their new concoctions.  I try to come here as much as possible and see what new offerings they have.  Location is a bit random, but I'm glad they opened it here so maybe it will offer some revival inspiration to the area.    Their maple/bacon donuts are some of the best I've had, as well as their old-fashioned (which are my fave!).  One time we ordered a dozen mixed so we were able to try everything from basic to the more \"artistic.\"  Every donut was awesome!  This place will have a donut for every taste and style and what's great is that they are always mixing it up.  No two days are the same and you can guarantee you will find the perfect donut for you.

    "text": "I do not understand these glowing reviews.  A couple of Saturdays back, I decided to be adventurous and go to Welcome Chicken and Donuts.  When I arrived, the place was packed, with a line out the door.  I thought to myself \"that's a good sign\".  As I got close to the counter, I started checking out the donuts, which actually looked great.  There were a bunch of interesting flavor combinations, so I opted for a full dozen so we could try the full array of their donuts.    The person behind the counter told me that I was going to make somebody very happy when I get home .... then told me it was $27.00 .... not kidding .... $27.00 ... for donuts.  Okay, I can afford that, so I took my dozen donuts and headed home.   I arrive home, and grab a couple small plates, a knife, some napkins, and a small trash can for waste (I had no idea yet of how inportant that last item would be).   My wife and I sat down, and cut thr first donut in half.  We both took a bite .... and we both simultaneously cringed.     YUCK!     The donut tasted horrible.  First off, they tasted more like bread than a donut.  It wasn't just the lack of sweetness of the donut, but it's breadlike consistency (heavy, firm, chewy).  So into the trashcan, and onto the next donut .... and again YUCK ... and again .... and again .... and again, until we had tasted all 12 donuts (and actually not one swallowed bite between the two of us).  So here is the part of this story where I make somebody really happy, just like the counter person predicted.  I dumped the donut remains in the main garbage can, then took the bag out and double bagged it (to make sure they never get out, or poison an animal), then took it out front to our garbage can.  And my wife could not be happier!!!  I have not tried the chicken (and will not, due to the way the donuts worked out).  I do not understand all of these glowing reviews.   Place appears to be some sort of Hipster Cult home I guess.   You've been warned.   DO NOT DRINK THE KOOLAID AND DO NOT EAT THE DONUTS!!!!",

Had the chicken breast combo, with the vietnamese sauce (nice added flavor, but the chicken really doesn't need sauce it's perfect on it's own), seasoned potatoes and it comes with a cake donut too (which was super good, tasted a little lemon-y and went really well with the chicken).   Also got a half dozen specialty donuts to take home. Quite a mix of donuts flavors (cranberry chutney, bread pudding...), more for the adventurous food types.  Also the service is really great and they're super friendly!",

He was very down to earth and helpful. (I'm big on customer service)  We ordered the whole bird and the sauces on the side. The cucumber salad was very fresh and flavorful. The beans were delicious as well. I upgraded and ordered a chocolate donut. I was more amazed by the chicken than the donuts. The chicken was crispy and juicy on the inside. Best fried chicken I've had in PHX. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Donuts, fried chicken, and coffee all in one place? What more could a girl ask for? Looking to fill my saturated fat intake and caffeine jolt for the day, we headed here on a mission for some good eats. There was a fairly steady line while we were here at the restaurant. We got here around noon, and they were already sold out of chicken wings, and at least half of the donuts (Btw, who sells out of chicken wings by lunchtime? Is there a secret coalition of dedicated eaters who descend upon the restaurant like a plague, to only voraciously consume chicken wings in the wee hours of the morning? We may never know...). Anyways, I had a breast combo which included a side and donut. I substituted a chipotle limon donut for the plain cake that is normally included with the meal, and had the slaw and Vietnamese sauce over the chicken. I also had an iced coffee.  The donut was excellent. It had the right balance of tender, yet chewy cake contrasting with the slight crunch on the outside. I also liked how it wasn't exceedingly sugary, which allowed a better balance of flavors to show through.   The slaw was crisp, with a good mixture of sweet and vinegar. My friend had the cucumber salad, which was too salty overall, but had a good crisp texture. The chicken was expertly cooked, with a perfect crispy crust, and juicy, tender meat. I tried some of the Korean spicy sauce and preferred it to over the Vietnamese style sauce on my piece. Strangely enough, the Korean style sauce was more subtle than the Vietnamese sauce, not something you'd often say when comparing the two cuisines! For me, the glaze on my chicken was too concentrated.  The iced coffee was smooth, and had more of a lighter flavor. For add-ins, they have milk, cream, and almond milk, as well as Stevia and sugar in the raw.  Service was fast and friendly, and despite having a steady stream of customers to serve, our orders came out quickly.   Overall, this is a great choice for a fast, affordable, and filling meal. I'll definitely be going here again!",

    "text": "Such an interesting combination of cuisines.  Who knew you could successfully sell donuts, fried chicken AND ramen all under one roof.  It seems to be just what Welcome Chicken + Donuts is doing.  The venue is tidy and trendy.  The photography in the indoor dining area gives it a homey flair.  The wooden benches and tables outside give the outdoor dining area a rustic, picnic-y feel.  The cost is a little bit higher than you might pay elsewhere, but the business seems pretty passionate about its ingredients, their origins and quality, so it would seem that you're paying for food that's higher caliber than that found in cheaper venues.  Overall, the cost isn't prohibitive, and only pinches the wallet a bit more.  The food was good.  I tried the chipotle limon doughnut, which proved to be an interesting flavor combination.  I also ate the vegan ramen -- and upon ordering they asked if I'd like the marinated egg which I thought was ironic (and I did choose to add it on).  The ramen was good.  There were bites of sweet with mildly salty noodles and other vegetables.  I probably would have added some fish sauce or soy sauce, had it been on hand.  No one in our party, coincidentally, ordered chicken, so I can't speak to that, but everyone seemed pleased with their donuts and ramen.  I still can't get over that pairing...but it works!  I'd definitely come back here, but probably for the donuts, not the ramen.  Like, I actually might come back for the donuts before I move.  I want to try 'em all!",

I ordered the Chicken Breast Combo with the Japanese BBQ Sauce and a side of watermelon. I was thankful my friend cut the super greasy fried chicken for me as it was strewn with veins, blood and bones; the most disturbing part was the bloody chicken. After two bites, I was set.  The sauce was less than used as it tasted very strongly of soy sauce.   Also purchased a half dozen box of assorted donuts to taste with my family. The Lemon Maple was dry. The Plum Yoghurt Granola's donut was nice and the frosting was tart but with a fermented taste. The Maple Bacon donut looked a lot less like bacon on top and more like coconut; we didn't even bite into it and as soon as it hit our mouths the hickory flavour was too overwhelming and caused 75% of the party to spit it out before even chewing it. The Glazed Donut was boring and dry. The Raspberry Hazelnut's centre lacked the hazelnut but sure did taste like a chocolate pudding cup. The Maple Ring did not have a strong maple flavour but the consistency of the donut was better than the others.   The consistency of the donuts were very dry and more like eating a bread roll and as for the taste, remained unwanted in our mouths for hours. While they were creative in their combinations, it's best to keep in mind that some combinations don't necessarily work well together.",

Of course, my son never made it that far as he salivated over the wide variety of interesting doughnuts in the case.  Get there early because when I went back later in the day, they were nearly cleaned out.  I got a chicken great with Korean chili sauce, a peanut slaw type of side and a cake doughnut. Wish the chicken was slightly more spicy but I can fix that. It was fresh and crispy and they're doing it all farm to table which I really appreciate.  I also read that they do an amazing noodle day on fridays and I will check it out.   The reason for 4 stars is their hours.  This is really far from my home and so I am limited to visiting on the weekends.   Great stop though!",

    "text": "Wow, Welcome Chicken and Donuts is a must visit if you're in the area!!  I was with my pops around lunch time (12:30) on a Thursday and there was no line when we walked in.  We both ordered chicken combos, and we were extremely pleased with the food.  I went with the leg and thigh combo tossed in their Korean Chili sauce, which was so bomb. Messy but finger licking good!  Don't be scared, just get your chicken tossed in whatever sauce you choose :-)  The slaw was more tasty than the cucumbers for the sides.  The Hot Cake Donut it came with was also very good. Not too sweet but the perfect consistency.   We shared an Apple Fritter for dessert.  It was also very good: nice and fluffy interior with a crispy, but not too crispy, outer, with chunks of apple throughout.    I ordered A Classic Maple, Classic Glaze, and Rainbow Sprinkle donuts to go so my wife could have a nice treat when she gets home from work.  I can't wait to come back and try one of the sandwiches and a big bowl of ramen!!",

The best thing on the menu is their Korean style fried chicken, with amazing sauces and sides. My favorite is a thigh and drum with the Vietnamese Herb sauce, and a side of cucumber salad.   Then right after you order, then you look to your left and there is a big display of donuts with amazing flavors. The flavors change, with some returning favorites and some new stuff. You can get some of my favorites, apple fritter or a lemon maple donut. There is always something that is interesting, or something that will catch your eye. Yummy stuff!",

    "text": "Easily the best donut shop in Arizona. Only negative is that they run out of flavors pretty quickly, so it's best to not have a set one in mind.   Maple bacon: my go-to; not too sweet, quality and generous amount of bacon.   Rum mojito: loved the minty aftertaste; refreshing.   Margarita: zest in the glaze adds a nice touch.   Phoenix cream: not an average Boston cream; chocolate glaze has notes of chili or cayenne. Really smart move to cut the sweetness and richness.   Apple/pear butter: filling had pronounced pear flavor; tastes like it had been simmering for hours.   Wings were fantastic. The coating is light and not overly greasy. Tried the Vietnamese (cilantro and fish sauce pair so nicely) and Korean. Wish the Korean was spicier, but love that the sauce tasted like Kimchi juice.   Will be back to try their ramen.",

    "text": "It was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I were trying to find a great spot to eat some breakfast before a day filled with activities. We wanted something somewhat quick and I was scrolling through Yelp I was like Chicken + Donuts? Two of my favorite things in one location? Yup, take me there now!  I have to say that was one of the finer choices I've made in my life because this place would be in my heaven. It's in an odd location, for those of you that don't live nearby but it's worth the drive no matter where you live in AZ.  Fair warning...because this place is just so dang awesome, there will be a line and some waiting involved. However, the staff is efficient and we still got our order within 20 minutes of ordering. It might seem chaotic at first but once you're eating your Chicken + Donuts you won't even remember anything else.   I went with the 1 piece chicken combo. I got my chicken breast tossed in the Japanese Barbecue Sauce (you can get it on the side or plain) and for my side I went with Thai Yum Slaw. I decided to upgrade my donut to their Maple Bacon donut for an extra charge. I can't even begin to describe the Maple Bacon donut. It's just perfect in every way...sweet buttery maple topped with salty crispy bacon on a soft fluffy donut. It's my kryptonite. The chicken was crispy and crunchy yet juicy on the inside. Although it's fried chicken, it's not greasy at all and seasoned pleasantly. I could eat it plain but the Japanese Barbecue was a great combo to the chicken. Lastly, the slaw was yummy and refreshing.   I ordered their cold brew to accompany my meal and it was smooth and it didn't even need any creamer. It was great on it's own. There's so many flavor combos available that I'm going to have to head back to try them all.",

If the chicken was baked, I think the Vietnamese would work better. Haven't tried the Japanese BBQ sauce yet.  I don't think they had Ramen yet last time that I went there... So I can't comment on that.  Their donuts were okay to me, I know I am in the minority but I didn't think they were out of this world. Definitely some fancy combinations available but I wasn't super impressed with the taste of the ones I tried. I would absolutely come back here again and again for their chicken though!",

The best thing from there  was their chili sauce. Sorry to say overall it was  totally not worth it. Had been hearing about it and finally made it in to try it. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!",

The food was absolutely terrible. There was hardly any meat on the greasy, over-battered and over-fried chicken. It tasted like it had been sitting around, and then refried a second time to heat it up. We ended up with a big pile of mostly batter that went in the trash. And the ramen was just as bad. They had dumped a bunch of disparate ingredients on big floppy noodles that were pretty tasteless. After a bite it went straight to the compost pile. The food was not cheap and I will never return. I really don't understand how this place stays in business. Has it become a franchise run by someone other than the original owner? Do they leave management of the food to an unsupervised staff that has no clue as to what they are doing? I understand they own Welcome Diner (where I have never eaten either) and have heard good things about that restaurant; what gives?",

To start with, the external facade and neighborhood are straight up sketchy, so don't be scared off.  I almost was and would have missed something great.  The combination of chicken and donuts is really intriguing but I only got as far as the donuts.  Holy smokes, what great combinations!  Between the 3 of us, we had the apple fritter, the maple-bacon, the blueberry-cream cheese, the cateja, and a few more.  These were some truly wonderful donuts---tender, moist and really fresh tasting.  I had coffee with them and decided that blueberry was my favorite, for now at least.  I'll go back to try the chicken and other delicicous protein based specials.  They have a slightly asian array of side dishes and sauces for the chicken.  The options are limitless and these guys are on to something!  BTW, the staff is really lovely...all kind and helpful!  Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and support this endeavor.  There are some other places that have braved Buckeye road so they are in good company.  Get there by 10 AM for the best selection of yummy treats :)  Go. NOW!!",

I don't get the big deal about donuts. Its fried bread. I've never had a bad 'fresh' donut, even if it fell on the floor!   The service is slow, the prices are high, they seem very disorganized. They were selling items they didn't have (ran out of dark meat chicken long before they stopped accepting orders for it). Took almost 30 minutes for one chicken breast.   This place is clearly a fad right now. As you get older, you'll see this cycle. New donut place, all the rage, lines out the door, outrageous prices and then, after a year or two people decide donuts are bad for them  (remember Krispy Kreme was opening up locations like crazy? Now try to find one.)  There are six booths inside and more seating outside. We didn't have much choice but to go outside since the line to order blocks access to four of the booths. While outside, there are very aggressive bees trying to eat your food. I like bees, but I prefer not to get stung while I'm having lunch. I'm funny that way.  If you want better selection, a nicer atmosphere and delicious chicken, check out Lolo's a couple of miles down the road.  Unless you're a millennial, in which case you and your man-bun will love it here.",

Everything was awesome the skin was crispy even after being coated in finger licking delicious Korean chilli glaze. The donut was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cucumber salad. Wasn't bad, just not my cup of tea. We also got a half dozen doughnuts just to try.

I went specifically for the ramen that they make on the weekends.  It did not disappoint.  The home made pork bone broth is nothing short of amazing with a great depth of flavor/umami.  We also tried the chicken with the Vietnamese sauce.  I loved the sauce and can't believe how super crunchy and crispy they get the outside of the chicken while maintaining a perfectly juicy inside.  Will definitely go back and will try to get there a little earlier to take advantage of a larger selection of donuts.  The service was also great.  Super friendly.  Great job on all fronts.  :-)",

I mean, who doesn't like donuts??) so when I visited Phoenix last week, I had to check out a couple of donut places. As a lover of chicken and waffles, gotta say chicken and donuts as a concept is brilliant. This place won't win over my favorite Union Square Donuts in Somerville, MA, but it's a close second. We ordered chocolate rose pistachio  (the best), orange douglas fir (can't taste the fir but still good), and the maple cheddar (a bit underwhelming), and the chicken with Korean chilli sauce. The sauce is more sour than your typical Korean sauce with gochujang (and sugar/sesame etc.) but still very good (and it's NOT inauthentic as some other reviews claimed). The chicken was amazing - very crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Worth a stop if you're in town!",

LoLo's, Mrs Whites, Welcome Diner, Popeyes, and countless local spots...I just don't like fried chicken.  This is the polar opposite of my Southern born-and-bred, Georgia-native husband.  He LOVES fried chicken.  Oh, I also don't like donuts.  My husband loves the occasionally BoSa donut.  Now he has Rollover too.  Tried them both...meh but more power to them.  I know, I know...but to each their own, right? :)  Insert Welcome Chicken + Donuts.  The first time we tried them out I ordered the 2 piece with Korean sauce, Corn Miso and a Maple Ring.  It was pretty delish.  But having it tossed in the sauce was overpowering for me.  I vowed to try it with the sauce on the side the next time.  And I did.  And it was **GOOD**  Oh.  My.  God.  Taste buds burst into a happy dance!  Is this for real?  Did I just devour a donut (possibly with a little whimper at the end)?  Am I savoring each lightly crisp, flavorful, superbly enhanced by a thick, spicy-sweet Korean sauce bite of fried freaking chicken??  Hubby and I now been here like 5 times.  Hands down, we both agree it is the BEST fried chicken we've ever had.  We ALSO agree they have the BEST donuts we've ever had.  Just the soft but crisp plain donut makes me sigh in delight.  Now there is ALWAYS a line but it moves fast and is just so worth it.  We try not to talk about this place or else we both start impromptu Homer Simpson impressions...  5/5 only because I can't give them more.  You guys have SUCH a great concept - Keep the quality, price, locals and service...then grow this sucker out!",

The Japanese BBQ tasted to me like hoison sauce dumped from a jar and sprinkled with a few sesame seeds.  Be sure to order the chicken with the sauce on the side if taking it to go - I learned after the first time when I got home and what would have been nice crispy chicken was all sogged up with sauce and the sauce had run all over the side dish as well because it was not in a separate container either.  The chicken is awesome, and I want to try the wings but each time there was a sign saying they were sold out -- you would think if they are that popular they would plan for that and have more on hand.    They have a unique selection of donuts that seem a little pricey but I may give them a try soon. Apparently you need to get there early for the donuts too because about half of the flavors were sold out each time I went.",

Welcome's fried chicken has been a bright spot on the menu at their original spot, and I think the chicken here is even better. 10$ for the 3 piece combo gets you a pretty hefty serving. I've had both the spicy Korean and Thai fish sauces, and I think the Korean shines the brightest. It's more balanced than I had expected, with just the right amount of spice, acidity, sweetness, and funk. Some reviewers have found the chicken to be undercooked, and they're welcome to head to any number of spots that will serve them chalky birds. This is properly prepared, juicy, flavorful chicken.   The sides are fresh and tasty. The miso corn is my favorite. It's super crunchy and nicely sweet and salty.   I've only had the plain cake donuts that come along with the combo meals, and they're much better than they should be. My girlfriend doesn't like donuts, but these were crispy, lightly sweet, and nicely cakey numbers that are really satisfying without being overly sweet, and we both agreed that they are among the best we've had.  Long story short: This place is great, and I'm happy to have it downtown.",

That was as expected and our fault for picking this place.  However, despite all the rave reviews, only one person in our group liked the food.  The name says it all:  the only menu choices are chicken, donuts, and ramen.   You do get a few choices of sides and type of sauce, but that's it.  Chicken, donuts, and ramen.  The chicken was very crispy, and the donuts come in unusual flavors, but neither was anything special.  The Japanese dipping sauce was mostly ketchup.  The portions are very small for the price, and the not-very-good donuts are $3 each.  The pork ramen was nearly inedible, it had one piece of pork that was entirely fat, the dish was supposed to include a fish cake but didn't, and the broth had an off flavor.  I don't care for kimchi, but I think the broth would not have been very tasty even without the kimchi. All in all, not good.  I would not come back, and that seems to be the consensus of our whole party.",

He didn't even get the beverage when she asked twice I had to ask one of the ladies who worked there for it a 3rd time she finally got it. All in all me who goes there frequently will never be dining there again and my mom will definitely not be making a trip and I'll make sure none of my friends dine at this establishment again.

Overall, my review stands as a 3/5 stars as it comes down to more of a flavor and quality issue than anything else. While this donut was loaded well with filling, the glaze flavor was more basic than I anticipated...the standard strawberry glaze was flavorful, the granola sweet and cinnamony, the filling though, definitely lacked spark and flavor density...the dough was a little dry and dense than I tend to prefer...so, I wouldn't get again, but it was a decent representation of the originality and fun offered by this establishment.  One hiccup: Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a nasty drive for me as I live in Peoria...  I intend on trying more to hopefully round-out my review, but current only wish: pre-posting on social media of new flavors/combos of the general AND donut menu so I can coordinate when to go...",

    "text": "Have seen this place all over Instagram and have been wanting to try it out for a while. Arrived at around 12pm on a Tuesday afternoon. There were a few people sitting down and eating and only one person ahead of us in line. I ordered the two piece combo with a side of potatoes and a classic glazed donut. I upgraded the donut from the warm old fashioned one that comes with it but I'm not sure how much extra that cost since I didn't look at the receipt. I am quite a plain person so I just got the chicken naked with no sauce.  The chicken was absolutely AMAZING!! The skin was perfectly crunchy and the meat inside was so tender and juicy! My friend order the chicken sandwich and said she wanted to eat another one immediately after finishing the first. The donut was super tasty as well.  I would definitely go back again to try other options because it all looked so good!",

    "text": "Like it's big brother, Welcome Diner, I've delayed visiting this place for far too long. This is partly due to their limited hours as rarely am I ever in this area before 4pm. Actually, I don't think I'm ever in this area - period. But still . . .   The concept is simple. Chicken and donuts. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that fried chicken works well with anything - and so do donuts, so why not specialize in both?   If it's your first time, ordering a combo is your best option. I ordered two drumsticks with the standard cake donut and a side of seasoned potatoes. My girlfriend ordered a breast with a side of the corn stir fry.   I requested a chocolate cake donut to add on to my combo, but they apparently misunderstood me when I said I still wanted the hot cake donut. Thankfully, my girlfriend cut hers in half - which is probably good, since it ended up being my favorite. We also ordered a glazed donut on the way out.  I confess: The chicken here is extremely good! There's a satisfying crunch and great flavor found within. My girlfriend and I both agreed that, while not quite the best we've found in our Phoenix search, it's definitely right up there. I intend to try it in sandwich form during our eventual return.  As for the sauces? Eh, I honestly don't think they're even necessary with this chicken. It stands on its own just fine, but feel free to experiment. We strongly disliked the Vietnamese herb, which was too salty, while my spicy barbeque just seemed unnecessary. The seasoned potatoes were excellent, being cooked nice and crispy, exactly how I've always liked them. My girlfriend was also pleased with her corn stir fry.  The donuts are good, with my favorite being the hot cake donut due to my love of donuts in their simplest form. The chocolate cake was okay, while the glazed was better than I expected. They seem to be quite fond of adding lemon zest, which I'm pretty sure was present to varying degrees in all of the donuts. We liked them, but it's not like great donuts are scarce in Phoenix. They're comparable to what you'd find at most of the more popular (locally owned) donut shops.  I still wish they had better hours - as this is a place that could easily operate late into the night and probably do quite well. But for what it is, I feel it's a place that everyone needs to try out.  Good stuff!",

As often as I can, I try to eat at the restaurant, but for location that offer a large% of their orders to go, I check out that option. I don't deduct points nor stars towards the temp of the food, but I was impressed how crunchy the skin my breast with sweet & spicy Korean Chili with cucumber side (great crunch + flavor). If you are going to under-season (need a touch more salt) the chicken, your sauce has to be rock solid. Korean Chili was more sweet & not enough spicy.  I ate most of the chix with no sauce & enjoyed the pickled cucumber side!  The donut flavors were creative.  We all had a bite or two of almost all the offerings for that day.",

Chicken: not very meaty, tons of crispy breading. Sides: only 3 options. Plain donut: boring. Fancy donuts: hit and miss, chocolate disgusting while lemon and coconut were delicious. What made this visit terrible was that I waited 45 minutes for my sandwich while my family ate, and even after reminding them twice about that one last thing they missed, they ultimately just forgot. It wasn't even that busy. They refunded my $ but I left hangry. They were in no rush because other than the pink haired delightfully helpful employee, everyone else seemed to be enjoying a nice buzz.",

Seating inside is limited, but there are plenty of tables outside to enjoy your food!  It's more of a casual place so you order first and find a seat!  I ordered: THIGH AND DRUM COMBO - This chicken is sooooooooooooo good - it's super crispy which I love but it's also so juicy inside - It also comes with a sauce which I think is almost the best part! - The pieces of chicken aren't super big, so beware if you're hungry maybe order a few more pieces  THAI SLAW - this comes with the combo as a side - this was surprisingly really good - I had my doubts, but the peanut taste in the slaw makes it perfect!  RED WINE CHOCOLATE PUDDING DONUT - a wine donut,,, HOW COULD I RESIST -  you can definitely taste the wine, it was a little strong for me  - the chocolate pudding inside saved it! - I love filling in donuts so this was definitely a great decision for me!  Overall, love this place and would recommend to anyone in the area!",

The Indonesian peanut sauce was savory but lacking heat. A little but of siracha will do wonders but it was delicious regardless. Also tried the Korean wings and I felt they were too vinegar and needed a little sweetness. Overall, the chicken stands up to the high raves.  Bad: Donuts... We ordered the chocolate passion fruit pistachio and a rose strawberry rhubarb one. Both the donuts were oily and stale, especially the chocolate one. When I bit into it the first bite was just oil...bleh. it seemed like the donut wasn't fried well or just sat out too long and the oil soaked in? Either way it was gross and there was no pistachio or passionfruut flavor evident. The rose strawberry rhubarb was better but not by much. The cake donut was once again oily and while the rhubarb jam was good, it was a very tiny dollop. The strawberry glaze was average and nothing to rave abt and also not worth the 3+ dollars it cost. Both the donuts were overpriced, underwhelming and oily....avoid these!  If I went back it would be for the chicken and not the donuts...never the donuts. But go there and get the chicken!",

We came on a Saturday for lunch and each enjoyed a combo of the two piece chicken and a donut, plus a side. We both got Korean chili chicken, I got the balsamic pear donut and my husband got the chocolate pistachio rose donut. I got the cucumber salad side and my husband got the slaw.   It was ridiculous.   The chicken was perfectly crispy but surprisingly light and juicy covered in an amazing spicy sweet Korean sauce garnished with scallions, and after I had my first bite, I couldn't talk. You know when you're sitting around the table with your family and your mom made your favorite dish and somebody goes, \"it must be good, the whole table went silent!\"? It was like that, but in an old booth in a renovated KFC serving the best food I've eaten all year.   The donuts were exquisite. The artisan donuts that this unassuming place pumps out... I can't comprehend it. My pear balsamic donut had a great natural pear flavor with a tart/sweet thing going on that ruled. My husbands chocolate pistachio rose donut was my favorite though, for the salty/sweet plus crunch deal. It was just all so good.   tl;dr: this place is unassuming perfection with the best chicken I've ever eaten, a great outdoor space, good donuts and Stevie Wonder on the speakers. It's a must.",

I was expecting a lot more from some of the hype I've heard. I ordered the breast and drumstick with potatoes. The chicken was pretty good, excellent crunch and coating. The potatoes were not that good. I don't know how to explain it but there was a weird taste to them. The best part of this experience was my plain jane original glazed donut. That was absolutely one of the best donuts I've had. Super soft, gooey and sweet.",

My first foray into the heaven of sugar was a donut covered in cheddar \"Apple fritter with Wisconsin Cheddar\". A bit dubious I went with the flow. Handed over to me my eyes widened. I thought donuts were required to have a hole in the middle.  No. This cheddar donut was humongus - about the size of my hand. Filled with a gooey creamy sweat something I was very happy. Motivated by this wonderful experience I ordered another to take home. Based simply on looks I took home a white iced donut with sprinkles. In hindsight this was an excellent means to create a sugar coma first thing in the morning. It was the breakfast of champions.  Will is the best, most awesome employee *ever* to walk this earth. That kid is full of energy and can make anyone laugh.  I can only imagine what eating a combination of donut + fried chicken could do to my system at the same time. I might just die.",

    "text": "You know that old saying about movies, if you have a good story everything will take care of itself? Well, this is the food version of that story - you focus on unique and great food, using top quality ingredients, and you can be in the literal middle of nowhere and the people will come. Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a literal foodie field of dreams, run by a decidedly young group of entrepreneurial hipster folks that would blend in with the folks in Portland or Seattle but instead, are busy making great food near the airport car rental places on Buckeye Road.  They have a great selection of innovative and top quality donuts, and then they have amazing fried chicken, that you can get just fried or with several different types of Asian country inspired sauces (coated in those sauces so get plenty of napkins). I took my father and we tried both the Japanese BBQ style - a thick sauce and dusted with sesame seeds, and the Vietnamese herb style with the chicken coated in a sauce that is heavy on the fish sauce, but in a good way - pungent and salty, it reaches out and gives you a solid slap across your taste buds - nibble on the free cake doughnut (warm and fresh) that comes with it to help balance out the intensity of the sauce.   You also get one of several Asian country inspired side dishes - we got the cucumber salad which also helped to mellow out the overal food experience. If you sit on the inside, towards the front, is some history of the building and the location which helps to ground the business in some of the local history and culture.   As for costs - a one piece is $7.50, a thigh and a drumstick are $8 and those two pieces along with a breast are $10 - might as well go for the three piece kids and save a piece to gnaw on later, when you start missing this amazing food experience. Oh, if you want wings - 6 for $6 (and it is the full wing so well priced) or an even dozen for $11, get there early - I've heard those sell out before everything else.   Best bet for this place might be to send one person to pick up multiple orders and then bring them back to the homestead, and you can enjoy this messy and pungent mishmash of southern food culture and Asian flavors without any concerns on the level of messiness involved - or, if you want that crispy, crispy coating at its peak, do make a point to go down directly but either way should be equally delicious. Here is hoping they expand and open something like this near downtown Tempe but if not, I'm sure at least once a month I'll take the time to drive down for one of the more unique food experiences one can find as a native or on a  trip to Phoenix.",

So today I finally decided to satisfiy my curiosity. I walked in. Immediately, I noticed a comfortable delight carried by the local patrons that frequent this establishment.  I gazed upon the menu to both grasp the mystique of this locale and to see what I wanted to eat. They have a simple variety of items to choose from. Their is a bevy of donuts to choose. Interesting choices such as maple bacon to your traditional favorites; such as chocolate, maple, and glaze. Then theres the chicken. You can order chicken with three different flavors. I happened to choose the spicy thai. A personal favorite but theirs other choices. They also have sandwiches and side items to choose from.  Verdict. The donut was great. Very fresh and contained a myriad of flavors. The chicken was plentiful. The batter was tasty and the meat thick. The flavor of the spicy thai was outstanding. All in all the food was very good. They also have coffee on tap, which I found as a classic revival.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out if your ever close by.",

I ordered the Korean chili chicken, (asian) slaw, with a sprinkles cake donut.  Was highly impressed, the chicken was fried to a nice crisp and it was sauced tossed to perfection as to not goo it up.  The flavor was on point, I frequent Korean chicken joints in LA and this is definitely up to par.  The donut was eaten bit by bit after each mouthful of the chicken followed by slaw each time to clear the palate.  They also were nice enough to throw in an extra donut on my way out, that i am saving for dessert after whatever i scrounge up in my kitchen tonight.",

    "text": "I'll say this for the Welcome Hospitality crew.  They're a fearless bunch.  In Welcome Diner, they took a chance on an old dingy diner near Downtown and turned it into arguably one of the top dining spots in the valley.  They owe that success not only to taking chances with their locations, but with their food.  With Welcome Diner, they've married traditional diner fare, farm to table ingredients, southern recipes, and even vegetarian friendly fare.  In Welcome Chicken & Donuts, they've taken a chance in another questionable neighborhood while serving traditional donuts as well as fried chicken with an Asian spin.  Asian chicken and donuts?  Makes no frickin sense at all, but (for the most part) it works.  Seeing that they didn't serve chicken until after 10:30am, I decided to venture here just before the Noon hour for Sunday lunch.  Much to my surprise, the place was PACKED.  Turns out they were having a special today that tons of folks showed up for.  It was a pork ramen dish that apparently takes the Welcome crew about two days to make.  More than half the patrons I saw were there just for that reason.  I was tempted to join in on that party, but as a rookie I wanted to get a better feel for the regular menu.  The line was about 12 deep when I arrived, but moved pretty quickly.  I decided to go with a three piece + donut combo (a drum, a breast, a thigh, and a donut), but I made some modifications based on some of the early reviews I read.  I decided to ask for all three of their sauces (instead of just one) and asked that they be put on the side.  Costs a couple bucks extra, but its definitely the way to go if you're a first timer.  I also got one of each of their three sides (instead of just one).  Again, a couple bucks extra but the side portions are all pretty small so no big deal.  For a drink I went with the Big Sky Root Beer.  For my donut choice, I asked the guy at the counter what their most popular donut was (since there were more than a dozen types to choose from that day).  Without hesitation, he said the maple bacon.  Sold.  Total cost for everything including tax came to about $22.  Because of the lengthy order queue, they gave me my donut and drink first and had my chicken and sides ready about 5 minutes later.  The inside was packed so I sat outside under their large pergola (which also had misters, making it decently comfortable despite being 105 outside).  I've had maple bacon donuts at other donut shops before but the bacon is often super dry.  Welcome's bacon was actually quite juicy and the maple glaze was very liberally applied.  One of the better versions of this donut I've had.  The Big Sky Root Beer was quite good as well and didn't have a heavy aftertaste like I usually get with A&W or Mug (maybe its because Big Sky is made with sugar instead of corn syrup?).  Once I got my chicken, sauces, and sides 5 minutes later, I went to work on those.  The chicken was also quite good and I liked the fact the batter wasn't too heavy.  The meat itself was hot and juicy and soaked up the sauces easily.  The sauces themselves on the other hand weren't really my cup of tea.  Maybe the Asian themed sauces were a bridge too far for me, but I wasn't hugely impressed with any of them.  The Vietnamese sauce tasted a little too watery and bitter for my liking.  Similarly the Korean Chili sauce had a tangy texture that I just didn't care for (at least not on my chicken).  The Japanese BBQ sauce was probably the one I liked best, but even that was a little overpowering on the tomato front for my taste.  The chicken held its own without any sauce so it wasn't a huge deal, but I'm glad I did the sauces on the side instead of on the bird.  I was however very impressed with all three side options.  The Thai Yum Slaw was a fairly typical coleslaw, though not nearly as much mayonnaise as most coleslaws (which was a good thing in my book).  The Corn & Miso Stir Fry was also a light, pleasantly textured side and I think I picked up some green chiles in there.  And the Cucumber Salad had a great clean taste with just a hint of ginger and a cold crunchy texture.  Pretty much the only thing that didn't work for me here were the sauces for the chicken.  I guess I felt they were a little bit of an overpowering contrast with the chicken itself, though the sauces probably would work well as accompaniments for Asian noodle dishes (or in today's case, the Ramen promotion).  In any event, my first experience here was a positive one.  The staff was cool, and the (largely hipster) customers was super enthusiastic.  I would absolutely come back for more of those donuts, and the chicken and sides would both do well as lunch staples.  And its really cool to see how Welcome has livened up this otherwise questionable area just west of Sky Harbor Airport.  Tip of the cap to the Welcome Hospitality crew for taking another chance on a concept and a location that no one else in their right mind would try.  And succeeding.",

The building doesn't look like much from the outside, and even once you come inside it doesn't blow you away. The outside patio is quite nice (and I assume they will be working on the outside of the building a bit more considering they haven't been open for long and still have an ad for the old business on their doors).  However, you come here for the food. I ended up getting a dozen wings with korean chili. These wings are not tiny wings like you get at other places, so half a dozen was more than enough for me (but I get dinner for later). The taste was wonderful. It was the right amount of spice and a little sweetness. The green onions were a good addition. However, as most wings are, these are super messy. However, having to lick off the extra sauce at the end was a nice bonus.  I ended up getting a chipotle limon sugar donut. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. I really wanted to replicate the chicken and waffle taste palette, but screwed up with the sauce wings and non plain donut.",

We came on a Sunday around brunch time, and the place was packed despite its odd location, close enough to Downtown Phoenix but seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The array of donuts in the glass display was enough to make my mouth melt: Pistachio Chocolate, Blueberry Cookie, and Strawberry Cheesecake, to name a few. In addition, the chicken menu had the choice of three Asian flavors: Korean Chili, Japanese BBQ, and Vietnamese Herb.  My husband and I both opted for the Korean Chili and ordered three donuts to try. We settled into a booth with cute chicken and donut characters painted on the wall. As I took a bite into the Pistachio Chocolate, my taste buds went wild. What a perfect balance! Often, a gourmet donut taste too much like a baked good passed off as a donut, but in this case the donut was baked just as it should be- and then elevated to the next level. And the chicken? Yes, yes, yes! The skin, lathered in red Korean Chili, was not overpowered by heat, but had just enough zing and crunch to it to make every bite mouthwatering and addictive. The Chicken and Donuts combo is genius - its chicken and waffles with a modern day twist. Thank you Chicken and Donuts for bringing this to Phoenix!",

Staff was extremely helpful with the menu & in making a selection with the flavors, sides and drinks (limited choices with beverages but decent). I got my flavor on the side as I wanted to check out the flavor of the chicken. I deviated from the combo and got a breast & thigh so I could try both white & dark meat. Both were good, but really dry making it hard to enjoy as is. Overcooked so the sauce was needed. It was 112 degrees outside so I was looking for a cool indoor location but it was still warm inside for me followed by piping hot chicken when served. I would go back but it didn't overly exceed my expectations like so many have discussed. Donuts selection was good.",

I decided to stop by because I was in this side of town to get my car serviced. I had to fulfill the craving. I got the breast combo with Korean Chili with cucumber salad. For $8.50, you get a gigantic chicken boob, donut and side.   I got their 24 oz cold brew (which is nice and strong ) if you can't handle too much bitterness, ask for extra room for cream/almond milk etc. I realized after I placed my order that I could've got a beer instead but I guess I'll save the beer pairing for next time lol. Awesome juxtaposition of flavors; get weird with it!! Cheers",

I very rarely eat donuts or stuff like that, but this was worth the unhealthiness! It's not in the best area, but it was worth the trip. The donut shop is real small, but the outdoor seating area in the back is really nice. I don't eat meat, but I saw people had ordered the chicken and it looked to be good quality. Also I was surprised to see that there were cocktails on the menu, that's pretty cool!  I had a hard time deciding which donut to order! I decided to get one unique one and one more classic one, and they were both vegan! I went for the Thai Arnold Palmer and Double Chocolate and shared with my family. We all loved them! They were sweet without being too sweet. I wasn't sure what I expected the tea one to taste like, I was unsure of it, but I really enjoyed it. I'm a believer in weird donuts now. The chocolate donut was pretty good, but I preferred the other one. Prices weren't too bad either for fancy donuts ha. This was a tasty experience I would recommend for donut lovers.",

Im usually just a plain fatty kinda guy that like long johns, chocolate frosted, and bear claws....but these buujee donuts here are insane! Considering that DunkinDs sells their donuts for $1.00 each, these hand crafted ones are worth the small difference.  I suggest the lemon cake one.",

Let me tell you that I was not disappointed when I finally got to try them.  Its just a small little restaurant, run by some really nice people. But what they are able to achieve is pretty cool.  Both my wife and I got the 3 piece chicken and donut. I got the Japanese bbq and she got the Korean Spicy. We ended up trading a piece so both of us could try the other. I was really impressed. Both flavors were really bold and tasty. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of batter. The slaw that I got as a side was really good as well.  I upgraded my donut to one with blueberry cream cheese icing and it was good. But really for me it was the chicken that stole the show.  Give this place a try. Its small little business like this one, and of course its big brother Welcome Dinner, that help gives Phoenix its flavor.",

I don't know about anyone else but I know for myself that when I see food already cooked and sitting out .. it means not fresh.  Not only that they place is called Welcome Chicken and Donuts.... I promise there was about 6 donuts in the case.  I even asked about this and was told ... yeah they go quickly and they don't make another batch.   Not another batch and there is 3 hours till close!  Wow... mind you there were trays of fried chicken but like 6 donuts...wasn't the whole menu based on chicken and donuts.  Let's just say wasn't impressed at all.   Have food please till close... or at least up to 30 min till close.  Customers that rush to get to your place before you close are the ones you want to keep coming back.",

The selection of doughnuts was not only appealing to the eye, but even more appealing to the stomach. The coffee here is locally roasted and fair trade from Colombia (Blue House Coffee) and my taste buds could definitely tell the love and time it when it when it was freshly brewed. They have vegan options too! You would've never thought! It's kind of a shady neighborhood but the extra precaution you take to hide all of your valuables and secure your car like Ft. Knox is definitely worth every succulent bite of their maple bacon doughnut that is very generous on the bacon! The owner is in collaboration with other local restaurants and is featured thorough out Phoenix for a good reason. They're DELICIOUS. The music I heard while in there is very indie--my favorite. Death Cab for Cutie, Noah and the Whale, and he Lumineers!

My wife doesn't really like chicken but she loves donuts I'm sure this chicken will change her mind! Must try! I read a review where they said bad customer service and got to say if it was before it isn't now. The woman who took my order was very nice and patient and the men cooking were very nice with big smiles! So, I will recommend them to anyone I come across! Go try some Chicken & Donuts tonight you won't regret it!",

We ordered a two piece and a bowl of ramen.The ramen looked beautiful but was absolutely horrible. It tasted like dirty water. I don't even think they used canned broth. Nothing even close to the flavor pork bone ramen should taste like. If I were rating based on the ramen it would have been a 1 star. The chicken and donuts were both super greasy. The sauce on the side was really tasty but  it was hard to dip the chicken in because of the grease.  I went in to buy another donut since my ramen was inedible. I quietly told the lady taking orders about the ramen and the terrible taste and was simply told she would let the chef know . I felt cheated out of a good meal. I will not be back here.",

    "text": "I went this morning -- my second visit -- specifically for coffee and a doughnut. Despite being right down the road from work, I don't envision a return trip anytime soon.   My first visit weeks ago was for lunch and a chicken combo. I got the chicken plain with BBQ on the side since I like my chicken sparely sauced but I ended up more in the mood for just plain ol' fried chicken, so I set the sauce aside and dove in. Bad move: The chicken was unseasoned. I mean there wasn't a grain of salt to be found anywhere near it. Nor did I detect any pepper or garlic or any spice. There wasn't even a salt shaker on the table. As another reviewer noted, this might because the sauces are apparently so flavorful that the good folks at Welcome don't want the bird to be overly seasoned, but the chicken was practically inedible by itself. It was crispy but in a heavy, overly greasy way, not in a fresh-fried way. I guess the double-frying method helps it stand up to the sauce but it just tasted like oil to me. The cucumber salad was refreshing, thought. I forget what flavor doughnut I got then -- some kind of berry-flavored iced thing -- which should tell you how memorable it was.   This morning I got a cardamom sugar doughnut and a 12-ounce coffee. They were OK but a few things ruined the taste for me:   1. The smell of the shop was rancid. I don't know if the grease trap overflowed last night or the refrigerator broke down over the weekend and all the chicken went bad or what, but one whiff of the putrid stench inside almost made me turn around. I stood in front of the display case trying to decide what awesome-looking doughnut to get but my appetite was disappearing with each minute I stood there.   2. I paid $3.58 for a 12-counce coffee and a glorified sugar doughnut. The doughnut was just fine but honestly, it's nothing special. The coffee was even more forgettable. I guess if I'm going to spend up to $3 on a doughnut, I want it to be noteworthy. In a good way, not the way it was for me this morning.   So, dear reader, be cautious of all the reviewers here and otherwise who are tripping over themselves to see how many times they can use the word \"amazing\" to describe what is pretty much a serviceable if smelly doughnut shop. Truth be told, I'll most likely give them another shot but if it's as rank then as it was this morning, I'll get my doughnut fix on Friday mornings when someone in the office usually swings by Bosa and brings in a box.",

    "text": "Going to try and be honest as possible with this review. I went there with very high hope, I thought Chicken + Donuts was a really cool and unique combo because most people love both and it's different from the typical Chicken + Waffle thing that everyone is doing now. The atmosphere was pretty simple but had it's own unique original feel to it. Excellent and friendly customer service, pretty cool people. Now to the food.  I was overwhelmed with all the different variety of donuts they had to choose from and was given a sample of their newest \"Maple Butter Corn\" donut (I think that's what it was called). Wasn't impressed at all, the taste did not live up to the presentation nor the price. I can't remember exactly but I believe they charge close to or just over $3 for one, definitely not worth it. I ended up ordering the 3-piece combo with a donut on the side which was a classic glaze because I figured you can't go wrong with an orignal glazed donut. I was wrong, the glazed donut was flavorless with a sugar + water pastey like glaze. You'd be better off going to your local donut shop and will get more bang for your buck. The chicken was pretty good, if you're not into kind of exotic tastes I suggest getting your suaces on the side, very unique tasting sauces but not bad just different. The Miso-Corn stir fry was AMAZING!!!! I'd literally drive across town for that side alone. My date ordered the chicken salad and said it was \"really good\".   Final verdict on this place: I'd recommend it if you're in the area but it's not a must. There's nothing about this place that gives an experience you can't get anywhere else. SO if you're in the area go give it a try, if you don't you're not missing much. You can wait until it's convenient for you.",

    "text": "10+ times eating here, and Welcome Chicken + Donuts is superb every time (with an understandable exception and a slight disclaimer noted below).  I first heard about Welcome Chicken + Donuts from Welcome Diner (same owners).  My first time in I ordered the Korean chili chicken. I returned the following day to eat the same thing and my next few visits were also for the Korean chili chicken. It has an amazing taste and quality to it. The sauce topped with fresh green onions over crispy and moist fried chicken is pure excellence.  To this day it's one of my favorite foods and continues to impress me. My disclaimer is that I've never tried any of the other chicken sauces (Japanese BBQ or Vietnamese Herbs), so my review is somewhat incomplete in this sense. In my experience the folks at Welcome can do no wrong when it comes to food, so I trust the other sauces would be good, but the Korean chili is too compelling for me to bother trying anything else. I enjoy the sides that come with the chicken, particularly the Thai Yum Slaw. The sides add a nice dose of healthy to the meal and each has a unique taste. A+++++ lunch spot if you enjoy spicy chicken (it's not terribly spicy, but there's a kick to it).  I'm not big on doughnuts, so it took me until they started serving their breakfast sandwiches (which aren't on the main menu) all day on the weekends to realize that they had more than doughnut options for breakfast. The SXSW breakfast sandwich with bacon is delicious. It contains a soft-fried egg, cheese, your choice of bacon or sausage, and a jalapeno sauce served between a sliced plain cake doughnut. The flavors mesh together really well and it's different than what you'd find at a typical breakfast restaurant. I love it and often make breakfast trips here just for the SXSW.  This brings up my biggest complaint about Welcome Donuts. (I call this place Welcome Donuts if I'm going for breakfast and Welcome Chicken for lunch/chicken.) They seem to run out of plain cake doughnuts for this breakfast sandwich frequently. It's happened twice where they were out and couldn't make the sandwich and once when I had to wait for a new batch that was being made. It definitely stinks when you make the trip specifically for this item and then it's not available at 10:00 AM on a Sunday (fortunately it's only a 7 minute trip for me.) That being said, this place hasn't been around for that long and I fully expect them to get better at having a supply ready. I do appreciate that everything is freshly made using locally sourced ingredients, enough to understand their being unable to make a breakfast sandwich sometimes.  Welcome Donuts gets a lot of press for their doughnuts, and for good reason. They are freshly made in house the day you order them and there are always several varieties to choose from. I love seeing them on display as you might see art on display. I have ordered some doughnuts, and when I do I typically enjoy them although a couple varieties have been a miss for me. On the other hand, the sweet corn and rosemary doughnut is incredibly good. I never would've tried it based on the name, but the guy at the counter recommended it to the customer ahead of me as their best doughnut in the display. Welcome Donuts are also served at DeSoto Central Market, which is perfect for me since I enjoy working in the atmosphere of DeSoto.  Everything about Welcome is great. I mainly focused on their food, but their service and local  community support is just as good. Most of the times I'm in Welcome Chicken + Donuts I'm asked by an employee or manager how I liked the food. Their passion for food and welcoming (get it?) customers goes a long way to create an awesome business I love to support. It's also cool how their restaurants are both in less-frequented areas and uplift the neighborhoods they enter. Their chicken is purchased whole and fresh from a local Arizona farm. Other ingredients are directly sourced as well. The owners love Phoenix and it shows. They have created two great local restaurants and I heard they're looking to open a third one, which I'm excited for. Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a Phoenix staple serving some of the best food possible, and it certainly deserves its name, \"Welcome.\"",

I ordered the breast combo which is $8.50. I wanted the maple bacon donut, the guy behind the counter, said there is an up charge, I said fine. Then I got the bill, $11.08, I was like wow for a piece of chicken, some potatoes and a donut. I should have went with my gut and cancelled the order.  So the chicken breast was really dry and the donut tasted like the ones you get on sale at Frys food store.   The customer service was great but can't make up for the overpriced, average tasting food. I saw some of the cooks in back laughing, they must have been laughing at me for thinking this place was great, and giving them way too much money.  In the kitchen they had a huge rack of fried breasts, legs, wings, all just sitting there, I'm like how long do you guys leave this chicken out in 80 degree temps.  So like I said, just don't get the hype, it's almost like they are the only donut shop in the valley and can charge whatever. I will never be back no value or taste here. I was gonna take a picture, then I was like why.",

I have some food sensitivities so I haven't had any of the sauces and just get plain chicken, but it's SO PERFECTLY cooked and delicious, and doesn't take a long time to get once you order. Plus the donut options are plentiful and always great. The one with the passion fruit glaze is the winner for me, but I've liked everything I've had. But seriously, if they have passion fruit when you go, you gotta try it.  Also every time I'm here the staff is just so friendly and personable. It makes me enjoy going here all the more. Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Interesting concept for a foodie, but my first visit did not leave me stricken with the itch to ever return.  I'm sure I'm going to upset many who really like this place.  I'm glad you do, keep spending money there if that's your thing, it definitely wasn't mine.  One disclaimer: I have a Thai wife that cooks amazing food for our family, so I have high standards for Asian food or fusion.  I also spent a lot of time in Asia trying many different foods and experiencing Asian flavor.  First and foremost, I thought it was ridiculously expensive when the location is not Tempe, or Scottsdale, and the quantity of food is sparse when served!  I spent nearly $10 for a twice fried 1/2 chicken breast (normal sized, not big like Bushes), and maybe a 2 oz Thai slaw with 1 ounce of Korean Sweet and Spicy sauce, and complimentary naked mini donut that wasn't all that good.  Coleslaw was  simply okay, but I've had many better non-creamy slaw.  The chicken had very cripsy skin, good flavor, but it was also very dry.  I'm guessing wings, or dark meat are a much better choice here.  Value was just not there for me, and honestly, I felt Canes or Bushes chicken taste better and you get nearly 2x the food for the same price!  I left still hungry, but didn't want to let go of anymore of my hard earned money when better food and better value is elsewhere to be found.  Glaze, or cake donuts are $3 each, I don't get it?  They aren't designer donuts made fresh for you one at a time.  Places like Bosa, LaMars, Beyond Donuts, and Lucky's all have fantastic donuts for less than $1 each.  At Lucky's you can get a dozen for a little over $8, and if you ever go - try their red velvet cake donut!  Lamars is the most expensive at $11/dozen, but they are well worth the $1 a piece.  Obviously, this place has fans, but I don't understand how they stay in business for the price charged versus their quantity and quality of food.  It's a mystery to me?  Not sure why more people haven't commented that for $10  - 1 piece of fried chicken is a bit gouging.  Also, other items on their menu are priced higher than any competitor in the valley.  These seem like NY City prices in the barrio of AZ, go figure!",

Ordering is simple.  You pick your chicken + your sauce and then you pick your doughnut.  Small upgrade fee for more premium donuts of course.  Not a problem at all.  Their donuts look high end gourmet!  I couldn't resist taking half a dozen home with me.  The fried chicken definitely holds up to it's hype.  Mix in a donut and you've yourself a life changing semi fast food meal.  Make sure you sit outside in there grand patio.  Huge picnic tables that are shaded from the AZ sun!",

I was able to score one of the last bowls at about 12:30.  Fish the kimchee out first . . . it's stellar, but I wouldn't want my whole bowl tasting of kimchee  The donuts . . . they are not messing around.  These are gourmet donuts  Get the chicken with the sauce on the side.  The sauces are powerful.  And order all three for a small upcharge, it's worth it  They now have beer!  It's only a few bottled varieties for now, but they're carefully chosen  I love this place, and I love their other joint the Welcome Diner.  Great one two punch",

Our normal spot wasn't serving dinner yet so my husband and I decided to try Welcome.   I wouldn't have had such an issue with the food had the service been better. As I said I almost never eat chicken and as soon as I cut into the thigh, red juice comes pouring out of pink meat.  Then when I return it to your window asking for it to be cooked longer and instead of doing so, I'm given a stern lecture about how their chicken is cooked and return to my seat with pink chicken, I am NOT pleased. I was told the chicken is fried twice to eliminate the possibility of being medium rare.   The girl at the counter rolled her eyes when I asked for not pink chicken, which tells me this is a frequent request. Then she tells me that the \"blood\" I'm seeing gush out of this chicken thigh is actually baby chicken bone marrow. Congratulations, you have officially killed my appetite.",

    "text": "This place is a gift from the heavens.   I would like to offer a suggestion as to what to get when you go to Welcome, but unfortunately I have no suggestion because you cannot go wrong. Here are some of my favorites though:  1) The Chicken- I'm fairly certain that the chicken was raised in the Garden of Eden and prepared by Chuck Norris and Beyonce. It's perfect. Upon taking a bite of this chicken, you experience an ecstasy that sends shivers through your spine. You experience a change that rocks you to the core of your being. You become a savage, ravenously devouring bite after bite with reckless abandon. After returning from this out of body experience, you are left panting, covered head to toe in Korean Chili sauce, and begging for more. This chicken will haunt your dreams; it will fill your thoughts; it might even threaten your dearest relationships because it is the only thing that satisfies you anymore.   2) The Iced Toddy- I want to fill a bathtub with this liquid gold so I can soak in it. A taste of this divine beverage is like the first day of spring after a long, cold winter. When you thought that the world was left hopeless following the death of the King of Pop, Blue House Coffee brought us hope in the form of an iced, caffeinated beverage. Imagine the edginess of \"Bad\", the simplicity of \"Black or White \", and the pure joy of \"Man in the Mirror.\" Now take all of those feelings and put them into a cup of coffee. That is Blue House's iced toddy: the reincarnation of Michael Jackson's music.  3) Every Donut- The donuts are freedom. With ever bite, you find yourself feeing more alive. Like up to this point, everything seemed ok, but now that you have taken a bite from this donut, you know what pure joy tastes like. The case is like a portal into a newfound happiness.   Go to Welcome Chicken + Donuts. It's amazing.",

    "text": "Every other establishment on earth that successfully sizzled their way into the upper echelon of quintessential fried foods committed to making chicken OR doughnuts really, really well. The magic of Welcome C+D is in the \"+\"  Welcome Chicken + Doughnuts is obliterating \"or\" as a conjunction altogether. You get to have it all, without sacrificing your standards for obnoxiously hip, artisan doughnuts that are ring-shaped renditions of craft cocktails and high quality, free range, bilingual chickens doused in authentic, savory Asian sauces.  So while indulging my \"ind\" (a culinary-Freudian fusion of \"and\" + \"id,\" which, yes, I did just make up for this occasion) I opted for chicken + doughnuts. In fact, I had Korean + Japanese chicken, of which the salty sweetness of the Japanese BBQ paired best with doughnuts. Between the breast + drum, the breast was more tender and meaty. Between cucumber salad + buttered corn, the warm, comforting flavor and texture of the corn won my vote. I also had pb&j + blueberry cacao + lemon gingerbread + maple bacon, but blacked out between the third and fourth doughnut, meaning more R+D is in order.   The Japanese BBQ fried chicken breast paired with buttered corn is my pick as of now, but I genuinely appreciate that Welcome C+D lets me have it all. As long as they supply a deep fryer and a dream, I'll supply cash and jubilant lack of self-control.",

    "text": "This place was an old KFC that they turned into a cute, unassuming establishment that serves not only crispy fried CHICKEN but also crispy fried DONUTS!  For the FOOD I got the one piece korean chili sauced chicken with the corn miso side and the regular cake donut that the combo comes with. I loved the presentation of the chicken when it came out. It was evenly coated in the rich, red chili sauce and it was topped with fresh green onions. The chicken was super crispy and the sauce was a little spicy but too salty for me. I tried my friend's chicken and he got the viet sauce which I liked much better than my chili sauce.  I intended to save my palate by eating the miso corn side but that was surprisingly salty as well. FInally I reached for the cake donut and my taste buds profusely thanked me. Out of everything, the simple cake donut was the winner for me because it had a perfect balance of sweetness with a slightly crispy outer layer and dense chewy innards.   The ATMOSPHERE is very plain. You enter the restaurant and order at the counter. When they call your number you go back to the counter and pick up your food. They also offer water at the counter. FILL UP because you will need it to wash everything down.  I really wanted to love this place because they were successful on so many components in my book like creativity and simplicity; however, my main course was just too salty in general. I would say to stay away from the korean chili sauce and the corn because my friend's Viet chicken and thai slaw were much more balanced.",

Went with the 3 piece combo with Korean Chili sauce. Perfectly spiced juicy chicken that had the perfect amount of heat where you could taste the spice without setting fire to your mouth. The traditional doughnut complimented the chicken perfectly and used it to mop up the extra sauce and washed everything down with a Blue Sky Cola.  This place is now in my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix and will be part of my lunch crew's rotation.",

The Korean BBQ was good, it has a lil kick to it, to me 2 chickens was enough, I couldn't finish 3 fried chickens because it comes with a donut and 1 side. The Vietnamese herb was very delicious, it was my favorite. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The cucumber salad was my favorite side for the Vietnamese herb chicken, it definitely compliments the saltiness of the chicken. Everything was just good and then you add the donut! Heaven!",

I showed up at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and didn't notice a sign on the front door that says they're sold out. Sold out of everything basically. Everything except 3 donuts. The poor girl at the counter said this is been that way all week. My question is why does a business even bother to be open if they run out of food every day, way before closing time. I think the owner of this establishment might want to consider purchasing more material so they can take advantage of the hours they have posted on the door. Perhaps they should have a phone number to call to see if it's even worth their time before they drive all this way.... Hopefully I've beaten this dead horse to death. I will give this establishment another try so that I can improve their rating. Hopefully next time they have more than 3 donuts!  Update... Finally got a chance to see what all the fuss was all about. They were completely wiped out of donuts again but this time there was a couple types left. Enough to make half a dozen. Plenty of chicken though so we got the big meal-whole chicken plate. Selected the popular Korean and Japanese sauces. For the side I picked the vegetable medley which was primarily corn. The corn medley was actually pretty legit. Probably the best portion of the meal. The chicken was moist and tender but it just had no flavor. The dipping sauces were ok but nothing spectacular. The donuts we tried seemed a little dry. Overall, I'd say they serve a average meal.",

Blueberry Cacao I believe, was no lie the WORST donut I've ever had in my life. I threw it away in the restaurant immediately after two bites. Been back since and after two other donut attempts, it's safe to say they don't know what their doing and the beautiful exterior of the product does not match the taste.   Chicken / sides were pretty solid for me on both trips, donuts were a tragedy (seriously how do you mess up donuts?), place smelled like a kimchi  car accident, multiple homeless people be bummin inside the restaurant as well so enjoy getting panhandled why you try and justify your $11+ lunch purchase. Overall honestly just overrated / overpriced. Really wanted to think differently about this joint because of how great the Welcome Diner is but... they should really change the name so it doesn't reflect poorly on their original establishment.",

The location is pretty easy to get to and there is tons of free parking. the restaurant is small but has that old time diner feel.  When we went to order, there was not a single donut in the case. It was fine because I mainly wanted to try the chicken. The employees seemed like they had a long day and were trying to hurry us when there was no one behind us in line.  They were also out of breasts so we ordered the thighs and drumsticks with the vietnamese herb garlic fish sauce. I chose the stir fry side and my husband chose the potatos. For our donut we got hot cake donuts on the side.  We took our seat and the food came out promptly. The chicken was pretty tasty, I liked the sauce and the chicken was overall pretty juicy. my side was not very good, I did not like the stir fry blend and I hated wasting it. My hotcake donut tasted like lemon, so I was disappointed because I figured a hotcake donut would be reminiscent of hotcakes and I'm not a huge fan of lemon.  Overall it was okay, I have had better chicken at other restaurants but it was still better than most places attempt at fried chicken. I would love to try their donuts and see if those are better.",

They came out cold and didn't really taste like much. I'm sure they would have been fine if they were warm but they weren't. Also the donuts in the case looked small and unimpressive for the 2-4 dollars each price tag. And the restaurant had a strong sour smell to it (I know I should've turned around and left when I walked in to the smell but I was hungry and had driven a bit out of my way to get here) so we ended up sitting outside when we ate.

The interior is small but cool, and you order at a counter. They have the case of donuts up front showcasing all of the flavors, as well as all of their menu items up above where you order. The employees have always been very nice and efficient. If you come past 10:30am, then you can enjoy their chicken. I usually get a breast, thigh and drum combo with the Japanese bbq sauce and Thai yum slaw, and I always upgrade my donut to whichever flavor I want to try. It's always fantastic!!  On this particular visit, I arrived before chicken time so I snagged a half dozen. I can't remember the exact flavors, but one involved beer, maple bacon, dark chocolate pudding, and chocolate pistachio among the sprinkled ones I believe. So so SO good. Anytime I drop someone off at the airport I make sure to swing by this place. Highly recommend if you have an adventurous palate or are willing to try something new!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to check this place out for awhile, finally did and the experience was pretty disappointing (mostly for reasons other than the food).  My boyfriend and I got there a few hours before closing (1:30ish maybe?) and I wanted 6 wing combo meal and he wanted a 12 wing combo meal. They didn't have enough wings so we each had to get 6. They were out of every single side but the stir-fry (surprise, the least appetizing one). The doughnut case was nearly empty, only a couple flavors to choose from. I saw they carried coke products so I tried to order a diet coke - they only had regular. Now I get that some places don't carry coke or pepsi products and I can respect that, but if you're selling coke have diet. Way more people drink diet coke than regular.   So then I go to find a table and every single table is filthy. Now if it was super busy in there I could understand but there was only one other person sitting in there at a table. It was dead, there's no reason the tables shouldn't have been clean.   Now on to the food. The wings were actually really good. I was skeptical when I saw they weren't made to order but they were hot, crispy, not too greasy, and the sauce was bomb. They were very tiny though and between my boyfriend and I there was only one drumette, the rest were all tips. The stir-fry (the only side they actually had) was non-memorable, basically just canned corn. The doughnuts were decent, vaguely reminiscent of home-fried doughnuts, but nothing special.  Now to the part that upset me the most. I didn't watch as they were preparing my food but someone came in and ordered as we were leaving and I saw the staff preparing their meal with no gloves! They were just handling the chicken barehanded! Gross! I would have sent my food back had I known before I ate. I probably would have given them 3 stars had it not been for this because the food was decent to good in terms of taste but that is just a huge no no for me.",

First impression, the shop has a modern look to it and its clean.  The wait staff is approachable and friendly.  I wanted donuts only but the chicken looked good.  I saw a lot of it fried and sitting out.  Not sure if they were setting up an order but I could imagine not cooking to order may cause some of the dry meat issues others reported.  The donuts were a novelty... Picture included an Irish Cream (Boston creme style donut), lucky charms, Limon chipotle, strawberry sprinkles, PB and Jelly, and a Irish sprinkes (St. patty day selection).  The donuts were airy for the most part, the chipotle was a cake donut with a good crisp (probably my favorite).  None of them seemed to disappoint.  Value wise I question this though, almost pushing $20... I think the donuts may need a price balance a bit.  If that doesn't sell it, charging $14 for a three piece meal (that may be premade) loses value   Overall, I see why there is positive hype... The pastries are good.  A lot of creativity so I really couldn't see myself voting less than 4 stars.  Worth a second visit when I'm back in town.",

    "text": "I have been planning to write this review for a long time; sorry it took so long! The owners of this place are nice, the aesthetic is country/cozy and the menu is truly unique. They serve organic chicken which is treated naturally, without bleach like most other producers of poultry meats. The breading around the chicken is very light and crisp. I felt like I was cracking open a wafer thin pastry  shell. Inside the chicken is perfectly cooked and moist. Not greasy nor heavy, just cooked right. Each peace is plain so they offer sauces to dip or coat the chicken in. Now the sauces are not ordinary, they're good and NOt syrupy like other places. And when I say the chicken is plain I I do not mean bland nor boring.  It's seasoned and its a very clean taste. Its just chicken and nothing extra as it SHOULD BE and made fresh daily just like the donuts.  The donuts are what I REALLY want to talk about. Oh. My. Goodness. They are like cake but not heavy. They are fluffy but not full of air. It's hard to describe because they are unique. I wonder if there are any like these anywhere else?  The toppings and fillings are made from locally sourced and seasonal ingredients. Keep that in mind when I tell you they have new flavors often. They like to keep variety and nee things show up each time I vist. My first visit, I tried the rose and pistachio which is one of the few they keep long-term due to immense popularity. Next visit I believe I tried a blood orange jelly donut...whatever it was, it made me come back the next time. I tried about 3 more over the span of about 7 months. If you have a limited budget like I do, please visit at least once. If you're someone who eats out frequently or wants a quality breakfast/ lunch please consider going there often. OK now anyone who has tried this and says \"meh\" PLEASE MESSAGE ME and tell me why. I have to know because I see this place as amazing. You'll have to tell me where else you could go to get something better.",

One thing to know up front. Get here early on weekends. THEY RUN OUT OF CHICKEN ROUTINELY ON THE WEEKENDS. When we arrived at 2pm on Saturday they had 6 wings left. No other chicken was available.  They said they only prepare a certain amount each day. WOW. WHAT A BUMMER! I almost left but glad I stayed.   I ordered the 6 wings with Korean bbq sauce. Wow. I will be back for this for sure. Crispy and a great spicy sweet sauce. So, so good   Chicken sandwich. I guess this is not fresh so they had this type of chicken.  It was good., but nothing special. The wings were so much better.   Welcome breakfast sand: awesome.   Sides Seasoned potatoes: not much seasoning. Not that good.   Coleslaw: good, a tad sweet. Needed a little more vinegar.   Doughnuts: the apple fritter was the best we have had in Phoenix. So good.   Lemon maple cake: not that good. Lemon and maple not that great a combo imo.   Service 4/5. Doughnuts 4/5. Chicken 5/5. Overall 4/5.",

    "text": "This is by far the best fried chicken in Phoenix, with super crispy yet light skin, not too much grease, juicy and tender meat at the right hot temperature, and just the right amount of seasoning that obviates the need for any extra sauce, which you will have on hand anyway because the chicken will come with a side of sauce.  I usually stay away from breast and prefer dark meat, but all pieces of the bird were enjoyable and delicious.  You are paying a premium for the meal, so come to the restaurant expecting to pay a little extra, which in my opinion is totally worth it.  6 pieces + sauce = $18.  The chicken wings come in just as crispy and delicious, but they can be over-sauced and a little too heavy when compared to the fried chicken.  The Japanese BBQ and Korean chili flavors were tasty and authentic, and the Vietnamese herb sauce was interesting in a good way.  Again, a little less heavy hand when saucing the wings would've made the dish ideal.  But heavy sauce notwithstanding, biting into the freshly prepared, piping hot, and deliciously crispy wings just confirms that this restaurant knows how to cook up poultry.  12 wings + sauce + slaw + one cake donut = $13.  The cake donut that is served with the combos are plain, unglazed, and obviously of the cake variety, and it's passable, but I prefer the doughy donuts that are displayed at the register, which will set you back at least $2-3 per piece.  They come in a variety of funky and unique flavor combinations, but honestly they are not anything special or a head above the competition, and they don't really add to the chicken meal.  I still prefer the Welcome chicken/donut combo over LoLo's waffle combination, but I wouldn't go out of my way to snag a couple of donuts here.  Each donut is pretty huge, I do have to say.  Still, I think Bosa donuts are better (and waaay cheaper).   One donut = $2-3, 1/2 premium dozen = $16, one premium dozen = $28.  There is plenty of seating inside and outside, the whole place including the bathrooms are clean, there are plenty of napkins to grab if needed, parking is ample, and service is friendly.  I do have to warn you that if you stay inside the restaurant for even just a few minutes, you will walk out smelling like fried oil, but don't let that deter you from checking this place out.",

If you're wanting something a little healthier go with the cucumber salad. If you want veggies that taste like a treat get the side of corn.  I'm torn about the donuts. In my opinion, they're good but not great. I typically like funky flavors but feel like some of the flavors might be a bit too funky for me. Still worth trying though.  I can't wait to try the maple bacon donut, but they're always out by the time we get there. We've been told we've got to get there super early for that one. It must be delish! Dislike... They lady that threw her phone number on the table for my husband when he was there without me. Lol!

We got here about 25min before they started serving chicken. We ordered the maple bacon donut (duh) and the blueberry cream cheese donut. Maple bacon was deeeeelicious. The frosting (especially the blueberry cream cheese) was super sweet, one bite at a time, we barely finished them. The fresh coffee helped wash them down! We ended up waiting until the chicken was being served (ThankGod we did). I don't know where to start or end on this stuff, the outside was fried to perfection without being too greasy, or salty it was seasoned to perfection and fried at the perfect temperature (I really appreciate the love they put into their chickens). Once you get inside, the chicken was so tender and moist it melted in my mouth! We tried both the Japanese bbq and Vietnamese sauce (on the side) they were very good but very strong in flavor I loved the chicken so much I didn't think it needed sauce! This was definitely worth the drive we will be back!",

I didn't think this place would have really good ramen. the donut is pretty good as well. the chicken are flavorful but not overwhelming. the first time I got the chicken was the Korean chicken and that was really good. I thought it was going to be overkill since there was so much sauce on it. but the flavoring wasn't as strong as I thought it would be. the second time I tried the regular fried chicken, it was good until i notice it was a little undercooked. so I just threw it out. the only bad thing about this place is the place smell like oil from all the deep frying, kind of intoxicating. I usually have to eat out side to avoid the deep fried oil fragrance. the service isn't too great as well. the people behind the register can be friendlier, seem like they don't want to be there. At first I was like maybe they were just having a bad day on my first visit. yup, wasn't too fond on my second visit either. the only pleasant customer service I received was from the person who deliver the food.

I was too early for chicken but was able to try seven different donuts and was completely disappointed.  The yeast donuts are dry and taste like bread with simple syrup on top and the cake donuts are lacking in flavor.  I went on a day when they collaborated with another chef, so I even tried some of the fancy donuts but wasn't impressed with any of them.  I wasted $18 on donuts that weren't worth taking a second bite.  I hope their chicken is spectacular enough to warrant such high reviews.  Otherwise if you're after a yummy donut is head to Bosa or another of the smaller chains in town.",

You come here for Asian Inspired Fried Chicken made with organic red bird chicken and really great donuts. You place your order at the counter and first decide on what size and flavor chicken you want, then decide on your Asian Inspired side and lastly your donut. Some donuts are a $1.00 uncharge. You then seat yourself and wait for to hear your number called. A special was offered the day I was there and they were offering ramen in addition to the menu.  I went with the two piece Korean Chili Chicken with tom yum slaw and a key lime donut. The chicken had a nice crisp skin and the interior was juicy. I thought the sauce was tasty. It didn't have that caramel shattering crisp thing I like in Korean Fried Chicken but there is no denying this chicken still was tasty. The slaw was very unusual to me but sort of tasty. I thought the donut was cooked nicely. It was light and puffy and seemed oil free. The Key Lime Donut was really delicious with lots of flavors and textures. I just wish my donut had a little more of the delicious filling as mine was very scant with the filling.  The people working there were helpful and very concerned about how everything was.  Tasty fried chicken and a fun donut is a treat!",

I got a chicken breast with sweet chili sauce and it was off the hook! The skin was crunchy and the sauce was tasty.

Staff was great, nice little dining space. Good work, folks (but leave that fritter batter alone!)",

Finally, you can have one of their several donut flavor combinations that are unexpected but delicious. Excellent customer service and atmosphere (talk to Austin). I'll definitely be coming back!",

My favorite was the Korean chili and the Vietnamese herb ones. I also tried the ramen they offered and I have to say that I was disappointed. It was too oily and there was no taste to it. I think store bought ramen packs taste even better than the ones they served. :/",

It hit all the bullet points: local, creative, quality ingredients, and donuts (duh). ;)   But honestly, I wasn't super impressed. Here's what I know:   *it's tiny-small building, not meant for large crowd *service was so-so, more of 'get ya in, get ya out' attitude  *coffee, price was right ($2 for 16oz.), but they don't have an espresso machine *apple fritter was dry-doughy and large, $3, and had no crispy exterior that usually expect from scratch-made fritters *Apple cider, toffee, celery root donut was gross. I blame myself for ordering that one though (also $3)  So bottom line being, if I'm going to spend $10 on two donuts and drip coffee, I'm probably going to look else-where. Will probably return to try the ramen though.",

There are so many different dipping sauces, all with an Asian twist to it. The DONUTS! So fresh! If your in the area you must stop by for some chicken and a cake donut! There isn't much indoor seating but there is a nice covered patio with misters and large wooden picnic tables.",

Tasted weird, a bad aftertaste that reminded me of spoiled milk. We haven't been able to finish the dozen donuts, after 2 days. I'm going to have to throw it away. Do yourself a favor, buy a dozen of Bosa donuts. Bosa's not the best, but way better. Shoot, even a dozen from Frys is better. You can't see it in the picture that well, but there is a \"puddle\" of grease under each donut that soaks into the cardboard box. Also, the grease can be seen from the sides of the box. WOW! I still can't believe how much grease!!!!! GREASY and GROSS!!!! $18 for this dozen....TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!",

    "text": "I tried Welcome Chicken + Donuts today for the first time with one of my friends. She has been raving about it for a while so I figured today was a good day to go (finals!).   We were greeted by whom I assume is the owner and he was super friendly and helpful. I decided on the chicken breast with the Korean chili sauce, Thai yum slaw, and the original cake donut. I also got a cold brewed coffee with the house-made coconut caramel sauce.  The chicken's flavor was great, but the meat was dry and difficult to cut/bite at. The slaw was a nice addition flavor wise. I ate a bite of chicken, donut, and slaw and it was a great combo! The coffee was so delicious. The taste was a little weird at first, but I got used to it and really like it (kinda like coconut milk). I took off 1 star because of the dry chicken, I wish I was juicier and tender.  When we were leaving the owner (I think) gave us 2 free donuts! A Thai tea and something watermelon. Very interesting flavors...  Overall, the service was impeccable and the food was pretty delicious!",

From yeast to cake donuts, they had your traditional flavors and a few unique toppings and glazes. Unfortunately, I came about 30 minutes before they closed so many of the flavors were already sold out.  My favorite is the traditional maple bar but decided to step out of my comfort zone and try their Lemon Maple cake donut ($2). I wasn't sure if this combination would be appealing but surprisingly it wasn't bad! I've never seen this combination before, so it was an original. The donut wasn't dry which could easily kill the texture and the maple frosting was sweet but not over bearing. 3.5 stars worthy.  The service was extremely friendly and kind. It was obvious they loved working here and making people happy with their food. If I'm in the mood for chicken, I'll definitely come back to try their Korean fried chicken.",

The fried chicken had so much better and was so salty that I ended up throwing away most of it.  Maybe it was a bad batch that they left in a brine too long?  All I could taste was salt which was odd because I ordered the chicken plain.  I unfortunately won't be back here any time soon.",

The flavors are very creative and tasty and perfectly evoke the Southwest, the quality is consistently high, the coffee is solid, and the interior is retro and fresh at the same time.  There is ample parking, and the only challenges are getting here before your favorite donuts are gone and finding a place to sit inside (their spacious patio is another option).  This has become our gold standard of donuts, to which we compare all other donuts. Sad and happy to say, now that we live in Los Angeles I appreciate it even more because we have not found anything even approaching this level of wonderfulness. Miss you, Welcome!",

I was really looking forward to the strawberry glazed sprinkled  but in the end had to settle for the chocolate pistachio. If you have finished paying be sure to leave the register with your donut. I made the mistake of coming up later for my donut and the one I chose got sold to a group that came in after me. Don't get me wrong, the chocolate pistachio was very decadent and delicious--I just really wanted strawberry.  The little hiccup and slowness at the register could've been made up with by the juicy and crispy chicken. In fact, it's been the some of the crispiest ive had in the area.  I went with Japanese barbeque sauce on the side and Nashville hot tossed. The Japanese barbecue sauce was really tasty and I loved dunking my chicken into it with each bite. As for the Nashville hot style, I personally prefer a lot more spice and heat; currently presented it left more to desire.  It sounds like I may have had a bad experience and will definitely be back to give it another shot.",

    "text": "I certainly felt welcome at Welcome Chicken and Donuts! I came for lunch because I had an appointment in the area and did not leave disappointed. I'd done some research beforehand and found that they had a Nashville hot rub that isn't listed on their online menu, so I ordered a 2 PC combo of that with the Thai slaw and an upgraded maple ring donut.  I was given the donut immediately after paying and I couldn't sit more than 5 seconds looking at it without devouring it, so I dug into that first and it was excellent. I'm sure part of it was the hangry glutton inside of me, but that donut was slightly warm, extremely pillowy, and wasn't too sweet while still having tons of flavor. There were a lot of choices in the case still at noon, which I wasn't expecting based on other reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken originally came out with the side of Japanese BBQ sauce that I ordered, but didn't appear to have the Nashville hot seasoning on it. I took a bite of the drumstick anyway and that thing shattered so satisfyingly that for about 20 seconds, I focused only on eating that crispy chicken skin and didn't even think about the seasoning. When I got to the thigh, I ended up asking if they had any extra hot powder that I could use. This is when we found out that my chicken was plain, so the kitchen staff took it back and gave me back a fully sauced and dress box. Although the seasoning wasn't as hot as I wanted it, the flavor was excellent. The chicken skin, as mentioned, was ultra crispy - I think the crispiest I've ever had, and the meat was juicy as well. The side of Thai slaw was refreshing and had that nice peanut taste I was expecting, this was a great complement to the chicken.  I spoke with the staff as I was leaving and asked if they had spice levels for the Nashville hot. They said they didn't, but mentioned that they have Thai chilis they could add to the mix on request next time, so I will definitely take them up on that offer, which I expect will be sooner rather than later. Loved everything about this place and can't wait to come back for more!",

And I'm not kidding you, you seriously could not tell it was GF or Vegan, they were light and fluffy like a doughnut should be. We got the Chocolate Rose Pistachio doughnut, we actually wanted more Rose flavor but it ended up tasting more like a decadent chocolate doughnut. Also the Lemon Poppy Seed, and the Peanut Butter & Jelly Doughnut. I cannot tell you how much I loved the PB&J one. It had the regular glaze on it as to off set and not be overwhelmingly peanut buttery or jelly. Seriously my favorite.   The Chicken was incredible. The sauce was Japanese BBQ and it was mild and tangy. We'd never had a drumstick that was as perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. It is a must have.",

You have to have pretty good timing to get the whole deal.   I wasn't super impressed with the donuts. They were fresh, but they didn't taste as if they were fresh. The apple was pretty good. I just wished there was more apples in it. Chocolate, pistachio and rose was very dark chocolaty. Maple Bacon was okay, but the bacon seemed a bit soggy. The churro was very cinnamon heavy.   Definitely want to come back and do a chicken donuts combo and see if it's any better.",

    "text": "I rode a bike from downtown Phoenix out to Welcome on a Saturday morning. It was so worth the trip (it's an easy ride, almost completely flat and the roads aren't too busy). I arrived right when they started serving chicken for the day, so I wasn't surprised when it took a few minutes for my chicken to be ready.   My meal started with dessert. A donut with chocolate frosting, pistachio crumble, and rose meringue caught my eye. The meringue was a bit too heavy on the rosewater (and I really like rose). Still, the combination of flavors was a great idea. The donut was a good size with a good contrast of crunch on the outside and fluff to the middle. They were sold out of fritters or I would have gotten one of those instead. If the review was donuts alone, it would probably be 4 stars.  Absolutely delicious fried chicken with spicy Korean sauce. Crispy crust (not too thicc), potent sauce, and succulent tender chicken. Every bite was incredible and I wanted so much more after. If you're in Phoenix it's definitely worth a bike ride from downtown.",

    "text": "Amazing little spot in downtown Phoenix just around the corner from Chase Field and Talking Stick Resort Arena.   Austin served us up the most amazing meal, bloody Mary, and hooked us up with his favorite flavor donut so we could try it since it was our first time. He was cool, calm, and collected although there was a line out the door and he went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our meal.   Only gave it 4 stars because the one table that was available was dirty and they ran out of 2 of the 3 things we wanted (wings & pork belly for the ramen). Otherwise, it was well worth the drive from Mesa, we will definitely be back.   The chicken is crunchy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. The sauces are delicious and in my humble opinion, are best on the side - Korean chili being my absolute favorite. The plain donut that comes with your chicken is just the tiniest bit sweet and really goes well with it. Can't wait to enjoy the patio in the cooler months!",

We got one with the spicy korean sauce, and another one with the japanese bbq sauce. The bbq sauce was too sweet for me, and I preferred the korean sauce much more. Otherwise it was a solid sandwich, and the sides (thai slaw and potatoes) were both tasty but not super memorable.  I am also a pretty big fan of donuts, and was excited to try their donut flavors. The standard glazed donut was solid but the texture could be slightly better. The chocolate rose was fun (there are tiny rose meringues on top!), but the apple fritter was probably my favorite out of the 3 we tried.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch with some friends. I have had this place bookmarked for a long time so I was rather excited when we decided on this place.   You can order donuts or chicken individually but I would recommend getting a combo so you can get the best of both worlds and get a side. I ordered the breast combo and paid extra to upgrade my donut to one of the fancier donuts. One of my friends didn't want her plain donut that came with her meal so I also got her plain donut too. For the chicken, I chose the Korean chili sauce and for the breast to be tossed in the sauce. For the donut, I upgraded to the maple bacon donut. For my side, I chose the Thai yum slaw.  They give you the donut immediately out of the case at the counter. I started eating my donut before the chicken came out because it obviously was not going to go with the chicken at all. The maple bacon donut was so good. The donut itself was so soft and fluffy. The bacon was cooked nicely. The bacon was cooked well for a donut topping. I love maple bacon donuts and this one is definitely one of the better ones I have had. I also started on the plain cake donut that my friend gave me before my chicken came out. It was more dense than a regular donut. It was also a lot less sweet. I can see it going with the chicken in a chicken and waffles kinda way. I would never just order this plain donut though for any reason than to eat it with the chicken but even then why do that when there are so many other better sounding and probably better tasting donuts in the case?   When the chicken came out, it was super hot and the skin was super crispy, even though it was covered in the Korean chili sauce. I wish I had ordered the sauce on the side though. I found it a little too salty for me. It had a nice heat to it though and had good flavor... other than the saltiness. The Thai slaw came in a little cup next to the chicken in the basket. The slaw was fresh and tasted pretty good. It had a lighter flavor and really helped balance out the saltiness of the Korean chili sauce on the chicken. The chicken breast piece I had wasn't juicy but it wasn't dry either. I didn't mind the piece I received at all.   I would definitely like to come back and get more donuts and try different things on the menu.",

Having grown up sample a fair share of donuts as a family I am well versed in the decadence of donuts.  The great part about the donuts here is the combination of classic donuts like the apple fritter and cake donut but you can also try some of the most unique creations that they offer like key lime and lemon poppyseed to name a couple.   What goes better with a donut than coffee.  And the coffee does not fail.  There aren't many place around town that offer a cold brew and theirs is dynamite. I love that they offer almond milk as an option.  The chicken is spot on.  Just the right amount of crispness and so juicy.  Everyone that works there has been friendly and welcoming.

    "text": "I have heard a lot of great things about the donuts. About a month ago I was finally nearby and decided to stop in since it was still early. It was close to noon and only a few people were in line. We debated on ordering chicken, but after seeing it just sitting out at room temperature, partially fried, on the speed cart, made it very unappealing. The donut case was full, but I was disappointed by the choices, I was hoping for at least one filled doughnut option. We ordered half a dozen and it was $15 with the tip I left. The service was friendly and fast. However, once we got home we were very disappointed by the donuts. The raised donuts didn't seem very fresh and had a very greasy taste. I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor from the Maple glazed. The salted blueberry lemon had a very greasy taste to it, the glaze was good. The chocolate pistachio rose had a decent flavor, but the donut was dry. The apple fritter was very dry and had a greasy after taste. It also lacked apple, mine had 4 tiny pieces. The sprinkle cake donut was the best flavor and freshness wise, until I got to the middle, it wasn't even cooked, completely raw in the middle. The classic chocolate was the same exact way. We ended up not even finishing one donut. So after spending $15 on half a dozen of donuts, I was extremely disappointed. I really feel I wasted my money. I excepted a lot more especially based on all the rave reviews. One star is for the friendly service I received, but based on the donuts and the holding of food standards, I cannot rate any higher.",

Our 1st choice was Carolinas, which was right down the street, but they were closed.  (Can never go wrong with food from Carolinas)..I called ahead just to make sure that they were open. A woman answered, said \"Please hold!\" What I didn't know was that she meant for ME to continue to hold because she was not coming back to the phone.  I kept holding and holding, when we arrived, we waited for about 6 minutes..When the gentleman ask for our order, I jokingly stated that I am still holding and waiting on the phone (09:45 minutes later)..he looked down at their phone, saw that a call was holding (yeah, that was me), he hung up the phone and sarcastically said, \"Well, you're here now, what is your order?\"  It goes without saying that I refused to place an order, but my friend did place 2 orders. As I looked around the place, there was this huge bucket in the middle of the floor because the ceiling was leaking (not very appealing if one is trying to enjoy a meal).  I will not ever visit this place again...Not sure how the food taste, but if it is a reflection on how a 1st time Customer was treated....then it must not be prepared very well.",

    "text": "Ok.....had to check out chicken and donut place. The donuts by themselves are rated at five stars. Good assortment of eclectic donuts. Kinda of pricey though, but you get what you pay for.  As for the chicken choices, this is my opinion. 1. had the three piece chicken choice. Had the Korean chili sauce. Though it would be hot since it did say \"chili\", it was not. I believe the sauce was in such a quantity it overwhelmed the chicken.  2. The Thai slaw was ok. 3. I returned again in a couple days to have another taste. I ordered the \"naked\" chicken this time to get a sense of the chicken by itself. The chicken was indeed moist and tender as described by other reviews. However the chicken was devoid of any seasoning or flavor. I will assume this is so as to interfere with the sauces when incorporated. Maybe the sauces when in use need to be dialed back in quantity. 4. on this visit I had the cucumber side. If I am not mistaken it was zucchini and not cucumber. The zucchini was bitter in my opinion. If it really had cucumber it would have been a successful side. 5. The donut as side in the combo, it maybe novel, but I had a hard time deciding whether to finish the plain cake donut or not. I know a biscuit may be an old school accompaniment, but...................................  I wish them success, the above is only an opinion.",

When she was flirting with the guy in front of me. He walked away she looked at me and her face dropped, her tone turned monotone. It was weird! Um, yeah, it was like she knew me (never met her), and did not like me. Their \"almost always\" in stock donuts as advertised on their website, were almost all gone (one of the kinds listed on their site was there). She had a full rack of donuts behind her, that had to have been reserved for special orders (right?), because she told me all she had was what was in the cases. I regretfully bought a donut. Meh, it was not worth the hype, and in retrospect considering how off putting this woman was, I wish I'd just walked out without getting anything. I was summarily dismissed when she flipped the pay pad around for me to select a tip amount (yeeeeah, no) and turned to the next person in line. Few things are worth being treated with such disdain, a four dollar donut is not one of them. They should take \"welcome\" out of their name, because I felt anything but.",

    "text": "LAAAAAAAHVVV EEEET!!!   The chicken was so good!! It was moist and juicy. They didn't overfry it or made it where it's raw on the inside. PERFECTION. Perfect breading. Perfect seasoning. Perfect crunch! Ah so good! And the Korean chili sauce definitely grew on me as I kept eating.   The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is the the actual hot cake donut that came with the chicken was a bit dry. If you have had Chinese donuts, it has the same consistency minus the sugar. It was just a plain donut. Also the portions was kinda small for the price. It satisfied me but I wasn't completely full. I'll probably get the bigger combo next time I come.   However, the flavored donut that I got on the side was quite big and good. Was is the best donut? No. But it's a memorable donut. There wasn't that many of a variety in comparison to the bigger donut shops but it's too be expected of such a small place.   SERVICE was super friendly and helpful for someone who is new to the menu. Such a cute place and atmosphere! Will be returning soon!",

The combination of a maple glazed donut with an egg and sausage is so DELICIOUS!! The fried chicken also comes with different sauces for dipping which I passed on.

    "text": "Well, today (11/5/2017) at about 1:00pm, we went to this place with about a collective 25 people at the suggestion of someone. Some people invited different people, word spread, it wasn't planned. We didn't even know everyone we just happen to sit at the same tables (because its two very large tables and a lot of people). We are just a friendly bunch. This will be important later.  I want to give this restaurant a five-star review because the food was good and the seating was great. But, I have to give this restaurant a 2 star review because of the lousy customer service of one guy.  We had never been to this place before and my husband asked the guy at the register questions about the food and he didn't answer any of them. (What the?) Which would have been helpful since we were going to buy a few peoples meals. Needless to say it wasn't enough food and he needed to go back and order more.  When the food was brought to the table, this very sweet lady, my husband ordered for, asked very nicely, \"What is this one?\" The guy was like, \"Whatever you ordered.\" Very blunt and rude. For crying out loud I think you know what the food looks like if you work there. If you don't know just say so you big jerk. \"Well, ma'am I'm not sure.\" Would have been a better response. She made the mistake of asking again when some more food was brought out. He said again. \"It's whatever you ordered. I'm just here to bring you the food.\" Yeah, we get it.  He comes out one more time to pick up some trays and scolds us for coming! He's like, \"If you come again, call ahead.\" This wasn't said in a nice tone mind you. My husband was like, \"That's not happening.\" Another guy was like \"Money's green.\" I'm just thinking my husband doesn't even know the guy next to him.  It was 3 pieces of chicken for $12 a plate. My husband dropped A LOT of money at this place, no one deserves to be treated that way. You wont be seeing us again.  Employees like that drive paying customers away. I hope someone important see's this and scolds that dude. If I knew his name I would drop it. The guy obviously doesn't want to work for his paycheck.",

Now that I'm thinking about it- I probably should've tipped more. Smh. Sorry. Lol! But I digress...   THE CHICKEN !!! AMAZING!!! No, I'm serious... I am not one of those Yelpers who totally inflate a place, and in turn, let the rest of us down... This is some of THE BEST CHICKEN that I have ever tasted in my life (And I've tasted many a gospel bird)! Crispy flavorful batter on the outside... Moist, juicy, and fully cooked on the inside. I'm drooling right now!! Plus, they grace you with this fluffy cake doughnut that is rich vanilla with hints of lemon on the palette. It's truly a thing of beauty. The Asian fusion sauce selection really sets off the chicken, too. If you don't mind a little kick... try the Korean Chili - you won't be disappointed. We rounded out our meal with the stir fry, and cold brew coffee w/sweet cream...  The perfect Sunday afternoon lunch.  This was the start of a beautiful friendship... I see myself coming back again and again... And I know they'll Welcome me kindly.",

The second time, I tried the blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate cacao. Both were insanely good, even better than the salted caramel. The chocolate cacao had dense white cake donut with dark chocolate icing... so good. The cheesecake blueberry was also delicious... a little savory, a little sweet, and all tasty. I will certainly be back to try more donuts and try the chicken!",

My boyfriend ordered the 2 piece with the Spicy Korean Sauce, corn, and a maple bacon donut. I liked my sauce better, but his side of corn was bomb. The batter that they use on the chicken was light and crispy and the chicken was cooked perfectly, not all dry. I really wanted chicken wings, but they were sold out. The next time we go, it will be before 11 am so I can get chicken wings.  I wish it was open past 3pm :( so I could enjoy this deliciousness more days of the week than Saturday.",

Nonetheless we ordered the whole chicken combo, all three sauces and all three sides. Had to order extra donuts since combo only came with one. Donut seemed to be the best thing here. We returned one bloody half-cooked chicken thigh - and got a strange explanation from the lady who took the order about it being the bone marrow. Never had that while eating a fried chicken before. The lady did bring us another piece. Overall experience was not memorable or special in any way. Won't be returning.",

I really wanted to love this place based on all the reviews and the staff as well, but the donuts, while creative in idea just didn't wow me, but we're way better than average. I tried the following; chocolate pudding with red wine and Pinot noir salt, pistachio rose and chocolate, chocolate almond coconut, cardamom, maple ring.  The best was the maple ring-also the simplest. Great maple flavor and glaze.  The chocolate pudding was innovative but I just didn't love the overall combo- however the salt finish was great.  The cardamom was ok.  The chocolate coconut almond was also ok - high hopes but it didn't wow me.  The pistachio rose and chocolate was actually a very good combo but the rose was a lil too strong.  Great service overall and a cool place to try when by the airport.  I will definitely try them again and also try the chicken.",

Only knock is maybe one mainstream sauce, like honey bbq, would be nice for us less adventurous types. We all enjoyed the miso corn. 1 kid said it was his favorite thing he ate there. Even the plain donuts are awsome! Plump, moist chicken with crisp skin. Everything prepared to perfection. Super nice staff. Arrived at 2:30 pm and they had run out of many selections. Will arrive much earlier next time.",

Let's start with this donut (and for the life of me I do know the EXACT name) called yuji & macha pistachio donut....it was sweet, tangy, and had a citrus aftertaste. After eating it in 3 bites, I regretted not getting a box of this tantalizing treat. Next, I tried the maple glaze donut- oh so ooey & gooey and the maple taste just stands out. My next favorite was the apple fritter- the pastry was so sweet and just perfect texture and then you got hit with delicious mouthwatering  apples in the middle. Perfection confections.  That's not all, in addition to donuts, they have croissants &, yes, fried chicken. Good heavens. If I knew exactly when I'd die, this is the spot!  Can't wait to try their  blackberry passion fruit donut & keylime pie next! Fork please!",

If you want something sweeter do the BBQ. Only thing that sucks is the seating. I usually get there and have luck with booths, sometimes I'm outside. I wouldn't let that ever be a reason not to come!

The chicken was a different caliber of quality (very good) and it was fried amazingly. When youre eating this chicken, you realize you are not in KFC. However, the sauce was pretty close to what Koreans do. All in all, amazing place to try and so glad PHX is moving on up like the Jeffersons in the cultural food scene.",

Not knowing what to expect, I was thinking chicken and donuts would be a take on chicken and waffles -- the flavors and quality of the food were insanely better! This is a place that FOODIES WILL LOVE! (We certainly did!) Don't go here if you are expecting KFC, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts-type fare. This is not a fast food joint and if that's what you like to eat then you certainly will not be able to appreciate the complexity of delicious flavors this place has to offer.   The chicken is local, fresh, not full of hormones, and unbleached! Incredibly rare to find eating out! The flavors were incredible -- I liked the Korean Chili the best. The sides to go along with the fried chicken are unique and delicious! And the cake donut on the side was surprisingly-perfect with the food! We even got toddy (cold-brewed coffee) that was tasty and cheap and learned it is locally brewed in Phoenix too!   I'm really excited to try some of the gourmet flavors of donuts that they offer. They look like something out of cupcake bakery that you would find in San Francisco - not something typical for Phoenix at all. This place has no snottie vibe either! Just real people creating epic food with epic quality!  We'll be bringing my mother-in-law along next time for sure! This place really does have something to offer everyone!",

I would rank these donuts higher than Dunkin or a supermarket bakery, but I don't think they come close to the taste and texture of lots of other small shops. Maybe it's due to the non-GMO organics stuff, or the recipe, I don't know.  And the cheapest \"standard\" donut is $1.75. A dozen is $17. Specialty donuts are even more. I cannot regularly buy donuts at these prices.  As for the chicken, it's pretty good. The sauces and sides are really good though! One complaint is that I could not find a la cart prices for just a piece of chicken.   I will probably be back to try the ramen, which they seem to have on weekends, but it is $14, which is more than ramen costs in established ramen restaurants in big cities, so my expectations are high.",

Instead of getting mad about my yelp review, he reached out to make things right.  Giving it 5 stars for trying hard to keep my business and will definitely return for the donuts.",

    "text": "I am a fanboy of The Welcome Diner, and am so impressed with this new restaurant! The apple fritter had homemade Cajeta (a Mexican Caramel) with small specks of seasalt. I took a bite and found chunks of real fresh apple! Now that's some homemade love and quality!  I also tried the key lime filled donut and the chocolate mole as well. All excellent and lovingly made.  The fried chicken was incredible. I had the smaller combo with a leg and thigh and the cucumber/dill/ginger side. The chicken has a great consistency, the skin is flaky and crunchy and the inside had none of that fatty texture you find in lower quality chicken places. I had the Korean Chile sauce and I would say it was more flavorful than spicy, but I really enjoyed it. I cleaned off the bones!  The ambiance is clean and laid back. I like the art and their clever clean cardboard menus above where you order. They have a great outdoor seating area with long wooden benches, and cared enough to plant new trees all along the front. It's going to be gorgeous in the next couple of years.   Thank you Welcome Chicken and Donuts!",

Tight indoor quarters with seating for 20 and a beautiful outdoor space with seating for an additional 50.   This place is absolutely fantastic. They were serving ten different donuts; I had the Maple Bacon donut which was a harmonious combination of sweet and salty. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had; and for those seeking a delicious cruelty-free meal, their chicken is humane, never frozen, antibiotic free, free range chicken.  The sides offered that day included a Thai Slaw that was sweet and tangy and went perfect with the chicken. I ordered an iced coffee that was dispensed through a tap and given condensed milk and sugar syrup as fixings; truly the greatest way to enhance any iced coffee in Vietnamese fashion.   The service was exemplary; received food in less than ten minutes. Everything was prepared with class and simplicity combining high quality ingredients on a made-to-order basis. Would go back every week if this were my home town and state. This is a Phoenix gem and should be greatly appreciated by the locals; although there seems to be plenty of support for this amazingly creative and expressive establishment already.   Keep up the great work!",

I made this happen and took a little trip over near the airport to check out Welcome Chicken & Donuts to get me some, well... chicken and donuts.  The restaurant is super tiny and has a very strange vibe.  The selection wasn't that great and I felt like the donuts were overwhelmingly savory.  Maybe it was the day or maybe that was just what was left over but there were not very many sweet choices.  I had a cookies and creme one and another that I don't recall and both where average/good.  The chicken was average/good as well.  kinda of strange that the chicken options all were Asian.",

We always wait to go till after 10:30am so we can also get their amazing chicken. We tend to get 3 donuts and a chicken combo for the two of us and split everything. They always have a wide variety of delicious looking donuts and it is so hard to decide which ones we are going to get. With the chicken, it is just superb, and so far we have only tried their Korean chili. We tried it the first time and it was so amazing that we wanted it again! Next time we will have to try one of the other sauces that I am sure are just as delicious. They have quite a few booths inside that always clear up by the time you order and get your drinks and donuts. They also have great outdoor seating. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Oh, and their coffee is delicious as well (both the hot and cold brew)!",

The Vietnamese sauce was just covering the chicken and was quite salty. Beside getting those glorious chicken, I also treat myself with their coldbrew coffee. O M G.. They are the bomb! (Period).

What made the chicken taste good was the sauce (Japanese BBQ). The cucumbers were in a very small container and tasted very much like vinegar (again was only able to eat by dipping it in the Japanese BBQ sauce). The donut was the best part of the whole meal, very big and very delicious but also overpriced. The whole meal was overpriced if you ask me. All in all I would go back for just a donut if I had an extreme craving. I was a little disappointed and definitely expected more from reading previous reviews.",

There are no competitors around. Everyone wants a place to eat from conveniently when they work the swing shift/night shift.

They said that's the way they cooked the chicken.  I would rather have it made to order but if this is the norm here then I'm sorry but that is not how I do chicken.   Anyway, regarding the chicken it was rather dried out from the double cooking and a bit too heavy on the salt.  The pieces were small too.  It's too bad because based on the reviews I was really hoping this would be the go to place but I'll pass.  Not even the donuts, of which there are not a lot of choices, would draw me back.  The sauces were nothing to rave about either.  Thanks Michael for your response, I've heard of the Korean style but what I thought I heard was the chicken they were frying was from the day before, if that is not the case my bad.  Anyway, the second frying seems to make the skin batter too hard and for me personally it still had too  much salt.  As for the donuts, they were a bit hard too, didn't really have that melt in your mouth feel.  Good luck with the business, thanks again for the reply.",

    "text": "Being a cookie kind of girl and skeptical in general of \"Best Of\" food lists I smiled and thanked politely when tons of people talked and wrote about this place. I silently smiled when my friends asked, \"Have you been to WCAD?\" \"Not yet\" was my polite response. I was really thinking, \"Ummm, no, and I never will.\" I peacefully read article after article and Best Of lists that hailed their almighty Key Lime Donut. Nope, not going unless they have cookies. I silently doubted all the claims. However, when my Foodie friends starting talking I sat up and took notice. I jotted it down on my Spring Break, local Staycation food tour list.   Cookie monster was busy today so I dragged my rear out of bed on the second day of Spring break and drove the 15 miles or so to get there. Okay, I had errands in the area. You'll never know, wink! I might or might not drive many miles for good food in Az. I'm not telling.    Well, forget the donuts. Let me tell you, the one piece Chicken breast combo with Thai Slaw and sauce number 1 was freaking, seriously delish!  Holy Heck, (chicken)  in a hand ( cardboard) basket! Get that, okay?  \"The donuts?\" you ask, \"How were the donuts?\" Well here is how that went. I bought a half dozen of the upgraded donuts. I got their signature Key Lime Pie one of course. I wanted to try the Irish Bomber and Chocolate Almond one but they were sold out. Insert sad face. Happy face come back.  The very lovely lady behind the counter threw in a red wine covered something or another as a recommendation, and I ordered a chocolate and an Arnold Palmer Thai Lemonade to boot.  They cost me a weeks paycheck though. Seriously $12.50 for 6 donuts, ouch! I spent my entire spring break food allowance. Sigh! After all was said and done I might or might not be a donut convert, just saying. Sorry Cookie Monster I have a new BFF!  But here is the interesting part I honestly thought just the plain cake donut they gave free with the meal was way better than the upgraded donuts. It tasted better and was free with a meal. You can tell the quality of the donut without all the goodies and stuff on on it. So surprisingly I liked the food here better than the desserts.   By the way, they have one of the best cups of coffee I have had in Phoenix. Just a regular Joe please. So hard to find in Phoenix.  Finally, the staff members are super nice too. And those errands you ask?  Well, never happened because now that it is 90 degrees in March I couldn't let the leftovers spoil, now could I?",

    "text": "When we heard that Crepe Bar, one of our favorite go-to spots, was collaborating with Welcome Chicken + Donuts, it seemed like a complete no brainer to check it out. On that rainy morning, it was fairly busy at this small hole-in-the-wall restaurant but they were doing well to get through patrons quickly. There were very few tables to sit inside but a little bit more space outside.  For my meal I chose the 2 piece chicken in Korean Chili sauce with Corn + Miso Butter Stir Fry and cake donut; my date got the 3 piece chicken in Vietnamese + Fresh Herbs sauce with Ginger Scallion Cucumber Salad and upgraded to the Blueberry Cacao donut. The Korean Chili sauce was so delicious. The best way to describe it would be like an orange-y sweet and sour sauce with a bit of a kick to it. More impressive than that was the corn stir fry. It was buttery and had so much flavor; unfortunately, the donut left much to desire. It was boring & kind of didn't belong. At first, I thought that maybe it was because it wasn't one of the special ones but my date wasn't very impressed with his either. I tried a bite of the Vietnamese chicken & thought it was incredibly salty & the cucumber salad was okay but I didn't like that it was cold.  Next time, I'd probably just order the chicken wings in Korean Chili sauce. I would be willing to try one of the other donuts as well ... Hopefully for a better experience.",

    "text": "Who is the genius behind Welcome? Were they inspired by late night drunchies, pregnant women or are they just THAT clever? Regardless, Welcome C+D ... thank you. Chicken x Donuts x Coffee = a finger-lickin', sweet and head-clearing morning well spent ... mind you I'm still talking about Welcome.  They serve up classic cake/raised donuts and fritters as well as their eccentric, yet surprisingly well thought out gourmet flavored ones as well. I was eyeing the Cherry Amaretto, Peanut Butter/Jam, Maple Bacon and their special which happened to be their fritter flavored with Miso Butterscotch and topped with chicharrones.   I went with the Maple Bacon, wasn't feeling adventurous enough. I also ordered 1/2 dozen of wings with the Thai Chili sauce since most people seem to have had their hands on them in the shop. To drink I went with their Blue House cold brew- it ain't no Blue Bottle but it'll do.  The Maple Bacon Donut was fluffy, soft and fresh. The icing was just perfect, good maple flavor and I appreciated the chopped bacon crumb on top. The bacon itself wasn't overly salty nor smoky. A great contrast of salty and sweet, a 2-in-1 kinda breakfast.  The wings themselves were okay, the coating was crisp and not too thick. The only problem I had with the wings were that they weren't split so it was a bit difficult to eat. I should've took some tips from fellow Yelpers which advised to get sauce on the side. The sauce itself was okay, needs a little more sweetness to balance out the tangy/savory flavor and tbh overwhelmed the flavor of the well-cooked chicken.  The interior is fun, has a diner x donut shop x retro vibe to it. The staff is friendly AF, willing to give reccs and easy on the eyes. Male cashier wearing the plaid- here's looking at you, kid.  With WC+D being \"Hot & New\" like that new student who joined your Math class in high school, you have to check it out - you know AT LEAST once.",

My wife really liked the Mango donut.  My son liked the Chocolate Strawbery Bread Pudding donut.  My daughter's favorite was the Cookies and Cream.  The Apple Fritter was the best Apple Fritter I've ever tried, but...my fave?  The maple bacon.  WOW!!!  As good as it sounds :-)  The plain cake donut that comes with the chicken combo is still very tasty (with a hint of citrus).  First time:  Tried the leg and thigh combo with the Korean spicy sauce, the corn stir fry as the side, and the plain donut.  Chicken was very moist, very crisp, delicious.  Sauce is very messy, but tasty!  I was a little ambivalent about the corn stir fry - too salty.  The plain donut was extremely fresh, and had a faint citrus note.  Yum!  Also tried the local (Blue Moon, or something like that?) Root Beer - pretty good.  Cool local place.  Music was too loud, and the benches were too high/too close to the table.  (There was a patio area - maybe eat there next time?)  Bottom line, come for the food, you won't be disappointed!!",

Everything at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is made fresh on the premises daily.   Welcome Chicken + Donuts has the most  amazing flavored donuts.  The dounuts are truly inventive with flavors like espresso, maple bacon, PB&J, creme brulee, the list goes on and on. These donuts are a must try.  On my first visit I choose one of my favorite flavor combinations, Cream Cheese and Blue Berry.  My lunch companion choose the Apple Fritter and Wisconsin Cheese. The donuts were light, pillowy, and glazed with a wonderfully light sweet topping.  Now let's talk chicken.  All I can say is the chicken at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is delicious.  The chicken has  a crispy well-seasoned skin, and juicy tender meat, just like chicken should be.  Welcome Chicken + Donuts use a unique blend of varuous spices to give a world flavor to their chicken.  You can choose to have chicken seasoned with a dry rub or wet, both are delicious.   Together or separately - the chicken and donuts all winners.  I definitely recommend Welcome Chicken + Donuts.",

Staff (1 I dealt with) was very friendly and informative. As a newbie, I asked for suggestions and settled for the BBQ chicken breast and three donuts (maple plus bacon, passion fruit, and something sesame) for the road. Chicken and sauce were good but not super. Same can be said for the donuts. Passion and sesame were just okay but the maple and bacon were super tasty. I overall left a little dissatisfied given how high my hopes were. I want and will give the place another try as I want to try another donut and their ramen. For now, I will stick with Sunrise Donuts.",

Some items you couldn't taste too much of the flavor (ex: maple lemon) - it just tasted like sugar - or others it was almost overwhelming (ex: raspberry vanilla and rum mojito are both pretty tart). Also, the red wine chocolate pudding one...does not contain a lot of pudding as an FYI.   I'm not sure if I would come back. Maybe you need to get the chicken and donut to get the whole experience, but the donut should stand on it's own too right? And hmm, I wasn't sold.",

    "text": "Welcome Chicken + Donuts sounds like the whole name is a full sentence.   DONUT: Strawberry Cheesecake AND the Passion Fruit. The strawberry cheesecake is better than the passion fruit for sure. I must say, when getting donuts here, go with the filled ones. The filling is to die for in most of those donuts, but I found the passion fruit to be a little lack luster. Maybe I was hoping for a more intense passion fruit flavor, but overall, the donuts are fried to perfection and the right amount of sugar is added. The donuts definitely stick to your sides, so even after sharing half and half of both donuts, it being one full donut, damn, it's a lot of donut.   CHICKEN: Thigh and Wing with Japanese Sesame Sauce + Watermelon Fennel Salad. The chicken itself was fried very well. I must say that the thigh and wing were fried to the right crispy level. The Japanese sesame sauce though was a little too sweet for me. I wish I had gotten another sauce looking back on it, but they offer other sauces (Vietnamese and Korean inspired sauces). The watermelon fennel salad definitely cuts into the heaviness of the meat and the donut (that you may have already eaten because I know I did) and is mighty tasty.    SERVICE: The friendly Arizona vibes are strong here!   Chicken and waffles, move on over, and let Chicken and Donuts take over. Come here definitely around brunch-ish time if you are making a weekend appearance because this place closes at 4:00 and I have heard if they run out of food, they close the doors earlier. I would definitely visit this wonderful establishment again in Phoenix!",

Then they've got this crazy epic sandwich menu, cake donut for bread with insane goodness inside.   And it gets better: the place flips into a cocktail and beer spot where you could easily get lunch and a brew. Amazing.   Will definitely 1) be back and 2) recommend people go here when they visit Phoenix. It's not even a half mile from the airport.",

It is really great, but really small so I suggest getting two if you're hungry. I would also get a donut while you wait because it takes a bit of time to get your food.

    "text": "Items Selected: Thigh + Drum Combo with Hot Cake Donut, Korean Chili Sauce and Thai Yum Slaw Apple Fritter Basic Glaze Blackberry Pear Apple Butter Hot Buttered Rum Cranberry Hibiscus Mexican Chocolate Snickerdoodle  Missed due to a New Year closure in early 2016, and thus scheduled as a between-meal stop exactly 365-days later, Welcome Chicken + Donuts confirmed rumors of fried-bird greatness prior to the 2016 Fiesta Bowl while the glazed rounds of Dough were a more mixed experience.  Owned by the same folks behind Phoenix's Welcome Diner, their Southern-style Chicken Sandwich frequently cited as one of The Valley's \"must have\" bites, Welcome Chicken + Donuts sees the team take on a double-fried style akin to Korean Chicken at an East Buckeye Road storefront close enough to the city to be accessible, though those unfamiliar with area may see the building surrounded by barren dirt somewhat out of the way.  Bringing a farm-to-table artisan's touch to comfort food, purveyors such as Red Bird Farms and McClendon's both justifying prices higher than KFC or Dunkin', those entering WC+D after 10:30 Tuesday through Sunday are greeted by the faint smell of oil as well as sweet and savory cooking spices, the Donut case hopefully still stocked from the store's 8am opening.  Undoubtedly another former eatery, the counter-style ordering seeing Donuts boxed or placed in baskets prior to a brief wait at one of several booths, diners are given a choice of several dark or light Meat combos plus Ramen, Sides and daily specials, the choice of just one Thigh and a Drumstick with Sauce on the side showing evidence of a long brine and good spice mix beneath golden Batter while the Thai Yum Slaw brightened shredded Cabbage with Carrots and fragrant Peanut Sauce.  With both fellow-diners completely in love with the fried Bird, requests for more quelled by the reminder of two full-meals to come, Welcome's raised Donuts unfortunately failed to achieve the same high marks thanks to a dense, wheaty base that unfortunately comes across doughy unless filled with Fruit Compote while Cake choices trend only slightly better, the Hot Buttered Rum almost textured like a Buttermilk Bar with restrained sweetness to smooth Frosting overlying the ring below it.",

I was skeptical about this fried chicken and donut combination; who has ever heard of such a thing.  I followed my friend's recommendation with blind faith and was rewarded with the best meal of my entire trip to Arizona.    We were fortunate to not have to wait in line when we stopped by for a bite.  After we ordered and sat down at a table, we realized how lucky we got because a long line soon formed in front of the register.    Our food arrived promptly and was followed by a long silence as the three of us stuffed our faces with the delicious food.  I got the thigh and drumstick combo with Korean sauce and the cake donut.  The sauce had more of a kick to it than I was expecting but it was still manageable and tasty.  My friend got the same combo but with the Vietnamese sauce. I regretted not ordering the same sauce because it was so damn delicious! It had a great balance of sweet and salty! Since it was Friday, we were all able to order the seasoned potatoes as sides and we were the happiest campers.  They were like homestyle fries and perfectly seasoned.  We ate everything and I only wish I had more room in my stomach to order more donuts!   I will dream of this place until I return to Arizona.",

I'll eat at most 1/4 of a krispy kreme. I ate a whole donut here. It was that good. I had the lemon maple and it was superb. A little doughier than a normal donut but entirely infused with lemon and maple flavoring while staying light in your mouth. My friend had the maple bacon donut which he said was the best donut he's had in his life and I believe him. You pretty much cannot go wrong with any of their donuts.   Everything else: I'm a big fried chicken fan and I'll be honest this place did not do it for me. I felt like their frying process wasn't crisp enough. The added sauce they put on top makes to whole affair a little too salty for my tastes.  I tried the ramen as well here and it was a pretty lackluster event.   The one thing I didn't get to try were their potatoes which people have been raving about, try to get here early for those, I hear they're top notch. The staff here were incredibly nice as well, they apparently messed up our wing order so gave us an extra 6 wings which my friend happily devoured.   Overally this place is good, but when half your namesake is meh, I can't rate it higher unfortunately, even if the other half makes a non(sugar)believer like me convert.",

Also if you want to try the combo of chicken and donuts come after 10:30 am when the chicken is available.     My friends and I tried 3 donuts, moscow mule, maple bacon and sweet corn and rosemary.   Our favorite was the sweet corn, but the others are good too.   All the donuts are flavorful and soft.  Although all the donuts looked delicious ... I wish we can sample them all !!!   Next ... add chicken.  You can choose various combos and sides. Chicken wings are not on the menu, but also an option and what I would definitely recommend.  They didn't take long to make and super crispy, just how I like my wings.  We wanted to try the sauces so we got the wings plain with sauce on the side.  Now that I'm reviewing I realize there were only Asian sauces available : Korean chili, Vietnamese fresh herb, and Japanese BBQ.  All the sauces were a little too salty for me, but if I had to pick one I would choose plain with the Vietnamese fresh herb (which was basically fish sauce)   The guys that work there are super friendly and will answer all your questions.    If you just wanted a light snack or to start your day with breakfast here, I would definitely check this place out.",

I ended up getting the chicken sandwich with a side and donut. I appreciate all they are trying to do especially with their ingredients but I don't think it was worth the price and time we had to wait. On top of that we waited extra to get our donuts and the girl forgot about us. Cute place but I don't think I will be coming back.",

I'm sorry to report that the most recent time I went the donuts tasted stale. I eat alot of donuts so I know day olds when I taste them. I went at 11:30am so im guessing the stale taste wasnt from being in the display all day. Between 2 chicken lunches and half dozen donuts the bill was $35. For that price the donuts have to be fresh.   The service wasn't anything to write home about either. The counter person was rushing me to decide on which donuts i wanted in my half dozen. I hope this place hasn't started to fall off with their quality that would be a shame.",

Their claim to being a \"cheerful space\" is a joke, as their employees deliberately bully the customers.

All was good but maybe not so much worth to get there walking 3km from the downtown. And in the end it's unhealthy food.  Curious for their Raman.  I liked also their patio.",

Brought my Omni friend recently, he had the vegan ramen and couldn't stop raving about it as well.  I decided to try the cauliflower on suggestion of the cashier and it was delicious even without any sauce.  Though the portion is a bit small.  I noticed the ramen looked smaller than the last time I ordered it, too (though last time I could barely finish half, the portion was huge).  The cashier was super helpful, suggested some vegan sides and sauce as well.  I was disappointed they didn't have an vegan donuts on a Thursday but he explained they have to make the doughs separately, which is understandable, but he commiserated with me, gave me extra sauce for free, and suggested that weekends are a good time to get the vegan donuts.  I love the outdoor seating, they have misters and lots of shade which made it feel much cooler than the 100 degree heat outside.  I also love the inclusive bathrooms.  I'll be back probably today for some ramen and donuts!  Excellent customer service, delicious food, nice seating, what else could you want?",

I'll start with, I've had a lot of donuts in my lifetime and these are by far the best I've ever had (or at least the filled ones). And the added bonus? They also serve fried chicken dipped in tasty Asian inspired sauces and bomb ass pork belly ramen. Weird combo? Absolutely not. The staff here is always impeccably nice as well. This place is kind of situated in a very unassuming area, and there's not much else around it. I like the outdoor seating here, but if it's too hot for the day they also have indoor seating available. If you get a meal, make sure to upgrade to a premium donut (you won't regret it). The donuts rotate daily, but my absolute favorite I've had here is the Key Lime Pie. If you ever see this one hanging out in the case grab it while you can. Trust me on this one.",

All were delicious! I can't pick a favorite so don't make me! We had some coffee and then we made a plan to return for lunch.  Lunch--- the line was a lot longer and it was significantly busier. We tried two chicken combos with different sauces- Japanese Bbq and Korean Chili. Chicken was crispy and juicy inside. Sauces were on point and the cake donut was to die for. The sides, slaw and cucumbers just added to the flavors. Yumm yumm! Reminded me of the mix of flavors in Roy Choi's food.  My only complaint is the girl that helped us BOTH times. When we told her it was our first time, she didn't care, no suggestions, no nothing, just a blank stare. We felt like we were bothering her with our menu questions and taking up her precious time. However, when she helped an unaccompanied male she was all smiles. Huh? I will say that the other guys at the register and in the back were very pleasant. Smiling and thanking everyone for waiting. You  can tell that they enjoy cooking and sharing their food.  Either way--- going back for sure... Just crossing my fingers I get one of the guys to help me!",

    "text": "On the way out of the rental car facility by Phoenix Airport, we drove by a sign that said chicken and donuts. Sold! We made a U-turn and immediately stopped in. From the outside, the building looks like an old school taco bell. But stepping foot inside, we were pleasantly surprised by new artsy decor and even more stoked to see the glorious donuts on display.   My group consisted of 5 hungry guys.  Donuts: The donuts were really good. Honestly, I would come just for the donuts. We tried about 6 different variations. I thought they all had bold flavor and a great doughy texture. I am a simple man when it comes to donuts. The maple ring really put a smile on my face.  Chicken: I opted for a 2pc combo that consisted of dark meat.  They had a choice of 5 different flavors. I went with the spicy Korean.  My first bite I thought wow! Bold flavor with just a little spiciness. Chicken was juicy and the batter/skin was still held up its crispiness.  But as I continued to eat, the saltiness of the sauce started to really make it a chore to eat.  I also was longing for a bit more fire. Overall, it is a pretty damn good piece of chicken if you stick to only a single piece.  Sides: My meal came with a choice of side. I chose the cucumber salad.  The salad wasn't as sour as regular Sumono, but I was kind of glad it wasn't. The bit of blandness and ginger flavor gave my palette a break as I was working through my salty chicken.  Overall: I thought that I would come back again for at lest the donuts and give the chicken another chance. I would recommend going there to try it yourself.",

I guess I'm just dissapointed that they run out of things so quickly, not sure if it's a ploy to make them seem \"cool\" but it's a definite turn off for the customer.  On to the food, we had 3 piece combo with  the Korean chili (and they had run out of drumsticks, what a surprise!) so they gave us a different piece. It was good at first but I couldn't finish it because it was just too sweet and didn't have the heat I was expecting.   We ordered a few donuts, they were okay. Ordered the blueberry cheescake and Peanut butter glaze with blackberry liquer...they're definitely creative with the flavoring but the actual taste was lacking.   I tried this place twice and each time I was just dissapointed. Please make enough or have enough food on hand to serve your customers, it's really annoying when you want to try something and it's always sold out...yes, I'm still bitter about the maple+bacon!!",

    "text": "I stopped in today because of the rave review from my sons father.... (Maybe he was tricking me)...anywho, I ordered 6 Korean chili wings, Thai slaw and a maple bacon donut. My son got just a plain drum and a glazed donut.......oh, and a $2 can of soda.  We received our donuts and went outside....my son tried his and immediately spit it out...he's 7 & a sugar fiend, wtf? So I tried it and it tasted like straight up yeast. My maple bacon donut was good though....kinda a lot of bacon but good.   Then, we received our chicken. Opened my box and the wings were full on wings....not cut. Not a big deal.....but I was disappointed. They were freaking good, lots of sauce, crispy on the outside and then.......there was raw chicken.  I'm kinda curious to know if the owner ever gets annoyed having to write the same rebuttal for every bad review... \"Organic\",\"red bird farms\",\"cooked to 165\",\"safe to eat\"........  I'm sorry but If I see blood or any pink in my chicken, I'm done! I Immediately looked at my sons chicken and yeah, a tad bloody. I understand that maybe it's the age (young) of the chicken that is being used that causes this and the chicken is actually safe to eat....maybe start using granny chickens?  Seriously though, there has to be a solution to this issue as it's just not appetizing to see blood in the chicken you're about to consume....",

We got the welcome griddle sandwich (bacon egg + cheddar with maple glaze on a cake donut). Having driven all across the southwest and experiencing the stomach pain of its mammoth portions, we decided to split one. This sandwich is definitely not for sharing. It's small, but RICH, on a perfectly made donut. We ended up turning around to grab a second one on the way out of town. Wish we had the time to hang out and try the chicken and ramen, pretty much everything on the menu looks (and smells) great.",

I spent rounded up $9.00 on a chicken thigh and drumstick with a cucumber salad. Not only was it overpriced for those two pieces, but it look as if the chicken was cooked too fast in old oil and not long enough. When I bite into the chicken it had an aftertaste and was pink with a tinge of blood inside. I expected more from an establishment serving food. When I tried to contact them shortly after the blood tinged chicken my call went unanswered after several attempts.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try this place out and ready to totally wreck any healthy eating plan I had in store for my trip to Phoenix. I will say that overall it was great. The fried chicken is superb and even without sauces is a near platonic ideal of what fried chicken should be. I tried 2 sauces. FIrst, the Korean chili sauce which is like a Gojijang sauce that you'd encounter with Bibimbop. Second was the Vietnamese sauce which I was thinking would make the chicken taste similar to Pok Pok's famous chicken wings (in Portland, NY and now LA). It however was a bit different and I would have preferred it a bit sweeter and a bit thicker/reduced. But they were both very good overall.   The donuts were really good and I would say they are probably better than any of the donut shops we have in Seattle. The star for me was the red wine and chocolate donut. The red wine frosting tasted and smelled strongly of red wine and played on that classic pairing very well. The Arnold Palmer and Thai Tea donut was tasty as well. I think it paired better with the chicken.   And that brings me to the only negative and reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars. Chicken and donuts don't necessarily go together. I love, love, love chicken and waffles. That combo of salty and sweet and crunchy just plays beautifully together. The denseness of the waffle holds up to being \"combined\" with the chicken. The donut, not so much. I found myself enjoying great chicken and great donuts but not great chicken and donuts. Still a fantastic place to eat but if they could find a way to get the two foods to mesh more I'd give 5 stars.",

Korean chili sauce was fantastic, waaay better than the Vietnamese sauce which was overly salty. Also make sure to get the corn stir fry as opposed to the cucumbers. A little disappointed they were out of maple bacon by noon considering it's supposedly one of their most popular you would think they'd make more. I took 2 stars away for their cleanliness, trash cans were overfilled with trash, like literally trash falling out of them, napkins and wet naps on the floors under the tables and the tables/booths needed a serious wipe down. Overall decent spot with great chicken at a good price but needs to be cleaner.",

The wait was then a lot longer than we expected but was made up for by the house giving us a free sweet potato pie donut, also delicious!! Once we got our chicken it was definitely worth the weight. It was crispy and didn't even need the sauces we ordered with them. We ordered two breast and drum combos and the six piece wings. The wings were huge so I would recommend just getting the six unless you are going to be sharing with a few people. Overall the atmosphere was great and they have a cute finer interior and then lunch tables outside for extra seating. This was a great find and the people who own the shop are very sweet. Wayne was really nice! We will be going back.",

    "text": "I visited a couple months ago, so this review is a bit late.  I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. The chicken is maybe the best fried chicken I've ever had outside of my own kitchen. It's amazingly tender and crisp. I got a combo of drumstick, thigh, the asian inspired slaw, and every single sauce on the side. All the sauces were excellent, even the daily sauce of asian inspired honey mustard. If you aren't a fan of fish sauce, I would deter you from trying the Vietnamese and fresh herb sauce, though. If you do like fish sauce, it's delicious. I think on my next trip I will have my chicken tossed in the Japanese barbeque and order the Vietnamese sauce on the side to dip them in. The staff is excellent. I will admit that I had an undercooked thigh, though. My friend also had undercooked chicken, but she didn't want to say anything. I asked the gentleman at the register for a replacement, and when the chef (I assume) saw this, he seemed very upset, presumably at the morning crew. The restaurant pre-frys the chicken, puts it on a cart, and then re-frys the chicken for the customer when ordered. The chef came out later to talk to me, apologized for the undercooked chicken, and in addition to replacing the thigh, they even gave me an extra drumette and some donuts to take home. I can't stress enough how kind that guy was. He seems like a good beer and chicken buddy, which I hope becomes a new thing. Again, the customer service here is excellent. I was an idiot, locked my keys in the car, and hung out for an hour and a half or so, but every interaction I saw between customer and employee was very friendly. For a gentleman who reviewed before, who complained about them not having chicken when he came, I think he needs to understand pars. I work at a restaurant, and depending on the season and the publicity, a restaurant needs to adjust the order, and it isn't always easy when things change dramatically, as maybe a restaurant gets a great review in a magazine. Back when he visited the restaurant, the Phoenix magazine had just named them a top 10 new restaurant, which I agree with. The food is great. Because of my car troubles, I was there until almost closing time. One single customer came in when they were out of fried chicken. They did, however, still have breakfast sandwiches (the pork belly slider special will definitely bring me back soon), and clearly posted it on the door that they only had breakfast sandwiches. The man who had come in was completely understanding as to the lack of chicken, though.  Why aren't all customers kind? Again, referring to the gentleman who complained before, restaurants run out of product. That's the simple truth. The shift or manager placing the order can only do her or his best at guessing the number of sales, hoping not to go over and cause waste, and hoping not to go under and disappoint people. It's mathematics and data-based presumption combined.  I drove 45 minutes to this store from North Scottsdale, locked my keys in my car with the engine on, waited an hour for my spare keys to be driven down, had an excellent meal, an excellent time, and wouldn't have traded that afternoon for another. I will definitely return, as the food is excellent, and every person with whom I interacted was exceptionally nice.  My name is Stirling Peters.",

The plain cake donut, which comes with the combo, was very tasty and light.  We loved it.  Good: I've never had a coleslaw that has wowed me, but the Thai Slaw was really good!  It was flavorful, not spicy (as you might think from the name), and not too sweet.  We'll definitely have it again.  Meh: You can get your fried chicken \"naked\" or with one of three sauces.  We each tried the Vietnamese with spices.  Nothing distinctive really stood out about the sauce and it was a little salty for our taste.  We'll be trying one of the other sauces, or go naked, on our next visit.  We will definitely be coming back!  The decor on the inside was bright and comfortable with local pictures and some local history.  Even better, they were not laying music on top of the natural noise of conversation and what is basically an open kitchen.  You can have a conversation in a relatively normal tone of voice - yeah!  Outside seating is shaded and is comprised of a very nice picnic table style setup.  A nice feature is that it is wheelchair compatible as the benches do not run the length of the tables.  Facing North you get a an up close view of planes landing and taking off, and towards the South a nice view of South Mountain.  We're looking forward to trying out breakfast and getting there before they sell out of yeast donuts!",
