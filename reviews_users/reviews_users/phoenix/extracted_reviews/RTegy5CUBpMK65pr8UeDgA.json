    "text": "My boyfriend is serious about his stroganoff so when he saw that Cafe Zuzu offered beef stroganoff our dinner was already set! I insisted on staying in the hotel for dinner because we were pretty tired from the drive (Palm Springs to AZ, approximately four hours) and we had bounced around the near by downtown area for lunch anyway. The place was quiet, but then again, it was also a Sunday night. Cafe Zuzu had a nice romantic ambiance to it. Kind of dark and the booths were put up against the wall, facing out to the dining room so it had a cool lounge feel to it too.  The service was really good. Our server was knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to eat and she was very patient and helpful with helping me make my decision. She explained the way things were cooked and what they were served with. I settled with sharing the stroganoff with my boyfriend and we ordered two sides; onion rings and mac and cheese. First the stroganoff; OMG I cannot wait to go back and have it again. I am a seriously serious mushroom fan and the mushrooms in the stroganoff were HUGE and perfectly cooked. The meet in it was filet and it was tendered and cooked to perfection. I could have done without the sour cream on top because the sauce was perfect in itself. As for the mac and cheese, that was amazingly delicious as well! The three different cheeses gave it an adult indulgence type of mac and cheese flavor. The three cheeses they chose (I'm not sure which cheeses the used) to mix were flavored in perfect harmony. I'm so glad I picked it! The onion rings were good too. Nothing really special there. However the dipping sauce was pretty yummy. It was aioli something or rather. But I was incredibly with our choices at the Cafe Zuzu and we can't till we're back next year! PLEASE don't get rid of or change your stroganoff recipe!!!",

All seating is at tables and while there are areas that could work for larger parties, this is a place that specializes in 4 or less a table.  Business lunches, retirees and folks who are staying at the hotel is your normal mid-week crowd.    The service is absolutely perfect - balancing that reserved resort restaurant demeanor with the upscale casual ambiance of the place.    Gotta tell you, I'm not amazingly impressed with the food.  It was very very good - but with all the hype, I'd just anticipated a bit more.  But the decor totally made up for it for me.  Very cool.  Personal note - I love their match boxes!  They are so cute I almost always have one in my purse - and I don't even smoke!",

ZuZu's brunch is absolutely fantastic, rife with comfort foods and thick cut bacon and midwestern-inspired dishes from kitchens with rosy colored grandmothers.  Its what I would imagine, in the matter of setting, decor and nourishment, Frank Lloyd Wright would sit down to every morning and gaze out into the world.  In the case of Cafe ZuZu, one is able to watch out of the glass paned wall into the area of the 50s inspired patio and pool area.  The bloody mary is very serviceable.  Not the best I've ever had, but very delicious to go along with fruit topped french toast.  And again, that bacon!  After brunch long passes, is another good time to re-enter into ZuZu .. for evening drinks on the patio.  With firepits roaring on chilly nights, its a very pleasant setting for a group of friends intent on a mellow night of chatting.  No ones gonna blow it out here, but its a nice spot to grab wine, beer, or specialty cocktails (which, come to discover taste like Pine-Sol and shit).    Anyway, ZuZu is a pretty unique spot in that you can start both your morning and your evening there before romping around Old Town.",

On a recent trip to Scottsdale for work, a colleague of mine and I had some morning eats at the restaurant inside Hotel Valley Ho. In all of the times that I've stayed at HVH, I've never had breakfast, and boy was I missing out till this month.   I had the veggie omelet with potatoes and an English muffin, typical for me! The omelet was HUGE...HUUUUUUGE. I would definitely suggest downsizing on the number of eggs, especially if you plan to go to town on the seasoned potatoes which were delicious. The muffin didn't have me jumping up and down yelling \"zuzuzuzu\" or anything, but I was so full after getting through the potatoes and half the omelet that it didn't matter that the muffin sort of got lost in the mix.   Although I couldn't get through the crazy amount of food, I asked the waitress for an A+ for effort. She did better than that and gave me two gold stars!",

They serve rolls and butter, and they are the real thing! A throwback for sure...super soft and warm! I might be addicted to iced tea (jury is still out) and I am delighted by how it is served here...big, tall glass, mint, a side of simple syrup for sweetening, and an iced tea spoon! It's the simple things sometimes that really add to my experience :) Not sure if they still serve this, but their cake & a shake for desert is to die for. Tiny chocolate shake served with tiny chocolate cake. Perfect little treat!",

    "text": "It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.   The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of \"Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist.\" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.   While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.   This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.",

Honey and I spent the night at the Valley Ho and sauntered down for breakfast around 9am on a Sunday. We were seated in a super swank booth immediately and had ice water and coffee within seconds of being seated. BONUS. Their silverware and coffee cups are so in tune with the whole VH scene, it just makes you feel...well, special. I wanted to steal the cute little teaspoons, but my Catholic guilt prevailed, as always. I ordered the banana buttermilk pancakes (a sucker for dessert for breakfast) and Honey got the Denver omelet. We perused the NY Times, had a refill of pretty good coffee (we are coffee snobs) before our food arrived which, in my assessment, was the perfect amount of time.  My pancakes were so pretty and seemed as happy to see me as I them. Outer edges thin and crispy, sliced bananas on top and...wait for it...a banana puree between each flapjack. OMG. Every bite was better than the last and I barely used half my ration of syrup as it seemed sacrilegious to mess with the medley of buttermilk and bananas in any way other than to fork it into my cakehole.  Honey's omelet was so vibrant looking which yes, is bizarre for an egged-up entree. But it was. The veggies were crisp tender and accounted for most of the ROYGBIV you'd want on a plate. Also the perfect balance of ham and cheese and served with yummy potatoes and lightly toasted sourdough.  All in all, we were very pleased and felt it was appropriate to return to our hotel room and nap off our fabulous start to the day. P.S. Dear Jesse T: ROYGBIV equates to all the colors of the rainbow. Beautiful work!",

If I was hungry enough, I totally would've done it.  Hell, I almost did anyway. Instead me and my lonesome moseyed up to the bar for some basketball and beer.  Serious comfort food menu, and I've gotta say, this weirds me out in such hot climates.  I feel like it should be all Mexican food or salads and fish dishes to combat the weather.  When it's 83 degrees out, do you really want blue cheese fondue or beef stroganoff?  Gross. Since it was only 60something, I opted for the ZuZu burger.  This is not a shy burger my friends.  In fact, when the bartender set it down and I lifted up the top bun, the burger jumped up and karate kicked me in the throat.  Serious.  Blue cheese and onions and bacon and SALT (duh).  What's a burger without fries, and these folks reeled me right in with their \"twice fried\" crispy critters.  Super super hot and crispy (and salty, gah, are you trying to give me a stroke?) upon arrival, some of the crisp faded away once they sat around for a while. I'd absolutely give this place another shot, there were so many yummy looking things on the menu that I had to go with my panic burger (\"Ah, what should I get?!  I've been staring at the menu for 15 minutes and the bartender has already given me suggestions and JUST PICK SOMETHING ALREADY!!!!!!!\" - you know how it is).",

I didn't notice the order when it went in but this is a terrible time to order oysters. Even in the best locales, raw oysters are not good right now. These were definitely not good. My friend and I got the flat iron steaks. They both came out at room temp. Not even warm. Same with the other items on the plate. We sent them back, waited until everyone else was basically done with their meals, then received the replacements....which were barely warm! I'd prefer it sit under a heat lamp and be served mostly warm or hot rather than room temp. It's just not that tough to serve a nice, warm or hot steak. Others seemed to enjoy their meal but two strikes and added time on $32 steaks doesn't cut it when there are so many other dining options nearby.",

There are always plenty of staff, bartenders, whoever, running around so I don't quite understand. Is it the yoga pants or what?  I've been here a couple of times before and enjoyed it. I like that they offer lotion and hand towels in the bathroom, the ambiance is very nice and sitting outside by the fire is lovely at night, but lately they haven't been on point! Tsk tsk.",

Okay, so upon arrival we had lunch at ZuZu and both ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  I've been eating pretty clean in preparation for the weekend pool party and endless mojitos, but this salad didn't make me sad!  It was delicious.  Another great item was the shrimp spring rolls.  Very light and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.",

    "text": "Delicious tender salmon with a lot of flavor ($25). It had a nice, lightly breaded crust with lemon and herb, and the sides that came with it were rich and flavorful as well (buttered rice and roasted butternut squash).  A plus for Cafe ZuZu is if you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine (Choice of 3 or 4 wines, listed on the check-in screen).  While the entree was delicious, the appetizer was a different matter.  We shared the ahi tuna sliders ($10), and I was surprised to see that there was no slider aspect of this appetizer, just slices of tuna with veggies.  The tuna itself was seared on the outside, but seared for too long so that the tuna was mostly cooked.  It had a light breading on the outside, but that couldn't save it from the lack of flavor.  The marinated vegetables that came as a side were more flavorful than the tuna itself!  Our waitress was lethargic with taking orders, getting our orders, serving us, and getting our bill.  Also, she didn't tell us any of the specials of the day, I had to specifically ask what they were.  Maybe it was because we were a large party so tip was already included, but she provided a very disinterested amount of service.  The atmosphere is relaxed, with a very open feel to the floor plan.  At night, it's a bit dark and the lights give off a red hue.",

I think if you are in a rush (or want to keep your drinks coming), sitting at the bar is an excellent option because the bartenders are very attentive! If you like blueberry muffins, they make a killer homemade muffin and it's HUGE with a very small price tag  (only $3.50).  Sunday late morning- we headed down for brunch, only to find a super talented musical duo playing really chill music- what a treat!  The chicken sandwich with Asiago cheese will thrill your taste buds and if you are staying at the valley ho- do yourself a favor and head down to eat at ZuZu in lieu of room service. Same food but way different quality- the in person experience totally trumps all",

Finally, after way too long, catching someones attention for a drink menu and then again, we wait for them to come back to take our order.  It was so bad it almost felt like we were being avoided/ignored. I don't smell. At least I don't think so...Maybe time for a new deodorant.  The consistency in lazy service is why only 3-stars.",

Also, Lo (aka: #216) is just about the rudest and most unfriendly bartender I've ever encountered--just downright ornery. When I gently questioned the happy hour policy, she responded with a, \"Listen, Sweetheart...\" Her condescending attitude was ridiculous and inappropriate. When I asked her why she had the audacity to call me \"Sweetheart\" in a particularly terse tone, her response was that she calls all of her patrons by that name. Really? Is that what they taught you in bartending school, Lo? I think not. Should I just call you, \"Server 216.\" The only reason I didn't give just one star is because the food and drinks are decent. The service is terrible. It's sad... Valley Ho has been a local treasure.",

The server took our drink order (mimosas) and came back with OUT OF THIS WORLD chocolate chip scones! They were delicious and we ate every crumb. My friend ordered the eggs benedict and I got the red velvet waffle. I tried her eggs benedict and it was awesome. My waffle was good- just a bit of a sugar overload since we had had the scones.

First off - the happy hour menu is unbelievably cheap; $3 specialty cocktails/wine/sparkling wine.  I think between the lot of us we tried every drink on the specialty menu.  My favorites were the Bramble, with gin, lemon & blackberry, and the Ho-Hattan with bourbon, vermouth & bitters.  YUM.  We had a divine grilled cheese sandwich w/ tomato soup for only $5, and the cheese plate was also great.  For breakfast I had the ZuZu breakfast casserole which was topped with the most perfectly poached egg I've ever had.  The level of attention to detail in the food here is incredible - they think of everything.   My only complaint is that a few of the servers were a bit snooty and not very attentive.  We went stretches of approximately 20 minutes without anyone stopping by.  But we think we figured out the problem....there was a female manager working when we first sat down who was SUPER bitchy.....an hour or so later she appeared to have ended her shift and suddenly EVERY server was super cheerful and awesome....hmmm.  We had a server at breakfast who was one of the best I've ever had; wish I would have gotten her name.  EDIT*** I just realized I forgot to mention my FAVORITE part!!!  You HAVE to order a side of grits for breakfast.  They're unreal.  I've never been a big grits fan because of texture issues but these were amazing.  Apparently mascarpone is involved....off I go to attempt a recreation!  :)",

    "text": "Love the ZuZu.  Everything from the atmosphere to the food.  Not to mention their awesome happy hour -- pretty sure it goes until 7 pm, which is longer than most in Scottsdale.    My fiance and I live down the street from ZuZu, but never tried it out for the longest time as it's connected to the Valley Ho Hotel and semi-hidden.  I wish we would have tried it sooner to know what we were missing.  They have something for everyone whether you want a fun cocktail, an appetizer or a full meal.  We always eat in the bar area - it has a great retro vibe with funky chairs and fun wall decor.  I'm a fan of their bramble (gin + lemon & blackberry) and the sangria.  At happy hour, their drinks are only $5.  As for food, I love their seasoned fries, I believe they have some sort of garlic powder on them, and they are served with a delicious chipotle aioli.  Very difficult to stop eating the fries once you start.  I also loove the chicken quesadilla, which comes stuffed with mango and jalapenos + sides of sour cream, guac & salsa - amazing combination!  The burger is also pretty killer.  Be sure to get the one with bacon and BBQ sauce, it's finger-licking good.    My fiance and I have only had dinner at the ZuZu once, we tend to keep it as a happy hour spot.  If you're looking for a fun place to start your evening, or to unwind after work, check out Cafe ZuZu!    PS - Wine Wednesdays are also a great hit for HH.  The first time my fiance and I ever visited ZuZu was on a Wednesday, and they were serving Silver Oak for only $5 a glass.  If you know anything about wine, you know that Silver Oak is a very nice wine, sold at Costco for at least $75 a bottle, or upwards of $150 a bottle at a restaurant.  $5 a glass at ZuZu was insane and probably what started our love affair with the joint.",

Then the Gala Burger for dinner.  So much food I couldn't finish it.  The cocktails were great this time around.  We'll be back next time we're in Scottsdale.",

Their appetizers on the regular dinner menu were really good but a little too pricey. I would probably only return for a quick drink at the bar with a friend. The strawberry lemonade was good.",

    "text": "So we were going to a show at Stand Up Scottsdale - and pulled our our trusty yelp app trying to find something within walking distance.  ZuZu was close enough that it was worth trying.  It took us a while to figure out how to get in (located near the lobby of the Valley Ho hotel) - but once we did, I had to shake my head as I thought I was stuck inside the movie Casino.  The decor / ambiance looked almost exactly like DeNiro & Sharon Stone's house in Vegas.  This instantly calmed me - much like warm milk.  Even though we only had about a half hour, the waitress made a couple spot-on recommendations (Beef Stroganoff & Pork Chop) - and after checking in on yelp we even got a free glass of house wine!  I'm not often in Scottsdale, but will be back due to the delicious food and retro ambiance.  Well played ZuZu, well played.",

From the outside, I wasn't sure if I wanted to have a meal at a motel, but once inside I'm glad we followed through. it was my dad's birthday so all the retro charm actually served up some good memories for him when he saw interiors like this the first time. I'm used to small plates meaning \"several plates til you feel full.\" Here that meant two plates. The dressing on the kale salad took away any inherent bitterness and the lamb sausage had a great spice to it. The almond cake was moist and easily divvied up between us.",

The French dip was mediocre, but hard to beat for $3. the margaritas were light and very good- tequila, agave, lime juice - better than most places!

Definitely stop by for their mimosas and you-make-it bloody mary (which was my first time!) great selection and you can make your own.  For dinner, I had the gnocchi app as an entree and it was delicious, decadent, luxurious and creamy - my favorite!

You'll dine in mid-century modern style, be entertained by live music, enjoy the outdoor patio and feel like you're on vacation on some tropical island somewhere.   Once you're seated, you'll enjoy warm, complimentary chocolate chip scones, and they are SO good! The chocolate is all melty and I'm pretty sure I tasted a hint of cherry in there. We ordered coffee and champagne because, why not?! The coffee was VERY strong and I only ended up drinking about a half of my cup. We sprung for the Moet vintage rose which was de-lish!   Even though the menu is very concise, it was very difficult for me to choose what to order. Everything looked so good! I settled on the Eggs Benedict and opted for the cheese grits. The bene was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. But, those cheese grits were to die for! And I'm not typically a grits kind of girl.   Our service was just alright. We think our server had our table, which was located at the very back of the dining room by the kitchen, as well as some tables all the way out on the front of the patio, so sometimes she would be around, but mostly, she was not. Also, as she was pouring the last of our champagne, she poured the entire remains in to one person's glass, instead of splitting it evenly among the three of us (like you're supposed to) and claimed that the bottle was so heavy she didn't realize it was almost gone. Rookie move. And definitely frustrating since we forked out quite a bit of dough for that bottle.  I definitely hope to come back to ZuZu the next time I'm in town, though!",

You instantly feel comfortable in this restaurant. And from a food & drink standpoint you will not be disappointed!! This was a birthday dinner for a friend, so we each splurged on the \"Second Star from the Right.\" Let me tell you- you can easily go straight on til midnight. You get your moneys worth in the amount of rum included, but the rest of the drink balances flavors so its not overpowering. We enjoyed the appetizer of cast iron provolone- which was perfection. The cast iron gave a crisp to the outer part of the cheese while still remaining gooey in center. The tomato jam added the right contrast to the richness. We split both the scallops and the short rib. The scallops were divine! Melt in your mouth, rich, deep flavor. The short rib didn't need a knife it was so tender and flavorful. Finally we had the showstopper shake- so festive, fun, and full of sugar! The shake part was the best- mixed berry ice cream!",

    "text": "We stopped in for Restaurant Week and sooo glad we did! We had reservations for 7pm but got there early and was promptly seated in a great little corner booth. My boyfriend and I each had a cocktail and looked over the restaurant week menu (you can also order off the full menu as well). Everything looked great on the restaurant week menu so we each decided on ordering off of that. My boyfriend started with the Coffee Rubbed Bison Carpaccio and I had the Lobster + Asparagus Anson Mills Grits and both were OUTSTANDING! I am craving mine still. We then both settled on the Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. Normally we bot get something different but we were both craving that. It was soooo good. The portions were HUGE too! I couldn't finish all of mine. Then for dessert we both settled on the Lemon Meringue Posset and it was so refreshing!   Our server was excellent as well.   It had been years (since they reopened in the early 2000's) and that was the last time I had eaten at ZuZu and it was not impressive at all hence why I had not been back in years but after this dinning experience we will certainly be back soon whether for cocktails and apps or dinner.",

Rolls came .. Ok Menu was Hmmm only like five six Entrees.. So not much of a selection..I decided try something different not a steak.. Oh was I disappointed.. Half Chicken no seasoning , the tomato something at bottom tasted like tomato soup and a waste of good hazel nuts thrown in with one small onion and Im not sure what else.. Husbands scallops over cooked and his risotto I think he said literally he was removing 1/3 of it because it was burnt.. I dont like sending dishes back because you just never know..Our waitress was great.. But Menu needs an updo..",

    "text": "I came here for breakfast on a Monday morning as I was staying in Hotel Valley Ho. It's in the lobby and hard to beat the value of being able to walk from your room.   They bragged about being able to eat 'poolside' and I thought I'd try to enjoy that. Living in Seattle, anytime you get sunshine is a good thing.  The restaurant is completely empty and I asked the waitress if I could sit outside. She tells me yes and to have a seat wherever I'd like and she'd be out.   She brings me a menu and I order some OJ. She comes back out and asks what I'd like to order. The process seems to be going easy and fast enough and I think \"Huh. Not too bad.\"  One little sidenote: The menu upstairs for Cafe Zuzu in the hotel rooms had different prices than the menu in the restaurant.  I ordered the fruit plate and a cinnamon roll.   The waitress brings out my food & promptly forgets about me. One other couple joined me out on the patio and she only came out to take their order once and didn't return for quite a while.   It was so bad that I had to go inside after 20 mins to ask her if she could bring me my check. When I walked inside, the restaurant was still empty and she was re-filling the sugar containers.   I don't expect her to hover while people are enjoying their meal but I had finished my OJ and had obviously finished my meal and was just waiting for her to come back.   When she finally did bring my bill, she was just rude and abrupt.   Perhaps it is an Arizona thing but the servers and hotel staff did not seem pleased to be doing their jobs. And paying clients like myself are the ones who have to suffer.",

    "text": "How many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting, well reviewed or recommended restaurant, been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal?  Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes? Wanted to know what goes into getting food on your plate?  As an avid foodie this is something that is always on my mind so when Chef Sean Currid of Cafe ZuZu at Scottsdale, Arizona's Hotel Valley Ho invited me into his kitchen to observe Service firsthand, I jumped at the opportunity!  Cafe ZuZu, set in the historic Hotel Valley Ho on the Western edge of Old Town Scottsdale, is a hidden gem. Not only are the grounds nostalgic but the food is fantastic and the atmosphere relaxing.  I entered the kitchen towards the end of \"Happy Hour,\" and got the grand tour from Chef Currid. One thing I noticed immediately was how small the dry storage and walk-in refrigerators were, indicating freshness of ingredients through rapid use.  In the kitchen, Chef Currid can be found on the line, sleeves rolled up, preparing dishes and directing his kitchen crew, care and experience ensuring every dish goes out True to concept.  What I was most interested in was the food and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint! Beginning with happy hour small plates priced at $3 each ($5-$6 is what I would have expected to pay for these delights), I ate my way thru Chef Currid's cuisine.  Chicken drumettes fried to a crisp, golden brown, lightly seasoned and served with bourbon honey dipping sauce got things started. These plump little chicken tasties were a pleasant break from the ubiquitous wing and paired with what can only be compared to liquid gold (honey bourbon sauce), are a must have!  Walking through the kitchen earlier I had noticed a HUGE herb crusted prime rib roast preparing to spend a few hours in a hot oven, this meat found it's way onto the next plate as a Prime Rib dip sandwich.  Shaved nearly paper thin, topped with melted cheese and placed atop a crusty baguette, complimented by a rich, flavorful jus and horseradish mayo, this sandwich delivered far in excess of $3 worth of flavor!  There's something about grilled cheese that's comforting but Cafe ZuZu takes it to a whole different level with their Artisan grilled cheese duo.  Crunchy, buttery sliced baguette topped with melted Brie cheese, crisp green apple and fig jam, these little jewels are absolutely packed with flavor, texture and are about the best thing to pass my lips in recent memory! (simple, elegant, perfect and at $3, the best deal in the Valley!)  No happy hour menu is complete without good bruschetta and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint. Bright red, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese are combined to make this classic, simple dish.  As happy hour ended, the first of the dinner appetizers went past my fork. Butternut squash ravioli ($10), followed by Prince Edward Island Mussels ($10)  The giant al dente ravioli stuffed with creamy butternut squash, topped with sauteed diced squash, looked and tasted lovely! A quenelle of pumpkin cream melted into the dish providing the perfect accompaniment and a touch of micro greens for color an texture rounded this dish out nicely.  There aren't too many things better in my opinion, than a plate of mussels in a rich, savory broth. Paired with spicy Spanish chorizo, ZuZu's Prince Edward Island mussels, tomato and fennel are just devine! Did I mention the white wine and garlic broth?  As my time in Chef Currid's kitchen drew to a close (and the button on my jeans began to strain dangerously), the evenings featured dish found it's way in front of me and a fresh fork materialized in my hand.  Tender Sauteed beef tips, garlic roasted potatoes, roasted root vegetables including beets, parsnip and even a little Brussels sprout sneaked in (I'd never have believed this would be one of my favorite vegetables), all on a rich port wine reduction, perfectly executed and absolutely delicious. Find a rainy day, order this dish if it's available and prepare to be satisfied.  A roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole ($9.50) went by too fast for me to divert and get my fork into but from the looks of it and after having sampled the previous dishes, I'd bet it is worth a return visit.  All in all, my time as an observer in Chef Currid's kitchen at Cafe ZuZu was well spent. The cuisine is far beyond what you might expect of a typical \"hotel restaurant,\" and absolutely worth investigating.  Whether you're looking for a generously priced happy hour delivering food far beyond expectation or a gourmet meal without pomp and circumstance, Cafe ZuZu delivers!",

As much as I have enjoyed other meals, I always miss having that sin on a plate.  And where else are you going to find that dish anymore?  My only criticism is sometimes they don't drain the noodles enough, and there's too much water in the bowl.  But even that can't ruin the rich mushroom sauce with the pint of sour cream on top just waiting for me to marry the two.  Enough for two meals!  My 2013 resolution?

I've been here for brunch and had the infamous red velvet waffles and I've also had dinner here a few times. All the visits have been spectacular in both the service and the taste of food. In fact, I chose this place as my birthday dinner and bring every out of towner here if that says anything on how much I like it! The only thing I wish I could skip would be the valet. As a side note, I've also been to the spa here and had a great experience getting a facial.",

The truffled grilled cheese amazing as well. The strozapetti pasta deeeeeeliiiiisssssshhhhh. The seared ahi salad yum.  And, if you are there for happy hour don't miss the pickled vegetable tostada.  It is absolutely delicious and super light!  Great appetizer!  Service is great, decor is great.   This is truly a five star restaurant in my book!",

The rock walls jutting in from the outside and the windows are reminiscent of the my home growing up.  The food was Delicious and the service was exceptional.  I had the ZuZu burger with fresh hand cut fries, I love a good burger and this did not disappoint.  The Chef thought my fry order was a little little light so he sent out more.  I just wish there were more places like this, paying attention to the details and service taking it from great to Fabulous.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate at ZuZu for Sunday morning brunch as part of a group of eight that meets at a different restaurant every month. We've been doing this for about 14 years. In recent times, places are very happy to provide separate checks. It seems that restaurant software has made great strides, so that it isn't much work to separate the checks. It wasn't always this way, so we appreciate it when it happens.  Well, at ZuZu it was like the old days. Our server said that he couldn't give us separate checks, but that he would take separate forms of payment. We've been to other places where they didn't separate the check, but gave each person or pair the total with the tax and tip included. This person just told us to give him payment, and tell him how much we wanted him to charge.   It felt like the restaurant management's attitude was, \"It is too much trouble for us to do the math for you. You should be happy that we cook the food and serve it on the same day you order it. Our food is so good, and we are so cool, how could you expect more?\"  It seems like this whole review is about money. That may be because we felt that there wasn't much to say about the food. I had the Eggs Benedict, which were small both in size and in taste. The grits, even after I added butter and salt, tasted like rice pudding with no sugar. Different, and uninteresting. My wife had blue corn pancakes, most of which is still sitting in our fridge. To be fair, the scones were wonderful.  It seemed that the food took a long time to come out, which became a topic of conversation in our group, most of whom don't usually complain about such things. The mandatory gratuity they added because of our big party was 20%. Most often, if there is gratuity added at all, it is 18%. For that extra 2%, how about separate checks?  So, while we enjoyed the mid-century chic ambiance, we were not impressed with our visit to ZuZu. We do appreciate how quickly they refunded the amount that we were overcharged when we called back a couple of hours later. That was nice of them.",

    "text": "Eggs, tomatoes, gruyere, lettuce, all on toasted sourdough with accompanying roasted potatoes sounds and looks like the perfect post-party breakfast cure, but on the morning I dined at ZuZu, my eyes were apparently much more ambitious than my stomach.   After not eating ONE bite of my plate, the manager came out to make sure everything was alright. Of course it was, I'm just the idiot that ordered the delicious food and couldn't bring myself to eat it. She offered for me to pick something else out, but at the point, nothing was going to happen for me. Although it might seem weird to review a place where one didn't actually manage to eat anything, I thought the service and the fact that they reached out to make sure everything was okay was worth mentioning.   I did manage to nibble on those potatoes and, man, I'd be tempted to order just a plate of those next time They were greasy enough, and hearty bites full of carbs. I have to take this time to say, our server was very yelly, and I wasn't the only person to notice. It was pretty disturbing to overhear everything each table was ordering, but I know she was just trying to be clear. It was in all honesty, startling every time she opened her mouth. Just plain loud. Despite that, she was really helpful in rearranging some tables and our accommodating our group as it grew throughout the morning.   Can't wait to come back on an empty stomach and indulge here!",

As long time valley residents (my husband is a native who grew up nearby), we were particularly thrilled to see this historic landmark refurbished and the architecture and style respected. We strolled around the grounds a bit and I have to say this would make a great stay-cation and was certainly a great place to come for brunch.",

Anyway...  The food is outstanding, drinks are delicious, different and reasonably priced, and the bar tenders (who at this point are friends) are fun to be around. Definitely a cool/swanky place to unwind. The boyfriend seems to like to grab lunch on saturday afternoons when the pool party is going on. Wonder why. You're welcome, gentlemen.

I made a reservation so I thought that we would get a good table. We were sat at a table that was REALLY dark. I looked around and realized the light above the table was out. Oh well no biggie.   One of the odd things is the waitress seemed a bit more interested in showing us what was on the drink menu instead of any interesting food items. We even had to ask what the soup of the day was. Hmm...   We had reviewed the menu online and my wife thought the BLT salad would be good. I decided to order the Jidori Chicken so we could share.   When I ordered the chicken I was informed it would include mashed potatoes even though it was not on the menu. Oh Good! so I thought.   We received our entrees at a reasonable amount of time. When the chicken was served it had potato wedges that looked a bit overcooked. What happened to the mashed potatoes? The chicken was good however I do not think it is worth the price.  After all it is JUST chicken. I also ordered grilled asparagus but they seemed overcooked. I later found out from my wife that her salad had sand in it. What? She said sometimes it is not worth complaining. We didn't share my chicken because my wife lost her appetite.  About halfway through my meal I ordered another beer. However, it did not arrive until I was done. I told the waitress I was done and no longer wanted the beer. This caused the manager to come by and inform me that because the beer was too late for the meal he was going to remove it from the ticket. I thought DUH?  I had high hopes. Must have been the ZuZu of the alternate world of \"It's a Wonderful Life\".",

With the renovations on the patio making it cooler ( with the overhangs and newer and nicer  seating ) which is also dog friendly make this one of our favorite stops... brunch was fantastic as was our server \"Nathan\" ... we had the salmon platter, duck confit and French toast ! The mimosa / bloody mary Bar were awesome !  Can't wait to come back !!",

    "text": "Wow. This was one of my favorite places to eat ever! I made a group reservation on Open Table a few weeks before the actual dining out during AZ Restaurant Week and by the day of, it had dwindled to 4. They weren't offended or upset and were quite nice to accommodate our smaller group.   Since I'd never been before, I was unaware that they have free valet, so I parked on the city streets. Not a bad little walk, but next time I know better. The lobby opens into the ZuZu bar area, but the actual hostess stand is tucked a bit back there [maybe it should be moved up closer?]. A manager and a hostess greeted me both quite warmly and directed myself and one of the girls to a table. Zach was our server and was amazing from the beginning. He gave us his personal favorites on the menu, both drinks and food wise. Made us all laugh at how much he loves peanut butter and their PB dessert on the AZRW menu!  The ambiance is totally trendy, but with an ode to the 1960s/70s. Around 7/8p on the weekends, you'll find some good background music. Totally adds to the environment. This would be a great date night selection.  I started with the New Fashioned cocktail. I typically prefer vodka or gin-based cocktails but this one rocked my socks. Both Zach and the house manager PJ recommended it. On that subject...can I just say how nice PJ was?! He came by our table a few times throughout the night to check in on us.   One of the girls ordered the Mac n cheese as an appetizer as an addition to our AZRW sides. I'd never had mussels before and absolutely LOVED them. If it wasn't looked down upon, I probably would've drank the broth straight from the bowl. A little disappointed at how small my main course filet was because I wanted more! It was delicious. Out of our group I was the only one to get the Panama Cotta for Desert. Might've been the best course! So rich and sinfully good.  I can totally see myself coming back but maybe actually stay the night at the resort too.",

    "text": "Run, don't walk, to ZuZu.  We came for Christmas Dinner and the prix fixe menu had more variety (five different entrees to choose from) and was less expensive than any hotel buffet options on a night when most restaurants are closed.  It was the best Christmas Dinner we've ever had eating out.  The appetizers (crab legs, shrimp, salad, charcuterie, fruit, creamy soup, etc.) alone would have made this a five star review and been a complete meal.  The dessert buffet was amazing with bread pudding, macarons, and lots of other desserts and treats.  Truly to be experienced.  The place has a unique positive, young, vibrant, and fun vibe while being a nice spot for family and friends.  We came back the next day for brunch to get the Showstopper shake (white chocolate this month with donut and candy cane and loads more) and to also try the fries and burgers.  You think:  Oh sure, this is a little overblown.  Nope - they exceed expectations.  They were amazing (a shake served in a glass overflowing onto a cookie sheet with donuts, etc.).  For our crew a Showstopper shake could easily have served three, even four of us.  It is really out of this world.  Very creative and sweet and tasty and just fun.  What a unique restaurant.    Fun is ZuZu.  If you have a bad time at Zuzu's -- it is on you.  We loved the vibe of the place.  The mid-century modern unique Southwestern bricks (designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright).  We loved the valet guys being prompt and pleasant.  Loved the mid-century vibe of the whole place.   Two meals, almost in a row.  Totally different.  Both amazing.",

    "text": "I drove by the hotel on my travels during a business trip to a new city and it was a neck turner spotting the hotel building--due to its mid-century glamour. I made a mental note of the restaurant name and made the effort to go back. In my few short days visiting Scottsdale, I found myself hungry for a light bite around 6:00 so I checked in to their happy hour. Parking was confusing because all of the spots had a sign saying \"Valley Ho permit only\" but I took a chance and parked there, wandering in to where I thought may lead to the restaurant...side note that Scottsdale is NOT pedestrian friendly at all--and there seems to be no consideration given to the design of entryways for places being entered by foot..anyway, my gamble was met by a very friendly staff person who when I called her, showed me to the restaurant and who told me \"you're a customer! no permit needed\". I was in immediate awe of my surroundings. The original architect of the Valley Ho hotel was Edward L Varney, who designed the building in 1956. This staff person gave me a mini history lesson on the place and I was enraptured. I spend a leisurely hour, solo, at a cocktail table, sipping on a custom made margarita (just a drop of simple syrup, with salt) and the yummiest green chili pork stew I've ever had, meanwhile snapping pics and being transported to the fabulous fifties. An absolute gem!",

    "text": "I never give reviews because mostly I am extremely flexible and understanding of when restaurants have bad nights. But my experience tonight warrants this review. Having spent the day at the valley Ho pool as a hotel guest. I went inside to enjoy a meal. Wearing a one piece swimsuit with a sarong I was approached by a guest who told me my outfit was inappropriate. I laughed her off as my one piece swimsuit and full length skirt covered more than most outfits I see on general guests who are attending the restaurant. I was then approached by someone who may or may not have been a part of the resort who explained to me that I was violating policy by being in the hotel lobby, that they had received a complaint which I imagine was the original woman who approached me. As I stated was a sexist policy that required me to be fully clothed while men were not required to be the same she explained that she could have security come and explain the rules to me. At this point I chose not to engage any longer and left the restaurant.   My bathing suit was a one piece that fully covered me, in all fairness it was mostly backless, but I was also wearing a full black skirt that covered from my waist to my ankles. I was no more exposed than a small tank top with a long full length skirt. I honestly have never been more embarrassed or angry in my life at this interaction.  The service staff was surprised at what transpired and was actually helpful to me as I left the restaurant. Honestly, I felt slut shamed and demoralized at this interaction. I felt as though I was sexualized for just trying to eat in the restaurant and that it speaks more to other people's issues than anything else. In this age businesses should be more attuned to women's voices and should not be seeking opportunities to slut shame them for wearing clothes that one person deems inappropriate .",

I walked to the back and was greeted by the hostess (super sweet and friendly).  I was seated and glazed over the menu.  Lots of yummy choices.  The server swung by to check on me since I was still waiting for my friend.  She took my drink order and bought it to me ASAP.  My friend came and we decided to each order a breakfast dish and then split a dessert.  So I got the two eggs any style (scrambled), sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast.  And we split a stuff French toast.  Everything was good.  The French toast was awesome!  Only con was the server kept trying to refill my ice tea with ice brew.  It happened 2 of the 3 times.

We got their at 2:30 and they were confused that we had an OpenTable reservation since they said they don't take reservations in the afternoon and they weren't serving regular menu (huh?).  Didn't matter, there was plenty of seating outside, the weather was beautiful, and the lounge (bar) menu had sandwiches and apps, plus drinks, so plenty to eat.    We asked for the shake first, in case it was too filling and we couldn't eat lunch after.  The waitress came back and said the chef couldn't make the shake at that time.  What??  Since that was the whole purpose of our visit, I suggested to my husband that we leave, but he said we should stay since we were already there.  We ordered sandwiches.  Shortly after the waitress returned and told us the pastry chef COULD make us a shake (um, ok) so we ordered one.    The shake was amazing - definitely needs to be shared but presentation was gorgeous and it tasted yummy (we were there in Feb 2018 and shake was red velvet cupcake with cream cheese milkshake).  Not long after our shake was brought out, our sandwiches were served (really too close together).  Sandwiches were really good - I had California Turkey BLT and my husband had the burger; we both enjoyed our sandwiches.  Chips served with sandwiches were especially tasty!    Next time I will call to confirm when we can order the shake and we will order and enjoy that first and then see if we really want (can fit) lunch.  Our waitress was good but I feel like the timing of food could be improved.",

There outside dining is more like poolside cafe which wouldn't be bad if the food could have won me over. My date and I both ordered the filet medium rare. We both appreciate and know a prime cut of filet. Filets should be mouthwatering tender, almost melting in your mouth. Filets are one of the leanest cuts of meat. This cut had quite a bit of gristle which makes me believe it wasn't a filet. Filets are thick. This cut was thin. To make it worse ZuZu's cooked the steak medium well.  On a positive note. The staff was very nice!! I told them about my steak so they cooked a new one to bring home and did not charge me for the steak. Very much appreciated!! Sadly, I won't go back for dining.",

There is a nice indoor and outdoor seating area. Service was quick and our server kept checking on us which was nice! We went for brunch and there were some great options! A little bit of everything, some unique options too. I ended up getting the crispy Belgian waffle. My mom and sister got omelets and my BF got a red velvet waffle. We also shared a cinnamon roll and I tried out the mimosa bar! Best thing I had was my waffle. Only thing that was weird about it was there was dried cherries on it, I thought that was an odd topping also it didn't say that on the menu. My bfs waffle was a little too dense but otherwise yummy. My mom and sister liked their omelets! The cinnamon roll was a letdown..looked amazing but just was super bread-y, like not at all gooey like a cinnamon roll should be. My mimosa was delicious too, the mimosa and Bloody Mary bar was cute. Overall a good experience!!",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that if I was rating ZuZu based off of the food alone, I'd give 4 or 5 Stars. Unfortunately, some other factors pulled it down. We stayed at Valley Ho, and experienced ZuZu 3 times, for drinks at the bar, for late night drinks and deserts, and then again for brunch. The bar was great - drinks were very good, with creative cocktail options, and good service. Deserts were good, but I felt like they looked a little bit better than they tasted. I'd give them a 7.5 on a 10pt scale. The brunch is what knocks my rating down. We showed and, despite a decent number of ready/open tables, we were told it was a 15 minute wait, then, 15 minutes later, we were seated at one of those tables that had been open that entire time. Not a huge deal. But then it took forever just to get water and order drinks. I'm not sure if the waitress was flustered about something or just forgetful (restaurant wasn't very busy at this point), but she got my wife and I's drink mixed up less than 3 minutes after we ordered. Then it took forever to get her to come back to order food, and then after that it took quite a while to get the food, which didn't come out the way we ordered it the first time. It was eventually taken care of, but as you can tell, the whole experience from arriving to receiving our food seemed like a bigger ordeal than it was worth. One we had our food and everything was correct, the food was great - no complains at all there! But after we finished, it was back to the waiting game: my wife left and was at the pool for 20 minutes before the check was actually brought over to me.  An improvement to the service at the sit-down dining portion of ZuZu could easily add a star back to my rating.",

While we were there for drinks several of the Halloween themed martinis were calling my name, but I settled on a glass of Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc instead.  And it was perfect.  Gabi K and I considered staying for dinner, but Jared M didn't seem too thrilled with his pasta from there (even though he polished it off) so we decided to go elsewhere.  2 days later we were back at Cafe ZuZu for brunch.  This time the choice of what to order wasn't so easy! Wheat pancakes or homemade granola and fruit?? Decisions, decisions. Fortunately, our uhmazing waitress (wish I could remember her name to give her props) made the decision for me.  She offered to split the homemade granola, wheat pancakes and even a side of scrambled eggs among Gabi and I.  As our food came I had to take a call and when I finally returned to the table my eggs and pancakes were cold. Gabi mentioned that the fabulous waitress did offer to keep them warm for me, but she wasn't sure how long I'd be gone.   Everything was still tasty though- even when cold!  A fine option for those staying a the Valley Ho and even a good spot for locals to stop by..",

For whatever reason the waitress ordered all of our food at one so guess what? All the food came out at once.. I was pretty ticked off about this as the same thing happened at Cheesecake Factory (haven't been back, yuck!).. a place of this caliber sending out salads on top of entre's left me scratching my head. So my fillet sat there and got cold while I finished my salad.. sent it back. The chef came out (WOOF!) and talked to me about the timing which I thought was very cool.. he ended up making me a special plate of the most yummy braised lamb served with creamy grits.. both were awesome and I hate grits.. I was cleaning the plate with a fresh made dinner roll.. was great!!  The pastry chef made the entire table a sampling of desserts.. he makes lemon meringue pie just like mom.. plus being cute as a button.. well you know me, I'm a sucker for a chef!   If it weren't for the chef I would have banged this place badly due to the timing issue but his charisma and charm won me over.. well, actually it was the lamb!!",

Not only is this a great option for people staying at the hotel connected to it (which gave me complimentary valet service!) it has a great atmosphere and food to boot!            I met my former Yelp boss, Aimee K, for breakfast here this morning and absolutely loved the vintage retro vibe. I was waiting for go-go dancers, a disco ball and some Saturday Night Fever, but seeing Aimee was good enough for me!          Service can be a wee bit slow, but we were also chatting up a storm and I think she was trying to give us time to catch some air in between sentences.     The coffee was good and refills with this and water were endless and attentive. I ordered the Garden Fresh Veggie Omelet with egg whites and must say it was pretty splendid! The oven roasted tomatoes were so sweet and literally burst in my mouth while the squash and basil complimented the goat cheese very nicely. The goat cheese was whip-like, super creamy and oozed out tastily.        The breakfast potatoes were delicious, but I only let myself have a couple (trying to behave around my obsession with food is difficult!) And this also comes with toast and homemade preserves.        This should not be overlooked simply because it is connected to a hotel, this restaurant brings its own awesomeness to the table!",

The big difference is that this place makes it the way my mom never would...with real butter, whole milk and cheese on top.  G'damn.  It wasn't just the grits that got me all hot and bothered.  Let me break it down:  *O.J. - fresh squeezed.  No fillers here; it is the real deal.  *Blue Plate Special - on this particular day, it was a scramble with bacon (that's all I needed to hear), mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions and covered in your choice of hollandaise sauce or swiss cheese (I chose the former of the two).  It is served up with a side of potatoes and toast.  Holy hearty!!!!  It was cooked well and so delicious.  Only gripe is serving butter on the side rather than buttering the toast right away; it never melted!!  *Grits - yeah, yeah...enough about that.  *The patio - it was a gorgeous morning and I am glad we chose to sit outside.  The pool was nearby and opening up as we were there.  The landscaping at this hotel is divine; nice flowers, chic 60s decor.  It is top notch.  *OUR WAITRESS!!! - her name escapes me, which sucks because she was a GREAT server.  Asked cool questions without being overbearing, offered to take our photo, made sure we had what we needed at all times.  She was fantastic!  Next time I am here, I will hit up this place again.  I absolutely loved this little oasis in the Scottsdale desert!",

Ask for a booth and were about to be seated when I noticed that of all the booths available, hostess was about to seat us beside a four top with a crying infant and two year old.  Requested a different booth and she accommodated, and we were given a \"brunch menu\". Waited a while to be noticed, but eventually we we served water. Again waited for someone to notice we wanted to order.mFood came out, but we had to request utensils. Fruit side looked excellent, turkey sandwich okay, but accompanying chips were stale and Eggs Benedict served on tough pastry of some sort which I could not cut with my knife.  Side of cheesy grits was inedible.  Requested and received small oven baked potatoes instead. No one offered the complimentary chocolate scones mentioned in other recent reviews. If I had known, I would have asked for them because we certainty paid for them. All in all, a disappointment, because we are considering purchase of an expensive condo across the street and really wanted to like this place.  Have been searching for the happy hour menu without luck. A fond memory of staying at the Valley Ho. Upon arriving Phoenix three decades ago.  The place still has an excellent, fun vibe.",

I really like the effort the chef puts in about getting locally sourced produce and products when they can.  Also, everything is extremely high quality from the fresh produce all the way to the awesome desserts.  I would say it is like higher-end comfort food, but with special flair from the chef depending on what fresh ingredients he gets in.  Also, the price is ridiculously good for the quality of meal you are getting.   The name makes it sound like a coffee shop in the middle of a hotel but it is so not.  It's decorated mid-century modern and a very cool place for dinner.    Dinners are fabulous but breakfast is awesome too, and you can't pass up that make your own bloody mary bar.  Some things that are awesome: - The mussels, with chorizo.  SO good - Asian pear and endive salad  - Orange and ginger seared ahi - Grilled lamb sausage  - Caprese salad - the tomatoes are sooo good and fresh - Ho-J: This is on their breakfast menu and is basically an orangecicle smoothy.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and ice cream.    If I was a local, I'd be going here all the time.  Knowing that the ingredients are local and many are organic and that most everything is made from scratch just makes you feel better about the choice of eating there.",

I can't count how many times I've done that.  Had the chicken picatta, which was excellent. Others had the chicken and penne, stroganoff, and ribeye. Prices are a little steep (about 20 bucks on average), but they are typical for a resort restaurant. Excellent service--she even cracked a joke (on me!).  The lounge area is great and the bartenders enjoyable. We went to the lounge bar before dinner and for a night cap every night we stayed at the Ho.  Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I had a wonderful time at Cafe Zulu, which is located within the Hotel Valley Ho. I think the 'Cafe' part throws me off tho, because I feel it's more of a lounge/bar with very mod-esque decor; something that reminds you of a scene out of The Jetsons.  They have a great happy hour menu that lists a range of appetizers from Bruschetta, Prime rib dip w/au jus, to a handful of signature drinks and domestic beers for only $3 a piece. It's a great deal!  The Chef who works for the Valley Ho and who happened to be creating these tasty appetizers, came out and introduce himself asked if everything tasted good and if he could do anything for us, while our waitress was very cool and insightful on the drinks and appetizers as well. Now that's what I call great service. You can't beat a $3 happy hour menu",

    "text": "How fantastic is this restaurant!? I guess you're reading this review to find out. Let me tell you, it's the most fantastic-est ever! Hotel Valley Ho describes itself as  \"mid-century modern\" and \"urban,\" which you'll agree with once you experience the wonderful architecture, furnishings, and brilliant colors all about. ZuZu is no exception to the theme. From their bar to their patio umbrellas to their coffee mugs, you'll fall in love with the warm, retro vibe going on.   Now this menu isn't cheap, but it isn't crazy pricey either. They feature fresh and local produce when possible, and the menu revolves around classic American favorites \"with a modern twist.\" You'll find everything from gourmet sandwiches, to burgers, to beef stroganoff, to filet mignon, to casseroles. Great wine menu as well, in addition to classic and original cocktails. The breakfast menu is equally as phenomenal with gorgeous omelets, pancakes, french toast, salmon and more.   Let me tell you about what I ordered. For breakfast, I went with the gluten free french toast which was 100% incredible. It's stuffed with lemon cream-cheese (just a hint of lemon, nothing crazy) and topped with fresh berries and maple syrup. Good god. It was breathtaking! I also had a mushroom omelet which was stuffed with spinach and sharp cheddar cheese... can't go wrong there. I had GF toast on the side with ZuZu's house made apricot jelly. Delish. For dinner, I enjoyed the roasted spaghetti squash. Don't knock it til you try it... Have you ever had spaghetti squash? It's amazing and served atop braised greens, tomatoes, and covered in a Parmesan crust and toasted pine nuts. Does that not sound like perfection? Because it is.  Make sure you come in the evening and sit outside by the enormous fire. There are plenty of couches and the service here at ZuZu is outstanding. Don't miss out!",

I was so happy to be able to try out their menu and some of my favorites were the lobster risotto, Scottish salmon the Show Stopper shake and the Ho-nut on the dessert menu. Their signature cocktails are creative and always diverse, there is something for everyone. I really enjoy that the menu is classified into different options now for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner. I'm excited to see where this restaurant goes and also to try all the delicious creations ahead. If you have ever tried cafe zuzu before the last 5 months and were disappointed, you should definitely come back and give it a second shot! You will not regret it!",

We came here for my friends Birthday. Our food was magnificent, the service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was so cool it was hot!   Love this place. If I could eat here once a week I would. They even Valet your car. Love it!  All 4 of us loved our drinks. A gorgeous mint Lemonade, I was served Green Tea that was almost too beautiful to try. Plus, it was a great day outside. We dined inside but, they had the Patio open and it was wonderful. Since it was my friends Birthday, they treated him to a wonderful Chocolate Pie! It was so Good. We ordered one as well.

    "text": "As if the Valley Ho wasn't great enough, they had to go ahead and slap on one of the best restaurants I've ever seen attached to a hotel. ZuZu made my stay even better, and I found myself sitting in the colorful, swanky lounge quite a few times.   Service is so friendly and fast, and the server we had both mornings I had breakfast there could not have been better. Coffee comes out right away and is strong and flavorful, and they have a ton of other drink options. You can get a latte or espresso, and they even have a drink made by blending OJ with ice cream. I was trying to be \"good\" on this trip or I would have indulged in that last one...  My favorite menu item for breakfast is the garden veggie omelet, complete with oven roasted tomatoes, squash, basil, and goat cheese. I added spinach, and subbed tomatoes and avocado for the potatoes (although those damn potatoes are amazing.) The second time I had breakfast over there, I tried the eggs benedict, which was some of the best I've ever had.   I also had some menu items sent to my room a couple of times, and can't rave about them enough. The beet salad gets five stars, the guacamole gets five stars, and so does the cheese plate... which officially earned the title of 'best cheese plate of all time.' If you don't believe me, take a look at my photos.  Fantastic drink list, fun atmosphere, GREAT food, and wonderful service. ZuZu made leaving the Valley Ho more painful than it already was!",

First experience, totally ignored after being seated but table next to us had drinks before we were acknowledged. Drinks were forgotten then partially served. Then finally received the food which was great!  Had to ask for service, silverware, cleared our own plates, asked to have the order taken 2x manager noticed it (after we cleared) and helped but didn't say a darn thing.",

They have organic preserves which were yummy. Scones which they serve to the table for free were on point and good. They have a version of orange julius which you should order.  That being said the burgers had to be sent back because they were all well done not medium rare as ordered. Even after replacement the burgers were blah. To there credit the burgers were all free.  Service is the reason for 3 stars. They refused to split the check for 9 people on a business lunch. This overally complicated the check out process, the waitress not knowing how to proceed just decided to split the check evenly between us all without our consent to do so. This checkout process took a total of 45 minutes. Most infuriating though was after telling the waitress we were now running late for work she took 20 minutes to run 6 credit cards.  Overall food was hit or miss. When hit it was orgasmic. When missed it was edible which cost them one star. Next star for: Service needs to improve and basically ruined our experience. Message to manager: consider upgrading to a technology that allows you to split the check like Denny's or iHOP or plug in your restaurant.",

The kids lunch menu is prefect and well made! The staff is also very nice and accommodating",

I was a regular at Trader Vic's before they closed. This was my first experience at ZuZu. I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner over a Moscow Mule and their popular ZuZu burger. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I love the outdoor seating area and the inside modern decor is just as amazing with all the colors and uniqueness it brings.",

First courses -- Wagyu Beef was perfectly tender and flavorful. The roasted acorn squash soup was excellent as well, with the cinnamon toasted marshmallows an awesome creative twist.   We both had the mustard crusted NY strip -- tender and tasty, but the star for me was the truffle mashed potatoes.   The Decadent Chocolate Torte was in fact decadent, an excellent end to an excellent meal.   My only suggestion is they need to up their game on the dinner rolls, but that was a minor infraction. All in all, a beautiful and romantic setting for a terrific meal.",

The decor of the hotel and restaurant is fun - very retro - so the experience was good from the get-go. The food was fabulous. Can you believe a bottomless basket of delicious scones?? My daughter ordered the California Benedict and loved it. I ignored calories and got the stuffed French toast, stuffed with lemon cream cheese and berries. Yum! No butter or syrup needed.   On top of all of this good food, we decided to try a Frosty Ho-Jay. Wow! I will be ordering this again, but not when eating French toast.  Too many sweets. I wouldn't mind stopping by just to have a Frosty Ho-Jay on its own. It's like a creamcicle milkshake.  We will definitely be back and we will insist that any guests we have come along too.",

Back to the 70's to a simpler time, when life was beautiful all the time!    I loved the retro styling of this hotel!  It was intentional retro, not worn out dated retro.  The furnishings in Cafe ZuZu reminded me of the Jetsons!  But the ambiance reminded me of old time Hollywood.  I half expected Frank Sinatra to sit down next to me and sing me a song.  I was there to meet my new friend Gabi for lunch, and I must say, we had a wonderful time.  I had read up on Cafe ZuZu before going so I had kind of an idea of what to look for.   And I wanted to say that I was confused about some of the mixed reviews because being a foodie who is almost fanatical about fresh food and clean comfortable surroundings, I was very impressed.  The restaurant was very clean.  Someone before had mentioned stains on booths, etc.  There was no such thing anywhere I could see.  The booth was clean and comfortable.  There were no crumbs, sticky spots, or fingerprints anywhere!  Very relaxing!  The servers were right on top of things too!  Very friendly and helpful.  I was a little early and they didn't make me wait until my party got there.  I hate that when restaurants do that.  They let me sit, they served me, and they were very gracious.  Gabi got there shortly and we were quickly served.  We both decided on the Ahi Tuna salad and boy was it fabulous!  Fresh ahi, lightly seared on the edges, perfect pink in the inside.  It was so delicious it melted in my mouth.  The greens were fresh too, just like they were just picked, and the dressing was just right.  Perfect for the tuna.  I loved this salad, and I am very picky about Ahi.  I also was impressed by the rolls that they served.  They were not hot, I'm not sure if they were supposed to be, but they were yeasty, fresh and melted in my mouth too.  I noticed that the tops of them were browned and salted like a fresh pretzel.  It made for a very enjoyable roll.  I would have eaten all of them, but I was trying to be polite!  :)  Well I wouldn't have eaten quite ALL of them!  I think the only thing you should be aware of is that there is no off-street parking, you need to valet park.  The valet's were friendly and fast.  But if you're not comfortable with valet parking, prepare to walk around the block or across a busy street.  We loved our lunch and Cafe ZuZu and would highly recommend it.  It's a must see stop on a trip to Scottsdale, or just for a great lunch in Old Town!    Enjoy!",

But, it is worth checking out. I have heard wonderful things about the mac n' cheese, burgers and other items. And this was my one and only experience there while staying at the hotel.

    "text": "I have frequented ZuZu numerous times for dinner with family or friends and never walked away disappointed. While the food is essentially simple it tends to be very well done as you would expect for the price.   The iceberg lettuce wedge salad was absolutely ridiculously big, I suggest splitting it unless you plan on grazing for awhile. The grilled salmon, ahi tuna salad, and beef stroganoff have all been proven to be consistent palette pleasers and the Bourbon Mac Daddy from the bar was perfect. Dinner service has always been prompt and friendly but not intrusive. Obviously, a booth is quite nice for a small party or a couple on a date, they are relatively cozy, somewhat quieter than the main floor, and have excellent lighting. The decor is relatively contemporary, as you would expect in Scottsdale/Valley Ho with a sprinkle of Frank Loyd Wright's influence in the central columns, but largely has a very relaxed and warm feeling. As a springtime alternative they also have a wonderful outdoor patio.  ZuZu is quite popular on Friday and Saturday nights thus if possible I strongly recommend reservations or trying to go on off peak days for a more enjoyable dining experience. If you do decide to pop in at the last minute and are faced with a consequential wait there is a very relaxed bar adjacent to ZuZu in the lobby of the Valley Ho which you could easily pass the time.

So I was taken along to Zuzu, located inside the Hotel Valley Ho, which I am warned is \"retro.\" This is, in fact, the truth as the hotel looks like something out of an episode of Scooby Doo and the hotel like a malt shop where those meddling teens hang out.  Except, of course, for the full bar and menu serving more than malts.  We ended up there for brunch, where I tried the mushroom and bacon omelette, which featured fried onions and cream cheese. This arrived on a plate with toast of my choosing and potatoes. The omelette was good, save for very little cream cheese, and ketchup/jam didn't show up until 2/3 through the meal (a bit annoying). The jam needed pectin, as it was exceptionally soupy, and not very tasty (an apricot marmalade was the best I could identify).  It was not busy at all there, so the staff were very attentive. Overall, I'd go back, and probably branch out more into the menu before I rated this any higher.",

We decided to ring in Friday with lunch outside the office at Cafe ZuZu. I thought the menu offered a large selection of items from chili and salad to sandwiches and burgers. Prior to ordering, the waitress brought over a basket of rolls (or buns as we say in Canadian). They were a slightly sweet eggy bread that melted in my mouth. I decided to try the Seared Ahi Salad with an Asian dressing. The Ahi was prepared perfectly, slightly seared on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was presented on a bed of spinach, with yellow peppers and sliced onions - delicious! My coworkers all tried something different: Salmon Salad, Border Chili (which looked incredible), and the half sandwich with soup. From their response it sounded like the Border Chili was the ticket!  I was pretty impressed with my overall experience and will be back for cocktail hour! I give Cafe ZuZu four stars.",

    "text": "Gonna have to rain on the breakfast parade a little bit, I'm afraid.  I'm on an unofficial mission to try all the great or very good or excellent breakfast joints in the Phoenix area.  On my Yelp search for a Sunday breakfast, I hit on Cafe ZuZu and decided to give it a try.  I wish I hadn't done that.  $27 later, I couldn't wait to get home to eat after the meal.  In order and succinctly:  Spicy Bloody Mary - decent tasting, albeit not very SPICY at all.  Came with a full stalk of celery, a wedge of lime AND lemon, and two olives. Problem:  it was MOSTLY ICE.  I got about 6-7 good pulls on the straw and it was empty.  And there sat a full glass of ice, stuffed in the glass top to bottom.  Look - I know MOST places do this, and at times I have even asked for NO ICE in my Bloody Mary.  I guess I'm going to have to make that a solid habit.  I don't like getting so obviously ripped off.  I work hard for my money, and I don't appreciate having to pay $6.50 for 75 cents worth of Bloody Mary contents.  Side of Thick Cut Virginia Bacon - very nice taste, cooked about right.  This was the highlight of the meal.  Breakfast Casserole - my SORE point, even more-so than the Bloody Mary.  It was advertised in the menu as this: \"sweet Italian sausage, roasted potatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes + cheddar, topped with a poached egg (or substitute sour cream for egg)\"  All that WAS True.  But here's the MAJOR PROBLEM:  the amount of \"sweet Italian sausage\" was about the size of two quarters.  I'm not kidding.  There were 4 thinly sliced slivers of sausage, about the thickness and size of half a quarter dollar each.  That was it for the sausage.  The dish was SMALL too, about the size of my hand and not much thicker.  It was mostly green, red, and yellow bell pepper.  Mushrooms were good, what there were of them. The roasted potatoes portion consisted of about 3 medium-sized potato wedges.  Here's how they made it:  Cut all the veggies,add the two tiny slices of sausage, and cover it with cheddar.  Nuke, then add a poached egg on top.  It was something I could make at my house, but never would, because there was no seasonings involved.  Just the ingredients, smothered with melted cheddar.  Not creative, and not very tasty at ALL.  Felt ripped off at $11.75.  Ambiance and setting was good. The facility is nice.  The service was good.  The food and the lack of value are what ruined this meal.  But if you can't bring me some tasty. memorable (in a GOOD way) food, then I'm not going to be coming back.",

    "text": "My friend and I ate dinner here the first night of our stay at Hotel Valley Ho. Our server, Mare, was very sweet and helpful and didn't interrupt our meal, but still made sure we had everything we needed. The fresh, hot rolls served beforehand were delicious and my bacon cheeseburger was great. The bacon was thick cut and crunchy, just the way I like it. My friend's truffled grilled cheese was decent, not exactly what I usually look for in a grilled cheese (not very melty or grilled, and not a whole lot of gooey cheese) but it was a fresh alternative to a burger. We had a salad (mediocre) a few nights later and the mixed drinks were the same, at best. It was nice sitting outside once the sun went down and listened to the Beatles and Sinatra as we listened to the poolside's last stragglers of the evening.",

We've had our fair share of excellent brunches, so I was cautiously excited when I saw the menu which included toffee pancakes. Zuzu's food exceeded my expectations. First, they bring a variety of fresh scones to the table. They were delicious and could have almost been a brunch themselves. Our table also got both of the eggs Benedicts, an omelet,  and the toffee panackes. The pancakes were out of this world... must try! In addition to the yummy food, the hotel is pretty cool. Only annoyance was parking - it's easiest to just valet. The fee is free but need to tip.",

But they go over the top w/ some of their entree's.......I think they need to study the menu from Eddie \"V\"'s, \"Paul Martin's\" and \"Bandera\". Hello Prime-Dip's? But no Prime-Rib on the menu? They need to do some 60's classic's. For instance The \"Wedge of Lettuce\" w/ Blue Cheese. The Hotel is Retro, how bout Retro entrees???? \"Rack of Lamb\" Now how hard is that? Main-Stream soups........The soup's are ALWAY's to over the edge! How about Shrimp-Scampi ?

Very friendly and prompt service with a breakfast menu that has something for everyone. I chose the coconut chia seed pudding to try something need and it was delicious.

Notably fewer gluten-free options on the menu now for some reason. Although, I will say they do try their best to accommodate when they can. Today my BLT on gluten-free bread was OK but not great like it always is. The bacon seemed like it was cold and pre-cooked. The avocado was hard and tasteless. The tomato was completely mushy. In fact, the avocado and tomato were so bad that I had to take them off the sandwich. My lunch mate got the pork belly mac & cheese which sounded great, but it was so overly rich she couldn't eat more than a few bites. The place was beautiful and comfortable as always, but the food is just not up to par anymore. Disappointing.",

    "text": "I have frequented ZuZu a lot over the past couple of years, but my experience last night was very disappointing.    I tend to meet there with a group of ladies (5 or 6 ladies minimum up to 10 or so) on a semi-regular basis.  Last month, when I made reservations, I was told I didn't need them if we were eating/drinking from the Happy Hour menu.    We typically order off of the Happy Hour menu, and I've never had a situation where this has been an issue.  Last night, when I arrived, I asked for a table for 6 and was told if we were eating off of the Happy Hour menu, we could sit in the lounge chairs by the bar or the cocktail tables outside.  It's 100+ degrees these days; so, we pushed some tables together and made do with the lounge area though the regular seating area was dead.  This was irritating but nothing to complain about or to bring attention to.  Our server, however, was rude.  We ordered fries, which she forgot to bring with our meal and we had to follow up about.  They were SO SALTY that I wish we didn't order them.  Another lady ordered a coke, which didn't arrive and she had to ask for again.  There was no apology for the mishap with the Coke.    We had 6 people, but one of the ladies in our group had her drinks paid for by her husband who was at a different table.  Technically, this left us with 5 ladies/5 tabs, which she gave us an attitude about when we asked if we could split our tabs.  She did (begrudgingly) split our tickets, but the tickets had an error on them and had to be corrected.  We were charged for a Chardonnay instead of the Coke.  The gratuity was charged twice on another ticket.  It was avoidable mistakes, which should have been caught.  Overall, the level of mistakes and the attitude from our server left a sour taste in my mouth.  I usually really enjoy my experience here but will remember this next time I am looking for a night out with some girls.",

But last week when we stayed at Hotel Valley Ho and ate at ZuZu's (once for dinner, once for breakfast) it was not amazing.   Our waitress talked to us in a very condescending manner--she was much older, and it felt like she was talking down to me and my husband because of our age (we're in our 20s, and have been treated poorly at nicer places before in and around Scottsdale). It was super bizarre, and after dinner, I finally asked my husband if he felt the same way. Sure enough, he did. Next morning, a different waitress is rude and doesn't even offer to bring us coffee when we sit down. We had to ask her for coffee when she wanted to take our breakfast order.   Don't get me wrong, ZuZu's is definitely worth checking out if you are in the area or if you are staying at Hotel Valley Ho! I mean, the vintage-meets-modern decor drawn from the original property is so lovely and rich with history, and the menu is great with delicious food!",

    "text": "It's a little off. Everything you think should be familiar and delicious, has a little mediocre twist on it.  I've had two seeming easy to execute meals that turned out not quite right.   First: a rib eye. How could this possibly be messed up? Easy... it's flap meat. What's that? The fatty part of the rib eye. I personally think they cooked a flat iron by mistake and told me that to avoid cooking what I actually ordered. Paying $6 for a side of mashed potatoes is kind of gratuitous   Second is probably the most egregious, over cooking the eggs on my eggs Benedict. Hard as rocks and almost no Hollandaise sauce. Dry as a bone.  The breakfast potatoes were inedible due to paprika over use.   Service was friendly.  Atmosphere is fun and fancy.   I also had a version of a Moscow mule which was delicious.   The appetizers that we tried were a cheese plate, which had good cheeses. But also we had a sausage plate, which had some gross and grainy sausage.",

    "text": "I'm not going to lie the original reason for going was the Showstopper shake I saw on instagram (basic I know), and I left with an overall great experience which has kept me coming back. The menu changes seasonal which makes it desirable to go back because you will experience different dishes throughout the year. I like the atmosphere because the inside is very retro mod style of furniture and decor. If it isn't million degrees out the patio seating is almost nice at night.   So let's dive into the food. This last time I went I shared four different appetizers, and I'm glad I did!  The first one was the baked brie. I have had this in the past so I know I like it a lot, I'm a huge cheese fan. The cheese wasn't melted except for the very edges, so a little disappointing but over the caramel with with almonds is awesome on top. We did have to request another piece of bread because it only came with one which is fine the server was really helpful and it didn't cost anything extra.  Next was the short rib \"tater tots\" a total 10/10. The tater portion was smashed potatoes with the short rib mixed. The horseradish aioli was a perfect complement to tie it all together.  The third appetizer we had was the pork belly mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was really good. A nice balance of cheesy, crunchy, and savory. The pork belly is cooked to perfection and everything just kind of melts in your mouth.  The last and possibly my favorite one we had was the organic maktoom dates. I ordered it because it said bacon wrapped and I was not let down. These flavors I wouldn't have expected to have gone so well together they are rich but delish! Would be my pick to recommend for someone.",

My boyfriend and I opted for the 4 course meal they offered for this occasion.  He ordered Glenlivet neat and I had a glass of cabernet. Drinks were not included with the 4 course meal.   The first course was pretty good. We chose the Charcuterie + Antipasti. The chicken liver with PB&J was interesting. For the final 3 courses, we got one of each item so we could try/share (there were only 2 options per course).   Soup and salad in course 2 were fine. Nothing spectacular. Desserts in the final course were delicious - can't go wrong with something chocolatey & creme brulee.  The third course... sigh. The bacon wrapped filet was YUMMY. The baked lobster carbonara...MEH. This entree was so bland and underwhelming. Just no flavor whatsoever. Not sure I even spied any lobster in it, but I took a few bites & was stuffed. The sauce was pretty heavy. I didn't even have the room in me to have a 2nd piece of the filet my BF offered .  Anyway, I guess for $65 per person it wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. We may return to ZuZu to try some items from their regular menu. Oh, there was some live music near the bar as we were heading out and they were great!",

Every bite is chock full of the cheese, grilled onions and bacon and the brioche bun was also a great fit. Another person just subbed the blue for cheddar and also enjoyed her \"normal, not famous\" burger. On this day, the chips outclassed the upcharged fries, but not by a huge margin. You can still get a free dessert with check-in, but no cheesecake was available this visit. The strawberry shake was more milky than ice creamy, but still refreshing and free. Will be back more often now when in the burger mood.",

    "text": "It's a hotel bar, so you might not even need to read the review. This is a complex 3-star rating.   This place is a bit different than the regular hotel bars that people in Arcadia/N.Scottsdale seem to frequent. Mid-century modern architecture is nice to look at, and I could tell my girlfriend liked being in a fancier place for once.   The happy hour is pretty great. And by great, I mean it moves the restaurant fare into an affordable hemisphere. Drinks become less than ten dollars and you can get some grilled vegetables for about six bucks more. Anything beyond appetizers will set you back dearly, but the cooking staff seemed to be competent (even though I wouldn't know, I only had some grilled veggies.)   The hotel does a little wine-tasting/chef meeting event that costs about 60 bucks per person but would be really cool for people looking to do more than just pay out the nose for drinks and a steak elsewhere.   This place lost a star for the (can't believe I'm going to say this) behavior of the wait staff. I heard more than a few of the people talking shit about customers seated outside or at the other end of the bar, and chatting about their personal lives with each other. I'm all about hating on dress codes and regulations at work, but you should know if the place you work at charges twelve bucks for a cocktail, a little more is expected of you.   The bar has TV's but they are very poorly placed, just part of the difficulty of transforming an older spot into a newer attraction I suppose.   If you aren't staying at the hotel, there are plenty of places I'd rather hit in the area.",

Everything was delicious from the coffee to the farm fresh eggs, yummy bacon which could NOT have been more perfectly cooked and delicious sourdough. A lot of their ingredients are locally sourced so my brekkie was really a delicious conglomeration of all the goodness Arizona has to offer. What made this brekkie out of this world however was the Frosty Ho-Jay which is fresh squeezed Orange Juice blended with Vanilla gellato. I swear, my eyes almost rolled back in my head it was THAT good. Orange Julius can kiss my ass after this cosmic experience. Fantastic. I highly recommend Cafe Zuzu...if nothing else DO NOT leave until you've had the Frosty Ho-Jay. I can't believe I enjoyed a drink that much that had no alcohol in it.",

    "text": "This hotel restaurant is a terrific example of how Yelp can synthesize with an invested business and promote a great experience. ZuZu is a gem. Fantastic retro style, unique culinary approach, fresh food, good service and a relaxed, casual atmosphere for evening dining. It's clear from other reviews that management is invested in keeping it that way, something I love to see. It's important to know that people are listening to the customer base.  I checked in on a Friday night and received a complementary glass of Pinot Noir that paired nicely with one of the specials, fish and chips. Five battered nuggets of white fish nestled themselves next to an inspired take on tartar sauce: fresh cabbage and light cream sauce, nothing thick or mayo-ish. Fries came separately in a lined basket accompanied by a delicious red chile dipping sauce and good old ketchup. Nothing too greasy, which is usually the issue with this dish, I loved it.  I'll be back in October, and I'm looking forward to the much lauded breakfast. Great to know that the fantastic accommodations of the hotel are backed up by a seriously unique and enjoyable dining establishment. Cheers!",

Everything was delicious and of the appropriate temperature upon arrival... Visited the Bar for a night cap a couple nights of our stay and could not say anything better about all the staff at this joint!  They had a fantastic Reggae Band playing on Sunday which made the Ho pool experience exponentially more romantic then usual...   Should have liked to enjoy some of the 24 hour room service that was available but we had so much fun out on the town that we did not get to take advantage of this feature!!!  Note that the Yelp check in offer of:  Free Desert w Dinner Entree,  will not be honored for room service orders because that would be an unquestionable waste of good will...  Lame sauce!",

    "text": "I am beyond excited to be writing about ZuZu for my inaugural Yelp review!  Ok, maybe I'm late to the party on this one, but what a great little surprise to find in Scottsdale! It's at the Valley Ho which makes you feel somewhat cliche, retro and chic to even be there.    The bar area is a great place to hang out, grab a drink after work and watch all of the characters of Scottsdale parading through.  I went on a Monday night and it was very quiet, but I can imagine how it picks up on the weekends with the pool scene.    Here's the rundown...  Happy Hour... great deals on food and drinks and it goes until 7pm!  It's rare these days to find a HH that goes until 7pm, so I'm already a fan.  Service... our waiter was great and the perfect mix of helpful, funny, but not overbearing.  I always appreciate a waiter who gives honest opinions of menu items and doesn't just say he loves it all.  He was very personable and happy to let us just hang out and take our time.   Food... Truffle Fries - great but won't change your life...it's a great snack to share with the table but don't jeopardize another decision for the truffle fries.    Grilled Cheese - delish!  It comes with truffle, arugula and roasted tomatoes so it isn't your classic grilled cheese.  The arugula flavor was a little overwhelming but I'm also not the biggest arugula fan.  The grilled cheese is cut into 3 cute little pieces so it's perfect for sharing with the table if you don't want to fully commit.  Mussels - great and definitely worth ordering!  The mussels are extra large so you don't get as many pieces as usual.  The broth is unique with a coconut curry flavor and perfectly toasted bread for dipping.    Kale Salad - moved into my top 3 in phoenix!  I'm a big fan of kale salads and I've tried them all.  This kale salad falls in line after LGO and True Food.  It has pears, roasted tomatoes and bread crumbs to add the perfect finishing touch.    I hope this helps guide you a little and avoid menu anxiety at ZuZu! The rest of the menu looks equally amazing but I didn't have the space to try it all.  I'm looking forward to going back for brunch very soon to try the bloody mary bar and red velvet waffles!",

The food was good; however, I wasn't completely blown away. The omelette and everything in it taste very fresh (not sure of this place is farm to table). However the red velvet waffle was mediocre. The creme on top was a little off. Needless to say, the experience was great and I definitely recommend eating here.",

They have now changed it yet again, doubled in prices, and the selections were unworthy.    Not sure why they always try to fix what is not broken.  Please bring back the Chicken Drumettes with the honey bourbon sauce, the Artisan Grilled Cheese with the brie and fig jam, and The Prime Rib Dip which was to die for.",

    "text": "We stayed here for a staycation and it just happened to be restaurant week as well. We had a great time at the pool. The staff was pretty rude by the pool though. They close about 6. They give you no heads up or last call so when we asked for another drink, the server actually said...\"you can try the bar if you want\". Cool, thanks...is that where you get drinks? Im in the pool. We went upstairs, showered and changed. The room was very nice and clean but a little confusing to find...again, we ran into a staff member who had no idea where to tell us how to get to our room.  We found the complete opposite with our service at dinner. Service was fantastic! I didnt like what I ordered which was a smoked fried chicken but my dates liked the flavor of the steak but said it was a little tough. If I noticed someone wasnt eating their meal, I would've asked to get them something else but she did not so I just didn't eat. Included was an appetizer of some sort ( obviously forgettable) and a dessert of lemon tart and a lava cake which we all enjoyed. VH is only a couple miles from my house so I ended up just coming home. The other 2 friends stayed and we opted out of the pool the next day, which is an option, but the service by the pool left a bad taste in our mouth. Not really interested in giving this place my money again but I dont have to with all the local resorts having summer specials.",

We got the Short rib hash and florentine frittata, both of which were seriously yummy! Their breakfast quesadilla is our usual favorite, but we went outside the box and tried new yummy things. I can't think of anything I've had that isn't good, but I also know that they'll gladly exchange something if you don't like it.   Love their Build your own Bloody Bar on the weekend! $5, you choose your liquor, and them build away! Delicious and a fun experience :)   We've also done their happy hour here - $3 champagne! $5 food! Fun crowd! One of my favorite different happy hours in town.   They offer a Monday night Chefs Table once a month as well. Although the price seems steep at first, it's a really neat experience. For $52 (the last time we did it) a person, you get a four-course meal, designed around the featured winery or brewery for the month. Representatives from the winery tell you about the wines you'll be having, and Chef Wiley and Chef Sean explain the food choices as well all in all, an intimate exclusive feeling night.   I've recommended Cafe Zuzu to a lot of people from out of town, and they just plain don't disappoint.",

While the mayem and madness of putting together a fashion show unraveled in our room, I sought refuge on our private patio with my new friend (the burger) and it's sidekick (homemade chips!)....I devoured and enjoyed each morsel. The bread was soft and crispy on the edges! Heavenly I say. The signage for Zu Zu is a little Weird Weird...I thought it was Trader Vic's as I saw two signs for TV and none for ZZ! Didn't care, the decor was warm and modern with big puffy cotton ball lighting dotting the ceiling. Hostess and bartender were warm and modern with big puffy cotton balls...oh, wait...I digress...edit...the manager put together my order with a minor mislabeling of medium well and medium rare. Sorry Rickie...I know you don't like the pink spot. Hey. Clean it up yelpitas. I liked the menu I perused while waiting for my chow, enjoyed the decor and service...Cafe Zu Zu easily gets two, two thumbs up I say...Up Up!",

All the apps are a good deal and most are very tasty - the only one I wasn't fond of was the terribly over-salted chicken wings. The cocktails aren't weak like you'd expect for $3, and the wine selection is decent. The beers are the only thing that aren't a good deal, in my opinion - you can find domestics for $3 at many places even when it's not happy hour. After a long day or work (or play), you really will be happy after an hour at ZuZu.",

I turned 40 for the first time (after many years of celebrating my 39th birthday, it's time to move on and \"grow up\":) Cafe ZuZu is the in house restaurant at Valley Ho and a genuine bright spot in an already terrific hotel experience.  ZuZu is named after the little girl in \"It's A Wonderful Life\", the movie that's on TV 2-3 dozen times each Christmas.  What that has to do with the restaurant is unclear, but they had to name it something, and ZuZu works for me:) I think we all know that hotel restaurants can be an \"uneven\" experience, but that's not the case with little ZuZu:) We have eaten at ZuZu's before, over the years and always found the food and service to be very good and very reasonably priced (esp. for a hotel restaurant, where the prices and service often reflect the fact that they think you are captive to their $15 tuna sandwiches and their $20 omelets). ZuZu's is reasonably priced and they serve a great meal! This visit, I had a BLT with an over easy egg on it...I didn't really think you could improve on a decent BLT...I stand corrected! This sandwich has a touch of genius! I also tried their truffled grilled cheese and club sandwiches...wonderfully made...fresh tasting ingredients and great bread, well prepared eaten poolside with a couple of martini's...now that's what I call a hearty breakfast:) Fresh cut fries and fresh house made potato chips are a great accompaniment to the meals. The menus are creative and I have yet to have an unhappy experience at ZuZu. Whether you sit inside at ZuZu and listen to Frank, Tony and rest crooning along like it's 1960 again, or have your lunch at the pool and listen to Pearl Jam, Priest and the Boss, ZuZu is a good time:)",

Not cool: Furniture that is so dirty it actually LOOKS like it's from the 60s and has been sitting in my parent's basement for two decades. Cafe Zuzu -- clean your freaking booths.  The first thing I noticed after sitting down here this morning was that the brown polyester upholstery on my chair was stained with -- milk? And then, looking around,  I noticed the walls of many of the booths (same fabric) were also stained. The carpets were full of crumbs and food, too. That's what I expect from I-Hop, not the Valley Ho.  My husband and I ate here for Easter brunch, but were overall disappointed. The menu? boring. The prices? OK, but a bit high for what you're getting. The service? Slow. The decor? Very cool. I'll admit, I enjoyed sitting in the cafe with glass walls that were open to the pool and the cool decorations. But that was about it. The menu was all things like \"Denver omelet\" \"bacon and mushroom omelet\" \"scrambled eggs with grits\" \"pancakes\" -- what is this, a breakfast join in Fargo or something? Really, that's the best you can do?  I really wanted french toast, but the only option Zuzu offered was \"cranberry and walnut\" - which seemed a little seasonal. As in, NOT the springtime season. So I settled for the eggs and grits. The grits were really good. The eggs were... well... scrambled eggs. They were fine, and all, pretty tasty -- but that's it.  I guess I just expected something more.  I was under the impression that this place was supposed to put a  \"twist\" on the typical \"comfort foods\" -- but they seemed to forget to add the twist. I could have had a far more creative brunch at home.",

My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata.  The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum.  After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again.",

Sat down in the lobby bar and fired up the Mac. We were thrilled to find favorites on the wine list and more excited when the cheese plate we ordered arrived at our table. Great cheeses with fresh breads, fruits and a sweet spread that topped it off. Our favorite cheese plate in town right now.",

The cinnamon roll and fresh berries are amazing. They also have a fabulous fresh scone on Sunday with cherries and chocolate inside. My husband likes the ZuZu breakfast casserole. Definitely a place everyone should try!",

    "text": "First off, the ambiance is Mid-Century chic and inviting. We  had been here before and liked it so this time, we just stopped in for breakfast during  the week. We were not guests at hotel. We were seated, looked over the menu, made our selection and waited for someone to take our order. And waited. And waited. It was not busy, but it seemed short staffed. My friend approached the hostess to tell her we were ready to order. Hostess was polite and got a waitress to come to our table. The woman who showed up was rude and made no eye contact. Really bad attitude. When meal arrived, eggs were dry and on the cold side, \"toast\" was not toasted, just warm bread. We asked for toast to be toasted. The waitress said she would get another serving. Again, no toast, just warm bread. Belgian waffle seemed like a frozen waffle. Overall, an unpleasant experience with mediocre food and very rude service. Will not go back to eat there.",

It was a tad on the pricey side probably because it's in a hotel, but the food and coffee were delicious with generous portions. The service was wonderful. Hubby had the lemon cream cheese stuffed brioche French toast and I had an omelet stuffed with broccolini, carmelized onions and roasted tomatoes with a side of bacon. It was one of those meals that had us practically moaning with every bite 'cause it was so tasty! Oh yeah, free valet parking!",

After being seated we waited for about fifteen (no joke) minuted when our server arrived with water. She took our drink order. We never saw her again!!! after some twenty minutes (no joking again).....we gave up and walked out! During all this we observed that the 30ish other guest seated outside also seemed to be experiencing similar (better or worst) than our table.  I can dine anywhere i like....(money is not an issue) you can can deliver a marginal mean and great service and i can forgive. If, however, you have the best food ever BUT no service, you are dead in the water!!!

    "text": "Went there last night for dinner with a group of girls.  When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.  Clientele was what was expected & typical for that part of Scottsdale - at the bar were a bunch of \"brah's\" who like to act like they have money and their respective female counterparts.  Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.  Instead, it was a 50-something-year-old woman with no social skills. The food was also pretty gnarly.  We ordered probably 6 or 7 appetizers before we ordered meals.  I only tried a couple of them - specifically the \"warm maytag blue cheese fondue\" with potato chips.  ICK.  The dip was horrendous tasting and looked like what my husband calls a \"wax dart\" if he hasn't, you know, for a while.  The chips were really greasy and just tasted like a potato dipped in oil.  I also tried the \"oven roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole\" with herb toast.  Another ick.  The toast was alright, but the casserole was like bruschetta gone wrong.  I ordered the \"Grilled Chicken Piccata\" with the butter sauce on the side.  It was alright - way too much salt and the seasonings tasted off.    I don't know, perhaps I went there with the wrong expectations.  I thought the atmosphere wouldn't be as cheesy and I expected to eat \"comfort food\", not food I wanted to secretly spit into my napkin.  I'll never go back.",

When we arrived they booked us as a reservation under the Sands Buffet and were pushy in convincing us to go there. After refusing they finally allowed us to seat at zuzu, which I don't know why was a problem bc it clearly looked like there was space for us at zuzu.  2) The waiter brought out coffee and juice and spilled it on my cousin.. then after waiting forever for the mimosas and bloody Marys the we ordered, he spilled mimosa all over my friend's cashmere sweater.   3) Items from our order were missing, incorrect, or took forever to get. We were never offered refills on coffee or water unless we specifically asked for it.   4) I agree with other users the food was a hit or miss. My cousin had the best meal out of all of us dining.... he had a lox bagel, kinda hard to mess up. But everyone had said that the best part of their meal was the toast.  Also, I got the pork chilequile special and they basically dumped sauce on top of a tortilla chip and added an over easy egg, there was no evidence of pork at all so I politely sent that back. By the time I got a new entree I just had them box it up bc everyone else in my party had already finished whatever they could stomach from their meal that was not awful.   5) Instead of serving us the waiter was too lazy to walk around and place drinks or meals in front of us. He literally was on the other side of the table and reached across the table to give me my entree which I had to grab myself from across the table.  My family and I had Christmas brunch here in 2015 and we loved it so much that we decided to make a tradition out of it. After our experience this Christmas brunch we will definitely not be back.  Some of these issues were addressed with the manager who had provided us some compensation, which we appreciate, but definitely does not justify another visit to this establishment.",

I dream about the walnut/cranberry bread. So was the homemade jam - WOW.  Beef stroganoff is good - a little al dente but the meat is so tender and the sauce is top notch. Same for the filet mignon. Excellently prepared. Just wonderful. Mr Muscle had the braised beef short rib served on vegetables and mashed potatoes. Claims it was one of the best meals he has ever had. We also tried the special one night, a mac and cheese (with poblanos chilis, corn, fresh tomatoes.. yum!). Its ALL SO GOOD.  Pass on the pancakes, not so wonderful, trust me on this one. Austin, Chelsea, Anna, TJ - everyone working at the bar and the restaurant are a jewel in the crown here. Eat in this hotel's restaurant - you will not regret it.",

    "text": "A friend of mine was having a birthday party at the Valley Ho last weekend and we decided to come here for breakfast before a day of debauchery at the pool. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict (can't remember if that's what it was actually called, but there's only two on the menu and it wasn't the traditional one). HOLY MOLY that ish was delish. Legit might be one of the best benny's I've ever had. I asked the server if they had wheat English Muffins and she said no, just homemade. \"Just Homemade\" - best English muffins hands down. I don't even wanna think how it contributed to my own muffin...muffin top that is.   Anyhoo, we came back here again the next day for breakfast. I didn't wanna be the freak that orders the same thing twice so I ordered the special...breakfast veggie quesadilla. It was good. For sure good. But it wasn't the benny. However, this time around I decided to go with Bloody Mary Bar. GREAT choice. Fantastic choice. It was only $5 and they have a great selection of items to build your own bloody and I'm not gonna lie, I made a damn fine drink.   I love me some good breakfast joints and this might be up there as one of my new favs. I think I'll just be the freak that always orders the same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And that Benny ain't broke.",

    "text": "This place has gone down a wrung from the last time I was here about a year ago. The food is still traditional and well-prepared and fresh and tasty. I do believe there is a chef back there somewhere who cares. The front house leaves more to be desired. Staff are courteous but there's a lack of consistency in professionalism. The booth seats were dirty, covered in crumbs and you could see piles of crumbs stuffed between the cracks.  I swept them away with my hands rather than put up a fuss. Our waiter was friendly though when he cleared our plates he left one small dish and a fry on the table. In fact he left the billfold next to the fry. Why didn't he bother really clearing the table?   The young woman who brought our food looked perplexed at what to do when she still saw us with salads. She took my dining partner's plate away (didn't ask) then I shoved mine aside. She took my fork. Didn't replace it. I had to scoot out the crumb-ridden booth and take one off another table.  Bread for the table was re-gifted. Seemed reheated, crispy and old.  This is elementary restaurant work folks. And we're dining, bordering on fine dining. Make sure people have silverware and time the meal delivery. Also in a fine environment don't ask if people are through so much. Plates are taken away when everyone at the table is finished. Otherwise one is getting dessert while the other is still working on a steak and then people aren't eating together anymore. It's simple dining training.  I actually found the service far below the level of the food. I would choose to eat elsewhere in the plethora of nearby dining choices than repeat the experience here, though they do a great steak and with a brush up on consistency and front of house professionalism I'd want to come back and pair it with my stay at VH.",

I always feel transported into a 1960s Hollywood movie-- it's just so expertly decorates and kept up.  The menu at Zuzu is so inventive. I LOVE the monthly showstopper shake (it's truly a work of art, not just a dessert).   Their breakfast has wonderful staples like the omelette or frittatas but I absolutely love the cinnamon roll donut bombs-- the inside MELTS!  For lunch or dinner, the BLT salad is a must and LOVE the braised short rib!   The patio is delightful even in the winter with the outdoor heaters.  We will be back again and again-- everyone in my family from me to my granny LOVES this place!",

The excellent service starts when you pull up to the valet stand: the valets are friendly and ZuZu's hostess makes sure you get your parking ticket validated. In the restaurant, service is prompt and attentive. Our water glasses and coffee cups never sat empty.  My Eggs Benedict entree was prepared perfectly, and my family was content with their choices as well. My son loved the seasoning on his roasted potatoes in particular. We ordered one plate of Cinnamon Roll Donut Bombs for the table, and my lord - they were amazing!

When they first brought it out, I swear my bottom jaw dropped and hit the table. I was in awe of its look and in my mind, I was hoping the taste would be equally great. I was not disappointed. The taste was fantastic. I'm sure this shake was loaded with sugar and fat but it's totally worth it. I heard that they offer different flavor every month, so now I have made it a mission to visit here once a month to try their shakes. I'm already excited for my next visit. Can't wait.  I did not eat anything here except the shake, but just because of the pure joy this shake brought me, this place deserves 5 stars.",

We shared some apps and light fare, including hummus and the little gem salad. That and a few rounds of drinks.   It's not cheap but it is unique. Sometimes there's a premium for nostalgia.

We landed on sharing avocado toast, I ordered the AZ omelet and Kyle ordered the eggs Benedict and the milkshake. They run a special over the top milkshake each month, and it is worth the $16 price tag. It's definitely meant to be shared though!  The eggs Benedict was just ok; my omelet was bland on the first couple of bites, but with the bacon and added hot sauce it was delicious!! The grits are next level, as are the breakfast potatoes- some of the best I've ever had. They also bring out complimentary chocolate chip and cranberry warm scones when you first sit down- they could be breakfast In themselves! So good!!

Over the top and full of sugar, fitting for the name of a \"showstopper\". Just a warning: they do take a while to make and they are definitely sharing size so be prepared. We now want to come back every month to try the new flavor!  Not to be overshadowed, we had the French fry appetizer as well. It was the perfect balance for the sugary shake. The fries were crispy and seasoned well, the dipping sauces were a good pairing. I would go back just for the yummy fries!",

The service was very awkward.. did not catch the name of our server but he made the whole process of ordering very difficult. The July stow shopper milkshake was the unicorn. Meh, berry flavored shake was ok but there was barely any of it. Way too much candy. These milkshakes seem to be more for the trill factor than actually tasting good. We shared a few appetizers - fries, yellowtail and the mac and cheese. All of which were just ok, the yellowtail was the best item we had but very overpriced for what you get. I wouldn't return and I guess some people just like paying $18 to take a picture of a milkshake :)",

We arrive and were oddly greeted I gave my name and said we had reservations and waited about 5 min while they got our table ready no big deal. We sat outside the weather was beautiful the decor is cute very Old school Beverly Hills / palms springs feel. Our server came out about 10-15 min later to take our drink orders and then came again and took our menu order. I started with the pork belly appetizer my mouth was watering from the description and everything from the first bite pretty much was a Huge disappointment from there out. The pork belly had no flavor was tough and chewy so I was only able to eat maybe one or two bites and pushed the rest of the dish to the side. Then on to the Filet & Pomme frietz. I was expecting at least a 4 oz filet & traditional thick cut fries ? That's not what came again major disappointment I wish I had taken a picture of the 6 small bites of beef that came out what a joke this is not a five star tasting restaurant and those where not Pomme frietz more like shoe string onions that come as a topping on a sandwich of some sort. I will say the only thing good about the filet was the chimachurri sauce was very good. On to desert I ordered the chocolate Banana cake that was the highlight of the night but had no pretzel crust as described ? Now I'm all fairness my friend ordered the same dessert and hers had the crust but only on one corner of her slice ? She had the octopus for her starter and I had a bite it was fine, she ordered the Huli Huli chicken thighs which she was not happy about at all. We both had thought that the menu completely lacked what it was describing and the value we received for Rw was very disappointing that we wasted our last night here on something so underwhelming.maybe unlike other places that participate during RW they choose to skimp here on quality and portions ? Not a very smart business move since this is the time to get your name out there and discover new places?",

They had scones to start you off, freshly made on Sunday, today. They had the perfect combination of chocolate and cranberries with soft and warmth that melted in your mouth. My main course was the duck confit. It's was literally to die for! The duck had the perfect crisp to it. Sided with some crispy home style potatoes. Although the potatoes were a bit salty, the sweet taste of the shallots made a stupendous pair! To top this plate off I ordered my eggs over easy which were cooked to perfection. I live almost an hour away and for the this plate I would drive here every Sunday!",

    "text": "Zuzu, located inside the Valley Ho hotel, has a strong and inviting retro vibe. Known for their instagramable and over the top milkshakes, the brunch food is also hearty and not disappointing. They also had a bloody mary bar when we were there! We tried the \"planks and eggs\" ($15-- crispy potato planks, red chile short rib stew, fried eggs, cotija, lime crema + scallion), which was hearty and full of tender chunk of meat, with an ever-so-slight kick to it. I really enjoyed this, although it came with large tortillas and I wasn't exactly sure what to do with them. Was I supposed to put the stew into the tortillas and roll it up? I wasn't sure, but either way, the meal was filling and satisfying. We also got the \"cereal milk stuffed french toast\" ($13 --fruity pebble milk crumb, cereal milk pastry cream, maple syrup + whipped cream), which was indulgent for sure. It was really creamy and the fresh fruit on it helped to balance the sweetness a little... but beware that this is more like a dessert than a breakfast item! Not for the faint of heart, if you're not a sweets person!   Service was friendly and attentive, and the ambiance was laid back. The only complaint I'd have was the pricing... a bit expensive. But overall, this is a great spot for brunch. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free dessert!!!",

    "text": "It's the most wonderful time of the year! Not only is the weather FINALLY cooling down but it's also the return of Restaurant Week. One of my friend's had chosen Zuzu for a group of us to dine at together. First, notably was the ambiance of this restaurant; we had gone in at around 7:00pm on Saturday night. It was super casual and although we had a reservation, it wasn't too busy yet at the restaurant. At around 8:00pm, they started live music which was being played far enough away from the restaurant so it wasn't too loud but definitely added to the overall relaxing vibe.  Onto the food itself, we all decided to go with the Restaurant Week special. Two of us got the Butternut Squash Raviolo, one got the Blue Hill Bay Mussels, and another got the Kale + Brussels Sprouts Caesar. All of us seemed to enjoy our appetizers! I personally really liked the Butternut Squash Raviolo; it was a good size, had a tasty filling with a light sage butter sauce, and a little bit of crunch from the pumpkin seed + pecan brittle.  For our entrees, I got the Mushroom, Fennel + Goat Cheese Tart per recommendation of our server. It was a tasty option especially since it was vegetarian. The tart was tasty with the creamy goat cheese, mushrooms, and lemon + chive butter with frisee on top. Since this was part of a 3-course meal, it was fine but the entree alone wasn't very filling. Others got the Manhattan Filet Steak and Hokkaido Scallops, which looked good and they seemed to like it.  Lastly, for dessert, three of us got Peanut Butter Cheesecake and one got the Praline Panna Cotta. The Peanut Butter Cheesecake was really really good! The cheesecake itself was creamy and definitely tasted peanut butter-y! The topping of lime gelee was interesting as it added a bit of lightness, plus there was also some crunch from the toasted peanut crumble!  The service the entire evening was also good. It did take a little bit of time for each course to come out, so I'd give myself ample time for dinner. Overall, a good experience, I'm likely to return.",

Someone else brought our drinks out and we then sat again for an extended period waiting to place our order. Finally a different server came and stated that they were taking over our table, odd but we were happy to finally order food.   The menu had so many options that I wanted to try. I decided on the breakfast burrito which was topped with green chili pork and a side of roasted potatoes. The flavors were amazing and everything went perfect together. I was surprised at how large the portions of all our meals were. It is nice because you are definitely getting your money's worth, but might be to much food for some people.",

I had the Poke Bowl and a side of french fries because they looked so good. My wife had the turkey and avocado BLT. The Poke Bowl was one of the better ones that I've had. The iced tea which was flavored but not sweetened was perfect. The people next to us had an incredible dessert and we ended up having some creme brulee and German chocolate cake which was really good along with a wonderful cup of coffee. The ambiance the temperature in the service from Matt made this an incredible lunch experience that I would highly recommend!",

Never have I felt so comfortable in a hotel lounge area.  When I am relaxing with friends and enjoying my cocktail, I feel like I am in my best friend's (with great taste in mid-centruty decor) living room.  In that sense, it is the perfect accompaniment to or extension of our hotel room.  Truly a home away from home and still a special treat at the same time.  Truth be told, I may be slightly biased as my husband and I got married at HVH a few years ago, however, we have been back to enjoy ZuZu and to stay at the hotel several times and never have I been disappointed.  ZuZu is the perfect venue for hanging out, whether it is after the most perfect wedding reception on the rooftop or an early morning family brunch.  We typically sit in the bar/lounge area.  There or from the bar you can order from the full food menu.  Bloody Marys and breakfast, brunch, lunch, and late night snacks, we've had it all.  The dip on the HH menu is the best deal yet, and my favorite lunch (or light dinner) is the chopped salad with a side of mac'n cheese.  Hubby loves the ZuZu burger and gets it at least once every trip; a new tradition that started on our wedding night!  But that's another story . . .",

The patio looked nice,but it was too windy that evening to partake and the pool was still open and a little too rowdy noise wise for us. I had the Rocky Point shrimp & scallop appetizer which was a little like a gazpacho,good though. My DH had the caesar salad.  For the entree I had the beef short ribs with green chile grits, loved it. Not spicy at all,but flavorful. My DH had the Asian BBQ salmon.  For dessert one of us had the warm chocolate flourless cake and the other choice was key lime pie. Both were very good. A bread basket with nice soft rolls and butter were delivered to the table shortly after being seated. The salmon & short ribs on the regular menu were $29/$28. just themselves, so I  highly recommend in the fall you check out AZ Restaurant week at Zu Zu if participating or another restaurant. The meal was $33. per person and also included a glass of red or white wine or a beer. My DH had a jalapeno margarita($13.00) and I had the 2 glasses of red that were included. We used the valet parking option which was complimentary,but a tip is expected. I did not see self parking,but there probably was some somewhere.",

I saw the amazing reviews and raves about the Eggs Benedict, and knowing that was her favorite I had to bring her here!  I went to the restaurant 2 hours before our reservation with flowers for my sister, asking that they be placed at the reserved table as a surprise. I also asked that a cake (made by the restaurant) be presented directly after the entree, also as a surprise.  When we arrived, the flowers were not on the table... no big deal, I just thought they may have forgotten. I kindly asked the two hostesses (same as I had seen earlier) to please bring the flowers out. 10 minutes after we were seated, the flowers were still not brought out, so I went back inside and asked them again and they were brought out....  We ordered drinks from our server and after receiving them, didn't see him until we asked the hostesses for him to come take our order. Thinking he may be new, we put that aside and ordered our food.  The food came, and it was absolutely impeccable. They definitely have some amazing chefs and that should not be masked by the horrible staff they have.  I want to wrap this up by saying that the men who refilled our waters and cleared our plates were by far the best staff that zuzu has to offer. The manager ended up coming to our table and apologizing AFTER the waiter and hostesses forgot the cake after our meal.... surprise surprise at this point.  My mom and I spent so much time planning out the perfect brunch for my sister and it put a huge damper on the entire day.... just wishing they could be a little bit more detail oriented and not keep promises they can't keep. Didn't think we were asking much but obviously more than they could handle.",

This time I finally did it, unfortunately the place was packed with spring breakers and the food service was slower than molasses, but we didn't let that ruin our morning and neither did our server, who quickly remembered my parents, who visit the VH often on their overnight trips to PHX. Anyway. What's not to love about their Classic All-American menu with delectable items ranging from healthy to not so healthy. And how about that Bloody Mary bar? Although I didn't partake in the Bloody Mary activities it was certainly fun to watch all the spring breakers curing their hangovers. Bottom line, the bar looks bomb. Next time, Mary! They've got all meals covered here: breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks and happy hour.  There's nothing better than enjoying a meal in an awesome setting, and VH offers that too. It's a hip and modernized retro kind of place. It's comfortable and relaxing. You can sit indoors or out on the patio.   I opted for a healthy breakfast and regret not ordering the eggs benedict, but a two hour ride home followed breakfast and I didn't want to go home with a full stomach, so next Benny! My two sunny side up eggs with quite possibly some of the best breakfast potatoes ever, were perfect. Smoked salmon on the side was tasty too. My cappuccino was less than perfect, but I've had coffee at ZUZU before and have never been impressed, so no shocker there.  I love VH, so I love ZUZU too. Even though it took about forty minutes for our simple breakfast to come out....I forgive you....it was CRAZY packed. I can't wait for my next visit. Saving room for the bloody mary bar and eggs benedict.",

Price of a full bottle is $90. Half price $45.00. Such a deal! The portions for dinner were appetizer size.  For 3 delicious scallops, I paid $28.00. \"3\" Penne pasta with chicken was $20.00. Veggie burger was the best deal, $12.00. I don't plan to return.",

    "text": "10/26/10  Terrific happy hour!  I'm almost tempted to give this first visit a 5-star review, but something's holding me back... Perhaps it was bec. I found it so dark indoors; How many times do I have to yelp it-- I like to see what I'm eating!!  When I'm dining solo and I can't take great photo souvenirs of my experiences, well, I sometimes feel \"what's the point?\"    I like this space.  Thinking back now, I wished I'd gone to the NYE bash held here.  Maybe next year...  Took Mom along w/ me, and I could tell she liked the old-style swankiness, too.  I must go back again, especially w/ such delicious fare and drinks and at such terrific prices, to boot!  We both liked our drinks-- mine was The Bramble, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A#zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a> a short, yet sexy concoction made w/ Bombay gin, lemon juice, muddled and fresh blackberries!  Not overly sweet, and very potent.  I believe Mom had the Pomegranate Fizz, a tall, cool, and refreshing drink made of Smirnoff vodka, pomegranate juice, and sparkling wine.  Can you believe these were $3 each??  But wait!  Not only were the cocktails $3, but so were all of the apps we tried.  And oh, how delectable they were!  Mom's favorite app was the Spinach Artichoke Dip, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg#XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a> which I found was too runny for my taste, but if she's happy, then I'm happy.  I was torn between the crunchy Artisan Grilled Cheese (brie, apple, fig jam) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg#jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a> and the salty-creamy Prime Rib Dip (horseradish mayo, au jus).  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ#k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe...</a>   The crunch factor I yearned for and did not get from the prime rib app, I found gratified w/ the grilled cheese.  Mmm... I think I've just decided where to go for happy hour after my massage appt. tomorrow!  LOL",

    "text": "While I never know what to expect from a hotel restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by how good of experiences I had at ZuZu. At the hotel for four days, I had breakfast here twice, and also enjoyed lunch on two separate occasions (though at the pool rather than in the restaurant itself). All meals were pretty dang tasty, and the price was right.   Let me tell you this: I am pretty obsessed with eggs benedict. When I saw the California Benedict ($13.00) on the ZuZu breakfast menu, I knew its destiny was to be in my belly. In liue of the traditional canadian bacon, it is served with avocado, tomato and spinach. While I guess you could argue that this makes it healthier (and thus more 'California' than a typical benny), when I scraped every last drop of decadent hollandaise off of my plate I certainly didn't feel like it was health food. Instead, I was indulging in one of the bests benedicts I've enjoyed in recent memory. It was so good, I had it for both breakfasts  For my poolside lunches I tried two different meals: The Famous ZuZu Burger ($12.50) and their turkey club. the ZuZu burger was stellar, with crispy bacon, balsamic onions and Maytag bleu cheese. It was cooked pretty much to my liking (maybe a TOUCH over the requested medium rare) and made me a very happy camper. Served with pesto mayo, the turkey club ($12.00) was good but not really all that memorable. I opted to upgrade to fries on the side, which cost me $2. I thought that was pretty weak, as fries are such a basic side, and they weren't fantastic fries by any means.   Service seemed fine at the restaurant, though sometimes a bit inattentive. I mean, nothing to get worried about and it's probably good for me to be reminded to slow down on occasion, but still sometimes I just want the check, you know?   As with everything at hotel Valley Ho, I'm ultimately quite impressed with ZuZu and look forward to being able to return.",

Our server was nice and tried to get us everything as quickly as possible. It was busy so she had to bust her butt working the floor, kudos to her. The retro decor is a lot of fun and makes for a difference experience.   So we almost ordered everything off the happy hour menu, you really can't go wrong with what you order, it was all great. Actually the only thing we did NOT get was the Asian Glazed Chicken Wings. Everything else was easy to share and nothing was left on any of our plates!  As for drinks, I went with my favorite drink which I was happy to see on their menu, the Bramble. It was strong but not so strong that it was hard to drink. My dad had the Haboob which was equally as strong.   Great drinks, great food, great service.",

However, they no longer offered truffle fries on the menu.  I called the manager before heading to the bar, and he said they would accommodate our craving and make them.  We arrived at the bar, which needed much updating to improve the ambiance.  It felt like a 5 and Diner.  I thought this was the Valley Ho? We were intending on dining for a full course lunch as well, but after the out dated exterior and interior, we no longer felt comfortable at Zuzu.  We had one round of drinks and the special-requested truffle fries, and were reassured of our initial impression of the restaurant, to leave.    The service was attentive, the cocktail/ wine list was adequate, and I have to give credit to the chef for making the truffle fries that are no longer featured on the menu. I wish the specially-made fries were impressionable, like the other reviewers felt from a few years back, but they were not.  I will not be back!  Best of luck to Valley Ho and Zuzu.  I believe updates and renovations are in dire need.",

Not a bad thing, they were certainly delicious...just not somewhere to go on a diet.   The food is pretty pricey as most hotels food is. I'm not sure if they have a happy hour but I'd like to check it out if they do. It's a fun night out to be there, walk around and see the decor. Because it was built in the 60's or 70's not sure...everything is kind of smaller and closer together than modern hotels which gives the whole place a nice feel.",

    "text": "This is such a cute restaurant. It has a 50s theme to it. I actually thought it looked a lot like the Jettisons TV show for those of you who are old enough to have watched it. It is located inside the Valley Ho Hotel. I have to admit, its a bit of a challenge to find it. We found a parking spot on the street, otherwise there is valet parking available. There is a parking lot but it states \"Permit Parking Only\" so I'm assuming it is for the guests of the hotel. I am not sure if the restaurant validates parking if you park by the valet.   The food was delicious! We were there for a Sunday brunch, around 11:30 a.m. I got the Arizona omelette, which was onions, peppers, slab bacon, jalapeno jack cheddar + avocado salsa. It came with potatoes and choice of toast, which I got wheat.  Very tasty. Hubby got the breakfast burrito, which was eggs, chorizo, green chile pork, pepper jack cheese, sour cream + pico de gallo served with roasted yukon potatoes; also looked and tasted scrumptious! We both had mimosas from the bar, but you could have a choice of a Bloody Mary bar or Mimosa bar where you made your own Bloody Mary or Mimosa. Your server would bring out the alcohol portion of the drink and then you could go to the bar and make what you wanted for either of the drinks you got.  We got scones that came with our meal. Oh my gosh! I had to resist eating more than just a nibble from hubby's chocolate one that he had but it melted in my mouth. We got three of them; hubby ate two.   Patty was our server and did an excellent job serving us! We'll be back for sure!",

They can easily upcharge like crazy since the hotel is so popular and hotel guests sometimes have no choice, but they really bring their A-game with reasonable pricing.   During Happy Hour, the prices are fantastic (don't ask me what they were, I sat here trying to recall for like 5 minutes and I just can't remember). It gets crowded but never chaotic. The service has always been exceptional.   There were a couple of mishaps during one of our visits and our server was extremely understanding and gracious. She went over the top to make up for some overly sweet drinks and just took really good care of us.   Drink selections are plentiful. Some cocktails were just not my favorite because they were too sweet. But you can easily ask in advance or make a request for less syrup. Wouldn't recommend the jamaica mojito but definitely would recommend the grapefruit basil mule.   We also gave the Showstopper Shake a try and boy did it stop the show. The seasonal flavor was Orange Dreamsicle and it was actually quite good for something that could give you diabetes.   As Jared S said, best Old-Fashioneds and he's right. I'm not a big whiskey person but Old-Fashioneds here are the real deal. Very business trip friendly as the tables have charging outlets, so convenient! Make sure to check-in for a free dessert!",

It was restaurant week when we came, so we ordered off a pre-fixed menu.  The pork belly appetizer with fried rice was by far the crispiest and juiciest pork belly ive had! It was delicious. The main entree was chicken with sticky rice. Well, knowing Thai food, I know sticky rice... I was really disappointed that it wasn't True sticky rice. The chicken was also bland. The banana chocolate cake was the dessert and it was really disappointing as well.  Way too thick and overly sweet. Not moist at all.   Overall, the pork belly was the star of the show...the rest of the dishes were very disappointing. Maybe I should have opted for the real menu instead of the restaurant week menu.",

    "text": "Zuzu is a really cool swanky bar inside of Hotel Valley Ho. I don't often say this about hotel bars but you could literally spend your entire night here with a bunch of friends if you wanted to. The food is great and the drinks are strong. I ordered the calamari one evening and a massive over-easy egg platter with a side of bacon in the morning). They have a pretty good happy hour too and a decent selection on the happy hour list. If you need to get some work done or charge up your phone, they even have outlets right inside some of the tables near the entrance!   Big shoutouts to my bartender Greg and my waitress Nicole:  Greg: Probably the best bartender I've ever met, seriously. Watching him work is a honor and a lesson in mixology. He operates with such speed and precision and I was in awe of watching how easily he made me the best Old-Fashion I've ever had. I've been searching for about 6 months so I'll have to come back, even if just for Gregs drinks.   Nicole: She is absolutely the sweetest and nicest server I've met in a while! She constantly checked up on us and laughed at all of my jokes (They were funny I promise!). She's the kind of person where you say to yourself, wow, if I lived here we could definitely be friends!   Thanks Zuzu!",

We ended up splitting the Turkey BLT and were impressed by the size of the dish (picture shows just my half). The sandwich itself was SUPER delicious with hefty portions of fresh turkey and thick bacon. The onion rings were some of the best I've ever had especially with their yummy fry sauce. Even the little touches like bringing sauces ahead of time before you even need to ask was so nice. We will definitely be back for dinner soon",

Straight off the bat after waking into the hotel, we felt like we were on vacation! Everyone was dressed for the island life with flowers in the hair and Hawaiian shirts and the music just brought me to Hawaii. We were seated immediately for our reservation at 9:30 outside on their patio and they were so accommodating and helped us move some umbrellas so our table would be in the shade. Their brunch menu is insane and I had so much trouble deciding what I wanted to taste! After ordering, they brought out these complimentary scones that were so good!  I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito and I was not disappointed at all! The breakfast burrito was massive and filled with eggs, chorizo, and pepper jack cheese. It was topped with green Chile pork, a sour cream drizzle, and pico de Gallo. The side of roasted potatoes was deliciously spiced and crunchy! I was so pleased with my choice! All of my friends enjoyed their meals as well. I will definitely have to come back to try their epic milkshakes!",

We just split the poke bowl because we wanted room for dessert! The poke bowl came out split for us and they were fresh & delicious! Then our Milkshake arrived- White Chocolate Gingerbread for December's Flavor! It was so rich and fluffy it was more like mousse! All the additional goodies were yummy as well!!

If you are looking for low price points the this restaurant in the resort is not the way to go but it is worth the extra cash if you want some great food at a great experience.   We had everything from a Chia coconut pudding bowl, a delicious impossible jalapeno burger, a fruity and delicious Acai bowl, and an order of avocado toast that was on huge Texas toast with some sprouts and sliced almonds on it.   Every person we were eating were in love with the service and food and vacation feel.   I definitely recommend it for a great getaway.",

Examples:  Warm towels were available to wipe our hands after eating the Baby Back Rib Stack but only after we asked for them (and it took a few minutes to get them).  Dirty utensils were cleared after appetizers but not replaced until our entrees were served and we asked for new utensils.         As for the food.....  We started with the Burrata (tasty but the large grapefruit pieces seemed like a strange addition to the dish) and the Baby Back Rib Stack (flavorful).   We then had the Seared Diver Scallops (very large scallops - my husband enjoyed them), Jidori Half Chicken (moist) and Crispy Brussels Sprouts (not at all crispy).    The Pie of the Day was described as warm pecan pie.   We ordered that but it definitely was not served warm and the filling was very dense, not at all gooey as I would have expected.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying our brunch guests were 45 min late which likely added to my only gripe with Zuzu.  Our waitress Noel was charismatic, very attentive and like it or not took great care in reminding me of the number of drinks I was having.  We started off with cocktails the wife ordering what we thought was a Bloody Caesar but turned out to be nothing more than Clamato and vodka.  Next a shrimp cocktail which was cooked perfectly.   Brunch entrees; Green Chili Pork Arepas with fantastic flavor. Plank and Eggs -big chunks of crispy potatoes on top of red chili stew (great flavor but somewhat overloaded after they add in sweet potatoes.  Deserts (Showstopper milkshake and German Choco cake) were outstanding.  Now to my only gripe; price point.  I know some of you may say we should have known the being at a Scottsdale hotel but $324.42 for brunch for 4?  Our guests being late meant we already had $42 worth of drinks before they arrived!  After eating, we tried to stroll through the pool party and were rejected at the door (something about guests only rule).  After that bill....C'mon.  All said, it was good food and great service so I don't want to dissuade anyone but be prepared to cough it up.",

Walking into the hotel we were both impressed with the atmosphere and vibe of the entire bar/lounge/restaurant area, vey pleasant! We both agreed it would be a fun spot to hang out.   The restaurant itself had some very cozy and romantic booth seats in the back and that's where we decided to sit. You definitely get some privacy and feel like it's just you two! Awesome for date night/celebrations with a significant other. The menu itself isn't huge and definitely on the expensive side but that's what we were expecting. We shared the poke to start and it was really yummy! The poke was very fresh, and came served with some delicious chips (I think they were made of root vegetables) and really good guacamole. I ordered the scallops while my hubby got the chicken. We loved both dishes! The scallops were cooked perfectly and the dish came with a really decent size portion of them. The chicken too was cooked well with crispy skin and flavorful juicy meat. We had to end our meal with the seasonal show stopped shake! I LOVED this shake. I'm a huge chocolate fan, the cake outside the shake was so decadent, the shake itself was a yummy chocolate caramel flavor and topped with house made Samoa cookies! We couldn't finish it all but for sure made a big dent! Highly recommend this spot for a fancy night out. Service was excellent, so was the food.",

The pork belly and filet, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. The chocolate cake was fine but the panna cotta was not the best. We barely ate it. Let's just say, there was a lot of misses that night.  Overall, I'm disappointed with my experience for their restaurant week menu. I expected better. Hopefully, it was just a one off.",

My BBF lives right down the street and I have passed by the darn place for years. Was so mad I missed the reinvention of \"Vics\" when it was open here for a bit. I cried when I heard it closed. Well it was nice to finally visit and eat here beyond the Grilled Cheese and Mac and Cheese throw down of course. (They beat my friend's husband but I won't hold that against them. My friend thinks I should though--JK --;o)-- not really, but sort of. lol)  Well this place has a lot of cheese and fish on the menu so I had a hard time deciding what to eat since I am not a fan of either. I so wanted to try their specialty burger but I despise Blue Cheese. A big sigh, since it sounded so great, all other ingredients considered.  I finally decided on the Kale salad with chicken and a side of fries. It was pretty good.  The bread they serve is yummy too. I loved their fries. The sauce they serve with it is Delish!  We went here last night with my NY club and to celebrate a wedding that took place over the summer. I can not speak more highly of the delightful waitress. Sorry I did not get her name but she is an ASU student who has a father that is a professor. Gooooo Sun Devils!  I want to thank her for her kindness. ( she knows why)   All the staff that I ran into were superb and friendly. The bar staffers were efficient and helpful, ( Mytry-lol) even the front desk folks gave us a big wave as we exited the place. The Valet said not one word about my messy car so that deserves a shout out in itself. In all that rain I felt a tad bad for them last night.   I love the retro feel of the lobby and patio area. I can just imagine Frank and Marilyn walking outside.  The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side for those watching pennies but pretty equivalent to the other places to eat in Scottsdale. In conclusion, I would like to go back again and perhaps book a Staycation.",

One evening we enjoyed the happy hour cocktails while enjoying the lively ambience of the patio. Our sweet server even brought us out an extra cocktail when a spare one had been made at the bar.   On the second night, some colleagues and I shared a bottle of wine in the lobby after an evening out on the town. It was such a fun and low-key place on a Tuesday night at 9 or 10 pm. I'm there are many times when this place is absolutely riotous, but it was the perfect speed for me to catch up with colleagues from all over the continent.

Today was my first time here and as I love the feel and the decor the staff and service was pitiful. We called 2 days ago for a Sunday brunch reservation. We got here a little early and we're sat right away. It being Sunday things were crazy, people everywhere, and tables are placed so close to one another to fit as many as possible. And for me that's fine, not a problem. We were sat outside right next to a indoor window, thankfully there were umbrellas on the patio to shade everyone, except us. As time went by the sun started to hit us. We asked for an umbrella and about 20 minutes later nothing. A member of our group had to get up to look for the manager who came and tried to move an umbrella for us, taking shade away from other people. Eventually we asked to move to another table which we got a reply of those are for people who reserved with us. Uhhh that's us! We move hearing snide comments from the people around us. Okay cool we finally have shade. High of 96 today btw. When we first were seated (in our first seats) about 6 of us order the Bloody Mary/mimosa bar. Sooo we get to our new table and our food comes out about 10 minutes before we even get our drinks, which we have to get up and leave our food to prepare. One things for sure the food is fresh and prepared well. Loved my veggie omelet with goat cheese and oven roasted tomatoes, would recommend it to any one it fancies. Our server seemed to care very little about how we were treated and that we were happy, Something I would think an establishment in Scottsdale would be noted on. As a results our drinks were comped and we ended our meal on a high note. (Left out a couple more instances but the were small, compared) come at your own risk and enjoy the food and atmosphere.",

Both were quite delicious - with the key lime pie being very light with a good lime taste.   Service was phenomenal - very attentive server - and the place is so great looking - love the retro look!

After reading local headlines about the multi-million dollar investment the new owners of the Valley Ho put into the place, I had to check it out.  I'm so glad I did. The hotel is gorgeous, inside and out. It's like going back in time to some very chic '50s Hollywood mansion. I felt underdressed. I should be more stylish to eat here or something.  Anyway, the food is amazing. I've been back twice since the first visit. Parking is valet and the restaurant validates your ticket to make it free. I had this burger with apple and some sort of aioli that was absolutely out of this world. Second time I visited I got this breakfast that had fried eggs and slow-roasted beef with this amazing savory sauce. It was a total gutbomb and not really the smartest thing to eat at 9am, but I enjoyed it heartily.  Duly impressed, the fiancee and I decided to host our bridal shower here, and have them cater it too. The room was stunning, and the staff was great. They had a staff member operate our buffet while our guests grabbed what they wanted amongst an assortment of soup, salads, and sandwiches. Everything was delicious and fresh, and much more impressive than similarly catered events I've paid twice much a head for (I think it was better food than our wedding, actually).  Staff is fantastic and knowledgeable, service is great, and the food is so awesome they could charge 50% more for it and I wouldn't really complain. This place is super trendy and a great way to impress a date or business client. Plus, it doesn't have the obnoxious overly fancy ambiance, lackluster generic food, and snotty staff that a lot of pricier (and totally not worth it) places in Scottsdale do.",

Drinks arrived correct and timely, (we were one of four total tables on a Saturday at 7:30 pm), food did not take long, and bill arrived in a timely fashion.  We ask to see a Sunday brunch menu which never arrived, and the server had a slightly arrogant attitude which did not help. He gave suggestions when ask but very short with no description. Example, \" What app is better mussels or tortellini?\" Answer. \"Mussels\". No reason, no flavor, no added input, just mussels.  Food. The recommended mussels were the worst thing of the night. I had a terrible after taste on the two I ate, and thought maybe it was a bad combo with the drink I was having. Then my wife stated the same thing, and we compared the after taste we were having to a scent. I will spare you the scent but it was not something you would ever expect to feel like you tasted, nor want to. We did not complain however the manager noted we ate very few of them, and ask why. To my wives embarrassment I explained the flavor in with the scent we tasted, and had a laugh with him about it. I was not trying to be rude, just being honest about the flavors. (I was a server all through collage) He stated he would remove them from the bill, and took them away. I mentioned to him that we weren't upset, and understand this happens. (remember we did not complain, he ask). The mussels were still on the bill when we paid. My wife and I both had the dinner specials, which were pretty good. I had scallops, which all but one side of them were seared properly The sauce was great, and all in all good a dinner.    I had the Bramble from the bar, which was the highlight of the night for me. It is $10 regularly, however $4 on happy hour. Great drink Wine list was good enough, and very reasonable.",

Holy cow, this stuff is amazing!! I'm not a mushroom fan, so I had them sub in heirloom tomatoes, and what a great decision that was! The sauce that they're served in is so sweet and creamy and the parmesan cheese shavings on top are the perfect accent. You've got to try this dish before they take it off the menu (think it's seasonal).  I also recently discovered their fantastic happy hour! It goes until 7, so there's plenty of time to take advantage of the specials. They have a whole menu of specialty drinks that are only $3, in addition to a great appetizer menu. We're planning on going this Friday to take advantage again!",

I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.  The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.

They caught me in a good mood.  We accidentally wandered in during brunch. We had already eaten breakfast, so we were in a tough spot. However, the waitron was kind enough to offer up some lunch menus. Good on her.   It was also nice of her to bring the flavored syrup for my soda separately. Now if only she'd brought the check in a timely manner when we were done.  I ended up ordering something off the brunch menu anyway -- a grilled chicken sandwich. Supposedly, it's topped with brie and arugula, dressed in a bacon dressing, and served on brioche.   Someone must've forgotten to place their Sysco order. Because, my sandwich was topped with cream cheese with some brie rind mixed in, and spinach. There were some cold pieces of bacon fat in there, that may indicate some sort of dressing.  The chicken itself was moist, but completely flavorless.The brioche had potential, but somehow it got soggy and gross.  Bleagh. I hate to say it, but I could have gotten a better chicken sandwich at Applebee's for $7.95.",

    "text": "I must've ordered the wrong thing. Dangit. And I was so excited to try this place, too. I wanted to be bad and order the grilled cheese. But, I went with a salad. It's the Gruyere cheese that got me. I had to have it. Little did I realize that the lettuce they used would be your standard, boring iceburg. Ick. But, I did appreciate the combination of other flavors, and the thing was massive (took half with me for later).   But, since eating at ZuZu, I've decided that if you go out as a treat, don't order a salad. Order something that's going to atleast have a high start value, like the blue cheese fondue.   Anyway... Have you ever had a roll so good that you thought it was laced with some addictive illegal substance? Uh, yeah. Cafe ZuZu's rolls are UN-believable. Too bad my request for seconds went unheard. I would have even paid for 'em. Words can't capture how tasty these rolls were - warm, fresh from the oven, fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.   Service was anything but stellar. Our server tried, I'll give her that. But she seemed a bit scattered. Good thing Paul, the host (and/or manager, not sure) came by to see how everything was... and to confess that, yes, even he is addicted to the rolls.   Will I be back? Doubtful. I hate to valet park, and it's mandatory at Valley Ho. It's complimentary, of course, if you eat at ZuZu, but even then, you have to factor in a good tip on top of another good tip on top of the price for lunch... Seems like alot of effort, doesn't it? It'd be one thing if the food were worth it, but, like I said, I think I ordered the wrong thing. Even my lunch buddy, who had a green chile burger, said the food was just okay.   Cafe ZuZu, you get Cool Kid Points for trying, but I'm docking points off for poor execution.",

I murdered him with my water glass in front of the waitress and she didn't seem too concerned with disposing of the body. His corpse remained on the table for the rest of the lunch...  The atmosphere is pretty nice... I've been to the Ho quite a few times since the remodel and I kinda like it. The douche-factor is quite high here... in fact, you might step on the premises and think that this is the factory where they make douches. Anyway, it's fitting that the front lawn smells like shit this time of year. It smells like they fertilize it with dog and human turds. It looks beautiful at least. I have to smell the lawn because I would rather walk the driveway than have to valet park with those half-wits.   Back to the food - we first had a fondue and chip starter... potato chips with a cheese dip? It was both tasty and awful at the same time. I questioned the freshness of the cheese after a few dips, so I stopped dipping. The chips tasted like they came out of a bag, but they were also quite greasy. With their dip, they clearly should've gone with multi-color tortilla chips made from fresh. At these prices, they should be able to afford it.   For mains, I had a Caesar salad with grilled chicken and my lunch-mates both had fish tacos. I found the salad to be quite bland - the dressing was clearly from a tub and the chicken was rubbery and overcooked and dry. This place doesn't cook from fresh from what I can tell - all pre-packaged and frozen. The tacos weren't fishy in a bad way, but the verdict on them was that they were just okay.   The prices aren't outrageous, but they aren't cheap either and for what they charge - they should offer better food. I was disappointed. The drinks in the Ho bar are grossly overpriced. I guess if you have to eat here, you won't die.  This place is so average, it deserves a 2.5/5 instead of a 3. No need to avoid, but nothing to rave about.",

The outdoor area has bright orange umbrellas and sweet little potted flowers adorning each table.   I only had breakfast options, but each hit the spot. My first day, I had their home made granola w/cranberries and apricots, with yogurt on the side. The granola was really top notch, and the dried fruit was plentiful, no searching for it among the grains. The second morning, I opted for the strawberry waffles, which were nice and fluffy. I don't make big demands of my waffles -- they just have to be hot and right texture -- and these were juuust right.  In addition tot he strawberries, they also came with an orange curd, which I ordered on the side -- a really nice touch!  I'm not sure if the orange or pineapple juice that I had was fresh-squeezed.  I somehow don't think that it was, but was tasty nonetheless.  My servers both days were extremely attentive and sweet.    I really loved the fact that the hotel's free wi-fi worked here.  It make it a great spot to work while eating, and also to sit in on/host meetings. The only downfall in this department was the lack of outlets.  However, they probably don't want you whiling away your whole afternoon there, even if you *are* a hotel guest, so perhaps that's for the best!",

I really liked the look of the menu which contained everything from signature dishes to old favorites.  Our service was pretty great, also.  But everything smells awful.  OK, maybe not everything, but our plate of mushroom grits (better in idea than reality) and my ZuZu burger reeked to high heaven.  I'm being completely serious when I say that I would hesitate to ever visit again based on this factor alone.  Clearly, I'm never ordering either item again, but now it seems like one big crap shoot.  It doesn't help that the burger tasted awful, too.  Our waitress gladly took it back for a replacement which came promptly.  Replacing their terrible, caked-on bleu cheese with cheddar was the best decision of the night.  Still, my backup burger came complete with a scorched bun, an obvious consequence of the rush.  I guess it could be worse.  They could have charged me for that awful burger I ordered and the mushroom grits could have smelled more like vomit.  Still, my expectations were so high and I left totally bummed out.",

The food was good though.  I has the cheeseburger, it was really good.  We had the cheese plate for an appetizer and it was just so-so.  Others indulged in mash potatoes, macaroni and cheese and some salads.  They all seemed content with their food.  I really enjoy the bar in Hotel Valley Ho.  Very chill and cool.",

I had a chicken penne with a pesto cream sauce that was really rich but flavorful. The chicken was swimming in the cream sauce, but still managed to be remarkably dry. I did like the addition of the sun dried tomatoes- they were a sparse but tasty commodity on the plate.   The atmosphere is really nice, it's dim and romantic, particularly when seated in one of the round booths along the back wall. The service is prompt and friendly, unlike many of the trendy restaurants in town. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately, but it sounded amazing. We  did have coffee after dinner, but my espresso was a bit more bitter than it needed to be.   If you want to impress your date, this is a great place for that. Just make sure they aren't vegetarian because there isn't much on the menu for the veg-heads.",

We didn't have the best of experiences within the hotel itself but our two meals here were definitely good experiences. I would actually return to this cafe, even though I would probably not stay at the valley ho again. For my dinner I got the crispy Thai salad and my bf got the zuzu burger. Both were prepared well, with care and attentiveness. The ingredients were fresh and zesty and everything was plated nicely. Our server was a bit annoying at first and then he disappeared until it was time to deliver the food and pick up the check. He reeked of cigarettes, but aside from the server, our meal and experience was wonderful. We even ate a small bite for breakfast the next morning and again, everything was delicious and fresh. I love that I live less than a mile away from this place, so I'm sure I will return. But I will ask for a different server, that's for sure.",

    "text": "This would probably be a five-star review if I came for happy hour, but coming here for dinner was a solid experience nonetheless.   My uncle was staying at the Valley Ho so my mom, sister, and I met him for dinner here. The place was pretty empty on an early Saturday night, but I really liked the swanky, retro atmosphere.   The menu looked pretty good all the way around, but what really stood out to me was the number of salad options and the \"small plates\" that were offered. There was about ten different salad options, and although none of them seemed completely crazy, original they all sounded delicious. One of those with a small plate (there's about 12-15 different options there) makes for a great meal.   I went with a Cesar salad (I know, boring), but it was delicious. It was a little heavy on the dressing, but the croutons were to die for . I went with the lamb sausage small plate which came with a tangy cucumber salad, which was delicious as well. With the Cesar salad this was the perfect amount of food. My uncle (who can be a pain to dine with) had the salmon, which he really liked (he was very skeptical about eating salmon in AZ). My parents come here often and my dad (who wasn't with us this time around) says the beef stroganoff is the best he's ever had, and that's pretty big coming from him.   The service here is good (although like I said the place was pretty empty during my experience) and the prices are adequate for the portions and quality of the food. When I'm back in AZ visiting the fam, I'll be back! I NEED to come here for happy hour!!!",

Great happy hour deals, excellent desserts (I had their coconut cream pie EVERY NIGHT I stayed at the Hotel Valley Ho recently), and enough variety to satisfy every type of palate.

ZuZu is actually inexpensive compared to other \"fancy\" looking restaurants/bars.   In all honesty, I have never eaten here but I've nibbled off of peoples' plates and the food is great if you're looking for bar food with a little flare.

Flat Iron Steak and Duck Sausage (sweet pea tortellini + shiitake mushrooms) - perfect flavors, perfectly cooked. Would have liked to see one more slice of steak and more sausage... normally I'd have still been hungry  Chocolate Truffle Cake - this was the only item that was not great, it was so-so. flavors were average, and the cake part was a bit dry.",

    "text": "Instructions for a \"funtabulous\" happy hour in Scottsdale:   1. Go to Cafe Zuzu.  2. Have the delightful Lacey be your server.  3. Order any of the speciality cocktails on the $3 happy hour menu.  3A. In particular order the Bourbon Smash and Bramble!  4. Order a couple of noshes off the happy hour menu or even a \"supplementary\" item off the lounge menu.  4A. In particular order the barbecue mini pork shanks, the grilled artisan cheese mini sandwiches and the apple, endive, pomegranate salad.  5. Enjoy people watching in the crowded bar that magically empties out as 7:00p (the end of happy hour) approaches.   If you are visiting Scottsdale, as we are, and are not regulars at Cafe Zuzu, here are a couple of tips that might be helpful for you before you go to Zuzu.   First, web site ad aside that shows a young woman sitting with legs and dress askew, have no worries...you will not be offered a lap dance with your cocktails. (Although, my husband who wondered if this might be so based on the marketing photo on the web site may have been a tad disappointed. ;-) )   Second, you do not have to use the Valet parking at the Valley Ho to get into Zuzu. Self parking is available around the side of the building, a little hard to find but it's there.   Third, yes you really ARE going the right direction from the gate at the parking lot in the long walk through a sort of dark \"tunnel\" of buildings to get to the pool area of the Valley Ho where ZuZu is located...trek on intrepid traveler.   Last, if there is seating outside (not on the night we were there due to inclement weather) it looks as if that could be as much fun as was the inside seating! Even for those of us who are...ahem...more \"mature\" happy hour fans for whom the retro design at the Valley Ho and Zuzu reminds us of our childhood.  (And remember, all those younger people have to go to WORK the next day and we are blissfully retired. :-) )",

This last Monday we were at a dinner featuring Cline Cellars' wines.  The dinner started out with a lobster risotto paired with a pinot gris.  Lots of lobster over creamy risotto was the perfect start.  Next was a warm mushroom and leek salad.  The Cline Cashmere blend wine might have been our favorite of the wines.  The herb roasted lamb chop with goat cheese and pine nut ravioli was outstanding.  For dessert we were served a peach bread pudding paired with a late harvest mouvedre.  What an outstanding finish to a fabulous meal.  Get on their email list for upcoming dinners.  Chef Wiley is one of the most talented chefs in the Valley and these dinners really let him show his talent and creativity.  At $52.50 per person they are a steal!",

    "text": "I frequent the Hotel Valley Ho Spa on average 15 times per year. I like to make a day of it.  After 3 downhill lunches at this last stop, I decided to update my review. Zuzu continues to blame the opening of their new hotel Mountain Shadows on the low performing, unorganized food coming out of the ktchen. Waited 15 minutes for a flat glass of champagne. Last visit ordered brunch California eggs benedict. It literally looked like they tossed the kitchen sink on it. Awful presentation. The muffin, which they are supposed to make scratch was small and tasteless, the butter sauce was swimming the plate the avacado was not sliced, but hunked on and cooled the eggs and entire dish. The side potatoes were burned and greasy. The waitor brought me new and it was deep fried.  Just aweful. Tried the roasted beet side dish and just like the Eggs Benedict it was over salted and a bit strange as it was hot from oven and all goat cheese gooey.  For a day at the spa with the extra treat of dining out...yesterday was my last dining tab with Zuzu. Again, this review describes this last meal, but reflects the last four  to six months of downhill performance and product.  Also, Hotel Valley Ho itself is looking a bit tattered too. To me, everything is slipping because of new focus on their Mountain Shadows Resort. I think this is a mistake and a huge business oversite. This place used to be great. The staff though is always friendly and prifessional. This food is now acceptable as roadside diner fare you might grab touring.  My expectation is much higher... kind of like their cocktail prices, which still settles around 11 to 15 dollars.  Before I would never mention because the food used to rock. Pains me to write this, but I have been giving staff feedback for about 6 months now. My spa days are officially getting shorter  because of yesterday's meal.  I will not be dining at Zuzu any longer. Final note to management. The menu Items have not changed. The menu is stagnant and has been since I wrote my first wish for rotating fare but gave high accolades years ago. I am not in the hotel industry, but one busy resort shouldn't have to suffer due to expansion of building another.  I am sad that my spa days will be shorter. It might even prompt me to find a new spot for massage and nails now as I like to make a refuge out of my day and to do that..I need to dine.",

The amazing, talented Chef Sean created wonders on a plate... Seared Ahi - Delicious Truffled Grilled Cheese - Outstanding Asian Pear Salad - Perfection (That was course #1) Brussel Sprouts Au Gratin - Mmmmm Crab Cakes over Cheesy Grits - Speechless Lamb Sausage - Oh so good Mussels - Seriously the BEST I've ever had (anywhere)!!  (That was course #2) Tropical Iced Tea w/Fresh Mint & a side of Simple Syrup -  Refreshing (Could not fit another course in... will have to go back for dessert!)  Well, enough about the food, let's move on to the atmosphere. Very cool, very chic, very retro (50's). We could not stop thinking & talking of ideas on how to bring more people here, i.e., family, friends, large gatherings, work parties, etc. We want to share the feeling & the fabulous food we enjoyed here. Not to mention, they try to source local, have fresh herb garden right outside the kitchens back door, and mostly made from scratch! The service was personable & friendly! And we hear they have a great happy hour during the week, which we will definitely be back for!  The team that put life back into the Hotel Valley Ho & Cafe ZuZu is genius! The place is simply impressive. A gem tucked away that should be admired, enjoyed & taken to the next level!   GO NOW! =)",

I went for happy hour and truly enjoyed the options. I went with the ZuZu Senorita which was a signature cocktail while my friend got the sparkling wine, both $4. I liked my drink but the rim needed salt and perhaps a little less tequila (it was a very HAPPY hour). We each ordered a side. I got the prime rib dip and she orded the pretzels with chips and cheese. Each of us were in food heaven. The prime rib dip came with an au jau sauce and had the most melt in your mouth cheese on top. The meet was fall off the bone good and the bread was perfect. Two little slices were enough to satisfy a happy hour hunger.   I would def go back here for fancy drinks with a friend, hopefully grab a sit on the patio outside. Parking is complimentary valet and the car boys are very sweet.",

The atmosphere is clean and retro.  Great place to take out of town guests, and there's rarely a wait, which is great if you're cranky in the morning like me and need your coffee NOW.  Their menu is pretty expansive, there's something for everyone.  My husband gets the smoked salmon platter with accompaniments and I get the yogurt parfait w/ homemade granola and fresh berries.  Very high quality ingredients, and you can have a healthy meal without compromising taste and pleasure.    Very nice shaded patio with a view of garden-like flower beds and the pool.   I've been for Dinner on three occasions. It was fine - Let's rank it a three star dinner.  The parking is tough.  Either valet at the hotel (muh!), or park in the lot of the former Trader Vic's and enter through the pedestrian gate to the West, or park in what looks more like an   employee parking lot, directly off of 64th Street (?) and use the walkway east-ward.",

I've never been disappointed and I'm sure I'll continue to be a frequent customer, especially since I'm now living so close-by in Old Town!    I recall that they have some tasty martinis on the menu, but most recently I enjoyed a glass of Cakebread Sauv Blanc - you can never go wrong with that!  Chef Chuck Wiley does a fantastic job in the kitchen as I've both dined in and experienced his culinary creations around town at some foodie events.    Since my latest experience at Cafe Zuzu was for breakfast, I have to dedicate a paragraph to that... wow!  I'm hesitant to share this since I don't know that I want the word out about this, but Cafe Zuzu's breakfast rocks!  I was there with Andrea R (the morning after the pARTy), and our meal was divine!  I was leaning toward ordering their wheat pancakes served with fruit butter and a side of egg whites but Andrea was torn between their yogurt and granola and the same pancakes... So, our waitress suggested we order both and share.  Sold!  She ended up bringing us each half portions of pancakes, egg whites, granola and yogurt - and the half portions were plenty!  The granola was some of the best I've had and everything else was pretty damn delicious too.  I washed mine down with coffee and water and Andrea had some OJ with hers... We sat outside for a while after we finished, talking, working, and taking in the fresh air.  The manager, Paul, came out to check on us, and he even helped me carry my computer inside once we decided we were ready to go...   Cafe Zuzu is especially convenient when staying at the Valley Ho, but I now see it as a local dining destination as well.  I'm already looking forward to that granola for breakfast next time I visit!",

The food was average at best and the menu was very limited. Maybe my expectations were too high.  I ordered the eggs benedict and the grilled cheese.  The Benedict was nothing special and the grilled cheese was just horrible. Too much avocado and green chili made it cold and there was not nearly enough cheese. The bread was thick which made the lack of cheese even worse. My girlfriend had over easy eggs with bacon and potatoes.  Hard to mess that up and she said it was good.  I really expected something special and didn't get it. Service was good and multiple people checked in on us....So that was a plus.",

Take a trip back the late 60's and let's take Miami, San Diego, Cabo, and put it in a martini shaker and pour it right smack  in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and you get Hotel Valley Ho.  Definitely a party scene.  Service-  The waiter did not seem to have any real opinions about the food, just that it was all wonderful.  In summary I would return for drinks, and fun, not the food.",

When I visit family in Scottsdale I often find myself spending time at this hotel sitting at the pool and ordering drinks and lunch!  The pool is open to the public as long as you are buying food or drinks, and the retro feel just adds to the fun! ZuZu is no different!  From the time you walk in to the time you are leaving, it is just plain fun for me!  We dined at ZuZu on a Saturday night, so we were sure to make reservations.  I had not eaten at the restaurant previously, again only at the pool which is a completely different menu.  We had reservations at 6:30, but decided to go early to have happy hour cocktails in the lounge.  The staff and bartenders are welcoming and friendly.  The lounge was very crowded but we did manage to find a table to enjoy our drinks. Headed to the restaurant at 6:30 and our table was waiting for us.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and offered advice when asked.  Most of us ordered the short ribs. The short ribs were ancho chile braised with creamy green chile grits.  They arrived steaming hot and fork tender!  They had so much flavor that each bite was a delight!!  The grits were amazing as well. I had also discovered that by checking in on Yelp you received a free dessert.  I had absolutely no room for dessert, but our waitress was more than happy to box it up for me!  I ordered the Key Lime Pie and really enjoyed it later.  Perfectly tangy but not over tart. All in all I loved this dining experience.  It may be slightly higher priced than other restaurants, but that is to be expected in a hotel resort restaurant, and in my opinion was worth every penny!",

    "text": "Cafe ZuZu is now, quit possibly, the best burger spot in Phoenix.  Cafe ZuZu's has always been one of our go-to spots in Scottsdale. The innovative menu, decent prices, and mid-century modern decor has made it a favorite with our friends and extended family for years.  They have always had a solid burger selection, although we usually went for something else as there's no shortage of enticing items on the menu. (The truffled grilled cheese was memorable.)  But in the last few years, ZuZu has really upped their burger game. The cafe has entered, and won, an annual burger cook-off, with the winning entry ending up on the menu for a year. The latest winner, the Merlot Melt, is a masterpiece and I've ordered it every time I've eaten at ZuZu's since I saw it on the menu in March.  I was recently preparing my mouth for another Merlot Melt when -- Bam! -- the waitress hands us all a burger menu. A Burger Menu!!! Cafe ZuZu now has a second menu devoted entirely to burgers, and what burgers they are.  After much deliberation, I started with the Hangover, and it was AMAZING. A juicy hamburger patty, sharp cheddar cheese, jalapeno, onion rings, and a fried egg. I kid you not, it was stunning.  Now I have to go back to try the other five or six new burgers. I can't wait to experience the Bayou Burger, the PB + J Burger, and the Smoke Stack Burger.  For those who might object to paying $16 for a burger, I have three words: Worth. Every. Penny.  The price is made a little easier because the burger-menu burgers all include Cafe ZuZu's famous twice-fried fries (which are extra on the regular menu). I also recommend taking advantage of the Burger & Beer option, which gets you a draft craft beer for $4.  Update: We went again last Sunday, only to discover that the burger menu is M-F only. So you'll have to clear some time during the week. #burgercraving",

There is a bar area, a medium in door area and a rather large outdoor seating space. We came in for a birthday dinner and everyone was impressed with what they ate! I had the foie gras and the brussel sprouts! I was able to share both and still had plenty to eat. I tasted the lobster grits as well. I highly recommend getting! The service was great, the food was great and the ambiance was relaxing, yet chic. We had a night we'll never forget. At the end they were able to split the checks for us and gave the birthday girl a very cute dessert with a candle. I'll be back to try more food for sure!",

    "text": "ZuZu was awesome. A good friend took me here for my birthday. Our server was Sharon and she was great. She was attentive, polite and answered our questions professionally. She was on her game as I suspect most if not all of the servers here are. The staff seemed very polished, nice. There are a couple things that actually pushed this review over a 5 Star. And I don't throw 5 Stars around like a lot of Yelpers. First, the butter that is served with the bread was cool but not frozen, so it was easy to spread on the delish rolls that come before the meal. Second, I ordered an Iced Tea and it came with a small container of simple syrup. Yep, sugar water. Why oh why can't every place do this. Awesome. This is probably the single most impressive concept I've run into in awhile. Most, if not all sweeteners do not dissolve in cold liquid. Anyone who uses the pink, blue, yellow, white, brown or green packaged sweetener can attest to this. The only reason I use the one I do is because it's the one that dissolves the best in my iced tea. Ahhhh, but not here. The simple syrup was awesome and my tea tasted great. On to the food. I had the Hangover Burger. This burger comes with crispy jalapeno, cheddar cheese, onion strings, topped with chorizo and a fried over-easy egg. They schmear a smoked chile aioli on the soft bun. I ordered mine medium rare and it was pretty close to that. The only negative would be that the crispy jalapeno's were not crispy at all, barely even toasted really but that didn't effect the taste one bit. The bun was soft, the chorizo was properly cooked, the egg was spot on and the onion strings were not greasy and fried perfectly. Winner winner Hangover burger dinner.  My friend had The Famous ZUZU Burger. He ordered his rare and unfortunately it came out a bit more medium rare. It was close and I'm sure the cook was just nervous about sending out a rare burger. Regardless, he ate it and said it was a good burger. The famous ZUZU has smoked bacon, balsamic onions and blue cheese crumbles on it. We both got the house made potato chips which were awesome. Sharon brought us some catsup and ranch dressing for dipping.  All in all, a very nice experience. This will be my new place in central Scottsdale to grab lunch.  Great Service. Great Food. Great Experience. 5 Stars.",

    "text": "ZuZu is the utterly fabulous hotel bar/restaurant in my favorite hotel of all time, so how can I not grant them 5 stars?   Expect more of that Mid Century vibe you encounter in the glorious hotel lobby continuing through ZuZu's chill lounge and restaurant's interior. The dining room is large and sports some comfy round booths, which I love, and the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal alfresco. I've spent time in the lounge, too (of course I did), which is very swank 60s jetsetting into the future. I like. I very much like. Heck, the Hotel Valley Ho is the stuff of architectural and design genius in its entirety. I wouldn't expect anything less of ZuZu  Although on the whole, the staff ranges from decent (yet maybe not the most on the ball when it comes to remembering that you've asked for something) to totally on it, I have to give special props to Sharon, who's the best breakfast waitress, like, ever! You could swear that she's purposely conjuring up the no-nonsense but loving vibe you'd expect from Madge at the diner back in the day, but no, there's nothing contrived about her. She's an absolute asset to this restaurant and stands out as someone you'll be recommending that people request when they are planning to visit.  Onto the food: I hate eggs and rarely if ever eat them, but I'll be damned if I didn't order that garden veggie omelet three times (egg whites only) on my past two stays. It's super fluffy and stuffed with seasonal veggies and goat cheese. Perfection! Side of grits, yes, please!!!  A special note: What happened to that spectacular cheese plate?! No, seriously, I was looking forward to returning just for that and now it's apparently no longer on the menu. Sadness! Read Aimee K's review for the deets on this plate. We were both incredibly disappointed to learn of the menu update. I'm not even going to tell you about how amazing it was because I don't want you to get your hopes up. But for the love of god, please, pretty please, ZuZu put it back on the menu!  I don't know if they do the same Happy Hour in the fall (I didn't see mention of it?) as they did in the middle of the summer but I felt it was outstanding. Cheap glasses of wine and specially-priced apps (including, *sob* a smaller version of the aforementioned cheese plate).   Roooooom service!!!! As in 24-hours! Another perk of staying at the Ho. It's prompt, and friendly and well, you can't argue with a good guac. It's the side of sauteed spinach, however, that still has my mouth watering. And memories of that cheese plate enjoyed back in July.  Sigh. I really need to get over it.",

    "text": "I'm done with restaurant week. I don't understand restaurants' line of thinking. Instead of showcasing good food, they often choose to go the cheap route. My friend and I decided to try zuzu tonight because of their tasty looking menu. We got there early and had a drink in their bar. I had their blackberry mule, which was fine. My friend had a blackberry/gin drink that was terrible. She said she'd had better on mill (which is not a compliment). Regardless, it was happy hour and the atmosphere was fun so we weren't too worried about the dinner.   We were seated outside, which was cute with a fire pit. For dinner, my friend had the butternut squash soup, shrimp pasta, and goat cheesecake. I had the wagyu beef, the new York strip,  and chocolate dessert. The soup was fine but was oddly topped with marshmallows...those needed to be removed. The wagyu beef was tiny but easily the best item on the menu. My real problem was with the entrees. My 'new york strip' came out and looked like a cut of mystery meat in a cafeteria covered in gravy and sitting in a pool of blood (ugh). The first bite of meat was all fat and gristle (actually had to spit it out). I'm not sure on what planet this counts as a new York strip. The waiter asked if our meals were good and I told him not really... I asked him to clarify the cut of meat and he told me that they cook their new York steak like a prime rib in a big slab and shave off pieces for each plate.....ummm they probably should mention that on the menu. I don't like prime rib because (like this meat) it tends to be gelatinous and lacking flavor. Talk about bait and switch. He offered to replace the meal, but I didn't want any of the other restaurant week dishes either. My friend's pasta essentially tasted like buttered noodles with overcooked shrimp. Yuck. She said lean cuisine was better. The desserts were also a massive failure. Goat cheesecake tasted awful (and I love goat cheese)... Chocolate dessert was hardly chocolatey at all. I felt completely mislead. I would not come here again nor recommend it to anyone beyond happy hour.",

The atmosphere is very modern and hip, as to be expected from the Valley Ho, and the food was Outstanding!! Very creative and full of flavor. Since it was restaurant week we all ordered different things and shared to try a variety of things. We tried all the appetizers, the bacon pork loin, wagyu skirt steak and salmon for entrees, and both desserts. For appetizers I would definitely recommend the Lobster grits. This was a delicious dish, full of flavor and textures it pleased in multiple ways. For the entree they were all really good but I enjoyed the wagyu beef the best. Beautifully presented, with two types of potatoes including a mash and some shoestrings that reminded me of the shoestring chips we used to enjoy when I was a kid. For the dessert, definitely recommend the Meyer Lemon meringue. All I can say is.... WOW!! The perfect mix of sweet and tart, with some salty graham crackers and fruit for garnish. It was so delightful and enjoyable I wish I had a spatula to eat up every spec of this!! If you gave me a large bowl of it I would eat the whole thing. My mother in law who doesn't typically like sweets ate her entire dessert as well.  Overall a very enjoyable meal and would highly recommend. If you're lucky enough to read this review soon get in here this week for restaurant week to save some coin and enjoy!",

I can't put my finger on what exactly made the experience so blah- it was a combination of the lethargic ambience, mediocre food and average drinks. That being said, there was also nothing terrible, thus the three stars (I probably would have given 3.5 stars if had the opportunity). I dined here on a Friday for lunch and I have heard that Saturday is much more lively and exciting. At the very least, I would give this place another chance on a weekend for brunch.",

I enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli to start, the pork chop with asparagus and polenta for my entree and the peanut butter cheesecake as my dessert.  What a treat and such a steal at $33/person!

The menu includes appetizers, main dishes, and desserts.  The apps range from $6-12 or so, the main courses are up to $25 or so, and desserts were around $6-12.   Everything we ordered was super tasty!    Location: Inside Hotel Valley Ho. There's self-parking and valet.  The restaurant is in the tower, under the fitness center.   Food:  The meal we ordered included grilled asparagus, a spaghetti squash dish, drinks and dessert.  The grilled asparagus with parm cheese was made just right with a bit of cheese and salt.   The spaghetti squash dish had cheese, tomatoes, and other vegetables and was made quite well.   For dessert, I tasted a strawberry shake which was delicious and fresh.  I ordered a dessert wine that was sweet and smooth. Other options included pies, other flavors of shakes, etc.   We ordered a margarita and a martini. The martini was some sort of strawberry with  a hint of jalapeno. It sounds odd but was a nice mix.   Service: The restaurant was not really happening on a Sunday night at 7:30 PM, but the server was super attentive, friendly and helpful.    Ambiance:  Retro decor with little booths and tables.

    "text": "My wife and I spent a weekend at the Valley Ho recently so we decided to try the restaurant especially because of all the good reviews here on Yelp.  We didn't have reservations but we were directed to a table in the lounge bar which features the same menu which by the way is quite varied from simple sandwiches to gourmet entrees.  Our table was directly across from the lengthy mid century bar so it was perfect for people watching.  The crowd was noticeably upscale, well dressed and surprisingly young for what amounts to an \"old fashioned\" hotel.  Perhaps young people admire the fun and hope filled 60's when dressing nicely was expected and cocktails were king.  I had a pastrami sandwich and a beer which was real good.  My wife loved their kale salad even though I don't get the attraction or popularity of that green leafy stuff.  It appeared to be a nicely prepared salad with loads of salady accoutrements and a tasty dressing.  This is a fun place to go to.",

They also always make my dog feel friendly Mandy always gets him water and attention. I'd highly recommend  dinner or  a drink anytime!!",

Cute, retro ambiance!! A very unique interior, and one of the highlights as other reviewers mentioned.  We had the mimosa bar, which was so fun! They give you a glass of champagne and you pick the juice (peach, orange, strawberry) and condiments. They also have a bloody Mary bar with even more choices which looked fun. They also have free chocolate chip scones to start which were delicious!  I got the Frittata and my friend had the Arizona omelette and it was good - she loved the potatoes and thought they were well seasoned. I loved the frittata!! It came with tons of veggies and was so flavorful. By the way, prices are super reasonable - mimosa bar was $8 and generous portions. Food is comparable to other places in the area.  Service was a tad slow but otherwise we had a great experience, and would highly recommend!",

Eggtastic, breakfast club, fill in the name of a place where you sweat outside until a table opens up. That was such a lame thing to do in 2002, I'm no longer permanently hungover with limited options. We came upon this restaurant when we stayed at the hotel. It's beautiful! The restaurant at Valley Ho has great ambiance, comfortable seats, delicious and nicely prepared food and great service. We now go here for breakfast whenever we are in old town Scottsdale. I love their ice tea that comes with a cup of nectar and lemon juice with a mint leaf. For my meal I order the BLT add fried egg with a side of home made thin cut crispy potato chips. I love sitting in their cozy booths and people watching.  I'll be back... sans hangover next time!",

Our group ordered drinks and we hung out for the rest of the night. I ate the key lime pie and it was really good. Maybe a little too rich, but it's not a bad thing.  It's off the main area of Old Town Scottsdale so it's tucked away and more quiet. :)",

I definitely want to take a tour they offer of the hotel, rooms and grounds for the throwback price of 19.56 so we will be arranging this for another time. It's not just a hotel but an adventure.

It's like taking a spoonful of Jiff creamy peanut butter and coating it with chocolate ganache and charge $6 for it.  Hubby got the sundae topped with whipped cream and sprinkles...nothing to rave about.  I don't know what type of coffee they served, but they could use a better brand.  The three star was really for the acoustic guitarist duo who played all genres, unplugged.  They made the night fun.

    "text": "I've been coming to the Ho regularly since it reopened.  I frequent the bar, restaurant, spa, and/or pool area at least a few times a month - mostly for dinner or brunch.    The menu is mostly classic American fare set in a hip, relaxing environment.  The restaurant is perfect for any meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, drinks, happy hour, special events- you name it, they got you covered.  Brunch: I'm not a morning drinker, but the Bloody Mary bar looks lavish - you could make a meal out of that spread!  To continue the indulgence, try the stuffed french toast or poached eggs benedict.  The cheesy grits are another guilty pleasure. Lighter appetites will love the breakfast parfait or sliced fruit plate.  The fruit is always fresh and beautifully displayed. On Sundays (I think...it's changed over the years), ZuZu provides complementary, fresh-baked scones with your meal.  Dinner: Like brunch, it's hard to go wrong.  Our fav's include the burgers, the chicken and penne, the artisan cheese plate, the orange and ginger crusted ahi, and the farm fresh veggie of the day (often I just order the veggie for dinner and steal fries from my BF).  The complementary dinner rolls are salty sirens of white bread goodness - take THAT you cruel, gluten-free world!    The ZuZu menu has evolved over time and for the better.  A few items we miss and would love to eat again include the happy hour BBQ spare ribs and the chocolate cupcake.  The service at ZuZu is impeccable.  My only minor criticism is the hostess asks me if I'm a guest at the hotel and for last name EVERY single time I visit the restaurant.  If you keep putting my last name into the computer, can't you see how many times I've been there?  I don't expect special treatment, but a simple \"good to see you again! \" would be cool.  The one exception is Esther, who works in the restaurant and always chats with us when we come in.  Those little gestures mean a lot.   Regardless we are TOTAL fans of Cafe ZuZu and the Valley Ho and recommend it highly to visitors and locals alike.  Thanks for making my neighborhood a better place!",

My favorite drink is the \"bourbon smash\" but the \"hot n dirty\" is the best bang for your buck. You cant really go wrong with any of the drinks as they are all strong... its just that the \"hot n dirty\" has a little more kick to it :)  The appetizers are pretty big too considering its a happy hour menu. My favorite appetizers are the chicken drumettes with the honey bourbon sauce and the artisan grilled cheese with the brie and fig jam but the prime rib dip comes in at a close 3rd place. We loved the artisan grilled cheese so much that we began making it at home for and afternoon snack.  We ordered 5 appetizers, 7 mixed drinks, and 1 large bottle of Pellegrino and the total bill came to $46.30 (i am also going to upload the picture of the bill). The funniest part is that the water was the most expensive thing on the menu.  We left there stuffed, drunk, and had money left over in our pocket. We have been back several times and will continute to go there.  I hear they have an awesome brunch complete with bloody mary bar.  you can view the happy hour menu here:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotelvalleyho.com%2Fpdf%2Fzuzuhappyhour.pdf&s=da177de1787aa0f121edc896eb9186714edb5ea522f28d93b759206e3d16d1b1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hotelvalleyho.com/pdf/zu...</a>",

I had my friend taste it as well and his eyes lit up like a dried out Christmas tree, so I know it's not just me. He had the eggs benedict and also enjoyed it. It had a great (possibly house made) English muffin along with avocado and perfect little poached eggs. The fried potatoes were also crispy and perfectly seasoned. I also indulged in the DIY bloody mary bar, which was delicious. There were a lot of ingredient options and even bacon! I would just say that they need to add Worcestershire sauce and they'd be golden. The service was good and prompt and the staff were all very friendly. It is clean and the building is beautiful. I can't wait to go back! [$30 for two people]",

There are also several appetizers on the Happy Hour menu for $3.   I went there for a friend's birthday on a Tuesday, and the bar area was very crowded when we got there with some business guests of the hotel, but once it cleared out we had a really enjoyable time at our table. The atmosphere was very comfortable and our server was really friendly and smiling which is a plus.   I'm pretty sure we tried every single appetizer on the Happy Hour menu. I kinda have a simple taste, so I really really enjoyed the Bruschetta and I had THE BEST Grilled Cheese ever!! It had apples and a fig jam which gave it a different but awesome taste like you would never imagine on a grilled cheese. The only thing to keep in mind is the appetizers are very small. I didn't mind this, but my guy friends ordered about 4 appetizers each to satisfy their hungry stomachs. The grilled cheese was very tiny and only came with 2 sandwiches, but again it was absolutely delicious so I would suggest ordering at least 2 orders of it if you want to try it.   I will definitely be back to this happy hour!!",

The bar had fun vibe for hanging out. Then moved to a circular booth in the restaurant. I ordered the spaghetti squash. It was the best meal I have had during this visit to Az. It was very flavorful and satisfying. It had a spicy tomato sauce and had colorful small half tomatoes in the sauce that were cooked just right. The spaghetti squash lay upon spinach that also was cooked just right. The husband had the veggie burger which he liked and from the couple bites i had, was good. From what i could tell it was prepared there and not from a boxed veggie patty you can get at a grocery store, if ya know what i mean. I can't say enough how cool this hotel is. It's retro Mid Century Modern. If you are interested in architecture and design, the authenticity is incredible.  Good service throughout our experience.",

    "text": "Having champagne taste but a Champagne of Beers budget is a real drag sometimes.   $15 mixed drinks can go kick rocks and $12 apps that feed one can take a flying leap. That's why I adore happy hour. Remember when Tempe Caffe Boa had a real, real good one? You got the hip but sophisticated atmosphere, great eats and drinks, and could walk away well-fed and pretty buzzed without having buyer's remorse the next day when you realized you spent your week's lunch money.  Well Cafe ZuZu you are the new mecca for my budget conscious but discernable palate. I have always adored my visits to Valley Ho - I'm a suck-suck-sucker for modern design and decor and a stroll over the grounds and through the lobby are like a Mad Men fan's dream: the cozy fireplace surrounded by couches for relaxing with your drink, the lounge-y area just outside the bar is intimate, comfy and gorgeous - appropriate for a date or a small gathering of friends -- the open layout means you can look from one end of the hotel to the other and all the way up to the third floor ceiling. The music was 60s lounge and energetic without killing the easy vibe. Oh, did I mention the $3 drinks and food menu?  This is really impressive. Three bucks a pop can get you a single serving of braised short ribs (juicy, tender and falling right off the bone), or some mini grilled cheese sandwiches of brie, green apple and fig jam (I'm a huge fan of Postino's prosciutto bruschetta, and this reminded me of that, the perfect blend of salty and sweet but even more buttery and savory, and with a hint of tart) or a decently sized prime rib sandwich w/ au jus...to name a few items. On the drinks side, I love the variety. Most HH mixed drink menus are all \"martinis\" that are neon green or hot pink and sickly sweet. Not here - get a refreshing Blackberry Bramble or Gin Fizz (that's two of six mixed drinks on special) or a glass of wine (about 4-5 choices) for just three dollars. I ate and drank to my delight and spent $15. Um, wow.   Service was great - friendly and competent and not at all weird about our ordering 2-3 drinks at a time to take advantage of the deal, or deciding to order yet another appetizer because they're just so damn cheap.  Oh ZuZu, thank you! Every pauper wants to feel like a princess, five times a week, from 4-7.",

    "text": "Holy effin' eff! Best happy hour anywhere in the valley!   Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.  I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now.   The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples.   Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small.   Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails!   The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, \"It'll getcha drunk!\"   The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour.   Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!",

    "text": "We had such high hopes.  Cafe Zuzu was a huge disappointment today.  The decor was the best part of the meal.  From a lethargic, disinterested waitress to a kitchen staff that required 45 minutes to serve undercooked food to the only table waiting for service in the restaurant, it was just a sad experience for our family.  After waiting 40 minutes, we approached the hostess for help with where our food might be.  Why the hostess?  Because our waitress had become completely invisible.  We looked but could not find her.    When the food did arrive, it came in spurts.  With three people serving, you'd think they could get all the food out at once.  Alas, they could not.  We all had to wait another 10 minutes until the entire party was served.   Now for the food.  We ordered burgers, a sliced turkey dinner and some chicken fingers.  The burgers were the best of the lot, made with an excellent quality beef patty, delicious cheese and a tender bun.  The sliced turkey was god-awful horrid.  It clearly wasn't carved from anything resembling a real bird, but was some type of formed meat buried under a half cup of salty canned gravy.  An assortment of fresh steamed vegetables were the best thing on that plate.  A side serving of mashed potatoes was another miss.  Clearly reconstituted, the potatoes were tasteless and without proper texture.  I've had better when visiting Grandma in the nursing home.  The organic greens salad was excellent; not so for the torn iceberg salads which could have been made by a three year old.  The onion rings were greasy but good.  The wonderful salted dinner rolls were the hit of the night.  next time I visit Zuzu I may just buy a basket of bread.  Now for the final insult, for some reason, our waitress served us room temperature water without ice.  Who does this?  Why?  The management tried to make apologies for the kitchen, and we would accept them, if it weren't obvious that the problems with the food and service were not limited to our table.    Whoever is the manager of Cafe Zuzu, please take note:  you can do so much better.  We came for the wedge salad and great burgers and got \"torn\" iceberg (it was clearly chopped) and undercooked burgers that arrived cold.  Please, talk to your staff.  They're going to put you out of business if they keep performing like this when you're not in the building.  Hope you do better for us next time.",

My friend and I sat at the bar and we were surprised when the bartenders ignored us after they had served our beers. We finally had to ask for some food and although we both tried different items from the new menu, they did not compare.  Maybe it was because it was Friday night, but it was extremely noisy with people standing in a group or leaning across us to order at the bar. I have sat there many times before and have not had that experience but it seemed this group of young people were very loud.  Sorry to say I will have to mark this off my list of places to take my friends and to stop extolling its virtues to the people I meet.",

It's a pretty big brunch menu with items to satisfy kids to entry-level foodies to those annoying health couscious people.  The service - They take reservations and actually honor them!  The hostess and manager were super cool about letting us load up a booth meant for 4 with our 5 selves.  Our waiter was the best - we had one of those guys in our party that insists on waiting and waiting before ordering and usually ticks off the wait staff because he'll send them away 2 or 3 times before he's ready to order - waiter showed the patience of Job and kept up the refills too.  The food - Here's a breakfast for you:  layer of buttermilk pancake, dollop of banana pudding, another pancake, more pudding, one more pancake and pudding topped with bananas and real maple syrup on the side.  Over Easy should take some lessons from Cafe Zuzu's chef.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Everyone else loved their food too, though other than the eggs benedict and burger (both great), I don't know what all the others got because my attention was laser focused on the pancakes.  Oh - talking about the pancakes almost made me forget they gave us a basket of bread when we sat down.  I don't know if it's the same every day, but in it was some kind of scone-thing with cherries and chocolate chips that was outstanding.  It's in the Valley Ho hotel, so the easiest way to park is to valet, which is free for Cafe ZuZu customers.  The valets sometimes forget and try to charge, though, so be sure to remind them.",

    "text": "Wow..I can't believe the level of disappointment... First, we eat out quite frequently, yet, don't bring snobbery to the evaluation. So, yes, our waitress was very nice and accommodating, yet, the food, the drinks...set a new low in our book. My daughter ordered the grilled salmon and it arrived, swamped in some kind of relish mixture.  Even though famished, she had to back off after a few bites. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and was greeted by 3 pieces of dehydrated iceberg lettuce, along with some kind of crusty chicken mixture..I quickly returned  it, a behavior I rarely exercise. The Long Island I consumed clearly was created from cheap alcohol blends and other than the delicious French fries, this meal set a new standard for \"low\". Ambiance is the only salvation and garnered the 2nd star. Stay away..you have been warned. Only eat this food if you are deeply intoxicated and have lost the capacity to be discriminate.",
