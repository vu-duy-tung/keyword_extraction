There wasn't a long wait in line to grab food, or a long wait for them to cook your food! The resturaunt is clean, and the interior is roomy and doesn't feel cramped. They have vanilla, chocolate, or the vanilla chocolate swirl froyo in a cup or cone included with your meal.  The on on McClintock can't compare, but they are usually backed up with families. Since this location is a little more \"hidden\" you can enjoy a quiet night with family or friends while you enjoy your meal :)",

I found YC'S on yelp and it had good reviews. My husband was leary when we first walked in because there was no one at the counter. The super nice waitress/hostess was helping a couple of first timers (like us) with their selections. She was very nice and showed us the ropes and even mixed the sauce up for me. The portions were HUGE! My husband who usually can eat his full meal had to throw in the towel halfway because it was too much food. We both have hearty lunch portions to take to work tomorrow. The soup bar was excellent especially the wontons. For only $23 they provide you such a great 3 course meal. They even had swirl cones for dessert. The hostess made sure we enjoyed our meal the whole time and even let us have free to go boxes since it was our first time. She even threw in a small box so I could take wonton chips. The customer service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend this location!!!!",

You decide if you want the small or large bowl and whether or not you want a return trip to the grill. If you do it right, you only need one trip but its really good so if you're really hungry or want to overindulge by all means pay the extra buck something and go for two.   Fill your bowl with the meat, vegetables, & sauces of choice, pressing the contents of your bowl down with the supplied wax paper sheet to get all you can in the bowl as it'll condense greatly on the grill. They have recipes on the board you can copy or create your own. A staff person can help you create it if you have questions. Hand to the guy at the grill and he'll mesh all the flavors together, and hand it back to you steaming hot. Grab some spicy beef soup (taste like egg drop with beef bouillon with some kick to me) and you're all set. Free yogurt cone (dinner only) tops it off nicely.",

I actually went her on accident, I couldn't find the place I had been planning on going to so I went here instead.  That turned out to be a very good idea.  It's only about $10 and you can go through the buffet as much as you like, there's a couple different soups you can get, drinks and an ice cream machine too.  The bowls for the meats and veggies are HUGE!  It was nice being able to fit everything I wanted into the bowl the first time and not having to make multiple trips.  They have a very large variety of sauces and a sort of menu of how many spoonfulls of each different flavor you need to make specific sauces (orange sauce, teriyaki, etc.).  The staff was all friendly and made sure that everyone knew how it worked and gave recommendations for the sauces.  The guys grilling the food were really fast too, not that I would mind if it was slow since it's so much fun watching them cook everything.  The food itself was sooo good!  I don't know if it was the mixture of sauces I used or  the noodles or what but it was better than the other Mongolian restaurants I'd been to before.  I'm definately going to be returning here although next time it will be on purpose!",

    "text": "As far as Mongolian BBQ places go, YC's is pretty damn good if you pick the right combination of sauces.  Basically, you can get a bowl for 10.75 or you can pay an extra dollar and get all you can eat. It really depends how you feel. You can try different varieties of sauces and just get small portions throughout or you can pack it into one bowl and hope that you pick the right sauce that you like.  I got the all you can eat because... it's only a dollar more. I ended up getting only two bowls worth, but I honestly don't miss that dollar.   They offer a variety of meats - beef, chicken, pork and fish. I was really disappointed that they didn't have lamb because most places I've been to do. They also have a good amount of vegetables. I usually add bean sprouts, celery, spinach, onions (lots and lots of onions), mushrooms and scallions. Sauces - LOOK AT THE BOARD. I guess some people miss it, but they give you a good number of combinations you can do to make the type of sauce you want. Curry, orange, thai, sweet and sour, mongolian, etc etc. I got the X-pao which basically is a mongolian sauce with a kick. I added some hot chili oil to put in some more, but I like spicy food. I really liked the X-pao, definite recommendation.  On the side, they offer some rice, soup and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. Drinks and dessert (ice cream) come with the meal. Grab it and enjoy! (Only warning is that this place is greasy... as all mongolian bbq places I've been to are, so go in there knowing that!)",

    "text": "I'm really bummed, Yelpers.  I spent a solid 8 years in New York City where, shockingly, they don't have Mongolian BBQ of any kind.  I might as well ask for a unicorn as much as ask someone for Mongolian BBQ.  Growing up, we used to go to this exceptional place in Virginia Beach called the Genghis Khan that was the benchmark for all of my subsequent mongolian BBQ experiences.  It was all you can eat, fresh, tasty and came with delicious soup and this crazy homemade sesame bread (I know - sounds weird from an Asian restaurant, but this bread recipe was super authentic to the region, apparently).  Long story short, my idea of Mongolian BBQ is apparently a far cry from YC's.  Don't get me wrong - the meat and veggies are fresh, the place is super clean and the service is quick.  But shouldn't all of that be a given?  The myriad sauce options are a bit overwhelming if you don't know what you're doing (I was ok saucing for myself, but my husband was confused - good places have a person whom you tell how you'd like it and then sauce for you).  Since the place isn't all you can eat, if you mess up your sauce on the first go, you're stuck with your dish.  Major bummer.  In addition, the whole concept of cramming as much food into a bowl as possible with wax paper and strategizing on how to get the most bang for your buck is really off-putting.  Shouldn't you be able to try different things, graze and casually eat without having to think out your choices like a friggin' game of chess?  Or have to worry about getting a doggie bag for later?  YC's should be a game show the way people scramble to fit as much as they can in a bowl.  The soups are odd - seemingly leftovers from the buffet mixed with broth and then called \"wonton\" or \"spicy beef\".  The crispy noodles were stale and tasted of used oil.  We didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  A friend who's lived here all his life heard of my search for good Mongolian BBQ and responded \"Why?  It's horrible.\"  I was kind of shocked given that a) he's a good eater and food critic and b) all of my collective experience having Mongolian BBQ up to my going to YC's had been so very good.  I just didn't understand.  Now I'm wondering if YC's is the area's benchmark for which all Mongolian BBQ should be compared to, maybe I should just give up.  It's just not that good at all, and this coming from the girl who'd break off both sets of arms and legs to have even a decent bowl of Mongolian BBQ at this point.  No fair, YC's. No fair.",

So I guess you better know how many eggs you want before you pay for your all you can eat bowl. Second there is no way to taste test any of the sauces, the girl actually told me I could put some in a small bowl, taste it with my fingers and then she would give me a wipe to clean my hand so I can taste the next one. Third, why in the world would you put your noodles on the line instead of behind the grill, just to fill the bowl up quicker? For some reason the sodas are included, which is no bonus for someone that drinks water. Wonder why the bottom of your bowl looks like soup, watch the guy cooking the food throw water on it and cook for like 30 seconds.  The selection is small, the quality is low, the service is poor. Don't waste your time or your money.",

The cashier was very helpful and gave us a tour of the ingredients to choose from. The only thing I wish they had was more standard options, like lo mein noodles, orange sauce and ginger roots. Even though it's healthier fare, I had also wished that they had a normal soy sauce along with their low sodium soy sauce. Other than that, I would say this is the perfect restaurant for a quick and healthy lunch or dinner.",

Way more expensive than similar set up's that offer more.  Nothing was grilled - only steamed.  While the items were fresh, they lacked flavor.  With all the other choices available, we won't be back.",

If you pack the bowl the best you can and have it almost overflowing when you bring it to be cooked, you'll have enough food for your trip and 2 more meals later. Very fresh food with a great variety and friendly service.",

So I've been looking for someplace new to replace it and saw this one while driving around and thought I would check it out. Overall, everything was pretty good. They have a nice selection of veggies, noodles, meat and sauces to choose from. I didn't try any of the soups but my bowl was pretty good. I'm sure I will be back again now that I understand the process a little better and have tried the food.",

    "text": "This is one of our family favorites when in the mood for a huge flavorful and inexpensive meal.  The food selection is substantial and the quantities are limited only by your skill in filling your bowl.  Suggestion: you can use one bowl for food and another for your sauce if you like - no additional charge.  Start off with meat: chicken (both white and dark are offered), pork, beef and fish.  Pile on the veggies: (little corn on a cob, lettuce, carrots, onions, sprouts and more I can't remember), add noodles (three kinds are offered, I like the wheat) and then create your personal sauce or select from a dozen or so suggested varieties on a big billboard.    A large selection of sodas and several kinds of tea are available at a fountain and rice, soup and chips top off the buffet.  Your selection will be cooked in front of your eyes on a huge hot stove and warning - it stays hot for quite some time so use caution when forking it into your mouth.  What would normally be called wait staff in any other restaurant are very efficient and will assist in food selection or fixing any issue you might have.  They have always been pleasant and helpful when we have dined there.   Two suggestions: buy some take out cartons (50 cents each) when you enter because you will need them.  Even after cooking the food quantity is large and few diners exit without their \"Fido bag).  Secondly, leave room for yogurt.  Not just yogurt, Nanci's Yogurt.  The best there is IMHO.  They feature vanilla (my fav), chocolate (wife's fav) and mixed in both old fashioned cones or cups as you prefer.  Note: yogurt is included in the dinner price but is slightly extra at lunch.  They also have senior pricing for us seasoned veterans.  Provided everyone in your large group likes Asian buffets this is the ideal place to eat.  Everyone gets their favorite food and the price is right.  Plus, there is almost always enough to take home so you get at least two meals for the price of one.  The dining room is very large but not very noisy so good place for both adults and kids.",

First and foremost I was greeted like I usually am by not one but two different hello and welcomes from the staff working that day. Julieta was the one that met me at the counter and as I have read in previous reviews her kindness and absolute professionalism was impeccable. Upon a brief conversation about my last visits she was very thoughtful and considerate and really went far above any customer service I had ever received at any establishment like this.  She really honestly made me feel like a valued customer and I honestly couldn't speak higher about the customer service she provided.    When I got to the food prep grill with my bowl in hand the cook greeted me with a kind hello and the issues I had the last two times were absolutely not at all present this time. The cook was very attentive with the food he was preparing,nothing was lost or wasted in prep, I honestly could tell the effort was being made. A tray was provided to allow me to move everything to a table, and of course the food upon completion was exceptional.   Everything about this visit was incredible and I could tell that all my issues previously had been addressed in a professional and timely manner. I highly,highly recommend.",

For this trip , I grabbed a large bowl and a to go box, put some beef in the bottle of the bowl, hit it with some great looking veggies, didn't skimp on the mushrooms or onions either, piled on the wheat noodles, drizzled some hot chili oil on top, sprinkled some cilantro and pineapples on it, in a smaller bowl hooked me up some spicy Hunan sauce (which I make a tab bit more spicier than whats on the overhead menu, gave it to the guy and watch the magic happen while my lunch was being prepared! Walked to the side, grabbed a bowl of brown rice and some fried won tons & sweet sour sauce!   At this point, I halved my rice & bowl of food into the to go box to make sure I have lunch for tomorrow and lunch for today! Can't beat that! 2 meals, one price! Just word of advice, if you think you might need a to go box, get it when you 1st pay, it makes things easier! I promise!  Yum Yum YCs, looking forward to the next time I come back!",

    "text": "Oooh I love this place.  I used to frequent the Tempe location on Southern and McClintock, but yesterday was my first time at this particular location.  It's extremely nice and spacious, definitely a lot newer than my previous haunt but they seemed a little understaffed last night.  Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night, but there was only one girl running the register, showing the newbies how the place worked, and cleaning the dining area, while the other girl was cleaning up.  Needless to say, most customers who came in had to wait a while before being rung up.  Now on to the good stuff, the food.  How it works:  You walk in, pay for your meal - about $13 for dinner, grab a tray and a bowl, and fill it up!  It's like a buffet of raw food.  First are the meats which are frozen and thinly sliced, but you're provided with little paper sheets to help you push down the food in your bowl and stuff as much as you want in the bowl.  Then the veggies will take up pretty much all the space left in your bowl (if any), and finally your choice of three different types of noodles.  Honestly, I think loading up your bowl is an art.  Especially when you get to the noodles and you're faced with this balancing act of piling noodles on your tray, I mean bowl.  You also get to mix up your own fantastical, magical concoction of sauces (I might be having too much fun here) which you will then bring to the chef with your bowl/tray of raw ingredients and they'll fry it up all up right in front of you!  After you get your bowl back, now transformed and cooked to deliciousness, head over and get yourself some rice, soups, chips, drinks, and later (it's hard to resist) ice cream!  I know what you're thinking, how in the world am I going to stuff this into my tummy?  Doggy bags.  $0.50 per box, but so worth it cause you will have food for days.  Okay, like another meal or so.  So if you're a college student who loves food but is short on cash or just love a good deal, YC's is gonna be your new best friend.",

The store was very clean, staff was lovely, the food was amazing, and the experience was wonderful.",

We were promptly welcomed in & got started through the line. The item buffet was clean & well-maintained which was very pleasing. Obviously as it wasn't too busy, we got our food very quickly & were ready to eat.  The price includes a bowl of food along with some other items such as soup & ice-cream. I opted to get the chicken & vegetable soup (not sure what the official name is but it was chicken & vegetables in broth ... tasted like chicken noodle without the noodles) .. It was kept warm & tasted good. The bowl was also good. It was my fault that I didn't put enough sauce in the bowl so there was some water sprayed on my food to cook it. I guess my only complaint was that the sauce flavors didn't come through as a result of that, but I still enjoyed the meal.  We will be coming back to this location!",

We happened upon YC's as there was a Taco shop nearby without a soul in the place so we decided to pass on the Taco's because no people in a restaurant scares the hell out of me.   We enter and a nice host explains to us how it works, we grab our metal looking dog bowls and proceed down the food line adding our raw goodies such as meats, sauce, veggies, noodles and the like. Smash it down smash it down, get as much in as possible into your doggie bowl!   We handed our bowls to the cooks and within a minute or two voila!, we had our tasty meals ready to go. Grab your own drinks, some rice and soup also if you like and enjoy your meal. Price was $13 or so for a large bowl, a couple dollars cheaper for a small. The large bowl I polished off with no problems and was nice and full while my girlfriend ate about half so you do the math. Will go back again most certainly and will try to smash it down even more. Yummy Chow!",

Meats include: chicken (white and dark), pork, beef, and a fish option. Maybe I'm forgetting one...? Oh well....move along and shove as many veggies as you can and then smush and stack as many noodles as you can on top. Up next, grab another smaller silver bowl and fill with any kind of sauce creation you could think of. Luckily the staff are ready and willing to help make your sauce. Then carefully waddle over to the cook and watch him \"play hockey with your food\". That basically means he puts your creation onto a giant, bazillion degree hot surface and uses these paddles to cook it all to perfection. After being amazed by the cooking process, stumble to a table and eat! Also included in the price: soft drinks and iced tea, two kinds of soup with wonton crisps, and white or brown rice. Wait! I forgot there is also chocolate and vanilla ice cream available! Wooo! There is a 50 cent charge for a to go container if you want to take your leftovers. If it's your first time, the container is free.  I will acknowledge that I had an upset tummy after eating here but I'm willing to give it another shot as it could have been unrelated. I wasn't in too much pain....haha",

The place looks very confusing to new comers, so it's always good to go with a YC's veteran to show you the ropes. :) Take as much meat as you want, as much veggies, noodles and then it's up to you to make your own mixture of saucy goodness before handing it over to the good people that man the frying station. They have a plethora of great ingredients to make a delicious sauce for your stir fry. Ginger, Orange, Garlic, Sweet and Sour, and lots others. Above the cooking stations are steps to make different styles of sauce, but I always like going with my instincts and making my own. It's just more fun.   They also have soup, chinese noodles and white, brown rice to go with your meal and a drink comes with the cost. Love that.   I always leave full and usually have lots leftover to bring home. Its fun to get creative with your food here, watch it being cooked, and loving how it tastes. All for a great price. I can't say enough great things about YCs.",

The service was okay, it depended on the person helping us down the line. The lady in the front was somewhat strange, she looked at us weird and acted awkwardly. She asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, she asked our friends, who had. She then proceeded to say that they could explain how the process work cause it was kinda long for her to do it. There was no one waiting behind us in line, so I thought that was a bit rude but not a big deal.   The idea behind the place is pretty cool! I've been to places like this before, but the selection of ingredients to put in your plate was very extensive in comparison.   The lady by the sauce station was very friendly and professional. She explained how to mix them and helped us out.   The cooking part is pretty cool. They have a round grill in which they spin your food around.   The portion sizes (if you fill your bowl up the right way) are a good size. It would not have felt somewhat pricy if I would have liked the food more.",

YCS even charges for a to go box REALLY?! REALLY YCS?? You want to charge me because i actually got somewhat full? You can expect my presence to be scarce! It is a disappointment to me really. I would rather pay for all you can eat with mouth watering quality Mongolian than someone who charges for every little thing. What are you gonna do next YCS? charge for a ladle of soy sauce?!

It is now $11.50 to eat dinner here. Even the lunch prices are outrageous, $9.50 for one trip. We stopped coming in awhile ago just because of the prices.  I always liked the food though. Vegetarians FYI, there is seafood stock in the YC's own sauce. I didn't know that originally but found out a few months after being vegetarian after I contacted the corporate office. They told me that the fish sauce and the YC's own sauce are the only two sauces with animal ingredients. Their veggies always seemed decent though.  Here is a tip: If you pack your bowl super full, enough that you know you can't eat it all, get your food to go. I would do this and they would put all of my food in two containers and I wouldn't have to pay the extra $.50 for the take out container they charge.",

Being that you're supposed to choose your own food/sauce, including the amount, it should be my fault; however, the nice young lady who works there made my sauce. There's a menu board of how to make your sauces, but since there are two meal sizes you can choose from, I think they need to re-doctor those recipes to fit each of the sizes. I feel like I'm eating spicy soy and sesame sauce soup.    I think the price is pretty reasonable for everything you get: meal, drink, soup, great service.YC, re-doctor your sauce recipe and I may consider my return.",

The downside of that however, is that if you don't make a good flavorful combination, you're stuck with it (unless you go buffet-style).  At YC's they have a standard price for a bowl of stir-fry, but for an extra dollar you can have it all-you-can-eat.  The price they charge for a bowl includes drink and dessert, which is nice.  Unless you haven't eaten in days, I would recommend sticking to the single bowl since that is more than enough food for one person. \r \r They have a pretty wide selection of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and turkey.  At dinnertime they bring out cod.  I do wish they had shrimp as one of the stir-fry ingredients though, since they have such a limited selection of seafood.  YC's has a good selection for vegetarians too, since they have a wide array of vegetables, and have tofu for those wanting a little more protein in their meal.  \r \r For those that prefer rice over noodles, they have white rice and brown rice at the counter where the soda fountain is.  They also have soup at the counter.\r \r Once you've stuffed yourself silly with your own tasty concoction of stir-fry, you can head over to the ice cream machine for some soft-serve.  If you can't finish your meal, they do have take-out boxes, but they charge a small fee for them (a dollar I think).",

The food all looked fresh as we went through the food line selecting our favorites and stacking our bowl to the sky. We selected our sauces and turned it over to the grill.   The cook doused our dishes with water, quickly cooked the ingredients, and returned them in a new bowl.   There is a selection of crispy wonton bits, rice and soups for you to add to your tray at no cost. I selected no rice as they were all old and burnt to the pan. I chose the hot and sour soup because it is ma favorite.   Free-range and refills on beverages.   Sat down to eat, was not impressed. I could not muster to try a second spoon of the soup as it was absolutely disgusting. The bowl of ingredients were all bland, perhaps from the overuse of water at grilling, and I am almost certain the tofu had gone bad, The slivers of meat that my husband had selected tasted fowl as well. We obviously did not get to far into our meal before leaving. Had we not already paid there would have been several complaints from me, and changes in selections.   We could have taken the left overs home, but opted to leave them instead.   Suffice to say, I do NOT recommend.",

All of the employees seem to really like working there and they are always exceptionally friendly.   The food portions are enormous if you pack it down into your bowl (I recommend doing son). Get a small bowl on the side for your sauce (you don't have to fit that into your mess of veggies and meat)! and that makes everything a lot easier.  As for flavor I think it's pretty good. I don't recommend going off in your own direction on the sauce, follow their recipes. Every time I've done one on my own it hasn't been as good.  If you like this concept though and want more for taste then go to Genghis Grill. The portion is slightly smaller but the taste is much better.",

The staff is always super friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the variety of food never disappoints. I have absolutely no complaints for YC's.",

You get to pick your raw ingredients and they cook em up for you right there. The food tasted pretty good but as far as the quality of the raw ingredients I wasn't very impressed.   I actually would recommend this place for someone looking for a very fast meal (since the wait time is close to zero), and it's True that it's healthier than a burger joint, but I guess my bar for \"healthy food\" is just much higher than this place.",

I have never written a review because I was eating there before I had ever visited Yelp, but recently they added a new \"Thai Peanut Chili Sauce\" and several seasonings that you can add to your food (IE: lemon pepper, cumin, and some combination spices).  This is a great improvement, and really increased my impression of their overall quality.  With these new improvements, I would say YC's is the best Mongolian BBQ I have personally had.",

    "text": "I've got a broken ankle so I'm staring at my walls for way too many hours each day. My sweetheart's been concerned for his safety so he's getting me out & about at least once a week. We (*I*) decided we should start trying out new places for food.  Last night he asks if I've ever been to a YC's. He'd been to one in CA years ago. I hadn't, so I checked out the reviews here, liked what I saw (especially the fact they were still open... Sunday night & I was starved!). Also found out it's less than a mile from home so even better... food... NOW!!  ** THE SERVICE **  Went in on crutches & the gal asked if we'd been there before... no, we haven't. We ordered 2 large bowls. She explained how it all works, even showed us how (& encouraged us) to smash as much food as we can into the silver bowls.   When we got to the spices, she came back & explained the menu board (if you find a mixture you like, you can repeat it the next time), asked me what flavors I preferred, & proceeded to help me (I told her what I liked... she put it in the bowl).  Once I had my all my ingredients, she carried my tray to the grill area for me & went back to help my man navigate the spices.  The guy at the grill tossed everything on top & started mixing it all together. It's always fun to me when I get to watch people cook my food!! I get to see how it's done (I suck as a cook but it's nice to know it CAN be easy!) & I know exactly where my food's been before I start eating... a win-win in my book!  In less than 4 minutes, I had a huge bowl of piping hot Asian food in front of me!! The nice gal came back & carried it to my table, got me 2 bowls of rice, a cup of iced tea, & an extra one for refills so I wouldn't have to have my man chase down more for a while.  NOTE: Don't expect this type of service!! As I said, I went in on crutches. Even then, I was still amazed at the extra help. I loved it because my man didn't have to keep interrupting his meal to make sure I had what I needed!!  ** THE FOOD ** I just can't say enough. The food is super fresh. The meats are shaved so you're not dealing with the chance of fat/grissle/ick that you sometimes run into at Asian food restaurants (yep, that'll ruin meals for me). You pick exactly the veggies you like (this is the first time EVER that I've had Asian food & haven't had to pick thru my food & end up throwing away half my meal!!).  AND, you get exactly the flavors & heat level you want. We're both super spicy people. But no matter where we order \"extra spicy\", we just don't get it. That didn't happen here! We both used the chili oil to what she called a \"level 8\" & you could actually taste the spice (next time I'm sure we'll be doing a 9 or 10, but it was really good at the 8 too).  ** PORTIONS ** I thought we'd done a good job at stuffing our bowls. But after seeing what others were doing, I know we can do better next time! LOL  But even with what we did, the bowls were full. He ate all of his... he's one of those guys who likes to feel full when he goes out & he was more than full when he finished. I ate about a third of my bowl & brought home leftovers that'll be good for another 2 meals for me!  They offer both brown & white rice. They have soup which I can't comment on since neither of us had any. And they have soft serve ice cream if you save room for dessert (how can you NOT save room for ice cream?!?). I got the twist kind with one of those tiny cones... VERY good!  ** CLEANLINESS ** The place was super clean. One of the gals was training a new gal & was literally wiping down ALL the walls. The tables were all clean. The guy at the grill was constantly cleaning the cooking area between customers. Everything you want in a food place!  ** PRICES ** Between the 2 bowls & the tip, we paid $30 for dinner. When I asked the gal for a takeout box, she let me know they normally charge 50 cents for them, but since it was our first time (so I didn't know to ask), she gave me one. For the amount of food, I'll pay the 50 cents!  We saw on the way out that we could get \"Unlimited\" for $1 more. We'll do that next time so he can have leftovers too!!  ** SIDE NOTE ** I asked my son this morning if he'd ever been to a YC's. He likes Asian food, but he's a super picky eater (aka doesn't eat any vegetables). So I figured it'd be an awesome place for him to go since he can pick and choose what's in his meal.   His text back to me? \"It's f***in' amazing!\" Really? He knew about this place and didn't tell me? I fired him as my food advisor!!  ** BOTTOM LINE **  We will definitely be going back soon!!",

She came up with perfect combinations for me and my son. He ate his entire veggie stir fry, and mine was delicious. She came by while we were eating to make sure we liked them. We came in about an hour before closing and the restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and I was pleasantly surprised.

The distinguishing difference that makes or breaks the situation is \"sauce game\". In this occasion, the sauce game is relatively weak and it's clear that the staff knows that because they meet you when you get down to that point in the self-serve line where they jump in and try to assist you however the assistance still yields blandish un-flavorful finished product. A majority of the staff was friendly including Julia and Alicia and the manager guy however my noodle bowl was something that I could probably make at home. The chicken wonton soup was the highlight of the meal. Shame on the dish washer! It was quite an unpleasant interruption to the vibe when I had to go through the dishes to inspect for a clean bowl.",

I loved that they had soft serve ice cream...crispy wontons..... soup..... Well, nothing has changed! YC's is exactly as I remember it from years ago. The only thing that changed is it's actually a little pricey.... over 10$ even at lunch. Closer to 15 at dinner. Extra charge for a to go box (which is 100% necessary....trust me). Anyway, I loaded my bowl with all kinds of veggies.... added some of their weird freeze dried beef (it looks weird, but it tastes good, so who am I to judge)....piled noodles on top.... and poured on various sauces including a ridiculous amount of chili oil and garlic. Don't get me wrong, this is no authentic Asian food restaurant....but the flavor is pleasant regardless. Between my noodles, two different types of soup, and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce I was super stuffed and had two additional meals from the leftovers. I would definitely return...but probably only at lunch.",

As I approached the sauces, the nice girl who greeted us appeared and asked if we would like help picking our sauces. After asking us what flavor profile we wanted, she very professionally ladeled the sauce combinations into a bowl and directed us to the chef who greeted us with a smile & \"How are you today\"? We watched him in intently as he cooked our dishes (with giant chopsticks!). Complimentary soup, rice, and some type of chip was also a nice addition. Our dishes were hot & DELICIOUS!!

She even gave us helpful tricks.  I love the sauce creations and recipes on the big boards. The waitress was friendly and came by to take plates/bowls off our table. The price included everything! ! Great concept for a \"buffet\" style restaurant.  We will definitely be back.  The only limitation is your stomach!",

My girlfriend and I were so impressed by her kindess and hard work. I even had a conversation with a lady at the fountain drink station who was overwhelmed/ impressed by Juliets outstanding work ethic. Any employer should feel blessed to have her on their team!

    "text": "So after a long day of work and school, I was looking for a place to fill my appetite for something Asian. I looked through the restaurants near me and nothing new or of interest came up at first. I saw the pictures for YC's Mongolian Grill and my mouth started to water. Since it was only a couple of miles away from where I was, I decided to go check it out.  Walking in, I was definitely underwhelmed with the decor and overall ambiance. Nothing really blew me away visually, but I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant. I was greeted by the person at the register and they explained to me how ordering worked. Since I was a newbie, I appreciated the hospitality. I paid upfront for my bowl and was directed to the buffet style food prep area where I could fill it with vegetables, noodles, and sauces. The price for the bowl was on the pricey side (about $12) for what I'm used to for noodles but considering how much food I packed into my small bowl it was definitely justified. There were people behind the food counter to answer any questions I had about some of the foods that I had not seen before and were very helpful. I especially appreciated the wide variety of vegetables they had considering I am a vegetarian. They had the meats and veggies separate from each other which earned them extra points in my book. After I picked out my vegetables and noodles, I was helped with creating my sauce. They had a menu of options I could mix together to curate my very own sauce that was unique and personable. I loved being able to control my spicy/savory/sweet levels in my noodles. The chef cooked it all up on a heated plate right in front of me which made the whole thing into an experience I hadn't seen before, and I went to my table after grabbing complimentary wonton snacks. The waiters were polite and checked up on me often, and even offered fountain drinks that were complimentary. The food itself was phenomenal (I partly pat myself on the back for creating such a good sauce) and the veggies tasted fresh and not frozen. I will definitely be coming back with friends for the value of the meal, the friendliness of the staff, and overall experience of being able to build my own meal.",

I do wish the bowl sizes were a little bigger especially because food generally shrinks a little when cooked. They have a wide variety of meat and veggies they don't offer veggie noodles like some Mongolian grills do. The atmosphere is casual and the restaurant is well kept. Sometimes i order to go and there is a .50 Togo charge per person. I will keep eating here :)",

Friendly and helpful staff, great atmosphere and very clean, and even with the crazy long line on a Saturday night, our bowls were cooked and we were seated within 15 minutes! With no restrictions on how much you can stuff in your bowl and all the extras included, I have no problem paying an additional $.50 for a take out container.

She guided me to the food area and described the best way to dish up. Also, her station wasn't crowded right at the door front like other YC's.   The offerings were fresh, filled and inviting. They, like others, have a suggested sauce menu but this trip I just went crazy and tried a little of nearly every sauce. Should have stuck with the menu but it was still tasty.   The soup was strange. Plenty of beef, which is hard to find sometimes but the consume was a bit weak. Nothing a bit of soy couldn't fix. They also offered plenty of herbs and seasonings at the end, which was a nice touch.   I recommend this YC's to anyone who wants an easy, tasty bit of oriental cuisine. BTW, I was thru the line and at my table in 10 mins.",

The quality is always top notch, and with the ability to create many dishes from the various ingredients, it's entirely possible to never have the same meal twice. Plus, I can get the big bowl, eat my meal, and take the rest home for another meal or two later on. That's a definite win.",

My daughter has a soy allergy, and the manager gladly told me everything that was cooked in soybean oil (most dressings). They also cook the food on the grill in sesame oil, which I appreciate. they cook the food and get it out very quickly.   Their kids meal would be a great deal for little kids. They give you a very small bowl and charge $.50 per year of the child's life. It wasn't nearly enough for my 10-year-old and would not have been worth $5, but it would be a great deal for kids 5 and under.",

    "text": "I love this place! I always visit it when my wife is dragging me to Ikea.   Walking in you get to see the simple menu. They have options but all I see are the small bowl and large bowl options I opt for the large bowl. Cashier is always helpful and friendly and offers help if needed.   Walking up to the bar first comes the meats. They are shaved into thin meat slices so you gotta grab some wax paper sleeves and be ready to stack up the meat like you are creating Mount Everest! Don't worry about the weird looks you might get from other customers, real pros know you gotta work to stacks all the meat that you want.   Next comes the veggies, this can be a little difficult because they don't often stack as well so you gotta pick what you want well. Yes, use the wax paper to push it down!  Next come the noodles, and if you have done it right the. The noodles will be completely above the brim of your bowls and make everyone look and think \"What is this guy doing?\" don't you worry thought, you do you!  Then you have the sauce, they have chalkboards above the grill to suggest what you will need to pull off the flavor you desire. Make sure to grab one of the bowls above the the sauce station, this way you can have plenty of room for your sauce and not have it drip all over you. I suggest adding a couple scoops extra of sauce so that your giant food mountain has enough flavoring to go around   After all that is said in down now you hand it off the to the chefs and let them work your magic. Be sure to tip them, because what they do is art!   After it's all said in done it's now time to eat. Again, the staff is helpful if you need anything but otherwise it's time to enjoy the food.  If you've done it right then you will have plenty of leftovers, go ahead and pay that fifty cents for a to go box, it's worth it.   I highly recommend and suggest you go! No regrets!",

They have some wax paper as well so that you can try to pack as much in the bowl as you can. Then the vegetables, they have a lot of different vegetables. Then the noodles, if you can fit any after you get the prior goods. Lastly, there were a wide variety of sauces. You take it to the cook then they put it on a round grill. Since I had it to go, they also gave me a carton for rice and a cup for a drink. I wish they would've given me a plate for it was difficult to eat it out of the carton.",

So, just go ahead and purchase your takeout box (.50) upfront. It's worth it for the portion size of a large bowl. Service at this location was great, everyone greeted us, offered to help make sauce, and checked on us after we got a table. I will certainly be back soon!",

I like the concept of grab how many that you can LOL :-D it's fun to just put how many you want in your plate or should I say bowl! haha. So you get to choose what you want for your stir fry- they have all kinds of meat, beef, chicken, pork..and they have cod fish too which is good!  So what I did was, I put all but beef haha!   and of course there's different veggies to throw in. You get to choose the kind of sauce you want..I like mine super spicy!  and the last part is for them to cook it for you which is so much fun to watch watch. Hubby went crazy and over loaded his bowl and when the time for them to cook it, they ended up having to grab 2 bowls soon as they're done cooking for him! haha Yeah, he's not very hungry that time LOL ^_^ I also like the unlimited rice,soups, drinks and frozen yogurt. We really had a great dinner here and we are surely coming back again! Highly recommended! Come here and give it try and you'll surely love it!",

She was no where to be found when I was ready to make the sauce.  The bar was messy and when I brought my food to the grill to be cooked the staff at the grill looked visually annoyed to help me.  Also, the door was wide open to the back kitchen and there was an open view of the kitchen.  There was another YC's staff member who was moving uncooked noodles with his bare hands from one container to another.  Bare hands!

Food is typically good, but prices keep going up. For two of us on a Saturday evening is was $33 including the built in tip (suggested tip, that is) on the new fancy register system that many establishments seems to use now.  I doubt that our visit will be as frequent because it is pricey.  Consequently we smooshed whatever we could to make the most of it and got a to go box. (I think they still charge a $1 for one.) This way we could get more meals out of it and in my money conscience mind, if we can get more meals out of it, it brings the cost of a meal down.    There is one other thing that gets me because I'm a germ-a-phobe. People serve their veggies with large spoon. The spoon handles are frequently placed on top of the food itself. Does this mean their hand germs are on my food?  I try to appease myself by saying that whatever germs there are on the veggies is cooked off from the high temperatures. I\"m not sure this is right but at least I can eat my meal. I don't know how this should be handled health wise or what the health department codes is, but I am cautious.   Service good, the establishment is clean and staff friendly. We will probably go here once or twice a year based on cost.",

    "text": "This was so good I wonder why Mongolian BBQ hasn't sprung up in every city (hint, hint Alabama!) When you go in you pay for either a small bowl ($9) or a large bowl ($10). I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal.   The ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.  Can I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldn't waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!",

    "text": "This place holds such a special piece of my heart. I've been eating at YC's since I was a little kid. Back when they only had the one location on McClintock...old school. Ive eaten here so many times, Im pretty sure that I am personally responsible for their being able to open two other shops around the valley.  When I was in high school, my youth group made this place their chapter eatery and I literally ate here every single Wednesday night. It also became a tradition to stop in here after a long weekend convention. Now that Im all grown up and advising for that youth group, it comes as no surprise to me that the tradition has continued with the chapter who still comes after each large regional event.  I love the food here, and its a bit of an experience. The first time you go, you should try to go with someone whose been before and has some experience. The price isn't cheap, but it justifiable if you know what you're doing. Ill give you a few hints: 1) Pile it high...REALLY high!. Not kidding. WAY above the edge of the bowl. If its a challenge for your noodles on top to balance, then you've done it right. This should wind up being 2 or more meals for you. 2) Get a separate bowl for your sauces. A lot of sauce is your friend because so much of it is going to be cooked off. 3) Try to avoid veggies that cook down too much like cabbage and spinach. Too much of it is gonna turn your mountain-o-food into a bite-size portion. 4) If you like as much broccoli as I do (thats a lot people), ask them to cook yours \"well-done\". Otherwise the stems on the broc dont cook all the way through. 5) Syrup. One of the \"sauces\" is syrup. Dont underestimate this because it will make your sauce nice and thick and awesome. The rest of the experience you will have to figure out for yourself ;-)  So why not 5 stars? Well its simple. I dont get to come all that often any more now that I live in Tucson. Every time Ive been more recently, it seems theyve figured out a new way to make a bigger profit at the expense of their customers. First, a long time ago, they started charging for ice cream. Then they started charging for to-go containers. Then they got rid of the \"return visits allowed\". Most recently, they got new smaller bowls. They've also raised the base price probably 4 or 5 times since I was younger.  One other thing I will warn you of, and I apologize for the graphic nature of this, but this place gives me (and all my friends) some serious shits. Theres nothing wrong with the food or how they cook it, but for some reason it just happens. The fact that its still worth it for me, in my honest opinion, should speak volumes about how much I must like this place.  Great option for vegetarians (beware fish sauce in the YC's own) and meat-eaters alike. I will continue to come back as long as Im around and/or they are.",

Also, the ingredients are always fresh, the cook staff are fast, and everything is delicious.  If you are a newbie, follow a recipe... If you are adventurous, try lots of YC's own, black bean, Garlic, Szechwan, and a little sesame oil.   I started out on Kublai's Mongolian BBQ in Hong Kong. If I had one thing to change or add to YC's it would be to include an egg as an ingredient, white rice as an ingredient, and fried tofu as well.  Great place!!",

    "text": "Food is great.  This was my first time.  The line was long, like 10 people ahead of me, but it moved farely quick.  I ordered the Large lunch bowl.  I guess the idea is to pile it as high as you can.  So when you get your bowl, grab a few paper tissues to use for pushing down your stack. Be careful because if you push on the side instead of the center, it will spill out... I learned from experience.  Then you create your item sauce. There's a menu of how to make your sauce as you look up to your left at the sauce area.  I really appreciated the lady that worked there.  She asked if I'd been there before & I told her no, so she offered to make my sauce.  Very polite.  I got mine to go so you have to tell the guys that are cooking it that you want it to go.  Then you get to add more stuff, like cilantro, peanuts, chili, and other things after or before they cook it. Then you go to the rice & soup area.  The only unhappy thing is they didn't offer a to go soup container,  but a worker noticed me putting soup in my to go box & she said it wouldn't work to we'll and she offered to get me a new to go box for my rice and brought me a to go soup bowl.  So that fixed my problem and because the food is fresh, and the service is extremely polite, I give this place 5 stars.  Lastly,  the price is a little more than average but you get so much.  You can feed 2 to 3 people if you stack it.  There is no sharing, but if you get it to go, you can do whatever you want.",

And some say oh you only get to go up once. But that only makes it better, half of the fun is making your plate as big and high as possible. And lets be honest going up many times you are still not getting as much as you do when you get to take it to go. Its smart marketing by Genghis Grill but you really arent getting the same amount as you would at YCs. YCs does taste great and It is the only place that I consistently go on a weekly basis. Even if it is a little expensive it is totally worth it.",

    "text": "Yc's is so great that I frequently go there for lunch with my coworkers. I suggest getting there around 11 a.m. (or after 1 p.m.) to beat the lunch crowd because the line will often extend out of the door by noon. The atmosphere is lively during lunch and the lunch crowd is comprised of a diverse range of folks, from high schoolers, college kids, to professionals and the elderly. I wouldn't suggest going there for a power lunch business meeting because it can be hard to hear over the rabble at times.   The meat is frozen in thin strips, but I actually like that because it means I can cram more in the plate! Use the waxed paper that's placed off to the side to avoid touching the uncooked meats while you squish them down in your plate to get value for your money. Do the same with the vegs you add -- you're not going to care once your meal has been cooked and it's subsequently being consumed and digested! Stick to the recipes unless you feel comfortable experimenting with the sauces, etc., and can cope with, or enjoy, the results.   I've found that Mongolian BBQ works out well for kids. They all seem to enjoy being able to participate in making their own dinners. Definitely stick with one of the milder recipes, though, and go easy on the chili sauce or CPS may pay you a visit.  All in all, I've always had a very positive experience at the restaurant and rate it with four stars as a result.",

To tell the truth the other places that don't have super cold meat kind of freak me out.  The staff at this location are always really nice and help out all the new new people who have never been before.  I have taken several friends when they come from out of town and they always think it's a cool place.  The lunch bar is pretty great and always quick and fresh to get in and out of for me. For Dinner they have more options which is kinda cool, but disappointing since I always go for lunch. I'm not sure how many different combos there are for sauce, but there ate several boards listing all the combos.  They all seem to taste similar though no matter how I mix them up.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The standard menu includes rice, soup, and desert ( FROYO like Ice Cream ) which is a fairly good deal.  I highly recommend this location.",

It is afterall the amazing shrinking meat.  Lots of choices in meat, vegetarian options, noodles, and sauces.  Once your plate is cooked, you can head over to get some rice or ice cream too!  This meal typically last three days for us.  And for $10!  The only reasons it did not get 5 stars from me is it isn't always quick service at the cooking stations and buffet area tends to get messy if not frequently checked on.

You walk in and the bubbly hostess/mgr offered our assistance b/c we had no clue what to do. Very clean place. She walked me through the line to show us how to add the protein of your choice (freeze dried?) and all the veggies, noodles and she added my sauce concoction. I chose dark meat chix, chix breast, tofu and beef. For veggies onions, mushrooms, brocc, tofu, whole wheat noodles, rice noodles and whatever else I could pile on. Than I told her I like Sweet and hot sauces so she added mine on top. you swing to the cook and he takes your plate which at this point you can add pineapple, peanuts, cilantro. 4 min later walla food is done! you can go to the bar and get soup, crunchy Chinese wonton thingy's (the best) and a drink. Dessert is froyo!!!! all for $8. Go hungry and take home leftovers. I did!",

The cooking area was very clean, and the cook prepared the food quickly and cooked it just right.  The vegetables were cooked, but still just a bit crisp, and all the meat tender.

Other than that they definitely carter to vegetarians, they have a card you can take so the guys will clean the grill prior to preparing your food in case of allergies or you simply don't want your tofo/veggie creation cooked in meat. I would also prefer little cups to pour my sauces in rather than in the bowl to gain a better picture of how much sauce I'm using vs actually need.

A small bowl was $8.95 and a large bowl is $9.95. You basically try to stuff as much food as high as you legally can into this small bowl and have the chiefs cook the food in front of you, with 2 GIANT STICKS. Who doesn't think that is cool? It's pretty fun and challenging.  Anyways, The sauces there are excellent and have many variety of choices. There is a person on standby to assist you in choosing the correct sauce for your meal, in case you don't know what to pick. Avoiding an sauce mix up disaster.   Eating here is significantly better than eating at an fast food restaurant. Also drinks, and soups are free. Including refills.  Service at this restaurant is excellent, 5/5 Stars. The waiters are very consistent, helpful and very aware of your needs. 50 Cents to order an take out box. Not a big deal. Not to mention, the girls who work there are cute.  To sum up:   Pros: Excellent Customer Service, Fun to go with a group of friends to try to out stack everybody else. Free refills on soup and drinks. Chief cooks for you with 2 sticks. Good value (if you can stack the food high) I recommend this restaurant, if your up for something new.  Cons: If you are new to this restaurant, and you don't know how to stack up the food, This may not be a good value to you. or if you prefer an real restaurant vs this type of restaurant. The food isn't as good as an normal restaurant, but given that this isn't an normal restaurant, This is not an drawback.",

We had never been to YC's and may or may not have stopped in but with the coupon we figured we would give it a try.  We were so amazed and pleasantly surprised.  The food was exceptional and the gal that helped us was so sweet and answered our questions.  Since it was our first time in, we weren't sure how things worked, she patiently explained and helped us out.  After we had sat down with our food and were eating she came by to check on us.  Everything was delicious and we will be back many many times.  The value for what you get is amazing.  Thank you for a great experience with food and service!",

The bowl of vegetables, meats, and noodles are covered in a sauce concoction you can create on your own or one the staff will help you create. I went with the YC's house sauce, which turned out great. They conveniently display the ingredients to create the sauce on a dry erase board above the giant wok cooking area. The staff toss the stuff you crushed into the metal bowl, onto the cooking stone thing, splash your sauce on it, and move it around with a giant stick until it cooks. Maybe I need to get out more, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this place.  Pretty interesting place to grab some lunch with a few friends. Good deal for the amount of money you pay. They did followup and ask if the sauce turned out well and everything tasted alright. That's always good to have happen.   I would point out, you should probably stick with one sort of meat unless you want to mix cod in with your chicken, pork, or beef. I could see how folks making their first attempt at this could make that mistake. I would bet that would taste pretty bad, not willing to verify that though.",

    "text": "Ever since I've been introduced to Mongolian Grill, I've been hooked. This is the only place I've gone to in AZ   I like that  the bowl of food is one price and includes rice, soup, drink and soft service yogurt. Kids price is based on age so you don't end up paying a ton for food they may not eat. If you need to go for round two, it's only an extra $1.   The staff has always been friendly and helpful and facility clean. The staff is willing to help get you the right sauce. I think this is helpful for people who've never gone or want to experiment.   I do wish this place provide a few more vegetable options and some more sauces. Some of the other locations I've gone too in CA or MD have double these items and can make for a unique dish.  My advise is layer and pack your meats, veggies to the best of your ability to maximize what you can fit into your bowl. I get meat, pack down, add veggies and then noodles and push down, add some more meat and then push down and then get cooked.  The grillmaster serves up your food quickly.  I've been lucky when I've gone it's been before the dinner rush.   Be careful when you take your food back as it will require some cooling off time.  Plan to head back many times.....  Kids might dig the yogurt, but I didn't like the taste.",

Others have described the process, and they're right. It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though. I will say the beef was better than the chicken (in my opinion at least) so I'll be sticking with that next time.",

They always ask if you need help with making the sauce which for a lot of people is the hardest part.  You also get rice, soup and soda with your meal. If you go in for lunch you have to pay for ice cream if you want it but I believe at dinner time its free. Dinner you have two bowl choices of small or large and for a dollar more than the large bowl you can get all you can eat. However, I am not sure why you would pick that option since a large bowl is a lot of food.   The only down side is if you want to go boxes they cost 50 cents. Although I have seen workers give these for free to a lot of people. I am just not sure how they decide who to charge and who not to.",

Though busy at peak times, they always get you through the line quick.   YC's needs a seafood night with lobster and shrimp etc. I'd pay allot more a coupel times a month to step it up.  As for the frozen yogurt, don't bother. They need to pick up the brand Sweet Tomatoes uses and add a little fixin bar and I would pay the extra for dessert.",

I am use to BD's so I knew the routine already and since I was new to this particular Mongolian place, I decided to go with the sauce called \"Chef's special.\" I loaded my bowl up with steak and chicken with a lot of veggies. Picked a few seasonings I use at home and at other places. The sauce bowl was huge which made me think they weren't flavorful if you needed 12 ladles in order to make the good good. The meat was very tough, the taste of the completed dish tasted old, freezer burned, bland, and generic. I was I pleased with the food, but the service was decent considering they don't spend much time interacting with their customers. Waste of money.   ***edited a few hours later A business owner saw this review and was very professional, I will give it another chance bc of the great customer service after my experience, that's how successful business's operate.",

    "text": "I actually love Mongolian grills.  We paid at the beginning for the large bowl. For the two of us it was about 30 dollars. We got our food (their ingredients are not expensive and we're definitely on the older side. Cabbagw, carrots, chicken sliced thin, beef sliced the same way, water chestnuts, sprouts, etc.)  We started eating. We had so.e left over. Now remember this is not a buffet. They have a specific bowl you have to put the ingredients you want into it. You cannot stack the food higher than a certain point. That is why there are two sizes.  Remember we already paid and tipped. Now I ask for a to go box.  They told me it will be 50 cents. Excuse me? They tried to tell me it's based on the concept that people can put an uncontrollable amount of food on the plate. That is a lie. They have the silver bowl in the beginning which is used to control the portion of the food. I have worked in restaurants and they are not going to get away with this, at least mot with me. Yes, sometimes people are able to stack a lot of food in their bowl.  But for the quality of the ingredients, the ingredients themselves and the silver bowls used to keep it from going over a certain proportion, couple with (if under good management) the fact that some people eat less than others it evens out.  For the amount I had would have only cost about 5 dollars. They are makin g a profit.  How dare you wait until we are happy, full, and satiated, and paid for to say we have to pay for to go bowls!  Your solution is that I should pay for the bowls in the beginning?! No. I will not pay for to go bowls. That is rediculous! We asked if we took to much. They said no. Well then why are we getting charged! They are making a profit. We were happy and you get business.... why did you ruin it on this? You are not a buffet. Even buffets have to go orders. You pay them fill up the plate as much as you want and leave.  It's not about the 50 cents it's the principal.  It's insulting. We did not take to much food, I didn't finish it so I wanted to take it home.",

    "text": "My husband and I had only been to the Southern YC's location which was nice and the service excellent and this location was no different...excellent!!!     We like this location better as it's much bigger and a bit nicer.  The staff is friendly and VERY helpful!  I had a bit of a hard time with the sauce mixing since I can't have certain oils etc but they helped in every way to make sure it was still tasty.  When I had a question on an ingredient on their frozen yogurt, the manager went to get the package so I could check it out.   The checked on us  throughout our dinner to make sure all was good which is unusual so yes, this place and it's management and staff deserve 5 stars!!!   We will be back!  :)",

    "text": "First off...I'm not a big asian food fan as I have seafood allergies, but this place makes it simple to accomodate, and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  This is the second time I've been to YC's when visiting the Phoenix area, and I highliy recommend it due to the fresh ingredients and cleanliness of the restaurant and super fiiendly staff.  You pile/cram your bowl full by selecting exactly what you like with choices of proteins and veggies, and they grill it all up for you.  The staff can help you select a sauce mix to your liking (accounting for your allergies and preferences).  The lunch/dinner deal is great in that it includes unlimited soup, rice and sodas, so you won't go away hungry.",

I haven't been back in to try things again but I'm confident our experience will be a positive one. Thank you to Geoff for your professional and friendly demeanor, it was a pleasure working with you.",

Once we walked in we were greeted by the prettiest and friendliest girl there! We were also first timers and she explained every step! Which was super helpful! She told us multiple times to fill up our bowl as much as we can lol! She encouraged us to overflow our small bowl. When we got to the sauces she was extremely helpful and asked us what we were craving and what we liked whether it was hot,sweet ,sour or all the above. She explained everything and which was her favorite! But she also recommended the popular one too! Getting to the grill the chef was all smiles and cooked everything in your bowl. Once we got to our table we were ready to eat! Everything was favorable and delicious everything was Cooked! Can't wait to visit Arizona again to come here again!",

    "text": "My husband and I came here after he picked me up from work, which was around the corner from here.  Price wasn't bad, $10.49 for the large bowl. Same concept as Genghis Grill, fill up your bowl as much as you can, select from chicken, beef, or pork. 6 or 7 pieces of shrimp is $1 extra. Then there's a variety of veggies to add into the bowl, then pick your starch, they had rice noodles, udon noodles and wheat noodles. After that you make your own sauce or the waitress/hostess can help you make your sauce.   There's also a all you can eat chicken or spicy beef soup and also white or brown rice at a little station.   Also included with the $10.49 is unlimited drinks.   The price sure wasn't bad, but I'd prefer Genghis Grill any day. They just have better options.",
