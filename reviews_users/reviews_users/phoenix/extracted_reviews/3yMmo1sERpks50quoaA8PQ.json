When we made reservations they asked if it was a special occasion. We were celebrating a birthday so she asked which complimentary dessert I'd like.  When we got there the owner said there would be no free dessert. I didn't want dessert but she was so rude about it. I am sorry to say delicious food can't compensate for an unfriendly staff.

    "text": "I had an interesting experience here after going to dinner for my birthday the other night. In response to other negative reviews, I had no issues with keeping our table for a long time (Granted it was a weekday) and the crowd at the restaurant was fairly diverse. I did not see any roaches  The food we ordered was great. My tortellini (admittedly super simple and hard to mess up) was perfect, the other people at the table said their food was great as well, although I unfortunately do not know what they got. I do know my tablemate only had 2 or 3 scallops and 3 shrimp with her meal. We also got the escargot, which was good and BURNING hot. The waiter warned us it would take a long time, which we said was fine, and I actually think I saw a busboy carrying our food out at one point and then turning around once he realized we didn't have our appetizers yet. I guess our food sat under a heat lamp after that, although it didn't seem to affect the quality.   The only part of the food my table didn't like was the brownie. I've honestly had better brownies from Pizza Hut. It was dry, tastless and boring. It looked like something made from a box. But to be fair you don't go to a restaurant like this for a brownie. The creme brulee was some of the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, although not the most authentic flavor, and if it wasn't for the rest of the experience it would be my reason to return.  They didn't sing me happy birthday, although they did for the table on the opposite end of the restaurant. No complaints here though, I hate when they do that to me, although my tablemates thought it was strange since it had been mentioned several times (including when making the reservation AND while we were at the table). My brownie had a candle, which was sufficient for me but different than my other experiences.  We had filled up on appetizers so we asked for some to go containers for our entrees. They took our food into the back (they had brought the container out to the table earlier when we boxed up our soup) and came back with several containers, which I didn't look at until the next day. That's when I discovered that I was somehow missing half my pasta. The bowl they gave me at the restaurant was the size of my head, but the styrofoam container barely had enough pasta to cover the bottom! Did somebody at the restaurant eat my food? Did I get someone else's leftovers? Who knows. Kind of a gross mystery, huh?  I didn't bother contacting the restaurant. I live 45 minutes away so I decided it wouldn't be worth it to drive back for a $15 plate of pasta, and I won't be coming back. I'm teetering between 2 and 3 stars. The food was 5-star worthy, but taking home 1/3 of the food I paid for was pretty disappointing the next day when I wanted leftovers.  EDIT- My tablemates just mentioned a weird situation that happened at the beginning of dinner. We ordered X bottle of wine and they brought out Y bottle. My tablemate argued that it was a different bottle, and eventually the waiter came out and apologized, said it was the wrong bottle, and that they were out of stock of the bottle we ordered. I feel like they should have mentioned that instead of trying to sneakily get us to pay Bottle X prices for the cheaper Bottle Y.  Also, the waiter never told us the specials, which was sad because my tablemate would have loved to order one of them. And I found my water glass empty more often than not.  Overall, it was a good experience (until the next day). I had a great time the day of, and would have given at least 4 stars if it wasn't for my missing food.",

I am always polite and tip well but it feels as though the second I walk in with other people my age I am looked at as a nuisance. I heard an old man call a young woman \"bitch\" after he made a comment to her about her age. I was in absolute shock. The old man continued to flip off the woman and act like a nut job. I am sure the staff knows who that person was since the older customers are commonly usuals. Absolutely toxic environment.",

We made a reservation and when we arrived, the place was quite full. The first sign this may be a new favorite dinner location: reasonably priced, good wines. Although they were out of the calamari appetizer, each of us was wow-ed by our meals. I had the scallop piccata. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the made-to-order sauce was to die for. Usually I don't take the last bit of pasta home, but I did because it was that good. My two friends has the blue cheese tenderloin (OH MY GOSH) and the shrimp scampi (fantastic sauce). We are already talking about doing dinner again. This place is a gem.",

We didn't make reservations so we ended up having to sit in the bar area. Turned out fine, excellent service from the waitress. (Poor girl was running her tail off as she had to take care of all the patrons by herself) I ordered my favorite appetizers in which I wanted David to try, Escargot and the Gorgonzola Portobello Mushrooms. We also ordered a glass of Pinot Noir to compliment the Escargot. He was amazed on the flavor of each appetizer. I believe his favorite was the mushroom. We have lived nearby for nearly 9 years and have never frequented this establishment. I finally stopped in for a quick lunch with my mother last month and found the atmosphere quaint & comfortable and the food absolutely delicious.",

    "text": "Wow, I'm so disappointed after wanting to try this place for so long! I've been going to The Blind Pig for years now, and have always wanted to try its sister restaurants but never got around to it.   We stopped in for dinner and there were lots of open tables. The hostess asks us if we have a reservation, we say no, and she acts like this is not going to be okay at all. She then asks us if we were okay sitting on the covered patio, which was our preference anyway. All I can say is, the first impression that we were given by the hostess was not a good start and she did not have a good attitude or pleasant demeanor at all.   Once we sat down, this was actually quite a nice and cozy spot for dinner. The wait staff brought really good garlic toast, but only gave us one at a time. I love bread so obviously this didn't make me the happiest. Our waitress was obviously very busy, as the table next to us ordered as we were ready to order but we didn't get to order for another 15-20 minutes. The waitress did communicate that she needed to visit other tables and take their order because they got there before us, but this was kind of ridiculous and I felt wasn't done efficiently. Eventually, we were able to place our order for penne alla vodka and veal milanese.   We waited SO LONG for our food. Uncle Sal's menu does say \"good food takes time\", but this took excessively long. The table next to us that ordered when we were ready to order literally ate their whole meal, chatted, and left before our food came out. When the veal finally came out after nearly an hour, it was not even lukewarm. The veal milanese was actually tasty and by that time I was so hungry that I ate it all. Then our waitress informed us that they couldn't find the penne alla vodka and it needed to be \"tracked down\" because someone else may have wrongfully taken it. After I finished eating my veal (about another 20-30 minutes), the waitress comes back with a new penne alla vodka, which did not taste right at all.   When we let her know, the waitress proceeded to apologize and offer dessert on the house. When my boyfriend asked her to comp his dish because he didn't even want to eat the terrible pasta he waited so long for, the waitress said she couldn't do that and she would have to get a manager in a very dissuasive way. The waitress then started acting quite rude in my opinion, going to other tables and saying very loudly that they were really busy and that their PATIENCE was greatly appreciated. I felt that we were more than patient, but I also don't feel like we should pay for a dish that we are dissatisfied with. Furthermore, we did not want to wait much longer since we had been there for over 2 hours and didn't expect dinner to take so long. When the manager finally came, we explained this to her. I felt that this manager did not do her job well at all. Her apology was insincere to say the least and she did not give us direct or definitive responses. After she left our table, we were expecting a bill that didn't come for 20 minutes and so we just decided to leave at that point. The manager didn't tell us she was comp'ing our entire meal, as we just wanted the penne alla vodka to be taken off our bill. However, because I told her about my cold meal she probably just comp'ed the whole thing.  Needless to say, I will not be returning here ever again and don't advise anyone to go here. There are MUCH better places, with MUCH better service.",

Inside, you've got your basic Italian restaurant requirements; homey decor with green and white checkered tablecloths and tongue-in-cheek mafia paraphernalia.  Beware of Friday and Saturday nights - they can get quite busy with the local crowd. With a small party, you can sometimes bypass long wait times by sneaking into the bar, where it's open seating.  I've found the food to be quite delicious and the service is usually good, maybe a bit on the slower side when they're busy. And yes, many of the diners are snowbirds and \"active adults,\" but that's part of the fun.  If you live in Scottsdale and want a good Italian meal that's as good as Maggiano's but close-to Olive Garden pricing, this is your spot.",

Typically, you get like 4 pieces of shrimp, a couple oysters and maybe a couple of other proteins; but, this dish was full of big shrimp, scallops, mussles and clams. Everything was perfectly cooked!  After dinner, we decided to share a tiramisu. Once again, perfection. Great way to end a great evening.  I will definitely be coming back...",

The casual atmosphere, helpful attentive wait staff and the wonderful bartenders make this a location which really reminds me of many of the restaurants I used to frequent back in New York.  The owner, Bobby is very personable, and takes an active interest in his customers.  I've had most of the dishes on the menu, and never would rate any of them less than a five out of five.  On the appetizers, some of my favorites are the mussels, the frito misto and the stuffed mushrooms.  On the entrees, I've had chicken there every way they have on the menu, from Cilantro to Ste. Marie; all four veals; both steaks, and every seafood dish.  All are delicious.  There pasta dishes are to die for, as are their calzones and strombolis.  Their cold sandwiches are delicious, but I've only had 2 of their hot subs:  philly and meatballs, both of which were delicious.  I would be remiss if I didn't give a special shout out to their bar menu.  Wow.  I haven't had everything on it, but most of them.  The strip steak is delicious, the open faced ground round is huge and perfectly done.  The butterfly shrimp, grilled chicken breast, scallops, and Italian sausage are all fantastic.  I go there a 3-4 times a month (only Jade Palace gets more visits per month as Uncle Sal's - and I eat out A LOT).  But when I first started going there, I had been there about 3 times for lunch, and as I walked in, the bartender, Mary Anne, remembered me, my name, and what I drank.  Love that in a bartender.  I've been there for lunch, for dinner; with my son, with a group; for business meetings; for special occasions; I've sat inside, at the bar and outside.  NEVER been disappointed.",

The portions are large, the red sauces have some kick and they pour you a generous drink.  Plus the place is a real value.  Best of all real people eat there, the botox level is very low.",

The waiter was friendly, attentive, professional, and explained the specials of the day.  He kept us totally happy, and you really felt like he cared.   The bus staff did a great job also.  The food was absolutely delicious.  A great evening out.  Totally enjoyed it.  Even commented later how nice it was to experience a restaurant that knows what good ambiance, food, and service means.  Seems you seldom find the entire package anywhere anymore.  These people do it right.  We will be going to this restaurant more often.  Can't wait to take friends there.",

    "text": "Update: The first 5 or 6 times I ate at Uncle Sal's it was amazing. However, it has gotten worse and worse since then. On our most recent visit (on a Tuesday night) it was pretty busy. After being ignored at the hostess stand for what felt like 5 minutes, I was finally told it would be \"about 15 minutes\" for a table for two. After 45 minutes to an hour, and after every other group of people who came in after us were seated, we were finally seated in that \"oh, shit, I forgot to seat these people who have been waiting way too long that even though I wrote their name down on the list I seemed to keep skipping over them for no apparent reason\". It was uncomfortable. We were finally sat in the back section of the restaurant where there were a good 5 or 6 open tables around us. After waiting 10 minutes for our flustered waitress (who never apologized for the wait or introduced herself) to finally come over, she asked if we were ready to order our food yet. Didn't tell us any specials, didn't ask if we have any questions, didn't even give us a chance to order a bottle of wine... We saw her one more time the rest of the night when she brought our check with out even thanking us.  Oh, and the food was disgusting on that night. My pene vodka tasted like frozen Michelana's, and my boyfriends shrimp fettucini alfredo was inedible. The shrimp were so over cooked they were hard and crunchy, and the alfredo sauce was so tastless and heavy it gave us both a stomach ache. At this point I was so annoyed I didn't even have the energy to complain to the arrogant host/manager that forgot about us for an hour.  Hopefully in the summer time it will have slowed down a bit and they will get their shit together. They obviously don't operate well when they're busy. It was like being on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares",

They totally catered to our off the menu request of an Alfredo, Spinach and creamy penne combo. Gave all the best bread, both garlic coated and plain, with olive oil and balsamic a girl or girls could ever ask for. I was going to add on wine to my dining experience, but figured I need to cut back on the alcohol, obviously its starting to do something to my psyche...   Not impossible to find, despite my iPhone's horribly given directions. Quiet and quaint, and def worth every penny, I will be back to Sal's in the near future. Just on happier terms I hope!",

    "text": "Not sure if they were off their game, but we went for dinner on my birthday and it was underwhelming. I've lived nearby for 10 yrs, my wife has been there, but now I know why we don't go there regularly.  First, we were seated pretty quickly, ordered Starters, and our entrees. Starters came out reasonably fast and nice and hot (Escargot). Then 15 min after we were served our starters, a 5-top was seated next to us. They got their salads rather quickly, and we still didn't get ours. After being there for about 55 Min, I asked the busboy (The server hadn't been around for a while) about our salads, and he got them right away. Must have been sitting...waiting... After another long wait, our entrees came out. Scallops and Shrimp were cold inside. Were they now rushed because they were late? (It was about 1:15 at this point). We also both ordered the same dish, and one had noticeably larger scallops than the other.   Stuff happens, But  the first excuse was that they were busy with a 65 person party, OK, I get that, they're busy for a sunday, but then I asked why the 5-top who was seated about 20 min after us had their entrees already and we just got our salads, we were told, \"well escargot does take a long time.\" I guess OUR escargot took longer than the one at that table. I don't like being lied to. Just tell the truth. Now I won't be back. Lots of great places to eat in Old Town.  There were a lot of \"regulars\" and tourists that the servers spent a lot of time chatting with. I certainly won't be either at this place. A shame, as it's just around the corner.",

The bread is not bad  It's thick slices of  french bread lightly toasted with garlic and butter.  I ordered chicken Marsala as I do nearly everywhere we eat Italian food. This one was nothing to write home about. I would say it's above average but not worth it for the price. My kids ordered Fettuccine Alfredo and it was phenomenal, but then, how hard is it to make that dish? My husband ordered the special they were having that night and was disappointed when it came out. The server had obviously not fully understood what went into the dish and therefor was not able to convey that to the customer (us).  I think this place is way way too expensive especially for being in a rundown strip mall. Some of the reviews spoke about a long wait etc... call ahead and make reservations. You will get right in.",

I'm accustomed to it being made with a light pillowy crepe, this version was with pasta so a little chewier and not as lush as I like. If that change was made it would be hands down my favorite Italian by far. Well I must say if not still the best Italian we have had in the 3+ years we have lived here and we have been to some really high end ones in the valley.

The french onion soup came with the meal too.  It was very good too, a tad but on the salty side for me.  The service was just a tad slow for refills.",

    "text": "After my failed attempt at the Blind Pig I jumped over to Sal's. After all, it looked like they were being attended to... and eating. Something that wasn't being done at the Pig.  When we walked in I thought we had walked in the back door - kind of, not really a normal hostess table. As it turns out this place was reservation only at least on the night we went. Even so, they checked their availability and sat us anyways. This took about 2 minutes to be seated despite our lack of reservations.  Within 5 minutes I had an adult beverage in my hand. If this was the Blind Pig then at this time I was still waiting on the sidewalk wondering if anyone was going to seat me. Night and day my friends.  So the service was good. And not just because the Blind Pig was terrible (read my review for that). They were good at seating us and the server was awesome.  The atmosphere was nice too. I'd call it casual romantic. Lights down, but families were there. Checkered table cloths instead of starched white.  Food was awesome too. Date and I shared a blanco pizza and each had a Caesar salad. I also got crab cakes as an appetizer. The Caesar was amazing, BTW. This sounds odd but I go out and searching for good Caesar salad. I've even went all the way to Vegas to try a salad someone suggested (OK I didn't make a special trip, but I did put it on my list of places to try when I went a few weeks later). This place's Caesar is for sure in my top three. If it tells you anything my other two are in Vegas and Prescott.  Anyways. The table bread was good. The crab cakes were great (wonderful sauce to compliment it). The salads were on point. And the pizza was demolished. The staff was accommodating and gracious. The patio was warm. Win. Win. Win.  Thanks Sal. Next time I promise to bypass the Blind Pig and just make a reservation with you!",

We spent $50 on drinks and shouldn't have to deal with a bartender's bad mood and a hostess who is less than honest.",

    "text": "Amazing service - they know how to take care of you here. You sit down and get water and one piping hot, crispy piece of garlic bread for each of you. If you had plans not to eat bread those will be completely annihilated with this stuff.  If you want a quieter part of the restaurant, which can be hard to get sometimes, ask for the back part of room right after the last door to the patio. It is a nice area with three tables that are very quiet.   The Gorgonzola Portabella mushrooms appetizer was a bit too soupy but delicious. One suggestion would be to have the grilled portabella mushrooms drizzled with the reduced balsamic and then offer the Gorgonzola cheese sauce in a little pot on the side. It came out looking like a big plate of slop - not an appetizing appearance.  Our server suggested an off menu item - Grilled Chicken Antoinette - the type of preparation offered for veal and it was great. Two chicken breasts with a highly flavored and chunky sauce of red peppers, artichoke hearts and olives on a small bed of pasta. Highly recommended!  The special bass with white wine, butter and basil sauce on fettuccine was light, yet flavorful.  There are reasonably priced wines but no cocktail menu, just standard drinks I guess, no hipsters here!  Food is always consistently good and you can't really go wrong here with any menu item.",

The bartender, Mary, had 17 customers and was taking care of everyone like they were the only ones there.  I had chicken piccata with salad and bread. The husband had chicken and broccoli pasta in Alfredo sauce. Both were delicious. My piccata was so tender it nearly melted in my mouth. The salads were just ice cold lettuce, one cherry tomato and grated mozzarella with a house Italian dressing. But that's all it needed to be. Perfect.   Great service, great food.",

So I went here with the most picky person I have ever met so you know it is probably pretty good if he likes it haha. When I went it wasn't too busy, the crowd is definitely older people, or at least it was at the time I went haha, but that is not a problem to me! We started off with garlic bread that was amazing, it was so extremely garlicky. I liked that though! Then came the salad which was good, but too much cheese on it, a problem that I don't think many would complain about but here I am. I ordered my go-to whenever I am out for Italian: eggplant Parmesan! It was tasty and filling, I left in a food coma for sure. Price isn't terrible and service was good, I would come back.",

But when I go to Sal's I usually come hungry.  I love the veal here, I have had it most of the ways they prepare it.  My favorite is the veal saltimbocca.  The prosciutto, spinach and mushrooms are a great combination.  The salty flavors and the sage seasoning make an excellent dish.  Hearty dinner salads with lots of little extras.  With the good portion sizes we never seem to have room for the dessert menu.",

The sweet drinks girl never missed a beat in terms of re-filling drinks glasses.  Our waiter was fast, friendly and efficient.  The stand-out is the ambience.  Even though located in a strip mall, the inside is a lovely wooden decor that is cool, dark and beautiful.  Our dinner salad was just ok.  Especially the cheese sprinkled on top seemed like costco shredded mozzarella.  After that the food got a lot better.  My daughter and I really liked their marinara sauce.  It was light, tangy and delicious.  My daughter's baked zitti was very good but the pasta was a bit overcooked.  My chicken parmigian was delicious.  Afterwards we had an incredible tiramisu which was large enough for 3.  The other amazing thing about this place is the price.  The food was so delicious--especially for the $26 we were charged for two.  The restaurant has a great vibe.  It was packed yesterday and everyone seemed to be having fun.  Keep in mind this is NY style Italian--not real Italian like Andreoli or Trattoria Veneto.  There are days when I only want NY style Italian and this fits the bill perfectly.  We will definitely be back.",

My first time to Uncle Sals I had the Marsala -- and I almost cried. I have been gong back ever since.  Since my appetite runs a lil smaller - I love to eat off the bar menu. Everything is $11 and under. Comes with side - may I highly suggest the green beans. I love the scallops or the steak, sometime I get the shrimp sauteed as well!

My preference was to sit in the well staffed and friendly sports bar area, even though many of the folks there were older in age. The bar menu was excellent and very reasonably priced. Most nights I had a good meal, a glass of wine and spent less than $16.00 plus tip. Sometimes I ordered from the entire menu. Although I'm fussy about Italian food, I quickly became one of the regulars. Very highly recommended.",

    "text": "We went here for my birthday dinner; it was a great experience overall.  The restaurant has a homestyle Italian vibe, it's almost quaint (I say almost because there are spacious booths and large tables, but it still has the feel of an intimate restaurant).  We were seated promptly.      The waiter remembered my fellow diner and was very welcoming.  He had a good grasp of the diverse wine list and helped us decide on a carafe of Chianti (it was my birthday, afterall).  As we decided what to order from their expansive menu of specialties, chicken, veal, steak, pasta and seafood dishes we enjoyed a basket of complimentary warm garlic bread.  The Parmesan cheese (in a jar on every table) looked tempting so we sprinkled some on our bread...delicious.    After much debating between the Chicken Champagne and the Chicken Diablo I decided on the latter, with whole wheat spaghetti and green beans and sauteed onions on the side.  My friend had the Chicken Cilantro.  A soup or salad comes with each entree; I had the soup of the day (eggplant bisque), which had just the right amount of body and richness--I'll admit, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got to try a few bites of the house salad with bleu cheese dressing--it was heavily dressed, but it was oh so good (I almost wish I had gotten that instead!).  Both chicken dishes were wonderful.  I asked for a side of the spicy marinara to satiate my desire for some tangy spicyness.    To conclude the meal I had the chocolate brownie.  It was drizzled with fudge and topped with blue bunny vanilla ice cream.  And of course, there was a lit birthday candle on top.  The brownie was divine; it tasted more like chocolate cake than a brownie, but it was the best damn cake I've ever had.",

    "text": "I met friends here for an impromptu lunch one afternoon. I was completely blown away! First off, this place has a 'real' Italian feel to it from the moment you walk through the door. The tableclothes on the cute little square tables even feel Italian! This cute little restaurant is housed in a strip mall area in Scottsdale. It's small , a little dark and quaint once you step inside. I met my three airline crew  friends there for an afternoon of catching up over lunch. Two of us wanted wine and two of us wanted dirty martinis. Let me begin by saying the wine was a healthy pour of vino! I am NOT complaining ! Our waitress was so sweet and she was Italian too! We just loved her! She was knowledgeable about the menu; she recommended dishes based on our likes and wants. She let us chat and take our time on ordering and that is important because in my group of friends and foodies, dining is a social thing and we have the gift of gab. We ordered a variety of dishes: I had the Crab Louie, priced at $10??? This Crab Louie had THE best louie dressing I've tasted outside of SF! It had the right dose of 'kick' to it to add to the flavor of the overall salad. Amazing! So much food and fresh, FRESH crab!!! My friend had the Chicken Milanese, we all tried it and it was divine! My other two comrades had the Chicken Piccata; I am always a fan of this dish, but I haven't found one here in the valley that I LOVE. This piccata, I loved! Those main pasta entrees all came with a starter of soup or salad; all generous portions. All very tasty! Get this, all the menu items are under $10 for the lunch menu. For dinner it seemed the menu was decently priced under $20 on average. Each of us had take home bags, if we wanted. But we all had stops to make and opted to leave our morsels of goodness behind. The freshly made garlic toasted bread that accompanies the meal is also a good way to blow some hard earned workouts. I ordered two calzones to take home for dinner that night. The Mediterranean Calzone (I minus'd the feta cheese it comes with), is stuffed with mozzerella, ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts, spinach, and olives; and the Special Calzone comes with mozzerella cheese, Italian sausage, and green peppers (I added a dose of pepperoni and took off the green peppers). Our wonderful waitress told me I could do whatever I wanted with the calzones; ANY combination at all! So, my dinner that night cost me less than $15 . I love when I find a gem of a restaurant to hang and be a foodie in the valley! This will now be my new 'go to' Italian place. This place has real Italian charm and taste and the price is right !",

I am not sure if our waiter was having a bad day or for some reason he just didn't like us but he didn't smile at us even once the whole time we were there. He was very abrupt and looked at me like I was an idiot for asking him what kind of meat is in the lasagna. I could live with that crappy service if the food was any better but the veal was by far the worst veal I've ever had in my life. My wife had the Fettuccine Alfredo and she didn't like it either. What a waste of $50 + tip for that grumpy host. Never coming back again.",

There's an awesome bar area that's elevated and separated from the regular dining area.  It has a wraparound bar with high top tables on either side. The mood is fun and the wait staff is awesome. The bar area has a separate menu with lots of great specials, but you can also order from the regular dinner menu if you'd like.  There is also a separate dining room that's quieter and has seating for larger groups.  However, in the dining room you can only order from the dinner menu.    The food is great, lots of selection and they bring as much garlic bread as you want.  The wait staff is friendly, helpful and very attentive.  They even package up the leftovers for you, in our case there was enough for another meal.",

    "text": "So a little background before I give my review. I'm very finicky when it comes to Italian restaurants.  Being from Chicago and going to New York and Boston many many times I have dined at some amazing authentic Italian places.    With that being said I think this place is a True hidden gem in Scottsdale.  It may not have the most ideal location but wow, they really bring it with the amazing food, wine, service and ambience.    I went there on a Tuesday and place was packed. Not overly packed but lively in a good way.  that's a good sign given usually Tuesdays are a restaurants deadest day.    Ambience: When you walk in you'll notice it's a dimly lit restaurant with dark wood.  The bar is a \"U\" shape with 2 tvs and its setup nice so you can chat with new friends you may find yourself meeting there.  The Old school pix on the wall are always in my opinion a good sign of an authentic Italian place.  In my opinion it makes you feel a part nostalgic.    Food: I had the shrimp and scallop dish w vodka cream sauce.  Healthy portion of shrimp and scallops and the pasta paired with it was delicious! I paired it with the Super Tuscan (they have many bottles or wines to choose from by the glass) followed by a limoncello aperitif that was sublime.   They offer steaks, chicken, veal, fish/seafood and pasta entrees so there's much to choose from which is why I can't wait to go back.    Service: I sat at bar and they had 2 bartenders on a Tuesday so service was prompt.  I asked to try a few of wines before settling on Super Tuscan and they were very accommodating.    Overall I highly recommend this establishment if you are looking for amazing authentic Italian and a cozy welcoming environment.  Prices are very reasonable as well!   Enjoy!",

It felt (in my opinion) the food took a tad too long ((even during the week, along with it being at lunch time)) and the wait staff needed an \"uplift\".

Don't worry I growled at her and she backed off so I could go about tonguing the sauce from my plate.

    "text": "This didn't go so well...YIKES!  Let me start from the beginning. . .  I made a reservation for 8 girls. It was a very special night for us--one of our very best friends just found out the sex of her baby, and wanted to reveal it to all of us together.   Things started off pretty slow, and by slow I mean I had to SHARE MY WATER with my neighbor (not big in the sharing game). Secondly, it took about 10 more minutes before I got to order my glass of wine. (This girl is thirsty)! Thank God for the big stack of bread they brought out--that cooled me down. Time to order...Since I had a work function before dinner, I wasn't that hungry so I asked my water buddy to share a meal with me. Lo and behold the menu says it's an extra $5 to share. WTF, but why? Needless to say, we decided to order separately- I got a small side Caesar and she really wanted the tortellini but right before we ordered they ran out. DARN. They had cheese ravioli though so she just asked for that but with the tortellini sauce-pretty close! Ravioli was $13 and the tort was $15, so we assumed she would just be charged the $15. Stay tuned for how that turned out. Salads came out and mine is a dinner size (not what i was expecting clearly) but the server then tells me that there is only one size. (I would have just not ordered one if I would have known). Then our entrees came out. I tasted her ravioli and it was great, no complaint on the quality or taste of the food. It was legit DELISH! But this is where things go downhill. . When the bill comes out - (by the way they don't have a POS and there is absolutely NO SPLIT CHECKS, real cool) - we look it over and see that her ravioli is $21, so we ask the server how this happened (it's about the price of the 2 entrees together)! She replies, \"Well since you switched the sauce its an up-charge of $5, and since you got the caesar thats another $3.\" Jesus, Mary, and Joseph -- yea I was beyond shocked and ticked off--and this was not even including my \"Caesar\" that just so happened to be full sized.   Basically, I think it's safe to say that I won't be back which is a shame because I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. :( This was not only the absolute worst service I have ever had, but never in my life have I experienced being up-charged with out being notified first.   Oh yeah, and then the server auto-grated herself 19%...I normally give 20% (even for bad service) but I think she maybe deserved 5 or 10% -- it was the service that ruined this experience in its entirety.   The one good thing that came out of this is ... It's a GIRL! and I got to spend time with my friends.  Bye Felica, xoxo  Allison",

    "text": "This is an intervention.  I rarely get myself involved in what I consider to be unfounded Yelp ratings, but this is necessary.  It is time.  Rock-bottom has been reached.  Uncle Sal, we care about you, but the first step is to admit....   Four stars with almost a hundred reviews?  Really?  There is NO WAY this place even comes NEAR other establishments in Scottsdale including Pig & Pickle and Citizen Public House - WITH THE SAME STAR RATINGS!!  Each to his/her own, yes, but for my money I'd avoid this \"4 star\" restaurant.  Let me tell you why:  As I often do, I checked Yelp for nearby eateries in Scottsdale.  Fine.  Cozy Italian-American seemed a nice stray from the usual for me.  APPS:  fried calamari and stuffed clams.  Clams:  way too heavy on the Progresso bread crumbs, hardly any clams, and the bread crumbs weren't even baked or cooked.  Dry and loose.  Yuk.  The marinara is passable but the calamari and shrimp were dry, rubbery, and bland.  Straight from freezer to cooker (and way too much cooking at that).  Chicken Diablo:  Swimming in oil, and not high-quality EVOO.  Just oil and chicken fat.  Pasta:  NOT homemade.  C'mon guys.  Where is Uncle Sal?  Halibut with lemon/caper over pasta:  Overcooked, dry fish.  Boxed, dried pasta.  Meh.  For $20?  RIght.  The House Salad?  Old lettuce with large chunks of grated cheese.  That's it.  Give me iceberg, shaved carrots, and bottled Hidden Valley any day.  (Snark?  What?  Moi?).  I also think too many reviews are skewed by what some consider to be bad service.  In this case, they were right:  The other review about service is NOT a gripe.  They lack organization and training.  Lots of running around but nothing accomplished.   It took almost 30 minutes and several please to get a drink order.  At the same time, other tables were getting VIP treatment, even from the older gentleman (Manager?  Uncle Sal?) running around \"running' things.  There were only 4 tables that night.  And at least 5 runners/servers/staff (not including bartenders, etc).  WTF?  Was it a racial issue?  Because we weren't regulars?  Couldn't say, but definitely noticed.  Sorry, Uncle Sal, I won't be back.  Unless the intervention works.  Call Gordon Ramsey or that other dude...I feel a Food Network episode germinating...",

Well ....we will now be regulars! First they bring you garlic bread that is delish!!  I had the NY steak and it was cooked perfect and my husband had a scallop dish over angel hair pasta that was very good. Oh ...and before your main course they bring you a house salad that is very good and nice portion. To top the meal off we had Tiramisu and I have to say it was the best I have ever had!!! Uncle Sal's has good food, friendly service, homey atmosphere, and reasonable prices....can't ask for much more!",

I like to eat in the bar area, but there is also plenty of space in the dining area.

Primarily the hope that the Cosby Show is rebooted but with the primary character being Theo this time around and he's an ex Iraqi war vet with PTSD or the hope Build A Bear gives its customers a better selection of stuffed animals to build. The other thing that gets me through the days...Uncle Sal's.   When I first went to lunch here I did not expect culinary nirvana. When I received my sausage and peppers lunch special that day though I received far more than that. Instead I was given a new outlook on my life. I felt awakened. Before that sausage and peppers dish my soul was dead inside. Now I wanted to live.   Their lunch specials are nothing short of incredible. Ground round, scallops, sausage and peppers, etc. I've asked myself while enjoying my lunch special pork chop that only costs $7 what is more incredible? This or the fact gamma rays made Bruce Banner into a green unstoppable monster? I thought for a moment then realized the obvious answer was the pork chop.   Not only is the food amazing so is the atmosphere. Upon opening the door you will feel like you have not only entered Rome but also a senior citizens home for aging Italians. Which is weird because this is the same exact feeling one would get when walking into my own apartment. Maybe that's never why I get second dates.   The wait staff is more awesome than Bane's army in Dark Knight Rises. They always know my order, what drink I always get which is either a Mello Yello spiked with Jager or a Capri Sun, and what my favorite Lionel Ritchie song is - Dancin on the Ceiling.   If Uncle Sal's had to reincarnate itself into a man it would be a combination of Brad Pitt, Bill Gates, John Stamos, and the Daili Lama. Now that's an impressive restaurant.",

I always eat in the bar area which has a special menu (along with the full menu) and is a completely different atmosphere compared to the restaurant area.  The bar area, which includes several 2-3 seat tables along with the bar and one large table, is cozy and usually is packed.  You feel like you're in an old Italian neighborhood establishment.   When it comes to the food- Everything is delicious- I've never had an average meal here.  The bread, salads, soup, meals, desserts, etc. are all superb. Eggplant rolatini or eggplant parm are outstanding!  The scallops are delicious and affordable. Everything is delicious- that sums it up.",

We had a reservation for the patio at 6 p.m.  It was already busy both inside and outside when we arrived at 5:45 p.m.  We sat on the end of the porch and after being seated I noticed a large fly trapped in the parmesan cheese container.  I handed it to the server and it was replaced.  I also had to hand the busser a irty bread and butter dish and two spoons.  We ordered and the salads arrived, but no pepper was offered to us so I had to get it myself from the nearby cart.  As we were awaiting our meal, I kept smelling cigarette smoke.  I look over and there are staff members taking a break near the porch.  The waitress was finished smoking, popped some mints into her mouth and off she goes back to her section at the other end of the porch.  Didn't wash her hands before returning.  Food violation??   If I saw the fly in the cheese jar and the dirty dishes, why didn't the person who set the table? The new management appears aloof and does not notice the deails.  If they are negligent on setting tables it makes you wonder where else they are negligent.",

Greeting was too long in coming and lacked any warmth when it did arrive.  Explanation for two different menus was never offered but we figured it out after hearing it explained to another couple (after we had ordered).  Food was ok but smaller portions and not 'authentic' Italian - a very American version.  Lastly, we noticed desserts on the menu but weren't even asked if we were interested in dessert.  One would think that was normal level of service from staff until you saw the interactions with some of the regulars.  If you're not a regular, save your time and go to Olive Garden - it will be a better experience and unfortunately, better food.",

I ordered some crab cakes as an appetizer which we delicious. My wife had the Penne Pesto. A rich dish with sliced potatoes and green beans with a pesto sauce that tied the dish together. I had the Veal Saltimbocca. The classic white wine sauce with   prosciutto, spinach, mushrooms & sage. The veal was tender and the sauce makes this dish a star. The other 2 people in our party had the familiar Veal and Chicken Parmigiana dishes. The marinara sauce was \"oh so good\". As you can tell Uncle Sal's has great food. My only pet peeve was the amount of time to get our food. We waited an hour for the main course. I know, Sat. night. Packed house.

    "text": "I stopped by here last night as part of a party of 6.  We had made reservations for Uncle Sals at 6 PM earlier in the day and arrived at 5 minutes past the hour to a ready table.  The inside of the restaurant is quite large with a huge bar up a few steps to the right and then a good amount of seating.  There is also some seating outside on the patio.  We ended up getting sat in a large circular booth near the back of the restaurant.  From what I could tell back there Uncle Sals reminded me of an old school Italian restaurant with lots of dark woods, dim lighting and pictures on the wall.  Our table decided to start off the evening by splitting the frito misto.  Since there were 6 of us it didn't go very far but I was able to have some calamari and shrimp.  While some of the calamari was good, others had a little more of a fishy taste than I liked.  It was the shrimp which was excellent though being fried to a perfect golden brown and tasting nice and sweet.  Then for my entree I ordered the chicken piccata which came with a starter of salad or soup for which I chose salad and a side of green beans.  Whenever it came to the table I saw it was maybe a single chicken breast covered in piccata sauce with a large helping of green beans on the side.  If I had been hungrier on this evening I probably would complain about the sizing but for me this was perfect.  The chicken was cooked nicely and the sauce was really quite good.  It had a somewhat thick consistency and the lemon and white wine brought the acidity while the capers brought the saltiness.  It was good enough that I ended up dipping my greens into the sauce after I had finished the chicken.  As for the green beans themselves, they were  just ok.  The reason that I say that is that they were cooked a little softer than the al dente that I like (it's a personal preference so I am not complaining.)  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I thought that the food was pretty good, especially my piccata sauce, and that it was fairly priced.",

We had a choice of soup or house salad and we both took the salad which was refreshing, but I only had 1 tomato and lots of shredded mazzorilla cheese on top. The Italian garlic bread was very good with a little bit of heat.

    "text": "I don't  get it. I kept hearing how good this place was so we went a couple weeks ago on a sunday evening around 6 pm. They were busy the place is small, our choice was wait, patio or bar area.  We decided to eat at the bar, although now I wish we had not.  The Bartender who became our waiter- was rude, and took a attitude when I asked if there were any house wines or specials in the bar. He immediately gave that look like- great cheap people.  We aren't -but we have a definite problem ordering without asking- Chianti's can range from $5 bucks to $8..a glass which is a joke considering you can buy a bottle of it for around 8 or 9. We went ahead and ordered but the waiter  was about as pleasant as well he wasn't.  Just a irritation of mine-but this is a business where people should be NICE. Always.  When he brought our our bread and salads he ran into the chair at the high we were at - the one my left leg was balanced on, and it hit my knee. I think he knew he did it- as it made a noise but he just ignored the look on my face-and kept walking away. As for the dinner it was really just okay. Chicken Parm- honestly I have had many better versions elsewhere.  And after telling the hostess about my concerns of the lack of attention and rudeness of the waiter... she replied I'm just the Hostess you can call the owner if you want.  Perfect- One overworked underpaid hostess, and one rude waiter =2 stars, no more.  Won't ever go there again ....simply not that good for the price. My husband agreed that it was just \"okay\" although we tipped the normal 20%  -He asked me if he should adjust the tip and leave less- I told him  since i had ab bump on my knee not to ask me- as i would be tempted not to leave a dang dime.  And that is not normal  We leave 18 to 20% almost always.",

The lighting was a little low but still manageable. The hot fresh garlic bread to the table was a nice touch as well!",

Nothing was offered. This is the 2nd time our order was prepared with errors and not the tasty food we were anticipating.  My girlfriends seven year old daughter with the rest of her school mates could do a better job of preparing a take out meal.  When my girlfriend called Sal's again to complain the man identifying himself as the manager hung up on her.   i just read previous reviews where there is a cockroach infestion?",

The service was terrific, with a knowledgeable Server,  but unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired. My salad was well dressed, although it could have had a few more ingredients (Romaine Lettuce and a single lonely cherry tomato) and my Shrimp Pasta had only three, relatively small forlorn shrimp atop some very nicely done Pasta, with an unremarkable sauce. VERY disappointing.",

Since that fateful first encounter, I have been enjoying lunch here every other month or so for over three years. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. The service in the bar (where I usually eat) is excellent... my cup is never less than half-full and the food comes out within 15-20 minutes of ordering.   What I've had here:  - Grilled Italian Sausage with Green & Red Bell Peppers (only available in the bar) - delicious! This is a lot of food for only $7.95.  - Chicken Marsala (entree) - one of my favorites! This is a full chicken breast in an abundance of Marsala with loads of tender mushrooms.  - Chicken Francese (sandwich and entree) - PERFECTION. This is my all time favorite at Uncle Sal's. Chicken breast with a white wine and lemon sauce.  - Chicken Parmigiana - Tasty.  - Eggplant Parmigiana (sandwich) - Yummy for those days when I don't want meat. Get this with the sweet potato fries!   I've also had one of their pizzas. Pretty good, but I've never ordered it again because they have so many other things that are better.   I highly recommend Uncle Sal's!   Side Note: To be fair, I took my husband here once and he wasn't blown away. There might be something wrong with him though... :)",

When I called for reservations they were already booked, so we tried our luck in the bar. Our perseverance paid off and we found a spot.  The bar area is great and they have a bar menu that offers great food at a fairly cheap price. I had the NY strip and added the gorgonzola sauce that they serve on the pricier filet in the dining room. It was fantastic, the steak was cooked perfectly and the gorgonzola sauce is creamy and has just a little bite from the gorgonzola cheese. Our table also split the frito misto appetizer, the shrimp and calamari were very fresh and cooked perfectly.I have never had a bad meal here, the cioppino should not be missed. The service in the bar was friendly and very attentive, they make a heck of an old fashioned as well.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch on a whim. It was small, quaint. A few tables of older (Italian) men and couples (ALWAYS a good sign at an Italian restaurant!). The decor was dated, but gave the feeling like I really was sitting down to dinner with an Italian family. I was surprised there was no lunch menu, just full priced dinner dishes. Our side salad (which at least was included with the meal) was nothing more than lettuce with dressing and 1 cherry tomato on the side. I covered my salad in pepper just for some type of taste.  However my main entree was delish. I ordered a Scallop & Shrimp Antoinette dish. The taste was unexpected. Every bite literally had a different taste because of the different ingredients and every bite was good. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicken Alfredo, that is until he tasted my dish and then \"his wasn't good anymore\" LOL. I tasted his & I personally felt it was bland and there was no taste to the chicken. But again, mine was great. Our service was good. My boyfriend actually loved it more than the few other Italian places Ive taken him too so we will be back Im sure",

    "text": "I am hoping we have another opportunity so I can decide if the poor service/bad attitude are par for the course or an anomaly. My friends and family were in the bar area and another couple and my husband and I sat at another bar table. While both of our husbands were either in the restroom or visiting the rest of our party in the bar, the waitress asked if it was just the two of us in this way:  \"Are there going to be four here? Because if it's just the two of you, I'm going to have to bump you.\" Nice. We assured her there were four of us. I inquired about Happy Hour and she quickly dismissed that, almost patronizingly, like why would I think there would be happy hour in the bar on an early Sunday evening. After that, and upon learning how the rest of our group in another area were treated by this same waitress, we decided to leave. The other people in our party left as well. My husband and I loved Uncle Sal's and appreciate its history and longevity in the Valley, but we were so disappointed after last night that I felt compelled to post this. Maybe the server was overwhelmed as it was crowded, but we were encouraged to contact someone at Uncle Sal's to inform them of our bad experience which I plan to do immediately.",

The sauces on our dishes were very tasty and plenty of it (a plus for me).  Their menu has plenty of choices for everyone including seafood, veal, chicken, and pasta selections.  It was hard to decide because they all sounded so good.    Then, just after we started eating one person in our party had a small cockroach crawl up the rim of his plate and into his food.  It then proceeded to crawl across the entire table as we all scrambled to get up.  As I was standing there backing away from the table, I looked down at an empty table behind me and there was another one!  A gentleman came out and killed the two that we saw, then the manager came over and apologized.  He offered for us to leave at no charge for the meal, or he would remake our meals and switch us to another table.  Our party was trying to decide what to do as we had not really eaten yet, but weren't sure if we wanted the food remade.  The manager said he would remake the food and take care of us, so we went to sit at our new table.  They were all very apologetic about it and said they had recently sprayed so that's probably why the roaches were out.  At the end of our meal the waiter offered to buy us a dessert, so we got a cannoli (also delicious).    Then they brought us the check... They charged us full price for everything (except the dessert the waiter offered).  I would have expected that they would have AT LEAST taken off the meal of the person who had the cockroach crawling in it (one of the cheaper pasta meals at that!) or even comp the appetizer, something to make up for cockroaches crawling on our food other than just re-cooking the meals.  The food would get 4-5 stars, but paying over $100 to dine with cockroaches crawling across your table is just unacceptable.",

I ordered fettuccine with shrimp and red sauce, the dish had an Italian name that I don't remember, and don't want to remember.  The fettuccine was actually good, but the sauce killed it. The sauce was way over seasoned. It made my eyes water because it was soo spicy. Very Hot! I really like spicy food, Thai, Mexican and Middle East, but this dish was way over the top. Now for the shrimp, simply disgusting. The shrimp was tough, rubbery and had an odd texture. Non edible. My thought is that Uncle Sal's use of spices had to do with the low quality shrimp. Also at Uncle Sals, they don't use computers or calculators. They told us it was up to us to figure out how much to pay. What a mess and soo embarrassing. Never again, ever. Life is to short to eat bad food.",

Many were just finishing dinner and filtering out, so we were able to get a nice roomy booth. BUT: our hostess didn't come across as how I described the feel of this place. Our table unfortunately; still seemed to be a little dirty with bread crumbs that were left behind and a used utensil . It was a place setting for 5 (we were a party of 3) so we just took the clean items from the other dinner set(s). Our server was David. He greeted us nicely and told us of two seafood specials they were offering for the evening. He brought us ice cold waters & took are bar drink orders. As he was walking away he made mention that bread should be arriving. This was also directed to the servers assistant; but we didn't receive our bread for a good 20 minutes or so, it came out \" just before our food arrive\".. Our girl (13) has the Caesar salad: it was average & she also had the Mussels AND clams which she thoroughly enjoyed. She ate the entire appetizer & soaked up that seafood, garlicky wine broth with toasty garlic bread..  My husband had the Veal Parmigiana with melted mozzarella & their spicy marinara sauce. This was a great dish. It was accompanied with pasta ( underneath) & some really delicious green beans!  I started with a dinner salad with blue cheese dressing. I didn't enjoy this \"at all\" ? In Fact, I ended up giving it to my husband. It was the dark romaine tops ; chopped and piled high on the plate with a standard blue cheese dressing, no croutons, lots of shredded mozzarella & one tiny cherry tomato. My main course: I had the Spaghetti ( instead of Penne) Pasta Alla Vodka, amazing creamy tomato sauce with a bright punch of flavor.  Added with that- some fresh julienned basil on top! Perfect!! Started off a little rocky, but got back on track with the main courses.  David was very pleasant and engaged with us during our dinning experience, we will give him a \"pass\" for the delayed bread issue! LOL From our conversation with our server, the owners have a few other locations in the Scottsdale area. The Side Door, The Blind Pig and a Mexican Restaurant very near to here called : Carlsbad. We plan to try them all..",

The crab cakes were large with mostly meat. My pasta dish was good. The service was very slow because they were busy. I wish they would have brought out the bread basket sooner since I was starving. It took 20 minutes to get any bread.",

The food was great as usual.  We wife told the manager the place ran like a well oiled machine . She thanked us. She must have told the staff because some thanked us .

    "text": "I will start this off by saying that I do not like pasta.   My mom and dad were in town for the holidays and my mom, however, was craving some spaghetti and meatballs. To my dismay I literally knew of no Italian places to take them because I never eat it. I also refuse to eat at chains so Olive Garden was a big NO in my book.   I stumbled upon Uncle Sals from Yelp and it quickly gained the spot in my mom and dad's heart as their favorite restaurant in Arizona. My dad had ordered the supreme pizza, my mom the sausage and spaghetti and myself the chicken picatta. We all loved our meals.   We sat outside on the patio despite it being quite chilly because they were in town from Indiana and they thought it was too cool to eat outside in December. The patio had dim lighting and nice heaters that made it a really nice family dinner.   The bread was delicious as we waited for our food and the stuffed mushrooms were to die for. I seriously have no idea what were in them but I couldn't stop eating them with the bread.   Our server was the best part of our dinner. I wish I could remember her name; she had blond hair and was maybe in her early 30s.  She was by far the best server I've ever had; more than attentive, friendly and just a nice person. She was happy to assist my mom who can be picky and was always there when we needed her, especially when we were the only ones on the patio.   Definitely check this place out, even if you don't like Italian. The portions are huge and it is an incredibly reasonable price compared to chains like Olive Garden. Better quality, better ambiance same price.",

Bussers took plates before we were finished, coffee was never refilled, server was running around like a chicken with her head cut off with my credit card for at least 15 minutes, had to ask both Bussers and hostess for help. Can't help to think service was poor due to the 19% auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more. I'm a 20%+ tipper usually, would have left more if service was good+. Bummer of an experience. We're very low maintenance, having restaurant businesses in the family. Not impressed.",

For an appetizer we had the Frito Misto which was calamari and shrimp delicately fried and served with marinara.   I asked a family member for a recommendation for dinner.  His response to coin a phrase from a certain movie was \" Try the Veal, it is the best in the city\". So I had the Veal Francese,  I was not disappointed.  The wife had the Chicken Fiorintina which was chicken sauteed in a white wine lemon sauce topped with cheese and spinach served over pasta. We actually had this for lunch today and was still delicious.   The service was excellent. They did not try to rush us so we were all able to enjoy our meals and be with family.   # 250 & counting. Of course it is about an Italian Restaurant. :)",

Initially the service wasn't bad as we got there early, around 5PM. He immediately got us our wine and everything went well. Then he asked us if we wanted to place our orders, and we told to give us a few minutes as we were still settling down and haven't had the chance to peruse the menu yet. After 20 MINUTES waiting, I practically had to throw myself into his eye line to flag him down.  Then, he snarkily replied, \"Oh, are you ready to order now?\" Well yeah, you freaking ding dong! So, that was already the first red flag. Our meal finally arrives, and the food was good. THEN in the middle of our meal, the staff kept coming to our table asked if they can pack up our meals. DUDE, WTF?? That happened a few times, so strike number two. Then the waiter came up to us and asked about desert, and there was one person at our table still working on their meal. So, out of frustration, we said no and he took offense to that, and ran to the owner to complain. The next part shocked me as the owner took his side, and didn't even bother to do anything to make the situation better. After that he didn't even bother coming back to our table to check up on us, unless we flag him down. It's very disappointing because the food is actually good. Literally the worst experience ever, and from what I can tell there are quite a few peeps with similar experiences. You would think they'd change...",

    "text": "I was dismayed, and heartbroken that this Yelp reviewed establishment was not cracked up to be. I'm saddened that in comparison to the Italian Grotto in old town's main drag this place fails miserably. *tear*  Went out to dinner with friends Sara V. and Lauren D., we were looking forward to enjoying some good ol' Italian goodness, just like our experience last Friday at the Grotto, this experience was sorely disappointing.   Our server was plain bad, she lied or she was lacking the know how and didn't take the time to find out. What am I talking about? Well it's Fridays and it's Lent so for Catholics, it's a day to abstain from red meat. Seafood and veg can be eaten. So when she took our orders, the ladies went for the house salad, while I chose the soup of the day which was seafood gumbo. I had asked if there was meat in the seafood gumbo in which our server rattled off without making sure, that there was no meat in the gumbo and it was all seafood. So if you've eaten gumbo, altho it may have seafood there's usually some andouille sausage. So I believed her. Salads and soup came, and lo and behold, what was in the soup? seafood yes. yuckiness yes. and drum roll pls.... a meatball. last time i checked that's meat not seafood... so the soup was a fail, and the server failed. The ladies were telling me to start a ruckus but I made the decision to myself that there would be no next time with this place.  We ordered their Frito Misto for an appetizer a mix of calamari and three shrimp. Notice the discrepancy here, 3 small breaded shrimp and a plate of calamari... with non-flavorful marinara. two stars.  seafood gumbo. zero stars.  I ordered the Pesce Alla Vodka, it was shrimp and calamari in a vodka cream sauce. three shrimp, and three scallops. it wasn't jumbo shrimp but that's ok. it was alright nothing wow. nothing that i would forget about the soup incident, silently forgive the messup and come back... no it was meh. so two stars.  unlimited garlic bread... ok. three stars.  and tiramisu for dessert... ok... let's state my favorite places for tiramisu are the Parlor and the Grotto... both are ridiculously orgasmic this one... heavy on the powder on top and lady fingers were kinda dry... if those two place are orgasmic ummm this one is more like satisfying but not good. so two and half stars.  Overall dining experience, one and a half, had to round up to two. not impressed.... seriously disappointed and for all of you who haven't been here, there's seriously better places, totally not worth it.",

    "text": "I was just there this past Saturday night on a first date. She suggested Uncle Sal's and I had never heard of it before and was game for a great Italian restaurant. Being new to the area, I look forward to getting to know as many places as possible. Although the restaurant is in a strip mall, Uncle Sal's sits back off the road a little which is good because you don't get a lot of car noise if you're sitting on the patio. There are fountains outside with dim lights for a very casual dining experience. When my date arrived, we walked in and were greeted by a very nice hostess. I told her we had reservations for the patio and I asked her if smoking was allowed there and she said yes. So we opted for the bar which was open seating. The bar area is filled with tables along the wall and a horse shoe bar. We were greeted immediately by Johnny, a NY yankee fan whose service was impeccable. He was fast, courteous, and had a lot of personality.   The menu was filled with every type of Italian dish you could hope for. Although I was looking for some pasta, I tried the filet mignon with gorganzola sauce. Johnnie brought out lightly toasted garlic bread with either olive oil or butter on it. I don't remember but it was gooooood. The salads came fast and were very good.   My date ordered pasta with sausage and peppers and there was enough food to feed two people. My dinner came out and I was surprised with the portion as well. It was almost the length of a NY Strip, but thick like a filet. And folks....it was one of the best filets I've had in a long time. I usually order my meat medium and this melted in my mouth it was so tender. I also had it on a bed of bowtie pasta. The only thing that I would have liked differently, was that there was too much sauce and it was poured on my steak. It took a little away from the flavor of steak but it was to die for. It was that good!   Great service, great food, nice ambiance for a small place. I'll be back soon to try their pizzas and pasta dishes!",

The brushetta appertizer is excellent with fresh tomatoes and needs to be shared.  The chicken marsala at lunch is adequate but needs sharing at dinner.  If shared each gets the salad or soup plus a side pasta dish with a single chicken breast with mushrooms, pasta and marsala sauce.  The wine selection is good plus the glass is filled more than at other restaurants.  By the time one finishes desert is nearly out of the question but you do get a cookie.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.",

Sometimes, they are friendly, other times they just drop you water, take your order and never see them again until you wave them down to get your bill. I always get the chicken focatta which is amazing. The mix of capers, lemon and artichoke hearts. YUMMMM. But i would not going there for dinner, way over priced. Best bet is to do lunch which is basically the same menu and portions but half the price. If you go there just for the food, it's great.",

It is a quaint little authentic Italian place hidden in a strip mall. We are both bartenders, so we gravitated towards the bar. We were immediately entertained by Johnny and Mary Ann. They were attentive, fun and great at what they do. The drinks were made right (and my wife is very picky about her dirty Martini's) and the wine kept flowing for me. The food was delicious and very affordable. We have made this our date night spot and stop in as much as possible. In the 3 years we have been coming here, we have yet to have a bad experience or a bad meal. Make sure you get there earlier, since they close at 9pm most nights. The crowd is a great mix of older locals and younger people who are just discovering this spot. It is great for a quick meal or a date night. We love this place!",

Meals all come with garlic bread (unlimited) and a salad or soup included.   The salad is a very large portion with real Parmesan cheese shavings on top. Delicious.   All chicken dishes are $17. All veal dishes are $24. Everything we've ordered or our friends have ordered has always been fresh, hot, well prepared and beyond delicious.   The owners are from the East Coast and really know how to prepare Italian food.   Absolute winner in Phoenix, our \"go to\" Italian restaurant and one of the few places we take guests and friends for dinner.",

My wife and I wanted to take my younger sister, who is visiting Phoenix for the weekend on summer break, to a nice dinner. We decided to come here because of the great Yelp Reviews and photos.   My wife and I already knew what we wanted to order because we were drooling over the yelp photos prior to coming. When our server, Jennifer (middle aged blonde woman), came to take our order my younger sister asked her to start with me because she was still indecisive about what she wanted. We were all taken back when Jennifer said, \"No I'm going to start with you first.\" My sweet sister, feeling frazzled, ordered something out of pressure because she didn't want to make us wait.   My wife then ordered the Pesce Alla Vodka and asked to sub spinach instead of pasta. Jennifer gave her an annoyed look, but begrudgingly agreed to the substitution.   10 minutes later, when we thought our orders were being prepared, our server came out and told my wife she will only substitute the pasta for spinach with an up-charge of $7.00. $7?! Are you out of your mind? It felt like a passive aggressive \"fuck you\". So my wife politely declined and cancelled her order sticking with the salad she ordered as a starter dish. To make the uncomfortable situation even more uncomfortable Jennifer then said, \"okay that's fine, but now it's gonna take longer for everyones food to come out\". As if she was trying to punish my wife for canceling her order after refusing to pay $7 for spinach.   We continued to receive a snarky attitude from Jennifer throughout our whole dining experience and could not wait to leave! Needless to say we will not return. And we will not recommend this place to our family and friends.",

Next our entree salads arrived, the salad was nicely sized as well and the Italian dressing was great. The entrees arrived shortly after we had finished our salads. They were both delicious and tender.   The only disappointment of the evening was dessert and that is only because they were out of the tiramisu  ( which is what I really wanted) but I save myself some calories ...

They do it hiding behind the cash register. They forget - some people watch what bottles are used to make a drink. My bartender was caught before, and again tonight.   If I ask for grey goose - I expect grey goose! Same goes for wine! If I want Meiomi, don't give me Banfi or some cheap Italian version.  The last time (3+ months ago) I was at Uncle Sal's I learned my bartender substituted my wine request with an inferior brand. They didn't tell me and it tasted like shit. So I sent it back and asked for a new bottle to be opened and poured in front of me. Toni's excuse - they didn't have an open bottle when I ordered it. Keep an eye on your drinks being made. I've seen it happen with other patrons who are too drunk to notice or not observant to care  Would have liked to stay - but with ignorance and substitutions - not worth my time.",

On a very busy Saturday night Sal's got a great table on the patio.  Our martinis were shaken and delivered with blue cheese stuffed olives. Memories of the perfect Ketel One martinis served at the Paul R Pub in Austin danced in my head as we toasted and sipped.   We started with their baked clams and plus one who would never ever think about eating a clam loved them. My Caesar salad arrive with extra anchovies as requested, perfecto! Our pasta entrees were cooked to perfection, el dente. Loved the gravy. As a nit the cannoli desert was OK not great, but it did not take away from our wonderful dining experience.

    "text": "I so wanted to like this restaurant as we've heard about it for years.  We finally made it there for lunch on May 17, 2019.  While my wife enjoyed her tortellini dish, my chicken piccata was a major disappointment.  This is one of my favorite dishes and I often order it at a new Italian restaurant to get a sense of their selections.  \"Piccata\" itself means thin slices of meat, dusted with flour, sauteed in oil/butter, then served over pasta with a lemon/white wine sauce and capers.  I make it home often, too.  Uncle Sal's dish is a chicken breast, not pounded thin, and apparently boiled, because it had no color indicating browning in oil/butter.  The sauce was the consistency and taste of Campbell's cream of chicken soup with lemon juice added.  A few capers were tossed on to the plate.  I've never had a piccata that was not thinly sliced meat or that was not browned in butter/oil.  How this is Italian is beyond me. One of our guests has severe dietary restrictions and when she asked for scallops to be cooked a certain way (just seared in olive oil, no pasta or sauce, but grean beans on the side) our server gave her a hard time, stating that he'll ask the cook if he can prepare the scallops that way and no guarantee and she'd have to take what the chef sent out - No Returns!!!  That's good customer service. She did get the scallops the way she wanted but the server seemed sullen for the rest of the meal and returned only once to see how we were doing. Our other guest ordered eggplant parmigiano and it arrived looking more like lasagne, but he said it was good. Lunch for 4 at lunch was $85, with no alcohol and before tip. If you're looking for authentic Italian cuisine, I think you can do better than Uncle Sal's.  Its not on our return list.",

    "text": "We are in town for a conference & drove about 20 minutes out of our area to search this place out because of all the great reviews. We make it a point to seek out family owned restaurants and avoid chains whenever possible. The dinner menu had an excellent selection so everyone got to order something different. The flavor of the food was fantastic. The portion size left a lot to be desired, the side salad is maybe a handful of lettuce served with one cherry tomato & shredded cheese. Considering how inexpensive pasta is I find Italian restaurants in general seem to overcharge, but their saving grace is usually that the portion sizes are usually family style or simple very healthy in size. I ordered the chicken piccata (which as I said was delicious) but it literally had about 4 bites of spaghetti with it. My husband asked for a side of spaghetti which was again about a handful & we were charged $5.00 over & about the $17.00 for the meal in the first place. The bus guy literally seemed to be hounding us for our plates, if anyone took a moment to pause & visit during the course of our meal he's come over & ask if he could take the plate. It was not relaxing. The waitress was nice enough, but scarce & seemed irritated that we asked for the spaghetti then never came back once she placed the check, which she kind of slid onto the table in passing as if she didn't have the time to stop in an almost empty dining room. Ultimately, the three stars are for the flavor of the food.",

You wouldn't think much of it from the outside (nestled into a strip mall anchored by an Office Depot with patio views of a Carl's Jr), but the inside makes you forget you're in a suburban strip mall and the ambiance, service, and food are excellent.  My server was great.  Five stars all the way.  I let her choose what I was eating (after eliminating a few items I wasn't interested in) and she brought me an order of chicken parmesan.  It was great.  No complaints whatsoever.    My glass of the house cab wasn't spectacular but, whatever.  That's on me (kind of).  Unless I missed something, they have a fine selection of wine by the bottle but the selection of individual glasses was very limited.  Overall, my experience at Uncle Sal's was enjoyable and it is a place I'll be back to.",

The linguine with clams is nothing short of amazing.  The sauce is light and not overpowering.  I got the white sauce.  The only way clams should be served in my humble opinion.    Caprese salad.  Let's just back up a second and talk about the components. What makes a good caprese?  I'll tell you what.  The balsamic vinegar.  I could bathe in that sweet syrupy delight of what most Americans will never know unless they go abroad to Italy and do a tasting or they happen to work in the restaurant industry.  Absolutely incredible.  The cheese was and is incredible.  There is a creaminess to this mozzarella that possess just the right hint of salt.  No pucker like you find in some rushed mozzarellas.  My only suggestion would be heartier tomatoes.  As this is the season for good Romas and beefsteaks.  I will be back.  And I'm coming for the veal.  Be warned and thank you.  I'm shaking my head with a tear in my eye.",

On the positive side, the service is great, the bread and salad are still very good, and they have some reasonably priced glasses of wine. Unfortunately, these positives can not overcome the disappointing, mediocre food.",

Let me explain, there is the restaurant part - great atmosphere, dimmed lights, with conversations as the background noise. There is also the bar area, which has a limited menu, all which is excellent. With TV's and high top tables. Lastly, \"The Side Door.\" It is connected only through the kitchen and is almost a sub-restaurant to Sal's. Same menu but again, a different atmosphere.   As far as food goes, we get the stuffed mushrooms every time. UNBELIEVABLE with the garlic bread. Must have - I don't even like mushrooms. The bianco pizza is fantastic. It is a white pizza which my gf is addicted too.  If I would give it another star, the service would have to be better. Not saying the people aren't nice, but you really have to plan on being there for an hour or more. I might be a really picky person though.   I would recommend to anyone who appreciates italian food.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nate.phxestates.com&s=aa46f1d80871e3a83a1c244117cbb68203f3955e0e7172f901f115ce405dfa61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nate.phxestates.com</a>",

I had the spicy shrimp and my date had the chicken parm.  We had salads to start... Scott came by to take our plates and I was not completely finished with my salad.  He informed us our entrees were ready to be served.  Interesting so this salad must be taken?  I thought.  As he was so hastily ready to whisk away our salads, I realized he had taken away my knife with.  I asked, \"excuse me when you have a chance, may I please get a fresh knife?\"  He proceeded to bring back my half eaten salad and placed the plate in front of my face as if to say here, you can have this one.    As we were nearly half way through our main dishes he had asked if either of us would want desert?  Now both my date and I are staring at each other and thinking, ok are we wasting this guys time or what?  We felt so rushed, so hurried to get out of there and just treated rudely.  My date, being the kind man he is said, you know what place a desert menu down and we will take a look at it when we are DONE with our entrees.    Entree dishes are taken, and do not get me wrong the food was delicious!  We are still finishing our wine and enjoying conversation... Scott had to have been back and forth at least 3 different times asking if we had made a decision.  At this point it is almost frustrating we just placed an order so this fellow would 1) leave us alone and 2) stop us feel as though we were wasting his time.   If you go here, I strongly encourage not sitting in Scott's section.  Great food but HORRIBLE service.",

Sat for 10 or 15 minutes after getting water And bread before server stopped by. Had to ask for her to come to the table.   After ordering drinks.....she said she would tell us about the specials.....but didn't come back for another 10 minutes (or more). Never told us the specials. Checked on us once after taking our order. Sat for quite a long time before coming to see if we wanted dessert. But of course they were out of tiramisu and cannoles.  She explained quite often over half of the deserts are reserved at the same time the reservations are made. If you know this....why not make more to begin with?   We are from out of town....so won't likely get to experience the location again. With all the food options in town...I will likely not think about returning next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Kyle's appetizer salad was admittedly pathetic-looking, as it was literally pieces of lettuce with shredded cheese on top.     3. Cannelloni entree was almost good. It's chicken, veal, and spinach pureed together and wrapped in a crepe. Crepe and covering white sauce were great... But the filling wasn't doing it for me flavor or texture-wise (maybe I don't like cannelloni's?? It was my first one! Is anyone else bothered by veal and chicken being shoved in a blender together and pureed???)  4. The chocolate bonet dessert with pistachio biscotti is a MUST. The bonet is this decadent, silky, gorgeous cross between a fudge and a pudding, topped with house-made whipped cream. I could tell they put Reddi-whip on top of the housemade cream though, which, to me, may have cheapened an otherwise excellent dessert. Just excellent.",

Ordered stuffed mushrooms  they came swimming in some sort of Alfredo  cheese sauce,  we expressed our dislike of the mushrooms and our server looked at us as though  something was wrong  with us! Instead of offering to remake  them to our liking or offering to bring us something different she just took them away. Main course was deep fried veal steak again smothered in tomato  sauce on a bed of spaghetti noodles not very appetizing. The server asked if I was done 5 min after I received  my food!  My mother had ravioli which she found  not to her liking.  I guess the one bright spot was desert, we had creme brule. And coffee it was pretty  good, but not enough to make up for an over all poor experience,  A waste of $68 , the server was lucky I left her $5  Do yourself a favor  and look for Italian  food elsewhere.

It's like being at your friend's house whose family is happy to see you for a holiday or something.   Because of this they have a very loyal following. It's not an uptight militant 5 star restaurant type attitude, but more like a light hearted they're happy to be here there and happy you could come kind of a thing.   The atmosphere is very lady and the tramp. Hard to capture in a photograph but with the music, the soft lights, and the crowd it's a cozy little spot. I've brought lovers, friends, and family members here to see this place. The place has a lot of class.   The food is reflective of East Coast Americanized fine Italian dining. Wherever you've been in the US or Canada this will absolutely rank among the best Italian food you've ever consumed. I've taken a lot of people here and afterwards everyone's always remarked that it was one of the best meals they've ever eaten.   I'd recommend something but it's phenomenal so it just depends on what you're in the mood for.    For $$ out of $$$$ it's underpriced if anything.   With that in mind please be respectful when you go there. Be mindful of your audience and please don't dress like a hobo... Suits, dresses, slacks, nice sweaters, nice shoes, leave your ball cap in the car and flip flops at home!",

The $12 chicken parmesan was excellent served with pasta. It was a huge cutlet with top quality marinara sauce and very filling. The garlic bread that was served in individual pieces was hot and perfect. The salads have also improved with more lettuce, a tomato and some cheese as well. Both ranch and blue cheese dressings were solid.    The fettuccine alfredo was the big miss. The noodles used were wrong and the alfredo sauce was poorly executed. This was not a good version, so stick to the red sauce stuff and things should be fine.",

It was my first time at this restaurant n I can say it is by far the BEST Italian I have eaten!!! The bday girl who is Italian recommended this place so...  We started off w several bottles of the house red blend n surprisingly for $26 a bottle, it was absolutely delicious!!!  The garlic bread was amazing. I never eat bread but tonight I ate three pieces!! I got the Gorgonzola mushroom as an appetizer. My god!! It melted in my mouth!! So much flavor!!  I got the lobster ravioli w a choice of soup or salad n I picked the soup which was cream of spinach. The soup was a perfect texture and absolutely delicious n I am not even a fan of cream of anything. The lobster ravioli came w baby shrimp!! To die for seriously!! Another friend at the table ordered this and agreed. I wish it was a bigger portion cuz I wanted to eat more of it!!! Haha! The best lobster ravioli by far. My husband got the veal Marsala. I had a bite n it was very tasty. My other gf got the chicken parmigiana n told me several times that this can't be chicken! It was so tender, juicy but at the same time w a slight crunch. It was the perfect combination of flavors in my mouth.   The only down side is that they don't do split tabs so if ur going w a large group, be sure to bring cash.   Other than this, n one of the busser guys giving us dirty looks (yes it was our fault... we stayed an hour past closing but they made the reservations for 830pm which was 30 min b4 they closed)...I will definitely come back here to try the short ribs and some other dishes that looked super appetizing~  Highly recommend this place if you want amazing Italian food!",

    "text": "So we weren't originally going to go here, but as we walked by we noticed how busy Uncle Sals was and had to give it a try. Needless to say we found out what all the fuss was about. The atmosphere is candle lit with a bunch of round tables and an enclosed patio. We choose a high top in the bar (last one left) to avoid the 10 minute wait. We were wondering how fast service would be since they were so busy but our waitress didn't miss a beat. We were immediately greeted. Starting with the wine- I wasn't mad at the generous pours and the house cab got the job done. We started with side Caesar salads- the dressing was amazing, and homemade crotons for the win. Also! The complimentary bread they bring, is delicious garlic bread, is this heaven? My husband got the special pizza which was good but we were regretting not getting pasta. I had the breaded cod with sweet potato fries and loved it. We cannot wait to go back and try the pasta there.",

I was really disappointed because everybody that I talked to spoke very highly of this restaurant ..",

    "text": "So I am from Chicago and have been looking for a cozy, neighborhood Italian restaurant to hold up to my expectations for almost 18 months now. Sal's did just that. My party and I arrived fifteen minutes before our scheduled reservation and we were promptly seated without hesitation. Killed the first impression.  Upon being seated, you are immediately drawn in by the comfortable decor and dining area. The best part? There is a wall which separates the bar from the dining room. How great is that? I have heard they have an amazing happy hour menu from many friends so I will be back to try that in the near future.  From start to finish, the meal and service were both very enjoyable. The waitress was not \"too present\" but we always had everything we needed. She gave great secondary service. The only thing I think that was subpar was the prebussing of our table. We had plates from previous courses sit for awhile as well as our entree plates taking awhile to be cleared.  The food was very delectable from out salmon bruschetta to the three entrees that were ordered- lobster ravioli (great flavor and just the right portion), shrimp and scallop Antoinette (just the right ratio of pasta/vegetables/seafood), and the rack of lamb (cooked to a perfect medium temperature). We also had potato pesto soup which was just thick and creamy enough to leave you wanting one more spoonful! All in all, the dining experience was a pleasant one and I would completely recommend Sal's to anyone looking for that special neighborhood Italian restaurant without all the extra pretentious fluff some Scottsdale establishments have. Enjoy!",

Service was excellent. I started with the house Chianti and a Caesar salad- it was fresh and enormous and it comes with a generous portion of garlic bread. But I came specially for the veal which is always hit or miss. I ordered the veal Marsala and it was a hit. Tender, not salty, slightly sweet from the Marsala. Nicely done green beans and a bit of pasta. Amazing. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "The food is good here and I liked the place until the hostess just about threw us out last night because she said we had been at the table \"to long\".  I otherwise would have given it a much better review.  I met my friend visiting from Florida at this restaurant at 4:30pm last night and we did stay till 6:15 - an hour and 45 minutes.  We had not seen each other in person in over 2 years so we had a lot to catch up on.  Our bill was $50 and we left a $10 tip.  Both of us are executives for medical device companies and not bad or unruly customers.  But the hostess came over after they put the bill down and said \"you will have to pay and leave right now because we have someone for this table\".  She said we could go to the (very crowed bar) and have some drinks and finish our conversation.  She did not offer to buy us a drink as she was basically throwing us out for taking too long to eat and talk.  Both my friend and I said we have never been treated like this in a restaurant - EVER - and we both travel extensively for a living. I realize an hour and 45 minutes is a longer dinner but I remember my waitress days in college and you always allow people to finish their meal, conversations and decide when to leave.  We also noticed no one was waiting for a table other than two women as we left and found out that those two women were \"regulars\" that always sat at our table so we had to go.   I'd not go back as I feel they were rude and do not respect customers.  We have many other excellent Italian restaurants in town where you don't have to rush through dinner so they can turn a table for better customers.  This is just bad customer service and not the message you want out for business......I'm very, very disappointed.",

That said, I CANNOT understand how there are any negative reviews about the food, the staff or the atmosphere at Uncle Sals!  I have been here more times than I care to admit and I have NEVER walked out feeling anything other than very satisfied and impressed.  True classic Italian food! Everything is EXCELLENT...from the Lobster Ravioli to the Braised Beef...from the pizza's to the fresh fish with picata sauce (flown in daily)...from the crab cakes to the smoked salmon bruschetta...and of course tons of amazing classic pasta dishes - you will NOT be disappointed.  Only thing that doesn't \"wow\" me is their ceasar salad so I always opt for the soup...which is almost always wonderful (regardless of which one I get).  The tiramisu is absolutely heavenly!!!  The staff has never been anything other than professional and courteous. Most of their staff has been there for multiple years which is usually a very good sign for a restaurant. The atmosphere is a throwback to the classic East Coast, family owned Italian joint. The bar area has a seperate menu (smaller portions and smaller price tags) - good luck getting a seat in there lol  The place is almost always packed so call ahead for reservations.  Trust and believe, these folks know what they're doing.  Side note - the outside sitting area is EXCELLENT. If you choose to sit outside during mosquito season, you'll get bitten accordingly lol That goes for almost anywhere in AZ...not just Uncle Sals.  GO AND ENJOY!",

It was a Sunday, and they still had happy hour rocking at the bar.  We pulled up a chair, had great conversation with the other patrons and then the food came...  I lived in Seattle for seven years - so to impress me with seafood in Arizona is few and far between.  That said, the scallops here may have been the best I've ever had.  We also got the wings, which were solid, as well as a couple other appetizers that I can't remember, but did not disappoint.  The service was awesome, and come to find out they share a kitchen with another joint in the same plaza.  Any time this happens I'm kind of impressed - especially when the speed of food coming out is exactly as expected.  I'll certainly be back, and look forward to hearing more stories about the origin story... I'm a sucker for tales of Italian fellas in witness protection!",

Their staff is extremely friendly and nice...but mostly only to the patrons that are dining in. That makes perfect sense, as their service correlates to their tips. But still, I always  feel ignored when I'm there to pick up my food to-go.   The food is really good, but they recently surged their lunch menu prices so they no longer have great lunch specials. I'm also sick of feeling unwanted when I go pick up my lunch",

We arrive a little early, hostess is on the phone FOREVER, finally acknowledges us , we r seated and the food server, DAVID, ask if we would like to order drinks, we ask for 2 separate checks and he says, no they do not do separate checks, which is ok but I got the vibe he was lying. One of the 2 friends we were dining with ordered the special, sol w/ pasta. He ended up not liking it but did not say anything until the bill came. He thought it was $22.00 not 32.00. We could not find our food server , we asked another food server if they could get David to our table so that we could discuss the amount, when he finally shows ups he asks, \"so you don't like the dish because it costs $32.00\"? My friend was going to pay even though he wasn't happy with his dinner, he was frustrated because he was told the price was something different than what was in the bill. David could give 2 shits. I am sure he thought we were snow birds and that would be that. WRONG. The whole attitude of this restaurant is \"Oh well , we do not care, we have the reputation of being a great Italian restaurant , so whatever \".  There food is not that great. If you are not a regular, watch out. Never going there again! So rude!!!! Might I recommend Pasta Brioni.",

I realized there were many \"regulars\" there as patrons knew others names from across the bar, as well as patrons knew the bartenders names without introduction.  I thought that as my glass was empty, the bartender(s) would ask if I would like another.  That never happened.  After waiting over 15-minutes for them to notice my empty glass, I pushed my empty glass up to the bartender.  Another 15-minutes later, I had to ask for another glass of wine.  I also had to ask for a glass if water!  When my food arrived, my green beans were cold.  My chicken was hot.  Not once was I asked how my meal was.  You only get one chance at a first impression - Uncle Sal's failed miserably.  There's too many placed in Scottsdale to nosh.  I won't be back at Uncle Sal's.",

I also got a caesar salad, which came with my meal.  The salad had Parmesan cheese out of a shaker and turned me off right there. What kind of Italian place doesn't have freshly shaven Parmesan! My co worker got a meatball to try also and the sauce with it was decent, but the meat itself lacked flavor. For our main courses I got the lasagna and was happy with it. Good flavor and plenty to eat! He got the shrimp scampi and said it also tasted good. The waitstaff did a great job the entire time we were there also. Will I travel home wishing I could come back here. No. But will I come here again if I'm in Scottsdale craving Italian, yep.",

One example is their Chicken Saltimbocca($21.00).  The pasta served with it was way over cooked (almost mush), while the slices of prosciutto on the chicken were either thin, or thick and chewy.  The sauce, as others have noted is amazing.   Another example is their Chicken Parmigiana($18.00), which someone must of thought needed a cup of bitter marinara sauce on top (photo). We needed to scrap it off, just to get at the chicken. And yes, it came to a cup.   I could go on, but why..  Expect to pay $95, including taxes but before gratuities for three.

Though located in a typical Arizona strip mall, walking in is like wandering into your Italian uncle's living room (or I would presume as I, sadly, don't have an Italian uncle). The best part about this uncle is that he makes some amazing dishes.  Having been a few times and snacked off companions' plates, I would recommend the veal and chicken dishes above everything else. I haven't had one that hasn't wowed, while the pasta and pizzas are just fine.  The thing about the place being crowded is that the wait staff gets overwhelmed. It can be hard to order anything after the food order is placed--if you want more wine, you might be out of luck. But I keep going back because it's that good!",

I loved this restaurant so much after eating there for lunch in 2004 that I had to move close by.  From the Bar Menu  The pork chops, steak, ground round with a veggie (green beans-sauteed in olive oil) the way I make them are great choices.  From the lunch and dinner menu's pork chop marsala, veal milanese.   Drinks, house wine variety, and the best Long Island Iced Teas!  Buon Appetito",

The penne pasta dish was subpar. I couldn't understand how others would say how great their pasta dishes are when it was a heap of penne pasta with baked melted cheese on top. I could easily do this at home with jarred sauce and that would have been better. Seriously, save your money. Also, the drinks made there, were gawd awful.",

    "text": "What a shame!!!  My girlfriend and I really kinda liked this place.  The bar reminded me of lounges back home and the food was good and well priced.  So we brought my good friend along last night so that he could enjoy it too.  We'd talked about taking him here for awhile and seeing as we'd just watched our beloved Cubbies make it to the series it seemed like a nice atmosphere for dinner.  Problem is...my friend is 95% blind.  Last year we went to Guide Dogs of the Desert in Palm Springs after a many year wait to get his trained service dog Nike.  Nike had undergone about 30 months of training to be a guide dog and has accompanied my friend nightly for the past 18 months to many many restaurants and other establishments.  Until Uncle Sals last night.  We were swiftly told that Nike was not welcome in the large round bar area.  Naturally we presumed that this employee was not aware of the Americans with Disabilities Act and didn't realize that service animals and their owners cannot be discriminated against.    We hadn't come to Uncle Sals to sit outside or elsewhere.  We wanted to enjoy the lounge and order dinner there.  But the bartender was quick to acknowledge this \"rule\" and wouldn't serve us despite our insistance that this was not appropriate.  We were so shocked.  And when they out and out refused service, my blind friend called the police who arrived shortly thereafter.  And they were amazing.  Long and short is that the restaurant has the right to refuse service for any reason in Arizona.  It could be because you're black or gay or have long hair or maybe because you're straight.  Any reason at all.  And they were choosing to refuse us service at their bar area under the guise that it was because of this well behaved and trained service animal.   A dog who had the harness on and was working.  An English Black Lab who guided my friend in and then laid by his side as he is trained to do without making a peep.  A well trained working service animal who was on the job.  Working harder than the guys behind the bar or the hostess at the door.  Shame on you guys.  I've spent good money there in the past and have told too many people about your restaurant.  But not nearly as many as I will now.    The police were great.  They all but acknowledged that you guys were dicks.  They laughed with us and spent a good 15 minutes just basically being \"good guys\" and suggested with a wink that Carlsbad Cavern is a much better place for dinner anyways.  They knew that we were right and you guys were creeps.    Goodbye Uncle Sal.  You don't deserve my business.",

    "text": "I'm super disappointed by this place. I go to Side Door Corner Store (owned by the same people and share a kitchen) and love it. I've been meaning to try Uncle Sal's because I always hear great things about their food.  I came here last night for dinner with a group of girls and it's obvious we were out of place - everyone in the joint belonged in the geriatric department...not that I'm hating on it. Great food is great food and I don't care who eats where but if you're looking for a posh happenin spot to dine, this wouldn't exactly have the best vibes.   I think the biggest disappointment was the service. Though I'm sure she is nice lady, I felt like maybe she was overwhelmed because she seemed confused on just about everything. They were out of a tortellini dish and that's what my friend wanted to order so it's not rocket science that if you're out of one stuffed pasta, just replace it with another. My friend asked for the ravioli instead...shouldn't be that hard. The server acted like we were speaking martian. My friend was the first to order and as that whole bit was going down, I looked around at the rest of the table and you could just see the look of frustration on everyone's face...like for fuck's sake, this server is gonna be the death us. Bear in mind, many of us have worked in the industry so we know our shit and aren't usually overly critical. The check comes out and they charged my friends so much extra - like if you get a Caesar salad vs the house salad with your entree, there's an upcharge. Don't you think as a server, you would say something to your guest as a warning? She couldn't remember which wines we were drinking...it was just a clusterfuck and totally ruined the dining experience.   I ordered the steamed mussels and a side of the meatballs. The meatballs were cold...but the sauce was hot and the dish was hot. IDK if they just warmed up my food in the microwave or what, I didn't speak up because the server was already on my nerves and I didn't want to have to interact with her any more than necessary.   Another annoying thing is they don't do separate checks - the vibe when I saw that on the menu screaming at me was irritating. I get it. Split checks are so annoying, but guess what - so is your antiquated order taking system. She must not have a POS system to ring up on because the check came out and it was on the old school hand written checks. Seems like the restaurant owners aren't looking to get up with technology, but it's effecting the service and that needs to change ASAP.   Other than my meatballs being cold, the food is great which is why they get 2 stars. I really want to give it 3 but I don't think I'll come back unless I'm sitting at the bar, there are just other Italian options out there where service and food make for a better overall dining experience. Sorry Sal. Not into it.",

They were sat at a table for 4 in the bar area because my husband was to meet us. He was caught up at work and ended up not being able to join. The woman tending bar yelled at us and told us we had to move from the table because we were no longer a party of 4. The majority of her bar and all of the dining area was empty so it made absolutely no sense that she would be kicking out 3 paying customers from her section. She made a huge scene when I asked to speak to her manager who was not there and told us if she was us she would just leave and proceeded to get her regulars at the bar to chime in and insult us as well. It was the most ridiculous and insulting experience I've ever had in my 36 years of life! She completely ruined an annual tradition which had in the past always been a pleasant experience. I have worked in the service industry for several years and I've never seen anything so uncalled for. Don't EVER dine here if you expect to be treated like a human being let alone a customer.",

We came in for a birthday dinner and we are a polite bunch; we say thank you and try to be pleasant.  Scott never said you are welcome--he was snotty and spent most of the dinner chatting up the host who was clearly his boss.  This guy was awful.  When I started to be rude back to him, suddenly it was like he remembered what his job was and he started be obsequious.  It really ruined the dinner.  I hope that management reads this and addresses the issue.  If we return we will make sure Scott isn't our waiter.",

    "text": "I was craving some Italian food in a casual setting and browsing this Uncle Sal's Yelp entry yielded terms like \"old school,\" and \"basic.\"  I was definitely jonesing for some \"old school\" Italian food (I'm assuming this meant old school 70's 80's Americana old school).  Anyway, the second I stepped in this place I had a good feeling about it.  With each progressive course, from getting my drink frequently refilled, to the garlic bread, and the ridiculously basic soup/salad, I was liking this place more and more.  Unfortunately, the Lady wasn't feeling that well and we got our entrees to go and ate the rest in the hotel room and the next morning.  Regardless of sitting in some aluminum containers and not going through any reheating, the food was still great.    This isn't the best uh.... \"American Italian\" that you'll ever have, but it's pretty damned good and it totally hit the spot.  Dishes we've had:  Stuffed Mushrooms - drowning in alfredo sauce, with some sort of... pepperoni breadcrumb filling?  This was quite delicious.  Clams Oreganada - sure this dish is ridiculously simple and easy to make, but that doesn't keep it from being freaking delicious.  The Lady's first thing when opening the menu was \"you're getting the clams, aren't you.\"  Salad - You know when you've lived in St. Louis for too long when you're like \"damnit, I forgot to ask them to hold the CHEESE!\"  and then be like \"oh ok... it's just mozzarella...\"  Cream of Mushroom Soup - mmmm...  Veal Saltimbocca - pretty decent  Rack of Lamb Marsala - This was excellent.  It was even good at room temp the next morning.",

Had forgotten how good it was, and especially the garlic bread always brought for free at the beginning. Came with my wife, daughter and her boyfriend for his pre-triathalon pasta. Two huge chicken dished and two calamari Fra Diablos later, we were stuffed. One note - the Fra Diablo was too mild for my, and even my daughter's taste. I should have realized when I saw the much older clientele, typical of the neighborhood. Easily solved upon ordering. And the prices were incredibly fair, $110, with 3 glasses of wine, tax and tip for the four of us.",

She sat us in the back.. we each ordered a drink and just relaxing..after about 15 min we started to feel a little presured to order our meal.. the waiter then came over and told us he \"got yelled at\" for not taking our order.. most likley by that little bitch at the front desk.. we ordered our meal and a bottle of wine.. we finished our meal but still had wine.. again we began to feel pressured to leave.. the bar was not an option due to my friend's disability.. Long story short... aprox less then 90 min, $130.00 later we were out of there... very disapointed",

The bartender was very attentive and our glasses were never empty. The food was good. I got the grilled chicken with the sauteed mushrooms and really enjoyed it. My friends enjoyed their steak and scallops as well. But by far, I have to say the tiramisu was amazing! I would go back for the tiramisu alone. It was creamy and light- just perfect!  Also, I found the other customers at the bar to be really friendly. We were interested in trying the pizza, and the people next to us shared one of their slices with us! Can't say that happens very often.  I'm from the East Coast, and have had a hard time finding good Italian places here in Phoenix. But I'll say, Uncle Sal's reminds me of a great Italian place back home  in NJ called Goodfellas... and the next time my parents come out here to visit, Uncle Sal's will definitely be one of our stops!",

That being said I was a fool I'll admit.  At the urging of my girlfriend to try something new, I finally accepted to go. It was for whatever reason very buys for a Tuesday, something I really can't complain about because a lot of what makes a restaurant one in which I want to return is the atmosphere, preferably not dread and you being the only one(s) eating there. I was taken aback by the fact that when you enter the restaurant you've basically entered  the geriatric society of Scottsdale. But the crowd is vibrant and there is definitely almost a \"neighborhood hangout\" feel which is extremely rare to find in Scottsdale From the conversations overheard I'd be cool with having any of them as grandparents.The decor felt no so much Mediterranean or Italian as it did that of a country club or vessel but it was still homey atmosphere and well done.  As for the food, I had the tortellini alla panna and my girlfriend got the lasagna. I've never been a big fan of restaurant lasagna to be honest (other than in Europe) and this dish was pretty good. I have to give a big thumbs up to the side salad. Delicious basically.   The service was perfect, the atmosphere despite (yes you can hate on me) the fact that we were half the age of everyone there was really pleasant. Definitely felt like Cheers but with great food.",

Tip: They have special prices at the bar, and it's a great place to sit for parties of 1-3.  We had the short rib (bar portion) and stuffed mushrooms to share. Nothing not to  L-O-V-E of this dishes. The mushrooms are in a thick cheese sauce and the brisket in a juice that you can soak the garlic bread to reach a food nirvana.   I also ordered the file (11 oz) with gorgonzola sauce and fries. WOW. Seriously 5 people around me were drooling and asking me how it was. The guy next to me said that he would order that next week.  But be careful, the servings are pretty generous. I ended up leaving like 1/4 of the filet.  I strongly recommend to order several dishes to share everything, you know what they say, right? \"Sharing is caring\".  Again, don't expect a fancy pretentious place or up-scale restaurant. But the food quality, servings and price point are unbeatable.   If I have to complain about something, I believe the restrooms need to be updated.   Cheers.

It's no wonder - it seems there was only one waitress doing all the work.  She was very attentive when she actually had time for us.  I don't \"blame\" her one bit - for a place as popular as Uncle Sal's, it seems management should be aware of how many servers they need on staff.  I dunno - maybe somebody called in sick.  At any rate - I got the chicken Scarpariello and it was outstanding.  Wonderful flavor, expertly cooked.  The \"joint\" was quaint and neighborly - I bet it has a great vibe at night.  The decor was so very 30 years ago - which was awesome.  It reminds me of the little places where the husband and wife are in the back cooking, all the kids are servers and the old grandma who only speaks Italian is in back stirring a pot of gravy.  Sigh... memories...  Only people who truly appreciate what it means to eat at a family restaurant will \"get\" this place.  It's sad that so many people hold Olive Garden or some other God-awful chain in such high regard as to grade everyone else according to that standard.    Good job, Uncle Sal's - you impressed me!",

    "text": "Went based on a recommendation and well....  I wasn't impressed.  First, it was so dark in there that it was hard to tell how clean the place was.  The iced tea was too strong.  Our server couldn't tell me what was in the stuffed mushrooms.  The garlic bread was very garlicky and my chicken Marsala actually had piccata sauce on it.  It came with green beans and onions.  They should have left out the onions.  There was so much butter on them that it ruined the piccata sauce, which was tasty even though it was not what I ordered.  The salad had one, yes one, cherry tomato.  Could they spare it?  And they were stingy with the spaghetti too.  Hubby's sausage and peppers were average.  We took a piece of cheesecake home and it was awful!  It tasted like it sat in the refrigerator uncovered so it absorbed all of the other odors and the crust was burnt.  Sorry Uncle Sal's just was not up to par.",

    "text": "Uncle Sal's was recommended by a friend. Being raised in New York City (and having an Italian grandmother), I love Italian food.  Four of us went on the busiest night  of the week, the Saturday before Easter Sunday. The food was impeccable. My cioppino was more than almost anyone could eat, the seafood was excellent. My friends' entrees were lasagna (meat), gnocchi and lobster ravioli. All were superb. We shared 2 orders of the Mozarella Caprese. The tomatoes were soft enough to be ripe and the cheese was melted perfectly. Caesar salads were had by all. My only small nitpick was that anchovies had to be specified, they aren't automatic. The carafe of red vino di casa was fine.  The service was excellent. The waitstaff was there for us when we needed them without being intrusive.   Excellent food. This restaurant wouldn't be out of place in Little Italy in NYC, the North End of Boston or Federal Hill in Providence.",

    "text": "Amazing food. Awful, awful service.   The garlic bread...very good. Softer than I expected, which was nice. I also just wasn't expecting garlic bread. So it was a nice surprise.   Escargot - I was the only one at the table (of 10) to eat it. They were great! Served bubbling hot, not rubbery at all, delicious sauce. I kept the dish to dip bread into just because of the sauce.   Veal scarpariello - amazing. Everything tasted fantastic. Ok, the carrots that were on the side were a bit plain and could have been softer, but the veal itself and the sauce it was in, and the mushrooms and pasta...I left nothing on my plate.  My husband got the same and also had the same impression.   Creme brulee - fantastic. Tasted great, good texture. Pleasantly surprised.  My husband got the tiramisu and said it was great.   So why the 3 stars when the food was so amazing? Because of the terrible service.  1 - we got water. Great. But our server *never* asked us if we wanted anything else. When my husband finally stopped him to ask for a glass for my father in law, a coke for myself and other drinks, our server looked very inconvenienced by it.  2 - didn't get to order appetizers. You see I got escargot? I ordered that with my meal. Our server never asked about appetizers and went straight to meals. Also, my husband was walking with our daughter when the ordering was starting and needed an extra minute. Our server wanted to start with him. When asked if he could start with someone else's order, our server protested, but eventually did move on to the next person. You'd think starting at the next person was asking him to cut off his hand.  3 - empty glasses everywhere! Never got or was offered a refill on my drink. Or anyone else's. When my father stopped our server well after our meal was over and asked if I could get a coke, our server said I had never ordered one. Well of course I hadn't...I never had a chance to! 4 - offering dessert seemed a complete afterthought.   Will I recommend this place to anyone else? Conditionally. I'll make sure to tell them that the food was very good, but not to go if they want attentive service, are on any kind of time constraint, expect refills on their drinks, or are at all shy about getting a server's attention.",

Alot of guests seemed like they knew each other and the staff, so it had a very homey and welcoming feel. They had an extensive wine list, too bad they didn't have a Moscato (my new favorite), but we ordered the Riesling instead, which was still wonderful. I had the Chicken Saltimboca, mom had the braised beef and her husband had the Eggplant Rollintini. Everything was very tasty. Not greasy, heavy and over salted. Just real flavors of all the food. They also bring out the best garlic bread, I must have ate 8 pieces! The cannoli was made exactly how it should be made and the tartufo was excellent along with an Illy espresso. YUM!! What a very pleasant dining and food experience. I will definitely be back!",

Uncle Sal's is a legit spot for a nice dinner.  As soon as you walk in, you are treated to a nice, quiet, classy place. It's so \"NOT SCOTTSDALE\"....so if you are looking for a scene, go elsewhere.   This is where you take someone special for their birthday, or your parents when they come visit. The type of place where you WANT to engage in a conversation.   The server is very friendly....and even remembers you if you come back.  The menu has something for EVERYONE, vegetarians, pescatarians, and carnivores alike.  The wine list is quite good (with awards from Wine Spectator), and a cozy bar as well.  There are only 15 or so tables, so if you want a table, call ahead for a reservation. It will help.  You'll like this spot....but don't come here expecting Culinary Dropout, or Sapporo type of a vibe. It's an old school, quiet type of place. Enjoy!",

Gratuity is added on after 6 people we had 7 so I guess she felt she could just do whatever and we could wait however long.

Our waitress had about 5 tables we watched her walking to. Waiting way to long for bread made my family and I ready to order appetizers. We requested the stuffed mushroom and also asked for a small dish to dip the bread into with Alfredo. We were then informed that the food is basically made ahead of time and sounds like they ship in frozen food and just warm it. You would never believe it. Having to practically beg our waitress for bread and a refill for drinks. So frustrating. We then called another girl over and when our waitress saw she proceeded to get frustrated, even though we had asked 10 minutes prior. Our appetizers took way to long and the food was done by the time the APPETIZER came out. One of the dishes we ordered we asked for no chicken... GUESS WHAT. BIG CHUNKS OF CHICKEN. horrible horrible service when it was basically is  one big complaint and our waitress not caring and saying \"happy birthday\" to my grandfather when he got the chicken he specifically asked 4 times to not have. The manager looking carelessly and never even asked how we were doing.",

This is supposed to be some ridiculously good authentic Italian restaurant that draws in celebrity assholes like Harvey Weinstein, but we ordered food from here on door dash and it was utterly flavorless, dry, and inedible. I immediately grabbed the salt shaker because apparently Uncle Sal doesn't believe in salt, and my boyfriend said \"you too\"? He had already doused his food in salt as well. Even after salting it, I just could not eat it. I think I ate two bites and gave the rest to the dogs. I ordered the lasagna, and I make a vegan lasagna that is far superior to the garbage lasagna they are putting out and having the audacity to charge SEVENTEEN dollars for. I would not call it bad, it was just plain gross. I see some reviews here that make no sense to me. Have these people eaten food before? Are we talking about the SAME RESTAURANT? Do they need a tongue transplant? My boyfriends food was also terrible and we both ended up eating Cheetos. We were beyond disappointed because not only is it WAY over priced, but we also paid a rather large delivery fee plus tip. We used to get food from here over 5 years ago, and it was really good, but since then things have taken a serious turn for the worst. Expensive lesson learned. Order from sauce. The food is excellent and so are the prices. No, no, no, no, no. Just no.",

Some of the people I was with were a bit complicated, but the manager and the servers were so wonderful and nice. Everything we ordered, down to the salad, was delicious. I can't say enough great things about this place. I highly recommend it!!",

My new go-to for some good ole fashioned Italian! Great wine list, amazing food, and best melt in your mouth garlic bread!! Can't wait to go back.    Arrived about 8:30 on a Sat evening (middle of summer). Bar was still full but not packed, and the restaurant was about a qtr full. Perfect ambiance for a casual later dinner.  Only sad that I've lived here 13 yrs and am just now trying it.",

Even after we said something to the hostesses she just told us Merry Christmas and walked away. The manager walked by our table 10 times and never said anything to us. We walked right by Sheldon on our way out and he still didn't say anything! My family and I will never be coming back to this place. Also going to report this to the health department.",

    "text": "The food- AMAZING! NO Complaints.  The service- awful, just awful!!! Looking at you Johnny.   Came here tonight for the first time with my aunt, I live a bloack away, so it is very convenient. We sat in the bar area. We ordered our own entrees which included sides. We ordered one drink each, but the server seemed irritated we didn't want to order more drinks. But since we were both driving, we did not want to put ourselves at risk. He kept giving us the feeling as though he was irritated at us, like when I asked for water, he was visibly annoyed. We order our food, and when he brought our food, didn't even acknowledge us, or ask if we needed anything which, we did! He didn't give us utensils, or makes sure anything else we need will be met. I went up to the bar, ask for utensils, so that I can begin my meal.   We had to wait 15 minutes with dirty plates on the table before he cleared them, and then he left and did not give me a chance to ask for the bill. Another 10 minutes passes, and finally I do, and he again doesn't acknowledge, so I asked again, to which he sternly said that he heard me.. ok like you didn't say anything, it's loud at dinner time.. I was just making sure because you have not checked up on us and we don't want to just sit here all night. Bill arrives, and heres the best part! He charged for extra things which were not ordered. For example, he charged for salads, but neither my aunt or I got a salad, just the sides that were included in the entrees.. He asked if the bill was ready and I asked if he could break it down? He became argumentative and said what is there to break down? I said well what is this charge? Pointing to a random number he wrote down in the middle of the check, he said that it was salad, I said ok,, but we didn't order salads, he said yeah they are on side, you did. I said, no, that was included.. on their menu, it clearly states is included into the entree. He was very pissed, and I was not going to argue with him any more.   He tried pulling the old server trick, adding and uncharging to the bill, padding it a little more, well it didn't work. He got caught.  Again- great food, so good, like reallllyyyy good! But when servers try to cheat the system, thats just wrong.. and not worth going back to.",

We always start with a fabulous bottle of wine {...last night we had the Coppola Cab & it was amazing!} and their Frito Misto {fried calamari & shrimp} that is served with with their homemade marinara sauce.   For the entree, I LOVE their Scallops Piccatta. It is so buttery and delicious. Comfort food at its finest, that's for sure! It comes with your choice of a house salad or their soup of the day. I always get the house salad with their homemade Italian dressing. If you're looking to dine at a cozy Italian neighborhood favorite, I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat!   Side Note: You probably want to plan on heading home to watch a movie and relax after dinner because you WILL be in a food coma!!",

The bartender, Toni, greeted us and quickly brought us a couple of nicely-poured glasses of wine. The bar had a very nice energy to it, all of the help were busting their rear end to give very good service.  My wife's lasagna was excellent, a nice-sized portion. I had the Italian sausage with mushrooms and peppers. It was excellent, very nice flavor.   No happy hour, but overall the prices are fair, especially on the bar menu. Three TV's showing different games, but not many people (an older crowd) seemed to care.   We would give Uncle Sal's 6 stars if we could, just because of the friendly, rapid, always looking out for customers needing a refill, service of Toni, our bartender. She was funny and has built up a very good rapport with some obvious faithful diners.   We really enjoyed Uncle Sal's and will definitely be going back to say hello to Toni and enjoy some more food and wine.",

The service was extremely attentive and the busser cleaned the table off as soon as the salad was done or drinks were empty. Very efficient! My disappointment came with dessert.  I ordered the creme brulee again, hoping it would be better than the last time.  It wasn't.  The dessert chef needs to learn how to make a proper custard. It should be creamy and set and chilled before the sugar is put on top and carmelized. Just like last time, underneath the beautifully carmelized sugar was the consistency of soft whipped cream, very runny. The flavor was good, but it was not custard.  Until the dessert chef gets it right, it should be off the menu.  I would have given five stars if it weren't for the creme brulee fail. Uncle Sal's is one of my favorite restaurants, but I will try the cannoli next time, as one of my dining partners said it was phenomenal.",

One of my kids ordered the Cannelloni, he also loved it. My daughter had the tortellini alla panna, but the prosciutto was missing. She said it was still good but was disappointed about the prosciutto. My youngest ordered the ravioli and I had the lasagna. Honestly the flavor of my lasagna was amazing but it was served to me warm, not hot like it just got out of the oven. That was the same thing wrong with the ravioli it was barely warm. Again the flavor was amazing, my son liked it, but it just wasn't hot when served.",

Although it took me 5 minutes to realize this since he was busy talking to friends while I waited to order. Asked the hostess to speak with a manager & was advised to call him Mon-Fri during biz hours. Kind of like dealing with a bank & not a place for enjoying food & refreshments.  Still haven't tried their food or drink & never will as too many good places in Scottsdale that don't express the attitude of this joint. Could say more, but why bother!!  I give them no stars.",

Last one won the table but all were great. Will come again, great service.",

But that's nothing new because I can think of one place I have been recently where the wait staff didn't do something strange. She recommended about 7 different things when I asked...which always frustrates me cause I don't that many. I do believe I said between chicken and the specials and she started talking about seafood. Meh.  They start you off with garlic bread, which is cool! But not the exact flavor my mouth desires of such treasures. Bummer.  Decent caesar, which has been hard to come by recently, annnd the penne bake. Oh my good. Cheese. More cheese. Gooey cheese. Broiled cheese. Ricotta cheese. Yes. My company said it was \"okay\"...he doesn't like cheese so a) I don't trust him anyways and b) his opinion is irrelevant.  If you read my review on the blind pig (which I don't think you did but they are the same owners so this feels repetitive) the short rib is great. But they put it over plain pasta. So weird. Beef broth, shredded like beef and spaghetti. Hehhhh. Good flavor though! Again...the people were so friendly! Anyways...go and support local business. Worth it.",

It is so hard to get anything even close to authentic Italian in this desert....well, I really enjoyed everrything, my guests were gushing. Of course I had to try the hot wings, cuz I always do. They were excellent, no complaints, nice buffalo sauce and perfectly cooked. No, they really do not go with Italian food, but I went to college near Buffalo so I am addicted. We sampled a nice selection. The seafood dishes were good, Fra Diavolo sauce was right on, shrimp a bit chewy. The bar menu had a sausage and pepper entree that brought me back to the boardwalk. Of course, it didn't have that Newark bread we all love, but it was delicious. Their marinara was cooked down and flavorful, deep and dark. Some places seem to pour it our of the can. And meals come with salad!! AND GARLIC BREAD! Good, toasted garlic bread with flavor!! Drinks were great, wait staff was great, nice vibe. A bit of an older crowd, but that's the sign of a great Italian joint, right? I didn't get to try the Marsala...but the chopped steak smothered with onions was a crowd fave. So I vote thumbs up. I will be back. Oh, and happy hour specials, too.",

They make their own Caesar dressing, and it is a creamy and absurdly delicious recipe.  I actually buy it from the restaurant to take home; they will sell the dressing in a soup container for five dollars. As for the eggplant, the real star of this dish is actually the ricotta filling, which is a delicious ricotta with Italian herbs stuffed into perfectly cooked eggplant and topped with homemade marinara. I have also had the pizza here, and perhaps it's because I'm from New Jersey and/or a bit of a pizza snob, but I only thought it was Ok... nothing to write home about. The mediocre pizza aside, the eggplant, Caesar salad/dressing, and the garlic bread are all delectable, mouthwatering foods you will love.",

    "text": "Nice Italian restaurant in a strip mall. Once inside, you forget that you're in Arizona.  The food was average, but service impeccable. In fact, I was beyond disappointed in the flavor of the food as I had heard so many positive comments on this restaurant.   The escargot appetizer was the best of everything we tried. Dipping the tasty garlic bread in the hot butter sauce is a great way to clean up the appetizer. Every other food item just seemed to be missing something. The house salad with blue cheese was okay. Very mild tasting. Youbarely taste the dressing and the mozzarella garnered more of the attention. The salad definitely could have used some blue cheese crumbles. The crab bisque had a decent flavor, but you could tell fake crab was used. The chicken, veal and spinach cannelloni was far too mushy and needed a little more meatiness to it. The Veal Mario was very flavorful with the sun dried tomatoes, but the meat was overcooked. The Shrimp and Scallop Antoinette had the best combination of flavors of all the dishes. Shrimp a little overdone, but scallops were cooked perfect, as was the pasta. Great dish! The meatball side dish we shared as a table (you get two) were dry and had no flavor. I expected a lot more from meatballs from a True Italian restaurant.   The service was incredible with very knowledgeable and friendly staff. They always had water glasses filled and the waiter (Nick) timed and served the different courses of the meal perfectly. We never felt rushed or like we we're waiting too long for the next item.   While the flavor of the food was not at the level I expected, Uncles Sal's is worth a try. I'll be back as the service was great, and maybe the cooks were just having an off night!",

Were initially told that nothing was available until after 8.  After talking with another hostess, we were told we could be seated on the patio.  We showed up at 4, and there were only two other parties seated.  Still we were seated on the patio, facing the sun. We were told we were lucky to get our reservations in when we did.

My husband however got to pick his dressing and got ranch which he thought was delicious. The sphagetti was decent, a little watery which was annoying and served super hot! They could have waiting a few minutes before serving our meals. We finished with the chocolate mouse cake which was sub par. It was dry and a little too rich.   Over all it was a cozy place.

Uncle Sal's is a little difficult to locate (as are most mob hangouts). It's located in an unassuming strip mall, which doesn't add to the credibility of the restaurant, but Sal's is an exception.

    "text": "I usually do not write reviews but I was so disappointed in this restaurant I had to voice it. My friends and family were in Scottsdale for Easter weekend and decided to eat here based on the reviews. We were expecting a nice family Italian restaurant with great service and authentic food. This was not the case at all. Our waiter never introduced himself, did not explain the specials , nor did he ask us if we had  any questions about the menu. I felt like we were at a fast food diner not a star rated restaurant. Our drinks were never refilled unless we asked and our plates were rudely placed with a loud thud on the table. The food was just okay but the service was terrible. I would never go back. This was one of my worst experiences ever . We would have had a better dinner and experience at Olive Garden. Don't waste your time or money here.",

The people that work there are fun, outgoing, and make sure you are 100% satisfied with your order. After going there 3 times in 5 months, when we walk in we are greeted as friends! They remember our names, tease us for not coming in more often, and they'll even 'buy' us a glass of wine every now and then. They are great!   The FOOD is even better! I go there for lunch (Chiken marsala is DEVINE) and for dinner, I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like. I couldn't recommend this more highly!",

    "text": "Eggplant parmigiana is the best I've tried, and I'm Italian with an Italian family that loves to cook.  I'm not going to say that everything on their menu is as good as the eggplant but this is an above average Italian restaurant with some excellent treasures on the menu.  If you go before 5pm or order before 5pm you get lunch prices which are very reasonable for the same dinner portions.  Great deal!  And did I mention the eggplant?",

    "text": "this is again one those where I would love to do 3 1/2.  3 really isnt fair but 4 would be over doin it.  For out here it would be awesome but when you grow up on east coast italian food... it just is not the same.  That said I loved the way the bar was packed with older crowd for happy hour.  That was very Jersey like.  The food was very good. bruschetta was tasty. salad had shredded mozarella and I had a chicken in white wine sauce main course.  I have to say it was very good.  Oh and there marinara sauce is a heavy red with a bit of a spice and I thought it was awesome.  Next time up Im going with a red dish. that was actually the highlight.  Overall, good price and the menu is a very wide variety.  I like Uncle Sal.",

You know you've gone too far on Hayden when you've passed the Starbucks in the same strip mall.   Soups at Uncle Sal's are incredible.  I'm not sure what they put in them, but it's a good thing.  If you're in the soup mood, or even if you're not, get the soup!    The bar is not too big so, when it's full, it's really full.  But it's cozy.  (This is a great place to go on a date, though it is kind of spendy.)  The decor is very old fashioned and the tables are a bit tight here and there, but the restaurant can accommodate large groups.  You can also sit outside at some small tables that hug the side of the restaurant.  I highly recommend the Calimari appetizer and the Chicken Marsala. Also, the Cannoli are fantastic.  The shells are authentic; you can really taste the Italian cinnamon :)  I split mine but they are not too big to gobble down yourself.  Love it!",

    "text": "Since we're staying for a week in Arizona, it was our time to experiment. Tonight we decided on Italian, and I went searching for local Italian restaurants and landed upon Uncle Sal's. The other site had good reviews and came onto Yelp to check for fellow yelpers reviews as well. We also liked that we could check out the menu for what they offered.   There was no wait at all, we were seated immediately. The host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We asked for the patio seats. We came in around 8:30. The inside decor very homey old-fashioned, like your grandmother's kitchen.   They came out with complimentary delicious garlic bread slices. With all our orders came with sides of either soup or salad. The soup for the night was Butter Nut Squash and it was delicious. The salad was yummy as well with their Ranch dressing. We would've liked a little more of that savory Ranch dressing. But overall delicious.   We ordered the Shrimp Fradiovolo, Baked Ziti, and Chicken Piccatta. My Shrimp Fradiovolo had jumbo shrimps which were sweet and plump. Although the tomato sauce that accompanied it was a little too sour for my taste and wasn't spicy like it had specified. My sister got the Baked Ziti and she enjoyed it very much. My husband got the Chicken Piccatta which was a little salty but went perfectly with the side pasta marinara. We also ordered a Tiramisu togo but we haven't tried it yet.  The service was awesome! Our waiter was very attentive and checked up on us. Since we sat out in the patio, we had asked our waiter the smoking policy. He said their restaurant allowed smoking outside. Also, our soda & water cups were never ever empty. The other server who refilled water and took our plates was not as friendly but he did a good job.   Overall we were very satisfied with this restaurant. We'd recommend this to anyone who's staying in the area, or who wants to venture around. Also, it's a little hard to find, but it's in same plaza as Carl's Jr. The plaza after Circle K.  Edit: We ate the tiramisu late at night, and we loved it! It was a big piece of tiramisu. You get your money's worth, between the 3 of us we didn't even finish it. It was very fluffy, the liquor was subtle but you could taste it. And you could taste it was freshly made.",

    "text": "I have such conflict leaving a 1 star review for Uncle Sal's. Why? Because I LOVE Uncle Sal's food. I have been eating here off and on for years and live close by. Make no mistake; it's some of the tastiest Italian fare around--I have never had a bad meal. The problem? A cockroach infestation. Yes--infestation. One need only keep ones eyes open. In June, I went to eat for my birthday. As we were sitting awaiting our meal, a small cockroach scurried across our table. Ok--one measly roach--I can handle that as an anomaly. But when I went back again in about 4 weeks with a friend for lunch, we waited in a back booth (for 20 minutes I might add) for someone to take our order (that's a whole other story--seems the lunch wait staff becomes somewhat frazzled when they get a rush--an acknowledgement, or a simple \"haven't forgotten about you, will be right there\" would have sufficed)--we sat waiting and as we both looked at the brick wall over the heads of a table of some gentlemen having a biz lunch, we both noticed 2-3 little roaches darting in and out of the cracks of the wall. My friend and I simultaneously said: \"are you seeing what I am seeing?\" And agreed in unison to leave. As we passed our apparition of a wait person on our way out, I informed this person that we were leaving and why. She simply looked at me with very little expression and said (I kid you not) \"oh, I know we have roaches, they are just active because we sprayed recently\". I informed her that one scurried across my table a month ago as well. She just shrugged. Sigh. Sorry to do this to you Uncle Sal's, but until you can have someone get in there and bomb the place, And claim you are roach free, I simply have no interest in sharing my meal with an army of 6 legged buggies. I can only imagine how many of them could be lurking in the kitchen and I am no wuss. Beware. Sad state of affairs. I miss you, Uncle Sal's, but not that much.",
