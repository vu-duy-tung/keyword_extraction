Both my burnt ends and her brisket were room temperature. We told the manager who was nice enough to offer replacements, (I'd already eaten half my food so it'd be a waste to get more for me) but my girlfriends brisket burger came much faster than when we had first ordered it.   The brisket for her replacement looked terrible, like they quickly cooked some trimmings they'd originally planned to throw away, and tasted weird. She didn't eat more than half a bite.   We had to go and didn't want to take up anymore time, they comped her meal (she didn't eat either burger) and with tip I paid over $20 for one room temperature plate of meat that was actually eaten with some fries.   We'll stay with the Peoria locations from now on.",

On top of that they also offered a 20% discount if you stayed for dinner or did carry out. We stayed for dinner. I forgot to mention the discount to our server so ended up paying full price for four people. I emailed the manager who had arranged the taste testing and told him about my brain fart. He gave me his number and told me to call before my next and he would arrange for me to get that discount. Awesome customer service and one more reason to stay a loyal customer. Thanks.",

The cornbread muffins were a little too sweet for me. Every famous staff member was super professional and friendly! Awesome. Our food came so quickly I thought it couldn't be ours.

When I placed my order, I also placed an order for a salad to go, assuming that was enough time to make one salad to hand to me as I paid for my order. The server took forever to come hand us the check, and as he handed us the check he said that my salad would be out shortly. The salad did not come out, about 10 minutes later another server said he would go check on it. 10-15 minutes later, I still did not have the salad. I asked the server if I could just get a refund because I had to go, I was on my lunch break. He told me that the salad was ready and that his manager was coming to talk to me. The manager came and apologized and informed me they \"goofed\". He gave me coupons and said he would like to have me come back. I placed a to-go order today and used my coupon for a free order of TWELVE wings, I got to work and checked the box of wings, and there was only FIVE wings in the box. Not to mention that the manager that came up to assist with getting the coupon applied to my order, was on his cell phone and did not acknowledge me for one second. I will never be going back there again.",

When we asked our waiter to tell us about the menu he just merely pointed out each section of the menu not recommending any particular foods, Granted she couldn't of been a day over 18 either and he was just doing as he was told. Our food was decent, our service was decent, the food tasted fine. It could've been hotter for sure (Temperature wise). I did like all the different kinds of barbecue sauce that were at the table and mixing a couple of them together made for a perfect blend. The sides all tasted good. The corn muffin that came with my meal was probably the highlight of it.... That being said next time i crave bbq i might throw a piece of chicken on the grill with sauce and call it a day. If you're ever in San Diego and want good barbecue that will knock your socks off go to Phil's BBQ! It has ruined me for life and no other barbecue compares... Sorry Famous Dave .... I really wanted to like you a lot ...",

As a fish enthusiast I pondered the BBQ choices but gravitated to the beer-battered cod to accompany a tall Sam.  The waiter commented he has the beer-battered cod sandwich every week but I chose the beer-battered cod combo in order to try sides of beans and coleslaw.  The beans were not the ordinary baked beans  out of the can but had a fancy name called Wilbur beans (\"baked beans loaded with smoked pork, brisket, hot link and jalapeno peppers\").  Although I added one of the mild sauces the beans were quite tasty.  The coleslaw was also not the ordinary store bought coleslaw but was called creamy coleslaw (\"A zesty slaw that's pineapple sweet with a hint of horseradish\"}.  Again quite tasty.  Getting back to the cod it was real fish that flaked like it should!! The cod was a generous portion and I actually received enough tartar sauce without asking for seconds.  All in all, a good choice after a long hike in the Superstitions with a stop off at Bass Pro for hiking essentials.",

We were sat by the bar which I feel was the root of our problems. First my mother's coffee was never refilled, we had an appetizer and about 45 minutes waiting for our order the waiter finally showed back up and asked if we wanted to box up our food? I answered, we're still waiting for our order before we decide what's getting boxed. Then after I finished my soda I found lemon seeds in my cup. Apparently it was used for ice tea but never cleaned so I was given a dirty cup to drink from. Finally almost an hour our food shows up. My mother's mashed potatoes were cold and both our plates had leather for meat. My plate was uneatable. Like I said this is a first for us the many times we've eaten there. I have no clue about why we were ignored but I believe whoever was cooking has no passion for cooking BBQ let alone cooking",

I'm so annoyed that I promise you this will be my last visit. Server is very professional, but when she initially saw she had another table she was annoyed. Sorry you have to do your JOB!!!",

Not the case at all. Though our waiter had a nice personality, he had to be one of the worst servers ever. We told him we were ready to order, and he said he would be right back. After 20 minutes, we asked him to take our order. We waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food to arrive cold. The butter wouldn't even begin to melt on my baked potato. The food tasted good, it just wasn't hot. The manager did come by and check on us, and offered to heat it up. At this point, I did not want to send anything back, because I never send anything back, if you know what I mean. With so many choices out here, I won't be in any type of hurry to return. Restaurant prices are pretty steep, so I expect to enjoy a meal that I'm paying a decent amount of money for.",

    "text": "I was in the mood for some catfish there isn't a whole lot of options I know off close by home. So I looked on like at the Famous Daves menu it showed the lunch times are from 11-5. It wasn't 4:30 yet I went quickly hit there about 4:25. I waited at the stand to be seated it wasn't busy the lady at the bar made eye contact with me & a few servers walking around none bothered to speak. Just as I was about to go a lady came up to ask if we had been served yet. I replied no and she took us to a table. She wasn't very friendly, I really wanted catfish. I looked immediately for the lunch menu and the menu said lunch 11 to 4 and the price was $1 more than the website . I asked the hostess why there was a discrepancy in the times & price. She immediately went in the defence stating she was new and was told that these were new menus. I said well I came here based of what I saw on line and if that wasn't the case I would go else where. She huffed off to talk to someone who said they would allow me to order the lunch portion for today only with a snotty attitude and I suggested maybe you should update the site to match the menu then maybe people wouldn't be expecting things to be this way when they arrived. I am giving 2 starts for Dan who was my actual server he checked on us regularly he made snake take engaged with my son & he apologized for the error with out making it seem like I was at fault. Not sure who is to blame the company or the individual franchise but I hope the site matches the menus soon. My food was prepared correctly no other issues.",

We were seated quickly, no waiting for a table and the place was not that busy. We sat looking at the menus, deciding what we would try on this visit. We made our decisions and realized that nobody has even come by to ask for drink order.  We watched as waiters and waitresses came to the other tables. Never a glance in our direction. Another table got seated and a waiter showed up to take their drink order. We realized it had been over fifteen minutes since we were seated without anyone acknowledging us. So we decided to test the boundaries of our new found invisibility.  I brought the menus and silverware back to the person who seated us.  Let them know about our discovery of invisibility.  They didn't care enough to address the issue.  So out the door we went.    I'm glad Dave is so famous that he can ignore his customers.    I hope on your visit the wait staff can see you.",

There on line club gives you a free sandwich or burger, and the portion size of that is amazing. I also ordered the feast for one, which was $20. It was huge. We ended up taking a ton of food home with us. The chicken quarter was flavorful and not dry at all. The ribs are very good, the pulled pork was what you would expect. The Texas brisket was a bit dry for me. They have several sauces to pick from and if it's your first time they will come by and tell you a bit about each- it would be great if they would add a True Carolina gold and a sweet Tennessee sauce. The decor is great and I love the sink in the middle of the dining area to wash your hands.",

While waiting for our All-American order, I couldn't help gawking at the lip-smacking, finger-licking, happily chewing satisfied carnivores! I soon became one of them once we got home and got down to devouring ribs, chicken, and links. The table was quiet for the first few minutes.

The side of corn was overcooked, so we wouldn't order that again, but the rest of the food we had was great.  Service was good too - we sat in the booths in the bar area, and the waiters were alert, but not intrusive which was fabulous.",

I had a dinner salad with romaine lettuce, which sometimes is green and delicious but today was all the stem ends-WHITE, which means practically no nutrition compared to the general and less appetizing! I also ordered the happy hour regular chicken wings with sweet and zesty sauce. The picture on the happy hour menu shows a basket with about 8-10 wings, but I got a plate with 4 1/2 wings, one was literally cut in half! The sauce was definitely pineapple rage, which I like so I ate them. The wings cost $4.00, so I don't consider that a happy hour deal and False advertising,  misleading menu. The bartender Chenin was great as always, she was a bright spot in a dismal day!",

And I think the reason Dave's is Famous, is because they are good. The Mesa location is great. We always sit at the bar with ROCK STAR bartenders. ( Cole is great). They remember your face drink and treat you like gold. Place is clean. This past week I tried the hot wings. they were NOT Buffalo wings, they were smoky. But they were good. I will warn you NOT to get the hottest sauce. It hurts. For days. The rib dinners are good, They offer the smoky style and the saucy style. Burnt ends are a smoky treat and really great with beer. Shoestring onion rings awesome, coleslaw is my fave,  Anyhow, go here, Say hi to the bartenders and tell them they are legends. because they make good recommendations and will keep you entertained while you watch games on the numerous TVs above the bar. Try the wings, too, And GREAT Happy Hour prices...",

This is exactly what happened to me and my party, we were seated  in the bar even though the dining room was half empty and all because 2 people in my party were dressed in T-shirts and jeans. The host was going to seat us in the main dining room until he looked past me and decided that we did not fit their profile of the customer they want to have seen in their restaurant.  After spending years in the hospitality industry I was horrified by the blatant discrimination exhibited by the host and manager of this store/restaurant; apparently they are categorizing people who wear jeans as undesirable.  ON A SIDE NOTE: the service was so bad, no one in my party had the correct order served to them, they got everything wrong and the food was very disappointing, dried out and burned. So it's my feeling that's one can add sabotage to the discrimination as they want to make sure anyone who fits into this profile does not come back.  I will never be back and it's on to Lucille's!!'",

We buy BBQ brisket \"to-go\" so that we can make our own sandwiches at home. The beef is tender and slightly smokey. I have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times and service was great. The corn muffins and chicken are excellent. The sides are average. I like their sauces (not too sweet nor overpowering). This Famous Dave's BBQ is located at the Riverview shopping center at the 202 and Dobson. Easy parking and parking right next to the door for \"to go\" orders.",

The touch of sweetness really puts them ahead of the game!  The hosts and servers are always very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. This place can get pretty busy, but service never lacks because of it.  Also, you have to sample all their BBQ Sauces. Devils Spit, Sweet and Zesty, Rich and Sassy!

    "text": "One of the things I love most about birthdays - Free Meals!!  I received via email (join their PIG Email Club) a screamin coupon deal (free entree with entree purchase of equal or greater value, up to $15) for J's birthday.  Score!  Moved to the bar area, due to it being too hot where we were originally seated (right next to the to-go area).  Service in both areas was good.   Everything that came to the table -   Chips - Its a chip mystery.  Greasy, but somehow still crisp.  We would have preferred a bowl of pickle chips instead prior to our meal.   Speaking of the pickle chips - COSTCO sells them!  :D  After all the chips are gone, keep the brine!  I'll make some hard boiled eggs and pickle them in the brine.  J loves them!  Texas Manhandler - According to J - \"It was tasty.  The Brisket was tender, juicy and succulent.  The sausage had the right amount of snap and was well seasoned.  The addition of the Firecracker Pickles added a sweet and spicy dimension that made it an overall, highly enjoyable sandwich on some of the softest, yet robust buns.  With a little Devil's Spit BBQ Sauce, it is a must eat for the Carnivores out there.\"  Thanks J!  ;D  Southside Rib Tips - Huge portion! Tips were nice and meaty.  Cooked to perfection - Very tender.   Ear Corn - Not \"sweet corn\" but field corn (as Papa would call it). I think its boiled in sugar water to give it a slightly sweet taste.   Famous Fries - Nice thick cut steak/wedge style fries.  Lightly salted. Skip dipping in catsup!  But if you're a dipper, use the bbq sauces.   Drunkin' Apples - LOVE! Thank gawd somewhere else other than Cracker B. makes these.   Jalapeno Mac & Cheese - Awesomeeeeee!  Creamy with just a hint of a bite from the diced Jalapenos.  The corn provides a sweet and textural counterpoint to the pasta and cheese.  Corn Muffins - LOVE!  It reminds me of my own cornbread.  And I hate to say it , but they're better than mine.  If I can hold out, I usually save mine and eat it for breakfast the next morning. They have little muffin cups so you can take yours home.  :)  Famous Sundae - This was free and a surprise (because of J's birthday) The vanilla bean ice cream was not cloying. Ours was drizzled with delicious hot fudge and topped with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was a little much though.  If I would have known they were bringing it out, I would have asked them to go easy with the whip.   The portions they give you with the dinners are huge.  My leftovers (rib tips) lasted me for 2 days.  Ask for an extra muffin cup and take home some sauce for your leftovers.",

    "text": "The three of us ate at Famous Dave's last evening and had a really nice time!   We stopped in around 5:30 or so and were seated at a booth in the bar area. It was still early, so there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. Our server came by a few moments after we were seated and asked about our drink order. Nice.   If you have never been to a Famous Dave's, it's sort of like a Texas Roadhouse, which is a complement. I've had some really good BBQ over the years in local Roadhouses throughout the US, and clearly this chain has copied the model.   We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks. Both were good, but ordinary. What made them good was Dave's sauce. At each table you have five or six choices, as well as the sauce that came from the kitchen.   For dinner we order a Pulled-Pork sandwich with sides, a large BBQ Huli platter and some Texas steak tips grande nachos. Each was delicious and large enough that we couldn't finish. One observation on portions, they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large   For dessert we order some $1.98 mini puddings and brownies. Just the right size for everyone after a large dinner.   Fellow Yelper Scott D put it best in his 7/23/10 review: \"Famous Dave's consistently delivers no matter which location you go to\". Our party of three heartily agrees!   The tab came to $69.49, including taxes but without tip. We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food. We will be back!

It was after 8pm, so not a super busy rush.  We were seated and it was a full 15 min before our server, Mack, came to get our drink order.  We both ordered bar drinks and I also got an iced tea.  Ten min later, she brings the tea and another 10 min later, our bar drinks.  My husband asked about the typically provided chips, and she snapped back, \"they aren't bottomless\".  Not that it was an issue, but kinda rude.  She came back after stopping at 4 different tables to chat, drop off drinks and chat....to bring the chips.  We placed our order and off she went.  Our food came out fast but no offer for drink refills...and we never saw her again for another 15 min.  Still no offer for drink refills....and my husband is a big beer drinker but only had one this evening because Mack was busy working the room.  She came to clean up the plates....still no refill...and dropped off the check.  I immediately put my card in the folder and sat it at the end of the table.  She walked by 4 times and never took it.  Flitting around to other tables and gossiping with the hostess.  Everyone around us had been served and left and it was a whole new group.  She finally returned 15 min later after walking around the restaurant with my card and turned on the \"big tip charm\"...sadly she had already burned the tip bridge.  I don't know if she was just over worked , preoccupied or just plain lazy but I was super disappointed and will be hesitant to return.  I left 10% and a sad face.  Mack needs customer service training and basic server skills.",

    "text": "So my girlfriend and I went here on Saturday night 2/24 and arrived about 5:25 pm.  It was already unusually busy and we were told it would be around a twenty minute wait.    It was hard not to notice a fairly large amount of empty tables including patio seating that could've been used had they been properly staffed.  After waiting around 20-25 minutes we were finally seated in a back room of the restaurant.  We waited perhaps ten minutes for a server to bring us something as mundane as water but not only did they not arrive, there wasn't any sign of anyone to even flag down.  A party of six arrived and was seated next to us and about five minutes later a pleasant server appeared for them ready to accommodate their every need.  At this point I began to wonder if we were invisible.  We left shortly after this fiasco but I did inform the hostess that an additional two seats had immediately opened up in the back.  She clearly heard me and seemed to pay no never mind to our dissatisfaction.  To be fair, the establishment was under siege from a multitude of Cubs fans from a recently completed spring training game, however, I'd rather be told it would be a forty-five minute wait than be played for a sucker.  Pity that the Cubs fans they so desire to attract in the short term will be long gone while the local folk will still be remembering their treatment here for years to come.",

When my meal was served, it was chopped pork and roasted chicken.  I mentioned it to the server and she said that it was barbecue chicken and that she would put some more sauce on it.  Not what I wanted as the barbecue chicken is chopped and the roasted chicken is served on the bone.  She brought my same plate back with barbecue sauce all over the chicken.  A few minutes later, she approached the table and said that the server who took the order put it in the computer wrong and then walked away.  She made no attempts to make my order correct or offer to bring the correct meal out.  I am extremely disappointed in this level of service.",

When we told the waitress she immediately called the manager and he brought over a catering menu. He listened to our needs and did a great job recommending food and services.  We decided to try a variety of sides and made our decision. We choose two different types of meat: Beef Brisket and BBQ Chicken. Our sides were potato salad, cowboy beans and macaroni and cheese without the jalapeno. We decided on the macaroni and cheese because of the young people attending. The adults liked it just as much as the children! We also had the cornbread muffins which are amazing. They provided plates, silverware, hand wipes, napkins and extra BBQ sauce packets. We bought some rolls from a store in case some people wanted sandwiches. I do recommend you have your own napkins since the ones provided are small.  The server came and set up all the chaffing dishes and food. He came on time and was extremely professional. The food was fantastic. I highly recommend Famous Dave's for catering. It really made the wedding!",

This place came up on DoorDash instead of the BBQ place that we usually go to in Tempe--you know, the one on Baseline?  Well, no disrespect to that place on Baseline--we like it, but this place is quite a bit better.  I got a full rack of baby backs.  The ribs were absolutely delicious from first bite to last, as were the Wilbur Beans and cornbread.  My wife had the brisket, and was of exactly the same opinion--just fantastic.  We have found our new favorite BBQ joint.  We thought that our usual place would be hard to beat, but they did it, and won us over.

    "text": "I never write reviews for restaurants because I've worked in one so I get how it goes, but literally everything about this time around was just all bad.   DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE AT ALL UNLESS YOU WANNA WAIT 2 HOURS FOR FOOD AND RECEIVE SHITTY SERVICE!!!!!!!!  A couple months ago, I call to ask how long the wait is for 2 people so they tell me 30 minutes. I decided I will just order over the phone and just pick it up. They told me 15 minutes it will be ready so I come to the restaurant roughly 25 minutes after I placed my order. You know, I gave them a little extra time to have it ready and what not. I get there and they say it isn't ready and it will be 15 minutes so I go outside the door to just stand and wait since already 2 people were inside waiting. I come back after 15 minutes and they are just barely putting my food into the container.   Tonight, we went to have dinner around 540pm. We were greeted by 3 lovely people, they sat us down right away. Waited roughly 10 minutes for our waiter, she eventually comes takes our drink order then never comes back for 15 minutes. She comes back, gives our drinks and asks if we're ready so we order. 30 minutes after we ordered a couple walks in and gets seated behind us. We have the same waiter so after a while they order. They got their food 15 minutes after ordering. So we noticed, but didn't say anything. I mean how hard is it to toss a salad together and throw some brisket pieces on it and then to put some pulled pork on a sandwich bun. It honestly isn't that hard because we didn't even order anything complex to make. So the couple who came 30 minutes after us is already done with their food and our food is barely coming to us. We get the wrong order... my bf ordered the Georgia pork sandwich and he gets a brisket sandwich, but he's like whatever I'm not going to wait again for my right order I waited long enough so I'll just eat it. So he takes a bit and it is really salty so he didn't bother with it anymore. He was already pissed so I just said let's go, take the sandwich and our dog can eat it. We can get dinner somewhere else. Our waiter never came to check if we needed refills.. never even came to make sure our food was good. I ask the one of the hostess for a to-go box and my check so she comes back with the box and said she has to go find my waiter to get my check so that's fine. 20 minutes go by and she comes with it. I look at the check and instead of putting a pulled pork sandwich she puts brisket so that's how we ended up with the wrong order. We didn't have a big party of 10, there was only 2 of us.. she didn't bother writing our order down and just decided to memorize it but she fucked up on remembering what he had ordered. So you would think by now she knows we're ready in a couple minutes she will come back and get my card to swipe and whatever.. nope.... definitely did not come back. My bf is already out the door, furious at the service we received. I didn't wanna pay for our meal, not because I wanted to be rude and get free food. She never came back so I threw a $20 under my receipt and left. Literally, everything was so bad. When we came everyone around us was eating and probably more than half the restaurant was empty. I should have known from not to come back when I ordered my food to go and they said 15 minutes but it took longer.",

You get a lot to eat for a decent price. Most meals come with two sides, corn, and a cornbread muffin. And like any family chain restaurant you have to look very deep into its massive menu to find something healthy. The best part is the sauce. Famous Dave's leaves six types on the table. All of them are good. I personally love the Devil's Spit. It's perfectly spicy, but still very flavorful.   The staff was nice, but service was a little slow. In all fairness to the server, it was late and the kitchen was probably trying to clean up before we even got there.  Famous Daves is a place I'd go back to if some one wants to hit it up, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat there again.",

    "text": "I love this place! I'm a huge BBQ fan & this is the best BBQ that I've found in AZ (consistently great). I generally order the St. Louis Ribs, but I've tried just about everything on the menu... the only things that I didn't like aren't on the menu anymore (tri-tip & some citrus glazed ham). Occasionally, I stop by on my way home from work and get a pound of rib tips to go for $8.99.   For those that haven't been here, Famous Dave's is a sit-down restaurant that's very accommodating for large parties/families. It can get busy, but the service is usually pretty great & they get the food out to you quickly. It's a very rustic place & most of the chairs are wooden. The walls are decorated with funny signs, memorabilia & awards. It's definitely a casual dressed place... the waiters & waitresses wear T-Shits with sayings on them like \"Make sure the fingers you're licking are your own\". The portions are very large for the combo meals & the 4-bone St Louis Ribs with 2 sides plus corn on the cob & cornbread for $12.99 is more than enough to fill me.   If you're a vegetarian or vegan then this place isn't for you, but all you carnivores out there have found a place to call home.",

We took a table in the bar to keep an eye on the basketball game.  Our bartender/server was excellent - he was great with the kids, always on top of refills and seemed to know what we needed at every turn - best service we've had a in a long time! The  4 of us had the BBQ wings, the grilled chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and the brisket/georgia pork plate.  The kids LOVE the mac and cheese, it has a great kick to it.  The beans were also excellent.  I love the sweet BBQ sauce, each of us had our fave.  Can't wait for the next trip to Tempe to return.",

    "text": "So, while I'm not really a fan of chains or anything, I have to give Famous Dave's props for making what was turning out to be a birthday outing disaster a pretty damn good success!   The evening was supposed to start out with a trip to BW3s in Mesa (Buffalo Wild Wings for you non midwesterners). However, due to a special event we had to make a last minute decision to head to Famous Daves. At first we were told there would be an hour wait, which was sad. No more than 5 minutes after we seated ourselves at the bar though, our table was ready!! Success!!  Our server was pretty polite and I appreciated his razzing me for only having water (I had already downed 10 cocktails earlier that day) and was very good with taking our orders and the quirky ways we wanted to change things. Our food came out fast and prompt and everyone seemed very pleased with the change in venue.   Some things that put them above being a typical barbecue chain?  ** At one point someone at the table was telling a story and the pig decided to sit down at the fireplace behind her and imitate her for about 5 minutes before she noticed. It was HILAROUS. You creeped me out at first pig, but I heart you now.  ** Dynamite looking sparklers on free birthday treats??? ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We were all jealous of that dessert.   What started off as a tragedy was saved by Famous Daves. I was unable to eat my food that night as I wasn't feeling well, but I can tell you that it's pretty good reheated the next day. Yay for the mac and cheese side dish!!",

And Brak LOVES his corn.  The cornbread redeems however, it's excellent.  They also have great cole slaw and potato salad.  FD's registers a solid 4.75 stars on the Brak-o-meter, 1/4 star deducted for the crappy corn.",

    "text": "You can pig out here, and they won't squeal. How do I know? That's what their t-shirts say. But, if you don't want to feast on the pig, you have other options, too, like beef, chicken and fish.   The decor is fun, especially if you're among a hard-to-please crowd that is a mix of a) those who like to try new things and b) those who like the tried and True.   I'm told what makes Famous Dave's so famous is their BBQ sauce. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with any of their sauces, although it was fun for our waiter to explain each one, then draw the first letter of the sauce's name on a plate - easy for us to sample!   I flipped through their beer menu and was really happy to see they have Alaskan Amber Ale on tap, as well as Sam Adams. In the bottle, they have other varieties, like Red Stripe. I have to admit, for being a franchise, this place offers up a beer selection that's hard to beat (for your Average Joe destination).  The Alaskan Amber was the highlight of my day, for it was served ice cold in a chilled glass. Perfection! It went really well with the salmon I ordered, along with one of the best cornbread muffins I've had!   While I didn't finish my entree - I found the green beans to be too cold and bland and the salmon to be just \"meh\" - I did find delight in 3 things.   1. Alaskan Amber Ale on tap 2. Cornbread Muffin 2. Warm apple chutney on the side  Would I go back here? Yes, I definitely would, even if it's in Mesa RiverHell Marketplace.  Famous Dave's is a sure compromise for my family. I can drink the beer. They can eat the BBQ. My dad even said he'd give this place a 5-star rating.   So, in summary: This place is a family-pleaser, and I can't refuse any invitation to partake of the 3 aforementioned treats!",

It has all the annoying chain restaurant decor and lack of actual character (down to a poor employee dressed as a pig), but those negatives are offset by decent food and service.  The pulled pork is fine, though a little dry and sometimes a burned chunk can show up on your plate. The sauces are good, with several options on your table. The corn bread muffins are fine, but the corn on the cob is typically overcooked. They do have fantastic coleslaw and great beans, so if you pick your sides carefully, you can end up with a good meal.  I don't like the restaurant area (too many people, too much clutter on the walls, too noisy and too many wandering pig mascots), so I generally sit in the relative peace of the bar. It's a good option for a pre-movie dinner at Mesa Riverpoint.",

They have regular specials and even happy hour specials. The food is good, i haven't really had a bad thing on their menu. Its not your Texas bbq served on butcher paper but its good for AZ standards. I'd recommend the place for family or friends visiting the valley looking for a nice family restaurant, they have salads, wings, fish, chicken, ribs, brisket and a full bar. Im not sure i'd take someone who doesn't eat meat here. Go check it out i doubt you'll be disappointed. They even cater large parties and its ok to bring the kids to this place family friendly!!

Worth the trip for the smokey tasting Brisket and St Louis Ribs   Both the Chandler & San Village locations brisket tastes likes it steamed ... not smoked!  The St Louis Ribs are always so smokey tasting and tender, even beats Haps ribs on an off day ... and I love Haps BBQ ribs.   Famous Dave's is one of the better franchise's in the USA, very consistent and always a great experience. I always eat in the bar because thats how I roll, I  have never been disappointed at any location. However this particular Dave's deserves and extra star for doing a better job smoking the meats. While I live closer to San Tan, I usually drive the extra distance to get my fix here  Only downside to Dave's is the corporate selection of beer, local microbrew's would have be visiting more often.",

    "text": "Famous Daves Dinner was at the Famous Dave's located at 1011 N. Dobson Road, Mesa, Arizona. Start time was 7:00. We were a group of 13, mostly foodies.  Our group was seated outside. While we did have to wait until they had a table big enough for us all, they created one reasonably fast. Our waiter was cheerful and didn't mind all the separate bills. In fact he managed to joke about them without even crying. He also managed to get the drink orders right and even brought extras for some of the party. After giving us time to explore the large menu (perhaps just a bit too much time) a second waiter showed up to take the orders. He told us that the original waiter was having computer problems. We later found out that the computer problem was that he had about 16 other checks going at the same time. One has to wonder if the management might do with hiring a few more people.  I ordered the only appetizer at the table - Loaded BBQ chips. These were supposed to be homemade chips topped with bleu cheese dressing and crumbles and loaded with jalapeno bacon and tomato concassee. Unfortunately, the waiter brought out just plain chips first, and didn't return with the proper ones until the main course arrived. We passed the loaded chips around and everyone who ate them pronounced them excellent and something they would order again.  For my main course I ordered their rib tip and brisket combo platter. The combo platters figure out to be the best price/value on the menu as you not only get two main courses, but you also get two sides, cornbread, and  1/2 corn on the cob as well. The rib tips were excellent - meaty, nicely cooked, with a nice smoke flavor that didn't really need any other sauce (though I did try a little of each sauce on the table for comparison). Unfortunately, I can't give the same rave review to the brisket. In all my life I have never eaten a piece of brisket like what I was served tonight. I and every one else who had the brisket agreed that it was more like processed and formed meat then real brisket. It was very dense, had little flavor, and zero fat on it. True brisket BBQ tastes nothing like what they served. No amount of any of their sauces was able to improve the meat.  I enjoyed the coleslaw though one of my companions felt it was too heavy with mayo and another felt it was a bit peppery. (It is made with jalapeno in it which may have accounted for the peppery taste). I had the firecracker green beans which were flaccid, overcooked and totally lacking in flavor and/or color. The corn on the cob was water logged and tasted like it had been cooked for hours in a kettle of sugar water.  Companions all felt the corn was beyond any help in this world. One companion had the chicken and pronounced it to be excellent, but again, did not care for the brisket. Another companion pronounced the broccoli to be very good, not over cooked and still green. Companion sitting next to me had the hot wings. She felt that the wings were cooked well, but the sauce was a disappointment - she would have preferred a much spicier sauce. This same companion also ordered cheese fries (not on the regular menu) and pronounced them delicious when asked about them.  Several other companions had ribs - both spare ribs and short ribs and all agreed they were cooked to perfection. One of the companions had the mashed potatoes, and felt they were very good and would be ordered again. Yet another companion had the Ultimate Burger, and I must admit it was one of the biggest burgers I've ever seen. The burger was topped with pulled port, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno bacon. Even though it was cooked medium well, it was juicy and tasty. The burger was topped with a Beam and Cola sauce which seemed to make it even better. This was a True winner.  All of the wait staff were friendly and fun do deal with. When mistakes were made, which is almost a guarantee with a group of this size they were promptly corrected and often removed from the bill.  Desserts are a weak point of this restaurant. Then again, most people don't go to a BBQ house with the intention of eating dessert. We were the exception!  In the area of cleanliness, the place seemed reasonable clean and bug free. The restroom was reasonable clean and supplied. Of note though was a puddle of water on the floor of the main dining room that no one seem to want to clean up. All it would take is for a patron to slip and the management would not have a good night.  My overall rating - 3 stars our of 5 possible.  Would I eat there again - yes but I'd avoid the brisket, veggies and desserts",

    "text": "I've always heard good things about Famous Dave's, and even though I'm skeptical of chains, I was pleasantly surprised! The BBQ here is excellent; I had the brisket, which was tender and juicy. The real highlight for me were the different sauces. Each table has eight different sauces that you can add to your meat, and they really bring a whole new level of flavor out. My buddy got the full rack of ribs, and they were tasty a well. The meat comes right off the bone, and the sauces all compliment this dish as well. Minus one star for having weak drinks, but that is to be expected at a chain. A step above Lucille's BBQ at Tempe Marketplace. Check it out!",

I don't think I've ever left there without leftovers.  This weekend the boyfriend and I decided we were craving some good all-american pig out food so we headed over to FDs to get our glutton on. I ordered the brisket meal and he ordered the chicken wings. Each platter comes with two sides (and corn and cornbread - told you you'd be pigging out) so I chose the mac and cheese and the fries. They changed their mac and cheese recently and I have to admit I wasn't that thrilled with it. It used to be standard, old-school mac and cheese. Now it has corn and jalapenos in it. It was okay but I like the simple stuff with BBQ. The rest of the food was great. I tried the Dr. Pepper glaze on the brisket which was good, not too sweet.  We had a really nice server and the whole experience was just easy and fast - which is just what you want on a Friday night after a long, busy work week.  We left there stuffed, satisfied and with a box full of leftovers for later. We'll be back!",

    "text": "This is my dads favorite restaurant and we were celebrating his birthday today. We have dined at this location for many years. Today was such a bad experience from beginning to end.   My grandmother utilizes a walker and it was difficult to navigate thru the tables that were so close together. The young host didn't anticipate this and should have seen this and seated us somewhere more accessible for her.   We sat at the table and the lunch menu has dirty finger prints with tons of nasty BBQ sauce on it. When the manager came around I pointed it out to him and he laughed it off and took it from us.   I ordered a draft beer and it was flat, since our server was  lacking attentiveness, I walked to the bar myself and was given another one which was better.   Family ordered lunch portions ribs and I ordered a loaded baked potato. It was such a joke. $8 for a potato that was anything but loaded. I requested additional toppings as it hardly had anything in it. (see pics)   Other tables service was good, a plate with the dog drawn in it in BBQ sauce, a description of the different sauces, assistance with menu items. Non of this was received by our table. We couldn't even get a 2nd glass of water with our meals.   Finally as we are leaving, I'm so irritated at this point, we leave thru the take out door as it's closer for my grandmother and the rug is so soiled and disgusting.   This location needs a good scrubbing and a new set of eyes to make some necessary changes.",

    "text": "On July 1, 2019. at 4:40 pm I placed an order for 16 oz. of brisket which cost $18.99. I paid (with tax and tip) $22.57.  I have placed a similar order for brisket at this Famous Dave's before.  However this was the first time that I decided to weigh the brisket when I got home.  I weighed the brisket meat on a Kamenstein scale.  The meat weighed in at 12.2 oz.  I went back to Famous Dave's and spoke to the manger whose name was Marcos.  I brought in my scale and told him the brisket he just sold me weighed 12.2 oz.  I offered to have him weigh the meat on any scale, including mine.  He looked at the order and told me he could tell it was short.  I asked him for the name of the person responsible for weighing the meat. He said there were two people and he would not be able to determine who the individual was.  He replaced the order with what he said was 16 oz. of brisket.  I weighed the order when I got home and the brisket weighed 15.2 oz.  When I placed the piece of bread (on which they place the brisket) on the scale, the scale read 16.1 oz.  If this is the company's  policy to add the bread when weighing the meat for portion control, then Famous Dave is making a killing on bread.  I will not be visiting any Famous Dave's locations in the future.  I would suggest anyone visiting a Famous Dave's store to check how much meat comes with the order they choose, and then ask them to weigh it at the table.  If it is a take out, make them weigh the meat, without the bread, before accepting the order.  This may have been a one off bad experience for me but after the manager corrected the order and the order was still short without adding the bread makes me think it may be company policy. Paying $0.94 for a slice of bread seems expensive to me.",

I don't know what's going on here, but it's not good! Total chaos, poorly trained wait staff, ridiculous wait time and a $12 order of burnt ends, that consisted of 8 small pieces of burnt ends, 2 of which were total fat and 6 were dry. Negative experience overall.",

Our friend ordered a burger without a bun and the burger was like a hockey puck (although he ordered it medium). We flagged down the server, and then he got a replacement burger (no additional veggies on the side) once the rest of us were finished eating. The manager brought the burger out and told us to let him know if we needed anything else - no apology. And the burger was still on the ticket. Yikes!! My husband and I were splitting so we ordered an extra corn bread muffin and none of us at the table got our corn bread muffins, so after we saw that it was still on our ticket, we asked for them to go. It felt like we were pulling teeth. We paid for the burger, our other meals, the extra corn bread, and got the heck out of dodge.",

We miss the Famous Dave's that are throughout the South which are sooo much better than the ones out West, but this Famous Dave's is pretty good!  Restaurant~ great location, easy in and out access to the 202 Hwy.  This place is huge with plenty of room to accommodate loads of people and they are very \"kid friendly\".  The bar is a very nice area to eat and drink with again plenty of room and seating.  It's very clean and you will have a hay day playing \"eye spy\" with the kiddos.  Service~ better than what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  They are very quick to take your order and attentive to your drink needs.  They are not experts on what is on their menu, but then again it's a chain...  Food~ A-OK BBQ especially if your taking someone that is not a fan of BBQ.  Famous Dave's trys to cater to all BBQ fans by offering a six pack of sauces to choose from on your table with flavorings from Kansas City, Texas and the Carolina's.  Their BBQ is based on the sauce and not the actual BBQ cooking.  Their ribs, brisket, and pulled pork are cooked and taste more like pot roast to me rather than BBQ.  The meat is mushy and moist because of their sauce but it has pretty good flavor.  The Texas Manhandler and their Rib Tips are very popular and a recommend.   The fries are also very popular and tasty.  I would pass on the mac-n-cheese because it tasted blah even with the added jalapeno's and corn.    This is a great place to take the family and friends.  It's a fun place to eat, the service is real good and their food is not bad.  I hope to see you there!",

I have been wanting to try Famous Dave's for a while now, and finally got the chance to experience some wonderful food.  I am addicted to this place!  My friend Angie and I walked in on a Saturday night and were greeted immediately by the hostess.  I was also thrilled becuase there was no wait! We were seated immediately and offered drinks by the server.  Mind you, I have never been here before, so the menu was new to me.  We both took the time to review it, and the waitress also explained to us how to order.  They have meals for two with lots of food, entrees that are large as well, and also smaller sized meals (which I went with) that are more BBQ sandwiches of sorts, in case you don't feel like pigging out.  I really liked how they had big \"family meals\" with all the fixings.  Makes me think of a place back home in MI I used to eat at with my family when I was in college.  I went with the BBQ Brisket sandwich, and it was delicious!  It came with 1 side, and the roasted garlic potatoes.  Delicous!!!  YUMMY!  I devoured every morsel of it, and my friend liked her Brisket entree as well.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE how they have a HUGE selection of menu items! Chicken, brisket, beef, pork, everything a girl could dream up!  Service was marvelous, and food was worth every bite. I could never get sick of this place.",

    "text": "I've written about Famous Dave's BBQ before, but this one deals strictly with Food Allergies, celiac disease and the waitstaff at Daves. Tonight, my wife and I celebrated our 39th anniversary at Famous Dave's BBQ in Mesa Riverview shopping center on Dobson and the 202 Red Mountain freeway. We've been here before but I wanted to really check out their allergy awareness this time. After being seated, I asked the hostess to bring an allergen list or a gluten free menu. She brought a 4 page menu with Every Single Item listed according to what allergens might be present. Gluten, dairy, nuts, eggs, soy. You name, it was on the list.  I spoke to our waiter, Kaleb, and told him about our needs and he was very knowledgeable. Obviously, sandwiches were out but he mentioned that certain meals cane with bread or cornbread and the Wilbur beans were not safe. Now, my wife has tried the beans before but knowing that they are not considered gluten free really made the decision easy to ask for a substitute. Kaleb offered 2 or 3 options of sides that are considered safe so the cole slaw, corn and French fries really made the meal smazing. Do they have a dedicated kitchen? No. But having a knowledgeable staff and a menu that really lays it out for you can make dinner selection so much easier. So here's the deal. I get it when people with allergies ask for information about restaurants and foods. Every eating out experience requires a TON of studies and phone calls. But checking food reviews on YELP has helped in so many ways, that I wanted to give back to all the people that have researched and written about their challenges. No. Famous Dave's does not have a dedicated kitchen or prep space. Yes, their menu and staff are knowledgeable. At least the location We went to.  I hope my post helps. Have fun but be safe put there!",

I had the Rib Tip Platter and my wife had the Brisket Platter.  You get two sides and I chose corn and coleslaw. The corn wasn't soggy but the coleslaw was drowning. They both were good along with the tasty Rib tips and corn bread. I also had some pickles and pickle red onions. My wife finished her Brisket which looked and tasted great, especially with the 6 different BBQ sauces. Her side was fried brussel sprouts and BBQ beans.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. We will definitely be back",

There is so much going on in the restaurant that there's something new to look at every time.   The staff are all friendly and outgoing, when we went for dinner they were fairly busy but we were seated within 15 minutes. Our waiter was friendly and kept the conversation going.   My husband and I shared the three meat platter which was the perfect amount of food for us to share, there are so many options that there is something for everyone. Although the options are pricey, the food is delicious and the barbecue sauces are fantastic. The table, our booth, and the facility in general were fairly clean. Would recommend for date night or a night with the family!",

Also they can fit large groups. For my birthday I had 20 people and we fit with ease.",

    "text": "Don't judge me when I say this, but I am not a huge fan of BBQ food to start with. I am a fan of happy hour though! Even though they have trimmed down the happy hour offerings as of late, we are still able to eat for about $5 per person!   Let me break it down for you star by star...  First Star: as a general rule, I often give the first star out of goodwill (they are open, ready for business, greet me with a smile, friendly staff, etc.)  Second Star: I love that we can waltz in, seat ourselves at a clean bar, and get served right away. Bypassing the dining room wait always makes us feel like VIP's!  Third star: the BBQ is decent here and the happy hour prices are a steal. The family feast used to be our \"go-to\" when we visited with a group, but we haven't even thought of sitting in the main dining room or ordering an entire meal since we found out about their happy hour menu. $5 rib tips are where it's at. Comes with pickled red onions, sweet pickles, their southside sauce, and fries.  Just know, when you order the rib tips, it's about to get messy. There is no way to avoid getting sauce all over your hands and face! LOL Luckily, a roll of paper towels and little trays of hand wipes are at arms reach anywhere you sit along the bar. (The burnt ends used to be our favorite on the HH menu, but sadly, that has been removed from the list.  You can still order them for full price though, which is about $12.) Other than that, you can also get yourself a couple of ribs for HH according to the bartender, it just isn't listed on the menu anymore.   Fourth Star:  Country music videos, baseball games playing on the flat screens, libations, and cool bartenders. We look forward to the plate of kettle chips and BBQ sauce while we wait for our food too. We are easily pleased with this set up and will keep coming back for more!",

Of course when you walk in, you're greeted by the collection of trophies from BBQ competitions, and great hospitality of the hostess. Paul was our server, and he was awesome! Very friendly, and always around when we needed him. Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals was on, and he kept great conversation with us about the NBA this season (everyone in our party is a sports person, so this was great for us!). The food was pretty good, not as great as other locations I've been too. Meat was a little dry, but I'd still recommend giving this location on shot.",

    "text": "We were on the way to eat at Cracker Barrel when we ran into Famous Dave in the same shopping mall. We decided to do a turn around as the reviews about the Cracker Barrel weren't too enticing. We came about 3 PM on a Saturday and were surprised that the restaurant had quite a few diners in both the bar and restaurant area.  As soon as we sat down our waiter greeted us and gave us our menus. When I asked if they had smaller lunch special portions, I was pleasantly surprised to find out they did. So instead of usually ordering a $15.99 meal it went down to half that price for a two meat combo.  Having eaten at the Las Vegas Flamingo location for many years we were very familiar with the menu. I always ordered the 2 meat combo with the ribs and hot links and my husband the 2 meat combo with brisket and chicken.  When our food came out I was ready to dig in as I was famished but the food came out the way I don't like it and that was lukewarm. Food that isn't hot is a complete turn off.  Rather then complain and having to wait for them to reheat or make another order, I just picked at it and decided to take home most of the food to eat at another time. The taste of the food is consistent with the other locations we've eaten at, it is what it is. The only thing that needed major improvement was the coleslaw, it was so drippy and not at all fresh tasting. I took one fork full and immediately stopped eating it.   This restaurant is very nicely maintained, the bathrooms spotless and we got good service. Now we know where this location is we'll try to return and hope our $30 plus lunch meal comes out hot next time.",

This location was very loud and the food was slow. About 45 minutes from when we ordered until the food arrived. The food was about 3 stars. I like good char, which this definitely lacked. Flavor was mild and the meats were dry. I prefer when you don't need to add sauce, their's definately needed it to both add flavor and moisture. You may wonder why I gave them 4 stars... our service was excellent. I wish I could remember his name (I think it was Nate). He was prompt, friendly, and attentive,  even on a busy night. Always made sure we had what we needed and drinks were full. He was great with our kids, which for me, as a dad, is always a big deal. I would give him 5 stars, which is why I averaged the visit at 4.",

    "text": "Famous Dave's BBQ is about average. The meat isn't as tender or flavor filled as others in the Phoenix area but it is a more convenient option since there are multiple locations closer to where I live than say Bobby Q or Little Miss BBQ. This Mesa location is in the Riverview shopping area. The layout was spacious and we had no problem getting a table on a Friday night.   Every Famous Dave's will start you out with some complimentary chips and they'll squirt out some BBQ sauce on a plate for you to dip the chips with. Our server made a cute little piggy face design on ours which was a nice touch. I wanted a little variety in my meal so I had the 2 item combo surf and turf style with catfish fingers and pulled pork. Your combo will include 2 sides so I went with a healthier route, opting for steamed broccoli and green beans.   The food didn't take too long to make, probably just a few minutes and we were ready to dig in! The plate itself didn't look like a lot of meat to me but it did fill me up by the time I was done. The pulled pork was placed on a piece of white bread and drizzled with their Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauce. The catfish fingers were lightly battered and fried, and were tender but a bit too salty for me. The sides were decent, the veggies were both cooked as described.   Our server was Alex and he was great at getting drinks filled and making sure our meals were to our liking.  3.5/5",

The good was great! I had the brisket, wilbur beans, and fries with their devil spit sauce and I will definitely be back for the same meal! Other than the food, we were treated by a girl named Mack. Mack is the absolute best! She was very attentive, knowledgeable of the menu, and just a cute sweet lady all around. Keep Mack around,  and we will keep coming back!!!                                                    -Steve and Shari",

We have had barbecue beef and pork, buffalo wings, ribs...all of which were just average. My husband enjoys the chicken and rice soup. The Mac and Cheese is a little weird and I can't put my finger on why, but it's off. The service is usually very good - friendly and efficient. Each sever has always taken time to talk to our kids and treats them well - this goes along way with us. We don't live in the area anymore, but would potentially return if the mood was the right.",

However, I was very surprised that this location was way better in every way from the one I was used to.  Better food, better service, and better decor/ambiance.  I don't know how two places from the same franchise can be so different but it totally changed my opinion of the whole chain.  The food was very tasty, all of us at the table really liked our barbecue.  The server took the time to explain the different sauces to us and even drew a little design as she squirted them onto the plate.  She was on top of everything and very friendly even though the place was pretty packed.  This location has a real open feel to the dining room so it was a bit noisy but overall a fun, lively atmosphere.  I will definitely return and hope to try other locations as well.",

Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter.   Let me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight.   Only dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard.   On a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table.",

    "text": "I give this Famous Dave's 3 stars because the one nearest to where I live is better.  It had been a while since I'd visited a Famous Dave's.  My daughter and her family live in Mesa and I had encouraged them to give FD's a try since it wasn't too expensive.  They had a great experience at this one as first time visitors.  The manager  gave them a coupon for free chicken wings for their next visit plus a free bottle of BBQ sauce.  That, I must admit, was very nice as the one closest to me doesn't care if you are a first-timer or not.  I had forgotten just how much food ends up on your plate---way too much!   Yet one thing I do like about Famous Dave's --- they allow you to create your own combos.  I like the BBQ chicken and catfish combo.  At this Famous Dave's,  the BBQ chicken was moist but disappointingly was bland in flavor.  The catfish was spicy but dried out.  As always, the corn muffins, though on the sweet side, are moist and tasty.  The corn-on-the-cob was juicy and properly cooked.  I had  the mac and cheese.  It's good but I  think it could do without the corn in it.    My husband does like Wilbur's beans but he thinks the brisket is *meh*.  For chain BBQ, I guess Dave's isn't bad.  However, if you've  had BBQ in a highly rated non-chain place, Dave's will pale in comparison.  Still...service tends to be good, attentive and friendly.",

I moved here (AZ) from Texas 13 years ago and have yet to find a BBQ joint, that I'm thrilled with. (Joe's in Gilbert comes closest so far)  I ordered the St Louis Style Spareribs and the \"Texas\" beef brisket. The ribs were passable but a little dry and lacking smoke flavor. The brisket was a joke !!..Not only did it lack flavor, it was sliced way too thick was also very dry and tough. It was like eating a plank of wood off my sundeck !!  I should have left when I tasted the cornbread muffins..they were dry and horribly too sweet..even underneath the disgusting honey topping. I would give this place a zero (0..goose egg..nada) but a one is as low as yelp will permit..I believe.  BTW..The service was excellent. My waitress was great..She can't help it if the food sux..",

Every bite was juicy, succulent and full of flavor. Got the Cole slaw as a side...it was cold, crunchy and outstanding as well. I left with a very full stomach, and a smile on my face. Service was excellent and very fast. The server told me that they mix a little pork in with the beef, to make that burger. All in all, a clear 5 star performance. Rarely moved enough to write a review on a burger, but this one clearly deserved it, hands down. A rare treat today in a world of food, that seems to hover around average. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by my meal, but was moved enough to write this. Amazed this place wasn't packed, but I did go in at 4pm, so probably beat the rush.

I think this is pretty shady at least and dishonest at its worst.  Feels like the old hair and switch.   If they are going to put such restrictions on the cards, they should say so up front.

We always order the family platter, which is a massive amount of food! Their pork, brisket and ribs are the best! The cornbread is also great.  For around $70, you can feed 6 people and still have food to take home! The BBQ sauces are also tasty with the chips they bring out before the food. I like the sweet and tangy sauce the best.   The best part about Dave's BBQ is that they do FREE dinners for anyone named David or Dave on their anniversary. That's been a benefit for me since my dad is David and a good friend is Dave. Only thing I've ever had here that I wouldn't order again is the chocolate brownie dessert. The flavor of the brownie was off and I didn't enjoy it.  Good food, fun vibe and friendly staff here.

We normally order the family meal which is served in a round metal garbage can lid which at first seems off-putting but we have gotten used to it. My favorite is the sweet tea (you can't find that in most restaurants in our area), the cornbread & the pulled pork. My least favorite is the ribs.  They include fresh made potato chips before your meal. They had an email club which actually sends you coupons (unlike some others I have joined like Bucca de Beppo & Cracker Barrel) as well as a birthday coupon. Don't forget to ask for butter if you like it with your cornbread (which is sweet & moist) or corn on the cob. It is often busy & loud so keep that in mind when you are planning your dining experience.",

My brothers and family decided to take my dad to this restaurant to have a celebration for Fathers Day. The bad service started since we got our table. We asked for a drink menu that was never provided until 1/2 hour later. Some of the drinks (sodas and water) arrived and they were all mixed. The server offered some chips to one of the table (we had 2 tables) and told us that he was going to bring more for the other table, he never did. Finally we had ordered our food and some appetizers. The main dish showed up and appetizers never did until later, the manager apologized and informed us that he was going to take care of a couple desserts. We started eating and we requested extra plates to a different server, he brought 2 plates. We requested more to a different server and no one took care of us. At time We did not see our server for 20minutes. My wife had to walked to the kitchen to asked for plates! It's no over yet, finally our server showed up, we asked for a refilled on our drinks because he never offered, minutes later he brought the drinks mixed up again! Dessert time, we ordered 2 and some extra plates. The desserts showed up and no extra plates again! My mom had to cleaned up a couple plated so we can enjoy and don't get upset because the worst service ever. My brother called the manager and informed him about the bad service and he told us that he is going to talked to the server. When we got our bill we got charged for one dessert, I guess the manager forget what he mentioned earlier. By that time we got tired of dealing with the service and paid for the bill.   I strongly not recommend this placed!",

    "text": "This is a very hard review to write for one simple reason - When I moved to Arizona from northern Indiana I really didn't know what good BBQ was.  I didn't even know the difference between BBQ'ing and grilling.  My first visit to Dave's I thought, \"Wow, this IS real BBQ.\"  Over the years I have learned the difference, the different types and have done much research on the topic.  I have explored the difference between using sauce and dry rubs, different woods used, about everything you could imagine.  Now, several years later, I have my own smoke pit in my backyard, I know I prefer dry rubs over sauce, Texas over Carolina sauce and the list goes on.  After this last visit (only reason we went is because it was close to the BassPro Shop) I realized that Dave's is not what I thought it was in the beginning.  Don't get me wrong the bartender we had was awesome.  He was funny, sarcastic and super attentive.  I would give him alone 5 stars.  The food, I just like it the way I cook it and not the way it is done here.  I may have inadvertently turned into a BBQ snob....ooops!",

I was spoiled to a bit of honey to drizzle over the top! Yum! Our party of 6 ordered the feast for 4-6 people. I enjoyed everything! I normally like my corn on the cob a bit more crunchy, but I overlooked that because the corn was very sweet.   Our server was great and even gave us an introduction to all the sauces while drawing the infamous 'pig' face on a platter with the sauces. She was attentive and engaging! So great to have such a friendly server. Everything came out quick and looked, smelled, and tasted amazing.  The atmosphere was fun, upbeat, and seemed to center around family. Just a great vibe.  We had a blast and loved every bite of food!  Thank you to everyone there who made this experience worth while!",

They used to always be fresh, we'll seasoned with the rub, tender, and perfectly cooked. The last few times they have been burnt, chewy, dry, underseasoned and just not up to par with what I've always gotten & loved at Dave's. The only problem I used to have was EVERY SINGLE TIME if I ordered a side of ranch for my fries, it wouldn't come out w the meal and it would take a long time for someone to ask if everything was OK so I could request it again. But... That was minor and even became kind of a joke to me bc I just knew to expect it every time.   Last night we got take out from there for the first time. We usually dine in but my boyfriend picked it up & brought it over. I ordered my usual naked ribs and decided to go with sides of corn & broccoli. I felt like some nice fresh veggies would be good for me. The broccoli was completely inedible. It was dry and about 90% brown and wilty. I can't even believe they would send something like that out to a customer. If I didnt live so far away I certainly would've taken it back.   This was just another bad experience in a long line of them for me. Sad to say bc it used to be one of my FAVORITE places to eat,  but I'll be looking for a new BBQ joint.",

Somehow I've lived under a rock, and never visited a Famous Daves before. I know they are a chain, so I had higher than usual expectations for the food being consistent.   I ordered the Georgia Chopped Pork, and my father had the spare ribs.  We ordered Baked Beans. Potato Salad, and mac and Cheese for sides and shared.   The Pork was good. It was a little dry, but I drowned it in multiple sauces, and it tasted good. The potato salad was wonderful, just the right amount of flavor without being over powering. Same with the beans, There were sizable chunks of meat mixed in with the beans and it was De-lish.   The Mac and Cheese was awful, and that's saying something because I hardly meet anything with cheese I haven't loved. No only was it \"spicy\" with Jalapenos (which I never felt like had a place in Mac and Cheese) but the flavor was missing something. Neither myself, nor my father could place WHAT it was missing, but we left it.   The service was great, even with our server with a 12 top and 6 top (that we could see) in addition to us. Very friendly, made great recommendations, and kept our drinks topped off.   I'm sure I will go back, since it's so close to him, but it is a bit generic for BBQ. I think I prefer Lucilles to Daves... and that is also quite close.",

I love the unique decor, with all the silly relics and even the plaid picnic table cover during lunch hours!  The food is amazing, extremely generous with proportions and tasty. I thought it was a great idea to have a slice of Texas toast under the BBQ! The sauces are also great, though I miss \"Brother Jimmy's BBQ\" in NYC, Famous Dave's is close enough!    Attached are the pictures of our feasts, we've only been there 2x since moving to AZ in 6 weeks!  But as you may see in my pics, is a great variety with big portion for the price.  Plus, when the kitchen sent the wrong brisquet, the manager brought us the right one really fast and let us keep the other one!  The drinks are great, very yummy may I say.

Anyway, Brennan was gracious and proceeded to take great care of us with a happy attitude and quick response.

The lunches come with 1 side and a cornbread muffin. The cornbread is delicious.   They have 5 or 6 different sauce options on the table, so everyone can get whatever flavor BBQ they like most. I go for the Sweet Zesty sauce. By the end of the meal we are usually so full we skip out on dessert, but the options are always enticing!

Sometimes the food takes a little longer but it always tastes great and is worth the wait.  Chris has become our new favorite bartender.  His NY accent is fun and he's a good sport.  Love all the bartenders there, definitely recommend sitting in the bar and ordering some happy hour items.  Dave's is one of the few places still rocking a happy hour these days!",

Considering that day was a busy night we received nothing but great quality meal and services. Our food was very authentic and loaded with flavors. Loved the spare ribs, endless cups of cold ice tea,corn bread, and tried out the chicken wings for the first time they were amazing.   Looking forward to visiting again",

Never filled my water once. Never gave any of us at our table a refill. Tried to get her attention several times and she acted like she didn't see us. The only time she acted happy was when she took our money $$ and as we walked out so she could fill another table.",

I have to say I was impressed by this! I have seen places fail when coming having to sever a big party.  I also have to give big props to my server Miriam, on this evening I was the pushy patron, I told her that I needed to be out by 8pm and that didn't even phase her, she got my order done, gave me the check and had me done before 7:30pm. Miriam was very pleasant and came with a smile! She was part of the super team that served our party! Thank you Miriam!  I ordered the southside rib tips, came with fries and jalapeno pickled red onions and hell fire pickles,  the hell fire pickles were pickles that packed heat, love it! Reminded me of the spicy dill pickles, I didn't really try the red onions, not because I don't like onions, but I had a date to go run off to and didn't want to reek of onions, haha  The food, the service, the place was great! I do see myself coming back and enjoying some more good ole bbq!",

The service was a little slow but all in all a little better then normal. I know what I'm getting when I come here, so will be back when in the mood and it's on the way to where I'm headed, would not drive out of the way for the place.",

I have no clue why there are so many or why they are relevant at all, but they're great! I wasn't able to take good pictures on account of how busy the restroom always was.   The restroom is good for a restaurant, it's clean, doesn't smell bad, and has a baby changing station. But the random shaving art is amazing!",

If you do that, you'll get the same amazing food and a much better price, or dare I say it, \"for cheap\"?  The inside of the restaurant has a bunch of junk hanging everywhere, but that's their shtick, and I dig it. The outdoor patio is nice if you have little ones as it's completely enclosed. The service was good and our waitress went above and beyond. I'll definitely be returning.",

Yesterday my wife and I had lunch here and I splurged on the individual feast for $19.99 which included pulled pork, 3 ribs and barbecue chicken with wilbur beans, corn, slaw and a corn muffin.  It filled me up and I brought the chicken home with me.  My wife had a 2-meat lunch special and brought half her meal home also.  What I like most about Famous Dave's is the 5 different varieties of barbecue sauces.  Most barbecue places have 1 sauce.  I really like to try the different types on different parts of my meal.",
