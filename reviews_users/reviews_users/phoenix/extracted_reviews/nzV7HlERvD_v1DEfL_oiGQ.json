My three girlfriends and I went there for lunch and had a great time. Even introduced two of them to Pita Jungle and they loved the food.  BUT our waiter was rather sneaky. Two of us paid for our meal on card and the other two put in cash...and needed change. Our waiter rather boldly said \"all set! Thanks\" and then promptly disappeared. Getting a rather hefty 35% tip. I mean he was a pretty good waiter, but by no means deserved a 35% tip! Yikes! I hope he had a happy night out at the bar that night.  Oh and yes, the parking at this location is atrocious.",

However, they have lost me as a customer because the service has been getting progressively worse. I placed an internet order (as I almost always do) but today no one seemed to know how that works. Clearly, they are not training their staff because it took four people to figure it out. The order should have been ready by 4:15 but I had to wait another twenty before they brought my food. They made no apologies but stopped by several times and said it would be \"another two minutes.\" I asked for no onions on the broiled chicken salad. When I got home and took it out of the bag there were so many onions on it I could barely see anything else. Today was the last time I will ever go to this location. Just wish I had said something while I was there.",

    "text": "\"Let's meet at the Chandler Pita Jungle!\" texts fiddle r dee. \"What's it near? Like the mall proper?\" I text back. \"Dobson and Ray!\" she exclaims (she's easily excitable it's pretty cute the first hundred thousand times but after that it's like wha'ev's :p) \"What the hell!?! That's not near the mall!!!\" I shout in my mind. I had no idea that there was anything else in Chandler besides that obnoxious mall, an In-n-Out Burger, and were all the house wives whose husbands aren't wealthy enough to give them houses in Scottsdale lived. I couldn't believe it. Amazing.   So I park the chrome trimmed tank and burst through the doors looking for the fiddle r and a bunch of friggin' ducks that she has been eyeballing for lunch. She urged me several times in class via text to hurry because raw duck gives her indigestion and she didn't think the proprietors would look favorably upon her preparing her own lunch on the patio (unlike the Monastery). She was ravenous and there's a fierceness that comes out when she gets that way. It would be scary if it didn't makes me giggle. Anywhodunnit, yah, a friggin' patio and with friggin' ducks! I love friggin' ducks! Oh yah, around noon this place is filled with soccer moms mostly minus their spawn but a couple of the moms stole them away from their nannies long enough to show the brats off to the other soccer moms. I imagine the conversations go a little like this, \"Look how much more better and how much more pretty my baby, I forget its name, is than your baby that you forgot its name is.\" \"oh yah, but at least my husband, I forget his name, bought me better tits than your husband, you forget his name, did.\" and then they go runnin' for the shelter of their mothers' little helper... I think this is why I wasn't really noticed when I first walked in and asked about the ducks I look nothing like these people, my soul had not been crushed by the fact that I sold my dreams for a cookie cutter cardboard existence (mostly because I sold my soul in 4th grade, a long time ago).  I finally found fiddle r at her table on the patio and exchanged glares I sat to wait another ten minutes until someone asked us if we needed help. Luckily for the staff the conversation was fairly good otherwise the fork that Ms. fiddle r was fiddling (she's an amazing fiddler) with would have ended up in someone's temple a couple of times.  When we finally received a bit of wait attention nothing on the menu jumped out at me. I was thinking lamb or pork gyro. Sad face for Howard, beef gyro for me. Fiddle r ordered the Lavosh Shwarma wrap that read like it might be the good side of yummy but I didn't want to order the same thing because I wanted to be different.  I've been to one other Pita Jungle (across from MCC in Mesa on Southern) three times in total but have never been overly impressed by them but seemed fairly competent. This one fell inline with it's sister store even with the strange beef in the gyro that I think they try to make look like lamb but in rectangular slices. WHERE IS THE FRIGGIN' LAMB!?! The exception as far as the food is concerned was the Blue Corn Nachos that fiddle r ordered for us. Someone in the kitchen dumped a bucket of goodness onto a plate and slathered it with cheesy gooey-ness! Yum! Fiddle r and I enjoyed it muchly as did the ducks. And actually ducks like a lot of things I wouldn't have thought like tomatoes, beans, beef, and chicken. I wished they served duck because that would have been hilarious.  What made this place fun was not the food (2.25-2.5 stars - I changed my mind.) and definitely not the service we received (2 stars, I wasn't even asked if I wanted another beer) it was the shaded friggin' patio located on the edge of a man-made lake-ish type water feature and the friggin' ducks and as always the friggin' company.",

But unfornately, this Chandler location does not live up to the same quality standards as the Tempe location!  A Lavosh pizza here is simply disappointing in comparison.  In fact, almost everything here is disappointing and many times served cold.  My first experience was so bad, I almost didn't want to try the Tempe location but I am glad I did.  It is really sad because this is a more convenient location for my wife and I but we will never come here because it is not good.  Do yourself a favor and go to their Tempe location on Apache and you'll see exactly what we mean.  They are not even the same restaurant in terms of food quality, consistency, and service!  Anyone who comes here and says the food is good has surely not been to the Tempe location!",

    "text": "Pita Jungle Chandler location...What is going on? I have frequented this location for the last few years and to be quite honest I have never been 100% satisfied because it is always hit and miss. Either you get crappy service and good food or crappy food and good service.   In this neck of the woods you really don't have a neighborhood hangout that offers healthy fair. So it is the GO to place when you want to stay close to home and don't want the big chain restaurants nearby. Over the years I have come to order the same thing because it was simple and easy. The chicken and hummus plate with a greek salad is my usual. About 2 months ago my roomie and I went in and we switched it up a bit and got the salmon and hummus with the greek salad. The salad had wilted greens. I am not talking about one or two but practically the whole salad. Well I finally flagged down my waitress whom I show the lettuce to and ask for a new salad. Well she has this look on her face like....what's wrong with that lettuce? She brings a new salad with the same crappy lettuce. She did not even ask if this particular salad was OK. This makes no sense for a restaurant that touts \"fresh and healthy\" in their mantra to serve this type of produce. Not to mention it is right next to Sprouts and Whole Foods is down the street. Hello Pita Jungle...if your produce stinks go buy fresh produce.  Anyway I emailed the store and got a prompt reply back from the manager. She stated that they have been having some issues with the line, thanked me for my email and sent me a $25 gift card. I have to say I was very impressed. Especially since I really did not want to write a bad review because this was an easy fix. As for the crappy service I could live with it on occasion. I know good help is hard to find in the restaurant business.  So tonight I decided to get my usual with my gift card. First off I see they have online ordering, which by the way did not work. So I call. I must have called 5 times before someone answered the phone and the phone rang for well over a minute once. I thought maybe they were closed on Mondays. Finally someone picks up and takes my order.  I get there a few minutes later and the place is jumping but not crazy crowded. However, the staff is always running around crazy but it looks like they are getting things done. I am waiting to get my order and 3 people asked if I was being helped. Great Service btw. But alas always hit or miss. My food comes out a few minutes later and I am off.   I get home anxious to see if my greek salad got an upgrade to better lettuce. Lets just say it was the same as my previous visit. I had half the nerve to take a pic to show but it really does not matter. I don't feel like wasting anymore time or energy on this place. To top off the bad lettuce the pita was stone cold. You never get cold pita when you dine-in but my pita was hard as a rock. That was the final straw. The thing is they have so much potential at this location. But they just can't get it right.  I will no longer frequent this Pita Jungle. There might be a hope for the other locations but as far as Chandler goes spare yourself the game of Russian Roulette.",

If you're flexible (at all), stay away from the traditional lunch time (12-2) as parking is a bear!   Now - the food. Really good food with good prices. Chicken schwarma is awesome and the red bell pepper hummus is too! I call it a \"carnival of flavor\" ... I'm not sure it was really that good or if I was really that hungry - but everything tasted incredible ;)   Nice outside patio seating next to the lake comes complete with free entertainment - ducks.   Family friendly place that's also good for a quick lunch with a friend/co-worker or two. Commissioned art pieces decorate the place - so if you're an aspiring artist - this might be a good place for you, as well.   Would I return? Absolutely!",

However, the service is very spotty and hit and miss. Last night, we were delighted with our server. But when we mentioned that the extremely loud noise from the vacuum was bothering us (to the point where a dinner conversation was not possible), he sent the kitchen manager over who was extremely rude. \"Do you have a problem?\", the kitchen manager asked, and when we kindly requested the noise be stopped, he flat out refused, acting as if our request was somehow outlandish.  If that's how Pita Jungle values its customers, I don't think I want to come here anymore. Actually, I was considering it for a party of 10 out-of-town guests tonight and will be going elsewhere. Can't risk vacuums next to my dinner table.",

    "text": "I have been to two pita jungle locations. This one is probably the worse of the two. I have eaten in this establishment, ordered online, called for a to go orders, and ordered to go at the location itself. First I will start with the food.   Food: I actually really like the food at Pita Jungle. Granted, I have only had 3 or so items off of the menu. The entree I get the most often is the Hummus and Tabbouleh salad with pita. I love their hummus. It is so creamy with the right amount of flavor. I always get a large order so I can have some for lunch the next day. The tabbouleh is ok. I have not had any other tabbouleh salad to compare it to, but usually I have to add my own flavorings because its pretty bland. Its parsley with cracked wheat, some tomatoes and onions. I usually squeeze some lemon juice on it, and then add the garlic and oil from my garlic mushrooms that I order (which I love. Garlic and mushrooms. Honestly, what's not to love?) as well to give it some extra flavor. If they did that on their own it would be great. Its also pretty watery so I have had to ask for it on the side, or extra dry. But this should be done automatically, because who wants watery tabbouleh sitting on top of hummus, which then also gets watery? Nobody! I have also had the falafel pita, which is ok. Sometimes the falafel balls have been really good, other times overcooked and almost burned. Its hit or miss. I have also had the 1000 beans. Pretty good. I have had the trio of hummus before but I prefer the original flavor. The roasted red pepper just didn't taste very good, and the jalapeno wasn't spicy at all.   Eating in the restaurant: We have had a few different waiters. Usually when we have the guys they are more friendly. But the women that work here are rude and cold. We haven't had a problem with any of our food eating in the restaurant. But we have had to wait for long periods of time for our waiters to come around once in awhile. Even when it is not busy in here. Everyone here is apparently allowed to dress as they please. Last night I was in here and some girls bra was hanging out of her shirt. I am sorry, but nobody wants to see that when they are eating dinner. No matter how cute you think you look. Its trashy. They seriously need some sort of dress code in these places, even if its just jeans and a t-shirt that covers your boobs.   Ordering online: There have been problems with this to the point I don't do it anymore. Some items they offer in the restaurant are missing from the options to choose from online. I have ordered online, gone to the store to pick up, and my order was missing. Then the girl who takes to go orders, called every single other pita jungle location in Arizona to find my order. Seriously? Just place a new order. There have also been times where I order something, and it didn't show up on my order, so I end up waiting around an extra 10 minutes because they have to make it after all of my other food has already been finished. I would say skip ordering online.   Call in orders and ordering at the restaurant: The girl who is in charge of to go orders is extremely rude and snobby. She never says hello when we walk into the store. Just stares at us until we order. Uncomfortable. And then when we do order, she seems like its such a labor intensive job when we order 4 things. Get a grip girl. I have also ordered my tabbouleh on the side before and then I never got it, even though I paid for it. I didn't realize this until I was at home already and was pissed but not enough to go back and let my food get cold over a salad. I also have paid for pitas I have not received. Just make sure if you order to go, check your bag of food before you leave to make sure you have gotten everything you have paid for. They must tie their bags in a knot for this reason, they want to gip you and not have you check. I learned my lesson. I check every time now.   I like the food (hummus) enough at Pita Jungle to keep coming back, but I should probably look for a more friendly location to frequent. This one just doesn't vibe well with me. So I will give this place 2 stars for the food. But 0 stars for everything else.",

The tapas - hummus trio, dolmades, Kafta slider and falafel were SO good, it was noticeably better than the other locations, and reminded me of the original Pita Jungle in Tempe.  Found out this one is the 2nd Pita Jungle location opened and has been around a long time. They've got something right, it's worth the stop here!",

    "text": "I truly enjoy every visit to Pita Jungle. I get excited knowing it'll be exceptionally good, and good for me. The hummus with grilled chicken is enough for two people. Skip the regular, boring hummus and go with half roasted bell pepper, half cilantro jalapeno for a winning combination under $10 bucks. Throw in an extra pita and you've got a full lunch or dinner packed with mouth watering flavor and tons of protein for all you diet/fitness fans.   It's been months since I've strayed from my beloved hummus, but I can't fail to mention noteworthy selections on the menu. The roasted chicken shawarma pita is your standard gyro. Tender meat and fresh veggies. *Ask for extra tzatziki sauce*  Fancy stepping out of your carnivorous comfort zone? The Chipotle Black Bean Burger will satisfy your need for spices (not heat), and double down on an intricate blend of healthy ingredients. Homemade black beans are the building blocks of the patty, tossed with onions, garlic, bell peppers, oats, cranberries, you get the picture! Served up with chipotle hummus and potatoes. My recommendation for nervous new vegetarians who can't fathom giving up the beef.",

However, this last visit we ordered the cauliflower in tahini sauce and the falafel salad.  We've ordered it many times.  Even in the Gilbert Pita Jungle.  Well the cauliflower wasn't cooked enough, the dish wasn't even hot.  The falafel salad came with no salad dressing. When we told our waitress, Rachel that it didn't have any lemon vinaigrette, she said it doesn't come with lemon vinaigrette.  If you look at the menu, it specifically  states it has lemon vinaigrette on it!  This restaurant is too loud, so we typically eat outside. They got new chairs and they are very uncomfortable. We will eat at the Gilbert Pita Jungle in the future as the chairs are comfortable, you can talk to each other, the cauliflower comes out piping hot and the salad has lots of dressing on it!",

    "text": "This is probably the second time I've been to this place. I came here with all my co- workers for a team lunch. We had a big group of 12 people. So we had a reservation and we were sitting outside. It was really nice especially with about 6 ceiling fans going which was great. The inside was decorated very hip. I would say the inside was medium size with lots of tables and they were so busy at lunch. Very noisy with a lot of happy people enjoying their lunch.   I had the Philly Chicken Pita. It had grilled chicken with grilled peppers and onions over melted cheese. It was alright. Not great. The chicken had some taste but not a lot. It was a big pita and enough to fill you up but not stuff you. So I would say its a good size. You can also get sides with it but I didn't.   A lot of people I saw ordered their salads which were huge. It looked really good and I think next time I will try one of their salads.   So the service was exceptional especially with such a large group and the place being very busy with a waiting line. We were greeted right away after we were seated and got our drink order in. Drinks were at our table right away. They were always checking on our glasses and made sure our glasses were always filled. Very impressive with such a busy place. The food took a little longer especially since we had a pretty big party but they brought out the food in a decent amount of time.   Overall, service was great and comfortable with okay food. I'm thinking the food is okay because of what I ordered and will be smarter next time.",

The food is excellent.. always really flavorful. Never have had a bad meal here. Food comes out fast and is very reasonably priced. My personal favorites: -Garlic dip -Hummus trio -Any of the pizzas  -Lavosh shawarma -Berry tea -Really the entire menu  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is great. Really laid back with eclectic decor. You'll notice each location features a large mirror and rotating artwork display, which is pretty cool.   Highly recommend!!!",

I did call the restaurant and he did refund me the money for just the salad and not the delivery fee. He said I would have to place another order to have it delivered again along with the fee. So you mess up my food and I again have to pay 3.99 to send a driver out to deliver and wait another 30-45 min due to something the restaurant messed up . NO THANKS",

This place is Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Vegan friendly so really you can find something for everyone at this place. In addition, there is outdoor sitting by the lake, which is just perfect when the weather cools down.  Just don't mind the ducks. ;)  The food here is really good and fresh. This evening I'm having the Couscous salad with a Passion Fruit iced tea, but I've also had many of the other menu items throughout my several visits to this spot. I can usually never finish the salads since they are so huge, but they taste just as good the next day. The Hummus is a must, and any kind will do they're all really good. If you're watching carbs, you can order it with cucumber slices instead of a pita which is fantastic and very refreshing on a warm day.   All in all, I really like this place and the service is great. Not too slow, but not too rushed either. This is one of my go-to places when I really crave something super healthy.",

It took me a good 15 minutes of driving around. Not exaggerating.   Next, I was sat right away. Awsome! But it took 8 minutes to be acknowledged  by someone. Normally I wouldn't  really care,  but I was super hungry and pregnant, so it bothered me.   She finally comes back five minutes later with my water, but my the starter I ordered ended coming out with our entrees, which was a good 30 additional  minutes later.   My server already hade two other tables, and then got sat with us and another couple at once. She was nice, hence the two stars, but management should think about having the place better staffed to accommodate guest.",

We were seated promptly and then no one came to even take a drink order for almost 10 minutes.  My daughter sat happily coloring.  One thing about this location that I noticed.....the tables seem to be right on top of one another.  The women sitting next to us looked irrated that a child was now sharing her seat.  The guys on the other side of us were using bad language in their conversation. I don't mind being seated close to others but others mind when you bring a child into the mix.  In my opinion we should have been seated at a table that was not so close to others or close to the other children that were there.  After 10 minutes our server finally showed and apologized for the wait.  He took our order and the food arrived fairly quickly.    My daughter loves the pasta here and I had the Chicken Del Sol.  This is like a southwest chicken stew and it was very good.  Flavorful and filling.  Again the ice tea here is the best!  I could drink a gallon of it.   And our server was kind enough to give me a to go cup with a refill and he refilled my daughter lemonade as well.    This location could use some work, in my opinon.  The front doors look very worn and the interior here needs some sprucing up.  And maybe some reaargement of the tables too.",

This fact combined with the fact that its not a lot of food for your money, aka bad value makes it lose a few points in my book.  The service is good, the staff is very friendly and its worth a visit, who knows you might like it? If you can't make it to Haji Baba in Tempe, or Baiz Market in Phoenix, then I suppose you can check this place out. Don't expect to be wowed too much. I pretty much never crave the food here, and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more. Haji Baba and Baiz probably cannot realistically accommodate large parties.",

The one thing I was disappointed with is that for the price, my pizza was really small, and for the same price, my friend got this huge pita. The pizza was about the size of a small microwaveable one. Usually I can never finish a meal when I go out to dinner, but here, I very quickly finished the whole thing.",

So when my co-wkr wanted to go, I quietly groaned.  But it wasn't bad, not at all.  I had the seared yellow tuna over salad, fish was a bit flavorless but the salad w/ sesame dressing was actually surprisingly tasty.  My friend ordered the Carribean salad, think basically HUGE fruit bowl for $10.  Order this if you're too lazy to chop a variety of fruit and eat that for breakfast for a few days in a row.  I kid you not.",

    "text": "I chose to have a happy hour snack here a couple of days ago. It had been a while since I was a patron here, and some hummus sounded amazing at the time. And, as always, the hummus (all 3) was excellent. I opted to sit on the patio overlooking the lake that sits just across a small patch of grass and a concrete pathway. \"How did this pond get here?\" I thought for just a moment...then decided I didn't care because my black bean burger was being brought out to me.  The service is almost always amazing. The guest ducks, unfortunately, have been trained by those with lesser wills to beg table-side for some scraps from your plate, and subsequently crap all over the dining area floor. All I hear from the white duck is 'quack quack!', which I assume in duckinese means 'more hummus', but I can't be too sure. I don't even know Spanish.   Other than the pandering ducks, my experience here was very good again. Looking forward to the next visit!",

    "text": "Went to Pita Jungle last night for an early dinner. The restaurant was not half-filled, and the server was great in the beginning with taking our orders, but got progressively worse as the meal went on. He made up for it at the end with bringing to go-drinks, but didnt stop by during the meal for refills.  The food we ordered was very good with good prices.  My wife and I ordered the tapas which worked out well. We had the hummus trio, garlic dip, falafel, mozzarella and tomato, and pita with olive oil and thyme that may have been the highlight. My daughter had the mahi and she enjoyed it, but not as good as salmon. My son had a mac and cheese kids meal that had great variety, comes with fruits, vegetables and a protein. He opted for the mashed potatoes which were good.  We had he turtle cheesecake for dessert which may have been frozen, but tasted yummy.  We will be back after not having gone for years. Hope the service picks up a little though.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why I continue to bother with Pita Jungle. This is a different location, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix. I happened to be in the area so I figured \"why not?\" It's the fondness I have for their food - it goes way back to when they were a little indie shop near ASU. Their baba is just one of the most unbelievable things I have ever tried in my life and I always feel like I've had something healthy and good for me, no matter what I get.   When I first walk in, I'm kind of struck by how empty the place is here at high noon. I recall having to fight for space at this place. Not this time. Of course, it is the weekend, so perhaps they do most of their business during the week. Or perhaps people are tiring of the nonexistent service. I am seated quickly, which is as it should be, because the place is EMPTY. There are literally maybe three or four parties in the whole building including the back porch. I count what appears to be about nine employees moving about in various capacities, none of whom look at me. The hostess who seated me vanishes, not so much as bringing me a glass of water. About five minutes later, I get done checking my email and doing everything else I can do on my phone, so I begin to do that thing that you do, you know, look around, try and make eye contact with someone so they will hopefully come over and take your order?  No dice. After several minutes of just trying to eyeball someone into coming over and saying boo, I finally get vocal when two young men come near me and begin busing a nearby table. \"Hey guys...\" I say, fairly timidly. The four women at the table a few feet over all stop and turn and stare at me, but so focused are the young men on their work at hand, they hear nothing. They see nothing. They do nothing. I begin to marvel at the amount of time I have been here since being seated by the now phantom hostess and I begin to play that game in my head which I'm not sure you know or if it has a real name but which I will call the \"how long do you think I could actually sit here before anything happens\" game. It is now that I begin to get miffed. I'm embarrassed by having had to cry out for the attention that I didn't get and it's about now that I actually count the number of employees I can see who are apparently completely unable to see me.  Finally, one of the young men comes back to my area, though still blissfully unaware of me. It was kind of interesting, he was looking around, left and right, right and left, the entire time, I am waving my hand up and down in what I am increasingly certain will be a vain attempt to get him to see me, but he finally does. When he sees me though, he doesn't hustle right over and apologetically ask me if I have been waiting long. No, he gets a sour look on his face and looks around the room again, as if to say \"where the hell did everyone go?\" I understood how he felt. Apparently he was not an authorized employee for my quadrant of the restaurant because, after shifting around uncomfortably looking for someone in earshot who he could call over to send my way he decided that that wasn't possible just at this moment (YOU DON'T SAY) and came over to my table, weakly informing me that he \"could take my drink order.\"  Take my drink order. Not \"good afternoon,\" not \"hey how's it going,\" not \"you were waving your hand like a crazy person you must have been sitting here FOREVER I'm so sorry about that can I get you a complimentary pita bread while I try and hunt down and murder the server who has been criminally ignoring you?\" No, none of this, instead, he could take my drink order. I don't even have a drink order. All I want is water, which used to just magically show up on my table on its own at Pita Jungle. Used to.  \"You know what,\" I say. \"Nevermind.\" I walked right out and drove to Souper Salad. They don't have that mind-blowing baba but they do have tuna skroodle and at least I can serve myself.",

However, they are very quick with any requests and the food comes out quickly. They are very consistent and I haven't found something I don't like on their menu and will continue to keep trying new things! Definitely try the nachos, garlic mushrooms and lavosh shawarma wrap!",

    "text": "Well I've been at this Greek food thing for a little while now and I can say with certainty that this is one of the better places I've eaten. I have not been to any other Pita Jungle location, because this was my first time eating there... but I've had many a chicken schwarma. I was a little put off by the lack of description on the menu of what their items actually had in them. For someone that had no experience with Greek food, my mom was overwhelmed trying to figure out what to eat on the menu. I was kind of annoyed also that they didn't call their food what it is traditionally called really at any other Greek place I've been to. Some of the names were the same, but saying Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita... one would think, WTF is that?  This place was REALLY loud when we went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I don't even want to know what this place is like Friday or Saturday night. Fortunately, there was no wait while I was in but that didn't stop us from being here for longer than I would have liked to. Our waiter wasn't all that attentive. Probably the best part of dining at this location is being able to sit out on the patio by the water and see the ducks floating by. However, the tables and chairs on the patio are rather uncomfortable and you'd think for a place that is doing so well they'd be able to put out a better patio scene. Anyways, I would probably go back if I lived in the area. I've paid less for better.",

I'm grew up eating Mediterranean cuisine of all types so I had a good idea of what to expect. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is a native of mainland China so this was something fairly new for her.  We shared the Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus appetizer, Gyro Bowl with Brown Rice, and California Beach Lavosh Wrap The portion sizes were more than enough for the two of us and we were thoroughly satisfied.  Everything was as good as one could expect from Pita Jungle, although it would have been nice if the pita bread served with the hummus had been a bit fresher and warmer. My girlfriend mentioned that she thought the Gyro Bowl was a little \"heavy\" however I assured her that it was typical of this type of cuisine.  Courteous service, the prices were fairly reasonable, really nice location, and this is a decent  place to stop, especially for those if you who are familiar with this type of cuisine.

Manager never came over to check up on us, despite being told by Christina.  It gets old hearing \"the kitchen staff is on high turnover\" and \"we're sorry!\"   I drove 20 minutes to my appointment, opened my takeout to find my order COMPLETELY WRONG.  It's frustrating when you are willing to pay good money for decent food, but don't get it.  I hate to say it, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. There's only so many second and third and fourth chances you can give before speaking with your wallet.",

Pita jungle has the BEST HAPPY HOUR around. My favs are the falafel, the shrimp, mushrooms, hummus and garlic dip. Soooo good!! We're pescatarians so can't review the meat dishes, but the spinach pasta is one of my personal favs. Don't think I've ever had anything here that wasn't wonderful, and thrilled that they have so many great meatless choices. Our server once recommended we try the Chipotle flatbread with tofu, insane!!! I know, many don't get real starry eyed over tofu, but this, omg, was absolutely incredible!!!  Always good food, the service is exceptional, the servers are knowledgeable and fun, and the patio on the water is a very nice plus.",

I'm not a vegetarian, but omg probably was the best thing I've ever had at Pita Jungle.  Kudos to the chef for the new recipe.   Can someone please give another shout out to Adan?  He is probably the best server Pita Jungle has in the state.   I can say that because we eat at PJ weekly at multiple locations.   His service is impeccable and he is so cheerful, my family and I were happy to see him on Saturday's visit.",

    "text": "You can never go wrong with eating at any of the Pita Jungle locations.  I've been here several times and my family usually orders the same things because it's so delicious. First off, always order the humus trio! It's delicious and my favorite is the cilantro-jalapeno humus. We usually order it with chicken and it automatically comes with pita. If you are there from 3-6pm, you can order the humus trio as a tapas and it only costs $1.  Their are amazing salads, like the pesto salad, tasty wraps, like the shawarma pita and yummy burgers. I highly recommend the broiler fish sandwich! It's delicious! It comes with a side of potatoes, which can get overcooked at times. But the fish is always well cooked and the spicy sauce is amazing! I use it for my sandwich and for my tomatoes. You definitely can't go wrong with that option!  We never get dessert because we are always stuffed, but they have some delicious options, like a baklava bread pudding.   There is also a rotating special menu that has some unique options, like a Mediterranean turkey burger or chipotle chicken wrap. It's worth a shot!",

My son doesn't eat a gyro, but loves the mean, bread and just cucumbers on the side - they always accomodate.  Last visit our food was cold and they had to re-fire it.  I didn't ask to talk to a manager, but he came over and said that he would cover our entire meal.  I offered to pay for half since the food wasn't bad - but we ate the second version, he refused.  Now that's quality services.  ALSO, their Baklava is amazing!",

From location to location the taste is slightly off but tonight, it was way off at one of the best tasting locations that I LOVE to dine at (Chandler).  My Gambos dish was very sour, it tasted like they forgot the garlic and put a dash too much tomato paste.  As a matter of fact that was all that I had tasted.  My children's hummus tasted like mashed fava beans with a dash of tahini...no flavor at all.    I had asked my waitress if the ingredients has changed and she advised me that they have a new distributor and cut back the oil portion used to mix the hummus.  If these changes are permanent, it appears my frequency in dining here will change.  Pita Jungle, PLEASE go back to how you cooked things from the beginning!",

Ahead of us were a couple of girls in there that were drinking while one was already drunk, and when their guy friends left, the drama starts with bouts of crying, then giggling, then crying again etc etc. On our right was another couple of girls who had another drama ridden discussion, with juicy details of how she is a biter in bed and got a little over zealous on a recent \"adventure\".

    "text": "Having had a fantastic experience at the Gilbert (Val Vista and Williams Field) location with our entire staff for a employee's anniversary lunch, I figured Pita Jungle should be Pita Jungle, right?  And the Chandler location is closer to our workplace, so I called and let them know that two days hence, we would be treating one of our employees to his anniversary lunch.        We would be a party of fifteen, and although I know they don't take reservations, I wanted to find out what we can do to make it less of a surprise for them, and smoother sailing for our healthcare office's staff (we would have a set period of time to eat and get back to see the afternoon patients).      She reiterated they don't take reservations.  I know, sweetie, I know.  I'm just calling to give you a head's up that we're going to show up at noon in 2 days' time and we would like for that to not be hard on your staff.  Or mine.  \"Okay,\" she said, stating she would make a note, \"but it isn't a reservation.\"  Okay, I gotcha.     I called the day before to re-remind them we'd be there in one day, at noon, with 15 hungry people.  \"We can't, we don't, we won't,\" etc, she says.  I know, honey, I know you don't take reservations, I know what you can't and don't do in terms of reservations. Do you ACCEPT larger parties? \"Yes,\" she says.  \"So, I'm just calling to see what CAN be done\" I say.  \"I'll make a note but you can't have a reservation.\"  My goodness, it's never been harder for me to arrange to drop a few benji's on a small establishment.  The Gilbert location was gracious, had left a few tables in one area free, then scooted them together when our party arrived (just a couple months prior) and had us seated in one minute flat, gracious and happy to see us... so I figured with the ample heads-up, the Chandler location would probably do the same, right?     Right?      We show up, 15 of us, at noon the next day.  The young, male (old enough to drive, too young to drink) host is astounded at the size of our party. Like, he has never SEEN 15 people all together at one time before, ASTOUNDED.  I mention that while we know they don't do reservations, I've called ahead two days, and one day, prior. *crickets* She said she would make a note, let you all know we would be coming so you could plan ahead. *crickets*  To make sure you wouldn't be overwhelmed by our party. *crickets*  Because we are celebrating a much-loved employee's anniversary and it's really important because this is his favorite restaurant.  *crickets*        \"Well,\" he sighs, \"I don't know anything about that but it's going to be at LEAST a half hour wait. Is that okay?\"        There's no harm in asking nicely, so I did.  \"Well, actually, is there anything that can be done? We have about 49 minutes of lunch time left, so that doesn't really enable us to eat, is there any room out on that big patio? There's a large table down the middle of the restaurant that's just the right size for our party, which was completely empty, until you sat two people in the middle of it, like, 4 seconds before we were greeted, could they potentially sit somewhere else? Because we'd fit right there and they don't even have a water glass yet; I would pay for their lunch.\"        No.  There was obviously nothing he was willing to do, so I let him know that anything they can do is appreciated, because all 15 of us are here, and there's no time to arrange anything new.  So we wait for 19 minutes, and he comes over and tell us \"It's going to be at least another 40 minutes, so is that okay?\"      No.  That wasn't okay, not even remotely okay, and honestly I expect to be treated like this at Oregano's, pal, but I really didn't see this one coming. Why would you tell us 30 minutes, and 11 minutes short of the 30 minutes, tell us it's another 40 minutes?  You've been seating everyone who came in the door.  I asked if there was a manager. Nope.  Is there anyone I can talk to? (Because I'm thinking as a manager, I see potential solutions to this problem passing before my eyes with every choice you make, friend.)  Nope.         I know the kid is young.  And this is not his place.  And he can't possibly have enough experience to even know what customer care looks or sounds like... but he couldn't have possibly been slow enough to think that, on any level, this was okay.       So, in order to not break my recent goals of never saying reactive things, I simply walked out the door.  Saw Valle Luna just down the walk, and walked in there to ask if they'd seat us.  Sure, they said, come on over!      So all 15 of us mobbed down to Valle Luna, had just about the most delicious chips and salsa I've ever had, cold drinks on the table right away, and hot lunch served up within about 10 minutes, a check and boxes shortly thereafter, and we were back to the office on time, stuffed full of really delicious and satisfying food.  Please consider going there; they were fantastic.",

I haven't found a favorite dish yet, darn... more research needed. Last week I enjoyed a tureen of Roasted Tomato Soup. Yes, I said tureen due to the size of their \"bowl\". Nice thing was I took it home and still had 2 servings. I think next time I'll try the sampler my friend had, it looked amazing.  Why only 4 stars you ask? I found their hummus bland.....needs a little kick of garlic if you ask me. I see the red pepper hummus favorably reviewed-I'll order it next time.",

This location has \"the lake\" which has an amazing view and PJ has wonderfully outfitted their patio so you can sit outside for all of the seasons. They have several heaters outside, plants, flowers- Just beautiful. The inside has dark wood tables, a giant ornate mirror in the back and pictures/paintings on all of the walls.   They had me by the first sentence but I also absolutely love their falafel platter, thousand bean pita- (DE-Lisious open faced pita), and of course the hummus. Their happy hour is seriously ridiculous!  Hummus for a $1?!  I know, I'm getting carried away here but it's True! Their food is fresh, bursting with flavor and priced for what you get. I never eat my whole meal and always take half of it home with me. And they even give you a to-go cup for your drinks (non-alcoholic that is).   This is a place I can go eat, not feel guilty, stuff myself and have a good time with friends and family.",

My girlfriend picked up the check so I don't have the server's name.  As I mentioned, both locations I have to ask for napkins and refill on water.  I am going to meet another girlfriend today at Ahwatukee location, hoping things will be different. I love your restaurant and by writing this review... I hope you guys can improve on it.

So, I had one of my favorites, One Thousand Beans, which is definitely a two meal dish.  Leftovers will go well with scrambled eggs or egg whites.  Le bf had the salmon burger and he so obviously was satisfied because he said so.  He ordered us up a bowl of vanilla yogurt for dessert but since the waiter said it was just a scoop he said \"give us two.\"   Well, it was way more than just a scoop (see picture).  There is a yogurt store right or almost beside this PJ so maybe they have a cooperative thing going on (wouldn't that be nice and novel) and they run over to the yogurt store for this dessert.  Oh, and I should mention that the was service good.  Our waiter was extremely personable in a genuine way.  I am giving this PJ in Chandler 5 stars because it was, all in all, a good dining experience.",

The Gambas Con Ajo is amazing! The Mediterranean chicken salad and tabouli are also really tasty, fresh, healthy dishes. Actually, pretty much everything on the menu is fresh and healthy, which is one of the reasons we eat there so much.    The ambiance and customer service cannot be beat! They feature different artists' work and the rest of the decor has a comfortable, artistic feel as well. They pull of a high-end feel without the atmosphere being uncomfortable. It's perfect for a dressy date night or casual lunch. They also have a really nice outdoor seating area that faces a small lake. The staff are all very personable and even when they are super busy (which is pretty much always because they're so awesome!) we get served in a timely manner and our drinks are always refilled.",

We finally reached the front of the line when two ladies skipped everyone and put themselves on the list ahead of us. Calmly, I said, \"I just wanted to let you know that we have been here and they just cut in front of us\" and the host looked at us and said \"so you're mad about that? Get over it it's just a line.\" Mind you, we are just trying make sure he knew that those ladies were in the wrong and we weren't mad. A brief description of the host is rather short, dark hair probably in his 30's. We were extremely taken aback by this. It's disappointing because this is my regular location. As reaction like that is very unacceptable in food service. I get being very busy and stressed out, I work in a restaurant that gets much busier that what they were handling, in fact I host as well.

It so nice and peaceful to sit outside, watch the ducks and eat their cilantro jalapeno hummus!  Everything I've had at this place is delicious.  The gyros are made with just the right amount of tzazkiki sauce, the hummus is smooth and creamy and EVERY flavor is a must try.  I tried the mediterranean chicken salad just this last weekend and my taste buds were in heaven!  So lemo juice, feta and pine nuts took the salad over the top.  Now if we could only convince the owners to branch out to California, say Westlake or Thousand Oaks area I bet these would take off.  With all us health food nuts out here we would appreciate the good food!  :)",

The tabouli was incredibly flavorful, chicken was perfectly cooked and the salad was loaded with delicious veggies. So so filling and perfect lunch for me!!! Service was quick and everyone was friendly. Will make the drive from south Gilbert to here anytime",

The waitress suggested that I try the green Sriracha instead of the red one. I did and for some reason it was not as hot as the red for me. The green one did taste real good with my gyros. The gyros for me was very tasty and I was very satisfied with my choice. I must compliment the waitress we had, she is very good at what she does. For the taste of the food and the service I will give it a four stars. Keep in mind I am not a good reviewer but, I was very pleased.",

He was very friendly, welcoming, and all of us could tell that he genuinely loved his job- and the food served at pita jungle. He had great recommendations, he had answers to everyone's questions, and he made all of us so excited to receive our food because of how up-beat he was! (And everyone really enjoyed their food!) When we arrived the restaurant was busy (with it being dinner time on a Saturday, and happy hour was going on) so Adan had many other tables- both inside and on the patio. With that being said, he still managed to make sure to check back multiple times, always made sure that our drinks were filled, brought extra napkins, and brought us sauces to go with our food. I can only imagine that he gave the same amazing service to his other tables.   I don't receive service like this too often- Adan is definitely a gem. I would 100% come back and ask to be seated in his section. All 6 of us left Pita Jungle with smiles on our faces because of Adan, so I wanted to highlight how awesome he was!",

Today I received the most tasteless, horribly presented and put together Shawarma in my entire life.  I'm SOOO hungry AND I don't waste food, so I'm going to consume what I've purchased. But wow..  - soggy pita so much that it broke after 1 bite  -  visibly (and taste tested)  unseasoned chicken - barely there veggies (barely any lettuce and it looked like it had been soggy before putting it in there - tasteless sauce/hummus. How do you even make hummus that bland?! It was RUNNY.  I'm most disappointed in the nasty texture of the hummus and whatever other sauce they lumped in there, AND disappointed in this tasteless food they sent me. Of ALL the things Mediterranean's do well, it's season their food. I can tell you that not even salt was used on this. That's how poorly it tasted.  I will not be ordering from this Pita Jungle again.  - update.. I tried to finish it. Grabbed a piece of the pita (alone) and tried to eat it. HOLY HELL... whatever that taste is, is NOT Pita. It tasted like a mop water. Just gross. Do better PJ... jeez",

They get docked a bit because it seems a bit slow sometimes and the restaurant is always very noisy.  If you don't really want to chat it's ok, or just sit outside and watch the ducks.

Standouts are: -Lavash pizzas (i know pizza at Mediterranean place? but trust me this is the best thing on the menu) Glazed chicken or the chipotle are a must, crispy crust and big ol chunks of chicken. -Hummus is great, red pepper, cilantro/jalapeno and traditional -Gryo, good size portion -Med plate, good sampler platter -Fruit and cheese bowl, good lord this is a bunch of fruit and cheese!  So far nothing has disappointed but its really hard not to get the lavash and hummus every time.  Atmosphere is really laid back, servers especially (definitively can wear what they want). Nice rotating artwork throughout the place that can be purchased.  This location sits next to a little lake so its had a good vibe unless the ducks bug you :-)",

Just an all-around mouthwatering, flavor-complimenting Gyro experience.  Also worth noting is that this particular location sits next to a \"lake,\" so the outside seating makes for a very pleasant alfresco dining experience -- when it's not blazing hot, that is.

I am a creature of habit so I tend to order the same thing a lot (delicious babaganoosh, lavosh pesto turkey wrap, grilled veggies, chicken..etc) but I must say that I have never been disappointed in anything I've eaten at Pita Jungle. The food is very fresh and they have plenty of healthy choices which is important to me.  The portions are large so I can split a meal or bring home left overs. The prices are fantastic for the amount and quality of food that you get.  The atmosphere at this Pita Jungle is fantastic.  I am a huge fan of sitting on the porch by the lake! In addition to that, I love the fact that the employees are encouraged to truly be unique individuals in how they dress and express themselves. I appreciate the diversity and ability to feel totally comfortable with my surroundings. There is one server in particular (Bo) that I have really been impressed with.  He (and the manager) have ensured that I have a positive experience with every visit. The service has always been outstanding as the employees and manager clearly care about customer service and make it their top priority.  I cannot recommend Pita Jungle enough...you will not be disappointed!",

We ended up walking over (again, because of the parking lot and it's a good family walk before and after dinner from where we live). The staff was very helpful; we had a baby stroller and our dog with us. The girl got us a table on the patio closest to where we could tie up the dog and leave the stroller outside off their grounds so we could stay closeby.  May I say, I intended to try the hummos but have had bad hummos experiences nearby, so I just got the small. mmmmmmmmm it was WONDERFUL. We ended up ordering another hummos--large, this time, and she split the large 1/2 and 1/2--1/2 regular, 1/2 cilantro jalapeno (based on other Yelp reviews, we wanted to try it). We ate every bite. The pita bread came out warm (not like some places where you apparently have to ask for warm pita bread).  The pita chips weren't that good, so we ended up chucking them out to our dog, who gladly ate them all :)  The chicken portion on the salad was HUGE, as was the salad. Another reivewer mentioned that the chef didn't know how to cut the lettuce into normal pieces, and I agree. I shouldn't have to shove a huge partial-romaine leaf into my mouth or wonder how to cut it or should I rip it with my hands first, kind of an ordeal.  We ended up sharing my salad, as the gyro was big enough for 1 person, but my hubby works outdoors so he always can eat his and part of mine if need be.  Normal people would probably ended up having a doggie bag to take home.  If it's nice enough to sit outside, do so; it's right by the Lake at Andersen Springs and a lovely atmosphere.",

    "text": "Shmeh.  Pita Jungle (pronounced hoon-glay...kidding, not really) is an area standard in many respects, but when looked at objectively, it's kind of a mish mosh.  And a mediocre one at that.  Don't get me wrong - the food isn't bad.  It's just that if you are jonesing for anything Mediterranean, this is not your place.  The menu is loosely inspired by mid east cuisine, but really, it's more of an upscale, continental restaurant with hummus barely wafting through the air.  Chicken in any form is well-seasoned and moist, baba ghanoush is toothsome, as is hummus, though not better than Trader Joe's, sadly.  Taboule used poorly chopped curly parsley (really, that stuff should be reserved for garnishes and nothing else - flat parsley is the way to go) and was a little underdressed.  Hubby's salmon was fishy and tasted like it hadn't been seasoned.  Underwhelming all in all.  That all being said, with the lake view, well-appointed decor, modern art slicked walls, live music and potent drinks, this place is more of a spot for sipping and nibbling than tucking into generous plates of mideast fare.  Maybe they should call it the Pita Lounge (minus the pita).",

As much as I love the food I think the kitchen staff should take a little more time in preparing their dishes. The other day I ordered a lentil salad for lunch that was soo delicious but I'm 99% sure the rice was bad and I became violently ill right after lunch. Too bad...   Secondly, I ordered a vegan version of a meal that did have chicken in it and substituted it for tofu for my vegan friend. I came home with the food to come to find chicken was in his meal. This could have been really bad if we didn't notice it right away.   I just hope that someone from Pita can read this post and realize that a loyal customer just wants to give some constructive criticism. I love this restaurant but if I keep running into these situations I'm going to have to deem it another careless chain restaurant which is NOT what I'd want to do at all.",

The waitress we had was one of those few that you just feel comfortable with. She also was on top of our requests by brining the check right in time.   The food, as usual, was delicious. Now I have the habit of getting the same thing every time, but how can you refuse the Mediterranean Chicken Salad? I did get a taste of on of their cold soups. It was described as almost a salsa flavor, but was so much  more than that. The flavors here are always on point.   Make sure the try the ice tea here. No sugar needed as it has the right kind of flavor to appeal to the masses sugar free! Not bitter but still tastes like something.   I feel like this location will become my new favorite spot.",

There was no meat in it but it was still very filling. There were equal parts baby spinach and pasta and plenty of other goodness as well (tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers). The best part was the dressing. I am pretty picky about salad dressings but Pita Jungle is great because they made theirs fresh in house and they have one that is just simple lemon juice and olive oil which is what I do at home. This salad had a little of that dressing plus some wonderful pesto sauce which is out of this world. The result was amazing flavor and freshness that just blew me away.  Go try the spinach pasta salad right now and you'll thank me later.",

It has been a while since I have been to this location. It is so close but yet so far! The food was great but I had to drop the rating by one star because the service was just not up to par.   Our dining choices were the red pepper hummus (a must), grilled chicken pita, beef gyro pita with garlic potatoes, and an old fave spicy chicken wrap.",

    "text": "Strange as it may feel to order something called the \"Philly Steak Pita\"--on the same menu with the \"Macro Platter\" (steamed veggies and tofu)--the Philly is one of the best items you can get here. It's finger-searing hot, a dripping mess of thin-sliced beef with grilled peppers, onions, and melting mozzarella cheese, a satisfying handful of goodness that's begging for an extra dollop of hummus or garlic sauce to create a stream of perfect bites. All for less than 7 bucks.  I've been going to Pita Jungles for at least 15 years now, starting at the location by ASU and now mostly at this Chandler location. It's our standby when we want something on the healthy side. Very few items on the menu have ever disappointed, and the bang-for-the-buck here is high.   Beyond the Philly, my favorites include: grilled veggie salad, chicken combo, and the lavosh shawarma wrap.  I'd agree that the service can occasionally be a little snooty, trying to be a bit too-hip-for-you, but generally, we get good service here.",

    "text": "My love affair with Pita Jungle is a long one.....perhaps longer than any other restaurant, certainly longer than I can remember, and at least for the adult portion of my life, which is why it pains me to write this review.   For the last 6 months, I have ordered takeout one day a week from this location, typically on a Friday or Saturday. The ridiculousness that has become my adult life has necessitated a heavy reliance on takeout for my main source of nourishment. Although the food is always spot on at Pita, my takeout experience has been anything but.   The prior 3 out of 4 times I went to pick up my food, I ended up waiting past the promised time. Now I'm not unreasonable, waiting 5 or 10 minutes is not a big deal, but each time has been a wait of 25 to 30+ minutes past the pick up time, with no apologies or explanations. I was beginning to wonder if they had ever started cooking my food before I got there. The last time I must've looked really irritated, because I was offered an obligatory baklava for my wait.   Used to the wait, I started showing up 5 to 10 minutes past the promised time, just as preventative maintenance. Imagine my surprise when my order was ready as promised thie time. I left with my bag of food and a smile on my face. I get back to my friend's house, open the bag, and begin to realize just how badly the order has been screwed up. We ordered 4 items, 3 of which were wrong. I load one item up and head back to Pita. Making me wait a ridiculous amount of time for my food is one thing, but blatantly screwing up my order is too much. As I explain my situation to the takeout girl, she goes to get the Manager who proceeds to inform me that I ordered it wrong. As I struggle to keep my cool, I inform them that they must be mistaken. One item was ordered with chicken, my item was turkey, and the other two were salads. Everything came with chicken. The salads were for my vegetarian friends, and I'm allergic to chicken. There's no way you're going to convince me I ordered chicken for myself and two vegetarians. Sorry, try again. Without too much ado, the correct dishes were provided, and yet another obligatory baklava was offered. I declined. There is only so much wrong that baklava can right. Don't get me wrong, their baklava is amazing, but it's not going to make up for them screwing up my order, then trying to blame it on me. Oh, and did I mention that they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer? Too bad the coupon expires in a few days.   I'm afraid I will be taking my weekly Friday takeout business elsewhere, until enough time has passed that maybe, just maybe, I can find it in my heart to forgive Pita Jungle. In the meantime, I suggest you try to get it together down there. In case you missed the count, that's 4 out of the last 5 takeouts you missed the mark on, including 1 you tried to blame on me. That's shameful.",

    "text": "Pita Jungle = wholesome love.  I'm a big fan and lover of Pita Jungle and have frequented the original Tempe location numerous times ever since hs back in 98 and have enjoyed many chicken shwarmas and hummus plates BUT the Chandler location rocks! I just love their space in the Anderson Springs Plaza, it's airy, love the art, the lighting, the staff and the overall feel. Atmosphere aside, like the Pita in tempe and the Jungle in Mesa at Dobson and Southern, the food is just awesome. I believe this is the location that I fell in love with my all time favorite item on the menu and that is the chicken pasta salad, a concoction of Marinated grilled chicken breast tossed with rotini pasta, fresh tomatoes, with lemon vinaigrette. Eversince first bite, I have been enamored by this simple pasta salad, the lemon vinaigrette is simply delicious intermixed with the pasta, I usually ask for extra tomatoes coz i love my lycopene. And I tend to order it often, I must remind you all that I'm not a fan of the norm but this dish does it to me. Anywho, tonight, I tried something new, after being reassured by my friend Dani that it's alright to live life on the edge, so, i got myself the Philly Steak Pita. YUM, liked it not loved it but I'll order it again in the future. BUT i still love my chicken pasta salad.",

I rarely if ever finish even half of my meal which gives me lunch for the next day.  I've had ever appetizer and they are all solid.  The nachos are a meal in itself.  They have tons of vegetarian options for those that don't eat meat or folks like me that want a break from it every once in a while.    We never pay more than $30 for 2 people and that includes two meals an appetizer and a couple of iced teas.  The place is very laid back and attracts a wide range of characters.  Someone forgot to tell them there is a recession, very busy during dinner time.  The food always comes out quick though.    Pita Jungle is in the weekly rotation for us due to the selection, affordability, and casual atmosphere.",

I gladly drive (yes, I used 'glad' and 'drive' in direct relation) the 15 minutes to eat here (or carry out).   The menu is diverse, fresh and healthy, and there are tons of veggie options. I've been twice - last time with a friend who was living here (thanks, Dave!) and this time on my own - and have had the veggie wrap and tonight had the black bean burger. The veggie wrap was HUGE and had the most unique combo of ingredients - brown rice (like a soft burrito, mmm), broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, carrots and I think a saffron seasoning. It was AMAZING. They were out of the black bean burger that first time so I had to try tonight and was NOT disappointed. Came with sliced roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato and onions and on soft multi-grain bread. Delicious home fries on the side. YUM.   I also recall that their trio of hummus is fantastic. And they have a good selection of bottled beers, including a local organic brew.   As a side note - their Web site is rad! Very neat design and artwork throughout. Props for that, for sure!   Oh - and I almost forgot to mention their dirt cheap prices! This place gets a San Francisco thumbs up, for sure! :)",

I was stunned. I let the hostess know I was there for a pickup and was told to wait. I was brought my order by a wonderful woman who told me I looked like Michael Cera. I'm usually told I look like Lena Dunham or Ted Cruz so this was the best part of my entire week. I apologize if I came off as upset by this comparison.

The inside was dead but the patio was hopping because the weather was so beautiful (as it usually is in the evenings in April). We came in needing protein and that's exactly what we got. My wife loves there glazed chicken lavosh - much like a crackery pizza crust with ample portions of chicken Veges and cheese. She was elated. I on the other hand had a craving for the hummus with chicken with carrots and cucumber (oh and the hummus was cilantro jalapeno which clearly is the best). My portion was huge even though I got the small and everything was perfect, including the Greek pita which is a lot softer than the original pita or gluten free kind. Service was joyful and quick as well as just the right amount of attention. $26 bucks and we were done - score a HUGE value for the date night was! Keep it up #Pitajungle we are believers!!!",

As we were sitting waiting, at least four groups came in after us and were seated immediately. We saw several groups leave but we were never called. We waited 20 minutes and then just left. We would have been fine having two separate tables but no one said anything to us as we were there sitting waiting, even while walking right in front of us. Next time we will try a different location. Disappointed in the poor service at this location.",

But today's post comes due to the exemplary customer service that my friend and I both received.  We came in and while I wasn't sure what to order, I asked Conner to surprise me, and he did.  He was so excited with his choice and even more excited to see how I liked the options he chose for me. Needless to say, he went above and beyond to ensure that I was satisfied.  Pita Jungle, Conner is a great representation of your restaurant and his excitement and passion are evident in the service he provides!  We also met another waiter (think it was Adam someone similar to Conner's age with glasses who had a similar sense of customer service)~Thank you!",

It was very confusing as to who worked there and walked off the street into eat.  The place could use some deep cleaning And more attention to the servers outfits.  Our waitress however looked nice.

    "text": "I've been a customer of Pita Jungle for many years and was very disappointed in my experience this evening.  Although it was a busy night, we were seated almost immediately. Our server took a few minutes before approaching us for our drink orders and we felt as though we were inconveniencing her. She called me \"honey\" and \"baby girl\" multiple times, which is a major pet peeve of mine (I'm 30).   I asked for a glass of wine and we ordered an appetizer and two entrees. Our appetizer was served by a runner and another runner served our entrees. This runner asked if there was anything else that she could do. I asked about the glass of wine that I had ordered. She quickly responded, \"Oh yes. That's on it's way now.\" A few minutes later our server stopped by to check on us and I asked about the wine, again. She acknowledged that I had ordered wine and left to go get the glass.   Meanwhile, I began to chow down on the Chicken del Sol- one if my favorite dishes and the reason we went to Pita Jungle tonight. I was extremely disappointed to discover that it was extra soupy and had little flavor. It is a soup, but it tasted very watery. A manager stopped by to check in on us and I mentioned this his him. He basically said that each chef on staff cooks differently and that it is supposed to be brothy. I completely understand that restaurants have different chefs, however, I believe that good restaurants are consistent in their menu items. I also have ordered this dish many times, for many years now, and it has never tasted so bland. There were no apologies and no attempts to fix the situation.   Finally my wine came! Again, there were no apologies. Instead, the server looked towards the table behind us, noticed that they had not been served their dinner, and asked to herself, \"Where is their dinner?\" That table seemed very upset, as did the man at the table next to them. I observed him attempting to wave down someone to take his order twice (the manager included).   The check came and I paid. When our server  returned my card she said to me, \"It worked, honey. Now you don't have to do the dishes.\" She probably was trying to make a joke, but it wasn't the way that I wanted to end an already negative experience.",

They put a table together and our server did a good job making sure everyone had what they needed and did separate checks which was above and beyond. Here's the real reason for this review and I hope someone who has any say in what goes on there gets this message. The lentil fattoush had so much garlic in it, it could have killed a horse. I took 3-4 bites and had dragon's breath immediately. This has always been my favorite dish at PJ, but wow. Yuck. Ruined it for me.

There was a short wait, just a few minutes, and when we were seated the server was very helpful answering questions. I got the Ahi Tuna with hummus starter, and i was able to get fresh veggies instead of pita bread, and my boyfriend had a chipotle chicken pizza. He's a pizza nut and said it was really very good. The tuna was spicier than i expected, hotter than the cilantro jalapeno hummus it was on top of, but all delicious nonetheless. We were both full by the time we got done, and I took home my extra hummus, along with a couple of large to-go cups of lemonade and soda. Will probably be back in the future, just at a time when they're not so packed.",

I almost always have leftovers. I really love the atmosphere too, with the constantly changing wall art and live music. I love taking out of town guests here for a relatively healthy meal. Love sitting on the patio too when it's nice out. Definitely worth checking out!",

Every time I go, which is often, I enjoy 80 percent of my meal. Especially, the cilantro-jalapeno hummus, which I just can't get enough of., and the mixed beans - in or out of a pita. This location is pleasant, too - on a faux-lake and not too crammed like the Tempe location. All that being said - there is WAY too much onion action in most of the dishes I've tried. Big chunks of breath-saturating onion. Most of the time, I can navigate around them, but sometimes I can't. Thus, four stars instead of five.",

That doesn't mean the service is bad, exactly opposite. I have had good service every time I've gone in there. The menu is varied including hummus with chicken, lentil soup, pizzas, pita sandwiches, Greek salads and on and on. They also have a thirst quenching Arnold Palmer (lemonade and iced tea.) They are generous with their portions and are always cool with giving you a \"to go\" cup drink. (Almost a necessity in Arizona summer 100 degree temps!) Don't forget to try the baklava and pistachio ice cream for dessert..Yum! if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you.",

Chandler, with the pond, the patio, and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location, ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier, great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction.  healthy fresh food, great prices, great service, creative atmosphere.",

Good for talking while eating.  Detail:  Two friends and I went on Saturday two weekends ago. I can't remember the time but it was somewhere between 7-9pm. I used to go to the Pita Jungle in Tempe near ASU a lot but it has been about three years since I was there and this was my first time at this location.  The restaurant was full, maybe one or two tables were free the whole time we were there and that's including outside. Service wasn't affected though.  We started with the large plain hummus, it was a lot, basically a whole dinner plate. But the small would have been too little for three people. It was good but not that different than store bought hummus, not saying that's a good or bad thing. Both of my friends got the Gyros which they thought were good.   I can't exactly remember what I got, I wana say it was the chicken shwarma wrap dinner. I thought it was great. The chicken was tasty and kinda of sweet onions and it came with a little Greek salad which I liked. The orders were on the table oddly quick, not that that's a bad thing.  I can't remember the cost, but it was not high for what you get.",

Well Pita Jungle is consistent--on horrible service. The hostess who took my order on the phone was very rude. She constantly told me to \"speak up, I can't hear you\" in a rude manner.  A customer friendly approach would be \"I'm sorry, our restaurant is loud, can you please speak up.\" After placing my order, I asked for the total. She rudely responded \"I don't have it front of me.\"  Again, a nicer approach would be \"I will have your total upon your arrival\" or something to that extent.  Picking up the order was another ordeal of rude service! I often order to go from my favorite restaurants. After 5 experiences of horrible phone service and pick up service, Pita Jungle is a \"no go\" for me!",

    "text": "Pita Jungle used to be the spot, it was fresh on the scene and a great change of pace.  Something completely different and possibly good for you. It was always the place you could bring a date to or even for a business lunch.  It said \"Hey only fatties go to The Olive Garden. I am a sophisticate.  See my fine lady?  See where I have taken you?  This place is as original and hip as I am.\".   Now something has happened. Pita Jungle still has the hip artwork, the ultra-hip non-conformist waitstaff, the great music, the semi-eclectic food, and the possibility of a really good experience. For some strange reason, it just has lost a lot of it's cool. Oh wait, I know. Maybe it is the herd of Douchtards (Douchetards, a Yelper Favorite.) that are compelled to take their little kids out to dinner at a place that is kid unfriendly and lacks a Chernobyl sized rat as a mascot.  This place is so kid unfriendly that there is a lake within drowning distance.  But does that stop the breeders from turning loose their  herd in the restaurant?  Nope. \"Run free children. I will know you are safe because I will always be within ear shot of your constant screaming.\"  (I shudder.). This was not an anomaly either. There were three different families there with three kids each.  Wa-Wa-What?  I don't bring my dates to Chuckie Cheese, so keep your rats out of Pita Jungle. Alright maybe I am being harsh, but if your kids cannot act like respectable human beings, maybe they are not ready for a respectable restaurant.  And another thing,  I love the Grilled Vegetable Salad.  It is my favorite thing on the menu.  But alas, out of the last four times I have ordered it, only once has it lived up to it's delicious memory.  Maybe I should try something else, but when I know how perfect something can be it is hard for me to give up hope so easily.  So to recap: My favorite dish has been ruined. Kids have made a playground of it. Hipness has become tragically un-hip.",

I asked where my change was and she said she  was only given 1 $20 bill and that she had already brought the change for that.  She argued with me till I asked for a manager.  The manager, who I like to refer to as \"slim shady\", was not the manager at all, but was the COOK who was posing as a manager, because the real manager was not there.  He was wearing a wife beater and his pants were hanging around his knees.  He proceeded to say the waitress had worked with him for a long time and that he would vouch that she was a very honest person.  He also was dropping F*** bombs throughout our conversation.  In the end, they said  they would take my number and would call me if her tips were off at the end of the night.  RIGHT!  I never received a call and came to the conclusion that I had probably just bought them their nightly high...  Which leads me to my next gripe about this place.    The staff are a bunch of urban granola hippies. Dreds, tats, hairy pits, and piercings are all the norm.  Don't take your kids here because the odds of the waitresses wearing a bra are probably slim to none.  I would like to know where they get these people.  Enough already... I am wasting my time going any further.    DO NOT EAT HERE EVER!",

    "text": "I headed over to this Pita Jungle for the first time last night for my birthday diner. It was delicious as always. The service was better than I have had at the Mesa and Tempe locations. The fact that this place is so close to my house could be dangerous. We ordered a Chicken Pasta Salad, and the chicken was grilled awesome. I have always loved this dish, but tonight it was spectacular. My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love. Easily one of his favorite dishes. He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish. We also started with a small humus with all three flavors, and an extra pita. My only complaint for the evening was that the pita bread was harder than I prefer, I assume from over warming, but that didn't stop me from eating the entire thing. I also love that they have a covered patio that over looks water. I'll be back soon. Oh, and beware that parking in this plaza is frequently full.",

Since I'm pretty much a regular, the staff is usually very friendly and attentive. (I even bring them backed goodies during the holiday season.) The gazpacho, when available, is a must for me. All flavors of hummus are great, and usually some decent wine choices. Have tried many dishes, and haven't been dissatisfied. Their seems to be something on the menu for all tastes. Also, they're good about substitutions and variations when ordering. (Even Sally would be welcome!) This is one place I will ALWAYS recommend to people who haven't tried before.",

I live near this location on Dobson and Ray, so this has now become my place to go and get hummus and a chicken shwarma.   Since I've been coming here I pretty much only get those two items, knowing that they will be tasty and delicious.  I always order a large hummus and a couple of extra pitas and then box up the rest to eat later.  I gave 4 stars simply because the service can be hit-or-miss.  For example, I have received my food order- had it dropped off at the table and the person turn and leave- while I still have no plate or silverware.  Then I find myself waiting to find someone to ask for a plate and silverware.  Otherwise, start with a hummus and pick something else off the menu...you can't go wrong!  Just make sure you get a plate and silverware before your food!",

    "text": "I had lunch here today with my sister.  Been here before, actually why I returned.  Start off with the bad, the place was packed several months ago when I went with a small group.  Waited way too long for service and had things messed up.  Even went through 3 different servers.  Food was topnotch then and we received a gift card for future visit.  On to the real review:  Lunchtime and wasn't that hungry so I just ordered the hummus and grilled chicken.  Their hummus is wonderfully amazing.  Chicken was tasty, but a tad on the dry side.  Order came with two slabs of pita bread.  Previously it was warm and soft, thought it would be the same.  Nope, it was a little hard and dry.  At least it was warm coming out, but quickly cooled off.  My sister ordered a pesto pizza.  It looked tasty, but was too greasy for her to finish.  I probably would have eaten the whole thing, but was too full of hummus at the time.  Service was excellent, my iced tea never went below half.  That's really the key to service with me.  Billing time was a little confusing, gift card given by manager on previous visit did not run through.  I handed over the debit card, but my patience was rewarded with a complimentary meal in the end.  Thanks, that really swayed the vote on returning ever.  Their menu selections are decent, ranging from wraps, hummus, pizzas, burgers, and salads.  Atmosphere was pleasant for lunch, sat next to the large windows overlooking a pond.  Ducks walked past the windows several times, it was a calm place around noon and midweek.",

I am almost 27 and I seemed to be on the younger side of the crowd, unless people just dress more mature than I was.  For an appetizer we got these amazing nachos that were enough for like 5-6 people.  For my meal I kept it simple and got the falafel pita.  It was very good, but I didn't like the kind of pickles used.  My boyfriend got one of the grilled chicken pitas and he loved it.  It was a little overwhelming with all of the lettuce in the pita.  I didn't get lettuce in mine.  The prices were very reasonable, but the wine was more expensive than what we ate.  It was hard to find a glass of wine that sounded yum under $7/glass.  I would definitely go back, but would probably get a beer instead.",

With so many healthy and delicious options that allow a \"late nighter\" like myself, that is also not a big eater, an opportunity to have a quick, easy, nutritious meal makes Pita Jungle stand out among the late night options.  The staff is eminently professional, sincere as well as inviting. Not once have I felt \"out of sorts\" while being served.  They rotate the art on the wall every month or so giving local artists a chance to present, which is cool.  Not being into art myself I can't really speak to that other than to say, having watched the ritual \"changing of the paintings\" gives the sense of investment in the local community as well as, well, a ritual that makes it seem the place isn't stagnant but a perpetual state of reinvention.  Come alone, bring a friend, or the family.  You won't be dissapointed by the tapas hour.  - John",

It's got lots of windows and lets light in and in the evening, it's not too dark.  We've never had bad food at any of the Pita Jungles, but the ambiance of each one is quite different.  When I was single, I would go with my sister to lunch here.  When I got married, I would go with my husband.  Now that we have children, we go with our children.  Because they have a good variety of foods even for those with allergies, it's a great place to meet up with my siblings and their families.  Love, love, love this place.  However, it's too far from where we live, so when we moved 5 yrs ago, this was just too far to drive and we've cut down on our eating out.  However, this is a great place to great really super delish food at reasonable costs with great service.  If only all restaurants were this good.",

Another time, I went for lunch with a friend, I arrived around noon, the service is awful. Wait staff did not bring out the side hummas, we had to ask a different server for sauce for the gyro, when our server showed up to take the sauce coming from the other server, she stuck her finger it and had to get another one. Then she decided to take the nearby table's order as we waited with to get her attention. I finally helped myself to a shelf to get my own box. We tried to flag anyone to pay and were told we had to wait for the server.   I have served before and my friend currently works in fine dining so we had very little sympathy for the bad service.",

    "text": "Pita Jungle really does healthy/flavorful/Mediterranean exceptionally well. I find myself gravitating towards this location most of all because its outdoor patio overlooks a \"lake\" (some sort of man made pond with a tacky fountain in the middle).  Nonetheless, it's nice to sit outside in a location that doesn't overlook a parking lot or street.  It's also very kid-friendly with dinner options my daughter will actually eat (Mac and cheese with sauce made from scratch, steamed fresh broccoli, low-sodium turkey, and fresh fruit).  It's food I would actually prepare for my daughter myself at home so I don't feel like I'm skimping on nutrition when I come here. At Pita Jungle it also means I can get a nice adult meal for myself without feeling like I've regressed.   I tend to gravitate towards the same dishes - the chicken hummus plate, the tuna + hummus, the salmon dinner with spinach and mashed potatoes, and the gazpacho when it's on their seasonal menu. Their chicken shawarma pita is also a good go-to but the garlic mash can be a little overwhelming.  Their portions are fairly large so the hummus is perfect for sharing and the appetizers can easily be eaten as a main course.   My only criticism (and this is pretty much my experience at all three East Valley locations) is that the wait staff tends to be a bit aloof.    My one wish for improvement is to change change up their seasonal menu a bit more. Because I come here so often, it would be nice to see a Spring 2014 menu that was different from the Spring 2013 menu. Just to throw some variety and excitement in there.   The Chandler location also caters! That's right - not all of them do, but this one does. It's always a big bit at my office when we get it catered in as people are always asking for healthier options.",

I'm currently on a primal diet (no dairy, no gluten, no processed anything). I told him my diet limitations and he didn't seem fazed in the least. He told me about other ingredients that he'll remove that wasn't mentioned on the menu, and was super helpful and accommodating of my weird eating habits.  Plus! The food was good! The place was clean! The atmosphere was really relaxed and casual.  This place was great and I'll definitely be coming back.",

I ordered the red lentil soup (a fav of mine!) and it was served at room temperature and I think they changed the recipe because it was bland, lumpy and grainy instead of smooth and creamy.  so send it back, right?  Sent it back to heat it up and it then it came back only slightly warm.  Just declined it after that.  Really Pita Jungle?  Don't have a microwave?    The veggie burger was yummy and delicious, though.",

I prefer this location rather than the one in Ahwatukee because I like the smaller feel of this location.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is always pretty quick.  I also like this location because you can sit on the patio by the little late which is nice for 'Date Night\" :)   I would definitely get hummus while you're there.  I love their wraps, my boyfriend just had their Kafta burger the other night which was awesome, you can't go wrong with a salad, and I have had a chicken dish from their and also a mahi mahi burger before which was bomb.   Definitely try the caramelized cauliflower while you're there too, because it is fantastic.  I can only have a couple of pieces, so I recommend sharing with your table as an appetizer.  Their green tea is to die for as well.   All in all I recommend pita to anyone! I am on a strict diet, but still find myself at Pita every now and then :)",

Asked how long if I wait for what I wanted instead of simply accepting the chicken because we had a toddler with us.  Just 4-5 minutes.  Okay....15 minutes later, everyone else is 2/3 done with their food & still waiting.  Finally food shows up & look at the pita   \"that doesn't look like the GF one I'm used to. Is that GF?\"  \"Oh yes, server responds, \"that's absolutely a GF pita.\" I eat fast because child is losing patience & we don't want to disturb others.  Luckily out of there with her still happy.  What comes next you ask?  Within a hour SICK AS A DOG, for 3 freaking days.  Obviously NO, that was NOT the gluten free pita......  Horrible experience all around......",

Usually we order out but recently I had a visit to the location the only reason it does not have 5stars is because it was rather hot inside...the air really needed to be on a cooler temp especially as the extreme summer heat is now here.

He was very upbeat, positive and made sure we had everything we needed in a timely manner. He was by far the best waiter I had at any of the Pita Jungles! He makes you feel very welcomed and appreciated as a customer.   We asked Adan to send the manager over so we can pay him a compliment.

Not sure why you have to play music so loud that you can't hear other members of your party.  Also, the open kitchen only adds to the noise.  Unless this restaurant is trying to cater to the club crowd rather than families, I would get it.  That being said, we enjoyed the cilantro hummus with pita, and I had a very good salmon salad.  The baklava for dessert was also very good.  Also, the waiter was very nice and so was the reception staff.

I decided to get the California Beach turkey wrap. The wrap came with a Greek salad and inside the wrap was turkey  tomato, pickles, onions, mixed lettuce, and aoli. All of it was grilled to perfection ans it was absolutely delicious! Especially when I added the siracha sauce!! All of the flavors combined with the sauce made everything just pop and oh so right!  My waitress was so nice and continuously checked on me! I felt so relaxed and not rushes at all! All of this delicious food only added up to be $11 with tax and I got to take half home!!

    "text": "So far everything I have tasted here has been out of this world!  It seems to me that they must make their Hummus from scratch because I can find nothing like it anywhere else.  Especially since moving away from the area.  Top things to get:  1.)  Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus and/or Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus with their hot pita breads.  They used to have a hummus trio which was really good.  Although my favorite hummus is still the RBPH.  2.)  Mediterranean Roasted Chicken Pita!  Amazing in taste!  Probably because of the type of sauce they put in it.  Not as large in portion size as I'd like to see but decent.  3.)  Gyro!  What's not to love about the GYRO!  Items to consider:  1.)  Pesto Pizza and Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza ask to add olives and mushrooms if you like.  Although they are fresh in ingredients, they still are missing some flavor in the sauce.  Or maybe it's the fact that there is little to no pizza sauce period.  Maybe ask for extra pizza sauce in regards to the type of pizza ordered?   2.)  Never have tried these items but always have wanted to:  the Wood-Fired Fresh Salmon, Grilled Vegetable Salad, and the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips!  Looks good, sounds good!  Check out the pictures if you can.  3.)  And last but not least would love to try out the Pineapple Orange Guava Banana Smoothie!",

I'm seriously craving a gyro or baba but no one is open past 9pm except Pita jungle! Then, I get inside and can't make up my mind what I want. Hummus? Feta? Pita w/olive oil and spices? Oh wait, it's happy hour! I'll have tapas! One of each for $1-$2 per piece! Oh, margaritas are $2 during happy hour? Don't mind if I do! For $10 I have my fill of food with a margaritas to boot, getting a taste of everything and trying something new, and I'm in bed by 10:30pm. With the money I saved on the meal, I generously tip my server and everyone goes home happy.  I have never had anything bad here. Some things are mediocre, but for the price I can't and won't complain. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The first few times I asked the server for recommendations and they were all as described and exactly what I was hoping they would be.",

I recently had their cheese and spinach quesdilla with chicken and fell in love!! Happy Hour is the best time go if you want a quick drink and filling snack, very well priced items.   I gave THIS location 3 stars because the service is always spotty, no one really smiles at you, and if you order food to go, they will NOT heat up the pitas. I have even complained before about this because,  lets be honest, who eats a COLD pita and enjoys it. My response was \"Its something we choose not to do. You can request it on your next order.\" Seriously? I've had to go orders from many other Pita Jungles and they some how managed to find the time to heat up my pitas. Get it together!",

Two falafel balls?  $1.  Garlic chicken? $2.  Streamed mussels? $2.  Plus tons of other options...you could easily eat an entire meal there for just a couple of bucks.  The service was fine when we went - not even the slightest delay - but it was also in between meal times and not crowded.  However, the strip mall itself was packed.  It is always packed.  The parking lot stresses me out.  So, go at your own risk, and don't bother trying to park close.",

My friend and I \"splurged\" and shared like 6 items off the menu + 2 glasses of cabernet which was definitely NOT bad at all for $3. Everything was delicious so I don't think there's a need to go into detail about each one. The side plate of pita made everything that much better as well.   The interior is modern and lively. Nice patio for those who like enjoying the heat/arizona breeze in front of a nice man made lake =p  Will definitely be back!",

The girl sat down at a dirty table 2. Both bathrooms  (M&F)were very dirty 3. Some of the wait staff was in another world  4. Leftover food on the patio deck and not pick up  I had asked one the wait staff to pick up the food from the deck and look at me like I was speak another language. After speaking with manager he did send someone over and it was finally taken care of. Where the common sense with food works today, and you is want better wages well take better care of your work environment so your customers would enjoy coming into your home to eat.  The manager also needs to be more visible and walk through his business or none of this would of happen.",

We came all the way from north phoenix and we were all extremely hung over so it kind of made the experience kind of worst. But no that's not why it was a bad experience. We had to wait about 15 mins for our drinks, I had no cuttery so I had to steal my roommates,  she was just slow. I don't know if she was new or not but the restaurant was like empty. I'm a server and I'm sorry if your service is that slow when the place is practically empty then you shouldnt be a server.   Despite the horrible service, the food was good, I had the blackbean burger and it was so good. Everything was good because everyone got something different and they all were satisfied. The restaurant was cool it was totally my style. The staff seemed super chill and friendly. Oh and I totally want thay awesome wine rack they have when you first walk in.  But I will totally be back maybe not to this location but one closer",

    "text": "I walked in this afternoon CRAVING the (insert long name) Chicken Shawarma, walked by a table while we were being seated and I know I was probably gawking, but I wasn't drooling -yet.  Why in the world would Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini cause such a reaction?!  I mean it's Cauliflower.  I have a thing for Cauliflower, so we ordered it.   This afternoon I decided to try something new and this was just a start.  My lunch choice is Beef Kafka. The starter was good.  I want the recipe or at least the basic instructions.  Nice touch with the Pine Nuts and Onions. The Beef Kafka is what I would call a Mediterranean version of a Tostada, or maybe Nachos.  Lavosh topped with cheese, beef, tomatoes, grilled onions, jalapenos, green onion, Pine nuts, and a creamy sauce lightly across the length.   The flavors blended well.  If possible the flavors blended TOO well.  I enjoy being able to differentiate the flavors of the various items that come together to create a dish, this one wasn't giving me that.  May be one of the reasons I like Shawarma?   Don't get me wring, the Beef Kafka was good but I couldn't keep my gaze from wandering over to my sons meal.  What do you call that?  Oh yeah, Pesto Pizza on Lavosh for $1.50 more. Maybe I'll try that next time.  Our server was super sweet and darned efficient too.  We talked briefly before I ordered cuz my son had stepped away momentarily.  So yah, uh huh, she thought it was a date scenario  and didn't realize that I was the young mans mother.  Oh Jiminy and Jay Jose' Phat ().... Yep, Mom here.   So we giggled for a minute and it was back to business.  Pita Jungle is one of those places I like to go to occasionally cuz I don't want to get bored with the menu. The relaxed atmosphere appears naturally well lit which makes being able to see the menu a real possibility.  Art by local talent is promintly displayed, the nearby water feature provides a peaceful view, and the decor is eclectic (?), Bohemian (?), or simply a crazy mish mash of someone's personal style.  I'll be back again soon for the Jalapeno and Cilantro Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. OH yeah, that Cauliflower dish I mentioned, I saw several more orders go out while we were there.  Must be a popular item.  And I almost forgot to mention something I didn't like. Soda/tea for almost $3.00. -I almost spit up. I guess that might be a way to discourage people from drinking soda, but tea?   Or maybe they're trying to encourage customers to order a beer or wine instead? Basically I just really dislike the idea of paying more than a buck fifty for soda. K, 'nuff from me.",

You can tell it has been aged. .. it was pretty empty early afternoon.........No one greeted me actually 2 staff people walked right pass me without saying a word. Finally when asked for a menu a young man who looked to be the cook taking a break asked me if I was picking up or eating in.... Eating in. Take any seat and I'll get you a menu.... But maybe he meant someone else would get me a menu as I did not see him again... The manager John was real nice after some one messed up my order and had to re-fire another one. But blaming a new cook for the problem is not cool.... In addition the waitress who seemed to have her hands full with about 8 tables must have been having a bad day as her energy and the energy inside this restaurant was real low or rather non existent.... The waitress was not a greeter but only took your order no small talk no greeting.. then a few missteps along the way I like my dolmades not juicy and wrapped tightly I like to eat them like finger foods But here you need a fork to eat they were very watery and not wrapped correctly as they fell apart in my hands. Not sure what was up with the lemons but maybe restaurants should not put lemons on everything and in water unless customers ask for them.. from the lemon on the water I did not ask or to the lemon on the grape leaves I did not want to the excessive lemon juice on the appetizer.... I had a plate full of lemons I should not have had since I requested no lemons and received to many.....So far have not found a pita jungle which has outstanding service like the one on Shea in Scottsdale. ...... I guess when you are used to being treated amazingly you expect the same at their other locations but havent had that experience as of yet.  But hope to......",

I had Chicken Tikka Masala: grilled marinated all-natural chicken breast, coconut masala sauce, organic brown rice, sprouts. But to me it was a little bland. He brought out three different sauces, so I was able to bring the heat up a bit. It was good! I ate it all! The others had dessert. Gluten-free fudge brownie sundae. I didn't eat any, but they loved it. The prices are good for the amount of and quality of food. I would recommend a visit.",

On Wednesdays they have half price bottles of wine, Thursdays are live jazz nights, and they have reverse happy hour from 9pm-close with tons of small plates from $2-6.   On this particular night, we had an absolutely amazing server named Adan. Our first encounter with him was him asking if it would be alright if he brought our dog a water bowl. He continued to love on our pup each time he came by, and his energy and vibe are really cool. Somehow upbeat and super low key all at once. All of his recommendations were spot on, and at the end of the night he sent us home with complimentary teas and lemonades.   We were already Pita Jungle fans, but will be coming weekly just for Adin from now on!",

Well they changed the menu and changed ingredients.  Be warned that they changed not only presentation but the flavor of the dish when adding turmeric rice. I muddled through my first bowl because I didn't want to waste the food by sending it back. To give another chance I ordered again today under the advice that my server gave to specify it be made 'the old way' so I did and received the same nasty turmeric rice that completely kills the amazing garlic dip flavor. I called back to ask if this was an error and was told that 'sorry they will no longer have regular rice'. Very disappointed and most likely not going back.",

    "text": "I regularly order lunch for customers.  I had previously ordered from the Arcadia Pita Jungle location and decided that never again would I order from Pita Jungle.  This location changed my mind on that.   I called in around 9:30am for an 11:45 catering pick up.  Mark took the call and was awesome.  He helped me get everything set up and ready to go without question.  He didn't make me feel bad that I was calling late or anything.  He guided me on the menu in terms of specifics I needed for a customer who is Celiac and a customer who is Vegetarian.  He helped get a full spread for a very important meeting and made it easy.  I can't begin to describe how much I appreciate this when making sure that I get my customers with food preferences and allergies exactly what they need to enjoy a lunch meeting with me.   Side note - He did mention he was going to make sure I had everything I needed to feed the 15 people I was buying for.    I would like to shed some light on what a dramatic difference this was from working with the Arcadia location.  When calling into that location -   1. They told me at 9:30am when I called that they don't open until 10 and I would have to call back.  2. Upon calling back at 10 on the dot they told me that I would have to place a catering order only to be transferred and told catering orders need to be placed 24 hours in advance.  3. Then when telling them I was only feeding 8 and not totally understanding how a location of their size and reputation couldn't feed 8 people on such \"short\" notice (my pick up time was 12:45 calling in at 10am) but they would make an exception they then  4. forgot to put plates and silverware in the bags so when I got to my meeting my customers had no way of consuming the food and I had to leave to go buy the items.    I'm telling you the Chandler location with Mark handling these has got it figured out.  He made it easy, fun and quick.  He never made me feel bad about placing an order and he didn't not make me call back only to transfer me around a bunch.   Thank you Mark and the Chandler Pita Jungle Team for being a HUGE STEP above the Arcadia location!",

We were able to push two tables together for our group and the host was helpful in doing that. I wanted to take advantage of their stellar happy hour menu, so we ordered a few things from there. I got the black bean slider, hummus trio, Mediterranean olives and the chipotle chicken pizza on flatbread. Our server was good about reminding us to get our orders in before 6pm, much appreciated. My friends love their Mediterranean chicken salad, which looked delicious and I will think about getting another time.  The restaurant had a tropical vibe to it, and a nice view of the lake outside with a spacious patio for cooler weather. There was a gigantic mirror on one side, a bit much at first but then I forgot about it. The slider was tiny but good, loved the pizza, the olives were plentiful and salty, and the hummus trio was good, though I realize I prefer classic garlic over any other flavor. Overall a consistent spot with a variety of healthy options for everyone, friendly staff too.",

    "text": "This place has good tasting food and a nice lakefront patio that's good for spring/fall time, but the service is so consistently terrible that I couldn't recommend this place to anyone.  I've come here quite a few times now, as both a diner and a part-time driver for one of those side-gig food delivery services. As a dine-in customer, you should expect to wait a good 15-20 minutes after you finish your meal before someone comes out to the patio and you're able to ask for the check. It's annoying, but not necessarily a deal breaker.   However, if you order your food through Doordash/Grubhub/Uber Eats/etc, your driver will get a pickup-by time (which the restaurants are totally capable of managing on their tablet), and it's not atypical to arrive at this location and have to wait for 30-45 minutes before the food comes out of the kitchen. Today I came in and waited over 30 minutes (and 25 minutes over their pickup-by time) for a salad and drink, and the staff were completely unapologetic about it. It was a bad experience for both me and the end customer who got their food a half hour later than expected.  I would suggest the Ahwatukee location as an alternative, they have noticeably better service (though unfortunately their patio is next to a parking lot instead of a nice lake).",

The menu is pretty big, and you can customize every entre with different sides or sauces. Prices range from $7-$15 and portions are generous. They also have a killer happy hour with tapas and drinks starting at $2. My group ordered the antipasta appetizer sampler and would highly recommend it as it comes with 12 different treats to try and is a good size to share with 4 people. We also ordered gyros which were authentic, a chipotle black bean burger which was moist, the amazing California chicken lavish wrap, the burrito of the sea (heavy on the cabbage & not enough fish) and a few side orders. Besides the burrito of the sea, everything was beyond expectations. The kids meals here are also BEYOND- probably the best kids menu choices I have ever seen, the fruits, protein, vegetables and carbs can all be customized and chosen making it desirable for picky eaters. Overall this was a great dining experience and the total bill was less than $60 for the entire table! I would highly recommend pita jungle!",

    "text": "This is the most surreal experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I don't mean that in a good way, but in an \"is this really that bad?\" Twilight Zone kind of way. When we got there, we were considering going to Valle Luna which was next door, and we should have. We didn't make the right decision, and our noses were rubbed in that poor decision for approximately two hours.  We had a party of 6; three adults and 3 kids ranging from age 9 to 16. Four ordered sodas, but ended up with water because the soda machine was an enigma to the staff, and they could not figure out how to switch out empty to full. We ordered our food- 30 mins later I looked around the restaurant and NO ONE had food. It was bizarre. We decided to just try to pay for our drinks then go to the Mexican place next door, but the manager said that our stuff was almost done.  Everyone else there got their food at the same time and of course ours was last. My friend ordered a salmon burger- they were out of salmon burgers. She ended up ordering the salmon over potatoes or rice or something and she said it was good. My kids ordered the kids meals which they were not happy with due to being terribly bland, and the 16 year old got a pita that she liked. My husband got a Philly cheesesteak pita and he always gets the same thing, so no complaint there. I ordered the gyro bowl,(no pita), and it was good, except the extra avocado never made it to the plate but I was charged for it. When I first got it, it was cold, and I sent it back. It was then brought out on a hot plate but the food was still cold, and the hot plate was stacked on top of the original plate lol. At this point the experience was just unreal so I stopped expecting it to get better. It was like people who really didn't care about anything worked there or something. At one point my husband got sick of waiting for the Sriracha that he asked for so he went and got it himself. In the end, we were comped two desserts, which were very delicious, the soda machines were enabled again, and the kids got their sodas. They also gave us a couple of $10 gift cards which we used. I'm glad they realized how super crappy the whole time was. Two stars for that. We were there for a very long time and I felt like the old woman on the titanic when she says \"it's been 80 years...\" because that's how long it took for this place to get it together and get us our food tonight. I think that I don't ever feel like going back to pita jungle again, I have an aversion to it now. Kinda like that time I got super drunk on Absolute Citron when I was 18 and couldn't stand the smell of lemony things for about 15 years.",

I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted and my drink request taken. I was on a mission for the yellow fin salad but switched to the Mahi Mahi with pita chips because it came with jalapeno & cilantro hummus. It was a great dish! I saw lots of healthy eating going on, lots of veggies and salads. The one thing that I noticed was the floor of the open kitchen was a disaster....they were busy and the kitchen was jamming so I can understand it to a degree. If you have an open kitchen I think alittle more effort to keep it presentable should be taken.  I'll go back to this or one of the other locations to get my Mediterranean fix.",

    "text": "Having been to previous Pita Jungles, I decided to pass on the Mediterranean-inspired items such as the falafel, since I can get better tasting food of this type at say, Haji-Baba or Sahara.   I went here for lunch and tried the fish sandwich (Around $10). It was a nicely cooked, large piece of mahi-mahi with the requisite burger veggies (Tomatoes, lettuce, onions), with aioli. It was served with some garlicky roasted potatoes. The sandwich was pretty good, and was a large portion for lunch. The potatoes were really tasty, but be sure to either chew a lot of gum, eat a lot of mints, or brush your teeth afterwards because that garlic packs a punch on your breath!  Service was decent, and the locale is picturesque since it overlooks the lake. It gets quite busy here at lunch, so coming early will help you get in, eat, and get out in a decent amount of time.",

I fought him every step of the way because I'm SUPER picky with Mediterranean food. Well let me tell you, this was the best! I got the Mediterranean antipasti platter and it was the absolute best I've ever had. It was fresh, quick, and delicious. Falafel and dolma were outstanding. Great drink list too!!!   I do have one negative thing to say- and I hate to be that person, cause I truly loved the casual vibe- but the hostess was dressed so inappropriately and unprofessionally that it really left a bad taste in my mouth. Totally a friendly, cute girl, but her shorts were so short I could see her butt cheeks while she was taking us to our table and her cleavage and belly button ring didn't scream professionalism either. They should seriously consider some kind of dress code, as someone who's been in the restaurant business a number of years I couldn't believe that was okay!   Other than that little rant I can't speak highly enough of this lunch. Amazing!!!!",

I saw that salad sit on the counter a good 30 minutes before they brought it to me.  I also ordered the pepper hummus and it never came. I felt the need to sit outside because the the restaurant smelled like sewage.  I don't know if it was actual sewage or maybe just a dirty grease trap that hadn't been cleaned in a while.  It's unfortunate because the servers are quite friendly but the kitchen appears to be run by staff that pays no attention to food quality or customer care. When leaving the restaurant one of the kitchen staff was outside at the door on his cell phone, smoking.  I don't see myself returning to this location. It was a horrible disappointment.",

Like I said, I've been doing the jungle for years and have never had any problems with the food.  I hope I didn't just jinx myself.  **Update:  Went to Pita Jungle in Chandler today and sat on the patio.  They are on a little man made lake there and have a slight problem with ducks.  Don't get me wrong, I like these cute little guys.  But when I'm eating my lunch and there are five of them at my feet fighting over a pita, then a gust of wind comes and blows around duck feathers, that grosses me out.  Then I look down on the metal grated table and see some sort of bird poo in-between the grates that my silverware was just sitting on, ick.  We moved inside.  Maybe some tablecloths would help?  Oh and also the tables on the patio are packed in so tightly you have to squeeze to get through, and the next table is like 5 inches away, not cool.

OOOOHhhh ahhhh ooooh weh dumm di di day...(repeat).  So I am singing about the Jungle because after a baptism there is nothing better than emersing your flavor buds into the BEST cilantro -lime- jalepeno hummus around!      Ok...Maybe one thing better might be having the thickest tzatziki west of Athens and yummy beef wraps.    Our group had things ranging from spicy chicken pizza, to chicken salads of various sorts ( by the way... loads of chicken on the salads!) and spanikopita.  I wanted to give full marks but I felt that the service was a bit of a miss.  We had a large party and even though we asked for more roomy accommodations which were available... we were ignored blatently as they shoved all our orders onto a small space and pretended not to hear our request to add a table twice!!    Other than that, I noted that the server paid attention to refills very well and the service was certainly prompt.  They are assertive with posting the gratuity as the actual price on the initial bill....so if you don't look closely, you will have paid the tip twice. A- weema wak, a-weema wak  on that!",

I was happy when I saw it was roomy, had a great place to sit and eat outside, and there were actual servers that would bring you your food...a hot comodity in this town.  We sat down and it took our hipster server to come take our drink orders. My friend got the chai tea...they didn't have soy milk so I passed on that. We also ordered the garlic dip. I LOVE garlic so I thought the dip was awesome but my friend warned that chai and garlic are not a good combo.  I had the roasted veggie pita and it was SOOO good. It was super big so I had to use a knife and a fork. The brown rice inside was cooked perfectly! I could only eat half of it so I took the rest home which was a nice breakfast the next day.  Overall, I thought it was a good experience. All kind of people were there and it was the first time I saw some real diversity in Chandler, very cool. The staff was relaxed so if you go, you should relax. The prices were reasonable and you do get what you pay for. I like this joint and I definitley be returning.",

There's a very large framed mirror hanging on one of the walls, and the other walls are decorated with art by local artists (for sale).  In nicer weather it's nice to chill outside on the patio next to the \"lake.\"  My favorites are the cilantro-jalepeno hummus, garlic potatoes, lentil fattoush salad (the best dang dish on the menu!), and one thousand beans.  The veggie wraps and falafels are also good choices.",

Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of \"man food\".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalapeno or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)",

It's too bad that a lot of their prices have gone up (as have other restaurants) but I'll still patronize this place. Read as: some things went up in price almost two dollars, but you can still have a meal and a drink for around $10, more or less, depending on what you order. I definitely like this place over the new one across MCC on Southern - there's something about being by the lake that makes it special. Even if there are stinky ducks there from time to time. ;)  Ooh - and the gambas con ajos is my favorite appetizer! :)",

There are very different vibes based on the location though. tempe location is pretty hipster while the gilbert one is great to bring your kids too. I mean that makes sense right. The chandler location is on a lake which is nice for dates. So lets get to the food, and lets start with the hummus. All flavors are delicious. The jalepano cliantro is the best. For lunch sometimes I get the hummus with chicken its a great lunch! There portions are huge any pasta and salad your going to end up taking home. lentil fatoosh salad is AMAZING. I was actually nicknamed \"the fatoosh\" for a while because it was all I ate for a summer. anywaysssss after that the pasta salad is great! the 1000 beans is good. the lavash wraps are great I mean they are all pretty good. If you can get there for their happy hour its a great deal. small plates or tapas for around $2 a piece and they are great for the after work munchies. Beer selection is not that great though. hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!",

The second time, things weren't right and somethings were terrible.  I've tried several varieties of the hummus and they're all good. The mediterranean plate is very good, except for the falafel which resemble hockey pucks. The spicy chicken pita wrap was alright.  It wasn't very spicy.  It was enormous and couldn't be eaten by picking it up (structural integrity problems). The chicken was all on one half of the pita wrap.   The fish was terrible, definitely not a recommend.  The spicy chicken hummus plate was good. The black bean burger was great. The kafta burger was great.  The chipotle black bean burger was not good -- mushy and the cranberries were weird.  I would normally give this a 2 star rating, but because it is one of the best fresh and healthy restaurants in the Phoenix area, I'll bump it up to a 3 star.",

    "text": "I was super excited to find this location here, right in my own neighborhood! I'd been to the Tempe location many times, but that's a bit of a drive for the every day dinner.  And it turns out, I like this location so much more!  Parking is rough most of the time, but if we don't luck out and get a reasonable spot, we'll park on the other side of the lot and take a walk.  Inside is ever-changing art hanging on the walls, Greek/modern decor, and a lovely view of the duck pond there on Ray and Dobson.  We have yet to make it out on the patio, but in good weather, I bet that's perfect.    I've always liked Pita Jungle's food, but that's because I am not vegetarian.  I enjoy healthy food, but I do need meat.  This explains why my vegan friends aren't quite as taken by PJs as I am.  I love the Chicken del Sol, which is a southwest spin on a greek stew sort of dish.  The cheesy pita wedges around the edge give the presentation of a sun, and are delicious to dip in the broth.  The chicken is just spicy enough that I enjoy it.  Lately, my boyfriend and I have been going just to split an appetizer; the chicken and hummus trifecta.  That's not what it's called on the menu, but that's how I remember it.  It's offered as one of three different kinds of hummus with chopped chicken and pita, but don't be afraid to ask for all three varieties.  If you must choose just one, the red pepper hummus is the best.  With an extra pita and some of their fresh lemonade, the two of us walk out completely satisfied.  Service has always been very friendly, and I appreciate that they always offer (or just provide without warning) an extra beverage for the road.  Their lemonade is so good I can't turn that down.  I'll definitely continue frequenting this Pita Jungle!",

The location is great it is very cool and inviting inside and overlooks a lake so thats always nice. They have a cool looking bar and interesting artwork. I tried 3 different plates so far and all were delicious they tasted fresh and were very flavorful. The only thing i recommend is not having their \"teas\". These are just water with some food coloring and absolutely no flavor!! (Very disappointing). The only reason this place is getting three stars is because the service was pretty bad. No one ever greets you here they just kind of look at you like they wish you were not there and then seat you like they are doing you a huge favor.  On my recent visit our server was very uninterested in serving. She seemed irritated when we were not ready to order and then retaliated by ignoring us for the next ten minutes or so. She kept walking by us and pretending not to see us so I finally called out to her and she just put her hand up and said \"give me a couple minutes!\" I do my very best not to piss off people who are handling my food so I just waited. She never apologized for taking so long and did not check up on us except to refill my nasty tea which she spilled and did not clean up :o  I think I might go again because the food is so good but it would be really great if I were welcomed by a friendly staff and treated as a customer not as though I'm asking for favors. Please train your staff to be polite and friendly or just get rid of the bad seeds and this restaurant will do so much better",

Local art work adorn the walls and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Start with the Hummus trio ( it's not listed on the menu but it's a plate with each hummus on it so you can experience every one) The cilantro Jalapeno hummus is heavily addictive. In fact, I'm gettin hot and bothered talking about it so... I digress.   The Greek salad is super yummy to start with, and the wraps are heavenly. Lavosh Shawarma wrap is a customer favorite and the California beach club *with chicken* instead of turkey is super fresh and chalk-o-block full of goodness. If you wanna keep it more traditional, the Beef Gyro is even more delicious when accompanied by Sriracha sauce.   I go here all the time and love this place more and more with every visit. Eat well, live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers",

Unfortunately this location does not live up to the quality we expect from the franchise.   As vegans we have limited options in dining out and Pita Jungle has built a strong reputation as a company that caters to vegans and vegetarians alike. But not at this location.   Back in the spring we ordered take out only to find pieces of chicken mixed in with our tofu - I talked with Christina the GM and she assured us it was an \"anomaly\" and couldn't happen again. Still we avoided this location for 6 months hoping the problem would get resolved over time. It didn't - we went back again last month and I ordered a veggie garden wrap only to once again find pieces of chicken mixed into this vegan dish.   This time I took pictures and sent them to Christina and the local manager Mary - they completely ignored my emails so I posted them to their facebook page. And once again they claim it is an anomaly. Reading other yelp reviews it seems like this recurring anomaly is now the norm at this location. So we avoid it like the plague.",

This location is the most scenic of the chain with a water front patio. The menu is the same as the other locations. The really inconsistency of the items on the menu. One of my frequent items is the veggie wrap, Some days it is vibrant with canalized onions and a strong taste of garlic, other days I need to use a pint of siracha to give it flavor.   Alternatively for a lighter, cheaper meal I opt for the falafel pita, the falafel itself is one of the better ones in Arizona but still far from the best I ever had in Haifa, The pita is chewy and fresh and there is ample tahini and salad to fill the pita.   I recommend this place for a lunch, or dinner on the patio. Occasionally on weekends there is live music inside which can make conversation a bit difficult.   Parking in this strip mall can be a bit tight too.",

    "text": "Early on, Pita Jungle was a good place to eat (when there was 1 or two locations).  However, over the past 4 years (at least) the quality of your food has been rapidly declining.  I have consistently, over the course of the past few years, gone to your location in chandler. And, I have consistently seen the quality of your food decline.  Simply put, your food sucks. It is HIGHLY inconsistent.  I can never expect to get consistent food from your establishment (especially Chandler).  On numerous occasions I have ordered food, just to have to call and complain to this location due to the quality of the dish.  Specifically, the spicy chicken wrap.  At times, I will get food that is cold, under cooked, doesn't have any flavor, and is just completely different each time.  I have complained, and upon taking with a \"manager\", I am assured that it won't happen again and that they will reverse charges and I will be given a complimentary meal.  However, I don't wish to have a complimentary meal or have my charges reversed - I expect to get quality food.  After the last time, I promised myself that I would not go to your establishment again - because your food is not quality and I do not wish to take a chance at getting sick from your food.  I can say that the \"chefs\" you have hired at this location either don't know how to cook, or they do not care about their job.  As a result, it has diminished your brand significantly.  I have been a patron of your establishment since the beginning - NO MORE!  Although I told myself that I would not eat your food anymore, I decided to give your brand one more shot last week.  Much to my surprise, the food was actually better than it had been in the past. Not like it was in the beginning, but better.  So, tonight I decided to try it again.  As I am eating my food, I keep noticing a NASTY, RANCID, and FISHY smell coming from my food.  I picked up a piece of broccoli that I was eating and smelled it - NO FISHY SMELL. So, I figured my mind was playing tricks on me and I keep eating.  Again, I smell fish but I can't tell where its coming from. The smell I am describing is not pleasant fish smell - IT IS A RANCID FISHY SMELL.  Anyone who eats fish knows - if it smells fishy, it should definitely be avoided!  Then after (almost) eating my entire dish, I spot what looks like a piece of BARK from a tree.  Upon closer inspection, I can clearly see that it is a chunk of fish skin.  Then, I begin inspecting the remainder of my dish and notice and EVEN BIGGER chunk of FISH SKIN.  Then, I decide to smell it to verify that I am seeing what I think I'm seeing.  THE RESULTING SMELL IS BEYOND WORDS!  It smelled EXACTLY like ROTTING FISH. ROTTING FISH!  This is the FINAL STRAW!  Where once your food was good in my mind, it will forever be etched in my mind how I ate an entire dish only to find ROTTING, RANCID, FISH SKIN (AND OTHER FISH PARTS) in my food.  It didn't take long before I was in the bathroom VOMITING your disgusting excuse for food.",

Within the last 2 months when me and my fiance have come in our service was horrible. Our waiter took too long to come to our table, I had to order iced tea 3 times, water twice for my fiance. They kept forgetting to bring us our beverages & it was annoying. Our food was slight warm and our waiter never checked on us both times we came in. We decided if we ever want Pita Jungle, we'll be taking it to go. The staff has completely changed and I don't see the regular awesome waitresses they used to have. I hope it changes back to the way it was when it gad awesome service and a great wait staff.",

I have had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad my last couple of visits and it is really good. Their passion tea is always my drink of choice.  Have been going to Pita Jungle for years now and typically dine at the Chandler location. I have had Bo for a food server mulitple times and he is awesome!!! Today I decided to request him because I really like the level of service that he provdes and he is playful and fun. He has many attributes that really set him apart. You can tell when people like what they do and are very customer service oriented. It is always refreshing to see this. I will continue to ask for Bo. He is a super cool chill guy and on point with keeping the customer happy.",

The name says pita jungle, but with their avocado hummus, they served subpar tortilla chips. So we ordered a side of pita bread, which came out whole instead of cut up nicely, and was quite tasteless and flat. You would think it would be their specialty since it's in the name. I spit out my bite of the salmon burger, and the side of potatoes should have never left the kitchen. The grilled vegetable lavash was also disappointing- the wrap was hard and dry, and the veggies were okay but they were smothered in garlic mash potatoes. I wouldn't have ordered it had I known there wouldn't be more fresh veggies. Never going back.",

Unfortunately we had a clear view of the kitchen which made it difficult to order food (see photos) I'd like to say the view changed but it only grew worse. At one point the guy preparing the salad mashed down the trash with his food prep gloves on and then continued to make salads : (   We have always loved the other pita jungles we  went to and I sincerely hope this was just a rare occurrence.   What appeared to us to be the manager (as he mentioned being shorted on the alcohol that he had ordered) walked past this area of the kitchen more than once & didn't seem to give it a second thought. However we did notice (just as we were closing out) that someone did come in and start to sweep the kitchen. So it is quite possible that he said something to them off to the side and they begin to address the issue after we left.",

What wins me over about Pita Jungle is their consistency with delicious food and the friendly servers.  The experience yesterday could have been a bad one, but because they were so attentive and thankful for my patience,  my overall experience was pretty good. I called in a to go order around 10:30 am and asked for it to be ready by 11:40. I arrived at 11:45 and the order was not ready. Not only was it not ready, I didn't get my order until after 12:00 pm. Two people were helping me,  I hate that I didn't get their names so they can receive kudos, and they kept me posted on the order, they were super apologetic and explained why there was a delay, they walked the food to my car and helped me check the order. I was super impressed with how they handled this situation and even though my order was late, i am more than happy to order from this location again due to the excellent service and quality food!!!",

    "text": "I hope someone else writes a review about this because 'I swear I am not making this up.'  I normally like the pita jungles I have been to (Mesa, Gilbert), and I have had 1 good experience at this Chandler location.  However, today I had lunch with a friend and we sat on the normally quite pleasant pation. Now maybe you won't believe this, but midway through lunch 2 men working on the patio started a chain saw fewer than 12 feet away from us.  Okay, it stopped after about a minute, only to be followed by more chain saw noise a few moments later.  This was followed by an electric sander and pounding.   Please understand that this was not at 3AM or 9PM or some awkward time.  This was at 1:45 lunch time.    We cut our lunch short and decided to leave.  But before leaving we contacted the manager and complained about the noise.  His reaction?  Well, I can't control that.  Corporate sent the crew out and I have nothing to say about when they work.  And the hostess should have asked how everything was.  And then, 'we had to do the work because someone got hit by the post that was there...' and on and on.  This manager blamed everyone else for the problem--the hostess, corporate, and even insinuated it was our fault for not saying something.  Well, sir, you are the manager and the buck stops with you.   You could have at least approached the tables that were out there and offered to reseat customers inside the restaurant.   And as to your claim that you were not aware that customers were being disturbed?   Really.   IT WAS A CHAINSAW.   It made a noise!   It made A LOT of noise!   Noise that was followed by sanding and pounding.  You sir, need to be re-educated.  Get a clue about how to handle odd situations --of which I am sure there will be more.  And, learn how to say, \"I am sorry for the inconvenience.  I understand how frustrating that must have been.\" As it is, I found your response unbelievably inadequate.",

Some of my favorites:  The Gyro: a better tasting gyro here than what I've experienced elsewhere. The marinated lamb/beef combo works well and it's my regular go-to.  Mediterranean Chicken Salad: this is one amazing salad. Order this one only if you have a large appetite. I can put down a lot of food, but the portion size of this one even challenges me. Grilled chicken, tomatoes, onions, roasted bell peppers, cilantro, pine nuts, cucumbers, corn, raisins and taboule over mixed greens with feta cheese and lemon vinaigrette. Yum.  Mahi Mahi w/Pita Chips: a recent favorite. Wood-fired Mahi Mahi served with cilantro-jalapeno hummus. Served with pea sprouts, pico de Gallo and pine nuts along with pita chips. Amazing flavors.  Service here has always been good. A shout out to our server Donna, who really stays on top of everything and always ensures we get \"to go\" ice tea's!",

It didn't have that sparkle it usually has. Our food for two of us took nearly 30 min to get to us. And it just tasted ok. The seared ahi tuna was on the salty side  (on hummus appetizer) and the med. wrap was haphazardly put together and a little soggy. While the Taboule salad was too watered down and again haphazardly placed on the plate. The service is however excellent and very nice. When we found something unexpected in our app. They immediately changed it out for us, apologized and also took it off our bill. Just a little more TLC on the restaurant atmosphere and food structure and presentation would be give so much more high marks.",

Opening our delivery bag we realized the store had forgotten to put the pita bread in for our appetizer. Impossible to eat without! We didn't have any crackers so we called to get a refund for the dish as we couldn't eat it. We were transferred to the manager who offered us a free entree but hey what we wanted was a refund as the appetizer tray was over $13. He actually came and delivered the pita bread and gave us a coupon for a free entree. That is real customer service and he should be applauded for this.  And the food was awesome too. We will be back!",

Nice atmosphere, alright service, and great, great food; left something off the plate but, I still wish there was one back home.  Had some sort of great version of spanakopita as in traditional Greek food, but this was amazingly puffy and light.  I'm in NY and wouldnt think twice about coming here again; Enough said.",

    "text": "Its a Friday early in the evening and we decide to go to Pita Jungle. Good fresh healthy food. We walk in and its not too crowded. Pretty clean as always. We are seated right away and are asked about drinks. We order them and start glancing at the menu. I must say I do love the new happy hour menu. Awesome small plates that are really affordable of some of the best hummus and garlic dip and other great stuff. We get our drinks and then the waitress takes our order. I order a happy hour garlic dip and the Gyro. My husband gets the tuna with hummus. She leaves us and we wait.   It starts to get more crowded. Another four sets of couples come in while we are waiting and talking. We are still waiting. All the other tables are getting their drinks and ordering. Still waiting. Then the other tables start getting their food. Wait, what? We got here almost 15 minutes before those guys. How come they got their food? Ok. Still waiting. Another set gets all their food. Mmmkay. Our waitress comes over and offers us refills. Says food will be out soon. So now I see everyone that arrived after we did eating happily with huge plates of food. Bummer. I wonder why we were ignored and put last? We were very nice and polite. We showered. We weren't dressed bad. However, we are not your \"normal\" looking couple. Maybe that is it. Hmmmmm...  Food finally comes. I get the garlic dip. Husband gets the hummus. He gets his pita for the hummus. Wait, don't I get at least one pita? The waitress huffs and goes and checks on that. So I grab my husbands plate of pita. I rip one apart and it snaps like a cracker. What the? Its toasted solid. Not soft, but hard with crisp black edges. My husband didn't mind it but I did. So I pick around the softer center part to enjoy my garlic dip. Then the main plate of the Gyro arrives. And they gave me a small plate of little pita for the dip. Cold and un-warmed, but I was glad it was not burnt. We finish the garlic dip and I start on my Gyro. Three bites in I get a serious crunch. Then this awful taste in my mouth. The lamb inside the gyro is burnt. Burnt to a nasty charred crisp. Since I already ate 1/3 of it (it was all veggies and this was my first bite of the meat) I politely asked for a box. We pay and leave. Not very happy.   To sum up, bad service. Burnt or un-warmed food. Good garlic dip. They highly need to fix some service and cooking issues before we return again if ever.",

They have a nice patio out in the back and plenty of tables inside. Weekends they have live bands come in to entertain the crowd. \"Do I not entertain you??\" Just kidding.... No Braveheart here but had to throw that in there!!   Anyway, my favorites:  Starters: grilled chicken and hummus. You can have this to dine in or as a good to go order. And you can even have this as an entree because it is that good. You'll have the regular hummus with an olive and a couple cucumber circles.   Featured Specials: Mahi Mahi entree. \"Instead of the Mahi Mahi can I just have one Mahi?\" Sound familiar? Comes on a bed pea sprouts greens, 4 small crunchy paprika looking sprinkled pita chips, and a nice creamy green sauce. Spritz it with lemon. Delicious!   Healthy Burger: chipotle black bean burger. House made black bean burger (made with corn, cranberries, garlic, onion, carrots, oats, variety of peppers) with onions, tomato, pea sprouts, and a side of garlic potato.   Happy Hour: drafts are a couple dollars. White or red Sangria $3. Margaritas, mimosas, martini, cocktails are also on special. Tapas style starters such as falafel, grilled lemon chicken, mussels, hummus and pita are $3 and under. $5.99 for the mix of 3 of the following: chicken slider, beef slider, chicken paco or ribeye paco (pita transformed as the taco shell). Otherwise they are $2.50 each. Happy is from 3-6pm or 9pm to close.   A place to eat, enjoy, and entertain. See you there!",

I'm not the type to leave a review of a restaurant even if the experience wasn't good, I just don't return, but I felt compelled to bring attention to my latest experience that happened today.  I noticed it was warm upon coming in, but then became more apparent when the young man who delivered my lunch was drenched in sweat and looked visibly uncomfortable.  Now being a resident of AZ for the past 25+ years, I understand it's hot, especially in the summer months, but this makes me wonder how a successful restaurant wouldn't strive to keep customers and employees alike, happy and coming back and have an enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Pita Jungle is usually a favorite of mine until my last experience. I came in on a Wed at 5pm and first thing after being asked \"how many\", if I'ld like to eat at the bar. I am a mature lady and told the gal that I wasn't much inclined to eating at a bar. When we entered the dining room there were all kinds of tables available. Usually the bar is offered when they are full and don't have any empty tables.  Sorry folks but first come, first served. The manager and his staff aught to realize this. Not try to accommodate a 2 top that hasn't even arrived!  Everything seemed rushed. My chicken Shrwarma bowl was delicious as always. However I was given my check after I'ld only had a few bites. Another signal to get moving. I don't blame my waitress as she was very sweet although I was never checked on to see if everything was fine. This attitude comes from management. Because I got a visit from him after my plate was empty. It wasn't genuine concern if I had a great experience and again felt like the bums rush outta there!  It seemed if your a lone dinner here you were not as valued as a larger party. The management needs to realize our dollars have just as much spending power as any other customer. Waitstaff...we usually tip better than most because we don't have the added expense of paying for a family.  I usually go to the Pita Jungle west of I10 on Ray Road and have never felt rushed to eat and leave. Perhaps because it's a much larger dining room.   I've also frequented PJ in Tempe and in Phoenix on Indian School Road. As mentioned before it's usually a favorite spot.",

I Went to Pita Jungle for my first time, I order a diet coke, I took a couple of sips and then noticed that whole inside of the cup was covered in a thick grimy film.

I'm not talking a little bit of residue here folks I'm talking Scum Build Up from Hell!!   I wish I hadn't ordered already.  I take my glass up to the counter and ask to get a new soda in a  To-Go cup.  Once I sit back down I start looking around at other peoples cups and notice the same Funk caked up inside them as well and they are greedily sipping along without even using a straw..EEEEEEWWWWW So this was not an isolated incident.  How do you not notice that, Please tell me, How do you not feel it touch your lips......(shudders)....  As I sit waiting for my food, Dear God, I can only imaging what kind of filth lies behind the counter where no-one can see if this(cup grime) is the kind of stuff they are serving up right under our noses.  I begin to look around and notice that the cups are not the only thing with the foul gunk build up......the tables too.....Oh God I'm watching a woman let her baby eat right off of the filthy thing!  My Food arrives, The glazed Chicken pizza (see pics) ......do I eat.....it looks good.....smells good....... Well It actually tasted Delicious, Unfortunately I could not eat anymore than a couple bites as I was so disgusted with the filth of this place.  I had to rush right home and shower!  1 star because of the Scuzz factor  Are all Pita Jungles this repulsive?  if not please tell me which one is CLEAN!   I will never return to this location",

The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.  Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.    Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.  The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!  Aside from that, I dig this place.",

    "text": "Probably the BEST THING I EVER ATE was from here! I stumbled upon Pita Jungle from a review on the tempe bikram yoga website--I tried it out & OMG.  TO DIE FOR.  I had seared ahi w/ hummus ($12ish) It was amazing! Perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth seared ahi, atop a bed of amazing hummus!---with warm pita bread. It honestly was the best thing I ever ate! Would totally recommend this to anybody who loves ahi or hummus!  I came again & had Red Quinoa Salad on special & it was super yummy! $7 for huge plate of greens, quinoa, tomatoes and of course hummus!! Totally split-able & filling.   Great craft cocktails & speciality ice teas as well. We love the patio & often come before a movie (theater next door) or after a good workout",

    "text": "Love Pita Jungle!   Quick fix for Mediterranean and middle eastern food with a relaxing environment and very accommodating and friendly service. Have any special requests or concerns about ingredients? No problem! The servers know their food and the chefs are able to make adjustments as needed. The owners are usually there, and the food and service never fall short.  There is always something on the menu to try, and their daily specials offer new experiences that keep you coming back for more.  Hummus is just right (try the cilantro-jalepeno hummus), baba ganoosh is my favorite dip, and they do falafel crispy, light, and full of spice.  Salmon, Mahi Mahi, Chicken combo, Chicken Del Sol... they're all great! The side of beans is warm and comforting, and the light and fluffy garlic dip goes great with the chicken. We always get the tabouli (taboule), and usually always get more to-go.  Mediterranean Platter serves great as an appetizer to split. Lavosh Pizza is light, crisp, and is packed with flavor. Whether you want a salad, a wrap, a healthy burger,  a larger entree, or all of the above, Pita Jungle is the right place to try authentic and healthy food.  Frequently used for carry-out, Pita Jungle serves large portions at great prices.  This location has outdoor seating and also has a live band play at some point during the week. Artwork on the wall is for sale to support your community, and a full bar is available for those special occasions.",

Because I do not eat  Wheat  they graciously substitute Brown rice.  As soon as they serve Wheat Free wraps I will come more often.    1949 W. Ray Rd. was the closest location.  Recently a location opened at 4921 E. Ray Rd. only 6 minutes from my house.  OH Happy Pita Jungle day.    Servers are pleasant, accomodating and efficient.

We started off splitting a hummus and pita appetizer.  It was delicious!  Great texture, beautiful amounts of garlic with cucumber and tomato slices on the side to go with the pitas.  My friends raved about the gyros (seemed a bit odd to me that they had lettuce but, they did not complain.)  I got the beef philly pita, being a rebel.  It was a bit juicier than I expected, and I have had better but I enjoyed it more than I expected.  The staff was reasonably fast despite it being a rather packed house and was unfailingly nice.  Not many places would be that busy yet that fast and pleasant.    If I was a bit more in love with the Philly, I might have given 5 stars but I will very much consider going back some time in the future.  Very much a place to go with friends!",

The last time I was here, I branched out and got the pesto pizza. Basically, it was a pita with pesto, a bunch of raw, barely cut up veggies (including an entire mushroom), and cheese, just melted for a moment. I was unimpressed.  Luckily, it wasn't my first time. Their gazpacho, tomato and red lentil soups are all amazing, and my favorite is the spinach feta quesadilla. Best quesadilla I've ever had. The iced tea is delicious, they're quick to refill, and will often offer you a travel cup to go.  Service, while a bit slow, is very friendly, and I love the number of vegetarian options.  Price point can be a bit high, but the food is good quality, and except the pita pizza, it is DELICIOUS. Looking forward to being a continuous customer.",

    "text": "I've been eating here for years since moving to AZ in '03, although it's been at least a year since I've visited this PJ location.  The hummus served here is one of the three best I've tried in the area (the other two were Sabuddy's (RIP) and Persian Room (nothing close to the first two, though).  It's been awhile since I had hummus (*allergy), but I seem to recall liking Persian Garden's, as well.  But I digress...  Tried the smoked salmon wrap, and the mussels (a seafood special).  Also liked the hummus w/ chicken, w/c came with a couple of tomato wedges.  Would've liked a bit more!  Didn't like how they charge for extra pitas.  Curried chicken and potato lavosh is pretty tasty!  Liked their black bean burger, but it's been so long since I tried it that I cannot comment on whether it's house-made, or just a frozen patty from a major distributor.  All I can say that it was muy delicioso!  Spanakopita app was good, but portions were small.  Ooh, try the red bell pepper hummus... delicious!!  If you don't mind spicy, the jalapeno hummus isn't bad.    Desserts tend to be good, too.  Tried a raspberry cheesecake that was particularly flavorful and silky-smooth, and the vegan carob peanut butter shake (made w/ frozen yogurt), w/c, at the time, was only available at the Tempe location, was a treat on many levels!  I inquired if Chandler's were vegan, as well, but they're not (chocolate syrup), so I didn't try.  Jazz on Thursdays was cool, but the belly dancer I saw on a Saturday was very much a beginner...  She seemed very nervous.  I hope she continued with it and is now enjoying success.",

While its as flavorful and great as everywhere else here they are by far the most stingy in the amount they give you.  I once asked during a takeout order why it was so small (i ordered a large like always) and the explanation was \"a large is just supposed to cover the bottom of the container\" and that was exactly what I got.  Imagine taking a paintbrush and spreading it along the bottom so that it appears there is more.  I'm talking millimeters here.  Every single other location gives double what they do here, and when I brought it up I got nothing but attitude.  Wont be visiting this location again.",

    "text": "At this point, I think I've tried just about all the vegan options at Pita Jungle and while they are not great, they are better than nothing.   The falafel pita is probably your best bet and perhaps the spinach pasta salad some in 2nd. The falafel platter has a strange, strange presentation. Rather than serving the falafels with sauce and veggies on the side, they serve it up like a big salad. A big salad is not an appetizer, it's an entree. And by big, I mean BIG. Only about 5 or 6 falafels, but a ton of greens. The grilled veggie burrito doesn't have very great flavor. A lot of ginger, but not much of anything else. The thing that bothered me most about this item was that they rolled the foil *into* my burrito. So, the only way I could eat the thing was by tearing the burrito apart and trying to remove the foil from my food. This resulted in a mess. Fix this, Pita Jungle. It also bums me that the vegan options are so meager. If they just offered vegan bread and lavosh I'd be able to try more of the items. I'd love the portabello burger or the veggie burger. Alas, dairy.  At least I can say that the P.J. staff is very attentive and friendly. The wine menu is good, you have waterfront-ish dining and on Thursday nights they have live jazz.",

I had the gyro today and it was absolutely wonderful, beautiful complimentary flavours and a perfect portion.  Check out their website for nutritional info on each item, the beef gyro in this case had about 1800 mg of sodium but it was worth it.  Def reccomend, I keep going here with friends.

Last time, it was missing the cucumbers. My boyfriend always gets a side of garlic new potatoes and it has become a joke each time we pick up to see what type of container and what size they will be. We always pay the same price, but sometimes the order of potatoes is at least half the size it was the time before. Of course all of this is more frustrating because you dont realize these things until you get home. The last thing you want to do is drive all the way back to the restaraunt.  At least there are plenty of other locations to choose from because this one needs a lot of work!",

    "text": "This is one of the many Pita Jungle restaurants in the area which you can consider as a type of warning. My fiance and I went there for an anniversary dinner on a Friday night. The place was pretty full and a live jazz band was playing. After 10 minute wait we were seated. The hostess got us drinks and after than we received zero service from any of the staff. We had two waitresses circling around and making sure to avoid any eye contact. People that came 10 minutes after us were getting their food orders in before anyone even spoke to us. After 15 minutes of that, we left. The hostess was nice enough to not accept our money for the drinks, consider that's where the 1 star comes from.  THE FOOD  No idea. Two waitresses circled around us for 15 minutes making sure to avoid any eye contact.   The menu is the same as any other one of these restaurants.  SETTING  Same setup as all the other Pita Jungle restaurants. Staff sucks, except for the hostess.  OVERALL: Will never be back to this location again and will not recommend anyone else to go there. Instead, I would recommend the Mesa location since it has a much better service, as in, they actually provide it.",

    "text": "Awesome job Chandler pita jungle. about a week or so ago I called in an order and arrived about 15 minutes later and they couldn't find my food. The girl said she had but then it was gone... Had to wait. Tonight I called in my order and arrived 15 minutes later and there was a couple placing an order. I then paid for my order, then a young lady placed an order. As I waited an additional 15 minutes, the couple AND the young lady were given their orders. Finally I was given my order and when I asked why I received mine after both of them I was told, \"our saute guy is really backed up.\" So I was angry at this excuse as it sounded ridiculous so I just took my order and left, figuring I would just not return to pita jungle, as this was the second time in a row your restaurant disappointed me. Then I arrived at home and when I opened my order, My sandwich was made incorrectly from how I ordered it. I called and of course the only solution to this is for ME to go back to the restaurant and have it replaced, however this was not an option since I had already spent more time than I wanted to get a quick dinner for my wife and I as we wanted to watch the Coyotes game while we ate. Based on these experiences, I will not return to Pita Jungle.  I thought I would update this review. I sent an email to the company and within 20 minutes, both the store director AND the operations director responded. It is customer service like this to show their concern that WILL bring me back to Pita Jungle in the future, especially since we really love the food.",

    "text": "I would say that I prefer the Mesa location simply because it tends to be quieter but this one is within walking distance for me so it's often the one I go to.  Plus I like sitting out out by the lake when the temperature finally becomes reasonable.  I was reading the previous reviews and a lot of people have had problems with the service but I've never had anything but wonderful service here.  I've eaten here during busy and slow times and the service has always been pretty consistant.  The food is excellent and, I think, appropriately priced.  I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?",

    "text": "You'd think it hard for a granola, earthy/crunchy place like this to provide a consistent experience across locations. But I've been to three in the Valley, and they've all be on par with another.  But this one is my \"home town\" PJ, so I'll review it. My wife is a veggie, so this has become a standard of ours. Plenty of grilled flesh for me and Firstborn, and lots of \"no-mom\" items for her.  Yes, it's busy. Yes, it's crowded. You'll have a hard time telling your wait staff from the patrons. But that's part of the atmosphere. The food has always been tasty. The service always fast enough. And the price isn't crazy.",

    "text": "Good place for casual lunch here in Chandler. Location in a strip mall can be a bit of turnoff.   The hummus is delicious. A large plate is enough for four people to share. Sandwiches & salads are huge!  Always have plenty for leftovers for the next day. Never tried their bar but it was certainly busy for a Saturday afternoon.   I think they could expand their patio a little bit, but otherwise an okay place to eat here in Chandler.",

My mom had the tuna, she liked it.    We also had hummus, pretty good.  Not THAT great.  This place is a little too pricey for what you get and it was LOUD in there.  Oh and no drinks?  Just beer and wine.  Grrr.",

    "text": "Mmm... Pita Jungle. I had been craving it all week and finally my lunch buddies decided they wanted to go. This location is BUSY at lunch time; full of corporate type as well as families with children (bad idea to bring kids at lunchtime, it's just WAY too packed). Yesterday we were seated at the bar. I was kind of irritated (only mildly) because when we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and a guy I assume to be an owner or a \"big wig\". The \"big wig\" looked us up and down like we didn't really belong in the place, I really don't know what that was all about. So I asked if we could sit at the bar, we were initially told there was no room, but then an employee that was sitting at the bar decided to move to let us sit (duh). So that little irritation aside, we were seated and greeted again by a very nice bartender/server. I mentioned that I was STARVING and ordered the pita burrito, the bartender asked me if I've ever had the Medchilada. I said no, she said \"Oh you must try it, it's full of beans and you can add chicken.\" PERFECT. After a very short wait, our orders arrived. My friend had the Philly Chicken Pita and the other had the broiled chicken pita. EVERYONE was in pita heaven! My food was so flavorful! The chicken was moist and tender, there were about 3 different beans in the dish. I don't usually eat brown rice because it tends to be crunchy or too grainy, Pita Jungle has managed to make brown rice moist and enjoyable! very nice! The only thing I would change about my food is that it had A TON of chicken in it and it almost overwhelmed the dish. Pita Jungle is and will remain one of my favorite \"long lunch\" spots!",

    "text": "While the Tempe Pita Jungle will always be my favorite, I can't help but appreciate the different atmosphere of its sister location in Chandler. The restaurant is large AND offers a bar. During the day, it attracts more of a family atmosphere along with young professionals on their lunch break.  It's more of a hot date spot at night. It does overlook a lake, which makes it a bit romantical.  You'll find all the usual suspects on the menu. Be sure to try the Roasted Pepper Hummus, the Pesto Pizza or the Pita Pizza for some deliciousness.  BIG NEWS: There's a new Pita Jungle opening in Mesa, across from Mesa Community College, in December.",

    "text": "I probably first started going to this Pita Jungle in 2001 or 2002. For the longest time there were only two Pita Jungle restaurants in The Valley. The other location was in Tempe on Apache Rd. Since 2005, they've just boomed all over the place.  I love Mediterranean food. It's healthy, delicious and exotic. The Pita Jungle introduced me to it and I will forever be greatful. One dish that this particular Pita Jungle serves that I haven't seen in their other locations is a lamb shank dish. Now I haven't been to this particular location for a year or two so I'm not sure if they actually still serve it. Lamb is a pricey dish so I don't always get to enjoy it. Whenever I get a chance to visit this location, I never fail to order it. It's tender, tasty and the meat easily pulls from the bone.   Another great feature at this location is the lake located at the back of the restaurant. It makes for a great view while you either sit by the window or in the patio. Whenever you finish your meal, you can walk it off on the paved trail surrounding the man-made lake or visit the other stores and restaurants that do business next to it.",
