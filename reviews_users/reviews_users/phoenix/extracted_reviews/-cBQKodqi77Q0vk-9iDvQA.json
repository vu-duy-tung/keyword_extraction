    "text": "Stopped in on Saturday for some pre-gaming before the ASU vs. Wisconsin game. We have been here a few times before but never on a Football Saturday.   It was about half-full when we got there but by the time we got our drinks the bar was filling up pretty quickly. The bartenders looked a bit flustered with the crowd, but I would think they were making good tips since 90percent of the crowd were Wisconsin fans(vacation money, spend it all)  We had a $4 Hurricane which hit the spot, after that we had one of the frozen drinks, was perfect for the heat, can't remember which one, but whatever has the most booze in it.  They also offer the NFL Sunday ticket, but I only counted 8 TV's, so I can't imagine this place on a Sunday.  I'll be back, but probably not till Fat Tuesday.",

Came in the floor was sticky, sat down and the table was dirty and had to wait for them to clean one even though it was dead. We started to order for all of us before everyone was gonna show then the waitress, who clearly had bad hygiene look as if she literally rolled out of bed and put her hair into a bun which was falling apart, asked for our ID's...I'm over 21 but my sister is 20 and said with an attitude \"You're not even allowed in here\" when literally there was kids at the next table. Before coming into the restaurant we tried to look for a sign if it was 21 and older situation but did not see one sign...and the waitress says \"yeah, you have to be 21 to eat in here, we just don't want the board on us for having under age people in here\" well then place a sign outside saying you only want 21 and over. Yes I understand its a bar/grill but most of the places I've been have no problem. Besides that the kitchen area looked dirty...something like Jon Taffer would have a field day.",

My college town had a great alcoholic smoothie/slushie pace and it was bomb, everyone loved it and could not get enough of it. Sadly, Fat Tuesday does not hold a candle to it.  Mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude. I asked him about the special written on the board outside and he told me that was only for happy hour (then maybe you should write that on the board). I stalled before ordering and asked my firned what she was getting. She said something then I ordered too based off what I saw on the machines, I just wanted something fruity. We both told him our orders and he goes, \"Whatever, girls\" and laughed. Um, I'm sorry? Did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order? If you don't want people ordering girly drinks, don't make them! Needless to say we only tipped him fifty cents, still making our SMALL drinks $5.  Not going back here ever.",

    "text": "This is one of those places on Mill that always seems really popular, so every now and again you feel the need to go inside and see what all the noise is about, but you are left disappointed every time.  Let me just shoot off the bad so we can get that out of the way: always a long line outside for no reason, incredibly sugary frozen alcoholic beverages are gross, and a $10 minimum on credit card transactions (so lame).  They do have a decent deal on Fireball shots (like 3 bucks per shot on some nights) and they have Yelp check-in offers, but you cannot combine the two (understandable but you would think that this place has some type of saving grace). Music is usually decent but about every third song is just a terrible remix of an overplayed radio Top 40 song.  I'd suggest some of the more unique options nearby like Robbie Fox's or Cue Club.",

Well, tonight my brother was tackled, put in a choke hold & brang to the police for absolutely no reason! A guy came up to him, punched him & ran. For no reason at all.

This is the kind of place where underage ASU kids sneak in and a frat boy roofies a girl's drink and catches her alone in the dark, grimy, secluded bathroom area. I'm serious. It's that bad.  This is not comparable to the daiquiri/margarita slush deals in Vegas either.  The overjuiced Pauly D look-a-like bartender would not leave us alone, and kept regaling us with tales of why girlfriends and boyfriends are a waste of time and you should just kick em to the curb in the morning.... Thanks for the advice, broseph, I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend that.  And speaking of the hangovers: You know how I knew I was going to get a hangover? Not because of the alcohol in my drink, but because of the sugar. It was like they dumped 10 lbs of sugar in each machine. And guess when I got that hangover? Not 20 minutes after finishing my drink. Talk about feeling like crap, ingest 300 grams of sugar along with probably 3 shots of rum blended with ice. BLECK.",

They have a full bar, but most people sip on the frozen drinks, as is immediately obvious. I had two of those, but they were pretty good, the miami vice was probably the one I'd recommend though. The outside was cool too, if you're not into loud music, you can just chill on a patio. I don't know when the dress code comes into play, because it says \"no hoods, no neck tattoos, etc.\" I have both of those, and they didn't care. All-in-all, pretty cool, but the service could have been better. I felt like the bartender that helped me was annoyed, and all I asked was \"which of these drinks are the best sellers?\"",

Keep in mind, all find of my friends in front of me were wearing necklaces too, but I was the only one he said something to. So I take off my cross, get inside and put it right back on. 2 minutes later, the bouncer walked up to me, tapped me on the shoulder and walked me out of the bar.

Waited for a long time to get a drink when you can clearly see the manger on duty pouring himself vodka drinks and beers. That wasn't even the worst part about my night. I was talking to security guards out back and was offered \"molly\" and if I wanted some he could get it from one of the bartenders who both clearly were on drugs. Not sure what happen to this place but clearly has gone down hill in a bad way.",

    "text": "NEVER GO HERE. When my party of 15 and I walked hungrily into Fat Tuesday's, we were pleasantly surprised. This being my basketball team's first ever experience with the popular chain restaurant, we did not know what to expect. We enjoyed the fun music, and the lively atmosphere. The menu, although basic, met all of our expectations. After ordering from the accommodating waiters, my party and I were very excited to sit back and enjoy our meal. After a typical waiting period, the first five plates came out of the kitchen and onto our table. Then after around five minutes later, the next round of plates came out. This left five people of my party, including myself, waiting. And waiting, and waiting, and waiting. About 45 minutes after the first round of plates came out, we were starting to grow impatient. As my teammates finished off their meals, satisfied, the five of us continued to wait. We mentioned to our, once accommodating, waiters about our lack of service twice without receiving anything in return.  As the rest of our party was ready to put on their jackets and hit the road, we were still without our meal. At the two hour mark, a manager came out with a basket of pity chips to try to make up for their lack of service. This especially angered our group because we ordered chips and guacamole as our appetizer and was confused on why they were incapable of fulfilling our order, but willing to give us a basket of chips. My party and I were not having it. We were officially pissed off at Fat Tuesdays, and their shitty service turned our night of fun into a night of hell. My teammates and I played three basketball games in a row earlier today, and were simply looking forward to a meal to refuel our systems. FINALLY, our food arrived. Subpar at best, we ate the damn thing. My teammate's hamburger did not resemble the ones that came out of the kitchen two hours earlier. After quickly finishing the food, we just wanted to get the hell out. My party waited for our checks, although none of us expected that the five who went hours without service would have to pay for their meal. To our shocking dismay, our fucking waitress looked us in the eyes, and handed us our full price checks. OVERALL, NEVER GO TO FAT TUESDAYS. THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE LEFT VERY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED.",

So he finds a manager who looks at my phone screen for a good 8 minutes even though all it says is \"5$ off any size daiquiri of your choice\" so I'm not sure what she was so confused about. Then the bartender proceeds to give me a large daiquiri without asking what size I want and goes \"that will be 4$\" so when I paid I double checked and I asked \"is this a large?\" (Because I wasn't asked what size and I would of never ordered a large). And he goes \"yeah and you got it for 4$ so be happy\". The attitude I got from both employees was so unnecessary and unprofessional that I'm actually spending the rest of my night writing this review instead of drinking my nasty 4$ drink that I should of gotten for free.",

My favorites are White Russian and Mangoberry. I also recommend the 190 Octane, and make sure to try the cherries soaked in Everclear; a mouthful of alcoholic greatness. Be careful,  because if you are a light drinker,  the cherries, will hit ya.    The DJ rocks the beats while you dance into the night.  The mixologists are nice and courteous happy to serve you up alcoholic deliciousness. Nice atmosphere, a mixed group of people looking to have a drama free good time.

I'm Catholic and have grown to enjoy the Fat Tuesday tradition that the day before the beginning of Lent and Ash Wednesday one goes a little wild preceding the sacrifice that is Lenten season. Maybe I just love a good party.  I've been to New Orleans for Mardi Gras and for many years went to Mardi Gras in St Louis. Even here in the Valley of the Sun, 10 years ago there was a really good Mardi Gras party at a bar called Sugar Daddies (now long closed.)  I have been going to Fat Tuesday on Mill for probably the last 5-6 years for their Fat Tuesday/Mardi Gras party. By now, you would think they would have perfected their biggest night the year. They have yet to figure out to create that perfect Bourbon Steet on Mill Ave vibe. I think mostly due to poor organization and lack of understanding of the original. Therefore, what should be a growing attendance each year seems almost to be slightly dwindling in size.  However, until I make it back to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, I still have a good enough time that I find myself coming back each year to Fat Tuesday on Mill for what is the biggest Mardi Gras party in the Valley.",

Do I look like the kind of person who wants to be detained in both the US and Canada?  The drinks were good, worth the money? No.  The bartender spent most of the night (and by night I mean the whole 45 minutes I could stand it there) throwing around cups and attempting to flair bottles. Many cups hit the ground. He cared more about trying to show off than actually helping people which is probably why I didn't tip, which is something I need a real reason to do. Verdict: I won't be back.  Recommendation: If you're looking to over spend and be ignored all night this is the place for you! If you're looking for people to do their jobs and pay a little less it's mill street, walk around and follow the crowd.",

The patio is nice and huge now with TVs and an outside bar. The drinks are always good, and they came up with a bunch of new concoctions. I had the Fruit Cocktail one, super good. It was a mix of the Pina Colada, Strawberry, Melon and Octane, it was like a new flavor in every sip.   The staff is friendly and not too chatty, but just enough.  We will for sure be back.",

I went with a gay couple, and the three of us had just gotten a round of drinks (our first drinks) and were dancing to \"Call Me Maybe\". One of the guys threw his arms around his boyfriend's shoulders for about two, perhaps three, seconds and immediately went back to dancing solo--and within five more seconds two guards told us that we were \"too drunk\" and had to \"leave immediately\". They ushered us out forcibly. We were, of course, completely sober--and when I realized what was most likely the cause of this \"drunk\" verdict I was so angry I was shaking.  Fat Tuesday, you will never get my service again if you respond to your paying customers with discrimination. I will be telling others about this occurrence.",

I also happened to show up the first weekend that school was in session so this place was semi-packed when I walked in at 9 p.m. There was a DJ playing some decent music but the dance floor wasn't crowded at all since it was early.  I got served relatively quickly. Since I was new to the place I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he instantly told me to get the 190 Octane ($5.50)  ...I didn't know it had Everclear in it until I grabbed a menu a few minutes later and saw what was in it. Holy smokes! The drink itself was pretty strong, but easy to down because of the slushie-like consistency and orange color and taste. I definitely was feeling GOOD after I left the bar.  There's a good amount of spiked-slushies you can try, so I'll definitely be back to test out some other ones.

And I should hate it.  But I don't.  Part of the problem comes from growing up in Miami.    The national drink of the Florida Keys is the Rum Runner.  It's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of Miami.  But Fat Tuesday's has it.  Well, all Fat Tuesday's besides this one.  WTF.    I was surprised to see that they have a drink made with Pyrat rum.  And it was fine.  But it wasn't the Fat Tuesday's experience of my youth that I was hoping for.   Where did the Rum Runner go?  Well, the bartender explained that they had to take out a few machines to make room for additional bottles of booze.  Apparently someone had the bright idea that Fat Tuesdays should actually mix cocktails besides just pour frozen boozy slushies into plastic cups.    Whoever had that idea should be fired.  Boozy slushies in plastic cups is what this place is about.  And in the heat of a Tempe summer a Rum Runner would be just about perfect.  But they are gone because apparently some fool thought it would be a good idea to sell cosmos too.",

I tried their fried pickles and wasn't a fan especially because it was served with ranch, I think it was too sour for me. Maybe BBQ might work better or sriracha.

I originally came here after looking for a Saturday happy hour. They have daiquiris for only $5.75 and food specials too from 4-7.  My friend and I shared the buffalo chicken dip which tasted great but the chip to dip ratio was definitely off. We were left over with about ten chips and no dip, sad day.  The drinks were really what made up for it though. Majority of the flavors are mixed with everclear vodka which is no joke. I went with the grape one which was decently good and gave me a nice little buzz.  Overall this is a great place for snacks and pregaming. Can't go wrong with good, cheap food and drinks.",

I've been to another Fat Tuesday in Key West and it's the same vibe at both locations, just different demos.   This Mill location though is crazy loud at night, sometimes to the point of insanity-let's-purposefully-lose-our-hearing-loud. It's unfortunate that it even bleeds into their small outdoor sitting area so you really can't have a conversation with anyone.   The drinks... whoa they are strong! I love the frozen daiquiris especially with friends so we can all get different ones to share.",

No wonder ASU is considered one of the largest party schools in the nation (fork 'em kids). On this street of restaurants and bars, you have one of the most notorious daiquiri serving spots in the world.  Sitting at the bar, we saw a lot of college kids frequenting this place, asking for mason jars full of booze and snacks to boot. I was not used to the idea of getting a Fat Tuesday and not traveling around with it like I usually would. However, they'e got some great Happy Hour deals here that make it worthwhile. $5 selected appetizers, $5.75 large (or medium) Fat Tuesdays, and $3.50 beers. Uh oh, trouble is coming.  Naturally had to order a large Strawberry/Mango mix. I would have gone for the 190 Octane, but feared I'd be needing to use the restroom a lot on my upcoming flight. We doused the alcohol with orders of the buffalo chicken dip and Fat's Original Fries, which were insanely, poutine delicious.  Good bar food, drinks, and an affordable price makes this one hard to pass up on Mill Ave. Be safe and drink responsibly kids.",

They had late night happy hour. But I came in for a drink. The only Fat Tuesday locations I've been to are the ones in Vegas. This one, you can sit down and grab food and a nice adult slushie beverage or whatever beer or liquor you may want as it is a full bar.  Lots of space. They closed the patio area down since it was a weekday. I'm sure it can get rowdy during the weekends and whatnot.",

Brought up the yelp coupon at the end of our meal for 1/2 off of a drink and the owner wouldn't honor it because it was happy hour although the coupon didn't mention you couldn't use it during happy hour. Their were children sitting at the bar where the adults were sitting and drinking and which to be quite honest I didn't even think was allowed in most states and our waitress was clueless. All in all I'd give this place a thumbs down with no chance of a repeat visit. Once was definitely enough for this city girl....",

Granted, I rarely go, and when I do, it's with a group of my closest friends. But cheap drinks. How can you go wrong? When you're bored, and have nothing better to do, take a group of your closest friends and grab cheap drinks. The atmosphere of the club is interesting. There are a lot of creepy, shady characters that frequent the place, save the few college kids that stand out like a moth on flypaper. The drinks...meh. They are alright.  You won't attain any orgasms by drinking the slushies, so I'd save my dollar bills for some shots of tequila, if you're able to handle that. All in all, I'd say that Fat Tuesday's is a place you would go to when you're extremely bored, and are broke. Don't expect ridiculously thin legged models, and a bunch of young, beerpong loving college coeds - or atleast on Monday's. Just go for the sake of your hurting wallet.",

We have always visited before the night time crowd comes.  When we walk in the door, the bartenders remember us, suggest yummy drinks, ask about us . . . treat us like we are special.   We have struck up many conversations with other patrons who enjoy going to Fat Tuesdays as much as we do.  During the day it''s a great place to just get out of the heat, cool off with their daquiris and eat a delicious Po Boy.  Jason is our favorite bartender . . . and we have lots of laughs with him!   I am counting the days until weI will be back in AZ to go to Fat Tuesday!",

I haven't been in a while, but we tend to go when it's not as busy (during Spring Break, December and the summer).  Notice the strategic anti-ASU pattern there?  No offense, but Fat Tuesday can be a fun place with the right people.   When we go we get our run of the show (there's usually under 20 people there) on off-nights.  The main draws being cheap $1 frozen daquiri drinks on Wednesdays (oh, 190 Octane how I LOVE your orange goodness!), free rein with the music video requests, and a huge dance floor to ourselves.  It got so fun and crazy one off-night that some chick dared Melinda to a Michael Jackson \"Thriller\" dance-off.  And, well, Mel just kicked her butt.  Word to the wise...cheap, sticky drinks tend to equal gross sticky floors.",

Mind you, we went on a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't packed, there wasn't a DJ and no one was blacked out drunk but there is a place just like this in Downtown San Diego that I love going to and this place was exactly like it! It was 105 outside and me being used to year long 70 degree weather..I needed something frozen and I needed a buzz to cope with the damn heat. The Mango Berry slushee was the ticket! This place is great, and the patio is very spacious. Looks like it could be a good time at night. Definitely a place you want to go to when you want a quick buzz...get one drink (any of them, really) and one of those cherries soaked in Everclear and you're good for the night!",

The guys can usually be found on the patio barking lame pick up lines at the female passerbys and the ladies are usually grinding it up on the small dance floor on the weekend nights.  With the summer heat, Fat Tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated. But if you don't want to drink them with the college crowd, hit the bar during the day or early evenings.",

I order their mix on line and have daiquiri parties at home.I have more flavors of their drink mix than this bar does.  The Fat Tuesday in Minnesota( now closed due to state licensing issues) had the best jambalaya around, I was told it was brought in from Louisiana.  The managers here decided the menu wasn't working and went to burgers and bar snacks,....what I ordered was nasty, It was a combo appetizer, I only  ate it because I ordered a drink. The pizza I saw  looked un -edible,unless your drunk. The service was horrible ! I waited for ever to get a drink and to order food,Trust me it wasn't busy either.  Speaking of which, there were only 5 flavors of daiquiris,the rest of the bar is a vodka bar ! One whole side is mixed drinks,nothing to choose from daiquiri -wise. This is not up to Fat Tuesdays standards for anything.  In my opinion, unless they get off Mill Ave, I think this place will be gone soon.Or they should change the name, they  have NO business calling it self a Fat Tuesday. If I hadn't been in a dozen other ones , I would never go to a Fat Tuesdays again.",

I originally wanted to try a Fat Tuesday out in Vegas, but due to my hectic schedule out there, I never got a chance, but I had the opportunity to try the one in Tempe.  Concept-wise it is a cool idea, slushies with alcohol, so you can keep cool and get wasted at around $7 a pop. Other than that the place lacks. When I went it was pretty empty besides a few seedy people, and a magician showing off his talents. There is a patio so you can people-watch as you sip your frozen alco-slush, which might give you a slight buzz depending on what you got.  After you finish your slushie, you  probably have the idea of moving on and just walking around Mill Avenue because there is nothing really worth it here - that's if you call alcoholic slushies worth it. There are better bars in the area, with more of an atmosphere and less of a gimmick.",

Here you can have multiple flavor daiquiris, served frozen. But I tried a sample of the Octane, felt like I was drinking ice. No flavor whatsoever, didn't even taste the alcool in it. So I had a Purple Haze Ale instead. Nothing exciting, but I kept drinking it.   Let's switch to food. Menu looks nice, I went with the Swiss burger (cooked RARE) with the caramelized onions. A complete disappointment. First of all, the burger took 20 minutes to cook, I already predicted it was not going to be rare. Second, these people have no idea what caramelized onions are. Cause there were actually raw onions in it. When I made my complaint, the bartender said: \"Oh we just sauteed the onions.\" Great, is this your highest level of refinement?? So he comped it and I got another one. Second burger was actually medium rare, I appreciate the improvement. Still, with raw onions in it.   Sweet potato fries were good. The only good thing about it. Bartender and other staff members are not friendly. They don't greet people at the beginning, no smile, no care. When it was actually time to pay the bill, the bartender sort of showed he was finally paying attention, and he cleared the plate in front of me.  Yeah well, too late.

Usually I sit at the bar and the service is decent but last night I decided to sit at a table and we were left sitting there for 15 minutes before a waitress ever came to us. But of course I went to the bar to order my drink and I let the bartender know that we had been waiting before she finally showed up. And we never saw her again until we wanted to close out our tab but we couldn't even find her so we grabbed a different waitress to hand us our check. Another thing that sucks about this place is the music.",

We stumbled in here and there's music and dancing going on in one corner, pump after pump of frozen booze drinks beside a full bar, some food and dining scattered about, outdoor smoking, scooter rides (I think that was added on by people not the establishment itself!) Any way, I really enjoyed the frozen white russian I was drinking. It was pretty enormous--but midway through it another drinker snagged it when I turned my back? Odd. Anyway, the rest of the drinks here were good and the food was surprisingly good too--chicken wings in particular.  So, a pretty fun bar to check out for sure.",

The music is great on Fridays and Saturdays they play a lot of new artist new hip hop but also mixes it up to with some older jams from the 90s. I've had their food a couple times and the food is good as well. Though I do not come to Fat Tuesdays for the food I mainly come for the slushy drinks that are amazing! Pretty much every flavor that is on the menu is absolutely great! I usually get the octane 190 mixed with mango. It is so delicious!be careful because they can sneak up on you! However, I definitely recommend that drink. Their happy hour is also really good with the discounted price on the drinks and the food as well. I definitely recommend going and checking it out for the slushy the food or the nightlife with dancing!",

It would have been nice if we were informed. Kind of like a \"last call\", if you will.  Things that were better - Regardless, the bartender was nice. She gave me a sample of a drink I was questioning. She refilled my mom's water each time she stopped by. She got a little crazy and started dancing towards closing. Lol. But it was funny.  Also, nachos were good even with the missing topping. All of the drinks were good and/or strong.",

There are two outdoor seating areas...streetside and backside. Inside there is a long bar and tables. This place specializes in frozen enquiries. Tried a 151 Colada Creamsicle...not bad! My buddy ordered up an order of garlic fries...now these were crispy and very tasty...possibly the best I'd ever had. I can see getting a craving for these again in the future.  Lots of TV monitors inside and fairly wide open. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon which was a surprise considering that NFL divisional championship games were goin progress. No objection to coming back here...especially for more garlic fries!",

The center of Tempe is definitely geared to the college crowd since ASU is right there.    We chose to sit outside in the back.  The music wasn't quite so overbearing back there and at least we could talk. I'm thinking if we had stayed inside it would have been way too loud to even hear ourselves.  The server was amazing and even the best part of eating here.  Not to say what we ordered wasn't good.  It was but the server really shown.  We were all extremely pleased with our meals from the quesadillas to the pitas and to the chicken wings.  The food was delicious.  We would all return if in the area again.",

Then our server came and was equally as informative on the specials & whats good to eat and both these guys were ON THEIR GAME! I asked their names and the manager said his name was Joe and our server was Garrett. Service was like i was at a 5 star restaurant and food was good! I can't talk up the service enough!

First of all the frozen alcohol drinks are the best at 8 dollars and change and get your buzz going which is more bang for your buck, the dance floor is pretty nice and big, bar tenders are friendly, and most of all their not racist and let everybody in. I now see more college students going here and I love the atmosphere because the staff is so nice and polite! I love the DJ who spends a mix of techno, hip hop, and pop that gets everybody in here feeling to get turned up! I recommend this bar to anybody and especially ASU students because the only color they know is green and they don't judge. I bring friends here and they always come back! keep up the good work guys and I will always be here every chance I get....",

The music was pretty decent and typical, I can't imagine someone complaining about the music being \"too loud\" for an establishment such as this. The girls were shameless and there were hot guys as far as the eye could see (note: there were also creepy old dudes hanging around just waiting for the right drunken bimbo to fall into their arms asking if they were her daddy). I should mention that the guy to girl ratio was something like 5:1, but I wasn't really complaining.   My only complaint about this place - being that I don't typically wear anything other than my rainbows - is that I was incapable of easily moving my feet, I had to use quite a bit of force to lift them off of the ground, walk, or even move. The floor was so sticky, I can't imagine that they EVER actually clean that floor with anything other than a hose. The morning after I even found bits and pieces of the floor from Fat Tuesday stuck to soles of my sandals.   Other than that, this place was pretty cool - if you're a guy looking to get a girl drunk (fast) I'd suggest taking her here, especially since they offer such a high variety of slushy, fruity, and heavy-on-the-alcohol drinks.",

On busy nights they have a dress code. The usuals, no gang stuff, no ripped jeans, etc. I did notice a no face or neck tattoos sign though.

IThe small menu contains a handful of items 95% of which are fried, which is great when you are drinking. No complaints on the mozzarella sticks from me!  My huge problem with Fat Tuesday are their beer prices...$4 for a Bud Light bottle. That is just absurd in my opinion considering I could just walk down the street and get a $5 pint of Harp at Rula Bula.  I haven't tried the slush drinks yet, but perhaps on the next nice Saturday afternoon I am on Mill, I will because I am guessing they are a better deal in terms of price and alcohol content.  They were quite popular with our friends last time we were there.  Fat Tuesday isn't a reason to go to Mill, but an adequate stop if you are there and just want a drink or two on a sunny spring day.",

    "text": "I don't care for many Mill Avenue establishments during the school year. Drunken frat boys playing alpha male and sorority girls doing their slutty exhibitionist thing just hit a sour note. However in the off hours of college binge drinking, say Saturday day drinking or summer and winter break, I really enjoy me some Mill Avenue. One of my favorite places on the strip is Fat Tuesdays.  You see, I have a weakness. And that weakness is slushy drinks. Slush puppies, Mr. Mistys, Icees, and the mother of them all...the pina colada. Which in a nutshell is why I like Fat Tuesdays. It's pure sugar and ice blended into a melange of delicious. Granted, all the red frozen drinks taste the exact same, but the 190 Octane, Pina Colada thing, Blue Raspberry and Mango are delicious flavors that end in big old hangovers if you overindulge. But since they're frozen, it takes much longer to sip one down than a regular mixed drink, saving you money and still messing you up (provided you go the 190 Octane route).   Make sure to try an Atomic Cherry (or Nuclear Cherry or whatever they're called) for 50 cents while you're there. It's a downright painfully delicious experience. If you go with a group, which is recommended because you have to bring your own posse of fun up to Mill Avenue, splurge for a round of them. Then watch even the manliest macho man agree that those everclear soaked cherries are a painful bitch to confront.  But under all circumstances, don't get the food. It's sucktastic, and with so many other awesome options around Mill, why bother?",

No gumbo, no etouffe, etc.  Looks like basic American pub food.  Which is fine, but I don't get the Cajun angle.  We ordered the adada fries and the cilantro lime salad.  The asada fries were disappointing.  The fries were fine.  Despite all the sauces they weren't mushy, but were light and crisp and had nice flavor.  But the asada (beef) was nothing.  Very little flavor. Tasted like it had been fried in a deep fryer. The dish might have been better without the beef.  The cilantro lime salad was drowning in dressing, but apparently the flavor was good.  Our daughter liked it.  The excess dressing isn't really a big problem since it just settles into the bottom of the bowl, though the tortilla strips will get soggy.  So I guess they were batting .500.  Which isn't very good in my book.  We did not partake of any drinks/cocktails.  They seemed to have a well-stocked bar, and perhaps that is what attracts folks.  The food just didn't do it for me.",

We also had this huge mason jar drink I don't even know what it was called but it was very good, but very sweet! The music was perfect and the DJ kept the place on beat. The people watching from the patio is awesome! We had great seats right out front.  As for food we had the street tacos which was very savory, the queso and chips, just wish it was a bigger bowl of queso. And we also had the chicken tenders, they were a little peppery bit overall very good!  The staff was very friendly and keep a good eye on us. The prices overall we not that bad especially if you are out to have a good time then it doesn't really matter haha. I 100% think this is my favorite bar on Mill Ave. I will be back again.",

They played really great music (hip-hop mix) and the vibe was ideal. There was lots of different kinds of people coming in and out so if people are looking to meet people, hook up, dance, or drink great drinks this is the place to go! One tip though: IF YOU HAVE PEPPER SPRAY they do ask that you leave the spray and your ID at the front desk.

    "text": "My first meal in Arizona in 22 years started here.  I used to live in the Mesa area while going to school back in the 90's.  We had an overnight layover after vacationing in Mexico and decided to stop in Phoenix instead of Dallas.  And when there is free time, it's all about the food!  As I searched the Tempe area on Yelp, Fat Tuesday popped up.  Looked at the menu and was sold as I love Southern food.  Plus, they're located on infamous Mill Avenue, an area I wanted to show my spouse.  ATMOSPHERE: ID was required to enter at dinner time.  I thought they were a restaurant but they're more of a bar, so the absence of little ones was nice.  Inside lighting was dim, with a mix of bar seats, low and high tops.  Covered front patio seating looked onto Mill Ave. while rear patio seating sported backyard-style furniture and tables under colorful string lights.  Daiquiri machines lined the back of bar.  A live DJ spun and music pumped throughout the eatery.  The vibe is young and fun.  MENU: Southern-influenced bar-style apps, pasta, sandwiches, wraps, salads, burgers, desserts, daiquiris, beer, wine, sangria.  BEVERAGE: Creamsicle Daiquiri - $9.00 (large) OMG, this was absolutely delish!  After ordering my boring white wine, my spouse said to take a sip of the daiquiri.  I immediately canceled the wine.  I guess they're known for their cornucopia of flavors, apparent from the lengthy menu.  The daiquiri was thick and icy, and tasted just like a creamsicle popsicle.  Being dubbed with their 190 Octane moniker, it also included a bit of Everclear, oh yeah.  Because we were having dinner elsewhere, I sadly only had one.  FOOD: Alligator Nugs - $15.00 Yup, this was real alligator meat inside and it was really good.  The texture was just as the server described - a mix between chicken and fish.  The \"nugs\" were breaded, deep-fried and were insanely moist and tender.  We opted for Cajun fries which had a nice kick to them.  I preferred ranch dressing to their remoulade sauce for dipping.  Highly recommended!  Wings - $11.50 (10-pieces) The Cajun dry rub had a spice level of 3 on a 5-scale.  While mostly savory, there was a bit of sweetness in the rub that I wish wasn't there, but, I finished all of it.  The wings were cooked perfectly crispy with fairly juicy insides.  A seriously great deal for normally pricey wings.  Ranch and blue cheese dressings were tasty accompaniments.  SERVICE: The bouncer checking ID's was friendly.  It's seat yourself so we chose a table in the rear patio.  Lexi was our server and greeted us shortly after sitting.  I thought we wouldn't receive good service due to her young age but she was great.  She answered all of our questions, checked on us often and was very professional.  OVERALL: What a great find!  Fun vibe, tasty daiquiris, good food.",

Have always loved the walk in get a frozen drink (especially in Az) to cool off and stagger back to the hotel or to the nearest food vibe.   I remembered the menu being a little different, not so everclear heavy, but I was still able to find a few things to quench my thirst and unwind with. Hasn't changed a bit other than the drink selection. Nice to go back to someplace familiar.. especially since it's been 20+ years since the first time I went.",

    "text": "Perfect place to go and cool down during the hot summers. A nice cold daiquiri will always do the trick. They have many flavors and will let you sample any before making a purchase.   I like to also get the big shareable drinks when there is a group of 3 or more. The drinks run for about $24 but when you split it you aren't paying that much.   I haven't had a full meal from here however I do like to get bar food when I'm drinking. The quesadilla and tenders are perfect to pair with a daiquiri.   Fat Tuesday turns into a club around 10 each night. There isn't a huge crowd during the summer months since students are typically out of town or off campus. Still there is a Dj and good music as well as a full bar.",

The drinks are really strong (MOST of the time), so start with a slushie and by the time you leave for the next bar you'll be feeling pretty good. The music here is...okay to good. Sometimes I come in and it's one hype song after another and then some random techno mixed with another song will come on and it gets pretty dead after that. I don't think I've ever been here when it was extremely packed but it is great for a night starter. The guys are kind of creepy and lurk a lot. This is also the place usually where preppy people flock here to wistfully watch a couple of girls grind on each other, which would be cool if there wasn't someones dad also mixed in there trying to get in on some of the action...anyways, I digress. tl;dr: Come here for a slushie or two, dance for a bit, and then move on to Zuma",

Wouldn't recommend that. The cheese wasn't even melted when we ordered it. Parking is horrible but it is downtown Tempe so you gotta expect that. Giving it 3 stars bc the person walking around with shots told us it was $1.00 per shot. We ordered 2 rounds and it was $2.00 a shot. Not that big of a deal but when you order plenty of them and get the receipt to show you paid double than what was told to you... that isn't the best experience. Overall cool place though",

I've never experienced any problems with the staff like other people, but I wouldn't doubt that there are smart asses working there. Put them in place!  Drinks are average price, with the slushies being the specialty. Depending on the night they will have a DJ playing run of the mill top 40 crap, but it doesn't really interfere with your drinking. Crowd is a mix of ASU students and townies, depending on the time of year. Come with low expectations and leave happy!",

If you can get a day where the front patio is smoke free, it is a good spot to watch the folks cruise past on Mill. The only thing with that is a bad fly problem in the front..oh you will see.

Described aptly as \"7-11 on acid\" the giant bank of alcoholic slurpee, er daiquiri, machines is a sight to behold! Try to catch a glimpse of the inner workings while waiting for the men's room (its fine to go into the locking one ladies) its kind of crazy in there! All sorts of whirring machines and people leaping around with gallon buckets of daiquiri mixes, or stirring 50 gallon vats of daiquiri mix that recently had an obscene amount of liquor dumped into it.  Wait a minute! They don't only have daiquiri drinks! They've got a full bar! They've got food too? WTF? Fats actually has a pretty good kitchen. If you come in for lunch, sit at the bar. The servers really aren't interested...honestly this is probably one of the worst places in the world to be a server. Go to the bartenders, they are happy.  Remember though, the whole point of this place is to get you drunk. They know their job well. They have levers to pull on a bank of machines that makes drunks, they hand you a glass of something that is generally over 150 proof (75% ABV). The most famous drink is the 190 Octane, it really is 190 proof (95% ABV) then you can get everclear soaked cherries as well...  I have never left this place sober.",

They do have a dance floor, but never seen anyone use it maybe they do late at night. The drinks are fairly cheap and we got super drunk one night which was fun!!! Would we go back again?

Was there for a good 4 hours, walked a few feet from the back entrance to take a phone call and when I tried coming back in they tried to charge me another cover charge. The security guy acknowledged that he seen me walk away and insisted that he could not let me in without another fee. When I asked who his boss was he refused to give that info. I had already spent a good $80 on myself there and didn't think it was right to charge me to reenter the event I had already been at and spending good money on. This experience was so bad that I will not spend another penny at this establishment. I now absolutely hate this place!!!",

So on occasion you will get some college kids in there trying to show how \"tough\" they are in front of everyone.",

There the same kinds of people we all know...the kind that never get invited back to parties that you throw. There that guy/girl that get their weeble on way too early in the night and end up spilling something that is red, blue or green in color all over your brand new, mostly white kicks. These people are 99% of the patrons of Fat Tuesdays' on Mill Avenue.  I had exactly one legitimate use for Fat Tuesdays in my life; my 21st birthday. During which I sucked down one of their god awful grain liquor concoctions, got brain freeze, bought random people atomic cherries, made out with a fat girl and projectile vomited a strange orange-brownish ichor all over the men's room shitter. Then I went to a sleazy strip club, which was money much better spent.  No respectable person, with the noted exception of celebrating their 21st birthday, should ever patronize this place. Based on a simple algebraic formula there technically shouldn't be enough 21st birthdays to keep this place in business. This vortex of suck has been around longer than any other bar on the Mill avenue strip (see: Casey Moore's is not on Mill) and is an anomaly that goes against the laws of time and space; Einstein is very upset. If you are a regular to this place and not some kind of being from an alternative universe or celebrating someone's 21stbirthday you are dead to me.  On a final note; if you are a being from an alternative universe please get in contact with me. I've got a few questions I'd like to ask you.",

I got a pair of birthday cake shots (since apparently all anyone had gotten my friend through most of the night were shots of Fireball and tequila) and a Peach Bellini slushie, which was a godsend on a night that was most likely 100+ outside. The birthday cake shots were fantastic and the Peach Bellini was even better.   Inside it was a little crowded, but still managed to be a comfortable temperature. The patio, on the other hand, had very few people so we were able to grab a table for our group right under the misters.  Really, the only irritating part was how pushy they were about getting people out the door once they closed and barely gave any warning to finish our drinks. But I can kind of understand the pushyness, considering it's Mill and the number of drunk college students they usually have to deal with.",

    "text": "We went here for my girlfriend's birthday this past weekend. We were there for maybe a half an hour and the drinks were eh. Ok. Their big thing is the wall of slushy mixed drinks behind the bar. Those are eh. Ok. The ice greatly waters down the little bit of alcohol in them. What's worse is the flavor doesn't even make up for it. It's basically like drinking water alcohol with food coloring in it. Which considering the quality and amount of alcohol given, they're overpriced as well. My girlfriend was not drunk and excused herself to the restroom. She felt sick earlier after dinner and got sick in the restroom in the trash can. Some guy, who shouldn't have been in the ladies restroom in the first place, looked at me and said she has to go. \"She threw up she has to go!\" I was calmly trying to explain that we had just gotten there and that she had barely had anything to drink. He didn't care. We went back to the table to tell our friends we had to leave and he ran over and flashed his light in her face. A guy from the door came over. I tried to explain to him as well and my gf was totally fine and trying to explain to the other gentleman. The guy from the bathroom said \"I don't care if I said she's gotta go she's gotta go!\" The worst part about this is, is that neither one of us raised our voices except to be heard over music and were totally respectful the whole time. It completely jumped the night off on the wrong foot and caused my girlfriend to be upset and embarrassed on her birthday. I will never return and neither will any of our 8 friends that were witness to this that evening. We'll also be writing other reviews on other sites as well.",

Mark, one of the managers, insisted that I let him pay to overnight the card to me at my hotel, which he did.    The card was the only means of payment I had on the trip, so needless to say this was a life saver.   THAT is something you never see anymore because THAT is real customer service.

It was a Saturday night, I moved quickly through the short line, found seating even though it was 10PM and it was an awesome vibe that evening! The frozen drinks are bomb if you get the extra shot, however a little on the pricey side and might take you 10 minutes to get it. The next time I visited was during a weekday at about 3pm. Headed straight out side and found it to be pretty nice actually...relaxed, cool place to chill in the daytime!! Overall i love the place and I will definitely be going back!

There's outdoor seating, private rooms, a dance floor, DJ, bar and food with a happy hour.... WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE ABOUT THIS PLACE?!?! Went in on a Wednesday night after the Suns game and it was pretty empty- but the DJ was still spinning the new hits.   If you're not sure what flavor slushee you want to try- the bartender will let you sample.   Pass on the cajun wings- the flavor is a rub and is pretty dry in my opinion.

    "text": "Sometimes I really wonder what my fellow Yelpers are really reviewing. What do they want Fat Tuesday's to be - a gormet bar that sprinkes magic dust into your drink that helps you get laid? C'mon peeps, judge it for what it is.  As others have said, this place's main thing is their wall of frozen booze. I feel like I'm in a Quick-Trip ordering a drink. Well, until I eat that damn Atomic Cherry that has been soaking in Everclear and I sip my drink that is heavily diluted with some alcohol. then I quickly realize that if I am going to drink two or more of these things... I might want to call a cab or I'll be getting pulled over by a horse cop as I exit Mill Ave.  Is it a dance club? Sure, it has a dance floor. But I like to think of it more as a place to watch people who have had 2 too many slushies try to shake it (all in good fun of course, because I've done it). This isn't no Rain night club of Vegas, people.   What's good? No cover. People come and go so there is always someone new to talk to or watch. Outside area is a blast to sit and drink and people watch the people of Mill. Bartenders are lightning quick and make my drinks very well.  I love this place. What is there not to love unless you are looking for Scottsdale glamour.",

    "text": "Me and my friends were on a layover in Phoenix and were told to go to Mill st. for a couple hours. We walked past this place and had to turn back because the music was too good. We went in and enjoyed the happy hour on almost all drinks. So inexpensive! And best of all the service was unparalleled. The bartender, Ryan, was so sweet in suggesting different drinks, telling us about AZ, and just giving us some awesome company. We will definitely be hitting this place up when we're back in Tempe. Check out the local beers, the dance floor, and the margarita mixes.",

We were not only welcomed the second we walked in the door but he continued to check in on us and made great recommendations with food and drinks. I have come here for years and always enjoy it but this was by far one of my favorite trips here. Thanks to Brandon for the excellent service!",

    "text": "I was here on a Saturday afternoon after we had just eaten at Hot n Juicy. Right as I checked in there was a deal being offered for 1/2 price drinks. So, that was pretty sweet. I got an order of the 190 high octane drink which you can never go wrong with. Couple of friends I was with got the bomb pop drink. The place was pretty much empty, but hey it was a Saturday afternoon so it was probably a different type of atmosphere at night. So, when we were there it was still laid back and had a very chill vibe to it. Almost like a little kick back. We also decided to try the atomic cherries. Man, those are always fun, lol.   The bartender was very cool and kept us engaged and we never felt like we were being ignored even though there were only at max maybe 8 people there. He was professional and made sure we were taken care off. They had Happy Hour that started at 4pm that day with 1/2 off drinks. Can't beat a happy hour like that! They also had a pretty dope patio setting which will be an even better place to chill at when the weather here starts cooling down a bit.Other things I noticed was the other employees were also nice and professional. It has ample space because after we left I think they were hosting a NFL Draft Party and looks like they kept their place clean.",
