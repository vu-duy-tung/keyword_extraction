They have the *best* carrot, jalapeno, cauliflower mix on their condiment bar, not the same boring stuff you get at just about every other \"real\" Mexican dive. They have 3 basic salsas: green, red, and smokey red.  Try them all to find your favorite.  My favorite dish is the breakfast plate with chorizo. This is chorizo that you can actually taste, not the stuff you find at many places that tastes like hamburger. The lunch items are very good, too. Like any dive, it might take a few tries to find your favorite dishes.  And the menudo (weekends) is about as real as it gets.  I.e. Excellent.",

We moved to Scottsdale for my husband's job and we're on the hunt for some good Mexican food. We want to find both a  \"hole-in-the-wall\" place and a good restaurant (where we can take family and out of town guests) that have flavorful food. We had high hopes for this one based on ratings and reviews, but for the life of us we can't understand why there were so many good reviews. Hungry college students, perhaps? I don't know.

In order from best to worst: Tripas- flavorful, tender, i like them a bit more crunchy but they were very good Pastor- the pinneapple flavore really shined and they were pretty tender Asada- a bit boring and on the dry side.  Would have been good had it been fresher and right off the grill Carnitas- also would have been better if they were warmed on the grill first.  A bit dry and I bit into grissle more than once.  There were three salsas at the bar as well as pickled carrots and jalapenos, raidshes, limes, and roasted jalapenos.  The three salsas were seriously legit.  Two reds and a green and they each held their own.  All in all it is a dive spot with tasty salsas and okay tacos.  I would go back again if I was in the area to try more dishes.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch based on yelp reviews, I was craving shrimp cocktail. I'm pregnant and what the baby wants the baby gets. When I first pulled up, I was like... oh... uh.... I contemplated going somewhere else because it definitely looks sketchy from the outside. But I decided to trust the yelpers and I went in, and my whole mindset completely changed. It's small, but it's totally clean, organized, and nice inside! A lot of places to sit and it was all just very clean. I was surprised. The lady who took my order was nice, didn't speak too much English but enough to get my order right which is all I cared about.   While I waited for my food I got some of their hot carrots/jalapenos and was happy to find there was also hot cauliflower in there, which I love (the baby loves). My food came out in a few minutes and I took it back to work to eat. My shrimp cocktail was really good. Just what you'd expect, nothing super fancy but the shrimp was very big and they were not stingy. I only ordered the medium, at first I wished I got the large but while I was eating I kept finding more and more big shrimp in the cup and it was definitely satisfying enough for lunch. Also they were generous with the avocado too, which always makes me happy.   I ate my hot carrots and cauliflower by themselves after and it may sound silly but they were soo good. They were really spicy and tangy all the way through, but not mushy or overly hard with no flavor like some places. It was so good I wish I had gotten more!  5 stars, even though it's a little shady on the outside, I can't knock them for that. I will definitely be back again soon for the carne asada everyone is talking about!",

It earns every one of the five stars.  I ate here once last week, and I am heading back today to try something different.  Based on the store facade, I would have never tried Tacos Jaliscos, but Yelp has taught me time and again to listen to the reviews and not to judge a book by its cover.  If you're looking for atmosphere, this is not your place.  If you're looking for incredibly tasty and authentic Mexican food at a great price, then this should be your next stop.

    "text": "First of all, you could almost miss this tiny gem, in a small strip mall that includes a laundromat and a Circle K. But my husband did some \"best taco,\" researching and we ended up here. The price of $1.51 per taco, certainly makes a trip completely risk free! I ordered 3 chicken tacos, chips & guac, and horchata. Hubby ordered chili rieonos & a big bottle of Fanta. The tacos are spicy! Beware gringos! But for my taste it was perfect! I love a little spice & they were full of flavor with tomatoes, onions, and cilantro inside.  Best described as street tacos, I loved them!!! Will be back to try steak!  The guac is more of a runny green sauce, something I have seen at Mexican grocers as opposed to chunky pure guac.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the chili rejonos (can't spell that word!) His nose was running from the spicy (total gringo )  The atmosphere was clean and cafe style. Order at the counter and they call your number. There was a line the whole time we were there for Sunday evening at 6pm, they seem to be a busy spot!",

If you like pickled vegetables and all the jalapenos and carrots and that kind of stuff they are these's plenty of that, and if you like fresh radishes, plenty of limes and the salsa bar is just wonderful. I've only had the Carnitas and the carne Asada so far but both of them are wonderful. Next time maybe I will have the Al pastor or chorizo. And price it can't be beat. Tacos are $1.62 apiece, so for tacos loaded with meat and onions and cilantro on doubled corn tortillas plus soda is eight bucks total what a deal",

    "text": "This place is awesome! If you read a bad review, especially about the one across the street from a Taco, you are talking & reading about the wrong place.  This Tacos Jalisco (the real one) is on 68th Street, not on Thomas.  The location on Thomas is their original location which they sold, and in the contract had to allow them the right to use the name.  The food is not even close!! So make sure you check out the correct location on 68th.  You will be happy that you did.  The \"free\" pickled veggie bar is awesome, be sure to grab some of it in a baggie on your way it to accompany your meal. Another great one is the pace across the street next door to TD Road house.  Their Carne Asada is unreal, or the chicken that they grill outside over coal.  a Whole chicken, pint of rice, pint of beans, pint of home made salsa, like 10-12 corn tortillas, $10!",

Spoiler alert, it totally is, and their red salsas are probably the best salsas I've ever tasted. Knocking off one star for kind of a weird soap smell every time I walk in there which to me is really unappetizing - I don't think I'd be able to eat inside the restaurant, and one other issue - gristle bites. Every now and again I'll be biting into my delicious carne asada burrito and sink my teeth into a HUNK of gristle. Now I don't eat tripe or chicheronis or anything so this may fall into the category of 'white girl picky', but biting into a chewy, disgusting gristle bite really ruins it for me. I've unfortunately come across 1-2 gristleritos on my burrito escapades there and have promptly thrown the remaining burrito in the garbage gagging. I will say that if you detect a gristle bite early and can spit it out before it hits your molars, you can go on your merry burrito eating way. Gristle or not, Tacos Jalisco is HANDS DOWN the best hangover lifesaver in the entire world. Filibertos is for children. You want to reclaim your dignity like a champion, it's Tacos Jalisco all the way.",

It doesn't compare to some of the amazing Mexican I've had in Tucson, but for Scottsdale, it was pretty good.  It's a dive, 100% a dive, but the best Mexican places are.  The carne asada was good as well as the tortillas.  They had horchata, which was also very good, if a little on the sweet side.  My friend had the chicken, which received rave reviews.  I will be back when I'm craving some good authentic non-frou frou Mexican food.",

Between the two of us we enjoyed the carne asada, churizo, pollo and carnitas tacos as well as the chips & guacamole. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. We especially enjoyed the salsa that came on top of the carne asada tacos (also available at the salsa bar), it had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.   If you're in the area, this place is definitely worth trying out. I wish we could convince them to come to NYC!",

The carne asada is very tasty--maybe not the best I've had, but VERY consistently good. Their chicken is also very consistently good.  The biggest winner for me is their tripas; I have never had tripas as good anywhere else.Even if you're turned off by it, I'd highly recommend trying it at least once. I can't stop by this place and get less than 5 of their tripas tacos.  Also their horchata is fantastic!! You can't not get one with your order.

They serve mostly authentic style Jalisco Mexican Food. prices are unbelievably low and the food is Legit! I know as I've eaten tacos in Jalisco a number of times. They make everything in house - the tortillas, rice, beans and even all the vegetables and sauces on the salsa bar.  We shared a bunch of chicken and carne asada tacos ($1.51@) The tacos are double shelled (just like in Jalisco) and seemed double stuffed with lots of flavorful tender meat. They also garnished the plates with some chips that came in handy with the salsa bar.  We also shared a Chile Relleno Plate. They gave us not one but TWO Poblano peppers stuffed with mild melted white milky cheese. The peppers were lightly battered. This plate also included flavorful rice, creamy beans, avocado sauce, salad and tortillas.  We had a mountain of food, a beverage and it all cost only $22.71 with tax.  Great Value!   Authentic Style Food that's very good!    4.5 stars",

The food and asada was moist and good like everyone has stated.  There was a couple of girls that came in and were screaming from them crawling on their feet. The young ladies that were behind the counter just laughed and continued to take orders.  I cant comment on the food to much because I didnt get to finish my food, I ended up leaving after seeing cockroaches everywhere. The fact that they werent doing anything about the infestation and just laughed about it made my stomach turn. They thought it was also funny that we had left because of it and just sent one lady to sweep the cockroaches off the walls and floors and throw them outside..  Never again..  I will update my review because the owner seems to say my review was invalid. Im sorry that the owner feels the way he does but when I was there with my mother and a couple friends it was NOT a beetle and it was not just one insect. Maybe he was referring to another incident or situation but I did not come in at night nor am I just giving a bad review to give a bad review.Good or bad I give a review when I find a place going through Yelp. My friend, mother and I spent money at an establishment that turned out to be a poor experience. As I stated in my first review I had no other problem except for what I saw. Just because my experience was not 5 stars does not make it invalid and its not given to tear down a business. Its simply my review and experience, people can take or leave it. Taking reviews that are good or bad humbly is important, instead of attacking the customer saying their experience was invalid?",

Some of the best tacos I've ever had, and definitely the best I've had locally. I loved it so much that I went back for dinner and had a carne quesadilla that same night. Everything is so fresh from the tortillas to the fresh home made salsas. Oh and the best part is that they have the glass bottles Mexican Coca-Cola! I'll be back for sure.",

You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.    I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.    While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapenos, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.  One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.    The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....  My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!",

The Salsa Bar also has fresh cut limes and radishes, as well as a SPICY RED SALSA and various other toppings.   2nd- Main Course  I love tacos- who doesn't?  The carne is seasoned perfectly, and served on double stacked corn tortillas- topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro. This is my personal favorite way to eat carne asada.  I have also tried the al pastor, spicy shrimp, and chicken tacos- all of them were also delicious.   Oh! THE ROLLED TACOS  Try them!!  (I order them w/o tomatoes...) They come loaded with guac and sour cream, rice and beans.  3rd- RICE & BEANS  YUM! Try these. Just because you won't regret it!",

Previous reviewers are correct in that the salsas are all absolutely delicious, especially the verde. The carne in the tacos is not very good quality, and tasted about a half step up from ground beef to me. I think why people like it is because it was very fatty meat. The beans were awful-- very little taste at all and soupy consistency. The rice was just as bad. I drowned both these sides in salsa just to make them edible. Great that you can enjoy with a Mexican Coke (no beer though). Parking's a bitch but made up for it with the ability to dine watching telenovelas.",

    "text": "Hmmmm. I know everyone else seems to think this place is worth 5 stars, but I have to disagree. And after my experience, I read the other reviews that were 3 stars or less and they had the same things to say that I did so I know I'm not completely out of my mind. Maybe since it's next to a dive bar, the people there get really hungry after a few drinks and they don't know any better.   I've been spending a lot of time in Mexico lately and have been eating some amazing inexpensive Mexican food. So I do know what it is supposed to taste like. So here are the specifics to back up my claim. Torta-Wrong kind of bun. They should be on bolillo bread, something with some bite to it and chewey and crusty, not a soft, mushy, square shaped hamburger bun kind of bread. Beef tacos-well lets just say they did not taste like carne asada. There was no flavor of either a marinade or the charcoal grill it should have been cooked on. Tasted like it was just chopped up and cooked on a plain old plancha. The rice-it just tasted like rice cooked in a lot of Caldo de Pollo instant bouillon. The beans-they were actually ok. Maybe even homemade. Still had lumps of whole beans in them (a good thing.) The fresh salsa bar, nice and clean and fresh with a good variety of fresh veggies, limes, salsas. The only problem is that the marinated veggies had way too much allspice in them which overpowered the tanginess. I can't speak for the chicken tacos because I didn't taste them so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   Would I drive all the way there again for their food? (30 minutes one way) No. I'd drive all the way to Mexico before I'd waste the time and money on this place.",

Obligatory hole in the wall comment...  I haven't had issues with service like some other reviewers, but I agree that it's nothing special. Everyone was friendly enough and I think a certain \"gruff\" comes with the territory. It's a small place that caters to locals (i.e. workers on lunch break and Mexican American families), not tourists or retirees. So I think for me that negates any concerns with location and service as expressed by others.   In any event,  the food is what stands out here. When you first walk in there is a bar with various pickled veggies and salsas. Try the radishes! The menu is long enough to satisfy varied preferences but not so long as to overwhelm. I've had most things and everything is great! As mentioned,  carne asada is good, but I think you can do better. The tripa is great, lengua is good (crispy exterior, melt in your mouth interior), and the sweet pork is outstanding. Rice and beans are solid and the crema and Mexican mayo taste sooo homemade. I like salsa verde quite a bit and probably use it \"improperly,\" but it's great on everything.  If you are the kind of person who looks beyond the surface and appreciates really good Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out. NOW!",

It's teeny tiny and it's only because of Yelp that we even knew it existed and then decided to actually walk inside. It was Cinco de Mayo and we felt the need to enjoy some authentic Mexican cuisine. We turned to the trustee Yelp mobile app, Tacos Jalisco popped up so we thought, \"why not!? Yelpers approve, so it must be good.\" We pull up to this divey little hole in the wall Mexican food shop off a residential street. We walk inside and they have pictures of food on the walls with numbers next to each one. I decided to order the #10 which was a quesadilla and a taco and my husband ordered the #7 which was the Carne Asada. I definitely won in the ordering department and that typically never happens.   My quesadilla was pretty tasty and the accompanying taco was small enough to provide a taste without filling me up too much. However, the thing that stands out the most is their tortillas. They are homemade, authentically Mexican tortillas. Large and in charge tortillas. Buttery and soft tortillas. The #7 Carne Asada comes with a whole lot of meat and then a large tortilla. The meat is tasty but it could have used some cheese so it might be worth it to ask for cheese to be added. The quesadilla was just as a quesadilla should be, cheesy and yummy.   I would say that this place is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for some cheap, good Mexican food. It would be great if you are recovering from one to many drinks, or you're in the midst of having one too many drinks. It's also good on just a fatty day!",

Kind words to the business owner, have a sit down with your cashier and tell her to find another job if she does not want to represent the front of your restaurant in an appropriate way.  All it takes is one bad experience for a customer to not bring you their business again, and that's all it took in this case.

For that reason alone I'll definitely be a returning customer, the authentic Mexican food just happens to be the icing on the cake (pretty sure they don't have cake, sorry bout it).  Sure, it looks a little sketchy outside, but in my experience that's how you know the food's gonna be good, especially in the case of Mexican restaurants. Inside, the seating area is much cleaner and well-lit. There are two menus: one in English directly above the counter, and one to your right in Spanish. A bit overwhelmed by all the possible combos, I decided to work my way through the menu numerically, starting, of course, at combo 1: burrito and taco with carne asada. As expected, most combos come with refried beans, rice, and a small salad. I have to say the asada in my burrito was a little soft, rather than the crispy, fried asada I prefer, but overall the experience was pretty good.  Definitely going to need to try a torta next!",

The avocados were excellent. And for 10 bucks for three tacos and a large Coke it was a great deal.  Sadly I'm leaving the Scottsdale area but this is definitely a place that I would haunt.",

    "text": "Great service and good food!  Ordered the 3 taco plate, which is more than enough food for 1 person! It comes with rice and beans, lettuce and tomatoes salad, and an avocado side- not really like guacamole but avocado salsa? Also, chips and salsa.   There's a salsa bar with 3 different salsas, with the green tomatillo one being the spicy one. The salsa bar also has pickled peppers.   Plenty of meat selections for the tacos- including the authentic kinds, like tongue, tripe, pork skin, beef cheek. But it also has the regular meats, chicken, steak, marinated pork, etc. You can chose corn or flour tortilla. Tacos are topped with cilantro and onions.   It was real tasty but kind of on the greasy side. Nevertheless, still good street tacos.",

    "text": "Sometimes a hole in the wall gets recognition on yelp...well, just for being a hole in the wall. I can't stand it when people give anything over 3 stars to a place like that. Their Yelp accounts should be banned and writing privileges revoked. So let's sum this up dish by dish.  Beans and rice have the flavor of a pesticide. Not just any pesticide, but the kind used to kill only the fiercest of roaches. I have never had beans nor rice that taste this bad. The flavor is not comparable to anything, but the emotion is only comparable to that of returning to Taco Bell after not eating there for a decade. If you haven't experienced that feeling, I hope you never do. Consider yourself a very lucky person.  The camarones rancheros were mixed with french fries. Who thought to mix shrimp with french fries? And after disgusting inventions like that, people here comment that this is \"authentic\" Mexican food? Either they've been eating from a garbage can in Tijuana (in which case, they aren't lying about authenticity, but what else have you tried mixing shrimp with? A syringe?) or they simple don't care. The only decent thing here was the lengua tacos. Simple, no frills, decent lengua. For desert, tried the tres leches. It's a relatively simple dessert that I didn't think would be easy to mess up, but it was \"the worst\" (grumpy cat voice). Barely moist, tasted like a synthetic mix cake from Walmart. Just horrible.  To my surprise and to highlight a positive in this ruined dinner, they do take American Express. Most joints like this don't. However, that ended up as a double edge sword since otherwise I may not have come here. Stay clear unless this is the only thing open, then get Lengua tacos.",

Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds, its fine. But the meat is definitely juicy compared to a lot of places in this area. I'll be back again, fairly soon.

There were two women working the front- both glared at us and made me extremely uncomfortable from the beginning. The one lady was standing near the cash wrap and literally glared and looked me up and down several times before ordering. The lady taking my order was worse- had a smirk on her face the entire time and the worst attitude. Got our food to go- doesn't stop there. I ordered 3 enchiladas that hardly had any sauce on them- very dry and smothered in sour cream. Not at all like the experience I had before but I will never return to this location and highly recommend you think twice. There are much better Mexican joints that treat you with respect.

This place is definitely a hole in the wall joint and I actually passed it. You pretty much need to look for the Circle K and it shares the same lot. I was impressed that they had some of the \"unusual\" meat options like beef head meat and beef tongue (my faves). I came in hungry and ordered three tacos (two lengua/ one cabeza) and a bean & cheese burrito. I thought the meat kinda lacked salt, but the salsa from the salsa bar improved that. I enjoyed that the salsa bar had pickled carrots, califlower, jalapeno mix. Other then that the salsa was ok. The bean & cheese burrito was substantial. I actually could only eat half of it, which was challenging cus it was gud. I will be back to try more items and hope to improve my rating.",

I was skeptical of the Styrofoam trays, and not sure if the lady taking my order understood what I was ordering (I had to repeat myself a few times), but what came from the kitchen was exactly what I wanted on my trip to Phoenix.    Carne Asada came highly recommended, as did the quesadilla, so we followed suit and were so pleased  Carne Asada is so well seasoned and chopped, with a just that little  bit of char that you really look for. I could have used more tortillas, but I made do.  The quesadilla came with a a little carne asada taco on top, and was enormous.  It was not the typical one big flour tortilla folded in half, and grilled, there was much more thought put into this than I really expected.  How much thought can you give to a tortilla and cheese?  Apparently more than I had considered.   Plus, it came with a little carne asada taco on the side, which was an unexpected bonus.  It came with guacamole (don't order a side of guac unless, you really need a quart), beans and rice. the beans were good and the rice was fantastic.    Ambiance, was pretty basic, table wobbled, chairs were simple, and Spanish language music videos were playing on the TV, but that kind of added to the charm.  I'm from the north (and not Latino), so I don't have a lot of quality Mexican food to compare it to, but it shall now be the mark by which all other Mexican food shall be measured.",

Like...rotting seafood on the pier, terrible. However, the food is pretty decent. I ordered a #7, which is 3 tacos (I chose carne asada) and the fixins. It was simply mediocre. Good beans and rice, but I found the flavor in the Carne Asada lacking. It's good bang for the buck, but I drove 20 minutes from my hotel based on Yelp's ratings, so I feel slightly disappointed. However, I really enjoyed the bar next door, the \"Closing Soon Saloon\" (which has been open for 26 years, ironically).   Bottom line: Don't make a special trip, but if you're staying in the area, and want good bang for the buck, hit 'em up.",

A sizable portion of the tacos were inedible grizzle, and the bean burrito banished the only chunk of cheese to one small section on the bottom, growing like a small cold tumor from one side. The chips were store bought and the bottled sodas were nearly expired, which is completely mind boggling.

They taste just like your authentic Mexican street food should taste like. Filiberto's doesn't even reach the ankles on this bad boy. Besides the food being so flavorful it's a steal the food is incredibly cheap on top of that your tacos are loaded with meat they do not skimp out. Some of my personal favorites are the carne Asada burritos or chilie relleno or al pastor burrito for tacos try the carne asada/al pastor /tongue or tripe you'll thank me later!",

I tried their Combination # 3, a platter full of goodness: a torta and 2 tacos chock full of delicious beef tongue. Of course, it came with rice, guacamole, beans and a small salad. All I can say is this was seriously good cooking.  The eating area is smashing but clean and service is friendly.  This one is definitely for the books",

All were amazing (not to mention their awesome home-made flan and horchata!). I'm so glad I found somewhere decent and authentic!!  Side note: they only take cash!

    "text": "Easily the most authentic Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Their carne Asada tacos makes you want to freeze time so the deliciousness can infiltrate your taste buds. They have a pretty stellar salsa bar. I love their dark red chipotle salsa. It's got heat paired with a nice smoked chipotle taste which makes the pain of the heat totally worth it. The only thing I would say is, I am a little skeptical of the cleanliness of the restaurant. The building itself is old and could use a good remodel to liven the place up a little. Well worth the trip!",

The only downside is this place is tiny and the location is a bit on the bad side. The employees aren't rude but theyre not super friendly either. Regardless, I believe the food speaks for itself!",

The place was very clean and the staff was super friendly.     I ordered the 3 enchilada platter, not able to order a single enchilada & taco plate. Enchiladas only come in an order of three. They were good and were served with an abundance of lettuce and tomatoes on top. They even came with chips which saved me from purchasing an order. Also, mine were served with sour cream, and they provided plenty of it back-and-forth across the enchiladas.    Staff recommended which salsa to use with the platter and they were spot-on.    I will definitely be back when I'm in the area and needing a place to grab a bite.",

Overall, this place is for sure a hole in the wall and not the nicest location to the naked eye. However, they have decent food. We liked the carne asada tacos. Unfortunately, the side dishes that came with the meal wasn't that good. The beans and rice we tried were \"meh\". My husband was craving the flan which we tried... not a fan. Just too sweet. They have some dine in seating but not a lot. Also, the parking situation isn't the best as they share a small lot with other stores so many people were doing take out that we saw there. We would not go out of our way to go back. However, if we were around the area and craving some tacos; we may stop for just the tacos.. a la carte. We also tried the horchata drink which was something I haven't had before...it was good. So overall, a solid place to go for those late night out snacks or for something quick if you are in the area and hungry.",

We both ordered the same thing - Chile relleno burrito. We requested no lettuce and added French fries and sour cream. They accommodated our request and provided the ultimate burrito! Along with their green and red salsa, I couldn't decide which one was better for the burrito; I kept swapping between the two. They were both very good salsas! The burrito itself was exactly what I was looking for. I loved that rice and WHOLE pinto beans were already included in the burrito. My boyfriend called it the best Chile relleno burrito he had ever tasted. There was so much flavor that for him, he ended up only using one container of salsa because it didn't need the additional flavor.  The lady who helped us was also very nice and attentive when we walked in. Considering they were 30 minutes to close, I'm happy we were able to have dinner made by this place!",

My wife wasn't too hungry and mainly kept with rice and tortillas but loved it nonetheless. I opted for a burrito-taco platter. I went w/ el pastor in my burrito and chorizo in my taco. The burrito was the best I'd ever had--el pastor meat cooked to perfection, crispy on the tips and tender in the middle. The enormous tortilla was stuffed full of it with a little onion and pepper all of which made for a juicy, simple, delicious burrito. The taco was delicious as well and eaten too soon! The rice and sides were all fresh and tasty. The free salsa bar complete with warm hot peppers rolled in salt is ON POINT. Prices were ridiculously inexpensive. If I lived in the area this would be my weekly takeout joint.",

After looking at the menu, I decided to keep it simple and get what I wanted the whole time. I ordered a carne asada taco and two al pastor tacos. We got it to-go but there is tons of seating there as a side note. I packed myself some limes and the darker red salsa that looked like it would be spicier than the other red salsa. We drove home as fast as we could to chow down on our tacos that smelled so good.   So opening up my bag I was expecting 3 individually wrapped tacos but all 3 of them were wrapped together in tin foil. It took a little bit of effort to figure where each taco started and ended and it made my tortillas soaked in juices. I was a little irritated about the tacos but it was soaked in meat juices so it tasted good so I guess it could be worse. The actual tacos tasted amazing. The meat was tender and so flavorful.  The lime and salsa on top just made the tacos perfect. I loved both the carne asada and al pastor equally. The salsa I chose had a smokiness to it. It had a little heat but wasn't as spicy as I was hoping. It had way more flavor than I was expecting though. I really liked the salsa a lot. I'm glad I had extra salsa. I am going to put it on a dish I make at home. When I was done eating, I wished I had 3 more tacos. I will be coming back here at some point for late night tacos.",

We ordered all tacos with \"everything\" on them and they were so good, they didn't need any additional salsas, etc. They ask you if you want your tacos with everything and I don't know what \"everything\" is because I didn't ask (so sorry). I assumed their tacos come with the usual options of onions, cilantro, and salsa and I was okay with that. I ordered the jamaica and my hubby the horchata and we both found our drinks very refreshing.  We originally came here looking for street tacos not knowing what kind of a place it would be. It's not a taco stand but rather an actual sit down restaurant where you place your order at the front and wait for them to call your number. The restaurant is clean, updated, and I felt very comfortable eating there. We will definitely be returning to try other menu items.",

The tacos are chucked full of meat and cheese, they never skimp on anything they serve you. The beans are smooth and creamy and add some of the hot sauce, perfect dip combo! I always order extra when I visit as I have moved out of the area years ago, and it's along ways over.

I chose not to partake in anything from the condiment bar, that will be on the next visit.  The beans and rice were good.  I was extremely disappointed that they did not sell beer, and I can't believe that a fast-food Mexican place closes at 12 am.

The quesadilla was pretty good, and more than enough for most large mammals.  But the star on my dinner plate was the carne asada taco-- omg, it was amazing! Next time I'm getting the three taco combo.  Their tacos are just right.  Not too greasy, not too spicy (although they'll make them that way if you ask).  Just the right amount of meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce for maximum flavor.  They have fresh cut limes on the salsa bar-- absolutely essential for my taco enjoyment.  Be careful of the marinated carrots, they are really marinated and hot, hot, hot.  They're flavorful, but you might be regretting that choice later on.   If I have a complaint, it is only that they don't have a coke fountain dispenser,  only cans or bottles.  That can become rather pricey if you get a hold of something spicy (especially if its unintentionally!)   The prices are reasonable compared with similar restaurants in the area, although a bit pricier than what I'm used to.  For whatever reason, Mexican food is more expensive in Arizona than in Texas or Kentucky.  This place is better than most if the Mexican food I've had out here, though, so I'm not going to gripe about it too much.  If the quality is there, I don't mind paying a little more.   The quality is definitely there, and I will be back for more!",

    "text": "My husband was looking for Milanesas. So, we came to this place since they were the only place in Scottsdale that I could find that had any on their menu.  My husband ordered Milanesas, with rice and beans.  I ordered a burrito and taco combo with carnitas.  The Milanesas were not cooked to order.  They were dry and brittle looking.  The meat was paper thin.  The beans were like Taco Bell beans; they were of a watery substance.  Their carnitas were boiled and tasteless.  My burrito had nothing BUT carnitas in it.  Who does that?!!They serve their combo meals with a side of lettuce and tomatoes with a dollop of mayonnaise.  Pretty strange if you ask me.  The only thing I enjoyed was the horchata.  Thaaaat's about it.    After going to a few places in Scottsdale, looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food, I have officially given up.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the horchata was really good.  Other than that, the place is a hole in the wall FULL of flies.",

I ordered the #10 which is a carne asada taco, a quesadilla, rice and beans. I went for the taco first. Their tacos are small but mighty. The meat was tender and the salsa had a kick but was no overpowering - very flavorful. Next was the quesadilla. Granted, it's hard to mess up melted cheese in a tortilla but definitely hit the mark if ooey gooey cheese is your thing.  I thought the rice and beans were really good too. Dipping the quesadilla in the beans made it that much more awesome.   The staff was very friendly - they greeted us right away when we came in and thanked us on our way out.   I'm very much looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other kinds of tacos - chicken, al pastor, carnitas - yum!!",

(They each had a carnitas / carne asada combo, and while they liked the carne asada, they were over the moon for the carnitas.)  Anyway... seriously good eats here.

First off how many drunken people eating here or take-out (like my meal) thought that the giant dollop of white stuff on top of my patch of lettuce was sour cream? I'm guessing 99% and until I actually find the one place in some random corner of Mexico that uses this technique, let's just say this is weird and luckily I had read reviews first. #sourcreamplease      The quesadilla and asada taco combo was my choice, but I thought I had said I wanted the carne asada taco, but she said \"Ok beef? Yes, they are the same, but not in the Mexican world. The meat did not taste like asada or any other meat I have tasted before, including \"beef\". Either way it had no fat and was double wrapped and decent. The quesadilla was big and standard fare for these things, but better than the chains version. The rice was high quality and fresh radishes are always a nice touch.Whether I slurred my words or we had a translation issue we will never know, but overall the place appears to be better than the chains, but that's about all.",

I am a carne asada taco aficionado and this place has the best tacos I have ever had.  (Maybe a few places in San Diego have come close). Just get anything with their red salsa and you won't be disappointed.  Everything I have ever had here has a special homemade taste, from the pinto beans to the tacos.",

Amazing salsa, and I would kill for the recipe to their cauliflower pepper mix! I just drove over and hour round trip thru 3 different cities because my sister is visiting from Washington and it's a must have when anyone comes back to Arizona! Same friendly staff working since the first day I was lucky enough to find this hidden gem! Quick service and delicious food! My only complaint is that they're too far away! Sometimes the hole in the wall spots are the best kept secrets! But judging by their expansion and how busy it was on a Sunday afternoon.....it's not a secret anymore!",

    "text": "When I moved here back in June 2016, I found this place right down the street for me.   Before I could get my kitchen together and cook in the hot summer weather, I came here to eat.  The food is good and very reasonable, even with the recent price increases, the first in many years, I've been told.  So, despite eating here at least five times a week for the first couple of months here, and being a regular since, I have never tired of this establishment,  In the past fifteen months I have eaten almost everything on the menu.  My favorites are the tacos, the soups, the seafood tostada, and the salsa bar.  The tacos are a bargain at $1.60 each.  I love that they use two tortillas for each taco, ask if you want them with onions and cilantro (yes!), and that there are numerous taco filling options. My favorites are carne asada, al pastor  and lengua.  So, I get my three tacos with chips, hit the salsa bar filled with three salsas, radishes, cauliflower-carrot-pepper mix, and grilled hot peppers, get a horchata and pay less than $8 for a complete, nutritious meal. What a deal, and it all tastes scrumptious.  Another favorite is menudo, available on Saturdays and Sundays until it runs out.  If you want some, get there early,  This stuff disappears fast.  I love when the menudo is made with tendon--fantastic.  The seafood soup is also lovely, with all kinds of seafood, corn, potatoes and cabbage in a well seasoned, slightly spicy broth.  It is one of the priciest items on the menu, but still a good value at around $12.    This place sells Mexican coke and other Mexican drinks, and has tap water for those who don't want to pay for a drink.  It's frequented by primarily Mexicans and a fair amount of gringos.  It does a brisk business, is clean and modern and has an extensive menu.  Go in, get some tacos, radishes, and peppers, a Mexican coke, sit back and enjoy!",
