The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping? I was totally unsatisfied.",

I've had 'authentic' Chinese a few times since moving to the valley, mostly due to having a Chinese coworker or two that knew where to take us for the good stuff. I have to say, out of all the places I've been, this is probably one of my favorites if not the favorite.   The atmosphere is great, very laid back and quiet, looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but the inside is pretty nice. Not fancy, but more of a quiet, dimly-lit (but tastefully so!) place to isolate yourself from the rest of the world for just a little while.   The food on our visit was absolutely excellent. I had a bit of everything, shrimp, tofu and beef and they were all fabulous and the best I've had so far. I literally could not get enough and ate more than my fair share of our family style spread.   It might be a little out of the way and it doesn't look like much from the outside, but this is a great place. The service was awesome, friendly and very attentive and the food was fantastic. I would definitely go back and hope I can find and excuse to head out that way sometime soon!",

I had the won ton soup, house fried rice and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The won tons were cool in the middle and the soup had frozen veggies in it - I have never seen won ton soup with peas.    The house fried rice was flat and greasy.  My dinner companion commented that the house fried rice was more like what you find on the east coast, if that means anything to you.  The sauce ion the broccoli was twice as salty as they soy sauce.  Frankly, I was just really unimpressed.  I won't be back.

    "text": "I was traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for training and staying at the Best Western Plus about a mile away. The hotel had advertised this restaurant,  the reviews were great and I decided to go there. I went there wanting to just take my food and eat it at the hotel room where I could get comfortable but I can honestly say I took longer deciding what to order than it took for them to actually hand it off to me  which makes me question the integrity of how they make their food since I ordered the beef crunchy noodle. The customer service was horrible, no eye contact, no courtesy when speaking directly to the customer, and I know they had the potential for it because there was a woman sitting besides me which she was greeted by a warm,  loud hello followed with laughter and a full blown conversation while I was just handed my food followed by a hurried \"bye\". I get to the hotel and guess what? There was no fork included with my order but luckily the hotel provided me with one.  Hoping that the food was going to be as stellar as everyone had posted and have my troubles compensated by the taste of this food... I can say I was sorely disappointed.  The beef was chewy,  it tasted overcooked, it was just disguising eating it that I just ended up throwing the food away.  It was a waste of time,  gas,  and of $10.29 out of my account but lesson learned. The fortune cookie was tasty though :)",

Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, \"Hmm\" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.  There are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here.",

The service is always great and they give you just what you want.  There is a tall slender gentleman who is the greatest waiter and very accommodating. The problem is the owner. We have been coming forever and not EVEN ONCE has she said hello or goodbye. She is always short and on the rude side. No smile. Nothing. Sometimes we are unaffected by her but other times she is so rude and annoying we vow not to come back....but then, ,like masochistic Capastrano swallows ,we return because we adore the food. ;) We do come far less than we would normally for such good food. We come about 4-6 times a year. I wonder if she realizes that a friendly gesture or a smile would have us there far more often. I have a friend who is visually impaired and she refuses to go with us because she says the owner gets very resentful when she brings in her service dog. She always acts like she cant wait for the customers to eat and get the hell out quick. Whatever you do dont go for a late dinner because they start vacuuming 45 min before closing and you will eat your Dim Sum to the humming of a Hoover. Anyway food is what counts and it's really very good so 5 stars for the food and 1 star for the socially inept owner.",

My wife and I lived in the SF Bay area for 14 years so we have made our way around a Chinese menu or two. I try to stay away from the obvious Americanized menu items and take suggestions from our server as to what is fresh and special.  I have never been disappointed with their suggestions off the Chinese menu and regular menu. Sometimes you will get lucky and they have fresh mushrooms, clams, crab, whole fish etc...I have a soft spot for anything noodle and their \"dry\" chow fun is one of my favorites.

Appetizers came out in less than 5 minutes after ordering and were extremely hot. I somehow expected spring rolls to be served with a sweet and sour sauce, but the low lighting is deceiving--it's ketchup. Entrees were similarly served quickly (I would estimate within 5 minutes of appetizers). Portions are large and food was extremely temperature hot. Rice was meh (long grain white). Noodles (lo mein) were saucy but vegetables tasted off. I would say they and the rice were likely steamed or cooked in Phoenix tap water (X_X). Chicken had great breading and sauce but the meat itself was extremely fatty. I know these dishes typically use thigh meat but I was chewing on skin and fat. Overall I left feeling a little disappointed, considering how many good reviews this place has.",

They were both pretty solid, I liked that the sweet and sour pork had a lot of pineapple chunks and not drowning in sauce.  The Mongolian beef was almost too salty but just almost.  Good flavor for both.  I'd definitely try this place again for some actual Chinese dishes.",

    "text": "I honestly am gagging thinking about the food right now. The service was fine; the waitress (I think it was the owner) was extremely nice and answered all my questions. I would literally take a couple sips and a server would come by and top off my water. I was very hungry and this place had several full tables when we walked in. I was excited to try this place out. After we ordered, we only waited about six minutes before the appetizers came. During this time, I noticed a waiter come out of the bathroom with trash, stuff it in a larger trashcan by the server station, then grab plates, napkins, silverware, and a table cloth to go set a table. This was highly unsettling since he just touched bathroom trash. I was too hungry and thought, \"well, it wasn't *my* silverware...\" (how naive of me). The spring rolls were piping hot except they served a ketchup and horseradish mustard with it, which is not my preference on condiments. I asked for a different sauce and they gladly brought it over. The meat dishes were bland, some of the vegetables tasted off, and the chicken I ordered was very fatty and I'm not sure if the chicken was actual chicken meat. It's not that I'm complaining that the meat could've been dark meat versus white meat. Some of the pieces I had tasted like, well, tendons and some were just fat or skin. At the end of what I could stomach, I didn't want to waste the food so I got a doggy bag. I ate the leftovers a while later and the saying that \"Chinese leftovers are never bad\" has now been debunked for me.",

They changed chicken or something, because the 3 chicken dishes we had, were all tough, chewy, rubbery, dark in color and just plain disgusting.  I'm so sorry to say this, because we love this place and the people are awesome, but if they are trying to cut corners and are now buying cheaper chicken, it shows and it ruins everything.  The service was still wonderful, but I'm afraid I can't go back with this type of quality.  And we told them we didn't like one of the dishes, (being polite and not saying all 3) and they just said okay, I will see.  Whatever that means.  Back to the drawing board.  Where next to go for Chinese food......?",

We started off with West Lake Beef Soup. It is very similar to egg drop soup, but with lots of minced beef, tofu and a lot of cilantro. Delicious!   For the entrees we had many different things...String beans with white garlic sauce, eggplant with garlic sauce, fried tofu, fried poor chops, crispy chicken, shrimp with walnuts, shrimp and scallops with croquets, Peking duck and West Lake Duck (West Lake Duck was ordered a couple of days in advance). Everything was really good. Shrimp and scallops with croquets and the fried pork chips were my favorites. I am a huge duck fan and this was very good, but they chop the duck here so there are too many bones to deal with.   The vegetarian entrees were very good as well. The string beans with white garlic sauce and eggplant are two vegetarian items I would order again.   I really wanted to take lots of photos of the food, but just wasn't comfortable doing so with this large group and as I said, I wasn't hosting.   The do have a bar. Service was excellent. Clean restrooms!  I will come back here for sure.   Enjoy!",

I like how they cook it together! With onion green/red bell peppers and pineapple !!  Best spot for sweet n sour chicken in my book! And I'm VERY.. NO. EXTREMELY picky! lol only con is I think they're a lil pricey. This was a lunch special and it cost me $8 for a portion size that's not very much. At least it's good!",

I ordered egg rolls, won ton soup, and the house special chow fun.   The egg rolls were decent. Nothing bad or exceptional. The won ton soup was a little below average. As noted in someone else's review, the broth is basically chicken stock. Not much depth in flavor. The wontons were a little bit dried out and chewy. I've had much worse, but I've had much better too.   The big problem was the chow fun. I ordered it wet but I think the noodles were overcooked and soggy. But even worse, the seafood was very overcooked. The pieces of fish, shrimp, and especially scallops were so rubbery. I was not impressed with the freshness of the seafood or the cooking technique. I managed to eat most of it since I was really hungry, but I should have ordered the beef chow fun.    I don't think I'll go back anytime soon. The Chow Fun at South China Restaurant (now Joe's Diner) on 7th ave blows it away. Even the rather mediocre chow fun at Lucky Dragon on Thomas was better than Super Dragon's version.",

However, that was when one of our lunch crew was a guy who wouldn't venture out of a 5-mile radius for lunch and was a pretty simple eater. That guy has moved on and our options for lunch have expanded, so it had been a while... today, a few of us decided to pay our respects.   Super Dragon is consistent. It was simple food, reasonable lunch special pricing, fairly quick to get in and out and they're willing to split your check at the register.   We've had really good experience with service (although, sometimes we feel rushed when we're paying). Our glasses are always full and food orders are delivered quickly.   I must confess, Chinese food is not my favorite... so that probably contributes to me only being able to give it 3 stars.",

We just know the names in Chinese and from the Chinese menu. We can give it generic names like roast duck, roast pork belly, beef stew, Chinese broccoli, walnut shrimp, etc. It was good and authentic. Price is not bad. If you know how to do it right, you can come here with a group of people, order an authentic family style meal for a reasonable price.  A good way to test it is if it's not on the Panda Express menu, it's probably authentic. Although I love PE's beef and broccoli. I don't know why but I love it.",

Love the white rice that comes in separate bowl so you can  add rice as you like! I also got a order of Crab Puffs as my appetizer and they were nice and crunchy but not to the point where it's like biting into a rock yuh know! Overall very amazing!

I ordered a takeout shrimp lomein, the soft pan fried noodles. Ok, ok, I know it's pan fried, but as I dish out my noodles onto a plate, the noodles were literally dripping in grease. I ended up not finishing my food and throwing them away. I could fry an egg or two from the grease that was dripping from my noodles as I plated them.   In terms of taste, the food was pretty tasty. But, I couldn't take another bite from too much grease. Woke up the next morning with an upset stomach from the grease.   Never again! I think I'm going back to green juicing again.",

The vegetables are always fresh and never mushy or overcooked; always a bit \"al dente\" the way I like them.   The pan-fried dumplings, shrimp with broccoli, and almond chicken were just perfect when we ordered delivery last week through DoorDash.   Service has always been good when we've eaten in house.    I don't understand the recent \"greasy\" comment at all.  Nothing has ever been greasy; quite the contrary.  The food has consistently been less greasy than most other Chinese restaurants.",

I came here originally 6-8 years ago and now my whole family comes here.   Everything is good here; I absolutely love the orange chicken, one of my favorite dishes I've ever had anywhere.

I've eaten Chinese food all over the city (and all over the world) and this place consistently ranks among the worst. Mongolian Beef? Try Mongolian Mystery Meat. All of the supposedly beef menu items that I've tried have been tough and stringy, I dread to think what kind of meat it really is.   The spring rolls have the texture of  dried cardboard. Moist cardboard would be an improvement.      My sister loves this place for some unknown reason and as a result I'm often dragged here for birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations. After 8 visits, I've started eating before I go to this restaurant and when I arrive I'll have a beer and nibble on whatever looks sort of safe.     I'm willing to concede that it's just me. Perhaps I'm a snob and I'm the only one who's bothered that the pan fried dumplings are soggy and the place just doesn't seem to be that clean.  After all, it's fairly packed when ever I've been there. Lots of Chinese customers... that's supposed to indicate good food, right?   Despite the audience of loyal followers, I'm not even remotely impressed. And don't get me wrong, I'm not going here expecting Pei Wei of PF Changs, I'm looking for authentic Chinese, sans Jogging Cow. My advice: Look elsewhere.",

In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back.",

It's close and authentic. The staff is friendly, the food is consistent.  It is lacking in atmosphere but I'll give that up for consistently good food.

    "text": "Like another reviewer, I had lived in the Bay Area for years, and have fairly extensive experience with Asian food. This was incredibly greasy, and the flavors were drowned out by the oil. I had the appetizer platter as a meal (shared with my companion), preceded by \"hot-and-sour\" soup, which was neither. The \"spring rolls\" were what I call egg rolls and the filling was greasy - it was as if they were fried at too low a temperature, allowing the oil to be absorbed into the food before it finished cooking. The paper-wrapped (well, foil-wrapped) chicken was of a strange consistency - it was almost fluffy, like ground meat bound with egg and poached. The crab puffs were oily and their filling was a sticky paste, albeit flavorful. The tempura shrimp (when did tempura become Chinese?) were oil-soaked, like the spring rolls. The beef ribs were very gristly, and the beef skewers were OK - probably the best item on there. My fellow diner had the orange chicken, which had good flavor, but the consistency of the orange-peel bits in the dish was really hard - I chewed some for the flavor but decided I didn't care to swallow them, any more than I would deliberately swallow olive pits. Only white rice was offered with the orange chicken. We stuck to water and hot tea to drink, and the tea was good - plus it helped cut the oil and get the greasy taste out of my mouth. The service was fine, it was a Tuesday evening and not too busy; the cost was fair for the amount, if not the quality, of the food. I am a big fan of chow fun, and several other reviewers mentioned that theirs is good, so I might go back to try that, but since it has taken me six years to get there this first time (since I moved back to Phoenix) it may take a while.",

Beef on a stick good, tempura shrimp good.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid. Ribs were surprisingly large order for an app, and delicious.  Then came the duck! Beautifully presented at the table, then carved to perfection by a pro. Crispy herbed skin, succulent, perfectly cooked duck. Very nice server prepared crepes for us, adding sauce, scallions, duck, and folding into pocket. Side of pork fried rice completed this excellent meal. Tea was kept fresh and hot. Plates were cleared as used. All around great experience. Would highly recommend this place for an old school, professional Chinese style meal.",

The dumplings were good. A little greasy but we got pan fried so that's expected. Next time I'll ask for steamed. Then our sizzling rice soup cake. It was more like a seafood egg drop soup. But it was very flavorful and the sizzling rice came out perfect!   My husband ordered his go to: beef n broccoli. It was very good. And I ordered the hunan shrimp which came w a lot of vegetables and jumbo shrimp that isn't deep fried. Overall, I was very happy w the flavors and all the food. Will definitely come back m try something else!! Also not greasy like what others complained about. It's Chinese what do u expect???",

The inside really needs to be renovated and it is starting to feel like stuffy inside.. the carpet must be at least 15 years old, no joke. With all of the new development on the area Super Dragon needs to get with the times before they miss out on new customers. Although I live in the west valley I'm still a regular customer. I love the food but the place needs a face lift. Here are our favorite items to order: House fried rice, Kung pow 2, orange chicken, lemon chicken, sizzling rice and the low mein.. all dishes are made to order(I believe) and always taste fresh!",

A lot of Chinese restaurants don't even offer it and some require a 24 hour advance notice, but here it took less than 30 minutes for it to be presented to our table and the gentleman proceeded to expertly carve it for us. It was delicious! The owner, Kam, was a pure delight and we certainly will be returning soon and have already talked it up to friends who want to join us. Great find! Bill T. Phoenix",

    "text": "Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.  The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.  The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.  I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.  It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well.",

The few times been here for lunch the food has been nominal. Decent but nothing that stayed with me, except that typical post Chinese-lunch craving for a massive nap.   Service...well, depends on the server. Some are friendly, some not so much. Prices for the lunch special hover around $5.50 and include egg flower or hot & sour soup, entree, fried rice, and the greasiest egg roll that ever egg rolled.   Chinatown this isn't, but Grandma Ethel would love it. Actually make that plural Grandma Ethels. They were all over, rockin the place.",

Everything tasted totally \"off\"... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my \"check engine\" light on immediately).  *This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with.

Contrary to Bobby Q.s' experience, I actually had really good service, and mediocre / decent food. We found the staff very friendly and attentive. The food came out in a timely manner, and our glasses were often filled.  We ordered BBQ pork lo mein and the House's chicken. The texture of the lo mein noodles were just right -- almost al dente. But the sauce was way too salty.   The House's chicken was basically fried chicken breast, with a vaguely Chinese-spiced brown gravy on top. The menu claimed the sauce was spicy and garlicky. It was neither.   I do like that they serve passion fruit China Mist iced tea there. I probably drank a gallon of it during the course of the meal. Though, that might've had something to do with that salty lo mein too.   I am not ready to give up on Super Dragon yet . I would like to go back some day and try that duck. Plus, it is the best, Western-most Chinese restaurant I have found so far.",

I do know we usually get a dish with bokchoy and mushrooms, and a tofu/mushroom dish (SO GOOD!!!!), sweet and sour pork, and not sure what else.  And the food? You see those 4 stars, right? I prefer the food here to many other Chinese options in the vicinity. Service is fast, the bathroom is pretty clean, the food is tasty. the prices are quite reasonable as well.  For a la carte options, I recommend the Singapore noodles (thin rice noodles stir fried with seafood and bbq pork, all in a delicious dry-not saucy yellow curry sauce) or any of the chow funs (flat wide rice noodles stir fried w a variety of meats/veggies).   And if you like to be stuck in your little \"Panda Express is my favorite Chinese food\" world, they do offer Americanized \"Chinese\" food too.",

The menu has a large selection with options ranging from your favorite staples to combinations you have never heard of.  The service was 5-stars, very attentive and helpful servers.  It probably didn't hurt though that the restaurant was pretty slow when we were there -- which is odd for 7:30pm on a Saturday (made me a bit nervous in fact)!  My biggest complaint was the lack of atmosphere.  I don't expect a lot, but it was pin-drop silent the entire time--no music, no background noise, just quiet.  We could hear conversations at other tables and felt like everyone was listening to us as well.  We were there as a part of a birthday night out for a friend, so it wasn't a good fit for our mood expectations.  May I suggest some overhead music just to get the mood going?  Or takeout.....",

All of it was delicious, though we ordered the kung pao shrimp to be hot/spicy and it wasn't. The only things I wasn't crazy about were the ribs and this weird bread thing that came in tin foil in the pu pu platter. The ribs were very sinewy and fatty and the weird bread slash fish slash cheese triangle (no clue on earth what was in there) was rubbery. I'll definitely come back to try more of their menu, but I probably won't order the pu pu platter again.",

    "text": "Been going to Super Dragon for eons now.  Anyone who says the food is average or just ok.  Is not a Chinese food connoisseur, for sure.  Everything is great from the pu pu platter to the  beef and broccoli and everyone's favorite sweet 'n sour pork.  The egg rolls, regular and vegan and the crab puffs are really good.  Always get hot tea and fortune cookies too.  But what makes this place so good and the food taste even better is the service.  Second to none. The owner is there to seat you and make sure you are taken care of.  She is so cute, and her accent is just even cuter.  She's fun to talk to.  The rest of the staff is just as friendly and attentive.  Always a nice experience.  When getting take out.  I usually enjoy a beer from the bar while I wait.  There's always someone else coming in for a take out order to talk to while you're waiting.  Just a great place with great food.  I would highly recommend them to everyone who likes chinese food!  If you're not in China, you can go here!",

    "text": "This is a True treasure in my neighborhood and some of the best Chinese food I have ever had!  They have a great dinner combo we normally order, consisting of Mongolian beef, house chicken in garlic sauce, and pork fried rice which comes with soup, a shrimp, a crab puff, and an egg roll.  They also have complimentary hot tea.  The portions are huge and we always have enough left over for 1-2 more meals.  We tried the Cantonese pan fried noodles with chicken and kung poa vegetables, and both were phenomenal.  I am warning you now, the pan fried noodles are highly addictive, I couldn't stop eating them and became overly stuffed.   The service is excellent, they bring water out immediately and are always on top of refilling your drink and clearing dirty plates.  The inside appears clean and the table cloths are changed after each customer.  The menu is massive with so many choices of beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and vegetarian dishes.  If I were to move away from this place, I would definitely be back often...it is so hard to find great Chinese food and this place is definitely top notch!",

When I called it in they surprised me by stating that it'd be ready in ten minutes.  (again, I ordered a LOT of food) So when I skeptically walked in barely 10 minutes later to find it sitting on the counter  - they had me sold.  Both the orange beef and orange chicken were delightful, only note - I recommend ordering them both extra spicy, but that's me.  The kung pao shrimp could have used a few more shrimp, but name a place where that isn't True.  All in all, fantastic take out experience - I will definitely order here again.",

Food was definitely hot, temperature wise. Water doesn't taste very good. Husband got the shrimp egg fu young, came with a very dark sauce, not gravy like he's accustomed to. He didn't like it and ended up asking for orange chicken instead which he said was ok. I had kung pao chicken. Not enough veggies or peanuts (which seemed kind of stale). They were kind of stingy with the steamed rice too. Chicken in both dishes, for me, was stringy chewy. Won't be back.",

I'm giving this a five star purely for the house special crispy pan fried noodles with seafood.  They are very generous with their portions with fairly large shrimp, fish, calamari, and best of all a couple pieces of jumbo scallops.  If you are a seafood lover  this is a must get.  The sauce is incredible in its flavor and compliments the crispy noodles.  My 10 yr old daughter is not a fan of seafood, but she loves the sauce  with the noodles.  I've tried several other entres in my numerous visits, and they are consistently very good especially for its location considering it not near any of the little asias in Phoenix.  Like others have noted,   service is very fast and very friendly and consistent. Pricing is a good value.  Again,  Crispy pan fried noodles is to die for an excellent choice for $12.00",

Anyway it didn't taste fresh and was very bland and very fishy ,egg drop soup had a very slimy texture actually had to spit them both out on plate. lost my appetite at this point and asked waitress it she could take this off the bill as I did want anything else . She said she didn't think so and would check with owner . She returned and said owner said no but I could replace it with something else. I really didn't want anything else but settled for the leomon  chicken . Chilli Sea Bass was about $ 24 egg drop soup about $5 and Leomon Chicken about $13 , couldn't  get adjustment on bill and we did leave a tip. Needless to say we wont be back here again or recommend to anyone even though Leomon chicken was okay the next day.",

The cod was cooked nice and soft and was not too salty, like most make the dish. The duck was fantastic. It costs a buck or two more but you can see why it's worth the price.

My husband got something with rice, chicken, pork and shrimp combined.  I have never reviewed the water before but honestly, it reminded me of the water we used to get right from the spring.

The veggies were still crisp, the chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce was very well done. Husband had the Szechuan pork, and he said it was the best he's ever had. We had the lunch specials that came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The soup was very flavorful, nicely thickened, and broth based rather than some I've had that are more creamy. Now the egg rolls...since we moved to Phoenix I've been severely missing the crispy egg rolls from our old go to Chinese place in Chicagoland, not anymore. This place nails it. The owner told me they hand roll them from scratch everyday, it shows. They were crispy (think spring rolls), not greasy, with a nice veggie filling. They give you a little cup of sweet and sour with a dollop of hot mustard. They are delicious. Everything came out quickly and piping hot, the staff was very friendly and attentive, the restaurant is very clean, and the prices were beyond reasonable.

    "text": "Never been disappointed!  My wife and I have been visiting Super Dragon for our chinese fix since we lived a few miles down the road and decided to check them out.  Though we've moved to a few other neighborhoods in town, we find ourselves making the drive back to 12th and Northern when we are in the mood for good chinese.  The service is always prompt and friendly, even if they are busy.  The quality of the food is consistent.  I often order the house chicken, which has become a favorite of mine, but we're always happy to try new things on the menu and have not been let down.    My only gripe is that they aren't open for lunch on Saturdays, but that's not annoying enough to cost them a star.",

    "text": "Wanted to bump them up a star since the wonton soup and fried rice are not really bad and the nice lady who took my order on the phone remembered me.  However the soup's broth was basically plain chicken stock, and needed soy sauce and pepper to make it tasty.  The fried rice had a good amount of seasoning and meat, but it was extremely greasy/oily.  I've never had fried rice with this much oil!  A copious amount coated the interior of the white takeout container as I moved the rice into a plastic storage container.  The pricier version of the soup, the wor wonton, is even less desirable...bland, overcooked veggies and meat, sadly.",

    "text": "Well shoot. I ran over to this place after a customer of mine went onnn and onnn about this hidden gem. I scoured yelp to find the most raved dish and side and went with the house chicken & crab puffs. First, I need to address the looney tunes Yelper who called the chicken spicy and flavorful and the crab puffs creamy and delicious. You, my dear, must have like three taste buds. The house chicken was blaaaand and the crab puffs were very likely a mess up from the kitchen. There is no way those weren't just fried wantons. Please folks, if you will, picture a pea in your mind. If there was more crab/cream cheese mixture in those wanton wrappers then that pea, then I'm a monkey's uncle- clearly impossible as I'm a chick and human. A less important side note, it was $20 for these two items. Coulda, shoulda, woulda had a filet at work for less. Three stars for good customer service.",

    "text": "After reading mostly good reviews, we figured Super Dragon would be a good fit for our Asian American family of two adults and two kids. We weren't disappointed. We called an hour earlier to see if we needed a reservation, but were assured it wouldn't be a problem. We arrived for Sunday lunch at 12:30 and were given a table right away. While we decided what to order we were given ice water and hot green tea. We ordered 3 entrees for the four of us and everything came to the table in less than 10 minutes. The food was fresh, well prepared and tasted very good. Even so, it was too much food for us and we had to take around a third of it home. Total came to around $40 including tip. Definitely good value and we'll go back there again. It's True it could do with some renovation work, but the food was very good, so we didn't care about the decor.",

    "text": "The food is fantastic. Some of the best cantonese (pan fried) noodles I've had since San Francisco, & when I ask to add snow-peas they provide ample, so worth the extra $2 for my special request. House comes with shrimp & scallops, as well as large pieces of fish, squid, chicken, pork... the pork fried rice is really nice (think american chinese food fried rice) with some veggies & egg mixed in, just enough, but especially appreciate the added touch of bean sprouts throughout. Their cantonese duck is so wonderful I've not tried their peking duck, nor crispy, but am sure it'd be just as meaty. Yes meaty, duck! The meatiest duck I've ever had, & just as great a flavor as those from china-town windows.   The service varies from excellent to uncomfortable. Some nights warm & welcoming, fast & courteous, helpful with suggestions, another visit, later on Saturday night - not so much. They are open until 9:45; if you come in at 9, they'll seat & serve you, but unlike previous visits where the server explained & even provided recommendations, the server seemed flippant & & snotty when we tried to discern which duck we always got. Thank gods we figured it out on our own!  They always bring your food fairly fast, although if you ask for the white rice ahead of time they look at you like you're going to take off & ditch them after eating it, & they didn't bring it in a nice container (you know the ones with the lid with the little cut out for the serving spoon) like they usually do, but in a cold bowl, & the rice was - cold!  As was the hot tea - not cold like iced tea, just like tepid, not even luke warm, just like it had been sitting out for hours, & they resented bringing hot - all this at 9 o clock. Also they will start 'cleaning' and by 9:30 will make you very uncomfortable, even seeming resentful to bring you boxes to bring home your recently presented steamy hot food.   The ambiance is run down, but not dirty, nor in disrepair. The booths are comfortable, the tables solid, and they replace the cloths with fresh.It's a family friendly, dark but not dingy atmosphere, and if you come early & get the \"A team\" you will have a stellar experience. Either way you WILL LOVE the FOOD!  Oh yeah, except the fried pork rice we always get & love was really super salty that night we came \"late\". Other than that the food has always been great.",

Comparing the serving size to what my dining partner got in chicken makes me think the solution is just to not order shrimp. Everything tasted good though!",
