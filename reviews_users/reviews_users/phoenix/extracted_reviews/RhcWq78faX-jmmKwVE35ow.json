    "text": "Such a bad experience here. My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and we ordered at the counter as soon as we walked in. We sat down and for 30+ minutes we watched a women walk by with plate after plate full of food for 2 girls taking pictures of the food. I respect them for wanting to help these girls with their project but at the end of the day, they were not paying customers being served full meals FOR FREE while us and 4 other tables waited an extended amount of time for food we had all already paid for. After 35 minutes had gone by, an employee comes up to our table with my boyfriends food and informs me that my burger had been burnt so they had to cook another one. We waited at least 50 minutes before both of us could eat our food together. On top of the terrible service, not once did the lady who appeared to be the manager come up to our table and apologize nor were we offered a refund. We felt extremely disrespected and will never come to Shane's Rip Shack at Westgate ever again.",

The lady taking my order had to yell at them to be quiet because she couldn't hear me. She then said she was going to the back so she could hear me. I ordered 2 full slabs of baby back ribs and 2 lbs of pulled pork. My husband picked up the order and when he got home we all sat down to eat and found that they gave us 1 slab of regular pork ribs and 1 slab of baby back ribs.  I called immediately to tell them what happened and the lady told me that she made sure they put baby back ribs in my order.  I am 49 years young and have been eating ribs since I could walk. I know the difference between baby back and regular pork ribs. You can tell just by looking at the length of the bones. Word to the wise. Untie the knots in the bags and check you order before ever leaving the restuarant because once you're out the door you're on your own. They will not take responsibility for getting the order wrong.",

There was a huge portion of pork. I usually have no trouble putting down food, but this was a bit of struggle.   I went with beans and mac and cheese. Both sides were good and warm.  The only disappointing part of the meal was the texas toast. The toast was subpar.  It tasted like a piece of regular toast. Nothing to it. That's not texas toast!  Overall, Shanes is still a place I will stop by when I hit a hockey game and indulge in some good BBQ or chicken tenders.",

There's a self serve drink area at the back of the restaurant too with coke products and a whole slew of iced teas. The BBQ sauce options are limited but tasty and zingy.   Super pricey for what they have to offer and they take a long time to prepare a \"fresh\" burger (15-20 minutes). The jalapeno cheese sticks are spicy and super delish though and a must try!",

We arrived to dine in and noticed that the restaurant was pretty full and thought that was a good sign that it was a good place but we were WRONG.   My wife ordered a combo plate with chicken tenders, pulled chicken, 1/4 rack of ribs, and a couple sides. I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs plate. It took OVER an hour to get ribs at a barbecue \"rib shack.\" As we sat, we saw the restaurant empty out and fill back up and those new people got their food before us. I'd say that probably 5 tables with about 15 people got their meals before our two plates came out. One of the tables next to us had a guy get up and leave due to how slow the service was.  About 45 minutes into our dining experience, the waitress let us know that the food was on its way but that \"ribs take a while to cook.\" It sounds like the restaurant was not prepared to serve its customers. The food arrived about an hour and ten minutes after we ordered with the explanation that \"there were a lot of other tickets.\" Of course there were a lot of tickets, we were there watching all of the other tables get their food first even though they got there after us.  The food tasted ok. The chicken tenders were dry and stringy. The ribs were good and I had no issues with the sides.  The service was substandard and the waitress rarely checked on us in the nearly 2 hour dining experience. I got up to refill my drinks and we walked to the counter to pay because we would still be waiting for the check.  Overall, I do not recommend this place and will not be back.",

    "text": "After we attended the gun show at the stadium, we dropped by here for some lunch.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:  Big Dad Pork Sandwich <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA#uaownUdFQGAKZaJG7WVUVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>  Cole Slaw <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shanes-rib-shack-glendale?select=B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A#B_42MFpwDqaXiCEkn1253A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/shan...</a>  While we were waiting for our food, I noticed that there was a some BBQ sauce bottles by the drink station.  I wandered over there and grabbed a bottle of the Spicy and a bottle of the Mustard BBQ sauces.  After a short wait, we got our food and I put a little of the Spicy BBQ sauce on the Sandwich and took a bite.  First of all, the Spicy BBQ sauce is not spicy at all....it's not even mild or medium....there's more spice in regular black pepper.  The next bite I tried the Mustard BBQ sauce...that one had some good flavor to it and added to the meal, so I used it for the remainder of the meal.  The Big Dad comes with Texas Toast as the bread for the Sandwich and it helped hold it together well.  Overall, it was average.  The Cole Slaw I ordered for my side was ok...not as creamy as I prefer, but it was ok.  I'm a fan of BBQ and this place didn't leave me wanting more, thus the average 3 Star rating.  Return Factor - 30%",

    "text": "My first time at this Glendale location and had a Horrible experience! I should have left when I saw 2 flies at the register. I went to find a table but there was only one long table and it was dirty. The entire floor had food and napkins all over the place. It looked like an elementary school cafeteria. There was nobody cleaning the dining area. I asked the people sitting at one end if I could sit at the other end of the table. My husband asked to have it cleaned and the girl brought over a rag and wiped it off along with the rest of the dirty tables. The rag had an odor of mildew on it and the table smelled like mildew after she wiped it. I had to take out a hand wipe to clean it . Then she separated the tables into 3 . I didn't see any cleaning spray used and so I am not certain how many tables the rag actually was used on without being soaked in bleach or cleaner. Finally sat down at the table and waited for the food. Saw 4 more flies in the window. When the food came, my family and I had to stay alert swatting at flies the entire time. One landed on my sons cup. I was so disgusted By now that I couldn't eat the shredded meat because I figured that if there are that many flies in the dining room then it was more than likely that more flies were in the kitchen. My son went to use the bathroom and said it was nasty too. He normally wouldn't have paid much attention but the place was such a wreck. I know that it's summertime but for Christ's sake today can't be the first day it was like this. There are fans that can be put above the entrance so when the door opens it keeps the flies out. I have been to Shane's at Norterra several times and have NEVER had this experience. If I were Shane's corporate , I would be on the phone asking questions because that place is disgusting and we w NEVER go back to this location. As we were getting ready to leave , one of the young girls finally started sweeping up the floor. I only saw teenagers working there the entire time. At one point a man emerged from the kitchen area to fill his drink. That was the only adult I saw the entire time.",

I will also admit that I have a hard time giving a place 4 or 5 stars when they charge you $0.39 for a slice of white bread. I obviously paid it as you will see on the receipt but I find it tacky to charge for a slice of extra bread especially after spending a fair amount on quick dining food. I was in disbelief and asked the clerk and she snickered and said \"we don't make the rules.\" I'm guessing I'm not the only one inquire about this $0.39 policy.",

Order arrives and low and behold the ribs and pulled pork are covered in sauce.  When I explained to the server/mgr about the error I was told that ALL of their meats come sauced, except the fried  chicken tenders, they belatedly came with Ranch dressing.  Why weren't we told that when we ordered.  It was a simple request.  No Sauce please.  Geez.  The ribs, pulled pork and BBQ beans were sickly sweet and barely warm.  The chicken tenders while hot were as dry as a normal summer day in Phoenix.  The table sauces didn't help improve them at all.    Here's what I  know about BBQ.   A BBQ joint should smell like smoking meat, it didn't. Sauce shouldn't overpower the flavor of the Que, it did.    Sorry but I'd rather sit out in the 110+ degree heat at 95th Ave and Peoria where JJ's Louisiana BBQ parks his smoker and get my BBQ,  than return here.",

I ended up on this side of town, and after circling to see what restaurants were here at Westgate, I decided to come here, and I'm kinda glad I did.  I found out that on your birthday you get a free sampler plate, so I went with that.  They have a decent selection of items on the menu, and the prices are fair.  I asked what came with the sampler plate, and he told me that it was chicken strips, ribs, shredded chicken or pork and ribs.  Well, guess what, I don't want the ribs because I don't eat pork! I asked if he could substitute the brisket for the ribs and he said no.  MINUS ONE STAR FOR THAT BUDDY.  They have brisket on the menu, but I guess its a no go for the sampler, and don't bother asking to swap it out.  SHAME ON THEM! Ugh, so annoying!  Overall, the food was okay.  Fast casual environment, and if you want quick BBQ, stop in.  Oh, and don't ask to swap out the ribs for brisket on the sampler..lol",

It was pretty busy when we came in but found a table next to the window. The floor was ridiculously sticky like someone spilled soda.   Went to get drinks and everything tasted awful. I literally questioned if I should return my cup because all the drinks were terrible. The food came out half an hour later and portion size was pretty big. Food was okay besides the BBQ chicken nachos. Way too greasy. My brother wanted to get some ketchup packets and they were dirty! Like someone oozed honey or something sticky all over them.

While other guests who came in after me where served. I finally asked about my food, and asked for a manager. When I informed the \"manager\" (who refused to give her name) that I had been waiting for half an hour she actually pulled out the receipt and said \"No you've only been waiting 25 minutes, not half an hour. and you were told there would be a wait.\" I was shocked!! Definitely some of the worst customer service I've ever recieved. She was incredibly rude and didn't offer as much as a simple apology.   I won't be going back to this location, which is unfortunate as I ate here often.",

I have no complaints about the food but the service at times could be a little quicker. The decor fits the food and seating fits for a place that provides in and out dining. My daughter and I stopped by while in the area and she ordered the pork sandwich with fries and I got the pork plate with cole slaw and fries. Both of us enjoyed our pork and to me, it is always a solid dish to get here. We both thought the fries were fine but nothing to write home about. My daughter would not try the slaw (shocking , right?) but I thought it was good. We both are big sauce fans and were very happy to see four different barbecue sauces to choose from.

We have previously been in here when it just opened, and was really excited about the young ladies running the counter, as well as the food which by the way I got a burger medium rare. The fact that it's a quick bite and you can order a beer along with was definitely a plus. That being said, we walked in today and the young ladies at the counter where okay, until I ordered a burger that was medium rare and they mentioned that they were not able to make it that way, they could only do it medium or medium well. There was no way I was going to eat a burger like that so I ask for the manager, and the manager said that they were not allowed to do medium rare Burger. I cry BS on that. There are many restaurants within that area, and everybody from bowl and Tavern, Saddle Ranch, whiskey rose, all make a medium-rare burger with no issues. The minute she started giving me some ridiculous explanation as to why they could not kick out a medium rare Burger, I walked away and ended up going to Bar Louie which was phenomenal! See my Yelp review on that! I will not be going back to Shane's Rib Shack, and less I'm 100% sure I only wants the hot wings or ribs, and I am sure that before I order I'm going to have a conversation with a manager to ensure that I get great service, and great food. Whoever was the manager today, made them lose Revenue that I spent somewhere else. Not a very good manager at all.... Shame lol",

Unfortunately this last time I tried something new off of the menu and let's just say i understand why the prices here are so high. I tried the brisket sandwich with a side of potato salad and a drink. This ended up being a 15 dollar lunch for just one person which is just above average so I paid it hoping at least the sandwich would match the price. I've got to say I was a bit disappointed, the brisket has no actual flavor because it is drenched in bbq sauce now I'm from the south where we let the meat do the talking. Not the sauce. Now let's move to the portioning size I felt defeated trying to take a bite out of this sandwich as a half pound of brisket fell out of the bottom. they use waaaaay to much meat like it's going to compensate for the flavor and price. Using large pieces of Texas toast for the bun you cant really tell how big they actually are compared to the pound and a half of meat slapped on the bread it's just not practical almost wished I had side of fries to mix with all of the wasted meat that did not fit in the soggy bread. All in all I will be sticking to the smoked wings with my future visits here. I hope the owners can take notice to this issue as I would've have been much more pleased with a quality style brisket with a normal portion of food.",

    "text": "Went to Shanes last night about 630pm, place was pretty empty there was about 6 people sitting at tables and no one else waiting in line.   I had to wait for the Manger who was on the phone letting a member of staff know it was slow and not to come in.  Once he finished the call I was greeted friendly.  Started to make my order and mentioned the Groupon and was promptly told that the terms and conditions of the Groupon state no holidays.  It was Valentines day. I asked when that became a holiday as the financial institutions and government employees all had to work.  The Manager said Shanes sees this as a holiday as its on their calendar. To that I had a highlighted Groupon conditions thrust in my face.    Well their terms and conditions state cannot be used on holidays.   So I said it just says holidays and I asked again when did Valentines day become a holiday everyone had to work today.  I cannot believe I was not the first this manager had to explain this today as he was clearly frustrated and replied with even less tact than before.  Shanes see this as a holiday as it is on our calendar again thrusting the terms and conditions at me.  No apology, no tact, just plain we dont want your business attitude.  If any company hides behind terms and conditions rather than customer service that's a bad sign right there.   At this point I said maybe Shanes should list the days it considers holidays on the terms and conditions so the rest of us understand.    Seriously, my calendar lists St Patricks day, Bastile Day, Ramadan, Mexican Independence day, Kwanzaa, Passover, Channukah, Grandparents day there is always something listed on a calendar, not all are classified as 'holidays'.     Guess that's why your EMPTY on this holiday dinner hour here is another Yelp regular you have lost.",

One thing that shocked me and has never happened to me at a restaurant but happened here..... I was charged higher prices than the menu prices. To make it a combo menu said it was $2.99 my bill said $3.99, medium side said it was $2.99, my bill said $3.99. When asked about the error, I was told it wasn't an error and someone earlier  had also complained and the guy pointed to the small print that says \"prices subject to change\"..and then he mentioned because of the hike in the sales tax in Glendale????? This kid didn't know what he was saying! Bad way to do business, I don't even think that's legal for them to do that...I asked him so you can charge whatever you please? Wasn't in the arguing mood for $2, but I won't go back!",

We felt the pricing was a bit high for eating out of plastic baskets with parchment paper liners...   But when comparing it to the other two dominant BBQ joints out west, Dillon's (which is not to our flavor liking, way overpriced, paltry portioning, and sides that are memorable for blandness) and Famous Dave's (which has great sauces, but lacking in meat quality at times, with sides that are ok but not memorable) Shane's is our newest favorite. It bumps Dave's to a distinct second because the meat was absolutely tender and stands on its own without drowning in sauce and the sides (fries, sweet potato fries, and slaw) are better all around!  Regrettably, they are not close enough to home to simply 'swing by' for a  take out order!",

Let's start with the chicken. Bbq chicken has to see some smoke or at least a grill. You can not take baked chicken and put sauce on it and call it bbq chicken. Next the sauce. Maybe it's an Arizona thing but that was watered down ketchup at best. Onion rings were pre made. Mac and cheese pre made. I am guessing the chicken....wait for it.....pre made. Sorry Shane but when you travelled the country talking to family about good times and bbq you should have stopped into a bbq place here and there to see how it is done. And a person can purchase a franchise to sell more below average bbq. If your ever in Oklahoma Shane give me a call. I will take you to eat some mouth watering bbq that will have you refunding franchisees money when you get back home.",

    "text": "I don't usually bother rating chain or franchise restaurants as they're so variable, even from day to day, and I really wonder how much effect a review here has on a giant chain.  You shouldn't really expect highest quality food or service from a chain restaurant located in a destination entertainment complex, as this one is. Chains (franchised in this case) aren't going to be able to consistently match the intangibles that a dedicated mom and pop brings, and the employees are very aware - in spite of even the best manager - that guests are more likely to only be there one time and there are few 'regulars' to complain to an owner.  Having said that, I found this place to be better than its current 3 star rating, but not overwhelmingly so. I ordered ribs, which were meaty and tender. The sauce wasn't memorable and the spicy version really wasn't (spicy or memorable.) The cole slaw was creamy and very tasty, the potato salad almost as creamy and very tasty also, which I appreciated, and the portion sizes were fine.  My order took a little more than 20 minutes to come out, which is really a little longer than I thought it should take given that it was at 4:30, 110 degrees out, and thus the place was near empty. Not the end of the world, though. The place is a 'walk to', as it's in one of those centers where parking is on the periphery with all the shops and restaurants in the center, an outdoor entertainment mall.  Expect a lot of kids as it's probably dad's only chance to get something with a hunk of meat in it while mom and the kids shop/play/sight see.",

The citrus chipotle bbq sauce had an amazing flavor and good kick to it.  The sampler came with ribs, chicken tenders, pulled pork or chicken, and two sides, which I chose mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good. Very tender and flavorful. The chicken tenders had an amazing crust to them that went well with the sauce. You can choose to have the tenders mixed with the sauce or on the side. The pulled chicken was just okay, could have been a little more flavored and not as doused in sauce. Overall, it was good.   Definitely will be back if I'm in the mood for ribs and I'm in town again.",

The okra was also good. The real tough part here is that for some reason, cheeseburgers take 45+ minutes. That's right. Which, fine I'm okay with that HOWEVER this restaurant NEEDS to either indicate that on their menu or explain to customers while they're ordering. Everyone in our party had their food 20 minutes before we did. We watched so many people get their food. But the real kicker was when two people who had larger burgers than the child's burger we ordered and had ordered probably 15 minutes after, got their burgers 10 minutes before the single child's burger. There was one really sweet lady who worked there and tried to be kind about it but overall even though I did like the food I wouldn't come back or recommend if you are trying to get in and out within an hour and half. I hate being less than kind but I was really disappointed in the experience overall and lack of service from what seemed like the manager while we were in a frustrating position.",

The meat doesn't have as much smoke favor, but is tasty and not fatty like some places.   One cool aspect of Shane's is they have a number of options that appeal to our kiddos. They usually go for the breaded chicken tenders, but can also go for a simple cheeseburger or the Mac n' Cheese. Their pulled pork sandwich gets pretty good comments, as well. And my wife loves sweet tea, so it works that they have that.  You can come across a person at the register who will not wow you. On balance though, service staff are usually cool. I've also seen Shane's at a community fund raiser event, so happy to support a business that tries to give back to the community. No all do.  Definitely worth a visit...",

The ribs tasted liked they popped out of a frozen package and baked.  Shane's offers four BBQ sauces plus Carolina vinegar available at the condiment table. My take out order was prepared in  10 minutes. On this visit we order a full slab of baby back ribs and Mac and Cheese.  The Mac was okay. It was cheesy but dry instead of creamy. As for the ribs they weren't so good. The ribs were dry and on the fatty side. The ribs just didn't taste good, I was very disappointed.  Very doubtful I will revisit Shane's again but I like to think the pit master had a bad day.",

I ordered a half-rack and the ribs were literally falling off the bone- I barely had to pick them up. My sides could have been just there for filler and it still would have been a good meal, but the quality of the slaw and beans actually pushed this to a 5 Star review.

The woman at the register was kind and helpful, nonetheless.   The food is where this place falls short. The half chicken was actually very good. That alone I would give a 4/5. The mac & cheese wasn't terrible but subpar. But the ultimate disappointment was the brisket. I ordered the 2 meat meal and even paid extra for it. It looked like pulled pork and was by far worst brisket I've had. To be honest, I had never had a bad brisket until this.   By no means am I telling you to not come here, just stay away from the brisket, and go for the chicken.",

As it assaults your mouth with a sense of deep longing for some of that back slappin goodness just makin you sure u ain't gonna survive without any of it. Buuut just as you think it's just about over that feeling overtakes your brain an the rest of your senses and refuses to release its hold on you and causing Shanes RS to be an ever present thought on your mind. The only remedy and I repeat the ONLY remedy to make this feeling go away is to indulge in the only thing that is on your mind and to enjoy life to the fullest while doin so. So... what are you waiting for?? Head on over to Shanes rib shack and get you some!!!",

    "text": "We had dinner at Shane's. My wife and I brought our 3 kids with us as they have a great kids menu. Our kids normally drink milk which they don't have. I got the barbecue pork plate with baked beans and potato salad. The potato salad was awesome. My wife also got the baked beans and typically complains about everything but she like the baked beans which means they are exceptionally good. I was shocked at how much pulled pork I got for $10.99. The hot dog is a giant sausage that both kids liked and the cheeseburger my daughter got was delicious.  We stayed at a nearby hotel in Westgate and ate at a different restaurant and regretted it. Shanes is well worth the money and for dinner for the five of us we spent just about the same as we did at Wendy's. My only complaint if I had to come up with one would be the very small waiting area when you are waiting to order your food. We got lucky and beat the rush but there must've been 15 people standing behind us with the door open. I get it though real estate at Westgate must be ridiculously expensive. Overall five stars for sure.",

The line was long and the staff looked harried, but they did a very good job of handling the situation. The BBQ was above average for the area (let's face it, we ain't in Kansas City Dorothy)!   I had the sampler platter with two sides and was  impressed with the size of the servings and the quality of the food. The boneless wings were, well boneless wings. But, the ribs were well done with the right amount of BBQ sauce. The best, of course was the BBQ pork which made the whole meal!! I had the medium sauce and left without any heartburn, which means I should have had the hot so I could whine about it all night!   The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but if you are looking for something fairly quick and don't want another burger, Shane's is your place.  We will definitely make Shane's a regular stop when we are in Glendale.",

On their website:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shanesribshackarizona.com%2FPromotions%2FFamilyMealDeal%2Ftabid%2F61%2FDefault.aspx&s=0c2f87a31da1f302f501db298e2f8dc2a4c935194c4c18b39a0a69de0c80c56b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shanesribshackarizona.co...</a>  they advertise a $20 family meal deal for 1lb meat, 4 buns, 2 sides, 4 desserts and a gallon of tea.  Sweet deal right? When my husband went in to pick up take-out, the employees said there was no such 'deal' and the only $20 deal they had was their 4 Big Daddy sandwiches for $20.  He went ahead and got that deal since we were in the middle of a home improvement project and needed to get back to work.  When he got home, we looked up the 'deal' and sure enough there it was still on their website.  My husband called and got through to an employee after several attempts; she again said there is no such deal, but offered to give the phone to the owner.  When the owner got on the phone he first denied that the deal exited and after he was told it's on the website, he said it must be another stores website.  When we read the his stores address, unit, and phone number back to him from the top of the website, he gave up and 'thanked' us for letting him know that 'old' deal is still on the website and that he'd remove it.  He said they don't do that deal anymore because they don't have the gallon teas.  He then refused to honor the deal and make it right with us this time and only offered to take care of it \"next time\".  That's not how good customer service works.  If you make a mistake and then lie, lie, and lie about it, you need to fix the problem today....not \"next time!\"  And to think, we were even interested in the catering menu for an upcomming birthday; well, not anymore!!",

The full wall of windows facing the west had a light tint, but no shades to pull down to protect your eyes from the blinding sun-had to keep our sunglasses on throughout dinner.  It was already too late to leave, you order on the way in and pay up front, prices were as high as any full service place.  Two in the party ordered the ribs, the other ordered salads.  After more than 20 minutes, the food arrived in a red plastic basket.  The Texas toast that is bragged about is a thin slice of bread toasted one side only without butter or a spread; ribs were very dry with little flavor; side of green beans were too salty to eat ; salads were a head of romaine chopped in large pieces with 2 prepackaged salad dressings on the side and very little meat thrown on top for show.  If your in the mood for ribs, save your time and money by stopping somewhere along the way for take out and eating by the fountains.  **With food and service like this, it will be gone before your next visit to Westgate.",

As soon as we walk up to the counter to order, the person waiting behind us (we were the only people in line aside from him) asked why he had to wait in line to pay when he did a call-in order. So she ignored us, when we were right in front of the counter about to order and helped him pay out. Then another person who had just walked in behind him asked if she could pay for hers too. So the cashier took her order too, while still ignoring us. Then we did finally get to say our order and she had no life in her face. Given none of this took long but she didn't even ask before letting the other customers jump in front of us when we were standing right there ready to order and pay. Overall the food here is great. We shared a plate of bbq pork nachos. They were awesome, customer service not so much :/",

Ordered our tenders grilled due to dietary restrictions (which is why we asked so many questions about menu) was alerted it would be 15 minutes. After 25, inquired. Was told almost ready. 10 other patrons meals delivered.  After 30, asked to talk to manager. Manager would not speak to us, yelled rudely from kitchen & referred us back to cashier. Finally requested refund after 35 minutes. (Was not offered like comment states below ) Took cashier 5+ minutes to refund. So 45 minutes total and STILL no food, no manager. Awful!",

    "text": "I visited Shane's Rib Shack for the first time about a month ago with some friends and I have been back a lot ever since. The food is amazing best wing I've had in a very long time. Leaves a lot to say about their next-door neighbors Buffalo Wild Wings. Their wings are way better. You can tell the food is prepared with great care to be enjoyed by the customers. They have a lot of options they menu is simple but does have something for everyone in it. My boyfriend had a burger which he said was in his word's \"bomb\". They have great food and I think that's the reason why people keep coming. They have pretty decent pricing nothing too expensive. They are however a bit cheaper than most places here at Westgate making it a good option considering the food is good. My boyfriend and I have probably never spent more than 25 dollars for the both of us. Which is not bad all seeing as most places here we could possibly pay more than double what we would pay there.  The place is very small for the amount of people that they bring in. They have a very large social media presence which brings in even more people. The line almost always leads out of the building. There's rarely ever anywhere to sit because of how small the place is. There is usually about a 20 or so minute wait. It is very crowded place and even if you do get a seat the tables are very close to each other. When someone passes by your table they usually brush by your arm or hit the table. Which is why we usually will just order to go and sit out front by the fountains because there is too much going on in there. They should have really gone for a larger location that could accommodate more people.    When it comes to the service it was okay. They aren't really what you would consider to be friendly which I mean it's fine it's not really a big deal for me. I work in a fast pace place and I understand that the are extremely busy so I see why they wouldn't be very friendly. But I just thought it was a little weird when it was my turn to come up to the counter the guy kind of just stood there waiting for me to say something. He didn't really say hello or what would you like nothing at all. It was kind of awkward just because that is how things usually work when you walk into a restaurant. Then when we asked for something it kind of seemed like an inconvenience to help us. Basically, the only great thing about this place is the actual food that's great and easy and the decent prices. We will definitely go back all the time these are just the slight little details that don't make our experience so great.",

I was friendly greeted by the cashier who was very helpful with giving my group recommendations on what to order.  After just a few minutes wait, we took the food to go and eat outside. It was HOT to the touch and messy--everything you expect from barbecue.  The portion sizes we're good and priced reasonably. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the food was delicious, but not the absolute best I've ever had. I'd definitely come back again though!",

There were long lines trailing out the door at every restaurant. We kind of wandered around in a daze of overstimulation for a while and then we walked by Shane's set-up. They were offering chicken or pork sandwiches, mac n cheese, chips and cookies. Perfect!  I ordered the pulled pork, boyfriend had the chicken. We both ordered the mac n cheese. Now, it wasn't cheap. I don't know what it's like inside, but at the stand two sandwiches, two macs and one bottle of water will cost you $20. But we were hungry and I guess we were paying for convenience.  Luckily, the food was really good! Boyfriend did say his chicken was a little dry but my pulled pork was nice and tender. The sauce was flavorful and not too spicy. The mac n cheese was really good. Some reviewers said it was bland - I disagree. I thought it was rich and creamy with ample cheesy flavor.   The food filled us up for a night of rockin' out. I would go back and try sitting inside Shane's next time.",

I ordered the Smothered Pork Sandwich (coleslaw on the sandwich) with a side of baked beans, my husband ordered the pork sandwich on the texas toast with fries and my son had the cheeseburger.  First, let me mention that I hate it when the child menu doesn't offer the primary specialty of the place. My son ate half of my sandwich and not  a single bite of his burger. Perhaps my son is an odd-ball but he actually likes the same food we do. Next time I'll just order him a pulled-pork sandwich and call it a day.  The sandwiches were great and my son's burger was DELICIOUS. Their sauce is pretty good but I do prefer Honey Bear's sauce as I think it has a little complex flavor in comparison.  I think it will be a place we will use to pick up sandwiches on nights we don't want to cook - for sure.",

Twice I've gone mid-afternoon on weekdays and the place was not very busy.  The pulled pork sandwich I ordered was pretty delicious-moist with great tasting sauce!  Mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods ever and I always order it as my side, but Shane's version is lacking some flavor (think school cafeteria).    Unfortunately I cannot say that the food quality is the same on busy days.  I went on a Sunday for lunch, waited about 20 minutes for my sandwich and was extremely disappointed as it was bone dry and bland as could be.    Shane's is hit-or-miss, but has potential.",

El Paso bbq schools them on the beans, ribs and sauce and for roughly the same per person cost.  I believe Famous Dave's , least the one in Yuma beats them handily, as does Honey bears, as does RUB bbq etc.    Not that Shane's is  bad it's just there's nothing that stands out.You order on the way in, busy, noisy and hard to wrangle a toddler when the in/ out and ordering location are in the same place.  Food arrives reasonably quickly but plastic utensils and ribs do not mix, let's not even try :)  I want to give it 2.5 because there's just too many places I'd drive for this kind of meal for the same price in nice surroundings.   I miss Shoney's back in Ga , heck I miss most of the rib places I frequented in GA but alas the furthest west they've gotten is New Mexico.",

The girls working there recently are extremely rude, especially a short Hispanic girl. I went in at 10:55 a.m & they do not open until 11 a.m. She saw me come in she didn't even greet me but told me I had to wait until they open at 11 a.m. I said ok than 2 minutes later a huge family comes in, it still wasn't \"opening time\" and the other worker helps them and I was right in from of the line and she completely ignored me & didn't ask if I was next or needed help, which was extremely rude. The other employee who told me they weren't open yet and I had to wait saw the entire thing happen and didn't tell or correct the co-worker when she helped the other instead of me because I was there first. I have been a loyal customer since they opened up at west gate but due to the horrible customer service they been having lately I will no longer be going to Shanes & do not recommend anyone to go there.

We were definitely not impressed though! I ordered the Smothered Pork sandwhich and the Mr. ordered the Shack Sample with ribs, pork and chicken tenders. My sandwhich was just average. The pork was decent, but the cole slaw smothered on top was way too dry! It was more like cabbage mix than actually slaw. When I think of \"smoothered pork\" I think of the food and sauce just dripping over the bun. Not in this case. My husband's chicken tenders were very meaty, but a bit dry and not very flavorful. Their shack sauce definitely helped to improve the flavor though. The only thing I liked from his plate was the ribs. The baked beans we had as a side were okay. Mac and cheese was disappointing. Like Andrea L. mentioned, tasted like school cafeteria food. Too bland. Fries were decent.   I couldn't believe how packed this place was on a weekday night though. It must be the location convinience, having a theatre and arena nearby. I can't imagine people honestly being there for the food. Save your $ and bbq cravings and go to Fritzi's on Dysart!

The portions are huge, we took leftovers home and had enough for 2-3 more servings at home.   The food was very good, the meat fell off the ribs, so amazing.  I like that the ribs weren't drenched in sauce, just enough and if you wanted more they have several bottles of sauce to use sitting on your table.  the mac n' cheese was ok, kinda reminded me of KFC, just not enough of a cheese consistency for us.   I wouldn't call it fast food, it's above that we thought.  Their prices vary , we didn't think they were outrageous.  Honestly, you could order one plate, pick it up and share it between 2 people making it really inexpensive.  I didn't give it 5 stars because their bathrooms were disgusting and need a deep cleaning and then ongoing cleaning/spot cleaning a few times a day.   All in all, we will go back just for the food.",

This place is clearly aimed at people who don't really it BBQ.  I kind of figured from all the annoyingly kitschy signs and decorations all over the place.",

At first i was skeptical of the price for their simplest pulled-pork plate with 2 sides.  After getting my food, I was immediately surprised at how much food was on the plate. Huge serving of meat, Texas toast, and two fair sized sides. Worth it.  Food was good, not amazing. Had a bit of the obvious fast food/QSR taste and quality, but at least pulled pork and barbecue food isn't something you see a lot of in the QSR genre.  I'd eat here again on game night, especially to avoid the lines of the other places.",

To be fair, we haven't tried the brisket yet,  but we're getting there.  And they're Shack Sampler is enough for both of us to split without feeling like we ate a side of beef.

That finally changed before yesterday's Coyotes game.  Shane's is what it is.  Fast food Barbecue.  Not the best food I've ever had, but certainly not something that would regret.  The \"Big Dad\" is a nice big pile of barbecue pork between two big slices ofTexas Toast.  I really didn't care for the buttery taste of the toast, but the pork itself was very flavorful, and shane's \"secret\" sauce is wonderful.  It has a sweet flavor with a slight kick.  As a regular combo, it's about $8 for the sandwich plus a side and a drink.  I had the potato salad which was just okay, and decided to try their sweet tea.  If you love sweet tea, you'll probably really love Shane's.  If you're like me who poured my drink \"half and half\" (with a ratio closer to 60% unsweetened and 40% sweetened) and still felt that it was way too sweet, I'd recommend you steer clear.  Shane's is good stop before heading to an event at the stadium or arena.  Or somewhere to eat before or after hitting up a movie at the AMC.  But like everything else in Westgate, I wouldn't recommend it as something to go out of your way to try.",

    "text": "Went to Shane's on Saturday after the touch-a-truck event and orders food originally to eat-in but I asked our order to be changed to go @ 1:15pm.  Waited and the food arrived and we left.  We got home a 20 minutes later, noticed that one of sandwiches is missing...  I tried calling the number on the receipt and all I got was voicemail and not a call back. I tried a number of different times and still no answer. So based just on that, I am giving a poor rating  Feedback on the children's chicken tenders, they are way way to big for a toddler to eat and stringy.  They need to be half the size or a nugget.",

And when I think of brisket....I think sliced. No sauce. Not chopped and smothered in sauce. You can tell it is but it could be a chuck roast. The manager tried to accommodate but sorry this is garbage. Rather go to Rudy's. Not a fan at all.",

The pulled pork was so shredded looked like dog food! The fries were cold and many hard! The sweet potatoes were shriveled like they were reheated and cold! I guess the Texas toast was the best on the plate! Even the peach tea had NO peach flavour!!! I know my friends from out of town expected better because they have great BBQ where they live! We won't be going back, on the hunt now for a new BBQ place!",

    "text": "Tasty BBQ place!!!!  Food is really good considering since it's technically more of a fast food place.  The portions are HUGE.  The only drawback is that we went for kids eat free night (Wednesday's) and in order to take advantage of the deal you HAVE to order 2 drinks.  We pretty much only drink water but were forced to pay $2+ for a fountain drink each.  Kinda defeats the purpose of the free kids meal.  I'd rather kids meals just be half off and not have to purchase a drink",

The service was ok as they just bring you your food and you don't really need to see them again after that.   The fries were good, as was the chicken, though it was drowned in sauce that while tasting okay was so heavy that I found myself scraping it off to try and actually taste the chicken. My fault for not asking for the sauce on the side. I will probably try it again but it wasn't anything special overall.  Update: Went back and got the chicken without sauce. Much, much better. Though two people could easily share a 6 piece chicken basket. It's a lot of food. I would definitely go back when I'm in the mood for some chicken and fries.",
