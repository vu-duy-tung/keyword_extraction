The service was as incredible as the food.  From oysters, to shrimp, to Mahi Mahi, to the Barumundi..  All I can say is AWESOME.  A must stop for foodies.  The decor is of an old fish market...  Really works!!",

The sushi bar serves one of my favorites Hamachi Kama (yellowtail collar) Some of my other favorites are the fried oysters the prawns with pasta and garlic and the sushi selection is quite good.",

Although the idea of fresh seafood in Phoenix might seem a bit of a stretch, the seafood here is excellent. Sean took care of us, and was a delight He did a great job explaining different parts of and favorites on the menu. We started with roasted edamame, which was really good - a bit smoky. Be careful with the salads - they are delicious but big. My husband had the 'Wee' Wedge salad which, as Sean jokingly noted might be a 'Wee bit too big.' We both had Baromundi  - I had the special and Ric had the simple grilled. Both were great - perfectly grilled fish. We ended by sharing a slice of Key Lime Pie, which was very light and loaded with flavor. We'll definitely be going back - it's now our neighborhood seafood restaurant.",

I made reservations, confirmed the reservation earlier in the day, and showed up on time. I was then told that it didn't matter if I had a reservation, there was a 45 minute wait. Since going anywhere else without a reservation would result in the same wait, we said okay and my name was added to the bottom of the list behind any walk-ins. Once we were sat, we were told Cliff would be with us shortly. A few minutes later, a woman who I assume was not \"Cliff\" brought us water and bread. About 5 minutes after that she asked if we wanted any drinks besides water. Finally, after sitting for 20 minutes, she asks if we have any questions. At this point, we have been sitting patiently, menus down (universal sign for ready to order), for 20 minutes assuming that she was just taking up some of the slack because \"Cliff\" was swamped. We placed our order and then waited an hour for the food to arrive. My Miso Glazed Swordfish was pretty okay, and the wife's King crab legs (2 for $50) were decent. Her grilled polenta, on the other hand, looked (and tasted) like some frozen patty someone slapped on the grill for char marks. I'll admit, being put at the bottom of the wait list even though I had a reservation soured my mood this evening, but my wife and I were amused that the most enjoyable moment we had was when we realized we could finally leave after paying the check. All said, I won't be returning to this establishment until there is a big banner stating \"Under New Management\".",

I ordered the fire grilled Australian Barrundi with coconut jasmine rice and it was terrific.  The fish was perfectly prepared without a hint of oilyness.  The crab and baby arugula topping complimented it well.    For our appetizers we ordered calamari which was good, if unremarkable, however the steamed clams were delicious.  We were greeted with plates of sourdough bread that were hot and tasty and were kept filled throughout the meal.   As good as the food was, the service was really outstanding.  We were a party of 14, which is a challenge anytime, however our waiter Josh took great care of us.  He was on top of keeping our water and drinks filled, handled our special requests quickly and pleasantly, and got all 14 orders out correctly and at the same time.  He did a terrific job taking care of every need with a great sense of humor and professionalism.    I'd definitely recommend them to others and will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "My husband and I have eaten here twice in the last four months and both times were great! We have only done the late night happy hour at the bar, but I'm looking forward to eating there in the dining room soon.       The guy that works as the bar chef is great. Very personable, and helpful with deciding on which tasty options to choose. The first time we were there I had a Moscow Mule- Vodka and Ginger Beer with either lemon or lime- served in a traditional copper mug. The second time I had a Sakitini- 2 types of Saki with pineapple juice and triple sec- served up. Delicious!!! We tried a few different sushi items and appetizers both times and everything was great, very fresh. Great place to eat if you find yourself hungry after 9:30, reverse happy hour complete with tasty cocktails. Sit right at the bar and you can watch the chef prepare certain menu items while you enjoy a great drink.",

I always patron this restaurant in a large group and order up $100's in food. Only had been dissapointed once with Barramundi, a bit too bitter but I am not a Barrumundi expert as I've never had it before. We normally get oysters, Ribeye's, calamari, cioppini, shrimp cocktail and King Crab legs. This place never seems to dissapoint us. I don't know if their norm is to say Goodnight to all their customers, or just the ones who spend big money. We always get thank you's and have a great days from everyone in the place and Love it! Will keep returning back here and recommend this place to those who love High quality sea food. Even if you show up in sweats looking like you just got rolled over by muggers, they still treat you like you are royalty. Love that businesses now realize that even wealthy people do wear flip flops and dress down occasionally (totally exaggerating our clothes)...ha ha.",

Was kind of cafeteria-ish, so we sat in the bar like we usually do. Server was nice enough, no complaints, no praise. Sherry's barramundi was very moist and tender with good flavor. Calamari was tender as well as the clams in my chowder. If your looking for a place with lots of tv's and red lobster style cuisine with a little bigger price tag, this could be your spot. My favorite part was the real mounted great white on the wall.",

We started with the crab, spinach and artichoke dip. It was ok. I ordered the walleye and some vegetables along with New England clam chowder and he had prawn linguine and lobster bisque. The clam chowder tasted like flour and the lobster bisque was thick and flavorless. The walleye simply tasted like fish without any seasoning whatsoever. Everything was just room temperature like it sat a while before being brought to us. We were not pleased with the lack of flavor of the food. One thing I can say is you will never know if you like a place until you try it. Well, we tried this place and can cross it off our list. This is just what we thought so you may want to try for yourself because you never know until you try for yourself. If you decide to try it I hope you enjoy it more than we did.",

It also is not very spicy, which is fine but good to know if you like spice.   For lunch, I got a combo of one shrimp taco with a cup of chowder soup. The soup and taco were both very good and the taco had great flavor, once I added the lime that was on the side. I got a side of broccoli, which had literally no flavor or seasoning at all.  They should add at least salt to the broccoli. I am usually someone who thinks things have too much salt so when I add it,  it is under seasoned.   Overall, good meal, the chowder is very good.",

The best part is that the drive from our house was only about 10-15 minutes and there is a TW&M next door. Yes!  This location used to be The Fish Market many moons ago and and the upstairs was a separate restaurant. We always enjoyed eating here in the past and forgot all about this place until now. The upstairs is no longer a restaurant and it is used specifically for big parties and larger groups. Downstairs is relatively the same with the their fresh Fish for sale up in the front and several different seating areas to enjoy your meal.  The first thing we did was to check out the fish case. My wife really wanted Walleye and yours truly was wanting try something different. We both went with the pick a fish and two sides from the menu since we were not wanting anything fried. The rest of the menu offers several items that would please just about any restaurateur.  We started with an appetizer and picked the Seared Scallops served with a tamari glazed bacon, kaiware sprouts and wasabi aioli. It was so good we could not stop sopping up the drizzles on the plate with their complimentary sour dough bread. I'm going try making that dish at home.  My wife next ordered the Canadian Walleye that was lightly floured and cooked on the griddle. She picked the Herb and Goat Cheese Polenta and the Red Quinoa Salad for her sides. I went with the grilled Australian Barramundi which is a type of Sea Bass with the Herb and Goat Cheese Polenta and some Sauteed Summer Squash and Kale. Both plates were thoroughly delicious and we couldn't stop talking about how good and fresh they tasted.  Service was EXCELLENT and very friendly. We were seated next to the kitchen and could see the chefs cooking the fish and other dishes. Our server went out of her way and did a fine job answering our many questions as well as making sure we were enjoying our meals. She even said we could sneak upstairs and take a quick look if we curious on how it looked today. Cool!  Going to step out on a limb and say this was some of the best fish we have had in the PHX area and the prices were very reasonable as well. San Diego would have been our first choice but who has the time and money for that on a Saturday. Definitely coming back here again for a meal and would also like to try grilling some of their fresh fish at home. YUMTASTIC!  4.75 STARS",

Check out the patio when it's not summer if you're sensitive like me to stank.    Love this spot. Situated just above the 51, I'm shocked at how impressive this place is. Awesome selection of fresh seafood and shellfish. Lobster rolls are one of the most memorable items. Happy hour is a good option in the bar.",

    "text": "There are many places in the valley that purport to be seafood-only places that are absolutely dreadful in the execution of their meals, and/or their service.   However, neither was our experience while dining at this restaurant during this special occasion wherein we all found ourselves available to dine together for Sunday Brunch.  Right off the bat, our server Nelsy impressed us with her efficiency and her patience. We all arrived at separate times over the course of 40 minutes. And yet, she patiently and courteously waited on us over that course of time.  Once we had all arrived, we then spent even more time catching up before we even began to order. Our decision making abilities were hampered by the plethora of deliciously sounding options. It truly was a challenge to make our individual minds up. Therefore, we opted to just choose varying dishes and just shared them.  I will say their seafood dishes are superlative. There were none of those ersatz frozen dishes that had obviously been sitting in the freezer for way too long during transport. All our dishes were wonderfully prepared, and tasted quite fresh.  The clams, scallops, crabs, salmon steak, and the one chicken dish that we ordered were truly a delight on our senses.   And we finished it off with having some desserts. My creme brulee was both sweet, but not too sweet. Just how I like it.  Overall, it was a wonderful Sunday brunch experience worthy of the this establishment's reputation. The only thing missing was the ambiance of a body of water greater than an aquarium!  However, the company of my beloved wife and daughters certainly supplanted that atmospheric absence by a factor of a million! Along with the marvelous service, this place was a big hit with us.",

The shrimp cocktail was very good and done in a unique twist.  Wife got the trout with spinach and I got scallop kabobs with a side of vegetables. It was very good. And the sides were great!",

    "text": "When my husband and I moved to Arizona two years ago, we were skeptical that we would find good sea food. I certainly didn't expect one of my favorite restaurants here to serve sea food, but how wrong I was!  We've been here numerous times since finding the Bluewater Grill this past winter. We also make a point to take all of our out of town visitors here; it's by far one of our favorite places to eat in the valley. The staff is friendly and also very knowledgable about their dishes. They are always happy to provide recommendations when asked and to date haven't been wrong.   My husband and I have had tried a variety of things on the menu and don't have a disparaging word to say about a single dish. Their clam chowders, both the New England and Manhattan are superb. The Oysters Rockefeller is one of our favorites and the oysters on the half shell have always been very fresh and tasty. My husband typically gets the lobster, while my current favorite is their Barramundi dish. It is cooked to a delicate perfection, although every fish dish I've tried has been cooked well and very good.  We haven't tried the sushi, but the fish market selection always looks great and I haven't heard anything but good things about it from fellow patrons. We prefer to sit at the bar and have always heard good feed back from fellow customers. On that note, they have solid bar and cocktail menu as well. Would definitely recommend it. We drive from the west valley regularly to feast!",

    "text": "\"The freshest oysters in all of Arizona\" may sound like an oxymoron, but it's what Bluewater Grill boasts. They proudly showcase two types of oysters a day, one west coast and one east coast. That may not seem like a lot but hey, we're in the middle of the desert -- what do you expect?  East coast oysters are brinier and saltier. They sometimes have a funk that comes from the merroir (like terroir but for the sea). West coast oysters are sweeter and have more fruit flavors like cucumber or melon. Pick your style or try them all!  Happy hour prices are pretty good. On weekdays they're 3:30 - 6:30 and you get discounts on some food and drinks (including oysters!).  I also tried the King crab, which was delicious but very expensive. If you are sociable and make friends with the bartenders, they may be able to cut you a deal (half order of king crab, for instance).",

Nothing but crab meat and no fillers. Awesome crab cakes, I just wish they were larger. But still awesome. Almost ordered the grilled walleye but decided to return on another day to try that one.

I may as well have been on the coast at a shack watching my shellfish being shucked.  I followed with the fire grilled salmon served on a bed of cashews, avocado, cucumber, couscous and king crab salad with achiote creme. Yeah, it's as good as it sounds.  She had the seared sea scallops. Perfectly seat and seasoned served with a nice combination of spinach, shallots, mushrooms and white citrus soy sauce.

Their prices went up , understandable, but the portions got smaller and some of the food didn't seem as fresh , almost premade the prepared and plated. My honey and I used to treat ourselves to the Top Of The Market where upstairs they had a more formal dining experience. Maybe I'm being too judgmental based on a belief that if one place takes over another and serves the same food they should be equal in every way. The service is good , the place is clean and the food is ok. Got $$ to blow ? Then you won't mind it here. Personally I have to save up to indulge in an evening at a seafood restaurant and when I do I want the quality to be more than red lobster ( which any ethical seafood lover won't go to ) so I will be on the search for a new place to spend my very hard earned money.",

Far more fresh than any local grocer including whole foods.  It's a bit more expensive but worth it.  I have returned fish to many of the regular groceries around here after getting it home and taking a close look at it...so I'm so pleased to have found Bluewater, this is the only place I will buy fish from now on.",

Also tried the baked mussels which was very good.  The fried calamari was actually the best I had in years.  Also had the osysters rockafeller.  Have to say they were really good.  The only dine side was that you got more of them when it was Fish Market.  BTW, I shared all this food with a friend and we ate every peice of food it was that good.

    "text": "I'd been meaning to check out Bluewater Grill (probably for dinner) since it was still the Fish Market- I finally found myself here today with friends for Happy Hour. After this visit, i'll definitely be back again to try dinner!  Happy Hour runs from 12-5pm on the weekends, which is great for meeting up with people. There are enough choices on the menu that you can expect to fill up on food, all at Happy Hour prices.  I had our waiter ramble off the list of beers (a good amount which I hadn't heard of, intriguing!) but as soon as I hear the word \"Hefeweizen\", I know what i'm getting. I cannot remember whose it is, but it was tasty. Beer and well drinks are $4 at happy hour- I really wish they'd add some of their cocktails to the specials, they sound so good!  There were 5 of us, so I was able to try quite an assortment of food. (Note: Not everything we ate shows up on their menus online, I noticed the same is True with the beer.) The highlight of the appetizers were fried shitaake mushrooms stuffed with spicy tuna (same as in the rolls). They were wonderful- our server suggested coming back and asking for \"Jared's version\", which substitutes a crab mixture.   From the happy hour sushi menu, I ordered a soft-shell crab roll and a fried salmon skin roll for a total of about $15. After taking a few bites, I decided this was well worth the price, probably even normal prices. The crab was perfectly done (crispy legs but not burnt!) and the salmon skin roll, although it took awhile, was delicious. If you're a fan of California rolls, the one here is excellent and the crab tastes very fresh!  We also nibbled on crab artichoke dip, garlic fries, garlic cheese bread, and fish tacos. Overall, there was nothing we didn't like. At $4-5 per app, 2 (maybe 3 if you're going for a full meal) per person should suffice.   The service was good but nothing special (probably a little less than i'd expect if I were there paying dinner prices). It was the middle of the afternoon and not busy, but our server always seemed in a hurry to get somewhere else. He came by frequently, but I only had enough time to ask him for one thing (water, chopsticks, wasabi, etc.) before he was off around the corner. I suspect all his tables were getting served quickly at least! As we were wrapping up, we mentioned how wonderful the stuffed mushrooms were, and that's when he told us about the \"special\" version in full detail. This restaurant seems to have a lot of favorites and specials and history, despite its recent changes. Can't wait to go back, whether it's for happy hour or a meal!",

Bluewater is definitely worth going to for the fish. My mahi-mahi was devine and there were several other choices that had been flown in fresh that day. But really, my favorite part of the meal was the spinach. Call me crazy, but I would go back again just for a vegetable. Sauteed to perfection...not overdone. Even my vegetable-hating friend liked it. Next time we go, I'm going to try and get him to try the grilled artichokes...they looked fabulous!  For dessert, we tried the key lime pie. Wow. Sugar shock. Glad we decided to share a piece. Our server told us it is not usually so sweet...but it does vary since they make it in-house everyday.  Bluewater definitely attracts an older, quieter, more reserved kind of crowd. And my friend, who had just come from the Phoenix Open wearing golf attire, said he felt a little underdressed...wished he had worn slacks and a nicer collared shirt.",

WONDERFUL!), server was uninterested/uninteresting (service itself was good. Prompt.), nothing to write home about.  It's a more expensive, less tasty Red Lobster.

    "text": "Not great.  No, maybe moderately bad.  I just moved my office to the 16th Street Corridor or Squaw Peak Corridor (or Piestawa Peak Corridor, if you are new to PHX), and for the most part the food in the area is great.  Bluewater is not worth a second chance with so many good options.  I went for lunch, perhaps not Bluewater's strong suit.  I was alone and sat up at the bar immediately in the front door.  Realizing that I had sat at the Oyster Bar, I wanted to ask the Chef-Dressed gentleman behind the counter if I could order regular (non-oyster) lunch.  I waited patiently until the Chef-Guy and a customer finished their conversation about '80s Japanese sports cars (a minute or more to be acknowledged) which I did not mind because, heck, I like cars, so I could ask my question.  I was told \"I could get anything I want.\"  I love that statement.  Maybe I want a vineyard, but it's probably not on the list of specials.  I was handed a paper menu that already had a half a dozen mayo stains on it.  I hope it was mayo.  To my surprise, the lunch fare included 10 or so dishes ranging from $10 to $15.  I was surprised because I thought it would be cheaper judging from how Bluewater did no remodeling save the signs and flags from when The Fish Company served mediocre fare here.  I blew the bank on the $15 Crab Club.  I asked Chef-Guy what was on it, and he not so appetizingly said bacon, avocado, mayo (the last guy must have got it too) tomatoes and yes, crab.  Simple, right?  I went for it and got a Manhattan (red) clam chowder and coleslaw.  I received a large amount of free bread for one person without asking.  I didn't want it.  I got a sandwich after all, and I'm not carb-loading for today's workout.  Around this time, a nice older woman from Hawaii, she told me, sat next to me and she ordered ice tea.  She didn't get it.  She told Chef-Guy that she did not want bread.  She got it anyways.  She ordered a glass of wine.  She did not get that.  Another chap at the bar proclaimed , \"He always does that.  He gets so distracted.\"  Seven people are at the bar...  Chowder arrives.  It's ok.  It's my fault.  I don't think I have ever had memorable Manhattan Chowder.  If you are from New England and want to tell me how Phoenix food is horrible and how the only good chowder is back east, i.e: bagels, pizza, deli, etc., save your fingers.  I just don't care.  Go back east and take your pushy Trader Joe's Behavior with you.  Sandwich arrives much later.  I didn't mind. The British Open was on the TV.  The poor crab was getting a second chance at swimming.  The mayo sauce was running out on to the plate.  The chef should be fined for making a 600 calorie meal into a 1200 calorie meal.  I could not for the life of me taste crab.  I could have ordered Styrofoam Club, I would not have known the difference.  Coleslaw sucked.     I paid my $21 lunch with water tab and bounced.  On the good side, it was relatively clean, there was no real fish smell and I didn't get in an accident in the parking lot.  Back in the office now, the displeasure continues in my abdomen.            UPDATE        Jeff, the GM, contacted me via email and said that he discussed the review with staff.  He invited me back for another try.  That's pretty solid.  We'll see.",

We sat at the bar yesterday for my Dad's 60th Birthday dinner. We had the pleasure to have Ben as our server and bartender. Ordered fried calamari, fish tacos, bluewater sushi roll, yellow tail roll, spicy tuna roll, and a dozen oysters along with some Moscow mules. The food is always outstanding but this time we had to leave a review for Ben. I'd give him 10 stars if I could for his service and his great attitude. What a pleasurable experience. Always asked if everything was ok, never left us hanging with drinks, and his knowledge on the food in his restaurant was amazing. Food can be great at some establishments, but the service and smile goes a long way. Thank you Ben for your great attitude and exceptional service. We will be back during his shifts :)",

Lobster cooked perfectly except for a few raw spots.  Clam chowder heads and tails above any other.  Great cheddar potato",

My entree arrived fresh from the kitchen with a roach crawling on it. The worst part about it is we weren't convinced that roaches was a new problem for the manager. She apologized to us, then asked, \"well it must have been on the bottom of the plate, right?\" 1. Why does that matter? 2. That hardly seems like the first thought to come to mind if you just found out there was a cockroach in your restaurant's kitchen and on your guest's meal.  Safe to say we immediately left after speaking to the manager and went to have dinner elsewhere.",

Hubby chose ciopinno which is not always found on the menu even it fish restaurants. He was very pleased with his dinner. As an appetizer we had mushrooms stuffed with spicy tuna from the sushi menu. They were amazing and I highly recommend them.",

We order wine and he is attentive. The seafood soup is excellent . We order prawns and they're delicious. There are two sauces and we each ate two...they come 5 to an order but we requested an extra. We get oysters that are fried and Battered and I really enjoyed them. I am not a raw oyster fan. If you crave seafood in this land bound city, I highly recommend this place.

    "text": "Tried the yelp reservation app and it work great including the staff actually reading the instructions so thumbs up to the staff and yelp for that since it allowed a very nice birthday celebration without me trying to make those arrangements after getting there.   This was our first time here and we wanted to try everything.  Finally we settled on the halibut and the red snapper.    Before that we had soup and salad.  The New England clam chowder (the waitress actually tried to convince me of the Manhattan... nope!) was so good that my foodie 11 year old actually ordered a bowl after tasting mine and she has never been a chowder girl.  It was just great, think, full of clams and very flavorful... and absolutely no grit.    Next the seared halibut was delicious.  A generous portion (7-8oz) over a couple of goat cheese polenta wedges and seared greens.  I could have used more aioli sauce.  It was really flavorful.   I can see why this place has received \"Best Seafood in the Valley\" as we are seafood people and used to the abundance of seafood on the east coast as well as in Chicago believe it or not.   The snapper was not quite as good.  We are used to Atlantic red snapper and this was California snapper.  Not sure if it make a big difference but the taste just did not resonate as much.  The Sauteed Summer Squash and Kale as well as the seared spinach were tasty sides so that makes at leas three fantastic sides.  It seemed the snapper was seared and possibly even lightly breaded but it wasn't committed in my opinion.  I would rather have fried, seared or escoviche but what we got was sort of okay and okay means a two to three stars.  Everything else including the chowder and halibut, deserts and service were fives.  We will be back!",

Now its been five years and we make the trip out at least once a month. We've been to just about every seafood spot this town has to offer, minus the more suspect spots and we just can't find the level of service and quality of food you'll find at the Bluewater. Sit at the oyster bar, chat with the chef and order some oysters and steamed mussels prepped right in front of you. Great for date nights and best part is the prices are reasonable. We've only ever had one item we didn't enjoy a couple years back and a manager came over and took care of us right away. Highly recommend this seafood place over any other in Arizona. I've worked at some nice resorts and these guys know what they're doing.",

My husband says regularly that I throw around compliments like man hole covers-so with that in mind when I yelp I take food and service into consideration.  This is the third time this week we've been here to eat... Tonight was different, tonight we had to sit and listen to waiters discuss amongst themselves their Austrian heritage- their bloodline- and their Irish descent which quite frankly I don't care about.   What I do care about is their sushi which Ive  never ordered before.  I asked the server (the rudest and slowest one we've ever had) whether the rainbow roll was made with \"real crab\" as indicated in the menu. She asked the sushi chef and I was told it was.  When it was served it was obviously NOT real crab.  When I complained it was taken away and replaced with an order made with real crab.  Then the unpleasant female server along with a ponytailed white/grey haired male employee proceeded to talk loudly at the resister beside us and the fact we returned the \"FAKE\" crab in the rainbow roll. Yes we will return, but we suggest when ordering sushi that's advertised with real crab that you check it, because their fake was a pretty good imitation.",

It's was nice to be able to go out to eat with my fur baby since alot of places don't allow animals. But Bluewater grill is definitely the place to go on a nice date or if you wanna bring your four legged friends!",

    "text": "I don't give out 5 stars too often, but when I do, you bet it's well deserved!   SERVICE: Our server's name was Kat, or Cat, I can't remember but she said its Cat \"like meow\".  First, I could go on and on about how GREAT her service was. It was mine, my sister-in-law's, and our friend Mary's first time there, and we had now idea where to start, it was such a large menu. They are a seafood/steakhouse but there were SO MANY combinations. She made recommendations for us based on what we were looking for and we all left so satisfied. Mary and I had the Fire Grilled Mahi Mahi with Risotto and Arugula Salad, Kat recommended we add the Cajun flavoring, and I think that made it all the better. My sister-in-law had the Miso Glazed Swordfish and I had a taste of it as well, it was OH SO BUTTERY! We also had fried calamari as an appetizer, and creme brulee, also recommended by Kat as a dessert, and very much recommended by me now. As busy as it was, she was on top of things and oh so friendly. Best waitress I've had, EVER.   PRICING: $$$  Pricey, but worth it. I could see myself coming here, maybe every few months, maybe for an occasion or a special date night. For the 3 dishes we ordered on spot, 1 to go, fried calamari, and the vanilla bean blackberry creme brulee our total came out to $147 before tip. Each plate came out to about, $25-$30 each.   ATMOSPHERE: We ate outside on the patio and it felt like it was something straight out of a Nicholas Sparks Movie, fairy light strings, soft music, wood deck, and lots of greenery.   OVERALL: I'd take Nicholas Sparks on a hot date here if I were 20 years older. Only kidding, but you get the point!",

    "text": "Hubby and I just LOVE Lobster Rolls so when we heard that this place was having a special of a Lobster Roll and a cup of Clam Chowder for $20 we just knew we had to check it out! We arrived about 7:00 or so and was seated at a high top in the bar area. Our waiter came right over with a couple of waters and said he would be back to see if we wanted any other drinks. After a while we began to wonder if he was going to reappear when we noticed that he was actually the bartender. So that explained why he hadn't come right back. We waited awhile longer and eventually he came and got our order for a couple of iced teas and the Baked Clams Casino for an appetizer. Neither of us had ever had Baked Clams Casino style so I was anxious to try them. When they arrived there were six on the plate and they were piping hot and looked delicious with little pieces of crispy bacon sprinkled on them! I had to wait a little bit for them to cool down but once they did - man, they were good! I felt that the ratio of clam to bacon to breadcrumbs was spot on. However Hubby felt that the bacon overpowered the taste a bit. On a couple of them I did taste a little grit but not enough to stop eating them! We were almost done with them when we realized that the waiter (bartender) had not returned to take our food order yet. Luckily he came over right as we were going to get up and walk over there and he took our orders. We both opted to go with the special of a Lobster Roll with a cup of Clam Chowder. He asked us what side we wanted with them and after hearing our choices we both decided on the Red Quinoa Salad. Our cup of soups were brought over quickly by him but then we realized that he had not given us any crackers. We waited for him to return but after a while we decided to ask a busboy that was clearing a table next to us. He said he would go get some for us but never returned with any. Finally our waiter came back around to see how things were tasting and we told him that we were waiting on crackers for the soup. He apologized and quickly brought some. The soup was okay - not bad but not spectacular. Our Lobster Rolls arrived and we were both excited to dig in. The Lobster Rolls were pretty good - plenty of meat, not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and a crunchy, buttered bun just as I like them.  The temperature of the meat seemed off a little bit however. I prefer my lobster roll meat a little more on the chilled side (when made with mayonnaise) and this was room temperature. Also Hubby did find a little shell in his and commented that it appeared as if all the meat wasn't from the same lobster as some pieces were cooked better than other pieces.  The Red Quinoa Salad on the other hand was horrid! It had sounded like it would be a sweet and crunchy salad with red beets and almonds but whatever it was tasted just awful. Both of us took just one bite and looked at each other perplexed.  We couldn't believe that this is what it was supposed to taste like!  We were getting full by this time however and so we decided to just let it go. So all in all the meal was pretty good (except for that atrocious Quinoa!) but service was subpar.  It seemed as if we were there a lot longer than what was needed due to always waiting on our waiter/bartender and when he finally did clear the table and saw our untouched sides he never even inquired about them.  Oh well!",

We ordered popular staples and everything was very good - a shrimp cocktail with plump prawns and a zesty house cocktail sauce, lobster with the requisite butter dip, fisherman's platter featuring batter-fried scallops, shrimp, and fish. For dessert, we had a decadent creme brulee and an amazing flourless chocolate cake. Our vivacious server did a great job helping us make our choices by providing suggestions and detailed descriptions of various items. And seeing the tempting dishes the other servers were bringing to the other tables made me decide to do a return visit in the near future.",

It arrived looking like a very small portion with bland, boring sides accompanying the fish. I ordered the cioppino which they made white without the red sauce at my request. Again, average. Tasty sourdough bread served complimentary with meal. The New England calm chowder was was supposedly award winning but I also found it to be average. I know what good seafood is, and while this is markedly better than something like Red Lobster..... it is not anything to write home about. Our waiter was friendly but inattentive. He checked on us once at the very end of our meal. Our bill was over $100 for 2 people. Glad I went, probably won't be back.",

    "text": "We've been looking for a great seafood restaurant for several years in the Phoenix area. We found it!  The fish was fresh and perfectly done.  Nothing ruins good fish than even the slightest over cooking, they get it perfect at Bluewater Grill!  The New England clam chowder was great, large chunks of tender clams in a not too thick or thin cream base.  We had blue point oysters and grilled Spanish octopus for appetizers, both were wonderful. I had blackened redfish and my husband had blackened swordfish served on a bed of dirty rice, topped with a corn and avocado salsa. The menu had several specials and a wide assortment of fabulous choices. We'll have to go back often to try them all. Nicole, our server was very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. We enjoyed her.  The atmosphere is perfect, along with the paintings on the wall!",

We had calamari to start which was delicious and a very large portion as well. The swordfish steak was amazing! My dad recommended it and I'm so happy I tried it for the first time here. Definitely a must try. Had a great birthday experience here with my family and would definitely return back in the future :)   (Btw they also offer free soup for military veterans as well)",

It is in desperate need of remodeling, don't even get me started with the disgusting bathroom. This place is more divey than high end. The Maine lobster roll was awful. The shrimp cocktail needed horseradish, it had no kick. Everything else was mediocre at best and I would never return. They get three stars for the service and selection, if quality seafood is what your looking for go to Mastro's Ocean Club.",

The food is always good, but the happy hour menu for food is amazing!  Wouldn't drive across the valley for it, but it is definitely worth going to.  There was a bartender / oyster shucker who had a real weird attitude that always just made me feel, unwelcome?  Because of that I didn't come here for a year or maybe more...   But went with the wife and kids the other day for their happy hour, and weirdo wasn't there!  Our waiter was so accommodating with the kids, and just an absolute joy.  The food was great.

Medium to light flavor but a great deal for the happy hour price. Great option of chowder tasting. Try the clam chowder because it's delicious! I preferred the original over red clam chowder which has a hint of tomato. Sushi was made in front of us and the service was a 5/5. Not much of a bruschetta fan but the bruschetta there is well seasoned and the bread had a light crisp bite. Fitting place for a company event, couples happy hour, or large family party!",

We ordered the clam chowder as an appetizer and requested a bread bowl.  The bread bowl did not arrive until after we had finished our soup.  I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop skewers with cheddar mashed potatoes and zucchini and kale.  My shrimp was bland, and the mashed potatoes had no flavor.  The zucchini was cold, I was unable to eat both the mashed potatoes and zucchini.    My husband ordered the swordfish with polenta and zucchini.  The swordfish looked frozen and had absolutely no flavor, his zucchini was also inedible as it was cold.  The only thing he didn't mind was the polenta.  Our bill came to almost $90.  It was certainly not worth the cost, the experience lacked attention to detail, and the food was very bland and even cold.    If this was my first time, I would never go back.  I am sincerely hoping it was an off night, as we used to love coming here for date night.    Saddened that a place we used to enjoy so much had become mediocre at the very best.",

    "text": "As a vegan, this is not a restaurant I would choose for myself. Well, of course not - it's a seafood restaurant, after all. However, sometimes we vegans attend dinners in honor of others and someone else is in charge of choosing the restaurant. Sometimes that works out fine, but other times, not so much. The dinner last night honoring a colleague who is retiring falls in the latter category.  The only thing I found on the menu that was vegan was a salad with roasted veggies. That might not have been so bad if they had used dark leafy greens as the base instead of iceberg lettuce. I mean, come on - iceberg lettuce??? Who does that?! Also, the only other veggies they put in the salad were roasted red peppers, asparagus, and avocado. That's a good start, but please consider that this was the only \"meal\" they offered for vegans!  They couldn't see fit to throw in a few more veggies? Really? To try to make it a bit more palatable, I had to dump a bunch of salt and pepper all over it - which I had to ask for, because they didn't even have salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  The bill for my dinner - which consisted of just this sad salad - was $14.06 ($12.95 for the salad + $1.11 tax).    More and more people are going plant-based these days, and restaurants would do well to sit up and take notice. Unfortunately, as the rest of the world awakens, this restaurant remains fast asleep. Best to just tip-toe on past this one.",

We sat at bar where cook prepares appetizer dishes, he recommended his honey badger drink, I never heard of it but tried it any way, ended up having 2. Over all as far as the section we sat in, we enjoyed our meal and drinks and had a good over all experience.",

    "text": "I wrote a pretty tough review on March 27.  Since then I have been nothing but impressed.  First you should know that I run an internet marketing company so when I see a business using the internet to interact with their customers, I get pretty exited.  Within hours of me posting my negative review, Larry Macias Managing Partner of Bluewater Grill responded.  He invited me to call him on his cell or at the restaurant - which I did.  He apologized for the bad experience and invited me back as his guest.  I accepted the offer to return but did not want any free meals.  (My previous review was really a knock on the staff, not on the atmosphere or food.)  Long story short, we decided to try it again, but on a big scale. We invited 24 people to my wife's birthday party.  Larry took care of everything and I can now say we are fans of Bluewater Grill.  Our guests had an outstanding experience.  The food was excellent.  The staff was very attentive and professional. And the night became a memorable one.  So kudos to Larry and the Bluewater Grill, for reaching out to us, turning a bad experience into a positive one and demonstrating how interacting with your customers online can turn into a great use of the business owners time.  Remember, he got me to bring 24 people back to his restaurant!",

I am convinced they have the best sourdough bread in the Valley. Their happy hour menu offers drink and sushi discounts, and other favorites like sliders (burger or calamari), salt n pepper shrimp, calamari, cheesy garlic bread...all priced fairly. They have more stuff on the happy hour menu, I can't recall everything.   My last visit I had a Stella Artois, the Oysters Rockefeller (not on the happy hour menu but my favorite here) and an order of Garlic Fries (off the happy hour menu). The fries were just as good as some of my favorites from Gordon Biersch, crisp garlic goodness. The Oysters Rockefeller (4 to an order) filled nicely with creamy spinach and topped with cheese...and served with sauteed spinach. Mmmmm....  I find myself continually going back. Mostly during happy hour of course, and sitting at the bar. Enjoying each time I go.",

Our waitress, who also happen to be the bar tender, was extremely nice and friendly.   Their dark and stormy and moscow mule was tasty and refreshing.  We ordered oyster on half shell and decided next time it can be skipped.  Their $5 fish taco was totally worth the buck.  Ahi slider was way too small for the price even as a slider. The fries on the side was prefect though. (I am a fries addict.) It was fried with great temperature, crispy and not greasy. Flavor was just right and not too salty.  My friend and I disagreed on the calamari. I think their batter for the calamari was perfect. It was crispy (not the scrapping your mouth kind) yet soft  with perfect flavoring. He thinks the calamari is missing a little texture.   Will go back for some more for sure!!!",

    "text": "Another Smart Shopper deal opportunity to try Bluewater Grill. The deal was for $5.00 California roll, Spicy tuna, Philadelphia, the Caterpillar and Bluewater roll. Normally, it would be $7.95 up to $14.  As I looked around, I recall the memories of having lunch/dinner here when it was the The Fish Market.  I thought the place was larger before. Anyhow, going back to food, sushi was just ok.  Their famous roll was the Bluewater roll, normally $14, definitely not worth it.   If it wasn't for the $5.00 Smart Shopper deal, I don't think I would order any of the rolls at regular price.  This is certainly not a place for sushi lovers.   However, I do like the normal HH cook foods.  The cheesy garlic bread was delicious.  It was very cheesy!  Calamari Fritti with Cocktail Sauce was crunchy and tasty.  I find it interesting that their website HH menu has the Burger Slider with Fries & Melted Gruyere & Blue Cheese for $3.00, but on their HH menu at the restaurant it's $4.00.  Keep this mind when you order.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbluewatergrill.com%2Fmenus%2Findex%2Farticles40.htm&s=ff4e63355eb6290b8bd2d2949764a562643837f51af604e3cc62007b0706f629\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bluewatergrill.com/menus...</a> Service was good when it wasn't too busy.",

I ordered the blackened sea bass and then the waiter came back and said they ran out. So, I changed my order to the Ahi tuna. I ordered it rare but it was a bit overcooked.  The vegetable that came with it was a broccoli/cauliflower mix. I ordered the red potatoes, which I thought were going to be red new potatoes....but they were basically small steak fries.  The ahi tuna was the biggest disappointment. It had a bad taste. It wasn't cooked with any type of seasoning and it tasted a bit metallic. I shared some with my family just to let them see how bad it was. My fiance had rainbow trout and his was overcooked but at least it looked like it was seasoned with something! Mine was just a patty of white blah!  My son had fish and chips. He complained that it was dry so I tasted it and it was!! It did not have a good taste at all. It was probably the breading that gave it a bad taste. And then the fish itself was dry.  Oh, I forgot about the two good things:  1.) The clam chowder was great. 2.) I got a $1 drink coupon for checking in with Yelp.  Again, I won't rush back to this place; but if I ever find myself here, I'm sticking strictly to the clam chowder!",

The dining area of Bluewater is perfect for a mid-range seafood restaurant.  It's clean, the fresh fish display is a nice touch and the bar area is well put together.  This place definitely doesn't have the faint scent of despair and broken dreams that always seems to be present at Red Lobster.  The staff was attentive and polite.  Our server had a great grasp of the menu and was able to answer any questions we had.  Food was delivered at the perfect pace, with nothing feeling rushed.  I bet that the appetizers here really shine.  I got the Prawn cocktail, which was very tasty.  The prawns were fresh and the cocktail sauce had just a hint of kick to it.  For an entree I got Ahi Tuna, nice and rare.  The fish was tasty, though the tuna steak was much thinner than I'm used to.  I enjoyed the sides as well.  Sauteed spinach doesn't get much better than this.  My only gripe, and it's a minor one, are the prices.  The food was good, but it just didn't feel... right to pay as much as I did.  It was good, but it didn't seem to be THAT good.  Maybe it's just me, but there seemed to be a slight disconnect between the price and the product.  I will definitely give Bluewater another shot, most likely during either happy hour or for the clambake.",

I have eaten in the main restaurant and found it to be fine, but not a place I would pick as one of  my favorites.  The sushi is different, though.  We always order off of the Happy Hour Menu and it's all delicious.  They have the typical type of rolls, but also types I have never heard of that have more complex ingredients and flavors.  I highly recommend it.  The Happy Hour prices for food are not as low as I would like, but the sushi rolls are much larger than other places, so don't order many or you will be taking them home.  Happy Hour drink prices are good.  The service was excellent.  We basically had two waiters and the sushi chef stopped by to see if we had enjoyed our meal.  Even if you have been unhappy in the regular dining room, try going for sushi.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!",

We were excited to try it because there are so few quality seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area. The atmosphere was friendly and the service was excellent.  We found a good red wine from the well priced and (white-heavy) wine list.   We started with sushi as an appetizer and it was fresh and tasty. We sampled some sushi rolls and nigiri for the table to share. When we got to the main course, part of the table ordered grilled fish (salmon and swordfish) and the other folks ordered cioppino (seafood stew over pasta). The ciopinno was absolutely amazing. I could not stop eating it. The portion was enormous, so we took it home for lunch the next day and it kept well.  In looking over the menu, I think there would be something for everyone, and the fish choices were fantastic. We would definitely recommend that people try it out, especially if you are craving seafood.  We noticed that a few tables had kids, so we know that it is kid-friendly. Also, if you get a chance to check out The Upstairs on a Thursday night, it has the coolest after hours vibe you could want in the area. Live music, specialty drinks and a really really chill atmosphere.",

Most recently, as Bluewater Grill, the seafood is plentiful, fresh, fairly priced for inland restaurants offering such fair. I especially like to eat at the oyster bar where warm sourdough bread is served with your meal. Recently, a colleague and I ate oysters before fresh glazed salmon, perfect mahi mahi, cold beer, and good company. We were able to watch a ball game while dining and chatting with the server and bartender. Inside the restaurant is a wonderful sushi bar that is the rave of PHX. The ambiance is getting a little old but still has charm like an old seaside fish restaurant. A little updating will be needed soon. But the food is great, the fish fresh that day, and the prices modestly expensive but worth it. I plan to eat here every time I am in town.",

I've eaten many times in the regular dining area and its always good However, the sushi bar warrants special attention because it's often overlooked. We come here because the sushi is absolutely the freshest in town. The salmon melts in your mouth and the tuna has never had that weird \"metallic\" fishy taste that I've experienced at other, well-known sushi spots. The food here certainly is not cheap, but I think that there is real value knowing that you are getting fresh fish that is priced comparably or lower than most of the other sushi joints around town.",

Came on a Thur about 1/2 an hour before closing. Had 2 drinks downstairs before the back opened @ 10. Don't order hard alcohol downstairs. Whomever was making drinks skimps on the liquor. They have beer on tap downstairs but was told there are bottles upstairs. They do bring you a glass for your beer.  Everyone that works there we talked to was extremely friendly & attentive! Managers actually shook my hand & asked my name.  Ok, so upstairs... The Lounge has become one of my fave places in the valley. The decor is SOOO mellow. There are tables & chairs, couches, or the bar of course. They keep the lights down LOW with tons of white candles lit all over. It's very intimate. There's an outdoor patio w/ glass tables & big chairs for smokers. Was told they're debating putting porch swings in the indoor patio area. Right now there are tables & chairs & lots of candles along the windows.  The drinks were finally stiff & very tasty! A lot of people order Moscow Mules. They do have a full bar. There were 2 cute bartenders & 1 pretty waitress. Again, they weren't very busy. Maybe 40-45 people at the busiest.  There's LIVE music. We were listening to a guy sing & a girl play the cello. Before the live music the bartender had some great music playing. I recognized Tegan & Sara, Metric, etc... My only complaint is the music was too loud. It didn't jive with the setting. 1 of the bartenders kept messing with the volume & you could tell they've previously blown out the speakers already. I shouldn't have to yell to be heard.  I was told there was a unisex bathroom & instantly cringed. My concern was unfounded though. The bathroom was perfectly fine throughout the night. It's actually very nice. Turn the lock & it'll tell others it's \"occupied\". The door is HEAVY though. Shove on it.  So, how do you get to the Speak Easy? Pull around to the back. There'll be an unmarked door on the left. It's up a few stairs. There might be a guy working there who stands in front of the door. I hear he's the 1 that cards (I wouldn't know. Came up through the downstairs since my friend knew someone working there). You'll walk into a kitchen. There are stairs to the right or an elevator to the left. Stairs are fine for when you arrive, but they're a little dark. Be careful! If you've been drinking, take the elevator when you leave. Trust me!",

If you know your seafood, especially your ocean seafood, you will love the atmosphere and selection they offer. The scallops appetizer and grilled artichoke starters were great. I had the seasonal Alaskan Halibut that was grilled perfectly and every bit including sides and sourdough bread they serve was great. If your an ocean fisherman, this place will have you feeling right at home with the decor and fish mounts that made me think I was anywhere but in the Sonoran Desert. What a great meal and escape from the usual and the service was great too. Prices  were not over the top either and I can't wait to hit this place again soon.",

    "text": "Yes, Virginia, there is a decent seafood house in Arizona. In the seven+ years we've lived in Arizona, Bluewater Grill has been our favorite destination for good fish.   It has the feel of an east coast fish house, with wood floors, a weathered deck leading to the entry, and even a small fish market just inside the front door. Keep going. Either head to the sushi bar or the dining room, where you'll find at least a dozen fresh fish options. On our most recent visit, we chose from: Halibut Mahi Barramundi Sand dabs Walleye Trout Rockfish Scallops Shrimp King salmon Ahi tuna Snapper Cioppino bursting with shellfish of every type  Not to mention there are burgers, a steak and chicken for those who can't tolerate good seafood.   Every piece of fish I've devoured here has been perfectly cooked, a generous portion, and accompanied by two sides. Try the cheddar mash or polenta, or just about anything green. At my last visit, the Brussels sprouts were a tiny bit rare and hard, but my walleye was so light and perfect, I was not about to whine.   Dinners are served with sourdough bread and butter. Salads and soups are available at an extra cost. The chowders are especially good. They offer both Manhattan and New England chowders...and both are superb, loaded with fresh clams and veggies. I have often dreamed of having one for a starter and the other as my main entree. Yeah, that good.   Coming from the east coast, where Legal Seafoods claimed to have the best clam chowder, I can safely say this is better. Don't believe me? Ask for a sample.   Service is always warm and friendly. The manager is always on site and is actively involved in making things run smoothly.   Bluewater Grill has a full bar with creative cocktails, and they offer a small selection of desserts. I tend to go for the key lime pie. It's tart while still perfectly indulgent.   Dinner prices start in the high teens, with most in the mid $20 range. For fresh fish, this is perfectly reasonable. Sure, there are a few high end steak and seafood houses in Phoenix that might offer more options, but at double the price.   I'd much rather dine here and spend the extra on chowder.",

The raw bar was filled, so we grabbed some seats at the Sushi Bar.  We took advantage of the Happy Hour menu/beer options and started with a large Sapporo while perusing the menu. My dining partner opted to order the Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna HH Nigiri and the Spicy Tuna Roll. We also shared a dozen Blue Points for $20 (great deal). I ordered the Steam Clams and also a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder.  The Oysters were excellent, very fresh, they came with 2 Sauces and freshly grated Horseradish. The Steam Clams in the broth were also excellent along with the bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder chock-full of veggies and clams. We did find that the sushi was disappointing. Fish was OK, way too much rice. The Spicy Tuna Roll, though huge was OK. I know that next time we come we will stick with the non sushi menu.  Great Happy Hour Deals, will be back again, but not for the Sushi.",

The location is great as well as the food coming out of the kitchen.  The Service is the only reason I give the Bluewater Grill a 4 star.  You can see that they really try to provide great service but not much of a team effort.    I always say that if you walk by a table and you have nothing in hand go ahead and help buss tables.  Your walking to the back of the house anyways why not take some dirty dishes with you.    Definitely one of my local favorites.  I do feel comfortable enough that if it's not right then get the Manager involved and they do seem to care from my own personal experience.",

We ordered a Cesar salad and grilled octopus to start. My dinner companion felt the salad was flat, but my octopus was grilled perfectly with delicious accompaniment of mini potatoes and a tangy remoulade. Entrees were fresh and tender King crab legs and a delightfully spicy sushi crab roll, followed by a yummy Java mud pie that we inhaled. This is a definite be- back !",

    "text": "We ate lunch here yesterday, after I had a doctor's appointment in Phoenix. We aren't from the area, and had a few hours worth of road travel to get here.   I chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews, and by the \"best seafood in Phoenix\" award. I also wanted to try oysters for the first time. Bucket list item. Being that this is the desert, I wanted to make sure what I had was fresh! And with the claim of freshness, I thought this was a good choice.  Upon arriving at lunch time, the restaurant was not too busy for a weekday. Decor was decent. We were seated quickly. The waitress came to take our order and I told her it was our first time there. She asked for our drink order. I told her about the yelp well drink offer and brought up the offer on my phone. She looked at it and seemed annoyed. I ordered a mojito and was curtly told that would not count as a well drink. In house beer, wine, basic only. We chose another drink and ordered our other drinks, as well. The waitress left.  We then received our bread. I it was barely warm, stale (not crusty, stale) and the butter was solid. A bad mixture. We ate part of it and were disappointed with it.  The drinks arrived. The offered well drink was quite watered down and not good. Only drank about 1/2 of it.   We ordered our food. I explained that i wanted to try the oysters on the half shell for the first time and was nervous, and what to expect. I asked what choices there were. She told me of two choices. I asked the difference and she told me the difference between the two. I ordered the blue point, a lobster roll with cole slaw and a bowl of chowder.  My other guest ordered chowder, and we split our food.  The chowder was decent. I have had much better. A lot of sand in the clams which was unpleasant and not good for the teeth. I should have said something about it, as it bothered me a lot.  The oysters were fun to try and really good. I could tell they were fresh, and that pleased me. By far the best part of the meal. The lobster roll was ok. The lobster wasn't that fresh and a bit chewy. I have had a lot of lobster in my life, so I know how it should be when it is really good. The bread on the sandwich was a little over grilled. The cole slaw was ok but rather plain. We didn't eat much of it.  Overall a pretty big disappointment, other than the oysters. Service was sorely lacking for such few customers. The lunch came to over $50, which was definitely over priced.   Next time we are in town, I will choose a different restaurant as our food was not worth the cost and we weren't impressed with the service.",

I asked about the 'Strawberry Smash', and she said it was great. Unfortunately, the drink was very bland(my date agreed). I let it sit until after the calamari was served. At that time I did mention it to our server, and ordered a Bloody Mary which was so 'Smashing', my date ordered one, too! My first drink was compted by the manager. Shared the fried Calamari-very moist and tender, fried and seasoned perfectly. It was a generous serving that filled the plate. Asked our server what the two sauces served on the side were, and I think I caught her completely off guard...luckily, I still had the menu at the table. And was able to share with her what they were! The table next to us had already been served their entrees, and I happened to glance over and saw an amazing dish that one of the diners had. It was the Seared Scallops surrounding a bed of spinach with mushrooms-totally delicious! Since I am a transplant from Seattle, I really miss seafood that hits the mark. This place was busy, so obviously, the food is worth the money spent. Note: I did try to  order Oysters Rockefeller, but they were already out of oysters, and this was before 7pm! Be sure to ask what they are out of before ordering...  For my second visit, I will try Happy Hour and see how it compares!  Rita C.",

    "text": "You'd probably laugh if any Phoenician claimed to have eaten fresh seafood at a local restaurant in town.  And you'd be justified in doing so.  We're 6 hours from the nearest major body of water and the fish we catch in rivers and lakes here in AZ is outsourced or \"farmed\".  So let me put to rest any pretenses of fresh from the water seafood.  I can't make that claim about Bluewater, nor would I try.  But if you're looking for the closest equivalent in the Phoenix metro, this is probably it.  This place actually used to be known as The Fish Market back in the day before they remade it into a restaurant that also retains a seafood market.  There's actually three parts to this place.  There's the market area where you can shop for, weigh, and purchase seafood on display in back.  There's also an oyster bar where you can come by for a drink and have a freshly shucked oyster or two (pretty cool idea for happy hour).  And most prominently, there's the sit down restaurant that has the feel of a more upscale version of Chuy's.  I brought my Mom here for dinner.  She'd been here before, I hadn't.  The mark of a good seafood restaurant is always a good bowl of clam chowder so we started with that.  Good chowder.  Not the best I've had in my life, but probably among the best I've had in the Phoenix area.  For dinner I got the Cioppino with crab, mussels, shrimp,  scallops, and clams in marinara sauce.  The sauce was a little heavy, but the mix of seafood made for a rich broth that helped flavor all of the seafood.  I was stuffed to the gills after both dishes so I skipped dessert.  Prices for this place aren't cheap.  The chowder, cioppino, glass of anchor steam beer, tax, and tip came to about $50.  Pretty much all of the seafood entrees range from $20-$40.  I probably wouldn't eat dinner here very often other than for special occasions.  Though happy hour at the oyster bar would probably be something cool to try.  So bottom-line, if you're a fresh seafood snob and want it straight from the ocean, drive 6 hours west to the California coastline.  But if you're okay with the next best thing here in the desert, Bluewater will probably get the job done.",

Maybe tell us first? Asked for no bread or dairy on my salad...so it comes with cheese and toasted bread.  Good thing that came before 815pm, which is when dinner arrived. As usual, it was \"We are so busy\". Really? The bar was half empty after 645. We had no one around us. Maybe the wait staff just wasn't paying attention. I will not be back.

While the prices and portions are about the same as the Fish Market, the food was pretty decent!  The four of us shared a Baked Dungeness Crab & Artichoke Dip, a Mahi Mahi entree, a seafood [I forgot what it was but it had two types of seafood] ravioli entree, and two Homemade Creme Brulee!  Out of everything we had, I think the Baked Dungeness Crab & Artichoke Dip was the best.  The Mahi Mahi was a bit dry, the ravioli itself was a tad bland although the sauce was incredibly flavorful, and the creme brulee was amazing!  My boyfriend's sister actually works here.  Since she wasn't working, I couldn't get her to serve us but we had the most delightful waiter:  Joe!  He was very patient with us [four early-20 girls = not easy to handle] and was very amusing [Enunciate the \"Creeeeeeeeeeeme Brulee\"]!  A word of advice:  The entrees are a bit small so definitely stick with an entree each person!",

The restaurant is noisy, staff is awesome and it is as casual as you want to make it. flip flops and shorts works for both lunch and dinner. Fair prices for fresh seafood is always a plus. Just make sure you drive your small sports car and leave the SUV or Cadillac at home because parking spaces are really narrow and the lot is crowded!!",

The place itself is clean, smells good (not fishy) and lots of pics to look.   Waitress and welcome hostess were polite and pleasant. Really enjoyed our time here, I will recommend the tacos with extra green salsa and lemons. Wife ordered the shrimp sliders (not worth the price and nothing special) even tho they did have a nice taste to them. But still, not worth the cost. California roll was your basic taste just everywhere else, if you're a fan of sushi than don't get it.   Overall experience was good and will definitely comeback for more.",

This time we did ... and we are glad we did.  Large establishment with a variety of seating options. We opted for a booth on the edge of the bar area. Overall, service was good but a little slow on the uptake (slow with respect to menus, waters & drink orders / otherwise just fine). We shared everything and ended up ordering more than we needed .... but enjoyed what we could finished.  Our meal started with wine and sparkling water. For me a Cabernet, Stonestreet - Alexander Valley, CA and for my lady a Chardonnay, Trefethen, from Napa. We also started with a Blue Water Roll along with a Beet & Spinach Salad. The sushi consisted of seared ahi, tempura shrimp, krab mix and avocado which was pretty good in my opinion. My partner liked the beet salad which included oranges, pistachios, pickled fennel and smoked goat cheese.  I don't appreciate beets therefore my opinion does not count. We finished with Grilled Halibut and the Maryland Style Crab cakes. The Pan-seared halibut was served with a parmesan polenta cake, oyster mushrooms, spinach and oven dried tomato vinaigrette - truly marvelous.   This was a solid dining experience. Give this place a try",

This location was on my birthday, and it was not intended to be a fete' but a low key meal for two. Our server was wonderful, I regret forgetting her name but I forget everything nowadays. I did not forget to reflect her service in the gratuity so that is what counts.  I ordered the Ipswich clams because it is very difficult to find whole belly clams anywhere nowadays, even on the east coast at local fish market restaurants in my home town. They were cooked to perfection, not rubbery, sweet and definitely fresh. The side dishes were great and that is where Bluewater is head and shoulders above not only most seafood \"joints\" or fine restaurants, but most restaurants period. The selection is great, and innovative. My sauteed summer squash was an assortment of squashes, and instead of the usual bland squash coins or julienne, they were long somewhat thick almost kind of like squash dreadlocks, mixed with other veg, well seasoned and absolutely succulent and delicious. The Yukon gold mash with cheddar were also delish. My dining companion loved his Brussels sprouts and coleslaw, and stated his lobster was perfectly steamed. I also ordered the oysters Rockefeller as an appetizer, and they were also well prepared and delicious. A variation on the absolute traditional preparation, but delicious. Our meal was simple, but spot on.  I return on Tuesday for the paella and taste of Spain and will add to my review with an update.",

Our first visit we had the clam chowder (seriously the best!!), crab legs and mussels with chorizo. The soup and crab were good but I was underwhelmed by the mussels. The broth had very little flavor; if it wasn't for the chorizo, the dish would have been terrible. Our second visit we stuck to what we knew was good, and each had a cup of chowder and split the alaskan king crab legs. Worked out perfect.  The cons for me are the prices and atmosphere; mainly the fact that I don't think they match. This place is not a fine dining atmosphere, which I thought it might be based off of the menu and prices. When you walk in, the main room is a row of booths that literally make the place feel like Denny's or Ihop. Thankfully they do have a second room that is more charming and seems like part of an old house. We have been able to thankfully sit in that area both times. Although it is worth mentioning we were sat right next to the server station and a huge soda machine. Don't come hear looking for a romantic meal I guess is what Im trying to say.",

At a previous Yelp Event, I sampled some fare from Bluewater and was impressed, so this was my choice for BirthdayBashStop#1.  Bluewater features a raw oyster bar and a sushi bar. When you first enter, they have a fabulous display of their market lobsters, oysters, clams and a variety of fish. They looked very fresh.  The oyster bar is happening, with Chef Mark and Ben on shucking and cooking detail. Oyster featured was a Paradise Oyster from Southern Baynes Sound, British Columbia, the New England Blue Point Oyster and a large meaty oyster from Puget Sound. Dang it, I can't remember its name! Weekend Happy Hour was from 3:30-6:30 pm. Half dozen oysters for: $12 and a dozen for $20. Familiar with the delicious, Blue Points, I went for the Paradise oysters. The oysters Chef Mark served up were fat, creamy and pristine. These bad boys were accompanied with cocktail sauce, lemons, freshly grated horseradish and a vinegar and onion mix. I love mine with a dash of Tabasco, dollop of cocktail sauce, horseradish and squeeze of lemon. The shell was so pretty, longish shaped, with a slight curve. Slurping up the smooth morsel, perfectly shucked and drinking in the sea on a calm tropical day, a slightly saline sweet oyster liquor..... I was in heaven. I tried the vinegar mix, nice, but I am happy with eating all of mine with Tabasco and horseradish. Chef Mark washed my shells for me to take home.  The Yelp Check-in is draft beer or a cocktail for $1. I enjoyed an American Mule with a robust ginger beer!  Chef Mark brought us warm sourdough with real butter. Good stuff. It was the highlight for hubby!  After re-introducing hubby to quality oysters, we discussed what to eat next. We went with our the Clams Casino, well reviewed by fellow YES Squad members. We were not steered wrong. Cherry Stone Clams can sometimes have an acrid finish raw, so going for a cooked preparation was a great choice for us. Chef Ben took care of us. He served up large clams halved, dressed with cheese, breadcrumbs and thick sliced bacon bits, baked in a convention oven in front of our eyes. These beauties were presented on a bed of raw spinach. I enjoyed the smoky, cheesy baked goodness wrapped in my spinach. Chef Ben saw we enjoyed spinach and asked if we wanted to try some sauteed spinach. I have never enjoyed cooked spinach so much in my life. Spinach cooked in high heat, seasoned, then tossed with garlic and a splash of Balsamic vinegar. Magical! He then brought us another loaf of that sourdough and butter.  I loved my first experience at the Bluewater Grill. I felt at home at the oyster bar seated with regulars, bantering with our chefs, exchanging oyster stories, cooking techniques. I laughed and ate heartily. This was one of the best birthday meals I have had! Thank you, Mark, Ben and Bluewater Grill for my birthday treat! I will be back with more friends!",

It is very rare that you find that level of customer service nowadays!!   On our next visit, it was a completely different experience. Service was very helpful and attentive, thanks to Sean our waiter, and he also made a killer recommendation for the Mahi Mahi.  Our appetizers (scallops, crab cakes) were quite tasty. And then the Mahi Mahi! Wow! Came with a deliciously perfect risotto and the balsamic syrup made the entire dish. The flavors were amazing together and I can honestly say it's one of the best dishes I've had all year!  A big thanks to Jeff for taking care of us so professionally and getting us to come back. I am very glad we did and we will definitely be back again!!",

This time we were assigned a booth in the bar area due to lack of availability in the dining room, despite having had confirmed reservations. For 10 min we were not attended to at all, then four different waiters showed up including the bar tender asking if they could help us. This was a terrible service by a disorganized waitstaff, that obviously needs better training. The restaurant after all these years would benefit from a general remodelling. The food was still decent, but in combination with this terrible service not worth the price. This chain should be able to do better.",

For the entree, I had the current special of red fish, which was perfectly prepared and delivered rich Cajun flavor. I wasn't quite as impressed with the rice and beans that the fish was topped on, but eating vicariously through other plates in the room, it looks as though they have much better options available.   All in all, the food was great. Not quite a \"knock your socks off amazing\" good, but it's not just about the food. The service was exquisite and the ambience was very warming and made it the complete package that I would gladly recommend.",

I had the lunch Fisherman's Platter for $16.95. For a $16.95 lunch I was expecting more than 1 scallop, 2 shrimp, and 1 small piece of fish. I should have paid more attention to the menu, but again the description is a little vague too. It states Panko Prawns (not how many). Panko Scallop (notice no plural s at the end of scallop). Beer Battered Alaskan Cod (does not state you get 1 very small piece). Next time I crave seafood I will drive over to King's Fish House at Tempe Market Place. Prices are the same but the quality of seafood and fish is much better.",

We sat outside on the patio which was nice and quiet a bit more romantic as the inside is a bit more what you would expect in a upper end fish house. We had the crab cakes for an appetizers which were delicious more crab than we usually see and one entree was the scallops, which were amazing! We also had the Haddock which was okay. It was a seasonal fish that was just about out of season so I chose it but maybe should have started with what's most popular first as there wasn't a lot of flavor unfortunately, a little bland. We do plan to go back though and try one of the Chef Favorites. (FYI: The scallops were ; - )",

So to start we ordered the Crab Dip for our appetizer, it is very very good and they give you a pretty good portion, we ran out of dipping bread before we ran out of dip.   Now from the way it was described to me I thought the salads were included with our entree, but apparently it is a separate item. I didn't realize this till I got the check... I got the dinner salad almost $6... so not worth it, my gf got he Tuscan Caesar almost $8...not worth it...even thou these things are ginormous I could get a full salad bar somewhere for this price. The salads were good and big, but not worth the $14 I spent on them.   My gf ended up with the Mahi special and I went with the chicken special. These were both pretty well prepared. My gf thoroughly enjoyed her plate and we kept trying each others dishes. Both of these items together were over $40 They were good, but they didn't stick out as being great. Just kind of OK.   All in all this place is ok, the service was slow, I had to ask two different passing by servers for drink refills, and for more bread and I think its a bit overpriced. This place may have gotten 4 stars if the service would have been a bit better and the staff would have explained that the salads were additional and spent more time tending to us.    I have been to better places, I would be willing to give this place another shot.",

We placed a order to go for the seafood plater & it taste like it was frozen or cooked the day before. 2 shrimp 2 small pieces of cod & dry flavorless scallops. The french fries was the highlight of the platter. It was over priced. Not good. We also ordered The Lobster Roll & crab sandwich. The lobster roll was good but had more spongy lobster claw meat & not enough lobster tail meat. The crab sandwich was good & I love bacon but I wouldn't have it on that sandwich. The sides we had I only liked the Kayle & zucchini. The mashed potatoes had a dirt grit to them like the potatoes wasn't cleaned before cooking. The coleslaw was flavorless very bland. Not good. For 65$ & a 27min drive I will  not eat there again. I gave them 2 stars because the Lobster roll & crab sandwiches was just ok. And if made with a little more love & I dined in to have it made better they would have been AWESOME. If anyone has any other suggestions for FRESH seafood places in AZ please let me know.",

Waitress was knowledgable and friendly, though a little overbearing.  I ordered the tilapia ($15.95) and it was just fine.  It tasted a little muddy, but not nearly as bad as (for example) catfish I've had in the past, and it definitely was better than Olive Garden's.  I didn't try it with its sauce since I don't care for lemon (or capers).  The accompanying French fries were hot and crisp, and much better than the cold (not even lukewarm) cheddar mashed potatoes (hopefully those will be better as leftovers).  The manager was very pleasant, and I admire that he was out working on the floor.  Considering their high price point, I don't know if I'll be back.  Maybe for lunch one day?  Or if someone really wants to buy me crab or lobster?

Because of dietary restrictions, I struggle to find restaurants that can accommodate me, so finding one that accommodates me and is delicious is a real treat. Not only were my prawns and scallops wonderful, but the chef made sides (jasmine rice and garlic sauteed spinach) that were perfect. My husband greatly enjoyed his cioppino, and our friend (a local) had never been here before and was delighted with his meal and will come back. Our server (Chevy?) was very cheerful and attentive, and was very careful to be sure we were all pleased. One extra touch: we were trying to decide on a wine and she brought us samples of the ones she recommended for us to try. Her suggestions were great, but we all liked one very much, and were grateful for the tasting so that we had wine we all enjoyed,",

There are no dishes that I would eat so I guess I was forced to order the $34 lobster dinner. I might suggest one non fish item be added to the menu. Anyway I was happy with my meal. The whole Maine lobster was cracked and was very easy to remove from the shell, the meat was very sweet, I had the scalloped potato which was a huge portion, creamy and delicious and broccoli which was cooked just right. The service was excellent.  All in all this was a good experience. Good location, right off the 51. This restaurant is not cheap but worth the money.",

Is that because it's solid, but not shout out loud great?  Maybe so.  One disclaimer: on this trip I wasn't my usual starved self, which can make a big difference on how good food tastes..so you never know, it could have been a 4 if I was hungrier.   We got the oysters, which aren't my fav thing, but my lovely lady liked them a lot. A LOT. Next was some crab cakes which were pretty tasty I must say. The baked mussels were ok, but far from the best ehhh-va. A bit too garlicky for me. By now I'm getting pretty full, but  still had the Sunshine sushi roll beaming it's way into my future. It was not bad, but not great either. The taste was a bit bland but the texture was somehow an interesting mix of soft and crunchy.   Side note. This place plays GREAT MUSIC and does have decent decor.  Surprised how current and cool the music was with stuff from Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Gregory Alan Isokov among others.   Definitely worth checking out, but the jury is still out if it's worthy of being in the regular rotation.",

We visited from Northern AZ and I was stunned to find a place like this in the middle of this dessert!!! - Although we found the place fine with GPS, the sign was quite big but the access via the mall parking lot is kind of tricky. Also there was a very pungent odor of seafood in the lace, a bit overwhelming, but the ambiance was delightful and perfect for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary. We had the Maryland fresh catch of the day oyster platter and WOW!!! Not a fan of the Sushi we ordered, but I must say that the service was fast and friendly. We will definitely come back for the Oysters ;-)",

I did not venture back for quite some time but was enticed back because of their happy hour.  They have a fantastic happy hour filled with all kinds of great food including Sushi.  They make a Rainbow Roll that is fantastic.  It is indeed the largest rainbow roll that I have ever had.  Another great thing about their happy hour is that they offer it on the weekends from  noon to 5pm, 3:30 to 6:30 during the week.  If you are a clam chowder fan, you will like theirs.  Lots of clams and served with little oyster crackers.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive.",

The bartender at the front bar had the nerve to proposition my wife and sister while my brother and law and I went to the restroom.  When we got home we all have a terrible bout of food poisoning which lasted for 3 days.  So we were very disappointed with the Grill's food and its' no class bartender",

    "text": "Disappointing.    I've eaten here about 5 times over the last couple years.  This review is for the last two times, over the last 1 year.    First, service has been bad on both occasions.  Seems like they either have assigned twice as many tables to each waiter as they should, or the waiters just are rude, but I have experienced unacceptable waits for each stage of the dining on both occasions, with two separate servers, so there is a real problem.  With that said, servers were nice and professional when they were there... just took too long.  Second, atmosphere is just okay.  You're typical mid-market seafood joint.    Third, the food is just okay.  I mean it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars, depending on what you order.  Portions are on the smaller side.  I've tried the Mahi Mahi (crispy fried in olive oil on outside with what tasted like a Montreal Steak Seasoning), as well as their Scallops.  The scallops were by far the best.  The fresh sourdough bread is outstanding... I could eat several baskets if I let myself!  But for my fourth point, and the most important, the VALUE is NOT there.  It's too expensive for what you get.  I feel like every entree, if it was $3-4 cheaper, would be fair price.  Maybe.  But for just \"average to good\" food, it's not worth the prices.    I told myself after eating there last night I won't be back.  Perhaps I'll forget that pledge, but I hope not.  Go elsewhere (such as McCormick & Schmick's just up the road in Esplanade).",

You must spend at least $10 before you can apply that $10 credit to your bill.  Make sure you join their E-Crew mailing list.  I ordered Burger Slider because I want to find out how good their fries are, and I must say, the fries was very delicious.  It's very crispy and in big chunks.  Ketchup was the only sauce available to go with this dish; Next dish was the Fish Tacos.  It used to be $5 for two, now it's $6 for two, I think it's a big jump, but it was very tasty and good.  I don't mind paying for more, but I like the size to be a little bit bigger, I finished my taco in less than 3 bites each; Last dish was the fried calamari.  I lope the two special sauces, one of them was the Thai Chili sauce.  The texture of the calamari was improved, but the serving size is still not enough.  I washed everything down by ordering a Blue Moon draft, the glass was iced cold and the beer was refreshing.  My server was Kelly and her attitude was great and service was excellent.  It wasn't very busy as Happy Hour was just started before I got there.  If you want freshness and great service, you have to go to Bluewater Grill.  And make sure you sign-up for the mailing list for your $10 coupon on my birthday month.",

Pictures of the ocean and stuffed fish decorate the walls. There's a huge ship-in-a-bottle on display.   But when it comes to the food, like everybody else is saying, the portions are small for the price. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. The fish is dipped in hot spices but it's not terribly hot because the cabbage and avocado on top mellow it out. They were good but not worth the $13.50.   I picked couscous for the side. Their couscous is not what I expected. I'm spoiled by the cracked wheat/vegetables on top variety. Their couscous is composed of large pearl seeds topped with yellow peppers and sliced almonds. It was very bland. It'd be worth the price if you could pick two sides.  Our waiter, Roland, was really chill and personable. However, I can't recommend the Bluewater Grill.

Family owned and managed buy PEOPLE (not a large corporation or investment fund); Bluewater Grill is PASSIONATE about your food.   Bluewater knows where your food comes from, do you, do other restaurants know where their food comes from other than just a large freezer in some warehouse?   Jeff the Manager of Bluewater Grill knows where the food comes from, he and his owners know the people, boats and processes to deliver you a world class fishy experience.  Every possibility has been has been investigated and questioned to make sure the food that they serve to you has been thoroughly prepared with care, love and perfection.    I could go into the most succulent fresh natural tuna I have ever experienced & swordfish captured alive so that it doesn't end up fighting for its life stressed, tough and dry on your plate.  Yes people that is why your normal swordfish experiences ends up tough, dry and bitter.  This is not normal and you should avoid anywhere that serves a dry, tough and bitter swordfish.   Go somewhere where the staff and owners want you experience perfection.   However, I would expect you to do some research, read the rest of the reviews, reserve a table and experience seafood in a whole new wonderful taste explosion.    I have never been so intimate with my fish!   I have never had such a wonderful experience as you will when you are served by people who are passionate about bringing you the best seafood.  I am already planning 2 more trips this month. Don't forget this is not just a sit down restaurant, they provide take home service and a FRESH FISH MARKET STORE inside as well.    For larger parties they have 2 private areas downstairs or a huge 100 seater private function room upstairs complete with summer room with view of the mountains, open air balcony, bar and private kitchen for you and your guests to see how everything is prepared.",

Food, prices, and ambiance were a solid 4. We sat right next to the counter where the food was ready to be taken to the tables. Everything on the menu looked good and everything that actually came out of the kitchen looked great.  It's worth noting that my wife and I both came to the same conclusion over dinner that there was something odd about the place. Nothing crazy, but it hit us. There were some aspects that were upscale and some were casual. As we were sitting there eating and taking it in you really get the sense that it is a peculiar cross between an upscale and a casual restaurant. I've actually not experienced that before. Is it a nice restaurant striving to be upscale? Or an exceptional restaurant trying to be relaxed. It was an interesting vibe nonetheless.   Would definitely recommend. Food was great and that's not always the case for seafood in the middle of a desert. And if you can get Cliff, you certainly won't be disappointed.",

We enjoy the talented chef, Scooby aka Mark who works the raw bar at the front of the restaurant.  On our first visit we shared the Cioppino with a cream sauce that he customized for us starting with the best Oysters Rockefeller we ever had.  On our second visit, we split the special Baked stuffed Lobster served with a choice or red or white chowder, we opted for the white.  The special also included 2 sides & a glass of Pinot Grigio.  And once more we started with two appetizers, Oysters Rockefeller & the HH Spicy charred Edamame.  Service was excellent as was our dinner.  We will be back.",

It is really good and worth a try. Then I had the Duckett's bucket., which is a huge pail of probably 1t clams and 15 Mussels in a white wine Garlic sauce. Most places give you less seafood and charge more. I though it was definitely worth the $19 price. Dipping the sourdough bread in the broth was a transcendental experience. Service was very professional and friendly. My mom had the chicken under a brick, it was very herbaceous and moist. A good choice if you take a non fish lover in your party.  For sure going back to try other things on the menu.",

The waitress although nice, was too laid back. All she did was make excuses. Excuses for the SLOW SERVICE, time it took to get our dinners (1.5 hrs) and cold food. Some sides were not even brought out with dinners as they were making more. Cold when they did come out. Manager was no better. He should have compt all our dinners but did comp 2 glasses of wine snd 1 desert. Excuses, excuses, excuses!!! Ih, it was extremely busy tonight! Took 30 min to get a glass of wine, and another 30 to get salads, then another 30 to get cold food . First and LAST TIME there!!! Don't waste your money or time!! Not worth it!!! Also, I told the waitress at least 4 times to give us a separate check. Well, no surprise, she didn't do it and had to go back and revise it. What a LOSER of a restaurant!! Any manager would have had more than EXCUSES. I hope corporate reads this!!!",

Not only did their seafood look appetizing, but they had a happy hour as well!  Their happy hour is from Monday-Friday 3:30pm-6:30pm and Saturday-Sunday 12:00pm-5:00pm.   I ordered a dozen oysters and the Phoenix Roll. The oysters (from Maine) were some of the best I've ever had and I've had a lot. The oysters were huge and very fresh!   I always have hesitation when I have sushi that doesn't come from a sushi only establishment, but the sushi/fish here was very fresh! The plating was beautiful as well. The roll had krab mix and it was great since it didn't include a lot of mayo.   While there I already made a decision to come back when I'm back in town. This is a MUST!   Also, the staff here is very welcoming and friendly. Always a plus! Great food and staff.",

One member who had Fish and Chips was good. The shrimp were OK!  Side of mashed potatoes was paste.  Crab cakes were OK!    Overall portion sizes were small.  We did NOT feel the seafood was fresh. There was nothing exciting about our dining experience...  It has been a couple of years since dining at BWG, at that time it was excellent.. The above comment was already posted. In addition is a comment regarding the poor lobster tail. A warm water (Brazilian or whatever) is not a prime lobster. It is tough and stringy. It is better to have a cold water tail (priced higher) or don't have one at all and put a note if you don't carry lobster tail of the difference and the cost.",

Sushi is excellent. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I have eaten at the restaurant in Redondo Beach, CA so I knew it would be good here too. On our visit we started with the Spicy Tuna Tartare and I had the special of Alaskan Halibut and my husband had the Scallops. Both were made to perfection. Once seated, you get a warm basket of sourdough bread which is fantastic. We have eaten here several times for lunch so the sushi is amazing especially during happy hour, fish tacos and fish and chips are great too.  If you are looking for an authentic fish restaurant then Bluewater will not disappoint. It is sourced fish (meaning they catch it and tell you where is it sourced), scratch cooking all fresh no pre-packaged. The service is wonderful. We always make a reservation for a dinner seating but you can just walk in for lunch since you can eat at the bar area comfortably.",

    "text": "I'll be honest, folks, I'm more of a steak kind of gal. But the dude is real into seafood, so after months of talking about it, we decided to finally check out Bluewater prior to a comedy show downtown on a Saturday night.   We arrived before 6 and were surprised by how busy it was. The parking lot isn't huge and is fairly cramped, so be prepared to do a couple circles or trek just a little bit. We were told there was a little bit of a wait, but ended up just finding a table at the bar/lounge area which is all open seating and you can still eat a full meal there--always a plus in my book.   We started with a couple drinks (50% off your first one if you check in on yelp!); I had the Serrano margarita and he had a mule. His mule was great but a standard mule; hard to mess up. My margarita had pockets of extra spicy that made my mouth feel actually on fire, but then other sips were totally fine. I panicked while ordering and realistically should've gone with something else, but I think if you're normally a fan of spicy drinks, you'd be super into this one.   We also had a cup of the half and half chowder to start--Manhattan and New England. It was super yummy. I'm normally not a big fan of Manhattan style chowder, but it was awesome here and the two chowders together played very well. I had the San Francisco Cioppino for my meal, over linguine. A San Francisco native, I am obsessed with cioppino and am basically always searching for something to hit that spot; not expecting a ton out of a seafood restaurant in a landlocked state, I was very pleasantly surprised by this dish. It was so tasty with TONS of seafood. No skimping here! Big fat juicy pulls of crab meat, tons of clams/mussels/shrimp and a big ole scallop, everything was delicious and perfect. The marinara was tasty and flavorful without being overly salty, and went great with all of the seafood and noodles. The serving size was gigantic too! Well worth the price tag for sure. The guy had the grilled barramundi and polished it off in 7 minutes; not at all because it was skimpy on portions (definitely was a solid serving size), but because it was just THAT good. There were a lot of strong flavors in his dish, but they played perfectly together and created a balanced and delicious meal. The fish was cooked to perfection, and the whole dish was topped, again, with giant juicy chunks of crab meat. We were both thrilled by all of the food.   Service was quick and friendly, and our server checked in frequently to see if we needed anything. It seemed like she was the only server covering the whole bar area, so I was impressed by how often she was coming around and making sure everything was going well. We were in and out, with drinks and an app and entrees, in just over an hour. Amazing!  There's no doubt we'll be returning, it's just a question as to when we can make it happen!",

My husband and I started with a combo plate of Blue Point and Midnight Bay raw oysters. They were served with mignonette and also cocktail sauce with fresh shredded horseradish. Delicious! Next we had another appetizer of Ponzu Sashimi Scallops. These are described on the menu as being served with pickled ginger, wasabi aioli, wakame and masago. Roland sad they were addictive. Yes. They are. For our entrees, we chose Barramundi, Roland's favorite, and the Halibut which was in season. Both of these fish were grilled to perfection. We mixed up the sides so that we could try more. The coconut jasmine rice certainly did not disappoint. We also had the herb and goat cheese polenta (which was pretty ok), the Yukon Gold Skin on Cheddar Mashed and the Sauteed Summer Squash with Kale. There were many interesting drinks on the menu, but we stuck with a wine that we always love. We ended our meal with one of the best creme brulees we've ever had, Cherry Creme Brulee. I would love to go back to this restaurant and try other menu items! Great food, great service!",

The manager confirmed they would be open for their regular hours and my reservation for six people at 8pm was gladly accepted. So when we arrived on time and found the restaurant dark and empty, we had to scramble to find anything else open. I'm used to Chinese food on Christmas Day but it was a poor substitute for the usually fine seafood and service my family has enjoyed at Bluewater, formerly Fish Market, for over twenty years. No phone call. No warning. No notice. Just a big helping of disappointment. Bah humbug.",

While eating (mouth full ) the waitress approaches the table and begins to ask questions, oblivious to the fact that I'm chewing food and can't answer without spewing food every where. We ordered coffee and desert , the waitress brought the coffee, no cream, no sugar. A good wait staff would have asked if we take sugar/cream when the order was placed. I then had to ask for spoons for the desert and coffee, didn't feel like sticking my finger in the cup or picking up my desert with my fingers. When the waitress brought the spoons to the table she had her palm wrapped around the spoon portion with the handle facing out , very very unsanitary ! She had been handling other customers plates , checks and moving chairs around. For the price you would think they would train their staff on proper sanitation practices as well as proper timing of meal presentation!",

They have a wide variety that changes according to what is fresh/in season and it literally tastes like it is right out of the ocean! Their cocktails are fab as well, they make a MEAN Moscow Mule!   My fiance and I like to sit at the Oyster Bar (shoutout to Mark, he's the best!). Mark always whips up an amazing seared jumbo scallop marinara for me (it isn't on the menu but he is just that much of a rockstar). I honestly crave it! The scallops are like butter, they melt in your mouth. My fiance always gets oysters and by his facial expressions and sounds, it seems that he is in heaven when eating them! Did I mentioned their warm, crunchy sourdough bread? OH MY GAWDDDD, I would come here just for the bread alone! It is SO yum.   They also have a wonderful sushi bar -- LOVE the Phoenix roll! The General Manager, Jeff is so friendly and makes you feel right at home. When we were leaving, the bartender even opened the door for us and told us to have a great rest of the night! It doesn't get much better than that! We will absolutely be back soon!",

Then we had some crab cakes, which were okay. For our entrees, I had the scallop dish and my husband had the halibut dish. Unfortunately, both the scallops and halibut were over cooked and borderline tough...the opposite of how both should be!! The accompaniments were great, we really enjoyed those. Not sure we will be back for entrees, but maybe for a happy hour with oysters.",

He was thorough when explaining the menu, found us some bread (that wasn't a day old), and was that perfect attentiveness.  We started with the calamari fritters, which were non-chewy (translation: cooked perfectly). The mustard-looking sauce is worth dipping into.   I love catfish, but not this catfish, which was bland. Green beans were OK, but the coleslaw was great. After a bite of my daughter's trout, I'd definitely recommend it over the catfish.  The Key Lime pie was creamy and delicious!",

The scallops were cooked perfectly and loved the jalapeno for the extra kick. It was nice to have a clam chowder where there were more clams than potatoes. Also really delicious. We're a tough audience for salmon and they didn't disappoint. OK clearly, the food was awesome. What really topped off the night was our server. She was outstanding. There's a fine line between not rushing people vs ignoring them. Her timing and attention were perfect. Really seems to love her job and it shows. If you read some of my other reviews, I'm pretty tough when it comes to restaurant reviews. The Bluewater Grill in Phoenix is now one of our favorites. We look forward to coming back.",

Will definitely be back.  8/19/17 So, my 2nd time wasn't as good as the first time. Let's start with the good. This time we started with a cup of New England clam chowder, which was very flavorful and I would definitely order again. I ordered the lobster roll hot with butter and I definitely prefer it over the cold with mayo. This time, I feel like they skimped on the mashed potatoes portion. The chocolate lava cake was not as good as the first time either. And our service was definitely NOT 5 or even 4 Stars for that matter. When my water glass is almost empty and I'm waiting and waiting for water that's a PROBLEM.   We will give this place one more chance because I do want to try the fisherman's platter.  9/9/17 Cassandra was our waitress and can I just say she is amazing. I ordered the fisherman's platter. The fries were on the cold side, I only ate a few.  The scallops were delicious, perfectly cooked and sweet. I am not even a fan of cole slaw and let me just say I ate all of it. Now time for dessert...of course I ordered the chocolate lava cake and this time it was DELICIOUS like the first time that I had it!",

Over all I am happy with the experience and would eat here again.  In my opinion this is more the kind of place to have a business lunch/dinner or family dinner. Not the place to take a first date if you are really trying to impress, maybe a 3rd or 4th date would be fine.",

They cracked it prior in a few spots to make it much easier. Since we are trying to eat healthy we had the sauteed Brussels sprouts and sauteed spinach( so yummy) . The chef made it even healthier for use by steaming then roasting. This place never disappoints no matter how many times we have come. If you are from New England this place is a must !! Carmella thank you for being one of the best waitresses I have ever had and for the great dinner experience!!!",

For dinner, my wife ordered mahi-mahi and I ordered trout. Our fish was excellent and the sides were all tasty.  We opted for blackened and it was done just right.  All our food was served piping hot. My only complaint was our unnamed waitress, she nice and efficient but there was no warmth.  She had a bad habit of referring to us as, \"you guys\" and said this about 8 times. Good portions and reasonable prices merit another visit.",

I reserved via Yelp app and it was easy and confirmation came by email and text message. They weren't overly crowded and I thought reservation wasn't necessary for lunch.  I started my lunch with a half dozen oysters. They had two options on the day I visited.  Per my server's recommendation, I tried their lobster rolls. They put generous amount of lobsters, it was quite tasty but I thought creamy dressing was not necessary. I think it is just my personal preference. I prefer my lobster rolls simple with just butter.  Be sure to leave enough room for dessert as they have very good selection. Chocolate ice cream cake I had was very good, I thought the cake was huge at first but I didn't have any problems finishing one on my own.   Service was friendly and efficient. Food came very quick.  I walked by the seafood counter where they sell fresh seafood by pound. They looked so good, I should come back here to purchase to cook at home someday.",

Service was fast, friendly, and we even were able to sit in the bar and watch basketball.  When you walk in to the left you will see all the fresh seafood. They even gave prices on the wall should you want to purchase seafood to take home and cook. We started our meal with Oyster Rockefeller. They came with 4 and I suggest you get a double order! They were cooked perfectly and served with lemon and hot sauce. The sour dough bread they bring to the table is fresh and homemade!!  We then ordered salmon and a pasta that has scallops, shrimp, and an amazing cream sauce. I will be back again for sure to eat more Oysters!! They also gave sushi that looked amazing as well.",

    "text": "There are two things that this New England transplant still misses: brilliant colored fall leaves and fried clams (the whole clam, not those strips that taste like rubber bands!). So, when my husband noticed Bluewater Grill offered whole fried clams, with some trepidation (I've learned not to expect much re seafood in the desert) we decided to check it out. We were immediately seated and Lisa, our server, introduced herself. As first timers, she gave a brief description of the restaurant's ownership and food philosophy and did so with such passion. She clearly believes in the product and enjoys her job and the company. I've found happy employees usually create happy customers. Since the clams were making a high carb impact on my diet, I asked to forego the accompanying fries. When our server offered a substitution, I expressed no preference because I was expecting some dead veggie that had been sitting forever on a steam table. Our dinners arrived -a generous pile of lightly battered WHOLE clams (with the bellies!) that were fried to golden perfection. It was accompanied by a delicious chopped coleslaw--possibly hand cut since there were no errant chunks of massive hard cabbage lurking underneath. Yes, I was practically orgasmic over the clams, but what truly blew me away was the dish of the most beautiful perfectly cooked spinach that came with the meal. While Bluewater Grill is known for its seafood, this attention to detail says volumes about the kitchen. My husband had the Fisherman's Platter. He said it was great but I can't speak from experience. He wouldn't let me taste since I refused to share a clam. Frankly, I was looking forward to my clam \"fix\" but I  never expected to be this impressed. The amount of food was more than ample. I'm glad we didn't order appetizers and there was just no room for dessert. Prompt and friendly service and fresh, well-prepared seafood made this a really great experience. I cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "I don't love fish, but even if I did, I wouldn't love it here.  This restaurant has been here for years.  My first memory of it was when I met a lady from a Cat Rescue program, when I adopted my beloved kitty Fluffy.  Fluffy died recently at the age of 15, but she was an awesome cat.  That memory is the best thing I can say about Bluewater Grill.  As for the restaurant itself, the food is blah.  I admit the food looks beautiful when served, but the taste is just meh.  My fish and chips were average, but the Cole slaw tasted weird.  My husband said his blackened mahi mahi was pretty good, but it was a bit off putting that they charged an extra $1 to blacken it.  Really?  Isn't seafood expensive enough without nickel and diming, people?  The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon made the price a little more tolerable though.    The wait staff was friendly and the service was good.  They even gave me a black napkin when I was seated because I was wearing black pants.  I always consider that a mark of an upscale restaurant.  However, Bluewater Grill isn't upscale.  The location overhangs a freeway and the booths and tables are more reminiscent of a TGIF.  The restaurant does have a fish market with a variety of raw fish available for purchase.  While we were dining, quite a few people came in and bought the fish to prepare at home.  Maybe that's a better idea than dining in here.  IMPORTANT UPDATE  After reading my review, the owner / manager of Bluewater Grill sent me a private Yelp message and expressed his concerns over my negative comments.  I am very impressed that he took the time to read the Yelp reviews in the first place and then reach out to communicate with me.  He's obviously very serious about making his restaurant a better place.  Kudos to him.  :)   And for that, I'm upgrading my original 2 star rating to a 3 star.",

    "text": "I sort of hate leaving a bad review, because I love/d this place...I hope this experience was a 1 time thing for us.  My partner and I arrived around dinner time and were seated in the bar area.  We received our bread and butter... I joked because we got four pieces of bread, and three pieces of butter (and I wish that had been the end of it).   We then ordered appetizers, a mahi-mahi and the king crab legs, as well as some adult beverages.  We waited FOREVER (probably 30 minutes) and our entree's came out...  The appetizers were totally skipped.  The waitress apologized and asked if we wanted them...which seemed pointless.  So we dug into our entrees... Super disappointing.  The mahi-mahi was over cooked.  The risotto was like wall paper paste.   The king crab legs were literally barely above freezing in some areas.   When we asked about the quality of the food we were told the head chef was out that night, and I'm hoping that's True....because they really only have 1 more chance or I wont be back.     They DID comp the drinks, and we didn't end up paying for the appetizers since they never even got ordered apparently, so the bill only ended up being about $60... and we didn't bother with dessert.  They easily lost out on what could have been a $170 ticket.    We were both starving still so we went across the street and got a burger...",

    "text": "I am a little shocked right now. Not only have I not reviewed Bluewater, I somehow even missed posting a review back when the building housed Fish Market! That strikes me as very, very wrong!  I've been coming to this building for fishy meals for a lot of years. And I am sure those memories play into how highly I regard this place.  From the most recent visits -  I can eat my weight in fresh, crusty sourdough bread! The bucket of mussels and clams (which we tend to ask for all clams) is always super tasty (and provides a great broth for soaking into the bread!) Happy hour from 12-5 on Sundays - $4.00 well, wine, draft and several well priced appetizers makes for a fantastic way to day drink, eat yourself stupid and spend a fantastic afternoon without breaking the bank. The raw bar generally has a nice selection, the sushi bar is a-ok. The New England Clam Chowder is the stuff comfort food is all about.  It may not be the swankiest fish house in town. None of the recipes will make you re-think what seafood can be. But it's always fresh, always consistent. Service has always been friendly and the one bad experience I have had here reflects on my own insane family - not the staff, the food or the place. And even the bad experience makes me laugh now.  And writing this review is making me crave the clam bucket and sourdough bread right now!!",

I would've thrown them back, not even oysters.. Far too small. The restaurant week menus consists of a three course meal.. First, we had to ask for a restaurant week menu... Come on! They originally sat us in an odd corner at a 2 person table (yes there were only 2 of us, but we didn't want to sit there! ) so we moved to the bar. Service was slow. We ordered appetizers. The crab cakes were pretty good.. Not the best but good. The seared Ahi came with a ton of food, but way under seasoned and therefore they didn't taste that great. We each ordered the mahi mahi entree... This was fantastic. The only good thing ordered. Must have if you go. Took desert to go.   Overall, the mahi was nice. But that's it. I won't be going back.",

We have also loved Bluewater Grill for our go-to date place when we crave seafood, and we have always been curious about the upstairs area. A few months ago we found out they were renivating the upstairs area for events, rehearsals, etc., and we had joked about having our rehearsal dinner there in the future. Well, to my surprise my fiance and his friend partnered with the manager about setting up the proposal upstairs alone, then having a party for me with my close family and friends in the bar afterwards. They even had our favorite service come in and serve us. They were so amazing!   Thanks Bluewater grill and thanks to Rachel our fav server!",

A little disappointed we only received two scallops.  Since it was a special occasion we each ordered a dessert. My wife ordered a crem brulee and I ordered a raspberry sorbet.  I've never seen so much sorbet served following a meal - easily 6 -  7 oz.  Unfortunately I couldn't even finish half of it and it's not something you can take home in Phoenix during June.

In conclusion left the place 40 bucks lighter with a bowl of chowder,a small serving of clams and a bud, I might go back after the snowbirds have cleared out but it will definetly be a while.",

The rolls that I ordered and shared were also excellent and even my mostly gluten free daughter broke down and had part of one.  The scallops my daughters split were probably the best I've ever tasted, and they agreed.  They also got mussels that they said were excellent (don't eat those either).  We didn't save room for dessert, but were full and very satisfied with the food and service.  We ate out on the patio -- nice area there as well.  I would definitely go back.",

Everything was exactly to order. Oysters were good, but the meat was small. Scallops are good here. I recommend getting anything with scallops. All in all, it got 3 stars because it wasn't amazing, it doesn't leave me with the sense of, I need to have more. Definitely a decent place for seafood in Phoenix. ~I would not do the sushi here, just so you know. ~  Also its pricey, i guess you are getting it imported from another state.",

Our server was Cliff and he really knows the menu well; can make great suggestions if you are on the fence, like I was. I ended up with the clam chowder and two appetizers: the edamame and the seared scallops with pancetta and a wasabi aioli. My husband also had the clam chowder and the fish and chips. The seared scallops were the best we have ever tasted and the wasabi aioli was the perfect compliment. My husband loved his fish and chips and was surprised with how good the cole slaw tasted as well! Cliff provided excellent service and together with the great food, he made sure we will be returning to the Bluewater Grill soon! Awesome!",

If you're going to charge almost $30 a plate, please make sure the risotto isn't bland. Or there is only ONE scallop in my dish. My bread was so crunchy I couldn't eat it.

I WANT to know the country of origin my fish is from and whether it is wild caught, sustainable or farmed. When I'm paying for something with my own money I make informative decisions and want to know exactly what I'm getting.     They serve the EXACT fish that they have on the menu--NO Substitutes. I think that the majority of consumers aren't aware that restaurants AND grocery stores can serve fill-ins or substitutes for the actual fish and essentially lie about what they are serving.

One scallop was still somewhat raw in the middle (and cold) and the shrimp tasted like they were fished out of a swimming pool (shrimp shouldn't taste like chlorine). Both were underseasoned... actually, maybe not seasoned at all. The couscous was cold and gummy (eww) and typically, I love couscous! The only redeeming quality of my entree was the spinach. Sad.   My server was awesome - quick, attentive, kept my glass full. She asked how my meal was, I said \"meh. It was okay, I guess.\" She seemed concerned and said in the future, if I wasn't happy, I should let them know right away so I can swap things out. I thought it fair to give it a shot though. Big mistake. I got home a short time after and was so sick!!!!!   I won't be going back. I should have kept True to my \"no seafood in land locked states\" rule.",

We then realized that they had a small market in the front of the restaurant.  They sat us toward the back and the place was not very busy.  The restaurant decor kind of reminds you of a Mcgraths.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect at this point.  Our server came over and everything was excellent from that point on.  The service was perfect.  Drinks were tasty, my wife had something with a strawberry mash in it that was great.  A small, but nice selection of craft beer on tap.  Then our dinner came out and it was delicious!  I had the fire grilled mahi mahi and she had the fire grilled barramundi.  I would highly recommend both!  I had them leave off the balsamic syrup on my mahi, which I would recommend to anyone to do the same.",

They cost less than the so called fish restaurant Red Lobster who tried to give him snow crab legs because he was only 10, under the guise of being king crab legs. Food always good and fresh , I expect to pay a little more because of the freshness. Never been disappointed in food or the service. Going there at the weekend!",

Even if you're by yourself!  I couldn't stop ordering more oysters. Dinner will be finally be.... Wild prawn linguine! Of course!

The decor is very reminiscent of 80s Red Lobster so my expectations were low despite the location of this restaurant.  Boy was I in for a surprise though. Fish was DELICIOUS. Fresh, perfectly cooked, exactly as ordered. Husband had fish and chips and they were not breaded to death pieces of unknown fish. They were just right pieces of fresh cod. I had the scallop and shrimp skewers and they were perfect. It's so easy to over do scallops but these were on the money. Our server was a delight and even hurried things along when we told her we were heading to a show.   I am very much looking forward to a return trip to dive into the menu a bit more thoroughly!   Thanks Bluewater Grill for exceeding my expectations!",

    "text": "First let me start by saying that the entry into the restaurant are wood planks that are unsteady and need repair.  Make sure you assist any elderly walking up to the entrance.  For appetizers we had fried calamari, which were a bit over cooked but good flavor.  The bucket of steamed mussels and clams were excellent as were the crab cakes.  The bad was that we did not get any of the delicious sour dough bread until after we were done with our appetizers.  Not the fault of our server.  The kitchen was behind and did not have enough available.   I had the sand dabs which had some of the skin still on and gave them a sour taste.  My son had the Cajun Swordfish, which was outstanding.  My daughter had the Mahi Mahi over risotto which she loved and my folks shared the fresh Halibut, which they thought was great also.  For dessert, everyone had the crepe brulee, which was excellent.  The service was slow to start but improved once our server realized we were downing iced tea and water rapidly.  As far as the iced tea, it was $3.75, which I think is ridiculous.  Other than that, pricing is about what you would expect.  Overall, the food was good and we will definitely go back, but will not bring back mom and dad until they repair or replace the wooden walkway.",

He made me a special that was his own creation--a grilled oyster with onions, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. It was phenomenal. The chef also came out and gave us a tasting of this delicious albacore. It was phenomenal!   The best cooked oysters and albacore tuna I've ever had. Ben recommended some great wine pairings as well, and honestly u can't get a better food and dining experience than the Bluewater Grill.",

Our waitress, Maddie, was very sweet and attentive and had a great sense of humor (at least, she was willing to put up with our rambunctious table).  For $25, we had either beer and sake to pair with the three different types of tuna or, for the non-beer-drinkers, a nice glass of Sauv Blanc wine.  Each tuna was served two different ways, one raw and one seared, and they were served on a plate of soy-sauce noodles with sprouts.  Most entrees at this restaurant fall in the $17-25 range, so when you look at it, $25 is a good deal for an entree and a drink.  We also devoured a basket of delicious fresh-baked bread.  I was a little bit disappointed, though, that we didn't get to hear from the chefs and sommeliers; the advertisement stated that we would learn recipes and pairing secrets at the tasting event, but this didn't seem to end up being part of it.  When you come here, don't forget to check in on Yelp!  They've got an awesome check in deal.",

Hostess sat us in the bar area next to where they prepare the sushi. Our waitress Chevy was at our table within minutes to take our drink order and ask if we had any questions regarding the menu.   Bread and drinks arrived. Bread was hot and fresh, but we had no utensils, only chopsticks were on the table. When my husband asked for table wear she made a funny and bought it right away.  We ordered. King crab for him with rice and mashed yukons. I ordered a bowl of New England clam chowder and appetizer order of scallops and fennel salad.  We waited, and we waited, while our drinks had run dry. The 2 ladies that were seated behind us after we were received not only their appetizer but their entrees while we waited, and waited.  Finally, our food arrived.   The chowder, the best I have ever had. Full of large clams and small diced potatoes. The scallops presentation was spot on, but they had sprinkled black pepper over them which over powered the delicate sweetness of the meat. The fennel salad was good but not sure if I would eat with scallops. My husbands 2 crab legs were huge and split for easy eating. My husband said the 1st leg was wonderful but the 2nd had that iodine taste some seafood has. He didn't touch the sides. The potatoes looked like a pile of paste on the plate. I thought the rice looked good but he didn't want to eat it. He said he wasn't t sure his plate was worth the $50 price tag.  Overall, the experience was pleasant enough, but a little expensive. I would go back for the chowder and bread if I was looking for lunch on a cold rainy day.  Restroom was clean but the trash was overflowing with used paper towels.",

The menu has a large variety of seafood from all over.   As someone who personally grew up on the East Coast, I know and love seafood!! The clam chowder here brought a tear to my eye because it reminded me of home. All of the food was fresh and perfection! Even the risotto was spot on! Plus they give bread and butter with your meal.   At the front, they sell seafood for you to take home. I bought some chowder for the road and I found out they can special order Haddock for me anytime!! Nobody offers haddock here!   Anyways, I found my seafood haven and I couldn't be happier!!!",

Our server Ericka on the other hand was absolutely the worst I've ever experienced . She never even told us her name until the third time she came and we had to ask. My Father said \"hey there\" to ericka and she didnt even smile and responded with \"hi\". She didn't ask how any of us were doing , she left us waiting for our water and soda refills for atleast 10mins and she never brought the straw I asked her for. When we were ordering and asking questions about the menu she said \"it says it right there on the menu\" .I would hope that the server would be a little more informative or atleast polite . She would walk away before we were even finished speaking to her.  We asked her to bring two sodas and she came back with one and my father asked her if she could bring out another and she responded \"I did bring out another soda?\"with the dirtiest look on her face. We were in shock that we went to spend good money on seafood and our server didn't even smile. I honestly won't even go there again I get better service at Dennys if you ask me .",

When I moved to Phoenix I was really sad that I would probably be missing fresh seafood more than anything, but Bluewater Grill has it, and it is on point! I've had mahi mani, snapper, and a couple other fishes, all fantastic. The mahi special with risotto is my personal favorite. I've also dined at the sushi bar a few times (happy hour every day 3-6) and would say they have the best sushi I've personally had, and the chef is very nice. Oysters on the half shell, delicious as well. You also have the option to purchase market fresh fish from the restaurant, which I keep forgetting but is definitely on my list. If you're someone who fishing and fresh seafood are important to you, and found yourself somehow in the desert, you won't be disappointed by this restaurant. It's also my go to place to bring visitors from out of state.",

And I don't want anyone to think I'm one of those people who is unhappy because it's not the Fish Market anymore.  Yes change must happen... and they've made many good changes.  I think it's a good formula for success... but I will not be back.  I've been coming to this restaurant since 1990.  back in the day, I was a fan because of the great seafood.  and that hasn't changed... they still bring fresh fish into town from their own fishing fleet like they always have.  this is a rare treat folks... especially in Phoenix where fresh fish is only available at a few elite places.  but about 5 years ago, I began coming here for their excellent sushi bar.  and that's the part that I'm unhappy about.  yes they still do good sushi... but they have dumbed down the menu... many of the best items aren't even on the menu anymore.  I could live with that until they eliminated the baked green mussels.  it was the best thing.  best thing!  and it's simply not there anymore.    why get rid of something so sublime and delicious?  this was the one thing I always ordered, and even brought out of town friends here to show them.  but sadly, it's no longer available.  and if I can't get that, there's no reason to return to this place.  so, sorry guys... sorry Wade and Tim who I've been happy to work with for over ten years... I've paid my last visit.  UPDATE:  The manager of BG contacted me via Yelp to let me know that the green mussels will be back... if so, I will too.",

Nice ambiance and atmosphere.   Rock Star service from bartender Heather. She went above the call of duty in her service. I really admire and make note of when a server goes the extra mile. She brought out samples of BOTH of their chowders for us to taste as they were trying new recipes. The New England Chowder was creamy goodness and out of this world. At the end of the meal she offered without prompting to put our drinks in plastic cups to go. Nice extra effort Heather.   Food:   Sourdough bread had great flavor - bit hard on the end caps though.   I had Mahi-Mahi Sliders and they were awesome! Fish seasoned and cooked perfectly. It came with a roasted 1/2 roma (?) tomato that really added flavor to the bite sandwich. Only issue is I bit into it and the friggin' tomato squirted on my shirt. Oh, the bun was also above par buttery and fluffy.   Wife ordered a burger, yes a burger in a fish house - blasphemy I say! Oh well, to each their own. Usually the last thing you want to order in a fish house; however, BWG serves a good a$$ burger. I was pleasantly surprised as my wife gave me a few bites. Bonus for ye ol' land-lovers.   Need to go back for dinner and hit that raw bar.   Double thumbs up for BWG!!",

    "text": "Last night was my first experience at Bluewater Grill - and I was very impressed.  One of the Managers is a real wine connoisseur and spent a great deal of time going over the whole wine menu with my husband and me.  He has great pride for the wines - as he has personally selected every one and has a number of \"exclusives\".  He helped us select a fabulous Italian red that was great for our meal!  To start we had the oysters on the half-shell, which were FABULOUS with fresh grated horseradish shaved on top of the cocktail sauce, which we blended in (I suppose some people may scrape it off, but I LOVE HORSERADISH).  I enjoyed the King Crab Legs, which were plentiful and delicious.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough lemon, which I should have asked for more when I ordered them, since I know I use quite a bit.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was that there was no hot cloth to wash my hands with before or after the crab, and not even a wet wipe.  My husband had the scallops, which were served with a delicious spinach and mushroom sauce.  I didn't try them, but he raved about them.  We each opted for our own dessert.  I was hesitant because it was a list of all the typical desserts that are often pre-bought and just served.  But to my surprise, they make all of their desserts on premises.  I had the Key Lime Pie which was tart and scrumptious and my husband had the Chocolate Volcano.  David, the Manager who was so helpful, told us that on Sunday, Mondays, and Tuesdays they have 1/2 off bottles of wine - so I think we will be back on one of those days to try some of the ones he recommended that we weren't ready to \"invest\" in.",

The birthday dessert was a brownie with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce drizzled on it which was fine. But the waitress didn't even bring it, someone from the kitchen brought, stuck a candle in it, lit it and left. We just sat there looking at each other.  Another table had a birthday and their waitress actually brought them their dessert and sang! By far the worst meal and experience we've ever had here.",

The spinach, crab, and artichoke dip wasn't as bad as our faces may have shown, but it was different and lacked flavor of the crab and there wasn't any cheese flavor at all either. It, much like the rest of the meal was very bland. The scallops had a gritty texture as if they were drug through the sand and then thrown on the grill. The cod for the fish and chips had a light and fluffy batter, but the cod lacked any flavor whatsoever. The lemon wedge served with the cod couldn't really save the poor fish.  The golden cheddar mash though...delicious.",

They have a counter where you can buy the good, or you can belly up to the bar for their food.   It has been a bit since I have had a legit cup of chowder. We had some shooters at our wedding last year and it was amazing of course, but to sit with oyster crackers and REALLY enjoy a cup...I would say its been about 2-3 years! This was really good New England style chowder. I had the half tuna sandwich and the cup of soup. The sandwich was good. I was hesitant to get anything bigger because even the half was a bit portion for me. I will have to take the hubby back so we can share a couple things because everything that came out, including the lobster roll, looked and smelled amazing.  Hubs is a huge seafood fan and I would love to take my parents there, because like me, its hard to find the good stuff in AZ, but this place has it!",

They got 4 stars today instead of five because the service was a bit subpar We kept having to flag him down to order and he never asked what sides we wanted so fries apparently is what we chose though we would have liked to try something more original sounding from the menu.  My drink also came out wrong.  A few more moments conferring with the client would go a long way in providing a better experience, we will be back to try it again when we are in the area.",

When you walk in you see the lobsters in the tank and they have a bar with television sets so that you can catch a game if you want to. On the other side there's also a dining area. Our waitress was really nice and she gave his recommendations because it was the first times we had been there. We both ordered from the Fresh Fish section and I got a skewer no actually two skewers of jumbo shrimp with a side of cheddar mashed potatoes and a cup of Fruit. My husband ordered the grilled salmon with Cajun seasoning mashed potatoes and french fries. The food was cooked to Perfection It Was Juicy and Delicious and it didn't take too long to arrive at our table. The prices are really reasonable for what you get and the service is outstanding. It was the best place to go celebrate my early birthday. I really recommend this place for everyone who's looking for something different than the usual.",

I've lived in Paradise Valley for over 40 years and eaten at most of the better Sea Food and other Restaurants in the Valley.  I've also traveled extensively, including the West coast and my mother's family (and many generations before her) lived in a little town south of Boston were I spent a lot of time growing up and visiting as often as I can so I know and love good Sea Food, particularly east coaster lobster, lobster rolls, Ipswich fried clams, scollops, clam chowder and fish from that area. Blue Water Grill also have periodic specials including bake stuffed lobster and starting July 12th (and for the remainder of the month of July) a traditional New England Lobster Clambake which I very much enjoyed on the evening of July 12th.  Simply put, it was as good as any I have had over a lot of years in Boston and in the New England area!  All Blue Water Grill's Sea Food is great but if you like New England Sea Food, there just is not a restaurant in the Valley that can even begin to compete with Blue Water Grill.  Another favorite of mine in their San Francisco Cioppino.  You'd have to go to San Francisco to find any as good.  I think their secret is that they don't try to compete with steak houses and other fancy restaurants that try to have a menus to pleases everyone. They just serve Sea Food and darn good Sea Food at that! Bill P",

Even though I went with the lunch option the coconut rice was amazing and the mixed fish bowl was so fresh and tender! Totally recommend that if you're able go here!!

The first time wasn't so great, so I decided not to write a review until I had given it a second chance.I went through the photos of food and made some decisions in advance.  I hoped to avoid disappointment by picking things that I had seen and I knew looked delicious. My food was not delicious.  It was soggy and did not taste fresh.  The spongey watery texture and flavor tasted like it had been frozen.  In every photo, one dish was served with a fresh cilantro sauce atop a salad of cucumber and cabbage slaw.  Mine was supposed to come with watercress and peppers in a burre blanc sauce.  No sauce, no watercress, just a few strips of pepper.  in addition, the dish had been created using a less desirable parts.  I would expect that of a lesser establishment, but not from a place that charges upward of $25 per entree.",

The only positive about this was our appetizer which was crab and spinach artichoke dip. That I enjoyed at least. After that, I ordered a 10 ounce steak medium well and my bf ordered salad. I waited at least 20 mins for my steak and I was super hungry. The steak was really salty like they put the whole bottle of salt. I complained and told them I didn't like it. I ordered sushi instead and didn't enjoy that either. I waited long for the waitress to come back to my table and refill my water. She took so long. I felt like she forgot about our table and assisted other guests. I won't be back here, I didn't enjoy my anniversary dinner nor service. This restaurant did poor on everything.",

This place has delivered some of the best seafood and a menu to match with a reasonable price point that I can not find anywhere. The management is top notch, servers all know their fish and on top of it, I usually end up buying some fish from their martket to take home as I can't get over their freshness.   If you are looking for a great dining experience that wont break the bank while offering a wide variety of seafood and sushi (and non seafood) options, I highly recommend this place.",

Both were very good. I was even happier as you will be hard pressed to find anyone in the valley who serves the Manhattan style chowder.  He ordered the farfelle with shrimp and scallops which he thought was excellent. I ordered the linguini and shrimp which was very tasty.  The service was excellent. In fact, they thought our food took too long to come out (we  didn't seem to think so), so the waitress apologized profusely and wanted us to know that the management was buying us dessert for our wait. We were blown away by this, since the wait didn't seem long.  Actually, the manager himself came by also to apologize.  The dessert was the banana's foster tower....OMG....it was awesome...  All in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience and we'll definitely be back.",

I can, however, have seafood so my friend an I were looking for a place that served simple seafood dishes without a lot of pasta and/or cream sauces.  Bluewater Grill was the perfect place.  It was fairly quiet and nearly empty but it was early on a Thursday evening so that might be way.  Our waitress was very nice although she did mix up my order.  No worries though because I ended up with a better option anyway.  We had the Grilled Artichoke appetizer which was amazing!  I'm going to have to try that at home!  I'd definitely go again especially when I can finally have bread and pasta again because I'd very much like to try the Salmon Crostino!",

    "text": "Those who liked the Fish Market won't be dissappointed here, and those who didn't like Fish Market may or may not be impressed enough with the slight upgrades to like Bluewater.  We went with friends after the opera, and we started at the bar with oysters and clams.  Despite a quickly-remedied miscommunication with the server (who I think couldn't believe we ordered THAT many oysters), the oysters and clams were excellent.  The new stools were oddly high and interspersed with tall chairs at normal heights.  On a stool I towered over my friend in the tall chair, and did not ahve enough room to get my knees under the bar.  The bartender said the too-tall stools were going to be shortened. Until then, avoid the stools.  Not much else has changed since Fish MArket.  Some new lighting, a stand-up bar separating the oyster bar and lobby area, a bit less junk on the walls (still fishing pictures and stuffed fish), a new fish counter for buying fish to go... and that's about it.    The menu is also familiar.  The appetizers looked the same, Ducket's Bucket included (thank goodness).  Similar entree selections; various fish in various ways.  I ordered the halibut in sweet chili sauce, and asked for the sauce on the side.  It came on the fish, not on the side, and was to sticky, yucky sweet.  I wasn't all that hungry, so I dug into the non-sauced interior and the halibut itself was pretty good.  My friend ordered the same thing but did not notice the \"sweet\" mention on the menu, and she absolutely hates sweet entrees.  She told the waiter she made a wrong choice, said it was clearly her fault, and wanted to order something else.  He was extremely gracious (I think he took it off their tab) and brought a crab and arugula salad that she insisted I taste....and I'm glad for that because it was fab - lots of hunky crab in a very light slightly mayo sauce, atop fresh greens.  i'll go back for that.  My husband had more oysters, and I already commented on those. Yummy.  After the meal, they brought out complementary bananas Foster, which was ok if it's in front of me, but I wouldn't order it.  The sauce was too overly cinnamon and sticky syrupy.  Service throughout the whole meal was nice, and despite us shutting down the place they made no move to hurry us out.",

Our experience was not only a treat for or taste buds, but the extensive knowledge of the chef and bar manager/wine pro made it an educational experience. I highly recommend stopping by Bluewater Grill for one of their tastings or just for your favorite seafood dish.....they have great sushi too.",

He was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. He even warned me about ingredients that weren't listed in the descriptions of menu items. Thank you!

We both ordered the surf and turf and it was spectacular as well. The ribeye melted in your mouth, the lobster casserole was not what I expected and pleasantly surprised.

I ordered half a dozen of oysters (half from maryland and the other from washington) to start and my dad ordered the crispy calamari fritti. Both were delicious. The calamari wasn't too chewy and the batter was very light so you didn't get that usual \"sick\" feeling when you eat a lot of fried food. For our main course, I had the alaskan king crab with a side of polenta and sauteed squash. My dad had the shrimp and scallop skewers with sauteed squash and cheddar mash. I LOVED the polenta! However, I was a little disappointed about how the crab turned out. The ends were cooked too long, so they had a very bland, dry taste to them. The inside was better. We were in a rush to go to the airport, so I made do with the meal. But, I need to remind myself, it is crab in the southwest...",

I ordered a bowl of the chowder, but only received a cup, thankfully, as it was as tasteless as canned cream of potato soup with a can of clams thrown in.  In fact, I suspect that is exactly how it was prepared.  For entrees, we ordered the scallops and the crab legs.  There was more mushy spinach flavors than anything else in the scallop dish and the five small scallops were very overdone.  The king crab was done well, but frankly heating up frozen crab takes little culinary mastery.  The side of fries was cooked petfectly, crispy outside, flaky inside.  If only they had been served hot....  The good value on the bottle of Meomi pinot noir was the lone highlight of the meal.  We have driven past this place for years - we will continue to drive past Bluewater for years to come.  Stopping there yesterday was a mistake.",

The last time I was there I ordered a salmon lunch. It came with a side I chose Brussels sprouts. They were basically raw. So hard. Could even bite into them. Crunchy. I told the waitress and she said next tine order them well done.. offered me a dessert on the house which I didn't even want. The salmon was too fishy tasting for some reason.. not fresh. I barely ate anything. Daughter had the eel sushi and it wasn't worth mentioning. As always I comment on price and this time I can easily say it wasn't worth the expense. Shame I cannot find a good fish restaurant that is fresh.",

She just stood at the table several times really serving no purpose. We asked about a menu item and she said she had to check- came back 15 minutes later to get our order and we asked the question again and we got an \"oh yeah\". We asked to have the kids meal starter asap and then we ordered. First entree was right, second the sides were wrong, third was the kids meal that we asked to start early which was all wrong, fourth was missing the sauce, these were all delivered by the manager on duty, and we say the kids meal is completely wrong. Server completely forgot the fifth which was a soup, she runs and gets it and brings the wrong soup. The kids meal shows up 10 minutes later, on a hot plate. No refills on any of the drinks. She actually remembers the birthday dessert for the child at the table. Bill is dropped off, 10 minutes later she comes to pick it up and we ask to talk to the manager who is hiding with her in the server station. We express our concerns to the manager about service and how 4 out of 5 entrees were wrong and how the child got their food last, she could really care less. We asked to have a few appetizers removed or something, this whole dining experience was awful. Manager gets defensive and returns with a new bill. Comped a few items but customer service completely goes out the window. Half of us at the table are in the restaurant business so this display of service was shocking to say the least. But the food was good like it has been at other locations we have been to but tonight overall was completely disappointing.",

    "text": "The Bluewater Grill is a family of Seafood Restaurants that are located in Resort Communities. This restaurant serves Sustainable Seafood and Harpooned Swordfish from their own harpoon boats.  The building is very large and looks very old fashioned. As you enter you walk past a small fish market where you can purchase some hard to come by fish like walleye. Many family photos of fishing trips grace the walls. Most of the chairs have fish motifs on them. It sure doesn't feel like Phoenix here.  Our server was very friendly and also very welcoming. She truly seemed very sincere that she was happy we were dining here. After we ordered we get a very large loaf of sour dough bread that is extra sour just like they serve in San Francisco.  I soon receive my Walleye Pike. I give them credit for removing the skin. (most places don't bother) ........But I think we had someone new cooking there because my fish arrived in many pieces. Usually Walleye is very meaty but not all but most pieces of my fish were thin and almost didn't seem like meaty walleye. The fish was ok.....it wasn't undercooked.....maybe a tad overdone..my fish didn't flake at all. The Sauteed Spinach was really great. It was very fresh, sauteed nice and was very buttery. The Red Quinoa was a little weird. It had beets in it and slivered almonds. It also had these black leaves in it that were bitter tasting.....it was weird to me.  My husband asked for the Cioppino....he wasn't asked what size he wanted so the waitress ordered the large for him and suggested to also get the linguini with it. He received very thick marinara sauce, over done clams, ok mussels, good crab, excellent shrimp, VERY OVER DONE Scallops and good fish.   We found that the food on our visit was hit and miss. You might get luckier and visit them when a better cook is on.  3 stars means OK but I have some reservations",

I tasted a friend's sushi and it was fantastic - again, unique combinations and well executed.    Here's where it falls down for me: the decor and complete lack of ambiance.  I was here when it was The Fish Market and I swear they haven't changed much, if anything.  It feels like you're in a low rent Red Lobster.  The old wood grain everywhere, the fish on the walls... it all just smacks of the cheesy pirate seafood restaurants depicted in 80's movies.    Location-wise, it's adjacent to the Esplanade area and it was half-empty at 7 p.m. on a Friday night.  I think they're missing out on a lot of business because the food just doesn't match the experience of dining there.  I think if they renovated the inside with a sleeker, sexier less-feeling-like-a-pirate-might-jump-out-at-you, this could really be something special.",

My wife had the salmon and she said that it was the best salmon she had ever had. Our friends had the mussels and a seafood salad and they both really enjoyed it. Blue Water Grill deserves 6 stars but I am limited to 5.",

    "text": "If you're in the mood for some delicious seafood, this is the place for you. I've become a fan of Bluewater Grill and love exploring their dietician-recommended healthy options. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very pleasant and versatile. I've come here for both date night out on the town, as on a normal weekday dinner during a hot summers day in a t-shirt and shorts.   My favorite entrees are the Roasted Salmon with King Crab Salad ($26), Alaskan King Crab 114 LB ($55) and my favorite sushi roll, the Senorita Roll ($15) and Oysters. The lobster comes in its full shell form and glory, so be prepared to put on the bib and get your hands dirty. If you can't get enough of sushi, you absolutely have to try their Senorita Roll. It's simply amazing, and order it every time. It is pricey for a sushi roll, $15, but it's worth every penny.   If you enjoy a good cocktail like I do, you're in luck here. I have not had one drink that I did not love! Feeling like a margarita? Try the Serrano Margarita and the Pilikia Margarita. The Cucumber Mojito is great during the summer, obviously. My partner loves drinks with St. Germain Elderflower liqueur, so he always orders the 'Violetta (Vodka, fresh lime, and pineapple juice, St. Germain Elderflower, Creme de Violette, Luxardo Maraschino liqueur). The waiters have always been so attentive and do not disappoint. Will continue to keep coming here.",

    "text": "Coming from the West Coast, I've been cautious about eating seafood in a land where even the cactus look dehydrated. When I saw the Tuna Takeover Tasting event though, I knew it was time to adventure beyond the occasional poke restaurant. It was a gamble that paid off for sure!  Food: We had a group of four, and we were all doing the tuna tasting. Each tasting was $25 and came with your choice of a giant Sapporo (Not erm... Sephora, Mark H.) and sake, or a glass of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. The tasting was a plate of Soba noodles (made from buckwheat) and about 6 pieces of fresh tuna. There were 3 types of tuna: bluefin, Big Eye, and Ahi. The noodles were lightly seasoned with probably a ponzu dressing and topped with these delightfully spicy sprouts.  I was a little worried about whether there would be enough food at this tasting to satisfy all our appetites, but with the complementary bread and butter, it was sufficient.   Service: Our waitress was excellent. Madi made us feel like old friends and took great care of us during the entire evening. I would come back again because of her.   Room for improvement: The reason this restaurant/event didn't get my 5 stars was because I expected more from the tasting. I was expecting more of an 'event' where, like the online descriptions reported, we'd get to learn more about fish and sustainability. It would have been better if there were a few smaller dishes, rather than just one dish with the different types of tuna interspersed.   I'll be back to this restaurant - the table beside us got some amazing smelling chowder and I must try it.",

My wife had sand dabs - nice fish, but the sauce was lacking something - the flavor she expected just wasn't there.  My scallops were.....okay.  Nice waitress, friendly and timely service.

The big reason for dropping to four stars is that some menu items were grossly mispriced. In lieu of an appetizer, my husband ordered a cup of the Manhattan clam chowder and I ordered a side salad. He enjoyed his chowder, but thought the price was a bit excessive for the couple ounces of soup in the cup. My salad was largely iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and cucumber pieces and was marked $7.50. The dressing was bland and needed a good dose of salt and pepper. I expected a little more. Other than that, our food was good. The blackened halibut was delicious. The sides, however, were nothing special. Mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach are fairly standard fare. My husband enjoyed his barramundi, but admitted that the halibut was better. I will say that the key lime pie was definitely worth ordering. We would definitely return - just make some different decisions.",

Sashimi scallops are raw scallops with seaweed and tobiko sauced with ponzu. Instant tastebuds  love.  Octopus charred slowly with a paprika aioli: ai-o-yes! Seared scallops wrapped in bacon with a jalepeno aioli.  Do I need to say more. Yes: more, please!  Barramundi with coconut jasmine rice with greens, I ate the whole thing! I wanted to lick my knife thru the appetizers and my main course. I did taste the cioppino, delish. The missing 1/2 star is based on the lava cake. It was good chocolate, but no lava. Everthing  else was a pleasant surprise and as we left to go our separate ways, we said, \" let's eat here tomorrow!\"  Outstanding price for the quality of our meal ( and quantity).

We sat in the bar for happy hour (only in bar area but goes until 6:30) and were greeted by our waitress AJ. We ordered a spicy tuna ($7) and spicy yellow tail ($6) to start and were very impressed by the size and freshness of the rolls. I had some questions about the combined chowder option and because it was my first time in AJ brought me a sample of each chowder and the combined one, it was awesome! I prefer the New England to the Manhattan but the combo was divine. My husband ordered the Asian wings and slider. The wings were okay, nothing special and the slider was really pretty plain. That is what you get ordering something besides seafood in a seafood restaurant I guess! I ordered the claim appetizer and it came in a light buttery garlic sauce, yum! We were given a basket of bread for the table which was also very tasty. The drinks were discounted for happy hour and very reasonable. I was surprised when the bill came, next time I won't wait for a special occasion to come back and try the lobster roll I have my eye on!",

    "text": "I went here for my first time on a Friday at 6pm. We got seated immediately. It wasn't busy at all and business didn't seem to pick up much as the night progressed. That's sad for a Friday night :( our server was nice but lacked enthusiasm for her job. I don't remember her name though.   We were a party of seven and we ordered grilled artichoke, two Mahi Mahi fish plates, two grilled trout plates, one breaded trout plate, one snapper plate, and one kids fish and chips.  Stuff I tried and my opinion: -The bread: the sourdough bread was good. Just the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.  -The grilled artichoke was okay. It was bland and boring.  -Mahi Mahi plate: it was decent. The fish just needed some salt and more flavor. I was not a fan of the vegetables. There were barely of any of them and they didn't taste good. They were too sour. It was on top of a creamy risotto which was very different for me considering the fact that it was my first time trying it. It was good though! -The breaded trout had some type of almond breading. That was different but I liked it! The mixed vegetables were crunchy and fresh. The cheesy mashed potatoes were BOMB! I could eat a full plate of that!   For all these 7 plates, 1 appetizer, 1 beer, and five beverages, it costed over $215.   I have mixed feelings about this place. I don't know if I'll ever come back or not.",

    "text": "Not sure why I haven't written this sooner but I love bluewater. Having lived in coastal states my entire life before coming to Arizona I have a solid appreciation for seafood in all forms. After originally coming here as part of a yelp event where they wowed us with some great food I knew I had to come back (this review only pertains to non-event visits).  I have come back several times including for restaurant week (spring), my girlfriends birthday (Samantha S.), restaurant week (fall) and to celebrate Sam buying a house. I think it's safe to say we love this place.  I happen to love how fresh everything is and that the preparations are always perfect. My favorite thing so far is probably that I switched out the mahi mahi in risotto with the fresh swordfish and it was amazing. I love the creamy risotto with the acidic tang of the balsamic and tomato. I also have to say there clam chowder is authentic to the New England style and is a must to start any meal. The sourdough bread they give you is also fantastic, not too much of that sour twang but just enough and served hot from the over.  One of the best parts about Bluewater is that it is really relaxed environment, most seafood restaurants with this level of fish quality are more formal, here it's relaxed and comfortable. For those from New England this is more the local seafood restaurant in gloucester than the trendy place in Boston. The prices are also very reasonable and the service is great. I have not had anybody on the waitstaff who hasn't been great.",

    "text": "My experience at Bluewater Grill was one of the best. To preface the story, my boyfriend and I were planning on going to San Diego, California for our anniversary. Unable to make the trip due to extenuating circumstances, we were unable to celebrate our anniversary. Fast forward one week and he surprises me with a trip to Bluewater Grill, which is a good 25 minutes from home.   Upon entering, I was absolutely flabbergasted. I was immediately transported to San Diego, California's the Fish Market. A place that we went with his parents during one of our many trips. Never have I had a bad plate. Everything was the same, but to be honest, it was even better!   I truly had the best service I've ever experienced. I can assure you that we will only ever go when Kat (cat?) is working. She went above and beyond to provide the best service, practically reading our minds. She happily offered things one would normally be reluctant to ask for. Not only was she sweet, nice, polite, smart, but she was witty as well. Very seldom would I write a letter to a manager regarding spectacular service and this is one of those times (I hope the manager sees this review).   So since the service received 5/5 starts, I would give the food 5/5 stars as well. Although it was a bit on the pricey end, we received the following for $70 (before tip):   1 Spinach Artichoke Dip  2 Specialty Fish Entrees  2 Beers (One was super hoppy and delicious).  1 plate of San Fransisco style sourdough bread (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foh.my&s=276e2ebc350073d2f8621da53e522ee7e0b3af05e71440977ab5e373881b8943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oh.my</a>.god).   We asked for a little sample of the clam chowder and it was perfectly thin with tons of crab meat.   I got the mahi mahi with fennel, spinach, and tomatoes in a beet vinegrette over cheesy risotto. Holy cow! One of the best meals I've ever eaten. Next time I'm going for the miso salmon and artichoke appetizer.   I expected to walk outside and be able to walk over to Seaport village in California.   AMAZING!",

The decor and ambiance was nice.  It had a good feel and the customers and staff were very friendly. We didn't have to wait and got a nice booth right near the bar...the service was a little slow because the server assigned to our table was also the bartender and she kept needing to go back behind the bar.  She was very friendly and we were not in a big hurry, so it wasn't a big deal for us.  The food was pretty good. We both had some sushi for an appetizer - the Senorita roll is very good! This is our new favorite roll.  My husband got the swordfish and I got the seared Ahi tuna.  I was a little disappointed in the thickness of the tuna cut.  It was a very thin cut, which was fine since I was pretty full from the sushi.   It was seared medium rare, and the menu said rare, I should of asked for their definition of rare because to me, rare means most of the tuna is still red...it was about 1/2 cooked, it was still fine for me.  The price was a little high for how thin the cut was.  My husband loved his swordfish, he asked for it broiled which is different than the menu description, it was not a problem for the chef and it was done very well.  We will be back, its a good seafood place for the Phoenix area.",

I ordered 2 specialty rolls, the Bluewater Special Roll and the Seniorita roll. EX-CELL-ENT. Delicious and alot of food. The prices were just what I'd expect to pay for such high quality sushi ($14 each). I would definitely return.",

I am new to the Biltmore area and was craving good seafood for lunch take-out.  I had the fried oysters as well as the fried shrimp appetizers and the mahi mahi sandwich.  The oysters were lackluster, underfried and unintelligently packed for travel.  The shrimp to the contrary were overdone and the quality of the mahi mahi was sub par and the blood line had not been removed.  I am by no means saying this restaurant is of low quality and can only speak of my single experience today which was just that.  The only positive I can mention is the amazing bread.  I would have been better served with a $60 Filet-o-Fish from Mcdonalds.",

My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. They were so crunchy and delicious that I didn't even care they had eyes. My fiance really liked the burger slider with Gruyere cheese and french fries. It was a great value we each had a cocktail and split 4 small plates for $30! We will be back to try the calamari slider. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is, I frequently like to preview the online menu before going to a restaurant and some of the advertised prices and entrees were different on the online menu then at the restaurant.",

I wanted to order a sushi appetizer, but was informed that in order to get the 'happy hour' pricing I would have to move to the bar area. I asked the manager why the pricing was different for the same product in the dining room and was told that they wanted to maintain a \"different energy\" in the sushi bar area. Well, my 'energy'  and wallet cannot support that explanation. Prices should be honored for all patrons equally.",

    "text": "Whenever we visit Newport Beach we have to go to the Bluewater Grill.  The seafood is always fresh and it's the best place to get sandabs.  This is a light flakey fish that tastes very similar to lake perch.  I was so happy to discover it in Scottsdale.  We had the clam chowder, which had such great body to it and,if I closed my eyes, I could almost see the sailboats on the water.  It was the best I have found in the Phoenix area.  My husband had the seafood platter with large tasty scallops, shrimp, and fish, so fresh it nearly jumped on his plate.  Never overdone, this was fantastic.  I, of course, had the sandabs which were perfectly sauted and served with a caper sauce or tartar sauce which is also the best I've had in Phoenix.  We will definitely be back and bring friends.",

Wanted Sushi and obviously the sushi chef wasn't there so I only had a choice between Spicy Tuna and Cali Roll-got both and both were falling apart-Taste ok nothing to rave about. I also got the calamari (which I love) but confused on why they give it with a side of cocktail sauce-Danny was the server he was AWESOME-very tentative and knew all the answers to the question's I asked about the menu-On the other hand the manager Jeff I felt ignored our table-As a manager how do you pick and chose which customer's to talk to? Well he spoke to the table directly in front and behind he was loud and clear when saying hello, good bye, thank you but all I got was a look. I wasn't asking for a conversation but a \"thank you for coming\" would have been nice-Oh well 5 stars for Danny (the server), 3 stars for the food, 1 star for Jeff (the manager.

Even the desserts were spectacular.  I'm a very demanding hard-sell when it comes to restaurants, and Bluewater Grill won me over instantly.

    "text": "Great seafood in Phx? Yes! I took the wife and teen kids here for Mother's Day. My wife and I hadn't been back for 18 years-not because we didn't love it then, but kids do take a lot of your time and we live 30 miles away. We always talked about going back, remembered the great food we had when it was called the Fish Market. Besides the name, it was as wonderful as we remembered. I had rainbow trout - excellent, they even breaded it special for me. Wife had blackened mahi ( she always orders it whenever we go for seafood so she is an expert) - she said it was the best.  Son had crab legs (as usual when I am paying) and he was heads down on it until he finished. Daughter loves California rolls and her bestie who came as well had salmon and a fancy sushi roll. I think it's cool that can get pretty much any kind of sushi and a full menu of seafood entrees. Additionally, you can get fresh seafood to take home. This place is just as fantastic as it always has been. Great service, they redid the inside a little bit and added a wonderful little patio. If you're looking for a snooty eatery this isn't it, But it is not a dive either. Right down the middle, with great food. We vowed to not wait 18 years to go back. I can't wait for Father's Day!",

I also ordered fried scallops which are one of my very favorite dishes and they came quickly and were delicious.  Very large, fresh and cooked in a light crunchy batter.

The main dish was delicious baked lobster with herbs and crispy anko breadcrumbs with melted butter for dipping! Simply a delight in my mouth! I enjoyed every mouthful. It was a large lobster so I couldn't manage to finish it.The grilled squash and zucchini was also very lightly salted and tasteful. I didn't really enjoy the mashed potatoes, however. They tasted somewhat instant and didn't have the usual homey-mashed-potatoes taste that homemade potatoes have. It was kind of a thick and dense gluey texture. The rice tasted good as well. I liked the sweet wine that I chose--I do believe it was a dessert wine that my server recommended. All-in-all, I enjoyed the service and food I received here. The space seemed like it could accomodate a lot of people too, which is cool if I ever want to have a dinner party of sorts here with my friends in future.

It's almost all fried/unhealthy, not really seafood-based.  Between me and my guest, we literally couldn't find something good to eat and went to The Parlor instead, which was a great move.",

    "text": "I went there thinking / hoping this place had some resemblance of its predecessor; The Fish Market. Boy was I mistaken. First, there was nothing that resembled a typical lunch menu. Everything on the  menu was $$, including the 1/2 sandwich and fries for 9.95, which I'm sorry I ordered. The sandwich was remarkably small, with 1 small piece of lettuce, slice of tomato and what looked liked a small scoop of tuna. The bread looked like it may have been right out of a loaf of Roman Meal bread. The fries seemed like a normal small portion. When served, I recall how astonished I was at how small the entire combination was and how I knew I would be hungry afterward since I don't eat fries, however, the substitutions came at an extra charge. Which meant I just got a tiny half sandwich for 10 bucks or a tiny sandwich with cole slaw for even more $.  This was a lunch experience that made me angry with each passing moment i sat there fuming, primarily due to the lackluster portion, the price, and the mediocre service.  I really dont like to score a place one star, but in this case, if Bluewater has the stones to sell a small, ordinary 1/2 sandwich for 10 bucks, I feel the need to tell anyone interested how this place offers absolutely no value for the $$.  I will never go back to this place. Once bitten, twice shy as the saying goes.",

    "text": "This place is just okay. Need to get over any images one may have from the days of Nick's , which I know I had (busy fish house in late 1990s). The place has aged, but the food was decent and service not bad. Visited on a week night so things were slow (though it is the holiday season). My guess is it's getting trumped by all the \"hot new\" in Central PHX these days. Go if you really want seafood but it might feel a little like Red Lobster.",

You can take advantage of their fish market-so many delicious options. (All the fish they serve, you can buy) Aside from the food-the waiters/waitresses are all wonderful! Today, we had the best waitress! Kat (or Cat) is so knowledgable, patient, and listens to exactly what you want. She knows her stuff and is detailed oriented! We never had to ask for anything-she was right on top of it all! Thank you for making our night great! And we will be seeing the Bluewater Grill again! :)",

    "text": "We walked frequently to the original South Coast Plaza location of Bluewater Grill, and were very pleasantly surprised to find one right here, on Camelback, in the middle of this Midwestern winter paradise.  All our favorites FRESH (a miracle in PHX) and mostly unchanged from the Santa Ana and Newport Beach offerings: superb fillets and steaks, the seared ahi tuna, and the battered fish and chips (the fish so light and batter so grease-free--amazing and deceptive).  Since sushi is not a feature of the OC menu, I'm not surprised to read that it has been phased out.  What remains, including the hot, fresh-baked Sourdough Bread, is what has made the restaurant a favorite at home.  Friendly (though not overly trained) staffers, a lovely heated patio (ignored by Phoenicians), ample portions (share a Caesar salad, share a fried calamari and a seared ahi appetizer, share a main dish, share a dessert).  Try not to fill up on bread (and yummy butter).  Walk on over, bring the dog, and enjoy the fine spring or fall night air on the candlelit patio you'll have to yourselves.  It's not Durants; it doesn't want to be.",

    "text": "My wife and I and good friends had the pleasure of loving an amazing dinner at Bluewater Grill last night. The place was packed and they kept coming in during our 2 hour experience. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived. The front staff was expecting us and had our table cleaned and ready. The server, Sean was exceptional, friendly, proficient and thorough. He left nothing to chance and was super attentive throughout the evening. We started out with sharing 2 bowls of New England Clam Chowder and the crab cakes. We`ve had really good chowders on the West Coast in Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, but this was as amazing as those. The crab cakes were delectable, moist and prepared perfectly with a great and flavorful dipping sauce. Gregg and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino and it was large, full of delicious shellfish and fish on a perfect bed of linguine. The girls ordered the Fire Grilled Salmon and said that it was the best platter that they had enjoyed in years...No Kidding! We can`t wait to go back again very soon. We highly recommend this dining experience to all!",

    "text": "3.5* I've been to Bluewater a couple times now, and I've had some great food and some that's been so-so.  Our first visit I had the pan seared scallops and my buddy had the miso salmon.  We both really enjoyed our meals, not to mention killer oysters rockefeller and sourdough bread! Our last visit (in addition to the aforementioned oysters and sourdough of course) I tried the prawn and scallop skewer and my buddy tried the chinook.  Now, to me anyway, prawn=BIG shrimp U-15 like. But alas, these were more akin to 21-25.  The food was not hot when I got it which definitely detracted from the dish.  The chinook was average. So, in closing I'd say oysters, chowder and bread will probably be my next meal at Bluewater, never been disappointed in those.",

As far as price, we spend about 70 bucks between the two of us. If you want seafood, this is where you want to get it. Fresh, fresh, fresh!",
