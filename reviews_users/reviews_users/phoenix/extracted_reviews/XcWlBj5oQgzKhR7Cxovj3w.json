The food is extremely over priced and staff were rude. Will never go there again even with over an hour before a flight.",

The manager of the restaurant said that 20+ minutes was a normal time when busy. However, the restaurant is dead. Few folks at the bar. Like us. Just waiting for dessert. Not a fan. The nice folks behind the bar deserve multiple high fives and they tried to make up for the managers poor nature. Brian the manager has the worst customer service I could imagine for someone in his position.  Proceed with caution.",

    "text": "During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do \"La Mad\" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.  Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a \"crouton\" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyere cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.  And speaking of Gruyere...  The truffled Gruyere Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.  The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with \"house made caramel sauce on top\".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.    Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a \"bistro\" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, \"frites\", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices.   3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.",

In all fairness it's airport terminal food so the expectations are not the same. I ordered the Red Wine Short Rib Baguette and a Paulaner Hefi-Weizen. The cost again airport terminal food was higher than expected and the value did not equate. The Baguette was more like a Panini and had maybe 2oz of meat. The presentation was very good with a touch of sophistication but not for the cost. There are many options in #terminal4 but this one I would not recommend.",

The bread was a good quality made with grains and had a slight sweetness that paired well with the sandwich filling. My sandwich stayed neat and never got messy to eat. The bread stayed dry and didn't get soaked by the chicken salad.   This sandwich did cost $13.00 but I thought it was worth it.

We chose this restaurant because it was the only sit down near the terminal. The wait staff was either very good or just phoning it in. Fortunately we had the good.  It's not very often that hubby and I order the same thing. This time we did and it was good. We had (drumroll please) the pork belly sandwich. The sandwich was served hot but the fries were lukewarm. The sandwich was accompanied by a suitable serving size of a delicious spread.   The missing star is due to the disconnect with the serving staff. Some of the staff stood in a huddle reminiscent of a kindergarten soccer team. The huddle moved from area to area. A table near us was not attended. A server learned of the situation and instead of stepping up and handling the problem he called out to another server to let another server know. That's annoying.",

But in the end, it's worth it. I've had their sandwiches several times, and they're always top-notch. The pork belly is a bit heavy, but if you have someone to split it with then it's just about perfect. And their fries will knock yours socks off... but chances are you have a spare pair in your luggage, so that shouldn't be a problem.   If you have a bit of time between flights or before you take off, then you'd definitely do well to pay this place a visit. Sky Harbor has gotten some great places to dine in the past year, and this is definitely one worth a visit!!",

Being on the west coast and a frequent Southwest customer (and one of those people who loves to be on the first flight of the day), I'm generally skirting through PHX before 10am, which enables me to have the breakfast sandwich. A buttery croissant with a fried egg and gruyere. So damn good - enough to make you temporarily forget about the inconvenience of flying through Phoenix. The Bloodies don't hurt either.  The bartenders and servers are also super nice. To be fair, this is early in the morning when things are relatively uncrowded.  In short, I am this person: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonion.com%2Farticle%2Ffrequent-flyer-knows-out-of-the-way-airport-bar-th-1378&s=3ed3781a15337c6bfdeab70b413e78774231502be3a57e33a2eec692d930a8fa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">theonion.com/article/fre...</a> and you should trust my airport recommendations.",

Wait staff very friendly and efficient. Ordered a Zinc burger with bacon bleu cheese and OMG that was the best restaurant burger I've had in years!!!  Big beef patty made of quality beef (not the frozen patty I was expecting). Light and fluffy bun. Arugula, tomato, big chunks of bacon and bleu cheese, onion straws, and some delicious savory sauce. Served with a side of thin cut fries.Asked for a side of Dijon mustard and I was in heaven.   It even had the flavor of a char grill on the patty. Like a fancy home made burger. Yeah, it was $16 but totally worth it compared to other airport food.  This is a do over next time I'm passing through.",

I walked up to he kiosk at the front where it appeared you would wait to be seated. The place was fairly busy and I did see staff moving around. Nobody noticed me for that awkward 2 minutes that felt like 10 minutes. So I just sat at the bar. Quickly I was offered both a menu and asked for my beverage choice. Coffee and water and an omelette was ordered. The menu did have a kind of french twist on most of the classic breakfast items so I liked my choice of place to eat breakfast. I just had to wait for under 10 minutes and the food was delivered. The food tasted fine. Clearly 100% freshly cooked. I was refilled on my beverages as you would expect and the person helping me was very pleasant and very busy. The bill did kind of surprise me even at an airport to pay $30 including tip for omelette, side of bacon and coffee. Seems high even for an airport restaurant but I would still suggest this place if you are flying Southwest out of Phoenix.",

    "text": "We all know how expensive airport food can be and about 6 months ago I decided that is just wasn't worth it. I have been pretty successful in avoiding them but last night I got hit with a four hour delay and suddenly dinner was in play.  Sky Harbor is easily one of the best airports for tasty grub and I have visited quite a few and choosing Zinc Brasserie last night came down to location. Food prices are always jarring at an airport but Zinc's will make your jaw hit the floor.   With that being said I was treated to friendly service, a comfortable seat in a very crowded airport and decent food. It seemed like a relatively fair trade off.  The menu has a French theme and specializes in craft cocktails and wines. If you are a beer drinker, like me, the selection is small. There are 5 taps and they have the American macrobrews, Stella and Kiltlifter by Four Peaks. With the French theme I was hoping for Kronenbourg 1664 on tap.  I ordered the Red Wine Short Ribs Baguette with Frites. The sandwich was dressed with Blue Cheese, Pickled Carrots and Crispy Onions with a Housemade ketchup and Paprika Aioli as dipping sauces for the Frites.   The Blue Cheese was too generous and overpowered the short rib. When I pulled out some short rib on its own it had a comforting pot roast style taste and the carrot was nicely vinegary and added a lot of contrast. The crispy onion was a waste as it did not offer a crunch and was just there. The baguette was nice and soft and had a more sourdough bite to it. Overall, an ok sandwich.  The frites were a bit of a miss. They had a generous paprika seasoning and the aioli mentioned above was very tasty. The frites were overcooked and undercooked in the same batch. The French having invented  this classic appetizer would be none to happy. Side note I just recently watched this show that said the Belgians actually invented the dish.   Overall, I ate my dinner like a good boy. My visit was d'accord.",

However, I took two bites and the pate baguette (which I would never order) was pretty yummy.

When we asked for a larger table she said it doesn't matter because everyone has bags!  We paid $13.50 for a croissant, 2 tablespoons of eggs and two piece of the smallest slices of bacon I have ever seen. After the rude manager ( in the pink sweater) brought the plates to our table, she did not ask us if we needed anything bc she ran off so fast to eat her own breakfast!! We needed salt and pepper and jelly for our crossiant!! The waitress went to the table next to use several times without even even looking our way once. By the time we got her attention our eggs were cold and we were starving. The food was literally a 3 on a 10 scale. Should have went to Panera.. their service is better, even if you have to eat it in your lap!!! Do not go here.. $29.32 for two $5 meals! Melissa (the manager and host) should be fired for her nasty attitude. Also, customers should get more eggs for $13.50",

Isn't it always about the first time, like you remember everything when you had it your first time. Okay, enough about me going on and on lets get to the point. I wish I had read the reviews but I'm not like that and I just go with it. Me and my roommate had an early flight wanted to get a drink or so we landed at zinc this was about 7 am and let me say this the hostess was more presentable and so appreciated more than the waitress . I don't know what her problem was but it was obviously she didn't want to help us out! I observed her being cheery or fake cheery to other guests and it really took like 10 minutes to get in a food order and she forgot about our kilt-lifters which isn't hard to pour on draft. Aside from this the store was definitely NOT busy. At the end of our experience all I had was a measly croissant, for 6 dollars and beer I really wanted to explore more but I felt like the waitress thought j should know what I want or expected that should know stuff on the menu when I walked in which shouldn't be that way! I'm all about customer service and that lady was something else. By the end I just wanted my check and seriously took more waiting time to get my check as well. Other than that I hope I can return If not this'll be my first and last at this location.",

They burger came on a brioche soft enough to cuddle me to sleep at night but durable enough for the patty (I'm not overthinking this - it matters). It all came with pommel frites, house ketchup, and a paprika aioli that rounded off everything with some subtle smoke. Topped off the feast with a Blue Moon and a conversation with a friendly red headed server.   If you're going to spend too much money on food at the airport you might as well spend it on good food. Zinc is REALLY good food.",

I ordered my steak frites medium but it came out practically raw. It was such a fatty piece of meat, I could barely cut it. I asked our waiter for two steak knives and he said, \"We're at an airport.\" Well, that makes sense but there are more polite ways to respond, such as, \"Unfortunately, I can't give any steak knives because we're at the airport and sharp knives aren't allowed.\" We told him the steak was not a very good cut and he just stared at us blankly.  Over-dressed salad. Boring fries (which is crazy because their fries are DELISH at the Quarter). Even the burger was bland and dry.   Would I recommend Zinc? Yes! At Scottsdale Quarter. There are better options at Phoenix Sky Harbor, though.",

I guess they suffer from a captive market in the C-gate area, but the hostess was telling everyone in a firm, no-nonsense manner that there was open seating at the bar. Wasn't offering tables. At least 8 people just left. We asked about a table, and she said it would be 10-20 minutes. We looked back at 5-6 open tables that just needed bussing and said we'd be willing to wait. She huffed off and started bussing tables. When she came back to seat us we saw there were about 15 open tables. She walked us past 3 bussed and spacious 2-tops to put us in a cramped corner table next to the server station- some power move for having to...work? I've never seen a restaurant just turning people away rather than bussing tables and serving customers. The drinks were good, but I feel bad supporting a place with such poor service.  Edit: someone seated next to me asked the waitress if there really was a 30 minute wait for food. She said no, she didn't have that many tickets, and asked where he'd heard that. His response: the hostess. What's going on here?",

It was definitely not a healthy salad, so I was disappointed (I'm not interested in eating salads that are 800+ calories- if I want to consume that amount of calories, I'd rather eat pasta or dessert).

When I ordered unsweetened teas, however, it would have been nice if she'd told me it was flavored tea (Caribbean or something like that) and not black tea.  When I questioned that it was flavored, she told me it was unsweetened (duh!) and told that was all they had.  Then just walked away.  I'm not a big fan of any flavored tea but didn't really have a choice on another drink apparently.    Be prepare to be shoved together with other guests and for crappy service.

The menu has small selection of main courses, which for an airport when you're on the run is perfect. I ordered the Flat Iron Steak Frites plate (minus the Frites, I'm in a low carb diet). And I had a dinner salad with Parmesan Vinaigrette dressing. I've never had that type of dressing before and was actually very impressed, it's now on the \"checklist\" of salad dressings now if you know what I mean. Now I have to talk about the steak. This is an airport, and airport restaurant so I really wasn't expecting much; well I was more than pleasantly surprised! I ordered the steak medium and they cooked it perfectly. The cut of meat was red, moist and extremely tender! I never would have expected this for airport cuisine! I am a steak aficionado (in my own mind , lol) and I would put this up against any steak I've ever had in Arizona!  Why is this restaurant not in my hometown, Tucson and why is it at the airport?  Lastly my server was Kaitlin and she was amazing! Fast, courteous and informative!  I highly recommend this establishment if your ever in the Phoenix Airport, Terminal 4!",

The only person who deserves praise is my wonderful rock star server, Kaitlin, who saved the day with a wonderful disposition and demeanor.   Brian was very rude. I politely approached him asking who my server would be, and he asked where I was sitting. In a non-chalant tone, he responded \"yeah, he'll be right there, we are busy.\" It's obvious that they were busy, but that wasn't my question. I was simply asking who my server was so I could flag him/her in an ocean of people. I then responded, \"I understand, I'm just asking who my server is.\" He said \"yeah, we are busy\" in an arrogant way. Ya think?!  Kaitlin, on the other hand, managed the situation like a pro. She offered an apology in a genuine way, and offered stellar service. She even gave me a pastry at the end.   As far as the food and beverages go, it's extraordinarily pricey, but what I ordered didn't disappoint. Pork belly and Mac & cheese were flavorful and fresh. Their wine selection wasn't bad either.  However, the spoiler was Brian. If you're willing to get an attitude along with long waits, then go for it. As I said, you're stuck in an airport with nowhere else to go... just be forewarned.",

The southwest terminals are under construction and the C gate area specifically had nothing but a news shop and a no name pop-up bar in front of \"coming soon!\" barriers. So since I had about 2 plus hours to kill I walked down to the B gate area and stumbled upon Zinc Brasserie- nice big inviting bar & sit down restaurant plus a to go platform adjoined. The minute I sat down I was greeted & served. The $16 steak salad I ordered was excellent- fresh, filling and great! Assembled and cooked to perfection. The food at the restaurant takes a little bit to prepare so if one is in a rush, being in an airport, it will be disappointing if you are trying to rush, eat, leave. However the staff is very vocal about the timing- ie this is going to take about 20 minutes etc. This locale is raising the bar high for airport food & prep. Many are set up for super quick turnaround and fast casual dining experience- this means most plates are pre-prepped to be nuked, or quickly assembled from frozen ingredients to be served up super quick. If you have the time it's great! I'm actually looking forward to going back the next time I have to fly out of there...",

She was good, witty, very personable.  I only had time for a drink and I had the proseco.  it was good, light, fruity. Just what I wanted at the time.  The espresso martini looked good.  WIll have to try next time.  Second time was this afternoon, skipped lunch so i can try their warm dungeness crab crepe, which did not disappoint.  Very pretty, very tasty.  light by hearty. the peppercorns added some heat.  Lots of crab, mushrooms.  good portion for 1.  Will have again.  And now the service...got seated quickly, like the first time, by the requested electric outlet.  however the service by the booth was slooow.  There were a couple young servers who didn't seem to know what they're doing or what they're supposed to do.  just milling around.  had to flag one down for a drink as he served the person next to me.  Thank goodness a more experienced (i.e. older) server arrived and took charge.  after that, she was attentive and got my crepe out quickly. quick tip, sit by the bar, order the crab and any drink.  they're all good. update: server Michelle was great.  almost upsold me to get the beignets and the pudding.  Heart set on pudding which was very good.  have to love French food.  it's rich.  ambience is like an upscale bistro.  Tin ceilings and flat screens by the bar.",

I felt sick and got the attention of that female manager and I said \"I don't think that waiter knew you meant to send those fries back\" and before I could finish she yelled at me \"THOSE FRIES WERE FINE.\"  I didn't argue, I didn't finish my food, and we left.",

I am perfectly set with a protein bar, very happy with a Five Guys burger, and thrilled with Rick Bayless's place (thanks O'Hara!).

I had the pork belly appetizer and it was on par with Michelin star restaurants - perfectly braised, perfectly fatty, perfectly meaty with an unexpectedly delicious fig mostarda and a side of arugula for a sharp finish to a perfect bite. If this is the new way airport food is going, bring it on!",

And for the sandwiches on the lunch menu it was mentioned in the description on the menu. So, I'm sure if I had eaten here for lunch I would have seen this on the menu and requested that the cook leave off the mayo and it would have been fine. Unfortunately I ate here for breakfast and ordered the crossant sandwich and that did not mention mayonnaise in the description and I never would have thought that it would have it. Nobody likes mayo on their eggs. Do they? Gross. Even after scraping off the offensive condiment, the sandwich was still not very good. The crossant was dense and greasy, the eggs overcooked and rubbery, and the ham made the whole thing way too salty. I did not enjoy it at all. I know you should never had very high expectations at an airport but really this meal was pretty bad. On top of that, as others have mentioned, it was pretty pricey. When filling out my expense report for the trip, this was the most expensive meal I had the whole time!",

Tonight I had dinner and commandeered a table for about 2.5 hours. The waiter was friendly and accommodating. I had their burger with bacon blue cheese.  YUM! The burger was cooked perfect and the blue cheese was actually a very creamy sauce.

The Staff is courteous but the food does take a while I wouldn't recommend stopping at the restaurant if you don't have enough time.

I hung tough and ate all of it. My wife's omelette was likewise large and had big chunks of ham in it with creamy fromage. She loved it!  I was forced to take a bite for QC reasons and I concur.   Stop in when in Phoenix Sky Harbor.",

I had two pieces of crispy bacon, a spoonful of scrambled eggs, burnt croissant, and had to get a latte from down the hall because their machine was broken.  It was just a sad, sad, sad breakfast.  However the waiter was nice but that didn't make up for the bad breakfast.  Also, because the latte machine was broken I got to have an amazing latte just down the way.  Shame I forget the name!",

Not a cactus in sight, but we stepped on in as we were hungry and knew that peanuts and a soda on our flight would not be enough.  We just missed the breakfast hours. However, the lunch/dinner menu featured an omelet with French ham, gruyere cheese, and creme fraiche, plus potato straws. Perfect. A generous enough portion that DH and I were glad we shared. Along with coffee, the omelet was enough to tide us over until we arrived home.  Look forward to stopping here again in the future.",

Bartender recommended the burger, so after some reflection on the distance between mussells and ground beef, I decoded to give it a try.  My medium rare hamburger was medium well, but I tasted it and it was quite edible.  While I typically would return it, I did not have the energy.  It was flavorful, and the frites were good.  Zinc's is a rather quiet place at the end of the walkway, and maybe the mussels got held up in an airplane somewhere.  It was my first chance for mussels in an airport.   Maybe next time.

Tip: the classic breakfast with ham looks more worth it than with bacon  I was seated at a high countertop with outlets which is pretty convenient. I was not asked whether I'd prefer table or countertop.   When I ordered the classic breakfast for some reason the server assumed I wanted bacon. Instead of asking \"with bacon or ham?\" He just asked \"with bacon?\" Which would make sense if the bacon was more worth it and what more people ordered.   When I finished the meal my server was nowhere in sight. It took 15 minutes to get my check. When I got the check the server stood there waiting for me to pull out my card and handed me the card processor and told me to follow the instructions on the screen then left. All the instructions were was to add the tip and hand the processor back to the server. In this time the server left and didn't come back so I had to wait to get my receipt.... luckily I was not in a rush for my flight.   I'm just glad I was on a business trip. I guess that's how this place stays in business.",

Zinc is one of the fancier places to grab a bite in an airport: shiny wood furniture, decorations adorning the walls, and yes, the cuisine happens to be French too!

I got instead the breakfast croissant with bacon - decent, a bit petit, but definitely not worth the price.  My wife ordered the French Omelet - nice, fluffy omelet filed with ham and gruyere and topped with fried potato straws.  This dish was actually pretty good.  I've been watching you-tube videos of how Jacques Pepin makes French Omelets and the form and texture looks very similar to Zinc's.",

I expected better.  They have enough servers to do better. Management needs to be more present and observant. It took 25 minutes to get my order of fries and green beans. The server said '\"sorry the kitchen is really slow today.\" Had a flight to catch so asked we for it to go. The fries and green beans were cold when delivered. Also the green beans were very greasy. I won't go back for the food or service.",

Since none in my travel party had eaten, we walked in here for something small to eat before our flight. To our utter surprise the menu looked extremely appetizing. We all had breakfast items. I had the granola and they had egg dishes. The granola was yummy though a faster meal might be better if your in a hurry. It took me sometime to eat it all. It was a big bowl.     My friends Omelet was probably the best of all of our meals. The little bite I tried was nothing like you'd expect at an airport but fit the expectations you'd have at a french bistro.      If your in Terminal 4 for a layover and have time to eat, try this spot. I'm going to go to the one in Scottsdale and hope they are just as good. I'd love to eat the same food without having to fly our of town.",

I've been a server and have had this happen to my table- I know its awkward but if they have hair in their food you should do your best to turn around their experience, not avoid them. The hair thing happens. Customer service determines how things go from there. Took forever to get our check. Next time we'll make the walk to four peaks.",

Fries are like 7 bucks and I went for the flat iron steak which was cooked good but lacked in flavor.  As I'm writing this the waiter comes over to notify that I gave him too much money for a tip...

Corey H (13066) was our server (unfortunately).  I ordered a Jamison chilled, no ice. Well I'm not a liquor expert but I know what Jamison taste like. When Corey H brought me the drink it didn't not taste like a Jamison. When I asked Corey H if it was really Jamison he explained to me that it was chilled and watered down and kept going with that's why it tasted the way it did. I excused it. My friend ordered food and we got some beers. Well it took Corey time to check in on us. Which was disappointing as the bar was basically empty. So I let it go and I ordered another beer as I was disappointed in my order. I did order a shot of Jack chilled. When it came it did not look like a True jack shot. I tasted it and was not able to tell what it was. I then asked my friend who was with me to try it and see if it tasted like jack. Well my friend who has ran a bar. Worked in the bar industry for the past 10 year even agreed it wasn't Jack. At that point we're over it and ready to go and board our flight. We sat for about 10 minutes until I began playing with my credit card in my hand and another worker saw and went to grab Corey. At that time Corey brought us out bill. Even though I spent $48 and some change  on two water down shots and two bottle beers rounded my card up to the nearest dollar and was going to leave a cash tip. I signed my receipt and was going to give Corey an additional tip in cash. Corey walked up and took the receipt before I could get in my wallet as I was finishing my beer and announced loudly \"thank you for my dollar tip\" which I found to be rude and very unprofessional. Especially when I was about to give him cash. I have never been so embarrassed for someone more in my life. I would suggest going to a different restaurant/bar. Especially if Corey H (13066) is you're server. I think he need a different career as I had a cash tip but he decided to make excuses about the poor drinks and be rude about the card tip. I always round of my card and leave cash tips. Well due to his rudeness he didn't get the cash tip, I've never in my life had a server say something to that extreme... please train or hire better people when I'm paying $48 for 2 shots and 2 beers to have a little more class.",

I always like having the option of sitting down and eating in a comfy banquette setting as opposed to being shuttled through a cafeteria line then searching for an open space to sit and eat somewhere three terminals away...  The coffee tasted freshly pressed, the service was just attentive enough, and I definitely look forward to spending a meal here again!",

The ambience and service were both great and there were a ton of attractive items on the menu.  Tried a few menu items:  Pate (3.5 stars): This was fine; it ha a pretty light flavor and was dense.  It leaned a little much on the bologna side of the spectrum.  Gruyere Burger (4 stars): This burger was really good; thick patty, dense eggy homemade bun, and melted cheese with a hint of truffle.  The fries were okay as well.",

Great taste, though the bread seemed a little to big and fluffy, but the caramelized onions added a nice sweet touch. The fries were seasoned with spices and tarragon, and were accompanied with ketchup and some type of aioli. At $14 it was pricey, but isn't all airport food pricey?  I was just glad to get a decent lunch in an airport and this place delivered.",

    "text": "I would like to preface this review by stating I understand airport locations are never as good as their original. With that said, the Zinc airport location appears to strive for a lower bar then most. It started with the greeting, we walked up and hostess greeted us with a \"you're going to have to wait a minute.\"  No hello or welcome, just instructions to wait (not to mention the fact the restaurant was half empty). We figured, this is what comes with an airport location so no big deal but the greeting really set the tone for our terrible experience. The service level was consistently bad, highlighted by two exceptionally awful events. The first was when our food was dropped off.  It was literally dropped off. No opportunity to ask for anything else or anything. As soon as we had our food, we realized we needed a knife, but our waitress took off and was not to be found. We asked another waitress who said said she would get one. She didn't. Finally, our waitress came back and upon request, she promptly went to a dirty table next to us to get us knives. Disgusting. By this time we had realized our fries were cold which leads me to the second terrible event...  We asked the waitress for new fries, which she was quick to agree to. After about 15 minutes, a reminder that we were still waiting for our fries, and watching the manager yell at another waitress right in front of is, we finally got our fries. The fries redo literally took longer then our food originally took. Look, the point of the airport locations is to provide a good introduction to local restaurants for travelers, but the Zjnc location is doing the opposite. I have wanted to try the Scottsdale location for years, but after my experience at the airport I'm not sure I ever want to go back. The food was pretty good (albeit cold), but the service was so bad I don't have any desire to try a Zinc product at this point.",

Zinc has totally bucked this trend. It's like a real restaurant, guys. The food is excellent. The fries are crazy delicious and my burger came out perfectly. They have an extensive beer and wine selection as well, which is such a nice change from the typical house wine and nasty water beer typically found at airport restaurants. I'm just passing through Phoenix, so I doubt I will be able to enjoy Zinc again, but locals flying out should definitely hit it up.  Oh and bonus! Outlets for charging electronics are at all the tables!",

Needless to say, every single restaurant including the BA lounge were booked solid with a waiting period of 20-30 minutes or more.  Given that I had put my name down here prior of heading to the lounge I was seated quickly when I got back to the C gates.  Atmosphere: Nice big airport restaurant with gourmet food and drinks. I would say the place is reasonable priced considered the location.  Food: I have eaten here before several times and don't remember ever being disappointed.  During my visit today, I chose the cheese burger with fries for my main entree.  While I didn't care about the seasoned fries the hamburger was quite tasty and juicy.  Since I don't like arugula I switched it out to iceberg lettuce and I am glad I did.  The service was great, and the food was awesome.  Verdict: 5 stars  I'll be back. Enjoy and Bon Appetit.",

I ordered soup and salad (French onion soup + Iceberg salad). The bar tender asked me if I wanted to add steak, chicken or avocado to my salad and I said yes to the avocado. The dressing of the salad was AMAZING, and all the ingredients were fresh; the lettuce, tomatoes, hazelnuts (unexpected and delicious), bacon, blue cheese, etc. The soup took a little longer than expected but it was worth it cause the broth was flavorful, the onions had perfect consistency and they didn't use mozzarella cheese (common mistake) for the au gratin. Being an airport restaurant, I understand the prices are a little higher than usual, but at the same time, for an airport restaurant, it did have really good flavors. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll definitely come back here.",

It was marginally disappointing, so it was a good thing my colleague shared a $9.50 order of the House Frites, which were plentiful and crispy with a smoked paprika aioli and house ketchup for dipping (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2BoCOWu&s=28506fe73f442a37772867f15c700ec644b6b11eb45f958d43ca88103ddcb4ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2BoCOWu</a>). Even on an expense account, I still felt it was pricey for airport dining.  FOOD - 3 stars...just a bit much for a pre-flight meal AMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's the airport...duh SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty fast because they have to be TOTAL - 3 stars...if you really need fine French dining at the airport after security",

    "text": "Best airport food I have ever had. This place 100% deserves a higher rating. For reference, I've worked at James Beard award winning restaurants. I enjoy gourmet French bistros on special occasions. So, the bar was high.  The food here was prepared from whole real ingredients. I could see the sprigs of thyme, slices of garlic, ample shallots, and lots of slices of Parmesan. The presentation/plating was excellent for this price point. Decor was relatively good for an airport restaurant. And booths were comfortable. I was hungry so I got a lot of food.   I had the Caesar salad, it had lots of real sliced Parmesan (not the cheap kind) and the dressing was homemade and delicious. The chicken was well prepared, perfectly sliced for a salad, and not dry.   I also had them mussels. The broth was a traditional French white wine with shallots (no tomatoes here) and had a lot of flavor. You could tell they had sliced and added several real shallots, garlic, and thyme to the dish and it was made from scratch. There was a generous serving of mussels and they were well prepared (every shell open, no sand/threads, not overcooked). They came out in a cast iron pot. I appreciated this touch.   The French fries came well seasoned with 2 dipping sauces in little dishes - ketchup and aioli. My favorite combo. I appreciated this extra step. The preparation looked sophisticated & typical of a higher end bistro.   I sat in the corner away from the door. The decor felt more like a bistro than an airport. Very comfortable booths.   The waitress asked me how everything was and seemed genuinely interested, not like it was just a formality. The man (manager I think) who created me was pleasant and cheerful (not always the case in airports).   Overall, I'm surprised to be writing a review about an airport restaurant but it was that good. If this place was near my house, I'd eat here regularly.",

The mexican bar down the hall doesn't have liquor (shame). I sat here with my book as my 4 p.m. Friday flight to San Diego was delayed.  While I asked for a few wines that were out of stock, the clever bartender tried to sell me on their special wines. I tasted a few and chose the one I had never heard of.  Eventually, I settled on a double vodka soda (more bang for your buck) and ended the stay with a philosophical conversation about business. Was it really a double? Either they pour handsomely or I forgot to eat lunch.   Those around me were so lovely and nice. I really enjoyed the talk. This isn't just coming from one experience, either. This is from multiple pit stops on my way out of town. Consistently they have fantastic service at the bar.   Pro tip: The bar is open seating. Shuffle past the crowd as a single traveler and own that seat.",

Bar drinks, food, gluten-free dessert and coffee books for reading pleasure.   Anyways, the prices are great. Excellent menu with just enough choices. I couldn't resist the frites, but actually not hungry. So they packed me for the airplane. The chocolate brioche bread pudding was amazingly good.   Loved it!  Besides Zinc Brasserie being in the airport, they advertise two other restaurants around Phonenix. I highly recommend them: alone or with others.",

Mirrors in the bar, plush velvet, baroque wallpaper and the smell of bacon? Views are nothing to talk about and the seating is a bit cramped as it's an airport and ppl have carryons. The service was decent. The food was omg! It's a bit pricey as should be expected with airport food but it was actually really delicious. We had the burger, chicken sandwich and wait for it...the beignets! Now lunch was good but the beignets were to die for. Very literally died and went to French pastry heaven. Craving it now as I type about it! The lemon ricotta and blackberry coulis with the powered sugar omg seriously hoping my next flight out is delayed so I can indulge once again. Hats off to the chef.

I am a fairly light eater but found myself still hungry after my zinc croissant (even after including the offensive FOUR DOLLAR upcharge for a single tomato slice). My husband was still hungry after his omelette and so both of us foraged on the ample remainder of our kids' crepes. The crepes were not good, but we were still hungry. Way too strong cinnamon flavor and just a funky taste with the creme fraiche. Will I be back next time I'm wasting time in terminal four at Sky Harbor?

Four eggs supposedly and billed as coming with shoestring fries. It was 3 eggs at most, more likely 2 eggs with a couple of tablespoons of brown shoestrings that were garnish. Nothing else. Cost? $14 plus $3 for coffee. I know an airport meal is generally way overpriced, but this was out of line even for an airport.  Walk a bit and go to Barrio in the D gates.",

Normally I don't have enough time to sit down for this type of meal at an airport, and when I do I'm generally disappointed - but not this time.  I ordered a side salad and the Grilled Chicken Paillard.  The waiter commented it was their best item when I'd placed the order.   Service was solid, food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The salad was Ok but the entree was excellent! The chicken had a nice thin but tasty crust on it. It was moist and the sauce was solid. The green beans were a little too al dente for my liking but weren't bad.   I'd stop here again just for this dish.",

I decided to stop in and eat at the Zinc Brasserie.   The restaurant is quite upscale inside if you decide to opt for table seating instead of bar seating. There is a variety of drinks you can select from and food.   I ended up getting table seating next to the windows. It was a beautiful location and was able to see outside/center bar area.  The service was quite good. The waiter kept my water and soda full. He checked up on me every so-often considering how transient the restaurant is.  One of my biggest complaints about this restaurant is the pricing. I selected the French Ham and Gruyere Baguette. Note that their sandwiches also comes with Mayo, even though its not listed on their menu. The baguette is $14.00 and the soda was a few dollars as well. Once you include tip, the bill came out to $27.00. I wasn't too impressed with the food quality of the baguette. I felt like it was a baguette you could make at home with lunch meats, cheese, and a hot presser. The French Fries were a little too spicy and messy. Their French Fries had a red spice plastered all over.   I'd recommend looking at other food selections at the airport.",

I wasn't feeling particularly famished, so I just had a drink and the pate from the starters menu.  I have to say, it was quite good.  The pate could have been warmer (well, not super-cold at least), because it did not spread very well (read: at all).  The flavors more than made up for it, as did the quantity of accoutrements.   The drink (Petiller) was well made and refreshing.  The service was pretty good as well.  My waiter came by the table often enough where I never had to wait for anything, but not so frequent that it was intrusive.  I was able to get some work done, get some charge on my phone, and relax with some tasty French fare.  The prices are pretty steep, but given that it's in the airport, you would come to expect this.  Definitely not the fastest or least expensive option, but if you have the time and want treat yourself, this is the place to do it.",

I do think the kitchen can screw up sometimes too, like strangely pale and nasty chunks of ham in their otherwise great Gruyere omelette, but overall this place has very big burgers, unique french infused sandwiches, crispy fresh salads, and a solid kitchen.   I have had breakfast and lunch here a few times, and considering that fast food can run you $15 easily with lots of noise and maybe a standing position in the gate madness that is PHX. It's best to back off from the gates and retreat into the Zinc. It's actually a \"value\" so to speak when you consider the total package. The other option is the Barrio way down on the other end, but this place is actually a bit cheaper, and more eclectic European, especially if you wish for wine, beer, cocktails.  Grab a respite.",

The sandwich itself has about 3 slices of soft pork belly with a hint of sweet; I think is from the fig spread on the bread. Maybe 6 strands of wilted arugula on the sandwich. I washed it down with a room temp Stella because I was told the beer is as cold as it gets; bummer face :(. Not my best sandwich by all means. I was hoping to love this pork belly sandwich.  Last month I was there in the morning hours and wanted this pork belly sandwich but they don't serve it before lunch so I had their French toast; which was superb! The Stellas were ice cold before 11 am, go figure; it's 12 o clock somewhere! Don't judge me, lol.   So this place gets a 3 for inconsistency in beer temp and 17-18 dollar pork belly sandwich.   I noticed the people next to me eating some sort of crepe concoction that looked interesting, maybe next time I have a 1.5 layover in Phoenix I'll try that!",

Naturally before a flight so we were in a bit of a hurry, but our waiter certainly was not.  This place would be kind of nice. Like a nice restaurant in some suburban mall, but in an airport it feels weird, expensive, and unnecessary.  I'm really not interested in buying a 60 dollar bottle of wine and sitting around waiting for a flight on Spirit.   On the plus side the oatmeal was pretty tastey. More like a dessert than a meal though. Had about half a strawberry in it in all. Kind of the texture of rice pudding. And served not in a bowl but in some sort of odd challice. Tasty, small, boring.  I would say its a good metaphor for the whole place.",

Because of a delayed flight, I had some time to kill. It was 10am, and I was in the mood for a Bloody Mary.   I had a seat at the long table wrapped around the center bar. I was greeted by the friendliest bartender who made me and other patrons feel welcome. I know I'm relaxed when I'm in the mood to strike up a conversation with a stranger. That and the weather conditions in California were enough to elicit questions.  As usual, I requested an extra spicy Bloody Mary. The bartender upsold me on an extra shot of booze, which I couldn't refuse. Why not? The flavors and toppings of the Bloody Mary were so, so good. Every time I fly through this terminal of Sky Harbor, I'm definitely stopping by again for another round!",

But the $20 steak salad pictured here was abysmal.  Clearly made by morning staff and sitting in a cooler all day.  Wilted iceberg lettuce, a few bleu cheese crumbles and thinly sliced tasteless steak.  Oh yes, some green beans sliced to imperfection. The only saving grace; wish my name were Grace, was the overly friendly liquor pushing bartenders which makes sense as an overcompensation for the flaccid and forgettable food. As a biologist, I know that Zinc prevents the corrosion of iron but in this case, given its namesake, it also contributes to the erosion of good food. God bless the staff; and tip them well.",

    "text": "My wife and I had 1 1/2 hours before our Southwest flight. Lots of time for a relaxing nice French experience. And although the food was excellent, the service was awful. We ordered a wine and a cheese plate to start and a gourmet burger to split. It took 15 minutes to be greeted and have our order taken... And it wasn't busy. The cheese plate came with no crackers and a small serving of bread.... So we asked for more bread-- FOUR TIMES! A 2nd server came finally and said the bread would be right up... But it never appeared! The burger finally came but there was no mustard, mayo or salt/pepper and we COULDN'T GET CONDIMENTS. Now it was time to get in line for our boarding priority AND NO SERVER TO PAY. Of course there were servers standing around everywhere but not ours. We needed the check! Now! So I finally found the manager, asked for a credit for the uneaten cheese plate (he refused but gave us the stale bread that had been sitting there waiting to be served), we paid, no tip and ran to the gate. AVOID!!!",

    "text": "If you are familiar with the original in Scottsdale, don't bother.  Menu is similar, but that is where the similarity ends.  Corporate ownership has messed with a beautiful thing. Stopped here while delayed, and having been to the original Zinc Bistro dozens of times since it's opening decades ago, I was excited by the chance to experience the airport version. Uh, nope. Service was eh, with no real recognition of being in an airport (i.e., there might be time constraints).  Ordered the omelet, which was overcooked and puddled in a fair amount of \"lube\" from the grill...took me back to my Village Inn days!!  The real topper - I asked for bread (remembering the as-close-to-Paris-as-you-get-in-Phoenix version at the Bistro) and got the following: \"we don't have bread, but I can bring you some for $3\" - what?? Curiosity piqued, I received some \"grilled\" slices of \"baguette\" that the kitchen miraculously found, served with two foil packages of butter.  I get this is the airport, but if you're gonna use the name, at least get a little close - Barrio, Matt's and L'Orangerie don't seem to be having the same problem. I hope the payout for the corporate ownership was worth it, Matt and Terry!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in for a quick breakfast during our recent layover at the Phoenix Airport.  We've both eaten in lots of airports and expect a slight jack-up in prices over regular, on-street restaurants.  However, the prices in this restaurant are exorbitant--AND, the serving sizes are quite diminutive!  My husband ordered an omelet with shoe-string potatoes.  When the meal arrived, my husband looked at his plate and said to the waiter, \"I ordered potatoes with the omelet.\"  The waiter said (with what must be his poker-face), \"There they are, sir.\"  What was \"there\" was a slight sweep of whitish-looking strings set over the omelet--a paltry garnish topping an omelet which looked like something ordered from a kids' menu.  I had ordered a bowl of oatmeal with fruit.  The oatmeal was tasty; however, the fruit was -- again --  more like a garnish (a few slices of fruit set on top of the oatmeal) rather than a side-dish.  The only positives in the restaurant were the waiter's friendly attitude and the good coffee.  Thus, I would advise eating elsewhere while at the Phoenix Airport.",

Music and ambiance is awesome and above all staff is really genuinely friendly and efficient. My waitress Jessica was not too invasive and made me feel at ease after a hard day of traveling and gave a sincere (I hope) compliment on my watch! Small things that make a big difference and that customers do appreciate. I also got convinced into trying their chocolate bread which was to die for ...

(i.e., $22 for a salad and a beer, and I left the place almost as hungry as I arrived).  Service:  waiter was slow to arrive initially, then I had a 5 minute wait for a beer.  When the food came, it was wrong.  They quickly fixed it, and it was at that point I realized there was almost zero taste.  I went for the salt and pepper, and, of course, they are too pretentious to actually have that on the table, so I have to ask the waiter for it.  Five minutes and another \"I'm sorry\" later, I have salt and pepper.  I then witness the bartender spend 7 or 8 minutes trying to figure out which checks were open and which were closed so he could go home (it was 7:20) - all the while ignoring the two women who sat down.  Admittedly, he did look up once and say \"I know you're here, I'll be right with you\".  Seriously, make sure you cash out before pouring that drink - nobody at an airport bar is in any kind of hurry or anything.  Anyhow, I'd never go back based on my experience. Maybe they had an off night, but...",

I was there on St. Patricks day and by that evening there were only a few items left on the menu and the bartender did not seem apologetic about it. I ordered the short rib baguette and could not finish it because the taste was so bitter that it was disgusting on top of it the bartender never asked me about how my food was until after 20 minutes when I told him to take it away because it was unsalable. I had originally wanted the soup but they were out, then I asked for the crab cakes and they were out so I settled in that sandwich. The service was poor and I was disappointed since the restaurant was recently opened the expectation is that the food would be better to attract a clientele. Finally, when I ordered my drink they were out of limes, how does a bar run out of limes.?",

    "text": "Stopped at the Zinc Brasserie after walking all around the Phoenix airport looking for good food and somewhere to sit while I waited for my delayed flight. Pulled up the Yelp app to check the reviews and decided to give it a try since it was one of the few airport restaurants with positive five star reviews.  I ordered the grilled chicken palliard because of the great reviews.  I was not disappointed!  It was excellent!  The grilled chicken was crispy, tender and flavorful!  The green beans were crisp and delicious. What a treat especially since I thought I'd have to settle for a tasteless, unhealthy option.  My server, Ty was prompt, courteous and attentive!  If I ever get back here, I won't eat anywhere else!  Great food, service and atmosphere!",

I'm not surprised at the extreme cost since it's at the airport, but for that kind of money you would not expect the waiter to be lame.   This dude was was grouchy, never smiled and was not friendly at all.  In fact, when he swiped my credit card and he forced me to put a tip into his machine (which I gave him a nice one), he handed me my receipt and walked away. He didn't say thank you, he didn't say have a great day, he didn't say a damn word.  Myself and my buddy who is a pilot, and was dressed as such, looked at each other in a strange way.  If you get back to me I have his name and I'm happy to supply it to management. It's waiters like this which cause patrons like me not to want to tip and the waitstaff suffers.  Good luck with your business. I'm going to Burger King next time.",

    "text": "On our way out of Phoenix a couple months ago we stopped in here and ate before our flight.  The service was really good and our waitress was very attentive. The food was decent, but not anything overwhelming and it took a bit of time to get, so if you are in a hurry for your flight, you may want to skip the sit down part of this place and just get something from the grab-and-go area.    The overall feel was fun and the people watching was definitely entertaining! The seats were okay, but tightly spaced, so finding somewhere to put our carry on luggage while we ate was difficult, and became more difficult when they sat people on both sides of us despite there being other available seats. The luggage ended up under our table and we were scrunched for foot space.    Our waitress was really the best part of the whole experience.  She was quick and really nice.  She chatted with us for a few seconds every time she stopped at our table and made us feel welcome.  Overall: Not a bad place to grab a bite if you have a little time to kill before a flight. If you are in a hurry - get something from the grab and go case.",

Selection was a little better than average for an airport. The service was good, not above average. The bartender told me to go with the mac and cheese, in which i did because he said it was the best option. He was wrong. The uncured ham in the mac and cheese was phenomenal, but that was definitely the only highlight of that dish. I was not pleased with it and due to that i will not be eating here again. As for drinks if the other alcohol serving establishments are busy then I will definitely give this a try again. I don't like to be to harsh from one experience, unless the overall experience was awful.",

He was very gluten free aware and helped me navigate to the steak salad with the mustard champagne, instead of blue cheese dressing.   I enjoyed a couple of 11.00 house glasses of wine while I charged my phone and ate. There are chargers all around the restaurant, pretty much at every table, which was awesome. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce can only be so appetizing. The steak and dressing were tasty, it wasn't till I was almost done with the salad that I realized they hadn't put the crumbled blue cheese on it. Apparently they assumed if I couldn't have the dressing the cheese itself was also off limits. They brought me a little and I enjoyed it with the remainder of my salad.  Salad was a good portion and about 16.00. Overall portions were good on both wine and food. Service good and very prompt. Price expensive, but hey, it's airport food.   Atmosphere is nice with comfortable booths, high top tables and a bar with tv. Also lovely windows overlooking the runway. I'd certainly stop in here again on another layover.",

I broke the cardinal rule by eating them last. They got cold and squishy quick! Not much crunch, but loved the aoili dipping sauce. The pork belly sandwich was okay. The fig jam paired with green apple, little pieces of arugula gave it a nice sweet savory balance. I was a little indifferent about the bread. On one hand it was stable and didn't get soggy with all the sauce and junk..... Then it got to a point where it was just too much to handle. I started taking the contents out of my sandwich and ate it piece by piece.  My waitress was great and even made a comment 'bout the picture of my husband and I on my debit card. Kudos for that ;)  Otherwise.... I thought the food was mediocre for the price.",

We had a few rounds, my wife wines and myself across the board which I love to do. Local beers, imports and great drinks were all amazing.  We finally decided what we wanted to eat and our order was taken, our food came out quickly and was perfect. Both of us got the Flat Iron Steak, awesome for airport standards and up there with a good restaurant which you would go to for dinner around town.  The steaks were done to request, Medium Rare and Pittsburgh/Black & Blue style. Tender, juicy and filling.  We asked for our check and it was actually lower than we had planned on which was a pleasant surprise. A very reasonable dinner while we waited.  Go here and bypass the other restaurants as the service and promptness alone make it worth your time.",

While I loved the food, the portions were tiny and the price was $$$.  I ordered the Classic Breakfast ($13) which was 2 small eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and a croissant the size of a baseball.  The kitchen was unable to poach eggs so I settled for over medium.  The Boy ordered The Zinc Omelet ($15.50) which was good, but again not worth the price.  The dining area was not open when we got there (bar seating only for the 1st hour) and the bartender was so so.  The Boy needed his golf fix and asked him to turn the TV to the Open.  The bartender was happy to oblige, but The Legend of Bagger Vance movie was on The Golf Channel instead of Open Coverage.  The Boy asked him again if he could change to the correct channel but the bartender didn't seem to care so we spent the rest of our time at the bar ignoring The Legend of Bagger Vance.  Before you jump all over me, I get it, it's the airport, stuff is going to be more expensive.  What you don't want is to pay $60 for breakfast and then go to another restaurant to order more food and drinks because you are still hungry, which is what we did.",

Solid bartenders good service, but the worst $17 sandwich I've ever eaten. I was in a hurry &  ate the chicken & Avo, took off the thick & way too hard panini grilled bread roll (not a good choice). The fresh green beans were delicious, I enjoyed most of those. I did ask the waitress if i should have been able to see the shiitake mushrooms & brie that were listed in the menu.  She said 'yes', they definitely forgot them. I only added avo but had not removed anything when I ordered. The waitress looked over evidence( the bun) and it was obvious there were none. She offered me a complimentary dessert, I declined. & then complimentary drink, I graciously declined as I needed to get to my gate to catch my flight.  I appreciated her effort, i hadn't complained, until it dawned on me that it wasn't a good sandwich. The service was thankfully very good, 'my' sandwich, the absolute worst $17 sandwich to date. But hoping yours will be better, its always nice to find delicious food during the long hours involved in airline travel. But I do recommend the Service & cold beer.",
