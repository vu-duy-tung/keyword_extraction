The food was a little better than most Chinese food in this price range outside of china town in any city USA. I had the moo shu vegetables and the pancakes tasted like they were freshly made, not the usual thin hard ones you get with take out.  Over all food was tasty and not greasy. The outside does look a little creepy, even my 12 year old commented on how unfriendly the door is. Well, maybe they are screening their clients.   If I was a local I would make this one if my regular casual dining  spots.",

The menu does not state this, but the dish has little carrot cubes and peas, which added some variety that I have not seen in eggplant dishes at other Asian restaurants. I would say this is one of the better versions of eggplant I have had, though I wish they had brown rice.              The only problem that came up was that our order was mixed up with someone else's order at the cash register. So we paid for someone else's dinner and then had to void the transaction and repay. Also, it was about 8 PM when we came for pick up and the place was void of employees, so we stood around for a few minutes waiting for someone to help us.  In short, I would go back just for this dish, but otherwise, there isn't much else on the menu that is interesting to me.",

I realize that what I like has been Americanized, but it's comfort food to me. This place was deserted at around 5:45 PM. Only one couple were seated, but a number of people came in to collect takeout food. This place isn't fancy but it is homey. And I enjoyed the music they were playing - basically pop music from the 1940's and 1950's. Big band type stuff with singers like Sinatra and Ray Charles. Although I wanted garlic pork or chicken, the menu was somewhat limited so I went with the kung pao chicken combination dinner. It included hot and sour soup, noodles, an eggroll, a crab puff, and steamed rice The soup was perfect with a great rice vinegar kick. Although I never order Chinese noodles, these were so great I ate them before getting into the kung pao chicken. The king pao was unlike any that I had ever had because the meat and vegetables were sliced instead of cubed. The flavors were spot on with just the right heat level. The eggroll was good but could have been crisper. All in all a very enjoyable meal and more food than I could eat.   Share review       Edit review       Delete review",

Had lunch here with my daughter and all the other reviewers are right--Swani is super nice and the service is friendly.   A pet peeve of mine involves Mongolian beef pieces that are too large for a single bite, and yet most Chinese restaurants only provide a plastic fork and no knife. Grrrrrrrr! The beef here was actually cut in bite sized pieces and they have REAL silverware, including a knife (didn't need it though). There are tables and chairs, one large table for larger groups, and a reasonably clean fish tank. Yep, you can be sure that your fish is indeed fresh.  I definitely recommend this place.",

I don't know, maybe Aunt Flo was coming to town - who knows.  That said America, this place was soooo not up to its 4-star rating...no sir.   I got back to my hotel, got my bed reDy to assume the psuedo \"dining in, in my hotel\" position (life on the road can be so mundane by comforting too). Anywho, I started to open up my two orders and bam...right out of the gate the first dinner was completely wrong. Instead of the spicy shrimp, it was some chicken concoction, however, it was loaded with veggies and some jalapenos - cool right?  Negative ghost rider...it tasted like a shoe. :(  Then I figured, well, I'll just eat my fried rice. Fingers crossed, I opened up the second little container and bam...again!  Nope, not \"bam\" in a good way...no ah ah...nope...nada.  It was Fried rice yes, but it was a light grey in colour, and yep...you guessed it, this too had an odd smell. This little lovely however smelled like my drawers after a week of hunting. And America, that ain't nothing I'm proud of.    Well, I ended up having two cliff bars for dinner. I'll let you draw your own conclusion folks...I eat a lot of Asian food, especially on the road.  Still not sure why that is...anyway, I'd point you towards another place if I were to be totally honest with y'all. Sorry...the lady that took my order was very sweet, the place was cosy and definitely didn't lack character.  That said, character, cosy and kind people don't fulfill a Chinese food jones. :(",

My usual order is a General Tso's Chicken dinner combination which comes with fried rice, noodles, soup, crab puffs, egg roll, and the entree itself. The meat is good quality (I hate going to a Chinese restaurant and getting that gross chewy chicken).   They are also willing to make things that aren't actually listed on the menu such as Orange Beef or Orange Tofu. Which brings me to my next point, if you are a vegetarian you can pretty much get any of the meat dishes with tofu.",

Swanee (the owner) is the nicest, friendliest person in the world and will make you feel like you're welcome instantly. And the food is AMAZING. I come here pretty much every week (or even more often) with my girlfriend and sometimes other friends and roommates. My favorite is the Sriracha chicken - try it if you like a little bit of spice. The $5 Sake Bombs are worth every penny. You get 4 of them so it goes a long way, for an already incredible price. The atmosphere is very relaxing too, great little spot to grab food and drinks, not too flashy but not too casual. Come with friends, family, or strangers- you're going to have a wonderful time!",

The other night, craving Chinese food, we thought we'd give them another shot.  We hoped they had learned something about cooking Chinese food over the last eight years, but unfortunately for us, they have not.  The hot and sour soup was all sour and no hot and just tasted bad.  The chow mein was made with super thick gummy  noodles, flavorless sauce and one slice of carrot.  The orange chicken was at least edible but was over-breaded and in a sauce that tasted like it was out of a jar.  And there was a False bottom of shredded cabbage in the orange chicken container just to take up space.  And what's with the decor?  Its like dining in the middle of a garage sale.",

Even on that standard, i give it a 1 out of 5.  service wise: the 5 of us were from out of town for a conference after which we thought we could have some snack food w/ beer back in hotel. therefore, we paid this place a visit. One of my friends is vegetarian so we ordered egg roll for him. we ordered 3 from appetizer menu and one dish. that takes them 30 minutes to make. Then before i left with my takeout, i checked the bag and there were only 2 pairs of chopsticks! I told the woman (mid-age) there we have 5 ppl. and she gave me 2 more pairs. I asked her for one more pair and she said to me \"you don't need chopsticks to eat egg roll,\" in referring to my vegetarian friend. Out of disgust, i asked her \"does one extra pair gonna cost you anything?\" and she replied w/ her high pitch voice, \"everything costs money!\"   I have never been to a restaurant which would argue w/ customers over a pair of chop stick.",

The lady behind the counter was very nice.  She offered me water while I waited for my take out.  I didn't have to wait long.  I ordered chicken fried rice, orange chicken and crab puffs.  The crab puffs were a bit on the skimpy side, but tasted good.  The fried rice was a little dry and the orange chicken was cooked well.

It's all good, but those are my favorites.  The Staff, not bad to look at.  Attentative and efficient.  The owners are fabulous.  They've been around Tempe at this and their other location since 1976, when I first got to the Valley.  I've tried other Chinese restaurants in Tempe, but they are just the best, all the way around.  I like the new improvements they made in their dining room flooring, walls and seating.  Makes it more open and bright in the dining room.  I just want them to add a bar, so I can go have a cocktail and watch a game without leaving the neighborhood.",

I had read reviews about the owner being really sweet too and she was there and thanked us for our business.  The food was delicious and I like the way they bread their chicken.  It's not that thick breading most Chinese restaurants use for Orange chicken, General tso's chicken, etc.  It was more like the sweet and sour chicken breading.  My fiance also said the food had really good flavor.  See you soon Little Szechuan!",

Service was bad (took like 10 minutes to be seated when the restaurant was empty, took 15 mins for drink orders, another 5 mins to get the drinks keep in mind that the restaurant was empty, 20 mins for our food to come out, drinks refilled once in the 2 hours we were in the restaurant). All around bad, I have no idea how this restaurant is 4 star rated. Only positive was that there were big portions, but the food was bad so you wouldn't want the big portions.",

Their place looks dirty and very disorganized, and that was just from the start. Then they sat us down and took FOREVER to take our order! We had to call a server over because they wouldn't come to us. I ordered the orange chicken dinner combo that came with side of egg drop soup, egg roll, crab puffs, and chow mein. The food was absolutely horrible! Super greasy and has zero taste, nothing that i got with my combo was good! I don't know why this place has 4 stars because it doesn't deserve them. It really deserves to be shut down for their shi*ty service and food!",

If you want really good Chinese served by a Husband and wife who have been doing it for years come here.   Got to meet the  Owner his wife and his Son all working there.   Live supporting these types of business.",

The chow mien was very tasty. The noodles were cooked very nice and they had very nice flavor. I also had the orange chicken which wasn't as tangy as other places which I liked. The fried rice was ok, I personally like it with a little veggies but this one is just plain rice. The flavor was just ok. They do have coke products which was awesome. I think I would come back for lunch again the price was decent and for the size of the plates I would recommend this place.",

We had the house special chicken, kung pao chicken, and the dan dan noodles. The meat was very tender and the rice was delicious. However, the pepper was a bit too excessive for my taste.  Basically, only go here if you are ok with waiting 2 to 3 hours for decent food.",

This little place is located directly across from Oreganos so the next time you find yourself waiting in an endless line there, look across the street and you'll find some delicious Chinese food!  We found this place after attempting to go to Oreganos and were delightfully surprised. It is a stand-alone restaurant--not part of a strip mall.  The decor is tacky and gaudy, but there is a warmth there because the family who owns and operates the place makes you feel welcome from the start.  The food was very good. I had the moo shu pork and my son had chicken lo mein. The lo mein noodles are homemade and are thick! The moo shu was well done and the owner hand wrapped them for me herself. We also had the BoBo platter which is their version of PuPu and it was the typical fare but just seemed more fresh tasting. Everything was served piping hot which as we all know is a rarity in restaurants these days. Everything was flavorful and delicious.   The service was excellent. The owner is sweet and kind and her son is the cook. They did great work and the next time I go to Gammage, I'm making a point to hit up Little Szechuan for our meal!",

    "text": "I truly have tried to allow for room for improvement at this place because honestly the woman who must own this place is as sweet as can be.  I think her sons help run it at times and they are really nice too. BUT... personality does not a good Chinese restaurant make.  After various visits over the course of a year and a half, I find it hard to offer more than 2 stars.  My last visit sealed it for me as I was ridiculed by my friend whom I had earlier convinced to partake of Lil Szechuan's offerings. I have been banned from restaurant selection within the group as a result of my attempt to find more good than not here.    One thing I get here is the brown rice.  It is not really brown rice. It is white rice made to look brown by adding soy sauce.  It is good as a house special.  One of my girlfriends always gets the mu schu and swears its the best ever...I swear that she does not eat out much!  If you like won ton soup this one is just average...just nothing special at all about it. Yesterday, my friend ordered cashew shrimp in a \"delicate white sauce\". \"The sum of its parts are not worth more\", he murmured and tried to shovel a \"no thank you portion\" into his mouth while politely reminding me with his eyes that I had committed an epic fail.   Banished from my throne and unable to select food options for at least a month ( my own personal hell), I must bring a few more things up that need to be addressed here.  Never have a menu where its possible that the first three items that a person may ask for are \"no longer available\".  I ask that you always have coffee and tea available even if it is not immediately ready.  And don't play a squeaky radio with fuzzy reception from a back room against a competing television as diners are  baffling over their other senses of sight and smell.  So sorry. I need Tott's Asian Diner back FAST!!!!",

We came about 2:15 and they were closing for a bit at 2:30 so I felt bad. The waiter was nice and friendly and prompt (for the most part) so that was assuring. Everything made my mouth water.  We walked here from College & University so it was a bit of a trek. I felt the staff (or the ones I encountered) were occupied since they were beginning to close. We were the only ones there due to the time and at one point - locked in. But hey, if I feel like making the trek again, I'll go back.",

The dumpling serving is meager relative to what they charge, and the hot/sour soup has no pork or chicken - then adding it is as an extra was crazy expensive!  They also don't have what other Chinese places call a \"diet menu\" - essentially normal entree options that you can have steamed rather than stir-fried with sauce on the side and brown rice. Not only isn't there a specific menu option for this, they declined to prepare a basic chicken with mixed vegetables for me in this way. Just \"no\" - even though the restaurant was basically empty and the kitchen was slow. Plus no brown rice.  Breaks my heart - I so want to like them -",

Please note I am spelling Sichuan Correctly using Pin Yin.  This place's food does not even remotely taste like Sichuan Food.  The appearance does not look like Sichuan Food, and the Smell is nothing like Sichuan food.  I asked them in Chinese if they could make my food Ma-La, which is numbingly hot.  I did not ask for La si ren (kill people hot).  Just if they do make Sichuan Food they would be able to do this.  OK, they could not do and I appreciate the honesty of their telling me.  I ordered Chicken Eggplant.  Nothing to it, not prepared correctly and the chicken was stringy and dry.  Yum YUm!!! OK I did not get sick + 10 hours from lunch.  Now I ordered some dumplings.  Well I took one bite and did not eat another.  The meat tasted strange and I thought someone has put soap in my mouth.  I have eaten dumplings in China all over the place, in USA and I have to say, those where .....no good.  When they would not give me my money back for the dumplings (cold, late, and soapy) i decided next time I'd go to the culture center...  For people to say Authentic etc. I'd just say, Sorry you don't know what you are talking about. More authentic than fast food places?  They do have Chinese Fast food places in China too.  Fast Food Hong Kong tastes like fast food Chinese in USA.    Go to the Chinese cultural center on the 40's block in Phoenix if you want anything even close to Sichuan.  I know some people will have issue with me on all this.  that is OK. You won't die here as far as I know, but clearly they are not even Little Szechuan.  yi dien dien Sichuan  (little little) Sichuan.",

If you are looking for more Americanized style and are unwilling to give a small local owned business then there is a PF Changs at Mill and Uni.",

    "text": "I had greater hopes for Little Szechuan over the nearby Mr. Hunan as the latter is simply a carry out joint. However, despite the nice colorful dining room, the food at Little Szechuan was fairly bland. I suppose theoretically these two Chinese joints specialize in the regional cuisine of their names, but there is little difference in menu or taste.   One thing I will say is that my waitress was extraordinarily nice at Little Szechuan. I was studying Arabic at the time and we had a really friendly, fun conversation about language. She helped make an incredibly dull meal an actually rewarding experience.",

The service is great--the business is local, family-owned and the owners are gracious and friendly.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is yummy.  What more could you ask for?  I am a vegetarian and I have eaten just about everything vegetarian on the menu.  They have several tofu dishes that I enjoy--try the Kung Pao Tofu or Spicy Tofu if you like hot.  The Moo Shu tofu is also a delicious dish if you aren't into spicy.  For extra spice, the owner makes a very tasty hot chile sauce from scratch.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the sauce!  Give Little Szechuan a try--you won't be sorry!",

    "text": "I only started going to Little Szechuan about 4 months ago, I was working at a building about 5-10 minutes away near mill and rio salado. I refused to eat at the little cafe they had inside the building, and I didn't feel like paying 12 bucks for a salad and/or sandwich.   My friend recommended this restaurant and I was a bit sketchy at first, but when I got in there, the feel of the place is so homey. It's family run so the staff is incredibly nice and oh so attentive.   By no means does the food wow me by being ultra-delicious, but it isnt bad either. The egg drop soup is amazing probably the best I have ever had so far!   I usually order the lemon chicken or if it is a cold day or when it rains, I usually just have some crab puffs and a large egg drop soup to split with a friend. It's also pretty inexpensive!   I love this place, I have been back numerous times since i've first gone, and I will continue to come back because the service is amazing.   As far as people's negatives comments, everyone has their fare share of opinions, and sometimes the restaurant may be having an off day....   That won't change my opinion though, I just wish I worked closer...",

I checked Yelp and saw the reviews for this place were decent.   When we walked in the hostess/owner was very nice. The decor a little dumpy and the lighting bright so far from romantic or cozy.   Tsingtao beer was nice and cold. We were starving so ordered a combo appetizer. Pretty good but not great.  Than had a couple entrees.    Kung pao beef was brutally bad. Inedible. Shrimp in lobster sauce was decent.  A little bland but the ingredients fresh and the shrimp quality.    Overall if your in the area and craving Chinese I would give it a shot. Owner operated.  Lots of locals so maybe it's the only game in town and they know what to order.    From what I hear if Mucho Gusto is open across the street (Mexican), skip this place.  The Thai food place across the street is supposed to be good too.",

Staff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit.",

My girlfriend's family is a chore to go out and eat with, and my food allergies tend to compound this complexity even further. Her mom and dad have recently gone Vegan, she's a vegetarian, and I can't eat chicken or fish due to some pretty industrial allergies.  So most places just aren't options for us to all go out to eat. One of us will always slight the deal, making it so we can go get water as a group.  But Little Szechuan takes care of all of our various and complex dietary needs like champions. The food is delicious, the service is funny and gets the job done, and the decor is vintage 1970's Jewish Christmas.   If you want a great meal, and you like to eat as a group, drive out to Tempe and make it happen. Keep local business alive instead of going to a chain!",

    "text": "I stopped by Little Szechuan today for lunch with a coworker. I told him the food was okay, nothing spectacular or memorable. The food is so-so and we needed to kill half an hour. So we decided to eat here rather than Chili's down the street since he had never been here before.  I've been here about a dozen times over about 5 years. It isn't the first place I think of when I want Asian food, but it is close to ASU and the price is right for lunch.  Did I mention that the food was not memorable? Today I had a dish I won't soon forget for its insipidness and service that was downright abysmal.   Usually I stick with something straightforward here like Beef and Broccoli or Chicken and Vegetables. I thought I would try something different after hearing the person next to us order Garlic Chicken. I frequently order Garlic Chicken from Mr. Hunan down the street. But for some reason, I didn't think to go there today.  I usually order it as a take away from Mr. Hunan.   My partner ordered Teriyaki Chicken, of all things. When our dishes arrived, the chicken was generous on both dishes, but it was prepared in the same manner for both dishes. It was thickly breaded and deep fried chunks. His chicken was piled high but was bone dry. There was a ramekin of teriyaki sauce next to the chicken. The ramekin was half filled with teriyaki sauce--not enough to fully cover the chicken if poured over the chicken and not enough sauce to dip every piece of chicken. There were no vegetables, pineapple or anything else I tend to associate with Teriyaki Chicken. The plate had chunks of fried chicken, teriyaki sauce on the side and a pile of fried rice.   My pile of Garlic Chicken was the same breaded and fried chicken. Most of the chicken was coated with the garlic sauce and onions that was part of the dish. Some of the chicken was again bone dry. It was obvious that the chicken had been cooked separately from the onions and sauce. The sauce and onions were poured over the chicken rather than mixing the chicken, onions and sauce together in a wok.  And when I say onions and sauce, it is no exaggeration. The garlic sauce consisted of sliced white onions and 2-inch lengths of green onion. I took one bite of the chicken and it was crunchy and salty. It was the only bite I took of the dish. I lifted some of the chicken and onions to see how much sauce there was and the plate was visible beneath the chicken. There wasn't enough sauce to even give a thin coat on the plate. I pushed the plate away and sat there drinking hot tea while my partner finished his dish.  The waiter walked by our table at least 4 times and saw that I had pushed the dish to the edge of the table to be cleared away, but he didn't stop to ask if anything was wrong. In fact, he took a detour on one of the visits to the table behind us--it looked like he was trying to steer clear of our table. I purposely didn't flag him down. I wanted to see if he would stop by and check with our table, but he never did.  When my partner finished, we sat for a while at the table, but eventually we had to walk up to the counter to get our bill--not the usual practice here. They bring the bill along with a fortune cookie. We stood at the counter for a while and the waiter finally showed up to ring us up. He told me the total, but I told him I was not paying for my dish since I thought it was horrid. He took the charge off the bill without question. I did not leave a tip and we left.   I will go back to this place. Probably for my usual once a year visit. And I will order my usual nondescript meal. If you want Chinese food near ASU, you are pretty limited on choices.   Again, we should have gone to Mr. Hunan, but I never think of Mr. Hunan as a place to sit and eat. Their Garlic Chicken is really tasty. It has thin slices of tender chicken with a good mix of vegetables including  onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, broccoli, and carrots. Their sauce is delicious. There is plenty of the brown sauce to drizzle over the rice and I find the rice and sauce combination to be as good a treat as eating the chicken and vegetables.",

They had a vast beer selection which the boyfriend LOVED. His  beer was ice cold just the way he likes it.  We ordered. We first got our soups. Mine was pretty good. He liked his. That is where things hit the fan. The eggrolls were satisfactory. I make better ones.  Secondly, the crab puffs which I asked intially if they used any or fake crab  they said- No just cream cheese which I thought was great until I cracked it open. Had FAKE crab, which will end me up in Tempe St. Lukes quicker than  Tempe PD arresting an underage drinker. Then our dishes arrived already hungry from the teaser of a soup. I got the beef and broccoli that was tough. My boyfriend got the orange beef which I thought was significantly better... even cold.  So over all everything minus the crab puff incident.  It was a 4 star place. But that definitely knocked it down a notch, and it would of been lower if I actually ate it.",

I have heard good things about this place but was surprised to see such negative reviews on Yelp. It seems, though, that people review based on the most amazing Chinese they've ever had and tend to get snobbish about it... I love Chinese food but I am certainly not an expert on places in the area so we decided to give this place a try anyway. I'm glad we did.   The lady who took my order on the phone was very nice and courteous and seemed very warm when she greeted us in the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein and my boyfriend ordered the Sun Devil Spicy Chicken. I am always weary about ordering chicken dishes from chinese restaurants because sometimes the chicken can be just weird and disgusting but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the chicken tasted in the Chow Mein. The noodles were really thick, which is just the way I like them to be and the sauce tasted awesome as well. My boyfriend really liked his dish and was satisfied with how spicy it was... usually he orders a spicy dish and it is no where close to being spicy.  Although we did not dine in the restaurant, we thought it looked cute and cozy, even though it looked a bit outdated. I'd like to see what it's like to dine in next time... and I will definitely be ordering carry-out again!",

Wish their lunch hour would extend til 3:30 like most Chinese places. And its americanized Chinese. If you want authentic, go to the Chinese cultural center.",

I wanted to crawl inside of it, camp for three days and eat my way out like a tarantula wasp larva, but I had work....  It goes without saying, but the service is incredible.  Everyone mentions it.  The lady who works there gave me soup on the house simply because my girlfriend ordered a meal with it and I didn't and didn't want me to be lonely and without something to eat.  That's rad.  As I was leaving she also gave us free cookies.  Fuck yeah!  Each time I've been here, there've been loud-as-hell people for some reason.  One time I went and there must've been, a World of Warcraft convention in town or something because there was a table full of kids with plastic battleaxes telling jokes with such punchlines as, \"Wookie bowcaster,\" and \"Purple light sabers!\"",

    "text": "So, before heading out to Phoenix Zoo Zoolights, we figured we go eat dinner and usually that means Thai food.  But out of nowhere I had an idea to eat something else.  We narrowed it down to Chinese but not the usual places that I like or he likes.  We wanted to try something new, a little adventure in our relationship, lol.  I don't know how we decided on this place (searched Google) but we usually stay away from places close to ASU because sometimes reviews are from students who probably thinks anything above ramen noodles is a 5 star.  No offense, I've been there.  But off we went.  First off, I like the place once inside.  Asian lamps hanging, big mural masterpieces of Asian scenery.  Most tables have lazy susans which ahhh home.  The waitress/owner was great.  She was lively, funny, engaging and overall nice.  Before I get to the food, we noticed that alot of older people (meaning over 30, like me) came in and they all seemed to know the waitress/owner so we thought this place must be great if local patrons are coming in by the numbers.  Everything that we ordered was pretty good.  But I really loved my friends' dish which was the House Special Chicken.  When I go back I will def get that.  Yummy!    And to top it all off, the waitress/owner gave us a wrapped gift saying thank you for coming.  Wha-what?  A box of cookies for a gift!  Ginger cookies and they were good.",

    "text": "Even though I'm Chinese American, I'm not that bad of a \"Chinese Food\" snob.  I've eaten my share of \"bad\" Chinese Food at buffets, cafeterias, and even the garbage I try to make at home.  Sometimes, eating out is all about \"MPD\" -- Mass Per Dollar -- where can I fill my belly the most by paying the least.  Little Szechuan is the closet neighborhood Chinese restaurant, however I've been too scared to eat here.  Why?  From the outside, it looks like a porn shop.  (Can I say that here?)  It is a freestanding nondescript white brick building with all the windows blacked out, and no menu posted at the door.   I like to look thru the windows before entering a place, so I at least know what I'm getting myself into.  The only identifying thing about the outside of the restaurant is their sign.  They just installed a new sign, which looks exactly like the old sign, but different color.  But both signs exclaimed, \"Open since 1976.\"  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Most Chinese restaurants are family owned and operated, with high staff turnover rates.  If you have a successful restaurant, you may move on to Bigger and Better things, fix up your old place, or sell your business to someone else.  Is this porn shop Chinese Restaurant circa 1970s some hidden Tempe gem of an institution?  And what does it mean that only one other Yelper has reviewed this restaurant in its 30 year history?  I finally convinced a friend to go with me.  He told me to get used to the porn shop aesthetics, because there are plenty of other places in AZ that look like this.  Its not about privacy, he assured me, its about that gosh darn summer Sun.   Thus, I was comforted with the inside of the building, because it had the look and feel of the Chinese Restaurants I know and love  in the SF Bay Area.  1970s wood paneled walls, \"Orientalized\" promotional knicknacks from Bud or Tsingtao, and other Asian artwork.  I chatted with the friendly server, who informed me that she moved to AZ from China to attend ASU in the early 1970s, and eventually opened the restaurant after graduating.  Indeed, there was history in this restaurant and on the walls.  The menu had a lot of choices, including lunch specials.  Did we find a hidden gem?  Our first dish, Mu Shu Vegetables were great, so we remained hopeful for our main dishes.  Then, our hopes were dashed.  The Hunan Beef was spicy (actually, too spicy for me, but I'm a wimp), but the sauce had a weird texture, flavor, and color.  Their House Special Chow Mein was very unspecial, and I forgot what was wrong with the homemade dumplings.  Needless to say, I did not finish my dinner nor did I bring leftovers home.  What a rollercoaster! --Looks bad from outside --Looks nicer inside --Food terrible --Service nice and friendly.  The restaurant seems to have regular customers, and I applaud them.  Maybe the restaurant makes some other dishes really great, or they like the ambiance, or whatever.  I may try one of their lunch rice plates someday if I'm desperate, but alas, I'm still hunting for the best hole-in-the-wall Tempe Chinese Restaurant.",

(They used to be eat in/take out only, now they deliver)  They started posting tons of new pics, changed their menu layout completely, lots of traditional items gone, and worst of all the food changed. When I ordered from here two years ago I could TELL that everything was made by hand. And now everything looks like it was straight from a package. Fried rice looked IDENTICAL to panda, and teriyaki chicken tasted terrible, way too greasy and no flavor. I won't be ordering from them anymore. If I wanted Panda Express, I would just go there. I'm super bummed because I used to feel the love in their food; now it's sterile and there's nothing interesting or tasty about it. Go back to home made Chinese and I'll be back",

Most of us opted for the dinner combo, which gives you some appetizers (wontons and an eggroll) as well as an entree. I got the sweet and sour shrimp which came with a TON of chow mein and rice. It was honestly enough for three meals, and with tax + tip my bill came out to just above $10. We were all fairly impressed with the food - the only unsatisfying part was the egg drop soup, which was pretty flavorless.  Coming from California tends to make us snobby because we're spoiled with the best Asian food but it was a great value and a good experience.",

The sodium level is moderate - which I'm a fan of considering many times, Chinese restaurants add way too much soy.   I love that they have plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and GF options. The prices are very reasonable, however the portions do match the reasonable prices. Our server, I'm assuming is the owner, was very friendly and struck up nice conversation.

However, the noodles and 2 pieces of meat made great leftovers the next day.  I also ordered a side of potstickers which was also very disappointing. It was very doughy and the meat was weirdly compacted. I've had potstickers before but I'm telling you the meat was like a literal golf ball in terms of consistency.

But my beef and broccoli was so flavorless. I don't even know how that was accomplished when it was drowning in a brown sauce. My meal had ZERO flavor. Was highly disappointed. As for my egg roll again not much flavor. The shell was excellent yet the inside had dryyyyyy flavorless chicken. The dipping sauce I didn't like. It was weird mix between sweet and sour and duck sauce. I did notice everything was VERY greasy. Aside from my food having no flavor besides it's original taste, I kept tasting like a burnt char taste in my mouth. My food wasn't burnt so it make me believe perhaps my food was cooked on a dirty pan. This char taste was literally on every bite.  Let's just say I will NOT be going back.",

Another thing I like is they will customize your meal if you ask. I am trying to stay gluten free so as an alternative they offer a white sauce that has no soy sauce or gluten in it. If you are in the mood for Chinese food check them out.",

    "text": "I'm giving this restaurant a full 5 stars because they definitely earned it.  I must admit, though, that the food was not necessarily memorable. From what I can remember, it was decent and I felt perfectly fine the next day. Not sure what previous reviewers ordered there, but my stuff was fine! Unfortunately, it was not necessarily memorable either... Although I did have this cool rice soup (?) what was extremely steamy and came out sizzling! They had decent plum wine and hot green tea, too :)  What really made us enjoy this place was the service, though. We came for a friend's birthday, and her sister originally planned for Oregano's. However, when we all *finally* found parking at Oreganos, we found out that there was an extremely long wait time (it's always packed, and I don't believe they take reservations there.) Also, there was a huge fight between some customer and the staff at Oregano's, which kind of scared us away. Since we had a relatively large group, we figured it would pretty much be midnight by the time we actually got any food--and we were starving!  Luckily, our birthday friend is not a huge fan of crowds, so she pointed out Little Szechuan across the street. We all wandered over there to find that it was pretty empty, but it was also close to closing time (which we discovered later and felt very bad about--but they never complained or rushed us in the restaurant, and were nothing but kind to us the entire time!)  We had a great time and were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. There was no stress, and our server/lady who runs the place was extremely friendly. She almost became a part of our birthday celebration :) Very kind and charismatic lady, as others have noted on here.   Overall, we definitely enjoyed this place. The food was nothing extraordinary, nor was the restaurant itself in terms of space or decor, but it definitely had its charms and we felt very comfortable and welcome the entire time... even if we did stay way past the time they were closed. :)",

I'm still getting over the separation anxiety from being so far away from my favorite Chinese spot. It was walking distance from my last office, but too far away now to do for lunch...It's been a challenge for me, but I'm working through it. So anyway, I come here with a coworker and we sit down. The place is pretty busy, which seemed like a good sign. It took a while to get our order taken, but once we did, the food was out in a matter of minutes. Not a good sign.  I ordered the kung pao chicken...It was awful. There is just no other way to say it. Wet, gross chicken drenched in a bland sauce with listless vegetables and clumpy white rice. Terrible.   Here's the thing: My dish was $5. The tab for the two of us was $12 with tax, so it's really, really cheap. Of course, you pay a pretty dear price later with the way you feel...  I will never come back. Ever. But, if you're looking for really cheap, really crappy Chinese food, this is an option that you could try. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I did.",

The food is pretty good, the price can't be beat, and the service is second to none. If you ever feel that you are receiving service that's less than excellent, you will promptly see the owner pull aside that employee and give them a talk to remind them of her standards, cause she's got her eyes on everything. I like always being able to get a table, but it's a shame that this place isn't more busy. It's just easy to miss driving by and the sign at night is very dim. My one and only complaint would be that the hot and sour soup could be less sour and more hot. Otherwise, expect to see me here very often :)",

Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I don't know how you can mess up or make bad Chinese food.. it's so simple. If you want extremely over fried/cooked, tasteless, raunchy food, come here. So disappointing, at least it was cheap. You get what you pay for! yet I've had 10 times better Chinese food around the same price. Chinese food in Tempe is weak, I will not be coming back here.

The owners and workers at this establishment are kind, gracious and always accommodate us even when it's busy. For the price we pay, we leave completely full with plenty of food. For about $11-13 you get soup, rangoons, egg rolls and a full entree with rice!  Not that Tempe is expensive, but this place certainly gives you great bang for your buck. Also, the dumplings are great to start. Our favorites also include the $5 sake bomb, orange chicken and kung pao steak.  Cannot wait to return!",

Little Szechuan nailed it as the local, friendly, reasonably priced and delicious family run Chinese restaurant!  I met the owner Swanee who said they have been there for 42 years!  I guess that speaks for itself.   I had pan fried dumplings and Ma Po Tofu.  Both were great.   Wry flavorful and more than ample.  I try not to be my own worst enemy and eat too much when out.  So I didn't order their combo plates.  For $10-12 bucks you get the chosen entree plus soup,  tab puff, chow main and fried rice!  Yep for ten bucks!  I will be back in Tempe often and will be back to eat at Little Szechuan equally as often!",

What I love about Little Szechuan is that they accommodate different spice level and also almost everything can be made vegan or vegetarian. Our usual order is - vegetable noodles, vegetables in garlic sauce, Kung pao chicken and general tso chicken or tofu.",

I didn't end up eating the beef part, just the rice, but to be honest it was hard to eat it so bland. The customer service here is OK, could be better. I would skip out of this visit.",

The food is the most important thing to me, and it's ok.  I really would like business to thrive here, so it's really hard to say the food is \"ok\". (Blame it on the fact that I've gotten pickier over the years.)  I had a combo of mu-shu pork, egg roll, rice, cream cheese puff and chow mein.  The crepe for the mu-shu was too thin to pick it up (they were pre-rolled for the combo) without it falling apart. But I enjoyed it with the hoisin sauce.  The combo also came with soup.  I got the Hot and Sour Soup and enjoyed it with the fried chips.        I love love love supporting local small businesses.  The but, to that, is that small businesses don't always have the funds to redecorate and have everything look fresh and tip-top.  The outside is poorly designed and the inside looks like it needs a make-over.... but really!  What's important to me is the people and the food.  So, stop in and give it a try!",

My favorites are the moo shoo (veggie now, pork before), spicy chinese eggplant with this amazing sauce, and my absolute favorite is the spicy cabbage, it's truly a wonderful thing.   The service here is also excellent, the owners are really wonderful people that go above and beyond to make you feel like family when you visit. They are also incredibly understanding about any dietary needs and have a very adaptable menu. They have even made my family things off menu to make sure everyone had something delicious regardless of dietary restrictions.   I really can't recommend this place enough!",

Also their fried rice just looks like slightly darker white rice, and their $5.50 large wonton soup is enough to fill half a bowl and is hands down the worst Wonton soup I have ever eaten.

    "text": "Worst service I've ever experienced. We waited 2 whole hours for take out. It was Valentines day, so I give them that smallest amount of leeway, but there is no reason to NOT be properly staffed at dinner time, on a holiday. There were employees leaving in the middle of the busiest time, as well as two bussers drinking at the bar, who we didn't know worked there (or did they?) until they got up and started bussing tables. So we're off to a bad start. We walked in to pick up our food after already giving the hour's time that we were told over the phone, and sat waiting for another whole hour. The whole time that we waited, there were phone calls of other orders that I could have sworn were being handed out before our order was even started. They already lost an order for a table of other people, so I don't doubt that would happen to ours. On top of waiting, nobody greeted us or gave us any direction, but they definitely kept waiting tables, as we very obviously stood around, unsure of what to do. Like other places, they have a fish tank that's somewhat crowded with fish, who were acting very desperate for food, as they were literally all (about 10 of them) eating off the rocks and sucking at the corners of the fish tank. We should have left earlier but I tried to give them a shot because all of the reviews were so good. Which leads to the food itself-the teriyaki literally tasted like apple cinnamon sauce. The orange chicken had NO flavor-it was sweet, fried pieces of chicken with no flavor at all. We also ordered one side of fried  rice and it turned out to be white like the others. The crab puffs are barely filled. \"Family owned\" is not an excuse to have terrible, cheap service and especially on a busy day. I wish this went better, because my boyfriend and myself spent most of our Valentine's night waiting for this food, plus the time we took to drive to get it added to the time we lost.",

The noodles in the noodle dish were slightly overcooked, but still tasty. The kimchee was the best I've ever had. So amazing!

    "text": "First of all let me start by saying I was excited to try out this new place that was recommended by a friend. I looked at the reviews and they seemed positive so today my husband and I gave it a chance. We went for dinner and although it said they opened at 5, the doors weren't unlocked until 5:10, that's okay no biggie us and a few other couples were waiting outside. Then we hear a click, and we didn't know if it was open or not because no one bothered to greet us or let us know that it was okay to come in. Once we entered there was a young girl who turned out to be waitress/hostess. They had a a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\" and as we waited the girl who never said hi or greeted us properly just told us which table to sit on. She didn't even take us to our seat, her words were pretty much \"you sit on the corner table to the left\". My husband and I politely sat down, she gave us menus and walked away. We were then greeted by a really nice Asian lady, who must have been the owner or manager. She really made us feel welcomed and was smiling and happy, however she only greeted us and took our appetizer order and we didn't see her until the end. Another young man brought us two empty plates we told him we were ready to order and we went to grab the other girl. When she came to our table she just stood there in front of us, didn't say a word so I gave her our order. She brought us drinks, never asked if we had questions. Once we were eating she was helping other people, she checked on the table next to us ask them if they needed anything else and never checked once on my husband and I. After a while of giving her the benefit of the doubt, I decided to call her since she was on a table close to us. As she was walking away after looking at us and ignoring us, I said \"excuse me\" she looked at me and raised her finger as if telling me to wait and walked away. She went back to refill other peoples drinks without them asking and she never once refilled ours until I asked her to. The food was decent, the owner was nice, but if I had any thoughts about going back I would never do if that waitress is going to be there. I am in the customer service business myself and she was not friendly at all and never checked on our table. If I wanted to see long faces, deal with rude people and be ignored for Something I'm going to pay, I'll just stay home and would not recommend it!",

The hot and sour soup was actually egg drop soup with hot sauce and vinegar, i've never had hot and sour like this before.  The  rice was hard and undercooked. The service was good. I will not return nor will i recommend my friends to eat there. :(",

I read all the rave reviews but ultimately, this place really fell short. My mongolian beef wasn't even full to the top of the box and it was the most expensive thing that we ordered- $10.75. Everything else was kind of meh. Sweet and sour chicken was okay, decent enough, not too sweet. The lo-mein noodles were just really big and thick but had no flavor. You know what they say- fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.",

    "text": "This is my favorite Chinese place in Phoenix. Something that has stood out to me about Little Szechuan is that their food, especially the produce that they use is without fail extremely fresh and not cooked to death. Their food  just has this nourishing, home-cooked quality to it. The service is always quick and Swanie treats her customers like family. Also, Little Szech has the hook up on chili; this is the only restaurant who's number 5 I've sent back because I couldn't take the heat, at which point it was remade free of charge with a couple of sweet pats on the back from Swanie. The chicken wings are to die for.. The portions are off the hook.. I can go on and on!",

Service was slow and there was barley any other customers there. And the inside environment was off setting and not the best. I almost told the waitress I was not going to pay for the meal due to I didn't even eat it really. Will never go there or recommend it to any one ever!",
