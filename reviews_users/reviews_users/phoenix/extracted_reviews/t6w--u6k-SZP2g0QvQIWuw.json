Both where enjoyable, and the sauces from the pretzels were perfect for dipping my fries.  There were TVs in every corner of the restaurant, could easily watch every game they had on without swiveling my head around. It is definitely a great place to watch sports. The service was good, the waitress was cute and had a warm smile which made me feel welcome. I would go back for sure.",

    "text": "Amazing, personable service with a smiling and friendly staff! Emilee was new (we were literally her 1st table as a TK waitress), but she was very knowledgeable of the menu and had excellent  recommendations. Even with our (*ahem) high-maintenance order, the food came out quickly and accurately.  The BBQ bacon cheeseburger gets an A+ ( make sure to try the \"Kilt Burner Mayo\" with it) and Fried pickles (also an A+) were both high points, and the Highland sampler platter was a hit as well (A-). The only knock on our dining experience at all was that we LOVE spicy, and the hottest hot-wing sauce Tilted Kilt had seemed to be hot for flavor, not for downright heat (B-).  Definite additional honorable mention needs to go to our waitress who basically made the experience - Her attentive 5 star service was awesome.  She was observant of our table's needs, yet mindful of not interrupting our ongoing conversations.    Overall - Wow, this is an amazing place with great food and exceptional service...  A must-stop the next time we're in town, we will definitely come back.",

I reminded them it's your second day at this location not your second day ever.  Most of the staff moved from down the street.   Here's the biggest irony of the whole night, I sat next to the owner at the bar.   He obviously doesn't care about service as he seemingly shrugged it off.",

My opinion it's a two star \"pub\", A lot of T.V.'s and mediocre grub, Take a shower or get in the tub, Maybe the girls will give you a chub.  Went with the blackened chicken flatbread, Lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle spread, Right after I ordered I thought in my head, I should have went with cheesesteak instead.  It looked good right when it came out,  After the first bite I wanted to shout,  \"Where is the chicken\" I should have spout, But I sucked it up anyway, and I hate No Doubt.   It's funny to see all the negative reviews,  From all the guys who don't have a clue, Don't get mad when the chicks aren't into you, Go home and pout when you finish your brew.  The ice tea was rich and strong how I like, Snoop Dogg called E-Z-E's mom a Frisco Dyke, If you're a stickler for food then you might dislike, The choices here but no reason to strike.   It's a much better place to watch the game, Don't even bother asking your waitress her name, They get it all day long you're just the same, Another tool in a used BMW, what a shame.   Courtney our waitress was right in stride, Efficient and cute and certainly not wide,  To the girl with the huge tattoos down your side, I would marry you tomorrow and make you my bride!!

I swear, I wanted to drink the broth after I was done.  There were a ton of clams and it was just great.  I also got the Gaelic Chicken... OMG.   I absolutely hate saying \"OMG\" but OMG.  Get it.  If you like chicken, onions, mushrooms, mashed 'taters and an excellent sauce to top it all... GET IT.  The waitress was real nice and cute little thing too. Alana...

If the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits, that can be a bonus, not a replacement for the other two.  There are places doing the \"hot waitstaff\" concept much better, find one and go there. Or better yet, find a bar you like that just happens to have a cute bartender, and be a regular there!  *True story, was once having a bad day and needed a good Irish whiskey to cheer me up. I asked what their selection was and after ~5 minutes of searching their backbar they found a (singular) dusty bottle of bushmill's. Nothing else... weak sauce!",

    "text": "So, all that matters is this -- the babes serving the slop and booze were cute and sexy as it gets. The skirts and revealing low tops are the ultimate fetish. Way better than Hooters.   Having said that, I could see the same thing for free by sitting on Mill Av. Why are guys so desperate they will go to dumps like this just to see college aged girls bare some belly?   TV screens are all over the place but I doubt many male eyes are focused on sports when the babes are making the rounds.  THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE.  It's also overpriced.  Whatever you do don't order fried onion rings. Very gross! Most of the food is what you would expect if you went to grandma's retirement village -- except for the fact that her oatmeal would be better than anything TK serves.  I had to ask for napkins and silverware. Probably most guys that go to this voyeur palace don't use either so the babes don't bother putting them on the table.  If the baby dolls (waitresses) knew anything about the food they served it would help to avoid all the bad food. Expect them to give vacuous opinions about anything on the menu. The babes are very good at one thing -- when presenting the bill they bend down very low to display their firm bosoms. What better way to generate generous tips!  Actually if the babes were offered for dessert, I would give this place a 5 star!",

When i asked the hostess what the deal was she stated \"the tables are reserved for a private party\" i walked out after 10 mins, aparantly tilted kilt does not care about maximizing business on a busy night such as the world series game. Even though i live a short walk away, i will take by business else where. Also bar tenders are not able to multi task other times i have waited up to 10 mins to be served a beer, when there are only 5 patrons sitting at the bar. Bar and food is over priced for the 1 star service this establishment offers. I have never seen so many disapointed patrons walk out of a establishment  as i did today.",

    "text": "Worst experience I've had here!!!!The food was tasty and that's the only way I give this place more than one star.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was almost empty.  It took  our \"server\" 10 minutes to come to our table and ask for our drink order.  Once the order was taken, it took about 10-15 minutes to get the drink.  More time passes and we were finally able to get the server to take our food order.  She has the personality of a paper bag and I'm sure that if she smiled her face would probably crack.  Nice makeup, though.  Once the food was ordered we waited, two of us each ordering a burger, for 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive.  Maybe once or twice the server came walking past our table to ask \"how is everything tasting\", but not convincingly.  No apology for the lateness of the food.  She made us feel as though she were doing us a favor by serving us at all.  The manager of this place needs to read Yelp more often, because I am a staunch believer that everything that is wrong in a restaurant is ultimately the fault of the manager.  If you want a better staff, and you REALLY, REALLY need one, then you need to demand much more of them.  If you don't stand behind good service, neither will your staff.  It's that simple.  Other tables' waitresses seemed to much more pleasant and attentive, but ours did not even ask me if I wanted another beer!  Loss of revenue, Mr. or Ms. manager.  Pull your head out and raise the bar substantially or you will be out of business before you know it.",

Found out that happy hour is from 5pm to 7pm and I have to say they have a good selection of drinks & food on that happy hour menu, I went for 2 long island ice teas and some mozzarella sticks. Also ordered some potato skins with horseradish dipping sauce, omg I love love love horseradish sauce and potatoes so it was a win win for me on this dish!  Also I have been suffering from an extreme sweet tooth, that sometimes only brownies can satisfy, so I ordered the brownie guilt and asked for extra caramel sauces, and yes that did the trick, cured my sweet tooth for sure!   Have to say  it was a fun night, our team placed 7th out of 12 for trivia night (don't judge us haha ) look forward to going back to Tilted Kilt to try some more pub grub, booze and play trivia!",

But that is not the real problem.   Ordered chicken strips which came out in a decent speed. Took a bite and noticed something was wrong. The chicken was still wrapped in Saran Wrap but had still been seasoned and cooked. Got my servers attention and explained what was wrong. Her response was   \"yeah our cooks are always high as fuck\"  and then she walked off. No apology, didn't clear the food, just walked away from the problem. Well I walked away as well and I will not be returning.",

At this Kilt location, it is usually crowded and everybody knows the bartenders. Finally found a bar spot (after an old lady spilled a glass of ice) and ordered just a basic cheeseburger with salt/pepper fries. First off, those fries are too seasoned, so stick with the normal fries. My burger wasn't cooked properly, but they got it right the second time and it turned into a decent, average burger, but well worth the price of free. Happy Hour goes through 7pm and the large domestic beers are only $4. Of course, the women here get graded also and they will get four stars for both looks and service.",

The bartender brought us our drinks and said she would be right back with our menus....which were literally directly behind her....all she had to do was reach behind her and grab our menus. Instead, she went to the end of the bar to our right, made 2 drinks and fetched 2 beers for a waitress, got new drinks for 2 or 3 other customers, and tabbed out a couple of folks. I walked down to the end of the bar and asked her AGAIN for menus...she said, \"I'll be right there\". She walked RIGHT PAST US and the menus TWICE without reaching her hand out to grab one for us. She even waited on 2 customers on the left of us....AGAIN walking past the menus....before she FINALLY stopped, directly in front of us, back to us, and grabbed 2 menus. We had been there 10 minutes and would have already known what we wanted and could have, at this point, placed our order. She was clearly being obstinate and showing us that she'll get our menus when SHE wants to...not when WE wanted them. when she brought our menus....FINALLY!!!....I told her to just tab me out. I paid...no tip...and we went elsewhere for our meal. Whoever at this restaurant reads this review, you need to seriously take a look at your bartenders, at least one of whom is pushing business away from your restaurant. Completely not the point of any business. This is why I was very specific as to when we were there....so the manager can know who was working the bar at the time. I do not know her name but she is very in love with herself, has longish dark hair, and is very proud of her tattoos...one of which is a large flower at the top of her thigh or perhaps on her hip. Very visible however.. Horrible waitress. Horrible face of the Tilted Kilt.  She should be fired immediately and whomever hires her should also beware.",

Wings were pretty dry and seemed like the frozen food isle wings from the grocery store but had decent flavor.  The pickle chips were good and they currently serve San tan epicenter amber draft which is an excellent beer.  Although the food was a little below average the atmosphere is good.  Ladies working there seem happy and were polite and friendly.  The gentlemen also were very polite and friendly which made the visit relaxing.  If you're looking for a good place for food, the kilt is hit or miss.  If you're looking for a place to drink, see some pretty ladies and watch some sports, the kilt fits the bill.

The ice water tasted like they grabbed it out of the street gutter and had a cement taste. Couldn't even drink it. My husband had the burger and garlic fries which he said was good. Not great but good. I had the fish tacos and chips. The fish was broiled and had a freezer taste and was tough. There was only salsa on the fish with one lime wedge. The chips were stale so I told the server. She mentioned that the kitchen staff is new. Sadly, if this place pays a tiny bit of attention to the quality of food, they will draw more women. The place was PACKED and I was one of 2 women in there. Those server girls were so sweet and tried so hard but their product is just not good.  I have no problem with their outfits as long as the food is edible.",

I sat at the end of the bar close to the entrance and was dissapointed to listen to one of the servers who was on the tall side complain and want to leave early if no one walked in the door in the next 20 min. The next day she was complaining about not making any tips when the other servers seemed quite  satisfied and did thier jobs effectively. Not a good impression and hope she finds the right job for herself. Ending on a high note I did decide to tip the busser that as I found out had worked at the Tilted Kilt for six years and made sure every barstool when emptied was readied for the next patron and was always doing something to make things right for customers. He earned every bit of the $15.00 I tipped him over the two visits I was there over the server that stood there expecting tips for minimal work and complaining in front  of cutomers.",

The new location is also much larger than the old location.   Plenty of TVs in the bar. Lots of seating. We love that they have plugs all over the bar area - below your seats at the bars and along some of the walls. Makes it convenient to charge your phone. Wish more places would have this.   The day we visited it was pretty busy as it was happy hour. Service was good and food was hot and fresh. Happy hour pricing and hours are very nice! We were surprised at how reasonable our tab was.   Beer selection on tap is nice. Wide range of other drink selection. Live band inside during happy hour and. DJ outside on the patio.   I'd give it a solid 4.",

We visited on a slow Tuesday evening and the waitress took 15 min. to approach our table and take our orders. In fact, after she took brought our drinks we had to let the hostess know that we had been sitting waiting to order. Even after that, she refilled ONE of my friend's drinks and never checked on us again. She then, took another 20 minutes to take my payment after we were finished dining. Again, we had to let the hostess know that we had been waiting and were ready to pay.  Overall, the food is delicious but the service was truly disappointing.",

I'm told by manager Katie that the wings are sold by the pound I told her my conversation of me trying to get a dozen wings and she apologized but did nothing to correct the problem or issue with an unsatisfied customer.  what I think she should've done was try to correct the problem and make a customer happy what they achieved was that a customer will not go back there again and will use social media to explain that you don't actually get 12 wings as a dozen because The are weigh as a pound. Which means. You can get 5 wings if they weigh a pound.  They should try and explain this so customers don't feel like they have been mislead.    Disappointed",

We got there on a Saturday night and despite not being too busy it took them about 15 minutes to seat us. Once seated we were greeted by the \"Newcastle girls\" who promptly got the guys beers. After another 20 minutes we met our waitress who took our drink order. She forgot the my drink and I finally got it after 45 minutes in the restaurant. About an hour into being there and seeing our waitress twice, we asked the Newcastle girls to please get her so that we could order. She came back very irritated and tried to leave THREE times while we were ordering. I felt like we needed to hold onto her to keep her at the table to take our order. The food was sub par at best and very hard to enjoy with a table full of empty plates and cups that were never cleaned up. The waitress also told us they did not have malt vinegar to go with the fish and chips. We got another waitress who found some and gave it to us. Two hours after arriving the waitress told us she was done and closed us out. We saw her an hour later serving other tables. This is so sad because it is so close to us but multiple people in our complex have said that they are very disappointed with the service. We won't be back.",

The waitresses were quite attractive and definitely we're not shy strutting out their stuff. Though our waitress was a bit slow in response during the game, she did check up on us quite frequently once we got our food. The staff here is pleasant and definitely worth the visit.  The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the Cajun fries during happy hour and for the price it was fairly tasty.  There were also a number of vegetarian options including a spicy bean patty for those burger fans.  Beer selection I felt was limited for being a pub - but honestly guys are we really there for the beer? ;)  Overall a good experience at the kilt. Thank you to all the ladies at the kilt for making this a worthy experience! Look forward to coming back here again. Cheers!",

(while she's taking care of three tables right around us). So she passes us off to some other waitress who's in the area and she comes over all smiling and happy fake attitude... I gotta tell ya, this place is so disgusting, it didn't seem like there was a girl waitress over the age of 17 there, almost makes it seem like the guy hiring them is a fucking pedophile. It just rubbed me the wrong way that's all, wasn't as enjoyable as I hoped it would be.. (watching a game with a buddy) just irritated the shit out of me.

You can watch ASU anywhere in the valley and hear that game, but the OU game was pay per view AND this bar advertised it would have it. So now we are there to see the game (along with A LOT of other fans) but we won't be able to hear it.  Very confusing to watch a game but hear the play by play of a different game. A very disappointing evening to say the least. And to top it off... The owner of Tilted Kilt is supposed to be an OU grad. This is advertised as an OU bar.... NOT!!!  Our server... Aria was great.

Within 10 min we noticed a long narrow table open by the pools tables and sat there instead...this is where things go gown hill. Our server was Raven, wow was she bad.  We were all drinking and getting apps, so she could have made a lot on our table. We would wait 20 min for a drink, and had to go up the the bar a couple of times. We were constantly letting her know that we were thirsty to no avail. At one point she caught up and we had three drinks in front of us at the same time. She then complains that she will get in trouble because of all the drinks on the table when it was her timing that was off. The apps were good, but there was already a sour taste in our mouths from Raven's complete incompetence. I would probably go back, but not in her section.",

No TV at home, for sporting events, Tilted Kilt was the place to go. Was. No more. Went there as a family, wife, 2 kids. The game is on big screen. Great, exactly what we wanted. So let's order food, and let the kids discover the atmosphere of a game. Loud noise, atmosphere, excitement... Instead of that, management (if it can be called that) declined any sound related to the event. So, help me understand... you are showing something on a big screen, but no sound? The answer from management: there is a baseball game coming up, and we are expecting people. Look around, there is 20 people in the whole bar (sad), 15 are watching the game with no sound. We asked, he declined. No one is here for baseball. Obvious. It makes me wonder, where does Tilted Kilt get people to manage businesses? From Airport Security? Or the poorer intellectually and customer service wise you are, the more you have a chance to manage our multi million dollar facility? In short, that was the very last time I ever stepped foot in a Tilted Kilt, the poverty in management customer service made me forget about the kindness of our server, poor cute thing in the middle. Managing is also leading by example, the example shown by management is that you don't care. So i don't care about your business either. There are plenty other places where I can spend my money. I know, I know,  you don't care...",

Either the waitresses had no experience in dealing with these events or this is how typical tilted kilt establishments are ran. Words of advice, not recommended, go elsewhere!",

In addition there was a young man at the bar using foul language very loudly and they had a hard time controlling or changing the atmosphere to our satisfaction. The food was average at best.  We won't be going back. The assistant manager didn't even offer a discount to take care of the issues. Upon our request he presented a very modest discount. Nothing compared to the challenges we faced in his establishment.  I don't recommend this place at all.",

First, our server is putting on the worst fake European accent I have ever heard. Funny thing is once she talked for awhile, it went away. If I wanted to see a broadway production, I would've bought 2 theatre tickets.  I ordered the guacamole burger medium well. She brings out the burger and it's literally rare. Seriously, it's still bloody. I set it aside and I kid you not, 16 minutes later, she finally reappears. She asks if something is wrong so I said the burger is undercooked and I'd like it recooked. She asks if I'd like to have it cooked medium or medium well. I said, well, since I ordered it medium well, let's try that.  She brings it back in less than 5 minutes. It's the same burger with one bite taken out. But this burger was so greasy I couldn't eat more than one more bite. And now the bun is covered in guacamole on the outside so my hand is covered in guacamole. I show my table guests how much grease is pouring off the burger. Oh and the Tator tots were recooked for some reason and were covered in grease also.  She comes back another 15 minutes after this, takes the burger, says nothing.  When my other business associate finishes his meal, she brings the check, says nothing. I pay and leave.  Look. I'm not looking for a free meal but when someone clearly ate 2 bites of the burger after returning it once for a recook, obviously they're not enjoying lunch.  Maybe Silky (her name?!?!) should spend less time on her aspiring acting career and more time on being attentive.",

On Father's day, we went in to watch the World Cup on the big screen on the restaurant side. Soon into the start of the game, the middle tv of the big screen stops working. Seriously!?! Nothing was done to fix it. Obviously it's probably not an easy fix. But from the sounds of it, it's been having issues for a while. Im sorry, but you're a sports bar known to televise big sporting events. You need to keep your TVs, especially the big one working. I felt bad for the big group who took the couches right in front because they ended up having to turn their necks to watch it on one of the smaller tvs. Please get that fixed! Im sure your establishment can afford to get that fixed if you haven't already. I don't want to chance it and go in and have that happen again for another big match.",

Unfortunately, in the 2nd half, a live band showed up and killed the mood. The game audio was turned off and the music was so loud, we couldn't talk to each other anymore. We left shortly thereafter because of the live band. Wish we had been told the audio would only be played for the first half.  Ordered mozarella sticks, onion rings, and tater tots. They were good.   Ordered the skillet cookie and it was gross. I have a sweet tooth and love pizookie desserts. I'd never eat this one again. The ingredients and/or recipe need work. Oregano's has an excellent one.

    "text": "MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! One of the most frustrating and insulting experiences I've had in many years. Stay far away from this place because there are much better places to eat and drink nearby.  Everything started out normally. I came in alone thinking I would catch the happy hour on their \"$2 Tuesday.\" Business was a little slow so I was greeted and seated promptly and within 5 minutes I had spoken to two of the waitresses and placed my drink order. The young lady who took my order even commented that my selection was in line with their \"$2 Tuesday\" pricing event. I was also informed that the waitress who's section I was seated in was \"busy at the moment but would be right over.\"  This is where things started to go sideways. After 20 minutes I still had not been served. Finally, Anisha, my waitress came and introduced herself and informed me that my drink order had been submitted. (no choice of glass size was ever offered or requested - I'll get to this later)  Five minutes later my first drink arrived. Time passes and after finishing my first drink the glass sat on the table, empty, for a good 15 minutes as my server walked past several times before I was asked if I wanted another. This was to be a reoccurring theme during my stay. I ordered another drink and some food. Food quality and turn-around time was good but the wait time for drinks was still unacceptable.  I ordered one more drink and asked for my ticket to be closed out. Upon receiving my bill I noticed that I had been charged FULL PRICE for my drinks. When I brought this to my server's attention, I was informed that the $2 Tuesday price was for a \"regular\" size glass and that I was being served in the 20oz glass. Remember the \"no choice of size offered\" statement above?    I paid the tab but that little (intentional) omission of the size of the glass, was paid for with (what would have been) the young girl's tip.  I WILL NOT BE BACK and I strongly suggest you take your business elsewhere! There are plenty of other nearby establishments who treat their customers with more respect, honesty and provide more efficient customer service.",

We were unsure of the plans for the night; just a group of guys out for a bachelor party. We told the host we'd probably just get drinks. We decided after waiting 15 minutes for our drinks that we should probably eat. Our server was busy it seemed so I asked the hostess if she could put a food order in. She asks the manager and she takes my order. Didn't get anyone else's. Finally the server comes by and she has our drinks. (It felt like 25 minutes, but I know it was probably around 15). I let her know I gave the host my food order since we decided to eat and she looked busy. NOW. Here is the best part: she literally stops moving. Turns her head and gives me the dirtiest glare I have ever seen! I thought I was being helpful but once again, an unwelcoming feeling bestowed our table.

I was actually there on a random weeknight with a buddy and I could count the number of people on two hands.  It wasn't exactly hopping, but the service was great.  A couple of the waitresses actually sat down at our table and chatted for a while.  Can't complain...",

The bar is located on Warner just west of Kyrene on the north side of the street.  Lot's of beer brands available, both on tap and bottles.  Food is nothing to write home about, what I would call average quality. I'm sure the guys are not there for the quality of the food. I'd guess they are there for the outfits worn by the waitressess, which, by the way, are quite applealing. My buddies and I golf a lot in the east valley, so it's a good place to get a bite to eat after playing 18 holes.",

The large screens are neat, but sitting in the uncomfortable chairs sitting to close to them was bad planning.  I believe the owner is a Sooners fan so that game rules over others, even Devils games.  The volume wasn't on for the Devils game, wth.  Waitress was lazy, didn't come by the table often.  Chicken Tenders were good, with sweet and sour sauce.  Sweet Potato Fries are gross, doesn't taste anything like 'em.  I'd go to hang out and not expect much in the future.",

I am really big on service, coming from the industry for over 7 years, so when I get bad service, I get in a bad mood. The girls are pretty lucky they are hot because I don't think it would fly otherwise. The fish n chips I had were not good, obviously just poured from a bag, which is disappointing. I felt the server was really flaky and inattentive, she was sitting with a group of guys pretty much the whole time, while I was waiting for my napkins, then my malt vinegar, ugh. Then she came to tell us she was going on a smoke break and I don't think I saw her after that. All in all, I can appreciate a cute girl in sexy kilts (I was actually hired to work here when they first opened) and I love me some good beers and flat screens, but I will pass on the whole dining experience.",

It's a good sports bar, lots of TVs playing games and not too loud, clean, etc. I liked the long bar in the center, it looks like a long shuffleboard table that you can sit on either side of, good for a small or large crowd. The staff was friendly, always making sure I had enough jack and coke (which was on happy hour so how could I say no?) I really liked the tk Irish nachos. I thought this place would be kind of like hooters but I felt like it was more like a regular sports bar, just with a theme. Maybe I've been to way too many clubs and bars that have staff dressed in similarly small outfits. I guess I make this comment for other girls that might think this is just a place for guys, I didn't think it was tacky in that way.  I would add this place to the list if I was looking for a chill sportbar.",

The waitresses are dressed in bras with their boobs almost completely hanging out and the skimpiest little skirts - I wouldn't even call them skirts. It is a whoring establishment, with a restaurant/bar front. The waitresses are not at all professional. I am thoroughly and totally disgusted, especially after the owner goes on national TV pretending that his pick up bars with scantily clad girls are professional restaurant establishments. They are not. They are far from it. Start with the costume.  It covers almost nothing.",

My niece ordered BBQ sauce instead of ranch and mandarin oranges instead of fries and when the food came out she got ranch and fries, when the check came we got charged for the waitress' mistake.  I ordered chicken wings with blue cheese and guess what i received ranch dressing, on the ticket i was charged for that also.   I was also kind of surprised that for the price of wings you only get 8.  The parking sucked on top of all this.  I was so embarrassed that i brought my out of town guest to this place and after watching Undercover Boss, very sad.  The owner might want to check out this place himself.

The guys serving behind the bar are pretty good and attentive, but recently they have hired a few girls who are rather inattentive and don't seem to care. More interested in chatting with the guys behind the bar....  12/1/13  - service is still atrocious, but funny how one gets used to it.    So I walked in last week and thought I would see if it's as bad as ever.  Sat at the counter across from the bar as usual for approx 10 mins with the odd server walking past me without asking if I needed anything. So I do my usual and walk over and ask the bar man for a pint. Oh oh well they are not selling Boddingtons anymore - so that's a real downer. Never mind I ask for a Sam Adams and take it back to my seat, The barman says he will send a waiter over to take my food order. No one comes over of course so after another approx 10 mins I walk over and ask one of the waitresses for some fish and chips. Well I finish up my pint and fish and chips and ask for the bill. So the bill comes, but it's approx 2 x what it should be. I must say the server was very sweet, but very new and had obviously been doing this only for a few days. I wouldn't blame the server, but the totally useless management. How difficult can it be to ensure that you assign servers to each set of seats ; so that customers aren't having to hunt down waitresses?  That reminds me - I better check my credit card to see if they backed out the double charge....",

And it was sliced like you would for a sandwich, not a dinner. Also, two huge wedges of undercooked cabbage, and NOT ONE POTATO on the plate. When we told our waitress, who, by the way, was very apologetic and very helpful, she apologized and said they ran out of potatoes ....She asked if there was another choice to be made. We asked for just a corned beef sandwich. Less than a minute later, she started they were out of corned beef! So much for a nice Irish dinner! Oh .... and the irish stew I ordered?? It was NOT . It was basically a watery Irish Soup!! And the 'garlic bread' that came with it was basically an oversized hot dog roll.",

Both soap dispensers were empty. Really? How is that missed? *Many in our group ordered salads for an appetizer. They didn't come out until the main meal was served. *It took close to 30 minutes for the food to come out. We were late coming back to the office from our lunch. *My hamburger and tater tots were lukewarm. The bun was hard. We didn't have time to send it back. *The salad was terrible. The lettuce looked old and soggy. *Overall the food was below average in taste and quality. Maybe if I had a few drinks it would have been better?  Overall, I won't go back. This was the consensus from the group of (6) that I was with.  For a brand new restaurant, I'd of thought they'd be on their \"A\" game and wow customers. When there was no soap in two different dispensers in the bathroom, that should of been a warning of things to come.",

Bummer for someone who likes smooth guacamole and doesn't like onions or tomatoes in their guac. Ordered the guacamole burger before getting the chips n salsa/ guac :/ wrong choice. Since we already know the outcome of the guac.  Oh well still a great burger.... but I paid an extra 1.99$ upgrade for onion rings on the side and only got 5 onion rings. Dissatisfied. My fiancee had a fantastic \"hangover burger\" but only got about 11 fries...   needs better attention to the sides....",

    "text": "So, if your curious as to why you experience a lunch lull with a mere 32-35 patrons in your dining room establishment for an hour rotation...it probably has a ton to do with the lack of pride going into the food.  Generally I strive to only write positive reviews because a bad experience is typically the only time a consumer is driven to review at all.  But in all my reviews I rave about how an establishment works to ensure the front and back of the house are a well oiled machine. This is what breeds success in the customer service industry. However, it's very apparent the daytime staff at this location is incredibly used to the ladies on the front end picking up their slack. Coming in prepared, being prompt and addressing issues.  I can't knock someone for not having the understanding that kids food on a ticket should be dropped first because if anyone's food should be cool, it should be those who have minimal temperature tolerance. So the fact that the kids food came last and was too hot to even be handled by the adults I chalked up to the cooks not having children of their own. User error. However. The fact that all the adult food came out cold... the burgers I provided at my son's 1st birthday party were served at a reasonable hot temperature from a park grill by myself, who went to culinary school for baking and pastry arts.   Then, my guests get warm food because I value their company and understand what their presence brings to my life. However, the day shift manager was informed that the food came out completely cold but didn't address the situation at all. That was left to our waitress who had to apologize and bat eyelashes because typical lashing out at something like that would be a shit tip from a patron.   I'm watching these girls run around and do right by their tables while presumably lackluster food is being pumped out to every patron in this establishment today. Perfection isn't expected nearly as much as visible effort. And unfortunately I wasn't drunk enough to enjoy food that was as warm as bath water that has been sitting for 5 hours.  All I can say is that it starts at the top. And as a manager or a shift lead, receiving a reasonable and mildly delivered complaint and doing NOTHING to attempt to correct the situation is a direct reflection of the work ethic that trickles down through the staff.   Beautiful girls working diligently for deserved tips do not make up for a burnt out line staff that can't pump out food in a reasonable time or at a decent temperature. The entire point of consuming a meal is to have it warm. This is the basis of the \"eatery\" portion of the business and the fact that it was disclosed that a manager was back in the kitchen only makes the situation more dismal.  This is a franchised business, and sure we could stay shift managers or GMs forever, but if this was your business, you might take a bit more pride in what is coming out of that kitchen. People drink more when they eat more. But I enjoyed my singular Vanilla Swirl.",

It was late on a Sunday afternoon, and I was parked at Home Depot across the street so I walked there. In other words, my expectations were low already, shouldn't be hard to please me right? Ha...  As we approached the door, we were greeted by a chalkboard sign showcasing the featured beer of the month. August's beer of the month: Bud Light. Wtf. Already I am rethinking this place, but we're thirsty so we go in.  Teeny tiny shirts and skirts on the waitresses: yeah, not my favorite part of the place. My male friend agreed, but you walk in knowing what you're getting into, so whatever. Skanky, dirty, sticky, food-coated bar during a lull with no customers: also, not so much a fan. Chose a seat and had to move because I didn't want to put my arms down on the counter.  The encounter with the bartender went roughly as follows: My friend: So, the beer of the month is... Bud Light? Really?  Bartender: Yep, Bud Light. (straight, serious face) Friend: Uh, yeah, because clearly Bud Light is the best beer ever. Bartender: Well, it is the best beer ever. I mean, it's my favorite beer. (still serious face, but now slightly defensive tone for mocking his beer-love.) Friend: Right. So I guess I'll just have a Miller Lite then.  It's not a horrible place, and I'm sure I'll end up back there. I just think documentation is necessary when a bartender says his favorite beer is Bud Light.",

The ASU game was quite painful to watch, so I was relieved to be able to watch the AUB LSU game on the center screen without too much effort.  The beers came out cold (Sierra NV yeah!), and we even had a penny beer token thingy-ma-jig that the birthday boy in our group claimed for a Kilt Lifter.  The waitress didn't even take the token away.  Sweet!  Our waitress was cool and came by every once in a while to check up on us.  She didn't even ask if we wanted separate checks - she just came by with all of them separated out (+1 bonus point).  One gripe I had came from my food order.  I ordered fries at the same time someone else ordered a wrap (which comes with fries).  My order of fries came out 15-20 minutes after the wrap+fries came out.  What the heck?  I'm hungry!  The fries were pretty good by the way, and came in a decent-sized portion.",

The food is decent, if you're there get the Irish nachos because they're always a hit (fresh potato chips + ground sausage / cheese sauce / fresh tomatoes).  I just feel like here, more so than any Hooters or Twin Peaks I've been to, the girls aren't particularly friendly or attentive.  Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but let's just be honest - most of the time when a group decides to come here it's for the scenery.  Flirty and friendly behavior will almost always equal bigger tips - but I feel like here more than the other boobie themed joints the girls / management don't get that concept.  If you're here for a sporting event, you can get a giant tower of beer that they bring to the table and that's actually pretty cool.  I suppose what I am saying is, I don't like it when places half ass their concept.  If you're going to have scantily clad ladies serving food and drink, they should make an effort to entice you to come back - rather than remind you that they're all aware how attractive and unattainable they are.",

It was pretty crowded as many people were looking forward to this fight night. We found a few spots up at the bar and squeezed our way in. We were immediately handed menus and offered beverages which we took advantage of. Throughout the evening, we enjoyed ourselves as the service was surprisingly attentive for the amount of business they were doing. The wings were delicious, but cannot say the same for our attempt to be healthy. The side of steamed veggies were just basically over cooked frozen vegetables. Oh well, it is a sports bar... All in all, it was a good night and not too expensive. We will be back.",

The service was also spot on. I ate before I arrived, so didn't eat there...but my friends did and the food looked fresh and delicious! They have 2 pool tables (lack of brush to clean off all the debris on the pool table prevented me from giving them 5 stars), tons of TV and lots of room.   We had the only table with females, which was typical for this type of bar i guess. The servers were dressed in stuff that may have been seen on the VS fashion show!   The prices are very reasonable too! Will definitely be back for the food ^_~",

    "text": "While it's difficult for me to give a place that serves Dead Guy Ale and cider on tap one star, the \"pint\" glass issue bothers me, as an honest and seasoned drinker. American pints are supposed to hold 16 ounces of delicious liquid happiness, but Tilted Kilt's thick-walled, thick-bottomed glasses only seem to hold 12 ounces (I also tested this with a 12-ounce bottle). I just don't see this place as having to cut corners like that, given its popularity.  Not to mention the fact that it's a bit shameful for an Irish/English themed bar to not serve Imperial pints, in my opinion.  Aside from that fact, it seems to be a decent place to watch games, ogle scantily clad waitresses, be cheated out of 4 ounces, or do other quite manly stuff that manly men do in sports bars. The food is also largely forgettable, but adequate for sports bar food.",

I love the 3 dollar jack and cokes (24/7 - 365), and the hot wings here are to fall back in your chair and die for.

    "text": "I used to come here to play poker. It's a chain in the same spirit as Hooters or The Library in that they feature scantily clad young girls serving alcoholic beverages and a variety of fried foods while multiple televisions pointed at every angle display whatever sporting events that happen to be happening at the time.   Tilted Kilt is a little more like the LIbrary in terms of the outfits the girls wear... similar to a stripper's version of a Catholic School Girl. I've always found the Hooters thing to be quite unappealing. If you come to Tilted Kilt for the buxom girls, you'll be both relieved to know that they are typically of the attractive ilk and disappointed to discover that they will never take their tops off for you - no matter what you tip them (just a guess, I've never tested this theory). It's hardly worth an ogle... maybe a glance from your periphery.  So what's left is the food and the drink. Happily, the food is pretty decent - though it's odd. They have salads topped with sandwich innards and sandwiches filled with salads. I can't say it's health food, but it's tasty enough. I mean, who puts a philly cheese steak on top of a salad? I guess Tilted Kilt does. And it's not bad. Some of it is a bit flavorless, but add a bit of salt and it's fine. And some of it is downright great for that type of food. One of the better salad wraps I've had.   This is definitely a man's hangout. I wouldn't suggest bringing a date here unless she also likes boobs busting out of tiny tops with bras showing, greasy fried meatatarian cuisine, and your attention drawn away from her lovely eyes towards whatever motocross, boxing or basketball event (in other words: beer commercials) happens to be on.  The atmosphere is fairly generic, but comfortable. The drinks are stiff enough. And the prices aren't ridiculous. It's like any number of places - Red Robin, TGIFridays, etc... except for the boobs.   This place is between a 3 and a 4 for me, but since I can't say I'm a \"fan\" I'll have to leave it at 3. It's nice enough though and I wouldn't turn down an invite to go here... it just wouldn't be a place I'd pick.",

    "text": "We went here last weekend after an even in AZ. There was a HUGE group of us, we took up two rows of tables.   The atmosphere was good, prices are affordable and even with a group as big as our, we had excellent service up until the end.   The food was tasty, I ordered the cheese steak, a friend of ours had the classic nachos with chicken and beef. Both were good. The tea was a bit.... bland? I only had a taste, as it was my husband's drink. It left much to be desired.   At the end of the meal, we were the last to be given our tabs and the server never came back to take the payment. We waited for about 10 minutes while our groups was dispersing. Wouldn't have been such a big deal if we didn't have to follow some of them to get home. When I approached our server to offer my card, it was as though I was interrupting her for no reason... then she remembered she hadn't collected our payment. I was tempted to walk out, but couldn't do that to the poor girl. I know what it's like to be busy, but there could have been more attention to detail here.   I would go back, for sure, though. It was a good place.",

They know they can't do better....)  Are you ready?    Scottish Hooters  See if this is familiar to you.  Food that is ok in general with a couple of \"specialties\" that rise a bit above the rest.  Lots of big screens on all over the place,  showing the big games that are on that night.  And for some reason guys often aren't able to finish a sentance without pausing as their eyes follow one of the waitresses walking by.    Now add to that an AMAZING amount of noise.  We were part of a large party and I couldn't hear more than 1 person from me without the other person yelling.  Then know that several times during your evening there will be jokes about what the girls, and the boys (bartenders) really are wearing under their kilts.   It appears there is quite a bit of parking, but folks getting there after 7 on a Friday night had to park at the shopping center across the street.  It gets THAT full.  My friend, after checking out \"the View\" said, \"Ok, I'd drive from Surprise for a glass of water here.\"  That really describes it from a male perspective.  No one will talk about the food when you leave. Only the kilts.  Which isn't so bad....",

    "text": "I had no idea that this place was a large national chain because, surprisingly, it has more of a 'local-bar' feel, complete with all the tools and townies in here who think that they will hook up with a waitress because he ordered a Hoegaarden instead of a Miller Lite.    Its a totally cheesy bar, but its not bad as a gamewatching spot for a game that you aren't completely invested in, maybe catching a beer, some chicken tenders, and a couple of quarters of the game before moving on to Home Depot across the street or something.    Writing this review, I'm actually surprised upon recollection how many times I had been here.  We used to come for Suns playoff games, which was virtually impossible for seating purposes (at this point they start having table-waits) and parking.  The atmosphere was better than your average Valley sports bar however.  People seem to really care about sports here, though I wouldn't really classify it as a 'sports bar', rather a neighborhood type bar with screens.  I also used to come here for poker nights, which I doubt they still do as too many 'bags came to drink iced tea and wouldn't tip the waitresses.  Maybe someone can inform if they still do.  Then, we used to come after soccer rec league games, which was kind of a dweeby thing to do in our footy kits, but whatever.  It was a few years ago, anyway.  Still, this is the type of place that gets people right from their beer guzzler rec leagues and into the bar still in their Mark Mitsubishi (Mark Mitsubishi) sponsored baseball tees.  This is the primary reason why you won't want to stick your hands into the huge barrels of Gardetto's mix, despite the unreal temptation for a dabble.    Overall, i suppose I can't really hate on this place too much.  Its kind of weak, but it is a decent option, particularly in the 'Took, where there just ain't many other options.  Just don't be one of the wanks who tries to pick up a waitress for the love of God.",

Three large pieces of fish (I think it was cod), breaded to perfection with a Samuel Adams beer batter, with good fries and an excellent cole slaw! I don't think I've ever seen cole slaw like that (paprika and black pepper on top).  The service was pretty good (we had minor issues but we were there for over three hours and had about 4 or 5 different servers) and of course the sights they are known for were on point!

    "text": "Got to lunch today at 11:45 and was brought drinks within the first 5 minutes of us being there so that was okay. We put our order in when the drinks came and then proceeded to wait for 25 minutes. When we got there it wasn't nearly as busy and the table behind us came in after and got their food first. I ordered the spicy mother clucker in a lettuce wrap with garlic fries and told the waitress Alex that I have a dairy allergy, my husband ordered the jalapeno burger. When our food did FINALLY come out more than 25 minutes after putting an order in, it once again was not as expected. I got a piece of chicken that was barely dressed in any hot sauce at all and tossed on top of a slice of tomato and put between two very sloppily large pieces of lettuce, they couldn't even toss the red onion onto their mess.. The garlic fries were topped with parmesan cheese. The male manager who brought our food out to us asked if everything was okay and I told him it wasn't. He said he would fix it right away and I asked him to please bring me an extra plate and corrected fries, but I was hungry, so leave the chicken \"wrap\" He then brought me a basket of fries that was not seasoned at all. I shook my head and my husband told him that I had ordered garlic fries with no cheese. He said he would \"fix the problem\" but at this point I'm already annoyed and tell him to just please stop.  I ask my husband to pass the salt to season the fries only to see she hadn't even given us any. My husband finished his lunch and I finished my chicken breast and a few fries with no drinks. It seemed as though both the manager and waitress were avoiding our table after the awkward screw up on their end, so no drinks for us. She finally does come back and timidly asks if she can get us anything, to which we respond \"our check\". I'm glad to see they didn't charge us for the $1.99 garlic fries.  Rang us up for the full bill and we left.  The last 3 times I have come here with my husband, my food has been wrong. 1 set of customers doesn't make a big difference, but we definitely will not be back. This place has gotten too careless. At least they used to give a damn about what they serve.",

There are plenty of tv's to enjoy any type of sports games. The managers are always walking the restaurant checking in on their customers. I had the fish and chips which was very good. You get 3 big pieces plus the fish is very tender.  Their fried pickles are delicious as well. I'm a sucker for fried pickles.   I had a great time here and appreciated having a wonderful server.   Plus they have a Yelp checkin offer.",

After a while, my husband went inside to ask if we needed to order inside. The manager was standing at the front door while a staff member replied someone will get to us. So, we waited even more. Finally, I stepped out and was already outside the premises when a waitress finally acknowledged us. The sad thing is she was asked by her manager to come to our table when this was not even her working section.  Does not even deserve a star!  We drove next door to Philly's Sports Grill. We waited to be seated and the bartender told us to take any seat. A waitress came right away to acknowledge us. The food and service rock!!!  October I e-mail the corporate to let them know. I received no acknowledgment.  This tells me it is poor management. The good side is there is always a better place to go.",

Count on waiting 15 minutes until someone acknowledges your party and long lags between drink refills. The food is just \"ok\" with over-cooked burgers and mediocre fair. The ambiance and TV's are good, which keeps me coming back, and the waitresses are sumptuous, but poorly trained in service. It has always been this way and probably always will be.  I think they actually train the waitresses in how to be inattentive. How else could it possibly be this poor for so long?",

    "text": "We needed a place to watch the Dbacks game today, as my Cox service was out. Since it was lunchtime, we decided to try the Tilted Kilt, having not been there since they opened this new location on Warner and Priest. It was not busy at all.  I looked around to see where the Dbacks game was showing, realized it was not (how does a pseudo sports bar not know when the local team is playing on TV?), and asked if they could put it on. It took about 10 minutes, but they did accommodate my request. The reason for my 1 star review is based almost entirely on the cheeseburger I ordered.  Since it is probably one of the most basic and popular items ordered, I thought it would be a great burger. I could not have been more wrong. The \"cheese\" looked like it had been brushed on (American) and what was there had almost completely melted away.  The lettuce was nothing more than a single piece of leaf lettuce that had been put under the patty and looked wilted and greasy.  One small tomato was also under the meat (and thus warm).  Just a horrible presentation of a burger. To their credit, the meat and the bun were pretty good.  Of course, I had to ask for condiments, as nothing comes on (or with) the burger. The pickle was a spear on the side.  The service was okay, but after complaining to the waitress (who offered to get me more cheese and lettuce, which I declined), I did not hear from the manager.  I was charged full price for everything.  My wife's chicken sandwich was good, apparently.  While the overall experience was okay (even with the loud music playing at noon on a Monday), the burger was enough for me to decide not to return.  How does a cook let this come out of his kitchen?  I'm just glad I only wasted $11, and didn't buy anything more expensive.  For those folks who read reviews before going somewhere, don't let the \"scenery\" guide your decision to go there.  Look how many bad reviews there are in the first few months of 2019.  There are way too many choices to put up with this.  Management should address these issues.",

The rest of the staff were very upbeat, everyone smiling and really enjoying what they do. I love seeing people having a good time and providing great customer service.

Our waitress was great - there when we needed her, not in our face. We were probably a little loud as well, but that fit right in. Our check wasn't bad either, for three people we spent about $15 each.   Last Friday, I went in for some afternoon bar therapy and to watch the first few UFC fights. The two bartenders, whose names I forget, were spectacular. They had the bar under control, great teamwork.

Well, they did. Our table of 4 waited for 15 minutes and never got so much of a look from any of the waitresses. The restaurant was at best half full, and it was a football sunday, so I would expect to get a server when I sat down.  The waitresses and hostess, the ones that I could see that wouldn't help us or acknowledge us in any way, were all ugly and looked pissed off to be there.  I had seen the owner on undercover boss and thought he was a tool, so I'm kind of glad that I didn't spend any $ there, and I hope you don't as well.

Opted for the chicken tender wrap, \"tilted\", with blue cheese instead of ranch.  The wrap was pretty good, though I should have asked for the blue cheese on the side.  The fries were excellent - crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My objective female opinion is that the uniforms for the girls here are far more flattering than those heinous \"flesh\" colored tights and bright orange running shorts that the Hooters girls have to wear.   As for the pub part, one of the group said it best - \"We should have come for happy hour instead of lunch.\"  That's what I'm going to recommend the next time the vendors suggest this place for lunch.

We got the Irish nachos, which were on happy hour ($5) and the Kilt Club and split everything. I really enjoyed the Club. It had a pesto mayo on it that was really yummy and really good bread. The nachos were good but I enjoyed the sandwich more.  I also loved the atmosphere. As a sports junkie, it was basically my kind of joint. They had drop down screens that played baseball so I was a happy camper.  Definitely a fun place to check out the eye candy and watch a ball game. I'll be back.",

The ambiance was okay however the service here is horrible. The servers \"Kilt Girls\" would congregate around the reception desk, and look board, instead of \"up-selling\" or even just coming by the table and ask if we are okay. I did notice smiles when our server came to our table, however when our \"Kilt Girl\" and other servers left their table, it turned into grins, and bared the look of a un-enthused employee. We had to flag down our waitress several times, she forgot things we had asked for and was incredibly slow. The entire waitstaff seemed lethargic and unenthusiastic about their product and atmosphere. The servers represent the product and should be part of the product they are creating. Places like \"Hooters\" are well trained and confident and energized about their product, along with representation, presentation and theme. The hard critique just comes from over 35 yrs in the entertainment, & service industry...which is a hard thing to sell. This brand is a nice concept and looks nice, and albeit may be okay with the regulars, however with a seasoned service veteran I can see the flaws in this model. It could use improvement  in several phases. I believe the staff could utilize a great deal of re-training with an emphasis on customers service and pride in their brand.

As the rest of party came in the wait time was drastically increased as to how quickly she came back to our table. From us ordering our drinks it took almost 30 mins to get a beer because they were out of so many different ones. We did express our concerns to the manager and it took another 30 mins to get our food order started. From there it went down hill even more. Orders were not taken correctly food took way to long to come out a member of the party even ended getting her food after everyone else had already finished. After we expressed our concerns to the Manger the server was removed from our table. We were told our meals would be comped as we were there for 2 hours and and hour and a half of it was just waiting for food or drinks. When we asked for the bill it took another 30 mins to get all of them which our meals were definitely not comped for what so ever and not even a discount was given or even an apology for slow service.

WARNING watch out for the bartenders writing in/changing tips on your receipts....Didn't notice on my account until a week later, but the bartender took it upon herself to write in a $3 tip on my receipt. I keep my receipts and usually leave a $ in the tip spot(meaning I left cash as tip)  but I can't believe some bartender was so damn greedy she needed to write in a 3 tip on my receipt which easily changed the total from 11 to 14. Smart. Wonder how many times this b!tch has gotten away with that trick. Name on ticket was MARCI, but I don't remember if that was the actual bartenders name.  Will not ever be back!!",

They came back with our food. The one asked do you want a drink. Our thoughts the food is now here so no. Lol. So we drank the waters. My girlfriend then orders a dessert. She asked if I wanted more water I said yes please never got the water. They bring the dessert. Still no water but the dog at another table got his water. As a dog lover I understood. One says oops we never brought the water. We both eat the dessert. They bring us the check still no water as they said they had been cut for the evening from management. We paid the tab. Still even after eating it all I drank the two sips from my girlfriends water. Then we left. No tip, which I felt bad about. I've never done that. But I went to the near by QT and brought a bottled water. Never again will we make that mistake. Zipps continues to win in our house.",

Kind of weird, but whatever. Speaking of which, the menu had an insert left over from St Patrick's day.   I've been to the Tilted Kilt in N Scottsdale and I've never been really impressed by the talent at either location. There's usually only 2 attractive girls out of 6-7. And they really should not allow girls with flabby bellies to wear skimpy clothing. In my not-so-humble-opinion. The problem with Arizona and this country now is that any chick under 140lbs is considered \"hot\" which is really fucking funny.  The TVs here are projection/15-ft variety which are fairly sharp and add a nice touch. And the bar gets packed for sporting events. But $25 after tip for 2 Miller Lites and a qeusadilla seems kind of high. A Miller Lite draft costs $5 for the largest or $12 for a pitcher. Why not sell a 32oz draft for six bucks? Tilted Kilt is alright but in this economy, I'd rather hit up a real sports bar or a shitty dive if I'm slumming it.",

I sent it back for a kids hamburger, specifically no cheese and 45 minutes later we got a cheeseburger. My 7 year olds food took AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES after we  arrived.  Her Lemonade took 1 hour after 3 requests for her drink.   I asked the server if the kids meal came with a drink or any sides, she said yeah, like brocolli or fries.  So I ordered fries.  Then I was charged for a side basket of fries along with the 2 kids meals of mac n gross cheese soup and the messed up burger.....as she dropped the check and said she removed the mac n cheese.  Ha.  Also asked if they had bangers and mash and she shook her head no and acted as she had no idea what that was.  This is a Irish pub and they don't serve sausage and potatoes. I wont even get into how many times my friends at another table checks were wrong or how many messed up items they had.  We waited for our second round of drinks for 25 minutes.  Discouraged we asked our friends at another table and they had the same lame service.  They were also given our round of drinks (the huge and complicated 2 drinks we ordered AGAIN) and sent them back unknowing they were ours and they weren't theirs.  Hot mess.  We also saw sides on their burger entree(tater tots) that was never offered to us.  It was Horrible! Under staffed and under experienced waitress.  Won't be back.  Sorry TK.  I'm pretty easy going but this service ruined our evening.  I can't actually spend money here after an experience like that.",

    "text": "Horrible service. Disappointing food. Huge waste of almost 2 hours.   We stopped in this afternoon for lunch and to catch up with a buddy.  He arrived 10 min before us so I was quite surprised to see he didn't have a beer in front of him, we received our drinks and still he waited. It took OVER 20 MINUTES for him to get his Miller Light, there was no apology, no suggestion for a bottle or a different beer. We just sat there, being ignored.   It took forever for us to actually get her attention long enough to place our order as well.  The only good thing about our experience was the spinach and artichoke dip we had as an appetizer (it was actually really good, but not good enough to bump my review from 1 star).  My buddy, who was quite depressed about the NASCAR race being delayed obviously needed another beer to drown his redneck sorrows but despite telling our server, the beer never came so he went up to the bar and asked the bartender to pour him one. After she poured it, she went and pulled the tickets of all the drinks she needed to pour. There were five tickets, clearly standing there staring at her nails was more important.   Finally our food came but we still didn't have silverware, (despite wanting some when our appetizer arrived). Since it's a little difficult to eat a salad without a fork... I immediately asked for one (again) along with more water. Now you'd think grabbing silverware would be on the top of her priority list, nope...chatting (by chatting, I mean flirting with her obnoxious fake laugh) with another table was obviously more important. After sitting there patiently waiting for a while, my buddy got up in search of a fork. One of the other servers brought the silverware over but slammed them on the table with one hell of an attitude. At this point, I'm so over this restaurant.   Then I bit into my chicken. It's very possible it was cooked yesterday, left under the heat lamp for a day then cut into strips when my order came back. I've had jerky that's been easier to chew!!  Finally our server came over to ask how everything was...well I still don't have my water and my bf would like more coke, but I'm not holding my breath.   We spent the whole time waiting and waiting for our server to do her job. It was ridiculous, at one point we started timing her...8 minutes for a refill is completely unacceptable!!   She's lucky I wasn't the one paying, there's no way she would have received the 20% tip my bf felt obligated to leave. She didn't deserve it. She was horrible, incompetent and lazy!   I will NEVER be back, not just to this location but the tilted kilt in general.",

It was around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy.  We were able to find a table and settled in.  I ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger & Fries and washed it down with a pint of Smithwick's.  I've never had Smithwick's before, so I was anxious to give it a try.  It wasn't bad....a little lighter than I expected, but not bad.  The Burger came out after a short wait and I devoured it in short order.  It was pretty good and the portion is large...filled me up nicely.  After dinner, we hung out and watched a little baseball.  It was trivia night and it was kind of hard to follow the game with all of the trivia announcements.  Our waitress was nice and friendly and kept our glasses full.  Overall, a good night out.

Should I continue probably not this visit was less of an experience than an endurance not so far as a new place that should be an experience-not so much!if the owner had any sense about himself he'd call me!",

On a night to see the World Series game they should be sitting down people quick to make money instead there pulling the whole \"it's reserved\" crap. The girls here have horrible customer service and the whole staff is useless. I chose to come here because i live right next to the apartments and it's very convenient to walk to but with the bad service today I think I'll take my business to zipps better.",

But what was really upsetting was seeing my bank account this morning showing a debit higher than the actual  total. I reviewed my receipt again to make sure I didn't add incorrectly, and I hadn't.   The total was $15.40 and I left a $2.60 tip, for an even total of $18. The amount charged to my account was $19.25. I won't cry over $1.25, but I thought to share this to caution others who also pay with debit cards and spend a lot more $$$ at this Tilted Kilt.  Double check your receipts vs your bank account.",

I went in to have fun with some friends on Wednesday trivia night.  You know, have a drink or two and some dinner and fun. Well, this past Wednesday the service really stunk. Went and sat at the middle bar area so we could see the screen to play trivia. Waitress did not even try to greet us even when she passed us. Over halfway through the first round we asked Jeff, the awesome trivia announcer, if all the waitresses were on strike and only then did one come around. She was in a hurry to take the order and didn't even get the full order. The only reason she even checked on us afterwards was because we needed refills and I went to the bar myself to get them. During the whole time she was too busy helping the guys, putting her \"assets\" out there when walking by the guys and checking on....guess who... the guys. I know, it's a bar catering to the guys, but, if she would have been a good server she would have known that the girls also tip. Also....a word for the owner... I was going to order more than just a soda and an appetizer, but you lost that sale that night due to your poorly trained server. I hope when you move to your new building your serving staff will be better trained that all customers matter!",

With that being said... stop into the Warner location only if Felipe is bartending. I've bartended for about 10 years and seldom do I run into a True professional. He's a great asset to the company, an upbeat and genuine person, and even has a passion for magic. Not kidding... homeboy just showed me some David Blaine card tricks.

I'd have been fine ordering inside and serving ourselves sitting outside but we weren't given any options.  It seems like a poor business choice to not only show a fight on a FRIDAY, St Patrick's Day weekend, knowing people will stay for hours, but not schedule staffing so the patio can be utilized by patrons...I thought this was RESTAURANT?!? There also isn't ANYWHERE to sit inside while waiting for a table or waiting for a to-go order.  Super bummed because I've always wanted to try this place but I'm not going to beg for a seat and a menu if they don't want my patronage.",

    "text": "So I just came here a second time.  Which maybe I shouldn't have because the first time was wonderful. I had great service.. the manager (jared) was amazing and I loved that I could bring my dog.   I came tonight and it was the complete opposite.  I had suggested this to my brother ans multiple friends who I haven't seen for months.  Our food wasn't served at the same time and my boyfriends nachos served cold.  We then bought drinks which we were not told is not on the menu and the ingredients charged seperately... and charged $12 per drink ($6 for a fireball shot inside of my angry orchard) (that same shot is in another specialty drunk with ice cream for $8.00 total).  Charged full price for the shot and full price for the beer.  It was not explained to us this was the case.  We did not check if it was on the menu we just knew what we wanted.  The absolute worst part of our service was the manager Brent. As I work in the staffing industry I have to say it's upsetting there are so many beter customer service driven individuals who could have done his job better than him in their sleep. It's upsetting someone like this makes a good wage while others are over looked.  As we explained to him how upsetting it was that I didn't get to have a meal with my family all at the same time and how the drinks were served at a completely unfair price without any explination as to why he just repeated \"I apologize for that\". He then told us we should have sent our food back and told them not to make new food if we wanted it adjusted off of our bill....  (we came there to eat.. so we were all hungry and expecting food; hot and at the same time..) he apologized in such a fake uncaring way I couldn't believe it.  We were given free appetizer cards for \"the next time we come\"  (durring happy hour) as if this service would bring in future customers.  We were then told they close at 12 every Friday even though the door states two \"The door wouldnt state 2... we never stay open that late\".... funny... I have a picture of the doors tonight... they close at \"2\" on fridays.  The waitress later told us that they close early everynight because no one is there.... hmmm... wonder why.   This guy's doesn't seem to know anything about customer service or management and because of him I (nor my family)  will never come to this location again.  I will also be contacting corporate with an official complaint.",
