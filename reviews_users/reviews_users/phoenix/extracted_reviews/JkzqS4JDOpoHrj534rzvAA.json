So glad we did, it's a great place. They have now moved to a larger location on Van Buren & 15th Ave. Love it even more! Very nice and clean and all the food is great, whether American, Mexican or Chinese. Drinks are just a tasty. Quick service and the staff is very attentive.  You want a tasty meal then stop in at IHOF! Tali, thank you for your great service today!   One happy customer, Maricela A.",

Fruit water of the day was watermelon and blended to order so I was even more stoked that I stopped in to eat here for the first time.     I will be coming back. Service was excellent and almost full service, you just pay at the register at the end. Inside was very clean and though minimal decor, a large mural spanning two inside walls gave the place some personality.    Outside lacks curb appeal, but the area is safe (I live 2 blocks away) and seeing it so much it's quirkiness has grown on me. I get that it's a breakfast/lunch place, but only thing I'd change is to be open later. I'd love to come for dinner but closing at 6pm is too early for me!",

The waffle was a little more like a pancake than a waffle but tastes fine and the eggs, chorizo, cheese and tortillas were really good.

I can't be more thankful that this place is within walking distance of my house as every time I've eaten here the food has been delicious. I've yet to try the Chinese options, but all of the American diner-style food has never left me anything but satisfied.   The True stars of the menu thus far, however, have been the Mexican options. For my most recent visit I had the huaraches with the al pastor meat. Numerous flavors and an adequate amount of food make this a darn near perfect dish.   There's a sick mural inside, it's a small operation run by genuine people, and it's a neighborhood spot, so I'd encourage anyone and everyone to give them a shot because businesses like this one are what we need more of.",

The best part was the fries by far. The carne asada was rubbery, the guacamole bland, the whole ensemble wasn't worth it's original components.   \"Well, it's not a item that usually highlights a restaurant's cuisine\" I said. So I tried again.  This time I ordered a carne asada burrito and some al pastor street tacos. Again I was disappointed. I ordered the burrito with cheese and pico de gallo. The tortilla was cold and bland. Again the carne asada was uninspiring. The cheese that was added was cold, shredded  that had been sloppily sprinkled on.   The tacos were good. Plenty of meat and onions. Good, quality tacos.  I might come again just because of the proximity to work and try something on the Chinese portion of the menu.",

Normally I love my coffee with breakfast but I was intrigued, so of course I had to try. Delish! I got onshore which came out as a little ready of sunshine with an umbrella in it. Didn't miss my coffee at all. Definitely a great morning stop especially if you are sick of the. Restaurants that get high ratings because they are trendy (been to way too many disappointments that way) I think the only down side is there really isn't much decor and from the outside it is not eye catching, but that's about it.",

We had carne asada huaraches, and a chorizo breakfast burrito. The hurraches were so flavorful and not something you can find anywhere. Highly recommend them. They also put hash browns in the breakfast burritos and that was delicious as well. We also had a strawberry and a watermelon fruit water. They are not overly sweet and very refreshing. Prices are great. I can't want to go back!",

Chips AND salsa are made fresh and chips are served hot. My dining companion had street tacos of various kinds and all three were delicious! Served with traditional style beans and rice - the beans are SO good! Loved the rice too! This is nice light Mexican fare - no gut bombs!  We saw the burgers delivered to a nearby table and they looked great too! Can't wait to return and try Chinese and breakfast items!!",

I got the dan dan noodles which legit was like a mix of jjajangmyeon and dan dan noodles but it was so good. I got a watermelon agua fresca which was really good too to wash down the noodles. My buddy got pad Thai and tacos since it was taco Tuesday and the pad Thai isn't authentic tasting or whatever but I really liked it and the spice level it came with. It's hard to pinpoint but it's like the chef learned a bunch of recipes and opened up his own spot with all his experiences or something. Definitely going to go out of my way to try some more of their dishes for sure. The location is easy to find but I missed it at first because I was looking for a spot to turn in.",

    "text": "IHOF.  The acronym just sounds too cheesy, too ripe for mockery, too easily dismissed as a lazy knockoff of IHOP (International House of Pancakes for those living under a rock).  And indeed if you were to drive by this old and not necessarily attractive looking building on 9th Avenue and Van Buren, you might well expect that your deepest suspicions about this concept would undoubtedly be confirmed.  And yet, with glowing reviews from the Phoenix New Times and lots of early Yelper buzz, it would seem there's more to IHOF's story than it's cover.  Hungry for a hearty breakfast early on a Saturday morning, IHOF's 6am opening time is a rare Downtown Phoenix commodity on the weekend.  So it was off to IHOF for my latest culinary exploration.  What the exterior lacks in charm, the comfortable, clean, and pleasantly outfitted interior more than makes up for.  The interior restaurant offers seating for upwards of 50 inside.  There's also  shaded patio seating along Van Buren outside for at least 10 more (a quick note: if you sit outside you'll be hit with the smell of bread consistently due to being located downwind from the local Bimbo bakery right next door).  The interior includes a beautifully painted mural on the wall and even some fun handmade centerpieces at each table.  I grabbed a seat in the corner and the friendly waitress (didn't catch her name) took care of me this morning.  As other descriptions of this place suggest, its a wide mix of foods here.  American, Mexican, and Chinese dishes can all be found on the menu.  The breakfast menu specifically is limited to just traditional American and Mexican breakfast fare.  For my breakfast this go around I decided on an American breakfast with a Mexican drink.  My drink was a licuado de platano (or a banana milkshake).  Came in a GIANT glass and was topped with a healthy chunk of cinnamon on top.  Really awesome drink I must say.  I recommend stirring the cinnamon around a bit to get an even dispersal, but a nice light smooth and refreshing concoction for any time of the day.  For my breakfast itself, I went with the Big Combo.  Two eggs (scrambled with cheese in my case), two bacon, two sausage links, two pancakes, and hash browns.  Simple, straight forward American breakfast.  I was particularly happy with the amount of cheese they gave me with my eggs, and the sausage was tasty too.  Kind of wished the pancakes were a little bigger, but the overall portion was plenty to satisfy me.  Overall, a solid breakfast.  Total for the breakfast, drink, tax and tip came to about $15.  Good value and good portions and the waitress was very attentive and friendly from the get go.  The breakfast itself didn't knock my socks off, but the licuado was fantastic.  I'd drink that anytime any day.  Across the board, the menu here at IHOF is super affordable with every item being $10 or less.  You can also order large party trays of many of the items they serve on their everyday menu.  So okay, the IHOF name might lack creativity or originality.  But as long as their friendly staff can whip up a tasty inexpensive meal every time I visit, I promise I'll keep the snarky comments to myself.",

    "text": "Seriously...I have told everyone who will listen how amazing this place is. Like a dummy, I thought that I wanted Chinese food on Saturday night, only to walk into a local Chinese place packed to the brim because it was Chinese New Year. Oops. Turned around and left. We got in the car and pulled up yelp when IHOF popped up. Thought, \"what the hell\" and decided to take a chance. BEST.DECISION.EVER.  When we pulled into the parking lot around 7pm, there was only one other car there. We went inside and were greeted by Jose right away. He told us to have a seat anywhere we wanted and brought us a couple menus and drinks. When he came back, I asked what he recommended and he had something for each section of the menu. Like I said, I had a Chinese craving but when I am presented with Mexican food, that's what I always end up ordering. I ordered the Carne Asada Fries (I know...not the most authentic thing on the menu but it sounded really good) with a side of beans and rice. My lovely date had the Huaraches - half carne aside, half abobada.   Carne Asada Fries....these fries were perfectly seasoned and were crisp the whole time. They were still fluffy on the inside, not dried out from over frying. The meat was delicious and there was a lot of it...topped with cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. Hot sauce on the side. It was so good. The serving was huge and I ate just about all of it. The Huaraches are a signature dish...two gorditas stuffed with beans, topped with red and green sauce meat of your choice, onion, cilantro, cojita cheese. I had one bite....also delicious!  As we were waiting for our food, another family came in and ordered Chinese food. Although my food was awesome, as soon as theirs came out I instantly regretted my decision. Should have gone with my gut, but that's what multiple visits are for. In fact, as I sit writing this I am defrosting chicken to make for dinner tonight but I am going to throw it back in the fridge and go back to IHOF tonight. Bye!   **Oh sorry, I need to add, the dining area is super clean and when we paid we checked out the kitchen and that is equally as clean, yet very small. Great job IHOF!",

The service and prep was fast (under 10 minutes from ordering to delivery) and Jessica (one of the two servers that are currently busting out a lunch crowd) was personable and polite.

There was a solid brick of some white cheese in the middle of a cold, lifeless 'relleno' that was coated in sawdust. This delight was topped with a watery, nasty red sauce. The 'beans and rice' that this $10 meal comes with are hard, grainy pieces of rice with beans so watery they could pass for bean soup. Everything was ice cold. After calling the restaurant and speaking with 'Jose,' he reiterated several times that they were 'unaware that their food went out that way.' When I said 'Don't you prepare the actual food?' He did not have a response. Worst $10 I ever spent... strongly advise you if you seek good, quality food that is prepared fairly according to menu description and delivered hot - seek it elsewhere.",

Most of us had breakfast, I had lunch and some had combinations of both. They supposedly don't do gluten free but the one in our party whom it mattered to they worked with to change some ingredients around.  This is not gourmet food.  But it is well cooked basic stuff, and easy on the pocket book. With a large group somebody is bound to have a food complaint, every plate was cleaned. All the staff we dealt with were pleasant.  So maybe the neighborhood is not where you would expect to find good food at a good price but I would not hesitate to go here again.",

People definitely hype this place up, but personally the only thing to hype up is that they have Mexican, Japanese, and American food. That is pretty neat, but I feel like this is something that would be better late night after having hit the bars.   Also, I might change the stars on the review after I've tried their breakfast, which is apparently their main course. It's available all day, so maybe I've been the dumb one for not trying it!",

    "text": "I got to give this place 5 stars just solely on the customer service provided by our server Michelle. She was very talkative and nice with me and my girl and our 8 month old daughter. She explained the menu to us and changed things up for us when we didn't like something. I had the cheese enchiladas which came with 6 small enchiladas and rice and beans. Michelle switched up the beans to peruano beans for me which was their vegetarian alternative to the refried beans that come with lard that they tend to serve with all their dishes. I guess the food was alright. I just wish it came in a bigger portion. I kind of felt like I was eating a kids meal. I left hungry and I didn't like how there was barely any cheese in the enchiladas. I did like their churros with ice cream and whip cream, it came with 4 hot and fresh churros. I guess next time I'll try a different dish that comes with more food. I'll give this place another chance just cause of how great Michelle was. She deserves a raise or a management position. If you want a clean restaurant with excellent customer service and don't want to get full then this is the spot for you. Honestly it is worth coming here just for the service alone. It kind of makes up for the small portion of food that they give you.",

    "text": "I will admit I drove by and judged a book by it's cover. The voices in my head were like a restaurant that serves American, Asian and Mexican how could they get it right? After countless passing's to and from work I noticed that the parking lot was not shy of customers. I then decided to take the daring approach and give them a try. All I can say is a major lesson has been learned. I have missed out on this hidden gem for a long time.   There motto is correct \"International House of Food, where the real flavor lives.\" I was raised on home cooked authentic food. So I know good food when I see and taste it. This family operated establishment offers a variety of genuine real home cooked meals. What is impressive is they can get it right now matter what cuisine you feel like. With breakfast, lunch and dinner served all day no matter who you dine with will be happy. To top it off the price point is reasonable. Better than some of the go to chain restaurants.   So let's get to the good stuff. I would like to start of by saying I have witness and experienced some of the best customer service. Each person who works there is happy. One big happy family that they make you feel apart of. All smiles and they never miss a beat. The restaurant is so organize on the process of great customer service it makes you not want to visit a big chain restaurant.  Your immediately greeted from the moment you step foot in the door. Feel free to seat yourself to a table that has the silverware on it. The menu caters to all taste buds and dietary needs including kids. In reviewing it you will see there are options for everyone. Their food is never pre-made. Cooked to order so it comes out hot and fresh. You see the cooks hard at work having fun in the kitchen while you wait for your food.  The most difficult part in dining here is to figure what your going to have as the tasty options make you want to order it all. I highly recommend as seen in the picture is to order a Fruit Water to help wash down your food. I have been hooked on the Watermelon Water since day one. Comes in what appears to be a Margarita Glass but trust me their is no liquor. It is garnished with a lovely piece of fruit.   I recently dined with a friend who wanted lettuce wraps and hash browns during lunch. It was nice she could have both breakfast and lunch at the same time.  There really has never been a disappointment moment I have experienced. If I could give more than \"5\" stars I would. I highly recommend you at least try this place once as I know you will be back.  Some Key Points:  They have a catering menu  If you don't like something in a dish tell them to keep it out. Everything is made to order. Plenty of Parking Long hours daily so you can come a couple times a day. lol Smaller restaurant but they have you in and out. I have never had to wait during lunch",

The dish I ordered was the Hawaiian Fire Chicken. I opt for the fried rice with it. The dish looked amazing. After trying the dish, I was not impressed with the flavor. I also thought, especially for a first visit, that the waitress could have came by at least once and asked me how was my meal or at the least knew about the 10% Yelp check-in deal. The dish did not wow me and the soda was not tasty & strong. In conclusion, this meal with added drink, should not have cost nearly $15. I may return. But, if I do, it won't be for any of the Asian dishes. Let's leave that to Asian Restaurants to do.... CHEERS!!",

Last time I went, I was starving and feeling a lot of different cravings. I ended up getting a side of hashbrowns and the Hawaiian fire chicken. Not a combo you can get anywhere else that I'm aware of, and the waitress was kind enough not to give me a weird look. The hashbrowns weren't  crispy, but it hit the spot. The fire chicken had a nice flavor, but it was nothing special. My s/o got something off the Mexican portion of the menu, which he really enjoyed. We also saw these ladies get salads that were HUGE and very intriguing.   The place is large and clean, and tables are nicely spaced out. It seemed like quite a number of people were there with coworkers, some even seemed to be in a lunch meeting. The service was also pretty fast--i was able to get in and out in about 35 minutes. They also have a private parking lot with ample spaces.    Definitely a good place to go if you're in a larger group and want everybody to be happy! Plus, breakfast is served all day :)",

He noticed we were catching up and told us to take our time even though they were now closed. After we finally realized he was closing up, we got up to pay. We went outside and chatted for another hour or so and on their way out, the cooks who made our food thanked us and wished us a goodnight. If I lived in the area I would visit IHOF frequently.",

    "text": "Today is super cold and rainy and my friend and I did not want to venture outside of work for lunch but the reviews for this place were too good to ignore. The inside is small and kind of crowded with tables but very clean. It's very casual so you can just pick a seat if you are dining in or you can go to the register for take out. We were greeted before we even sat down and ordered drinks right away, they were back in no time and we ordered our food. I got the chicken lo mein and a spring roll and she had the orange chicken and friend rice on the side. Both came surprisingly fast, which is perfect because we only had about 30 min to eat and get back to work. The noodles are home made and the veggies were fresh and not over cooked. I loved that the sauce wasn't overly sweet/salty or sticky like most places. My friends chicken and rice plate was enough to feed two! I couldnt resist stealing a few pieces of her chicken, great flavor and crispy. I'd say the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the tables are a little crowded and the noise of all the cooking going on was hard to keep a conversation at times, but we did sit right against the prep wall near the door to the outdoor patio. Next time, and there will be many, we will just sit outside or on he other side.",

So we pull up, this is our first time here and I was excited. There was only one other family in the restaurant and were immediately greeted by our server Cruz, she was very friendly. I ordered the huaraches, my husband ordered the orange chicken and my kids ordered a meat lovers breakfast and bean and cheese tostadas. We also ordered 4 of the fresh juice drinks. The food came out and I would say it was a nice portion of food. Although the food was not great. It was good but not great. The orange chicken felt like it was straight out of a frozen bag. The huaraches were ok, a little bland in flavor I had to dump a bunch of sauce on it to taste something and it felt as though the beans were dry but a plus was that the carne asada was soft. I didn't get to try out the bean tostadas but my daughter seemed to enjoy them. I did try out the pancakes which those were good. Overall I don't think I will be back, to me $55 was way to expensive. We like to eat out and we have eaten at plenty of other restaurants for less than that.",

It's located right next to the Bimbo bread factory when I got out of the car it smelt like fresh baked goodness.  Going inside the decor was what I expected for a Chinese American Mexican restaurant. Service was rather friendly, but that's where all things good end. We ordered a waffle combo and biscuits and gravy. I should have thought twice about ordering food after constantly hearing the microwave alarm sound. The food was lame, not bad, but really disappointing. Maybe something you'd expect at a truck stop diner. Throughout our meal I probably heard the microwave alarm go off about 20 times even though there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I was baffled.  On the way out I got what they called a pineapple fruit water, which really is a Mexican agua de pina. It was well done, fresh made and quite delicious. If I'm going to go back I would give the Mexican food a try, although I wouldn't be surprised if it is just microwave cuisine.",

They tasted like those frozen pancakes thrown into the microwave and served on a plate. This is after I had asked while ordering if the pancakes are made fresh!! They won't have told me that they aren't! Oh well! Hubby got the breakfast burrito and it was very average, definitely smaller than what we have had before at other places.

The substitutions and extras are also not worth it. Got the fried rice instead of white ($1.25 more) which had no flavor so there's no point in the substitute unless you're really keen on a lil crunch from pieces of carrot. Also got a side of pico de gallo (only .75 more but the saddest pico I've ever seen) was very dry and 80% cilantro. The front dining area had a faint smell of dirty mop which is very unsettling while trying to eat your food. The service was fine, but definitely won't be returning.",

    "text": "Recently catered from here for about 40 people, & Juan took really good care of us. We came from out of town (CA) for a week long ballet festival at the Phoenix Convention Center. We had their Chinese food & everything was fresh & tasty. A big hit amongst our group! I was so pleased that I ordered their catering for a 2nd night & decided to try their Mexican food as well. An ample amount of food at a very reasonable price. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, was that to me, the food was not as authentic as you could get from a more ethnically focused restaurant. I'm a Chinese lady from Southern CA, who knows what authentic Chinese & authentic Mexican food is like. But I figure that for catering purposes, dishes needed to be adjusted for being able to feed the masses. The Chinese food was comparable to what you would get at a Panda Express, not from Chinatown. And the Mexican food was not like any Mexican I had ever had before (except the rice & beans were pretty standard). But all that to say, everything was still very tasty & satisfied our hungry dancers to a T.",

Authentic fare, excellent prices, and good service is what you will find inside this hidden gem.  International House of Food is a no frills restaurant but it is squeeky clean and serves tasty dishes.  The owners work the counter and they are gracious and welcoming.  International House of food serves Breakfast, Chinese, and Mexican entrees it might sound like an odd collection of food but somehow it works. I was impressed with the Al pastor tacos. The meat was tender and flavorful and the tacos had a nice taste.  I have also tried many items on the breakfast menu such as a pancakes, french toast, eggs, and fried potatoes and all were very tadty. However, I think one of my favorites is a club sandwich with onion rings.   Great service, competitive pricing, and tasty food, it doesn't get any better than that.",

Very fresh, very tasteful (I could have used a bit more spicyness but that's where adding hot salsa helped). The coffee was delicious, enough to drink black.   The atmosphere, super clean!

I must confess, as other Yelper's have previously stated, I too was not so sure based on the outer appearance and the name BUT, do NOT let those things turn you off from the Friendliest, most Attentive (without being overbearing), and Warm customer service and the delicious menu!  We decided, after reading many Glowing reviews, to try it out today. Loved hearing our worship leader, BJ Putnam's song playing as we walked in the door! Cruz was our server and she was very patient with us while we were trying to decide what to order and then changing our minds. She was happy to answer our questions about various menu items too!  We ended up ordering burgers, Bacon Cheeseburger for me, and Guacamole Bacon for my roommate. They were flavorful, moist, and delicous. Since we could not choose between fries and onion rings we asked for half and half. Cruz was very sweet and smiled while we peppered her with questions and tried to make our final choices. For drinks we ordered the Pineapple Aqua Fresca - made to order with Fresh pineapple, and a silky Strawberry/Banana smoothie. Both were the perfect amount of sweetness. We finished our meal with an order of churros that we shared - Perfect!  We met Juan and Jose who are mentioned in other reviews. Juan owns the business with his family and was genuinely warm and friendly. He sat us at our table, checked on us a couple of times during our meal and cashed us out when we were finished! Incredibly kind, warm and gracious people!  We have already planned our return trip to try their Asian and Mexican fares.",

We were seated right away and they have plenty of seating with an extra room for meetings, etc.    They offer American, Mexican and Asian food which was fun because we could order a variety without changing restaurants   I ordered the Kung Pao chicken. The portion size was adequate with plenty of chicken. The sauce was good, not too much but enough to cover the chicken.  There is a charge for fried rice in place of white but it is worth it. The fried rice is delicious.  The other two in our party ordered the monster burger and both liked the taste and size of the burger. French fries were good for one burger and a salad was substituted for the other side with the other burger. Nothing fancy just lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion. They only have three dressings; ranch, honey mustard and balsamic.  I especially appreciated the music selection. You don't hear modern Christian music in an establishment very often.    The manager came around to check on our orders and Jose was very attentive without being intrusive.  When I'm in the area again I'd love to try one of their Mexican selections as well",

The person who ordered chicken fingers couldn't even eat them. The server seemed very confused when I asked for a plain cheeseburger. I had to explain what plain meant, meat cheese and bun. The food was a fairly normal pricing- about 11bucks for a meal. I heard they recently moved locations, and I don't know how long ago that was because it almost looks like a fake restaurant. It looks kind of unfinished. I'm still very confused. I'm giving it 2 stars though because the server was still nice.",

My coworker had a dish we had never seen before, potato gortia like long patties covered in sauce cheese and chunk of carne asada. ~7.50 which he did enjoy.  My one grip with this place is the price. With tax and tip meals are close to $10 and I would like it to be just a buck or so less for lunch pricing or have a pei wei like format so I did not need to tip.",

We both give 5 stars for the meals.  Portions are very generous.    A unique side option is you can order a pork chop ($1.99) as an additional side to your entree... haha, just love that option.

It's about 1.5-2 miles from the stadium and it serves American, Chinese,  and Mexican food. Dafaq?!!  We had to check it out. Got there around 10:15. We ordered the watermelon water,  orange chicken,  and French toast combo.  Everything was really,  really tasty. The watermelon water was made fresh to order and it had just the right consistency and sweetness. The orange chicken was crispy, crunchy and juicy without being mushy and sickly sweet. The French toast was also perfect. For a total of $22, it was great deal for the amount of food and the taste.  The service was awesome too!  The lady (can't remember her name) was fast,  friendly,  and helpful.  Next time I'm in the area,  I'm definetely going back here!",

Nothing less.  1) I order the same thing every time because its a magical bowl of magic aka Chicken Fried Rice *chicken extra crispy. Its LITERALLY the best fried rice one can ever consume- i can tell by the utter satisfaction my belly feels when i eat the ungodly serving size they give you. Get a side of fried egg o/m to really feel the magic.  2) Watermelon Water- I'm not gonna get into it- if you're near 10th (ish) Ave and Van Buren, stop what you're doing and go get some. I don't care if you don't like watermelon, just go get some and give it to someone you know so they can tell you how magical it is. This is obviously a test of faith to you non-believers. Go forth and enjoy!  3) This thing people call \"customer service\". I thought it was a rumor until i went to the IHOF- see what i did there? Anyhoo, it was amazing. From the gal at the register, Janet, to the magicians hovering over the cooking flames in the very open kitchen, EVERYONE was super willing and flexible with my ridiculous diva-esque requests. Picky eater? who cares (this may not be accurate)!! They could probably tell you NO and have you walk out of there feeling like your shit don't stink. They have never made me feel silly or unwelcome.  Thanks IHOF- for keeping it real. Maybe ill eat something different one day- probably not though. stay classy.",

It is definitely a hidden gem. Today I tried the orange chicken with the fried rice and a spring roll. The orange chicken was mild just the way I like it.  For dessert I tried the fried churros with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. All I could say is OMG! It was AMAZING! The churros were hot and crunchy with a vanilla cream filling. Wish I could come back but I'm just visiting from Chicago. Just wanted to leave the restaurant and staff a well deserved, pleasant review.",

First off, Jose was very nice and had excellent customer service he made great suggestions and never denied any of my request like adding a fried egg to my bacon cheeseburger. Jose suggested an Agua Fresca and I went with the strawberry flavor and I was surprised to see him making it hand made with a blender behind me. I was so impressed with the flavors of the food and beverage. I will definitely be back to support this local family owned food spot!",

My boyfriend and I decided to come and try it out. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a friendly host who asked us how many and where we would like to sit. We came right around lunch time and it was pretty busy. Our server immediately greeted us with a friendly smile and promptly took our beverage orders. We placed our orders. I had the big breakfast with pancakes and my boyfriend had the Mexican street tacos. I must say I have never been to a restaurant that serves American, Mexican, and Chinese cuisine all out of one kitchen. Our food arrived 15 minutes later and was exceptional. We came back two days later and the results were the same!! A little unexpected for downtown Phoenix in terms service. As a person who is in hospitality myself I will highly recommend IHOF. Job well done and I can't wait to come back.",

The Mexican selection is where they shine but their American \"diner\" items are good too. I have not tried their Asian offerings. Parking is in a partially fenced in lot. There are a number of transients in the area but I have never had any issues with any of them. They also do catering and have a private dining room.",

Our younger boys had orange chicken, it was crispy and delicious. The fried rice was good and filled with fresh vegetables.  My husband had breakfast for dinner. He had the French toast, scrambled eggs (with cheese), bacon that melted in his mouth and hash browns that were perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside. He declared this place his new breakfast go-to!! The aquas frescas were delicious but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish them!

I had the huaraches, which is basically a flat, fried gordita covered in beans, asada, onions and cilantro--it was awesome! The pineapple water was fresh and scrumptious. The staff Juan and Sarah were so friendly and they definitely take pride in this place. Try it and be pleased.",

Can't really call them an IHOP or Denny's since they also serve a more authentic selection of Mexican food. Asked the waiter if everything on the menu is up for grabs at whatever time of the day, and his response was, \"yes\". Hooray!!! American, Chinese, Mexican. Breakfast items as well. Yummy! My husband had a meat and veggie loaded omelet and loved it. I had pancakes, poached eggs, fruit, and sausage. Pancakes left something to be desired. Tasted store bought but okay. Wish they could spice the pancakes up a bit with diff toppings or flavors. Friendly staff and good cheap food. Will def come again to check out their Chinese and Mexican dishes.",

The food was hot when the buffet line opened and the flavors just as good as in the restaurant. The food was so reasonably priced (under $2000) and all our guests raved about how good it was. The owner Juan is the most kind and patient man. He was easy to stay in touch with  and helped along the way, even helping to calm this nervous bride :) He was NEVER pushy about selling us what we didn't need or didn't want. He made sure to support us in all our decisions and helped us make sure there was more than enough food for our guests to enjoy. His staff was even willing to help cut all our cake for the reception. They go above and beyond any other restaurant in regard to affordability, flavor, kindness, and professionalism. I encourage any bride who want DELICIOUS, affordable food to call Juan and the international house of food, they made our wedding so special!!! Thanks to Juan and all your wonderful staff!!!! We can't thank you enough!!!",

First of all there was almost no cheese anyway. Second, the burrito was 4 inches long, at the most. I asked for no rice and they put it in anyway. When I called to inform them they said they were sure they didn't add any but if they did they would take the burrito back and bring me another. My fiance ordered their orange chicken and she got more carrots in it than chicken. Her iced tea tasted like water and they didn't bring any sugar. I suggest not ordering from them unless you like to gamble with your meals and hard earned money.",

Once inside, the I found it to be very family friendly and the servers and cooks are very kind. I was in the mood for Chinese, and ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. Soo good! I cut the pieces of crispy chicken with one stroke with my fork. They were juicy and so fresh. The sauce is very good- and the rice was delicious. I will be coming here more often, and plan to bring kids- I can order Chinese for me and burgers for them! The only thing, is it closes by six- So plan to go before then.",

Janet was our server and super friendly and helpful, and everyone else working was also so very nice. I really liked the International Appetizer, which included egg rolls, chicken tenders, onion rings and french fries. It was hard to decide what to eat since everything on the menu looked so good and there's such an assorted genre of food to choose from. I will definitely be back! And they deliver within 3 miles of the restaurant, so it's good for a night in too.",
