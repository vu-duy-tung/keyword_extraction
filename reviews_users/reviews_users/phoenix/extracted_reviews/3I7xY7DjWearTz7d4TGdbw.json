The margaritas are so good, and we would always get the border chimichangas (beef). The staff were always so friendly and if you sit at the bar, you feel like you're around friends. They need to add a location in the north valley!",

So I've found a few things I can tolerate as long as I have lots of margaritas to go with it!  So Teresa took care of me first with a large frozen one, and my wife had two on the rocks with her meal.  We finally made it to our western destination, which was Chandler, and were glorying in our arrival.  I had nachos with jalapenos, green onions and shredded chicken covered in white cheese sauce.  My wife went for the more traditional pollo rico, a chicken burrito with cheese sauce served with rice and beans, as usual.  A very nice welcome to two weeks in Chandler!",

That was huge too. The staff is friendly, the owner very nice and the food orders come out fast. I am a regular,only Mexican restaurant I like.",

This experience, however... NOT GOOD! I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE.  First off, there was dried food in my water glass.  My co-worker who sat next to me had something stuck to his fork, so he exchanged it out for different silverware and the new set had cheese still attached to the knife. I was repulsed. We got our food and I ordered chimichangas.  They were gross!  The ground beef on the inside was tasteless, not even salt or pepper... nothing.  When I cut it open water, grease, or some liquid poured out.  I can't believe that someone would serve that quality of food and charge the prices they were charging. I will not eat here again even if it is a work lunch and is paid for.  I would rather fill up on chips and salsa and not even order a main entree.",

To sum up my experience of this place - they seem to favor quantity over quality. Huge bowl of chips and salsa - which was just unnecessary for two people. Huge plate portions and everything seemed to come out a little \"too fast\" - as in everything pre-made and re-warmed before serving and then topped with copious amounts of sauce and cheese to compensate. I noticed that the neighboring tables turned very quickly. Almost like at a fast food joint. People didn't seem to be there for spending quality time with each other - just eat and go.   I must say - the food didn't taste bad. It just seemed very over-crowded and impersonal and not very noteworthy.   I haven't been back since because it just wasn't a great experience and there are other restaurants in the same shopping plaza that do a better job overall.",

We have always had good service and good food, however my visit this evening was anything but good.  I was dining alone and sat at a table in the bar.  The server took my order, brought my beer, and that was the last time I saw him. Somebody else brought my meal, which was fine, but nobody ever came back to check if I needed anything and when I was finished, I waited 20 minutes before I requested my check and a box from the hostess, who could not have been less interested. She was far more interested in chatting with the other hostess and acted totally put off by my request. I would guess that my immediate and extended family spends close to $1500 a month at Nando's, and because they are regulars have always been treated well.  Not the case tonight for me. Very disappointed that I was made to feel so unwelcome.",

Topped with guacamole, sour cream, cheese and green onions. Served with rice and beans. $14.50. The Chimi was dry, a glob of tasteless guac on top, dollop of sour cream and dry chicken inside. My fare was Alfredo's Green Chile Pork ~ A plate of tender pork simmered in a spicy Hatch green chile sauce. Topped with Monterey Jack cheese and served with rice, beans and flour tortillas. $11.50. The plate was 90% beans and rice, the tender pork consisted of maybe 6 to 8 pieces the size of Lima beans, covered with pico to mask the portion size.  I tasted one of the pieces of pork and it was tolerable, but while searching for it's companions, i decide to return it to the kitchen and chose to forgo a replacement, ate my chewy and bland tortillas that tasted as tho they had been microwaved before being placed in the foil. The Manager came to the table to apologize and advised that he had admonished the kitchen on the amount of protein; and suggested that it may have be the \"end of the portions\", not exactly what i wanted to hear as an apology. We will be looking for other options for our Mexican Fare, to bad.",

Wait staff very friendly (with one exception) and service is fast.  Value is excellent.  Many lunch specials for $8.95 which includes rice and beans - and chips and salsa to start.  Each time, I've only been able to eat about 1/2  of my entree and taken the rest home.    The only negative is that we showed up for lunch and the hostess didn't bother to come to her podium for almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Then, when she did, she was not friendly at all - actually seemed put out that she had to attend to seating us... once to the table, she dropped the menus on the table and left without a word.  She clearly doesn't like her job.  Very strange, since everyone else I've encountered at the restaurant has been more than friendly.  So, memo to the restaurant manager: replace your lunchtime hostess.  It's the first impression people get of your restaurant and you probably don't want that impression to be one of rudeness.  Also, they have a large outdoor patio. Overall I enjoy this restaurant and will go back.",

I just like to say this, each plate was huge and not filled with easy fillers , I mean they really give you a meal. Also additional boost the night we went they gave part of each sell to the honor society to help kids travel for education trip so credit to you. Great place and must try.",

All were excellent with the exception of the tostada which had already sogged through the tortilla when it came to me. Flavor was great and I ate it with a fork.  The only reason that the I did not give 5 stars was the music.  They were blaring Elton John the whole time.  Such great efforts were made to give the place a wonderful atmosphere it was so disappointing that the music was so distracting.  Some light mariachi music or even spanish guitar would have added to the experience.  Don't want to hear Tiny Dancer at volume 11 while I enjoy my taco.",

    "text": "Having just moved from California, I found myself on a quest from Mexican food in the chandler area. Entering Nando's I was immediately impressed with the ambiance that's reminiscent of a Mexican cantina designed in Disney land.   Unfortunately, first impressions were not an accurate representation of the quality of the food. The salsa was  mediocre and the chicken in my tacos was completely over slated, making the beans and rice the star of my plate.   All in all, if you solely gauge your eatery by its ornamental value, this would be a good venue for you.",

Now I have been to their other location so I was kind of excited to see this new place, I like the set up, We sat at the tables behind the bar, but it didn't feel like we were in the bar area, there was a huge tree/branch like divider separating the two area, and I thought the tree was cool. We arrived around 6:30isna and there was no wait, we were seated right away.  We ate our chips & the hot sauce disappeared, so I asked our server if we could get some more of the hot, and she asked if we like spicy things, and I said heck yea, and she then brought us out this habanero hot sauce, omg that stuff was amazing, it was spicy, smoky, and flavorful, now that I know they have that I will be requesting it all the time!  I ordered the Pollo Rico, it was cooked perfectly and tasted delish! And topped with that habanero hot sauce ooohhhh weeeee baby that was good!  I did go with the intentions of ordering some deep fried ice cream, it seems to be my latest craving that I can't get enough of, and well my dinner filled me up and I wasn't hungry anymore, so I never got it, but that just means I have to order it the next time I am there and believe me I will be back! Service was great and food was delish!",

    "text": "Monday was quite a day of day drinking and eating.  Mr. M & I had already hit two other places and then we decided to head much closer to home and try Nando's.  I've been curious since they started remodeling the place, and driving by at night the white lights on the patio & inside looked very inviting.  This location is exactly that:  inviting and even though the building is large, there are smaller rooms inside and the brick interior makes it feel cozy.  The staff could not be more friendly.  I think I saw everyone smiling which is always appreciated.  We started with 2 of the Cabo margs with curacao which were large and delicious.  The chips and salsa were good too.  I used to think I liked my salsa more like pico de gallo, but now I'm gettin' into the salsas that are more of a puree.  Nando's salsa had a very nice blend of flavors.  They gave us the mild/medium one, and then a small container of salsa they said was very spicy.  We're both a couple of heat pansies and didn't try that one, but it smelled good.  Then Mr. M had the Pollo Rico and I had the #10 which was with 2 beef flautas, black beans, and rice.  Now I know this isn't really authentic but both dishes were flavorful and enjoyable.  Both meats, the chicken in the Rico and the beef in my flautas were very tender.  As others have mentioned the portions are HUGE.  We left with mucho leftovers which I'm always happy to warm up the morning after and throw a fried egg on top of.  And I froze all the Spanish rice and will use that in a tex mex soup that I make.  I mentioned in another review today that I've been having major cravings for Mexican food lately and this place fit the bill.  I would definitely go back mainly because the atmosphere is so inviting and because it's a good value for the money.  They also do flights of tequila.  I will most definitely be back to try some of those.  Glad to see a Mexican joint within walking distance.  Or shuffling distance.",

We always sit at the bar and receive good service.    (I think the name of the bartender we normally see is Zane. and he always takes good care of us).    But this past Sunday, 3/22, we had a new bartender we had never seen before and service was awful.    We would have stayed longer if we could have gotten drinks when our glasses were empty.   It's like we were invisible.    In fairness to him he may have just been overwhelmed as he also served tables.   We ordered the nachos, which came fairly fast, but we had a hard time finding the chips and chicken under what seemed to be a 2 pound layer of cheese.     In fact there was so much cheese I had an upset stomach later in the day.    Unfortunately this is not the first time our meals have been buried under the cheese.....if we remember we always make sure to order food by saying \"light on the cheese please!\"  We really want to support Nandos as it is a beautiful venue with nice bar/patio.    But management needs to understand the importance of having a bartender with a \"personality\"......and first and foremost making sure the bar clientele is taken care of......drink glasses shouldn't stay empty for very long.    And the kitchen needs to cut way back on the cheese, as there are too many other Mexican options in the area.     I hope management understands this, otherwise we will eventually see another Chandler restaurant bite the dust.",

The patio is amazing, decorated with lights and wrought iron fencing. Very rustic and old world Mexico. Large pillars, tile work, stone and old wood everywhere. Great ambiance. But I do love the food! Not your typical combo #6 with beans and rice! They have fish tacos, pork verde and steak entrees. The appetizers, like the Mexican pizza, is enough for dinner! I like their nachos, piled high and loaded with fresh ingredients. I usally grab a taco plate of some kind. The carnitas are amazing! They have a great tequila selection and happy hour specials too. The bartender offered me up a sample of their habanero tequila. Which is just a blanco tequila in a large jar with habanero chilis! Ay Carumba!! Careful with this one kids! It's not meant to be  a shot! The servers are friendly but not the best or fastest I've had. The bartenders I know, Mike and Gary are very helpful and friendly. Overall nice place for good Mexican food where the chips, salsa and margaritas flow!",

Tia Rosa came and went quickly in this space.  I was so happy to see that Nando's was taking it over!  I had been to Nando's in Gilbert and loved it.  They did a wonderful job remodeling and adding a beautiful patio to the space.  There are big screen TVs great for watching sports in the bar and on the patio.  It has a cozy feel that Tia Rosa did not have.  Now for the food. I've been here a few times and each time they did not disappoint.  The Chips and Salsa are delicious.  Hot, fresh chips and tasty salsa.  I've had the Chicken Chimichanga and the Pollo Rico.  The chicken is moist and tender and both entrees did not skimp!  Rice and beans are good.  The rice is fluffy and moist.  The beans are a tad bland but then it's beans so what are you gonna do?  They have killer margaritas in many different version for every taste and a giant tequila list.  Nando's is in my top 2 for mexican.  If you have not tried it.....what are you waiting for??  Go....now....there is a margarita calling your name!",

However, i was in last week and my perception completely changed. The food was great and the employees were super nice and helpful. From the moment i walked in i was greeted by a young lady named Sydney I believe (hard to catch her name she was very busy). She was doing so much between helping with customers, cleaning off tables when she could find time, keeping the customers smiling and laughing as we were waiting to be seated it was really amazing to watch! Walking into a restaurant and the first thing you see is an employee going above and beyond even when management might not be looking is what makes a restaurant so successful. Between the food and great service I definitely plan on recommending this spot to family and friends.",

The chips and salsa were excellent as was the chimichanga I ordered. The portion size was great for the price and I ended up taking half of my meal home with me. Our service, however, was lacking. Our waiter only stopped by once to take our order, once to drop it off and once with the check. And the times in between were LONG. My sister had a margarita, so I figured he would be by more frequently at least to try to bank on selling her more drinks, but no. Once we finished our meal, we sat there for nearly 30 minutes waiting for him to come back. It was a Wednesday and the restaurant was completely empty inside, so while I'd like to say he was busy, I really can't say what he issue was. I'd go back for the food, though, because I'm sure it was just an off day for service.",

I simply couldn't eat another bite without adding hot sauce on them. The side dishes are average...nothing spectacular. The salsa....hmm...I've had better.   Service is great. Special kuddos to Busboys who are working tonight. They are so quick at delivering the salsa and chips as soon as we sat down. I also saw how hard they work throughout the night. The owner definitely did a good job hiring hard workers.   Overall, I think the food is ok....Im not sure if I will come back here again.",

We had planned to go to BLD but they don't take reservations and when we all arrived they were crazy busy with a long wait. So we went right across the parking lot and were seated immediately at Nando's. It was a beautiful day so we sat out on the patio and we all enjoyed ourselves.  I had been here before for dinner with my husband and I can't remember what we ordered but it was just ok so we never came back. I was a little more impressed with the breakfast. They had a good variety of both Mexican and traditional American items on the menu and everyone seemed pretty happy with their food. The prices were also very reasonable. My sisters kids were able to get pancakes that were on the menu as side dishes for just a few bucks and they were pretty happy.",

Food: Fantastic, I they greeted us with bottomless chips and salsa and a pitcher of water, then you order.  The food is ample, I don't reommend trying to eat it all as food coma may result.  The quality is great and very high quality. Cost: not bad at all, meal, soft drinks and desert was about  $40 for 2 people which is actually average in cost to other less desirable places in the area. Summary: We found a new place and will not only be back but recommend it to friends.  Great job to the team we dealt with, thank you.",

The Chips are thin and crispy , salsa is tasty both the medium and the hot are great. Service was on point , restaurant was clean , all of the staff we came in Contact with were helpful. I ordered way too much food because I didn't realize their portions were so generous. I was seriously able to take my leftovers home and make 2 more meals out of it. I had the thres ? It was a beef taco, chicken enchilada and green chili beef burrito. All of that for $14 . Man what a bargain. My husband had the steak tacos $14 and said they were amazing . He said that the meat was just like fajita meat and incredibly flavorful . They offer happy hour specials and kids eat free night. Plus they offer free kiddo dinners with good report cards . This place is very family friendly , and I appreciate finding a little gem like this .",

The server was friendly and somewhat attentive...until she had more than one table then it seemed like she was over sat making her service quality decline.  After trying the bland greasy food I was surprised at how busy it was here. I got a sample platter. My mini tacos were soggy, no freshness at all. The mini chimis were crunchy but had no flavor. The enchilada sauce was tasty, but again no flavor inside. The cheese was already congealed when it got to the table. The only good part were the refried beans...although it seemed as if the beans may have come from a can. The mini tostada was so soggy it couldn't be eaten. My meal was a disappointment. My husband said his was ok...he got the tacos he had to assemble himself. He did say there was no seasoning, but at least his were not all soggy. The overwhelmi g grease in the food however was stomach ache causing. The kids burger my 2yr old got was so over done and clearly from a frozen patty. She would not eat it. She only ate the bun.  They are also way over priced for the quality of their food. We won't be returning as there are so many actual amazing and delicious Mexican food places out there...this is beyond not worth it.",

    "text": "With so many restaurants to choose from in Chandler we very rarely visit the same one twice. However this was our third time at Nando's. The first time was during the Christmas Season rush and the place was slammed! Service was understandably slow but the food the excellent. The next time was a Sunday after church. Both the food and service was better than we could have expected.   Yesterday we decided to get takeout, which is a completely different experience with a different set of expectations. The girl who answered the phone was polite, professional and took my order with no hassle (good so far). As a rule, we expect the food to be slightly off par due to the cooling and shifting around that happens during transport. But when we opened the containers we found the food packed so tight that not so much as a grain of rice was out of place! And the food must have been piping hot when they packed it because it was the perfect temperature when I got it home. I got the Pollo Rico and my husband got the Sonoran Enchiladas. Our son got a cheese crisp (listed as an appetizer). It was put in a pizza box. They even included the chips and salsa, which we didn't eat until the next day because our dinners filled us up so much. All in all it was one of the best takeout experiences we ever had!",

Nevertheless, I tried Nando's because I'd tried their food at a catered event and I thought it was good.  Any way, we ordered a chimi and fajitas and a small pitcher of house margaritas.  Starting with the chips and salsa, I found both to be good.  The salsa that came in the miniature carafe war real good.  The one in the small bowl was meh.  The chimi was good and frankly a little more than I could eat.  Same with the fajitas.  The margaritas were meh.  There might have been liquor in there but I couldn't tell.  Also the mix was overly sweet so it continued to revisit me through most of the night.  The service while friendly was uneven at best.  We had to ask for things several times and it many cases what we asked for never came.  Overall I'd say the place was ok.",

We were seated on the patio fairly quickly. The server was nice but service was slow. There were two adults and a child who came about 20 min after us and ordered and received their food prior to us receiving ours. The food was average. I ordered a green corn tamale with cheese and I could hardly taste the corn as it was so smothered in cheese. I also had a taco but the shell fell apart from either sitting too long and getting soggy OR from not draining the meat enough before adding to the shell. The salsa was average but lacked texture. My table mates said their food was average but nothing too exceptional. I think there are other nearby mexican restaurants that I will be visiting instead.",

It's like people don't even know how to communicate these days , we have never even been here you would think guy at least would try go over drink specials or favorite / specialty menu items. Food took forever , we think he forgot to put our order in , it was over an our for fajita and burrito , people who got sat after us already were finishing their plates. We had good portion of food to take home so we asked for boxes , he literally handed me a box straight to my hands bcs there was no space on the table , excuse me , but if you can't find an empty spot on the table how do you expect me to box my own food ? How rude ! And he left without even trying to make some space by taking empty dishes away. Frankly , my bf only tipped him bcs he is nice and this guy didn't even deserve 5% of that bill, just terrible. Next time we ll sit at the bar or hopefully we get someone better, if service will be at the same level we won't be back. You guys are getting 5 stars for food and 1 for service.",

What I will say is that the atmosphere and service are very good and it's a great place to meet friends for  happy hour from 3 to 6pm. You can get pretty happy in 3 hours. The dinner fare is good but not memorable. Still, we keep coming back. I must try breakfast here soon.",

The beans are good, meat is simmered and tasty, beer's cold, not many complaints to have.  I have only one gripe...the tables in the dining room are TINY! If there are more than two people sitting down, it is tight...just saying, it gets tight and you can hardly fit your dishes on top.  Everything else is fine, the bartender is a nice guy, servers are nice, it's not a bad place at all to come hang out. I like how it's a neighborhood spot, it's not pretentious or obnoxious, you just walk in, eat, and leave. Easy!",

It's ok in my opinion, but there aren't any better choices in the area so I guess you work with what you have.  If you are craving Mexican food, while there are better places further away you could do a lot worse.  For me nothing stands out as far as flavor. Everything taste just like 100s of other ordinary Mexican restaurants so it's hard to pin point one flaw other than just say everything is average.    The service is decent so no complaints there. Nice bar and happy hours. Decor is very nice as well.  So in short: overall experience will be enjoyable , food is ok.",

As we were finally wrapping up our meal, the lunch shift staff was coming on, and they all seemed much more willing to actually do their job. I have frequented the Nando's locations, and could not believe the lack of service here. I probably won't be going to this location ever again, and being that it is the one closest to my home, probably none of them.",

I loved their decor with the Mexican ceramic tiles! So colorful. Even the ladies room was done up with the tiles! Yes, it was very clean too :)  Their chips and salsa were fabulous!!! I has to ask them to take the chips away from me!  The entrees were huge! Seriously big platters! I had gotten the 2 enchilada platter - and I had rice and veggies with it. Those grilled veggies were seriously delish! The enchiladas were good too - but nothing to super rave about. Maybe next time I should try a speciality rather than a standard menu item. I don't drink so can't tell you about their alcoholic beverages but people were at the bar - at 3pm on a weekday if that gives you any indication ;)  My son and I both enjoyed the food and our afternoon at Nando's!",

Having said all that, what I have noticed during my last two visits is the Happy Hour Margarita's almost seem to be alcohol free - no \"buzz\" or anything - even drinking one quickly on an empty stomach.  Compare Nando's Margarita's to Los Dos in Mesa, or Juan Jaime's in Chandler, and Nando's is not even in the competition.  The other thing I have noticed is the \"hot\" salsa is now very, very tame.  I love their salsa's and their mild is hard to beat.  But hot should be hot.  I will be back, and I hope the drinks will be stronger, and the salsa hotter, next time!",

We had to nuke to hear it up, the food is very tasty but the left hand didn't know what the right hand was going, total confusion, I'll try them again but the food better be hot the next time or I'm done.",

The guacamole tasted like apple cider vinegar...so not sure what happened there. I had the chimichanga it was very mediocre. The chips and salsa are not good. The salsa has a weird taste, not like a normal salsa. I have 0 desire to ever return. Worst $40 meal ever. 2 entrees. The hostesses were very unprofessional in their behavior, and they told us it would be 5 minute wait and it was closer to 20.",

Some of my favorite lunch specials are the chicken fajitas, chorizo con huevos, and their tacos are really good as well. Overall great lunch spot.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Nandos in a few months and upon returning I was surprised at the service and food. We were sat at a table that was in need of being replaced. The top of the table was cracked in multiple places and had sharp edging from where parts of the table top was missing. I asked to be moved to another table. I had two small children and they could have easily cut themselves on it. The waitress acted surprised and said she let the manager know but they continued to seat people there without a care and yet there was plenty of booths open. My husband ordered a tequila sunrise that was basically all grenadine. Chips were stale and overly salted. My father in laws chicken enchiladas had more cheese in it and on top then the actual enchilada itself. My husbands carne asada tacos were either over cooked or had been sitting out for a while. Beans on each plate looked like they had been sitting for awhile as well, they were dry. Service was ok, though the waitress was nice she took to long to come back to the table. My husband took my kids out to the lobby area and I sat at the table for more then 5 minutes just watching the waitress go back and forth. As I tried to get her attention she would race off to the bar or kitchen. It would have been recognizable to see a table with 5 of 6 people gone and that they probably want there check. For 3pm Service every aspect of our visit was subpar.",

    "text": "Sadly, our experience with Nando's has been nothing but disappointing. I say sadly because it's located to our old home and we would frequently order-in food from he neighborhood restaurants. I adore Tex-Mex/Mexican food and was hoping for a reliable spot to grab a simple meal of flautas or enchiladas every now. This ended up not happening and I'm sad about this because who wants not-so-great food within a stone's throw from one's house?  We first ordered from the restaurant when it first opened years ago. My husband went to go pick up our order and not only had they forgotten a dish and our appetizer of guacamole and chips.   The food was lackluster and strangely bland. I didn't understand how a restaurant could serve tortilla chips that resembled the consistency and taste of cardboard (yes, I had a regrettable bite of cardboard as a toddler) and cheese that was bland. Seriously, how can you mess this up and on a grand scale? How did this restaurant ever franchise?   We pointed out the missed dish and guacamole to the hostess and they generously gifted us a $15 gift card for our trouble. It was a gracious offer and one we appreciated.   The second experience we had was only a month ago when we took friends out for dinner. Their choice was Nando's and I truly wish we hadn't gone. We ordered guacamole to share with the whole table and I was highly disappointed. It almost tasted as if there was soggy and shredded lettuce in the guacamole. It was flavorless and served with yet again the blandest tortilla chips I have had in my mouth.   Then came our main dishes - I chose the chicken tacos with rice and beans on the side. It was horrifically, comically bad. The chicken was cold and the tortilla was rubbery. The rice and beans also lacked salt and overall flavor.   It also took us ten minutes to get our server's attention to pay. Even after we stood up and walked toward the front door, we didn't catch our server's attention. We asked the hostess if we could get out bill and it took yet another five minutes to get our bill. My husband, our of frustration, just handed the server his card because we were so tired of waiting to pay.   Overall, this place is in a great location and the shopping center is nice and full of delicious other spots. But, Nando's is not worth your time or money or energy. Save your calories for something else delicious.",

The chips are tasty, the salsa and \"hot\" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =(",

The restaurant itself is nice however Nando's needs to raise the bar on their food; quite bland, full of cheese and lacked dimension. I ordered the spinach enchiladas and added shrimp (up charge). I found two bites of spinach in the beginning and the portion size (small) was a surprise. I had added a mango margarita and was so-so. Guess I've been spoiled by La Casa Blanca (Chandler).  I visited Nando's in hopes to bring a work group activity here.",

The basic chips and salsa they serve at the table were fine, and the drinks were actually really good. I would definitely try some of their frozen margaritas if you do decide to go here. I ordered a chimichanga and was really disappointed...I think the only ingredients in it were steak, onions, and peppers...which actually sounds more like a cheesesteak than a chimichanga. It was also very salty, and I did not enjoy it too much.  In fact, it was one of the worst chimichangas I have ever tasted and usually I am excited when going to a mexican restaurant because I love mexican food.

I thought it was good the first time but I also thought the beer was good too so I wanted to wait to go again to write a review in case the beer was talking the first time. But no it is confirmed this place is really good. Now I won't say wow this is the best Mexican food I have ever had ever and I will never go anywhere else but it's at the top of the list. The restaurant itself is very nice. The aesthetic inside and out is great. I really like the big iron tree that is covered in lights that divides the restaurant from the bar area. It's a small place but there is plenty of room and no wait to be seated. The staff is very friendly but I have to say our waitress the first time was a little bit better than our waiter the second. They both did a great job but the waitress the first time was just a little more personable. Now the company I was with might have effected my experience too. With friends the first time and parent the second. So I might of had a little more fun and therefore a better experience the first time. Great food. I had the Sonoran Enchiladas this time. Very good. Filling too. Awesome chips and salsa too. They may have contributed to the fullness. I also like the fact that they have real Mexican beer on tap and you can order pitchers if you want. They give you a pitcher of water when you sit down as well so you are never short on water. Always a good thing. Overall I think this is a great place and I will be back. In fact I will be there again in a few weeks with friends.",

Beautiful restaurant interior and atmosphere. Big and you don't feel crowded or that people are eavesdropping into your conversation. I had a WONDERFUL server that far exceeded our expectations. Chips and salsa, plain amazing! The food portions were HUGE, and for a great price in my opinion. I got a combo and I had so much, I had lunch for the next day at work. I got to try my friends dishes and they were nothing short of delicious. That is passionate food right there. I cannot wait to go back. In these times, I don't usually do 5 stars, but we just had such a blast and was so surpised at the quality of the food and presentation, they deserve it.",

Very nice.We sat at the bar, shared an appetizer, service from the 2 young ones behind the bar was excellent and the food portions were massive.  Parking could get a bit tough during Happy Hour and evening given the number of other restaurants and businesses there but that wouldn't stop us from going again.

    "text": "We have dined here twice and dinner couldn't have been more inconsistent.  It was almost as if it was two different restaurants.  The first time, dinner was delicious, came out promptly, and I couldn't wait to go back.  Unfortunately, our second visit was much, much different from our first.  My husband and I ordered the exact same item both times.  We split the chicken El Jefe (Chimichanga).  Rarely do we eat Mexican food, but we have found that the portions are always enough for two people, and this entree is just right for two.  The first time the El Jefe had wonderful flavor and was full of chicken.  My son ordered the chicken fingers (although he loves tacos) because he didn't realize he could substitute the rice and beans for french fries.  He cannot stand rice and beans. The chicken fingers were fine; it's really difficult to ruin chicken fingers. However, on the second visit, the El Jefe was full of onions.  I am not over exaggerating when I tell you I had 4 pieces of bite-sized chicken in my  1/2 of the chimichanga and the rest onions.  I kept asking my husband, do you have all the chicken?  He finally realized his  1/2 was nothing but onions too.  Who wants to sit and eat an onion chimichanga?  My son ordered a taco this time around.  It was a huge taco, but when he finally got to the meat in the taco, it was ice cold.  Not that it sat there at room temperature and got cold, I actually stuck my finger in the meat after he complained that it was cold, and it was refrigerator cold, as if it just came out of the icebox.  I didn't want to complain to the waitress about both dinner items, so I only complained about my son's cold taco.  She apologized and asked to get him something else.  By this time, he didn't want anything else.  She was nice enough to remove his food from the bill.   So, to top everything off.  We were waiting for the waitress to bring back our credit card, and my son wanted an ice cube.  There wasn't any in my glass, so I poured some ice from our table pitcher into my glass.  I look in the pitcher, and there is a tiny, dead fruit fly stuck on one of the pieces of ice....YUM!  What a way to end our dinner out! I know we won't be running back here anytime soon.  I don't know if I will even give them a third try.  It's just odd to visit the same place, have almost the exact same food, and the experience be so drastically different.",

Second time we ordered a bunch of appetizers including guacamole cheese crisp, green Chile cheese crisp, chicken nachos, beef nachos, and the taco platter (it was a big party.)

    "text": "I have to update my review after my experience today. I came in to enjoy a nice lunch with my husband only to be frustrated and disrespected! Let's start off with the dirty plates and cups which I quickly set aside and we should have left then. The waitress came over and wanted to get our drink order and I let her know that we needed a minute. After about 10 minutes I went up to the bar and let her know we are ready to order. She seemed to have an attitude and said with a tone \"oh, well I was just taking care of other things\" She came over finally and then we ordered 2 appetisers a lunch plate and a to go plate. She brought us the cheese crisp tray and we let her know that we didn't need it. We had to tell her 3 times and she rudely took it away and then she proceeded to talk about us laughing and twirling the tray to other employees and the manager. I felt so disrespected at that point and again we should have left but didn't. At this point we did get our appetisers and watched multiple tables get their food way before us when they had come in way after us. I thought they had just forgotten about us. Finally the food came out and the manager took it to the wrong table. Ok...it happens.  So we ate kinda, as some items were cold and stale and others were extremely hot! Then I asked the waitress for a to-go box and some extra salsa to take with the leftover chips and she just brought me the box. I asked again for the salsa and she rudely said \"I can't give you any to go, that's the policy.\" I said since when? We have been coming here for years?? She rudely said it's always been the policy and that everyone else wasn't doing their jobs right so she can not let me have any salsa.  My husband was pretty upset at this point with the entire ordeal so he looked at the manager and she quickly started telling him about the salsa issue. He then took off to the back and wouldn't come back out so we could inform him of all the issues. (which I'm sure he knew since he was part of the issue)! This is entirely unprofessional and disrespectful on so many levels. You don't treat a paying customer like this. It seems that there are different employees and manager in today. Service has gone downhill and everyone seems put out, rude and lazy!",

I called to let the manager know how bad the food was and she didn't seem the least bit concerned in what I was saying. She even questioned what time I came to pick up the food implying it may have been cold because it was sitting a long time. Left hungry and out $16.00 for 3 crappy bean & cheese burritos.

Portions are big, I usually get a to go box for part of my combo.  The fajita pasta and pollo rico are delicious!  I can't ever remember waiting to be seated though they are usually busy.  Service is hit and miss, never poor but occasionally lacking energy.  For most of my life I lived in CA, NM and AZ, the flavors lean towards the NM  style.  The green chile pork is done very well.  Chicken for the tacos/enchiladas seems to be stewed and is bland but that's why they give you salsa so that you can spice it to your taste.  I will continue to go and have no issues introducing it to friends.",

I would rather be gutted in a medieval torture room, have my heartbroken 3 times by the same person, live on the street for the rest of my life than eat at this shithole again. From the very onset of our visit when the waitress who poured our water didnt even understand simple english (meaning our questions fell on deaf ears), I knew this would be a disaster. After ordering from an unappealing menu, we waited for a bit until I started to feel itchy. Looking around, there were mosquitoes everywhere. Confused, I turned around only to find we were seated right next to a trashbag. When I asked the waitress (a different girl) about it, all she had to say was \"yeah they come around a lot at this time it sucks haha.\" Wow, thanks for pointing out the obvious! Im no idiot, I've lived in AZ, and most indoor places do not have mosquitoes socializing around every table like some sort of insect rave. Instead of doing anything about it, my complaint fell on dead ears while I tried to enjoy my food despite having to scratch my arm like some sort of flea infested cat. Unfortunately, the food itself was awful. I had the \"Pollo Rico\" and although I am not proficient at spanish, I now realize that \"rico\" probably means \"bullshit.\" Bland, uninspired dishes with nothing that stood out made the already awful experience shittier. Do not go to this hellhole. Do it for me if not yourself.",

But, we didn't have to wait to be seated, which was nice, being on a time crunch. The interior is nicely decorated with a welcoming atmosphere. The noise level was a bit on the \"loud\" side due to the larger lunch parties, but not too bad. I will just say that the booth seating was rather crowded. I felt bad for a couple of the bulkier guys in our party, if I was already scrunched in there uncomfortable! Definitely opt for table & chair seating over the booths!!   The service is great! Promptly greeted & seated. Our server was with us less than a minute of being seated & drinks came out almost immediately after ordering. Same with the cheese crisp appetizer we ordered. It was a bit greasy- but you come to expect that with a generous topping of cheese! And of course, the complimentary chips & salsa is always a plus while waiting for the main dish.   The food is decent. Nothing that certainly stands out in comparison to other Mexican restaurants, in my opinion. You'll find the usual fare accompanied with bland rice & beans. But the portions are plentiful & the prices are decent. I had the chili rilleno lunch special & it was more than enough, being served w/ the rice, beans & a few warmed flour tortillas. I initially wanted just the appetizer of nachos- but was informed it is enough to feed 4! Not bad for less than $10!! We would have split that, had we known. But even with the plentiful lunch special & a drink, the bill was less than $13, and I feel like it was worth it.   I can see us coming back in the future for lunch or even happy hour! They have a decent bar selection, tv's & a nice environment for group gatherings of various parties. Overall we really enjoyed our lunch & had a great experience! Our server was friendly, knowledgeable & attentive, as well as all of the personnel we encountered. Not a bad place to stop in for a decent & affordable meal whether it be lunch, dinner or just happy hour.",

This is where the bartender and server are dating, show off their relationship in front you, and what matters most, which customer service, takes a backseat in this restaurant.    By the way, I am not kidding.  The food is bland, the bartender is the worst, and the general manager never called back to hear my complaint even though I was refunded my bill.  There are other places and so don't waste your time here unless you like plates, utensils, and lime wedges tossed in your direction.  If you do, then once again this place is for you.",

The hot salsa could be hotter - but I appreciated that it wasn't chunky. I ordered a frozen mango margarita. It was hard to drink because the ice was still chunky and clogged the straw - but the flavor was good. Our food was bland - the sauce was excessive - but the portions were huge and a good value for the money.   Unfortunately, the service was really bad. Our server didn't check back with us, no drink refills, no salsa refills, and no manners (thanks, etc.). She either had too many tables or doesn't have the skill-set for service.   Overall, it was a so-so experience - doubt that we will return.",

The environment is casual and decor not too exciting but you don't eat the walls. The waitstaff is pleasant and efficient.   The signature drinks are just normal drinks with different names, but are surprisingly strong. I had the Perfect Storm Margarita, which is a Cadillac margarita.    I had the Barrio Tacos with beans and rice. The Carne Asada was a bit dry and there was a green sauce that I couldn't tell what it was. It wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable.   For desert we shared the ice cream sandwich. They forgot the chocolate sauce but it was pretty amazing anyway.   If you are old and have no tastebuds left then this is a good place to eat. If you just want desert and some stiff drinks then this is a great place.",

Make it a killer happy hour and promote it.   This happy hour food menu is off the chart creative. The dishes are shareable and tasty.   I love a happy hour that appeals to those who like a cocktail to unwind and to those who prefer a tasty treat.   Nando's entrees are big and have flavor.  A restaurant has to cater to many taste buds. So if the flavor is not spicy enough. They have a hot sauce and a mild sauce.   Our favorite is the pizzas (happy hour and non happy hour), machaca and eggs and the nachos (happy hour nachos rock but we obviously don't say no to the main menu nachos either)   Nando's started out rocky with its service. I think they've done a great job ironing out what brings customers back.   I hope they keep heading up in the reviews and get some credit they deserve for being good competitors in a hard market.",

Okay truth is we moved like 8-9 miles  but hey we are creatures of habit and well change even this simple involves finding new places close to home. Which brings me to the discovery of Nando's. See we have been here 20yrs and never heard of this place, I posted this on my FB and everyone I know was like \"Yeah good food\" or \"Yeah its alright\"!!   So for us a True test of a Mexican restaurant is the house margarita (rocks and salt). See if you are won over by the simple things then won't you be wowed by the rest ? well it is our theory and it has held up for us.    Now lets talk margaritas !! Okay so if you ever had a Coronarita then you will enjoy the Nando's margarita. Now for me I like my drinks friendly, I want to be able to taste the \"to-kill-ya\" aka the Tequila. on the first sip we didn't taste any, not even on the second.  I'm happy to report that after the second round ( obviously for taste testing purposes) we discovered that our drinks fall in the category of \"dangerous\" because it will hit you later.   After all that I'm sure you want to know about the food. We had the lunch specials, mine was tacos, and his a chile relleno. The portions are huge! We took home the leftover rice and beans for dinner the next night. if your curious about dessert, we ordered the banana flan. I think it was okay, the peanuts kill the flavor a bit for me. I think a drizzle of caramel instead would have been best, but my husband ate it up like it was going out of style, so there you go. Will we go back ? obviously for more accurate taste testing purposes.",

I hate being sat in the bar and served by the bartender because I get the worst service.  This night was no exception. She was training which was fine, but the service was horrible all around. I ordered  the Enchiladas  del Mar. Upon arrival there was no silverware, I waited several minutes as she went to retrieve them from wherever. The dish, they should be embarrassed  to serve this dish. After I picked through it and told the server/bartender there is no crab and minimal shrimp, I was over it. She did offer me if I wanted to order another meal which I declined, I was then given the bill. The item was still on the bill. I was not offered desert or another drink. Overall it was a crap experience and unfortunately  there are way too many other places to enjoy where I can have a decent enchilada and better service.",

My waiter kept refilling my water and made sure I liked the food, and checked on me whether I wanted another drink.  Food:  *Chips and Salsa* They bring out two different types of salsa. One is spicy, the other not so much. Both are delicious. The chips are housemade and weren't stale. Delicious.   *Chicken Fajitas* the chicken was perfectly cooked, came sizzling hot, just as I would have expected from a chicken fajita platter, but the seasoning was beyond my expectations. Not too salty, not too spicy, not too much of anything, but just perfect. The onions and peppers were in perfect proportion to the chicken as well. The chicken fajitas came with sides of guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. It also came with two flour tortillas. You can choose between flour or corn, and I chose flour. The Mexican rice it came with was amazing as well. I can go on and on about how perfectly seasoned all the food was, but the rice was pretty much the epitome of perfection. Beans on the side had cheese on top. So much yum in one dish!!  I had a good amount of leftovers to eat for lunch the next day. Superb.  Drinks:  *House Margarita* I came during happy hour, so my margarita was only $4! and not too sweet or salty. Tasted delicious.  I want to come back here and try some more dishes. I highly recommend this place to those of you that are like me and prefer more Tex-Mex style dishes!",

Nothing not to love about this place.   The salsa is great and the carne al carbon is pretty tasteful. I might reduce the size of the servings, though.   Great addition to the area!",

As we were ushered to our table, a cute girl came and introduced herself as the waitress. As she was taking our orders, a plate of chips and salsa came. Wow! It seemed so choreographed. Our orders came in about the right time. Not too soon, not too long. And they were huge portions! They tasted good too. We are light eaters, so we had to bag the rest. While waiting for our check, the owner/manager came over and briefly chatted with us - asking about the food and service. He was glad we liked it and had some left to bring home.   I would definitely come back for the food (need to try the other entrees), service and the convenience (close to home).",

Took 20mins to bring us drinks, 1hr to take our order, almost 40mins to get our food and took us 30mins to flag our server down to pay the check. To pay it!!! We could have easily walked out without paying and our server would have still been ignoring us/ not noticing we were gone. Besides that our server did not write down our orders and brought the pickiest member of our party a messed up order. On top of that tried to charge us for add ons that were clearly stated not wanted. We will go back but make sure its when the good servers are working and in the bar where you aren't forgotten.",

    "text": "I went to Nando's hoping to find a really good Mexican food joint that reminds me of the Mexican food in Texas; not Sonoran style.  The location is pretty good, plenty of parking in and about the shopping center.  The ambiance of the restaurant is family friendly; maybe a bit too much as this place was really LOUD including crying babies.  That was almost enough to make me turn and RUN.  I for one do not like to pay for a meal and cannot converse in a normal tone...who wants to YELL at their dinner companion and pay for the privilege of YELLING.  However really wanting to find that good Mexican food joint, I stayed put.     First let me tell you they provide really tasty chips and salsa, as well as a pitcher of ice water. I ordered their Chicken Chimichanga which was a HUGE portion.  The overall flavor was OK, refried beans had a bit too much melted cheese on top, the chicken was grilled and tasty, however way to many white onions throughout...some bites were onions only!  So, did I find my really good Mexican food joint?  I'm not sure as of this posting so I will give it another try or two; sure hope the LOUD atmosphere is not the norm and the food reminds me of home in Texas.  Three and Half stars for LOUD atmosphere...",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've NEVER given a terrible review.  Generally we like most places and find something to enjoy about our visit.  I have had lunch with some girls from work at Nandos and enjoyed it, so we decided to give it a try for dinner since my son was in the mood for shredded beef tacos.  We visited Nando's on a Friday evening with my husband and two kids, and came away feeling like I just threw away $75.  My daughters kids' cheeseburger was a thin, rock hard, pre-frozen patty, that looked as bad as it tasted, she barely ate three bites...and trust me, she's an eater.  My son got the shredded beef tacos and he enjoyed them!  Nothing negative to say.  I ordered a skinny margarita and being it was Friday night, I took a huge swig, and about spit it out.  It tasted like straight lime juice with a shot of tequila in it, either that or the skinny mix was rotten...it was that terrible and bitter.  I asked my husband to try it to see if I was nuts, and he reacted the same way.  I've honestly never had a \"bad\" margarita, until I had their margarita.  I ordered the street tacos and the beef looked and tasted like frozen beef strips that you'd get from Taco Bell...like the beef was pieced together and wasn't real beef.  My husband ordered a seafood enchilada that was all cream sauce and zero seafood...literally zero.  He ordered a Hornitas margarita with a floater of Chambord and got a blended margarita with raspberry sauce put in it...when he asked where his floater of Chambord was, our server told us the bar said \"they didn't have 'floaters'\".  Ummm...what?  My son was the only one who ate his meal...the rest of us ate less than 1/4 of our plates.  Oh well...lesson learned.  Never visiting there, again!",

We went there for dinner and ordered a house margarita, a cheese crisp for the little one and a mini combo platter. The margarita tasted like soap, no lie it had bubbles, the cheese crisp was good, our son ate sufficiently and the mini combo platter, yeah that sucked big time. The meat and tortillas tasted funny, it had cheese overload and the only thing good from it were the mini tacos. Their chips and salsa are good and service was pretty good. Our waitress took off the combo platter, even after we told her not to (so she deserved her tip above and beyond).",

For my entree I ordered the mexican shrimp pasta which was absolutely delicious and spicy. Washed down the food with delicious locally brewed hop knot IPA which was freshly on tap. The patio was awesome because we could have our dogs there and Brian, our server, even gave them each a bowl of water. The manager Blake personally came out to check on us and was very friendly. I will definitely come back on my next trip to AZ and recommend to all my friends.",

The portions looked huge and generous.  Upon closer inspection, it was the rice and beans that were generous.  The tacos themselves were pretty small and tasted like tacos you'd normally get at a decent taco stand for half the price.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  It tasted fresh.  I'm from Houston, Texas, and used to the excellent Mexican food there.  This place misses the mark in comparison.  Shortly after eating here, I did not feel very good.  After 4 hours I felt pretty bad and had to go to bed early.  I tossed and turned a lot.  The next morning went to the bathroom and had diarrhea.  Okay, so I am not coming back.  A little bit overpriced and food poisoning is not healthy.",

    "text": "We frequent the restaurant next door to Nando's, saw this restaurant and thought to give it a try for lunch, especially after seeing reviews. We were greeting with a very friendly staff, but our actual waitress not so friendly, felt a bit of an attitude. Chips, Salsa, and drinks came right away. Atmosphere was nice. We ordered a lunch special: Chile Relleno, Rice and Beans. I thought it was very bland and CHEESE on EVERYTHING, the portions of rice and beans and cheese were huge and the chili Rellenos absolutely no taste. We also ordered the beef Burrito, which was OK tasting, the disappointment was for all the nickle and dimming for the extra charges for sour cream, jalapenos and cheese etc...  OK maybe it was just the Chandler location, but we were not impressed at all, considering there are so many other Mexican restaurants to choose from. If all you care about is portion size (which is huge) and cheese and don't care much about taste then this is the place for you.",

Perhaps our server was new and inexperienced, but he started taking our order, then abruptly left our table to go to another table across the room to answer their question.  Right in the middle of taking our order!  Once our order was in, he was okay.  But, we had to wait several minutes after we were finished eating before he brought the check.  Then, after leaving the credit card, he disappeared.  After 25 minutes, we got up to leave and had to find the hostess to let her know we were still waiting for our bill to come back.  As we were talking, our server came with our check.  (Apparently, they had accidentally thrown away our gift card and had to fish it out of the trash...)  We will probably go again because of the food, but hope they step their training of servers...",

They told us, however, that they would honor the Happy Hour prices until 6 pm which they did.  Those that ordered from the HH menu got huge meals at very reasonable prices.  I saw street tacos (3 tacos per plate) with rice and refried beans and another order of a HUGE nacho platter.  Margaritas and sangria were ordered by several ladies--again at the HH price.  I ordered off of the menu and got a Machaca Tostada with pinto beans and guacamole.  I took half of it home because it was so big.  It was also delicious.  The service was great--we had one waitress for 20 of us.  She was patient and handled us with efficiency.  I was impressed!  Will definitely go back.",

The manager, hostess and our server all decided to let us use the empty room that was closed for the night so that it would be a little quieter and that we could enjoy our meal. The little one called down with the lower lights and quieter atmosphere. The food was amazing as well. We have never been treated like that with our kids at a restaurant, it was hands down the best service that either me or my girlfriend have ever received! To top it off at the end of our meal the waitress brought us a free fried ice cream because she could tell that we were a little stressed out. Thank you Nando's you have earned customers for life!",

I was planning my father's 80th birthday party and since I live out of town and we were expecting 30 guests, we decided to have it delivered and set up with burners.  They also offer the serving service but I declined that.  Nando's is my father's favorite restaurant. (His favorite item is their beef burrito.)   He's 100% Mexican and knows good Mexican food.   I worked with Louis, the manager.  I appreciated that he didn't try to oversell the amount of food and respected my pocket book.  We went with a few of their party platters,  several types of enchiladas,  tamales, beans/rice, chips, salsa and taquitos.   The lady who delivered the food was on time,  explained useful tips to keep the food warm and not soggy, and was expeditious with the set up.  All the food was very good!  I recieved so many complements on the food from the guests,  who also happen to be  Mexican.  The food was very reasonably priced, high quality  and Louis was extremely professional and made it easy for me.   If I ever need catering in the future, Nando's will be place I use.  Thank you for making my dad's 80th memorable!",

Diving in the food was slightly crusted over, plates were scorching hot leading me to believe these were thrown in an oven to reheat prior to bringing out. We had three different ppl tend to us all of whom saw us about twice each and then bailed. Terrible experience, and we won't be returning to this location.",
