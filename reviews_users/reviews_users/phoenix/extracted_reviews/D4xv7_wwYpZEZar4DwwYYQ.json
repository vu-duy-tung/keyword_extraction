    "text": "So I've been here a few times and have felt their Burger/Fries deal was good. Nothing special - most other locations have a burgers and fries deal that are ok - LB is about the same.  One thing I go for is the Shakes - THEY ARE AWESOME.   This time I decided to splurge on the onion rings with tax they are almost $4 - I was advised there is only one size.  I also got a BLT and a regular Shake - all for $10.06 - yeah I know, not so cheap but all a la carte.   The onion rings were not so great - BAD.  I was given 7 rings..for almost $4 i thought that was CRAZY!! so I called to voice my concern.  I mentioned this and the guy who answered replied:   \"You were given 7 (rings)? you should have been given 8 (rings)!\"   what? that's crazy, I thought he was pulling my leg.  Then he mentioned he only works there and the owners make the pricing and he \"Can't do anything about it\"    Nothing worse then employee who does not give a rats $#^&  - i didn't expect anything for free and mentioned that I just wanted to let them know that in today's economy consumers would expect MUCH more for the prices we pay.  If it had been a good onion ring I might have not called but alas it was bland and reminded me of Burgers Kings O.R.s - pretty bad but at least BK gives your more rings...  Very very bad Lucky Boy. I will only go back for your shakes and only shakes...",

    "text": "Umm delicious!! New Category: Best Drive Thru Burger  There will always be a throw down on who has the best burger in town. Yet, its usually the crafty artisan types that win. No complaints there because they are usually tasty and deserve a prize. But when it comes to fast food and drive thru's we are all guilty of indulging in one to many chain establishments where no credit is due.   This is where Lucky Boy saves the day. An establishment that has been around since the golden age of fast food serving up charbroiled burgers to order, ice cream shakes, and crunchy fries that won't break the bank.   I picked up the 1/4lb international, fries and a coke for just around 6 bucks. Delicious! Swing by and check this place out.",

My friends showed up and were kind of scared though they haven't been out with me for ages so it would be an adventure for them. Ill dodge bullets for a good bite to eat and they know it!   Burgers, fries shakes and a few odds and ends on the menu well, here it goes. Ordered a half pound burger with cheese and a side of fries, 4.99 as well as a strawberry milkshake.. I was making sure we all ordered what they are known for, good burgers, fries and shakes.. okay, so I'm blown away! The burger was totally juicy without being greasy.. the fries were crispy and flavorful and the shake tasted like it should have.. thick, creamy and fruity! My friends all LOVED the food here and were thanking me on the way out.. so much for it being scary.   Lucky Boy rocks! The burgers remind me of how a good burger should be, simple, tasty and cheap. Now that's American!",

Picked up the Lucky Burger with 1000 Island dressing, took a bite and literally said..  \"My God that's a good burger...\"  and had to pause to write this real quick.  I'll let you know how the rest was shortly...  **after burger**  Holy s***...  The charbroil taste of every bite along with the flavor of meat, 1000island dressing and the veggies just sent this burger to the top of my list.  Imagine going to a family BBQ and everyone's favorite grill master is behind the grill doing his work.. this is what it's like.  The fries were also fresh and crunchy, just the way I like it.  Glad this is close to work, cause I will be a regular here.    ...sucks im on a diet!",

Second, I returned with my 13 year old son to the drive thru.  Shakes were huge and pretty good.  Burgers were also large.  Maybe not the best burger, but plentiful toppings and large patties with large buns to hold a lot of those toppings in.  Fries were excellent and disappeared almost immediately.  Friendliness of staff came through even during the drive-thru experience.   My son was less inspired but he is still in the hamburger with no fixings stage.  So, he was less than thrilled but I chalk it up to his youth and immature palette.   I am a huge fan of restaurants with good food which are not chains.  This is one of those places and they deserve our support.   Will definitely return!  Long live Lucky Boy Burgers!",

The shakes are thick and fruity. I appreciate fries that are greasy but crisp, and in a brown paper bag and that's what you will get from Lucky Boy.   Lucky Boy not to be confused with the famous Big Boy burger shop (although you cannot miss the shop, there is a gigantic Big Boy-esque sign in red on top of the restaurant).

Burnt Burger I went to this place last week and I ordered a double with cheese and bacon Thousand Island Style with onion rings, both patties were burnt to a crisp black and crispy. I called I spoke to Gill and he told me he will replace my order just ask for him. So I go in there today because I live nowhere near this place and the guy at the counter was really rude and he tells me that I ordered it last week and I should have came back that day that's not what Gil told me or I would have came back the same day. So the lady that's cooking the burgers tells me she never Burns burgers while there's flames shooting up in her face... so he tells me my Burger is ready and I get it go out to my car open it up just to check it and now the buns are burnt to a crisp. I didn't want to go back in because I was pissed off and didn't want to argue with this guy or his wife. I don't know if they did this on purpose but I will never go back. I could have went up the street to In and Out Burger and got a great Burger for a lot cheaper than what I paid here. This is my first time ever posting and I eat out a lot but I have to let this be known, don't waste your time there's way better burger places all over the valley skip this place and get a better Burger elsewhere.",

I also appreciate they have fried mushrooms which is a treat for this Midwestern girl. Another perk: you can call in your order and it's hot an fresh whenever you say you can get there. I left off one star because they close earlier than a lot of restaurants. Many times, I get the crave for their food right when they close (around 8). So you got to plan ahead.",

Their menu is straightforward and nothing fancy, and that makes me happy.  I got a Bacon Cheeseburger with Ranch a side of fries and a soda.  I think all of that cost maybe 5 bucks, so it's definitely budget conscious.  The burger was good and yummy, pretty much exactly the way I expected it to be.  The fries were also pretty good.  They were crisp on the outside, but fluffy on the inside.  I should have gotten some ranch to dip them in, because that would have been amazing.

I needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat. My insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good. I had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ).  They just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone. Are there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so.  Lucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!",

    "text": "I had driven by here several times and liked the look of the little shop.  It's right next to the Circle K on the corner of 16th and Thomas.  Last Satuday my daughter and I started out to run some errands and one of them was right by Lucky Boy's.  We were greated warmly and it appeared to be a mother and son.   Mom was working the grill and son was taking the orders.  My daughter had her standard hot dog and I ordered a 1/4 burger with bacon and swiss.  We got fries and I got an order of fried zuchinni sticks.  My daughter had a butterscotch milkshake.  That was one of the best shakes I have tasted in a while.  It was not overly sweet and it was thick and creamy.  Our food came out hot and fresh, so hot we had to wait a few minutes for it to cool off.  My burger was done to perfection.  It was delish!!  I am somewhat of a purist so I did not have all the standard condiments on my burger, just the burger, cheese and bacon and I added some ketchup.  Excellent!  My daughter's hot dog did not last long.  She said it was awesome....and gave it a thumbs up.  High praise from her.  The fries......oh the fries.  Crispy on the outside and potatoy fulffiness on the inside.  They were sheer perfection!!  I'm getting hungry for them again just writing this.  The zuchinni sticks were excellent too.  They had a really nice, crunchy batter on the outside but it did not overwhelm the zuchinni inside.  All in all the food was excellent.  It's a little more than standard fast food but honestly, you get what you pay for and this was worth every penny.    The inside is not very big but there are several tables to sit and a little bar over looking the drive thru.  The drive thu is old school.  A little bell goes off when I car pulls in and your order is taken.  It seemed the cars had to wait a bit but I think the wait is well worth it.  The inside is also clean.  Not spotless but clean and the service is friendly.  They have all the standard fare a burger joint should have and it's all freshly made.  This is a great find.  I will be back for sure!!  A little gem just near my house.....I'm lucky!",

The second to the last visit, I took my out of town relatives to Lucky Burger because they wanted a \"good burger.\"  Between the three of us, we ordered quite a bit of food.  My cousin wanted to bring in a diet (?) Dr. Pepper can that she had in a cooler to enjoy it with her burger and proceeded to ask for a cup of ice.  The owner denied us a cup of ice and said we were not allowed to bring in outside drinks.  I found it to be a bit unreasonable since we ordered lots of food AND drink.  How was one can of soda going to hurt the man, financially?  I was embarrassed as I had recommended Lucky Burger to my out of town guests.  A few months later, I returned and ate a burger, fries and soda.  I think the prior experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I was no longer able to enjoy the meal (followed by a stomach ache).  I will no longer eat at Lucky Burger nor will I recommend the location to my house guests.",

    "text": "Ignored this dive for 20 years, til the Yelp raves....and they're right. It's really good.    Burgers are grilled and custom dressed with Ranch, Thousand Island, BBQ, etc. Even the tomato slice tastes better than the machine lathed sliver served at McDonalds. Shakes are unusually thick, without the chain's aerated aftertaste; plus there's a neat flavor selection ( butterscotch, cinnamon, Oreo, Butterfinger, et al).  Trust me and opt for the smaller size (20 oz for $2.50) - it'll satisfy you. My teen was laughing how he felt like he drank a full shake and was only a third of the way done. I had to finish mine at home.   Appears owner operated by a middle aged couple, who take quality and service seriously. You're greeted when you place your order, a friendly thank you on the way out - drive thru customers are addressed as sir and maam. Not much seating - three tables and some stools along the windows -  I'm guessing this is a 90% drive thru operation , but it's kinda fun to sit in such a tiny retro place, with it's odd shape, interior block columns and 1950's era, residential exterior door. Lucky Boy's beat up,  but authentic in a way retro palaces like 5 & Diner arent, and the kind of rare post war jewelbox more often espied in central LA - maybe in a Tupac video or bad Steve Martin movie.    The neighborhhod's iffy at night and a rather nefarious Circle K looms nearby,  but I wouldnt let the surroundings deprive you of an unusual throwback experience at this earnest little eatery - at least not in daylight.",

Atmosphere could use some work. Small dining area. Location is difficult to get in and out of.   But who cares about atmosphere when you can dig into a 1/2 pound with fries for under $5. Get your food to go if you are scared.   Reminded me of what Lenny's used to be like.",

I got the standard cheeseburger with everything on it, a side of fries and a fountain drink. The menu is actually pretty vast, and you can order a burger, etc, no matter what your tastes are on a given day. I really liked the burger; all the ingredients were fresh and in the right proportions. I would come back if I was in the area and had a hankering for a burger, but would not travel much... Top 10 burger spot in the valley, but behind places like Lenny's and Chuckbox, and even Fudruckers.",

Noticing this, I was all smiles as I drove home. When I got home, I discovered two charbroiled (not fried) beef patties with shredded (not leafed) lettuce and crinkle-cut pickle slices as well as tomato, chopped onion, and ranch dressing served up on a sesame-seed bun and wrapped tightly in white food paper. The burger patties were the exact size of the bun and the burger does not fall apart when you eat it. The lettuce doesn't even fall all over you when you unwrap it - this is the most perfectly positioned stack of ingredients I have ever encountered! French fries come with your burger and they were of very good quality, a nice solid thickness (not dick-limp like McDonald's but not too thick like steak fries, either) and not greasy at all.",

The signs and menus were original, kept up, though showing wear over the 64 years it has been open. There is a drive-thru and seating inside.   The prices are extremely cheap. Going in we thought perhaps it would reflect the quality of the food. But we were pleasantly surprised. The man who took our order was so pleasant and sweet. And the food was actually pretty good. For $4.39, I ordered a burger and fries. They were made-to-order and piping hot when I got it. The burger was cooked well, and the fries were tasty.  If I lived here, I would probably go every now and then.",

We used the drive thru and I ordered the  1/2 lb Lucky Burger with a side of green chilies and Swiss cheese.    It was well cooked, juicy and hot, but I didn't realize it would be served with so much mustard. Next time I'll just ask for no mustard as I think the mustard kinda overpowered the over flavors.  The green chilies and the Swiss cheese were wonderful options though.  (I have a soft spot for any burger place that offers either of those two as toppings.)     I also ordered some French fries with my burger and they were the perfectly cut, thick type of French fry that you think of when you get fries at a smaller burger establishment, not the skinny, homogenous looking creations you'll find at the large chain places.    Overall this was a good visit and I'll definitely be returning.",

Burgers were as good as everyone else wrote about. Good flavor and very filling. Will be the place to go in the future.   French fries were not as crispy as either of us had hoped but it was the end of the night so we are guessing they threw a bunch in for the last few cars that pulled in at the same time. Onion rings were hot and crunchy. Want to try the zucchini next time. Plan to order extra sauce on the side for the international burger 'cause it was good and wanted more! Can see why this place has bee around so long!",

The staff was very friendly and spoke to owner while I was waiting and he said they had been open 66 years and I always appreciate places that stay open that long and become part of the town history. I like that the place is like 10 minutes from my house so def will be going back.. Now for the food.. I was recommended by my friend to get the one pound burger. I don't think I have ever ate a burger that big.. it came with 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese and fries, I also ordered the two patty with cheese and bacon for my wife.. sadly when we got home and sat down to eat realized they forgot the bacon but either way a huge burger, wish a drink would of been included as the tab for both burgers and fries came to almost $23 which I think might be a little pricey but you forget all about that when you are eating it. Lol. Be sure to be hungry if you go there.. till next time thank you",

My order came to around $9. The burger was just regular , nothing special. In fact the burger was fairly slim although it did cover the whole bun. I like my burgers a little thicker. The fries were thick but tasted just plain. Not as good as McDonalds fries, but they were edible. The milkshake however was outstanding. It was thick and creamy and had real strawberry bits in it. Oh my gawd, it was delicious, I was slurping on it till the end and still tried to get every last drop when it was over. This place was A-OK",

Downside like everyone says is the pay for refills but it isn't that much and no restrooms, also no outside drinks which is understandable.  The lemonade is worth it for sure as is everything, the grilled cheese, chili cheese fries, fresh chicken nuggets, etc. Beats any other burger in town though. Worth the drive or if you are in the area definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed at all. Came across this place on unfortunate circumstances but thankfully I was shown it, made me feel a lot better. Again, BEST BURGERS EVER!",

    "text": "At the end of a long drive to Phoenix for a tour and football camp at Arizona State University in Tempe, my lil big man and I checked into our hotel and it hit - we were starving.  So me having a technology love fest that includes an assortment of functional gadgets (i.e. my iPhone, iPad), I whipped out my iphone, hit the Yelp app and typed in \"burgers.\"  Of course, Phoenix isn't on Mars, so naturally in n out showed, as well as several more burger joints in the area.  I wasn't necessarily interested in driving too far for a meal.  However, I saw one place that was less than 1/4 of a mile from my hotel, Lucky Boy Burgers.  The ratings were high so I guessed not everyone could be wrong about this place and decided to go.  I'm glad I did.  Most of the best burgers come from \"hole in the wall\" places. Unencumbered by corporate diluted meat and operational handbook limited portions, I've found these are the best places for a non-corporate burger.  When I saw the building, it was a stand alone building on a pretty empty street (it was 108 degrees at 5pm).  We parked and walked inside.  I have to say I love a place that recognizes what they do and do it well. The last thing I hate is to walk in a burger joint and see they make everything from burgers to shrimp fried noodles.  Something about that wide variety of edible harmony just doesn't sound like it makes good music.  Bad example, but I think you get the point.  I checked the menu and they had like 4-5 different types of their primary burger. They had baby sizes too, but I'm a grown man and not about to get a baby sized anything.   I settled on the International, with the recommendation of the guy taking the orders.  I don't do ground beef and they didn't have any turkey, but I was soooo  hungry I didn't care.  1. They were fast.  It didn't take long to get our order. That's always a plus. 2. When he handed me the bag, if felt like 30 pounds of burger in the bag.  Now that might be a turn-off to some people, but for a guy like me, that's aaaalllll good! 3. The burger was big! I don't think I need to say anymore about that. 4. The burger was really good.  I mean really, really good.  Ok, I guess at this point you're thinking, \"you're starving! A phreaken Saltine cracker would be delicious!\"  Yes it would, but a nasty cracker is a nasty cracker. Ok, maybe that wasn't a good analogy either... I tried.  Lucky Boy's burgers are veeerrrrry good. They are not super expensive and a bargain in today's $9 burger world.  If you're in Phoenix visiting, give them a shot. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm going back.",

Ecclectic, apparently family owned place that had been highly recommended by a few people that I know.  Therefore I was shocked to find that both of my experiences with Lucky Boy were terribly disappointing.  For one thing, the quality of their ingredients is suspect right from the beginning.  The shredded lettuce that they use was soggy and limp and slightly yellow, the tomato was discolored and had to be dissected and removed from my burger.  The condiments are all off-brand.  The fries seemed not done enough and lukewarm on my first visit, overdone and solid pieces of molten rock the second time.  Both the burger and hot dog that I ordered came with a toasted bun, but the toasting left a greasy aftertaste that ruined the effect.  I'd love to be able to walk across the street and have a burger at Lucky Boy once in a while, but I'll pass.",

Shake was not remarkable but they appear to have lots of flavors, so that might warrant some exploration.

    "text": "Established 1951 and showing every year of it. That's a good thing. Lucky Boy Burger Shop is a classic small burger and shake joint. Sure, there are some inconveniences associated with beaming back to 1951. No free drink refills (35-50 cents to refill). A small dining room. No restroom. A small parking lot that can be difficult to exit. Service can be slow. No worries though. It's all worth it.  The burgers are \"divine,\" at least according to a six year old who accompanied me this visit. I assume it was a new vocab word at school, but I tend to agree anyway. All burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle, unless you request otherwise. You then select one of four options: Lucky Burger (ketchup & mustard), Lucky Original (Tangy Ranch), Lucky International (1000 Island), Lucky BBQ (BBQ sauce). No bad choices here, even though I suspect there is no one in the kitchen calling themselves an executive chef. Then choose a 1/4 lb, 1/2 lb, 3/4 lb or 1 lb burger. Yes, one pound! I've never seen the one pounder, but I can tell you that the quarter pounder is a generous burger and large enough for most folks.   The French fries are wonderful. Not the skinny fast food variety nor the half a seasoned potato thick cut. Classic. Perfectly prepared every time. The onion rings are the uniform chopped onion type, not the kind from which strings of fresh onion emerge as you try to eat them, but they are tasty enough and do the trick. The kids actually prefer them to stringy alternative. The kids have also enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwiches and the corn dogs. They are fans of both the onion rings and the French fries and, of course, sitting on the bar stools in the dining room. Just make sure your little ones bathroom before visiting, since there are no facilities on the premises. Did I mention the shakes and malts? The kids love those too. How could they not with a dozen or so flavors to choose from (cinnamon, peanut butter, banana, butterscotch...)?   Closed Sundays.",

Tell me why I paid over $5.00 for a undercooked, mediocre burger with a small amount of lettuce and pickles.  I also ordered the onion rings, but they proved to be mediocre as well.  Since I don't make a habit of eating pink, undercooked meat this means that I wasted my time and money to drive to Lucky Boy to eat some nasty onion rings for lunch.  Awesome.  I'm beginning to think that it really is an unreasonable expectation that somebody in this f**king town knows how to make some decent food.  *sigh*  In addition, I wasn't able to use my debit card, because their machine was broke.  So, now if I need some cash I have to make an extra trip to the bank.  Thanks again, Lucky Boy, for a great experience from a first time customer.",

    "text": "You can find fancier burgers. You can find more expensive burgers. You can even find faster burgers. But if you want to walk into a quintessential old-school burger stand (Teal! Coral! Glass brick walls!) and get a solid burger that's cooked right and tastes delicious, Lucky Boy is your place.   At under five bucks for a quarter pound cheeseburger with fries, it's cheap, too.   And then there are the milkshakes. If you find yourself disappointed by the three universal options offered elsewhere, you'll rejoice at the menu board here: they've got a handful of great mix-ins (first two are free, and any extras are cheap). My partner and I split a chocolate peanut butter banana shake and it was freakin' fantastic. I could not have asked for anything more perfect from that shake. Hell, stop here for a shake even if you don't want a burger. It's worth it.",

    "text": "This place is 65 years old. Incredible and  makes me happy to buy local and old. It has a very limited standard burger menu. An old school drive through hamburger stand with like three tables inside. The burger was good, not the best I have had in town but delish and pretty darn yummy. Tasted like the burger from the Burger Factory Shop on 15th ave, which I like too. My burger came with a small fries. The only negative is that it had to be the messiest burger I have ever eaten. lol I also got a coconut and pineapple shake to go and that was very good. I think they won best of Phx one year for their shakes. The man behind the counter is pretty friendly once he warms up to you. I would go back for sure.  As a few other reviewers noted, yes they are very picky about no outside food or drink since it is heath code law violation. However, there is a big sign on the door so you can not really plead ignorance. I know a few other reviewers noted this as a reason not to come back and I find that childish. Yes, some other restaurants do overlook the law it but the fact is, it is still illegal and gross. Just leave it in the car folks and stop complaining about it or holding it against the owner who is rule following. Since it is illegal I never in a million years thought it had to do with greed. I do not fault them for that and they have been open since 1950.   I do admit the no refill soda thing is a bit old school and they should reconsider changing that policy. However, other places still charge for refills too so it is not totally unheard of.  Also, the no bathroom might be an issue for some folks. There is always drive through only if you have bathroom issues.",

    "text": "Felt like a burger and wanted something close to downtown.  Decided on this place due to pretty good Yelp reviews.  We drove up and actually parked and went inside. Smallish inside.  A few tables and then bar stools surrounding the perimeter so you can sit and use the counter as a shelf.  Placed my order for a Lucky Boy 1/2lb cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate shake.  Total was just over $10.00.  Nice gentleman working the counter.  I think his wife was manning the grill.  Shake came out first.  Decent sized shake.  It was good (When is a shake not good?) but not great.  Lucky Boy Burger-  (They have 4 \"types\" of burgers here...each one corresponds to the condiments they put on.  Lucky Boy is ketchup and mustard.  See my menu pic for the other \"types\".)  This burger looked great.  It reminded me of little burger joints from LA like Piggies etc.  It came with lettuce, onion and pickle.  It had two 1/4lb patties and 2 slices of cheese.  I bit in and it was good.  The bun was toasted but it also seemed kind of stale.  It almost fell apart on me a few times.  The burger meat was good and I ate the whole thing.  Was it the best burger ever?  Not even close.  Was it good and did it fill a burger craving?  Yes.  Fries-  Standard fries which were salted ok.    Overall this place was A-OK. Supposedly its been here since 1951 which is cool.  I hope people keep on coming back and keep this place in business. Nothing was wrong with it at all but I wasn't blown away by it either.   I would probably try out other burger joints in the area if I ever had a burger craving in this part of town again.    Side rant.............we did get hounded by a dude \"asking\" for change while walking back to our car.  A little Hispanic dude on a bike.  He reeled off about 30 words and then said \"uno dollar\".  That's the only Spanish word I could understand.....here is a tip buddy.  If you are going to beg for change/money in the US, you might want to pick up some English and learn how to say \"Can you spare some change\" or \"Can I have a dollar?\". You will have much better success on obtaining your $$$ that you are seeking ;-) Anyways.............",

Nice and juicy and they were very generous with the toppings. I actually scraped some of the ketchup and mustard off. The fries were great too. But the malt was amazing! SO thick I used the straw as a spoon. Great chocolate flavor, big chunks of banana - yum! The friend said the BBQ burger was also very tasty.  The place itself is small with only 3 tables and a few stools at a counter near the windows but it has a certain charm.  I will definitely be going back to Lucky Boy if for no other reason than to get another malt.",

It's just not that great.  While the fries were thicker cut - several were burned.  My burger's most prominent taste was charcoal, and I'm not talking about that delicious char grilled taste - I mean nasty petroleum tasting burned charcoal.  I may go back again, but with significantly lowered expectations.",

Love these types of burger joints; small holes in the wall serving up hot, fresh burgers, made to order with all the fried goodies on the side.  But alas, twas quality that brought this burger go'er to his knees.  First off, know the burgers come with fries without another mention.  We thought we were getting two burgers and a side of onions rings, but ended up with a double troubles worth of fries with it.  Now, the fries were good, but nothing special, hard to mess up deep fried frozen fries.  The burgers themselves, the normal burger dressings, the bacon, cheese, and even the buns stunk of penny pinching.  Everything was skimped on and quality was lacking.  The people were rude and unwelcoming and we paid too much.  Oh my, the onion rings.  I love onion rings; bar none my favorite side to a good burger and the pics on Yelp had me really craving some delicious ringage.  Wow, these were the worst, cheapest pieces of dirt I have seen since, ever really.  To start with, there were no onions in them.  None.  It was a ring of onion flavored dough or something.  It reminded me of bad Chinese places where you question if there really is meat in what you are eating.  They were terrible and again, smelt of penny pinching.  Sorry, there are much better places then this and the only thing holding up that second star is the fries...",

As food goes the burger is one of those things that couldn't get any more American unless of course you wrapped up a little blond in an American flag and had her working the grill. No matter where you find yourself from Manhattan to Monterey Bay you can always find a burger joint.   In a town rife with everything from exotic grinds of meat to log cabin themes for burger bars, Lucky Boy has a mind boggling simple cheap formula, a non-mad cow burger made with all the of the basic ingredients like onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and assorted other condiments cooked to order on a fresh bun. Toss in some fries, onion rings, maybe even fried mushrooms sprinkle in milkshakes for real pizazz.",

I'd always either just ate, or had to be somewhere quick, and had no time to stop.  A friend and I stopped in yesterday evening and it was like I'd made it somewhere after years of trying. The young girl behind the counter, and whom I'm assuming was her mother were both extremely welcoming and friendly. They asked if it was our first time, told us how to order, and were generally awesome. Service here is perfect.  The place is as you would expect, un-updated 50's inside. It's been there roughly 60 years. There is no music, and no real entertainment factor, so this might be a better place to hit the drive through, but the inside wasn't dirty, it was just boring.   They feature their 1/4 and 1/2 pound burger specials, both of which include a good helping of fries, and are both under $5. They also have about a dozen flavors of shakes and all the typical deep fried goodies. I had the 1/4 with swiss, bacon, and thousand island dressing. It was a really awesome burger, and for just over $4 after tax, it's tough to beat. REALLY tough. It's not Delux, but it is a damn tasty burger.   A good bet for that semi-queasy \"need something to soak up the booze\" day after meal.",

Instead of ketchup and mayo I decided on the \"Lucky's 1000 island\" I thought the burger was cooked perfectly and the grilled bun was a nice compliment.  The Fry's were OK in my book... A little too cooked but still OK.   Definitely going back and definitely talking about this place to others.",

This place screams \"local\", as the only way you would ever stop here is if you've been eating here for years. Not much to look at from the outside, (or inside for that matter) I made my way into the place to find a smallish menu with your usual burger joint fare: burgers, fries, chilli, shakes, etc. Ordered me a single with cheese (fries come with) and a Mexi Coke (nice!).  Certainly a decent burger. The best part about it was probably the soft bun. The burger tasted like a buger and the fixins were what you'd expect. Nothing special in anyway.    The fries certainly are not anything to write home about. Previously frozen and deep fried, I got halfway through my burger before I could start to eat them they were so hot out of the frier.   I will not go out of my way to eat here, but I can also see the appeal of a place like this that conjures memories of buger stands passed....",

Mustard, catchup (Yes, I know not Chicago style, hey that's the way they gave it to me) relish, onions. The condiments looked pretty much like they came out of the bottles. Not fresh. Still good though.   I like the burger choices. I am fan of putting ranch and thousand island on my burgers. These two choices are available along with bbq and whatnot. The burger was cooked good. The sesame buns were fresh. Fries were pretty darn good. They were crunchy and and hot.   The parking lot is extremely small, and only one way out- through the drive thru line... kinda weird.

But I knew that going in and did it anyway.  Where, you ask, can you also clog your arteries and love every precious minute of the experience?  Lucky Boy is the place.  We ordered the quarter pound Lucky International with fries.  I added bacon, green chili and cheese to mine.  It was pure heartburn; I mean heaven, at first bite.  All of the Lucky Boy burgers include lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions, but you can hold any or all of the included condiments.  The Lucky International also includes 1000 island dressing. Was it messy?  Absolutely!  Would I do it again?  Absolutely!  The fries were amazing.  Real cut potatoes with the perfect amount of salt and crispiness.   I also had the small shake, which was really quite large.  They were really good.  You can mix up to two of the 14 flavors for the same price.  But I'm a purist so I stuck with chocolate.  They also have hotdogs, corndogs and grilled cheese for the little ones.  If you're really in a hurry, you can always order to go and they have a drive-thru as well.  There are three reasons why Lucky Boy only gets four out of five stars.  1.  Every little thing you add is an extra, including refills, but it's so inexpensive it's not really a big deal.  2. It was very warm inside.  No A/C.  Maybe that's why the prices are so low. (*Edit to add they do have fans and evaporative cooling so it wasn't too terribly bad.)  3. No restroom to wash my hands afterwards.  These burgers are very messy!  If you ever need a cheap eats night, this would be a great place for it.",

Stick with water and skip the cheese and you can get out of there for under $5 for a burger and fries.   We all had double cheese burgers. I had mine w Swiss cheese. There was cheese on each party, and it melted into the burger perfectly.    I give it four stars as opposed to five because, in my opinion, they could include a drink in the price of the combo. Also, the patties are all performed.",

The prices of the food are fair, cheaper than some other places and great flavor.  It did however take me a while to finally realize this place was open. I wish there was more advertisement or some kind of sign to lure more clientele. I just want more people to try it, since it's so good here. The place does have that old timey feeling, so it appears to be closed if you're just passing by.  But by far an excellent choice for a delicious-flame-broiled-made-at-home-taste-burger!!!",

If you're looking for some comfort food, this is the place to go. You could go through the drive through in your pajamas but you would miss the charm of the little dinner on the inside. They make fresh lemonade, delicious shakes and malts, and all kinds of burgers. However, it might not be the best pick for a vegetarian or vegan. I went outside my normal health box and ate a corn dog, which was all I could have asked for and more. My husband tried the burger and it was better than any fast food burger you will ever have. Before I started moving towards a more plant based diet, I used to be a bit of a burger snob. My friends and I would go to different gourmet restaurants trying to find the BEST burger in Phx. Take a bite out of Phx history and try this place next time you have a burger craving! You will be impressed.",

The price in the photos was once at $3.19 for burger and fries, but now we are at $5 for everything with a slice of cheese.  The fries were crispy, thick and golden brown in style. The 1/4 burger with thousand island was my choice and it was cooked well done as requested. Lucky Boy has served Phoenix since 1951 and this part of town looks mostly unchanged with clear spanish influences taking over. I survived eating in my car down the street because the two dudes in the small seating area were way too loud to enjoy my meal. Homeless folks will hassle you as you go next door to Circle K to save $$ on beverages, but this place is one of those you need to try if you like burgers. Nothing spectactular, but Lucky Boy is clearly equal to and better than the other national chains that you would spend $5 at and the fries and the friendly couple working there make the difference.",

I love 1000 Island on my burgers, so the International is perfect for me. I don't care for cheese on burgers, and the International doesn't come with cheese as standard. The friendly staff will add it to yours if you want it, as well as bacon if that's your thing. The meat is grilled just right with a hint of pink, ensuring its juicy goodness. Standard toppings include lettuce, onion, tomato, and dill pickle chips. Oh, and the french fries come with your burger at no extra charge and aren't greasy at all. The quality and taste of my meal made this a good value, in my opinion. I like my food freshly made and HOT, especially the fries, and that's exactly what I got at Lucky Boy. Will I be returning anytime soon? You bet! These burgers definitely beat In 'n Out Burger, and the fries at Lucky Boy are 'to the moon' better than In 'n Out - no contest. If you want a juicy, delicious, highly satisfying burger for a reasonable price, then this is THE place to go. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I have probably eaten at Lucky Boy about 50 times or more.  You would probably call me obsessed, and that might be an understatement.  Lucky Boy has two of my favorite things, a great burger, and great ranch.  In fact, they have combined them to make probably the best burger in town.  Lucky's signature burger is their ranch burger and it can be ordered in a single (1/4lb), or you can get multiple patties.  Lucky also deep fries their bacon that goes on their burgers.  Yes you heard me, deep fried bacon........I could end the review on that tremendous high note but that would not do justice to how good Lucky Boy is.  Make sure you go during lunch or an early dinner because Lucky Boy closes early.  This is due to the business being run by one of the nicest families you will meet.  From the mom and dad that own the place to their kids that help out, you always get a sense that they not only care for their customers but they care for each other while working together.  So if you are in the neighborhood or running some errands in the central Phoenix area you have to stop by for the best burger in the valley, Lucky Boy.",

I really enjoyed going here, and will be back whenever I get a chance. The food was hot and delicious, with generous toppings. This place reminds of a burger stand I used to love to go to when I lived in the Chicago area (Rosie's, 103rd & Cicero), right down to drive-thru's activity switch.  I had the 1/2lb burger with grilled onions and jalapeno slices, with fries and a large coke. It was $7 and change, and worth every penny. They have plenty of other choices, including many milkshake flavors.",

Meantime I heard from one non-yelper that the quality had dimensioned with the newest ownership.  All I can say is that it was food. And it was warm and I ate in. Was not impressed by anything. Service was quick but not very welcoming. Interior is drab but reasonably clean. They provide no public bathroom which I think should be against the law if they provide an eating area.  I found nothing to die for here, not even that shake. Most likely I won't find reason to return and some people will certainly regret they tried it.",

    "text": "I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.  Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an \"international burger\" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over.   I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind. And that's something....",

We almost didn't get out of the car, however, when we pulled into the back, only to see a group of apparent drug addicts huddled at the side of the Circle K. One woman (?) was alternately pounding a man in the chest, snapping back his head by means of his hair, and then spooning him. Ah, meth. You are truly a showman.  Anyway, when we decided to brave it, it was well worth the risk. The burgers were made from fresh, great quality beef, cooked to almost crispy on the outside, and yet still magically juicy on the inside. Fresh bun and toppings, and absolutely awesome fries. Super hot and wonderfully seasoned. I usually get some heartburn after eating fried foods, but had zero issues with Lucky Boy. We got some shakes to go- I had strawberry and Hubby had peanut butter. They were good, and very thick, but we both agreed that we prefer the more intense flavors of the shakes at the Chicago Hamburger Company.  Will we be back? You betcha. And not just for the \"scared straight\" factor.",

You won't find kobe beef or antelope on the menu, nor some crazy topping like foie gras.  And brace yourself, no sweet potato fries either.  But you will find a pretty damn good burger and fries for under $4!  Who knew they still even existed?  The burger is everything an old-fashioned burger should be, standard with mustard, ketchup, chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion.  And just so you don't forget we're in Arizona, they offer pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  The fries are thick cut and crisp, and they mix a mean milkshake, too.  We ate inside, and yes, it is kind of a dive, but a clean one.  It reminded me of the kind of burger joints that were around when I was a kid.  Yes, they had burgers back then.",

They had some of the better looking homemade burgers I had seen in the area with that nostalgic 50's burger shop type of feel. So we pull up to the parking lot, park our car and start walking towards the order window when we literally get swatted away like a fly with a mouthed \"we're closed\" which excuse the hell out of me, but it was 7:45pm on a Thursday evening and they didn't have their hours closed until 8. It was really disappointing honestly and extremely aggravating. If you don't want your business to stay open until 8, then put your hours online to close sooner so people don't waste their time driving down there. I didn't even get a sorry, or come back tmrw or really any form of empathy. Not to mention they're also closed on Sundays.",

Most places just leave that stuff sitting out, which is alright but I prefer my ketchup cold. This place has sort of a retro look to it. Kind of reminds me of a 50s-era diner. The prices are really good too. I fed myself and four others for under $40. Nice!",

    "text": "An amazing burger shoppe!  I have tried most grease pit joints around the Valley and I am not generous with my reviews unless they deserve five stars. Being a small business owner myself, I always compare how I do business with the way I'm treated by other small business owners. I am somewhat of a perfectionist, so only the best will do when writing a review, unless service is so bad that it requires a sharp note.   I have been a customer at Lucky Boy since I moved in the neighborhood back in 2008. I believe they've been in the Valley for over six decades, and that says a lot about their product. Burgers are charbroiled in the tradition of homemade burgers that is completely lost nowadays in 'fast food' joints. Usually burger means just the meat patty, but I highly recommend you add cheese and bacon.   There are a few add ons to choose from, so you won't feel like you're short changed, but all the add ons are extras, so your five dollar burger may end up being an eight dollar burger in no time. This is one place where you can order burgers in 1/4lb increments. Yes, you can order a 1lb burger if you're curious or hungry. That beast is hard to bite into, but worth ordering for your birthday or anniversary :)  The fries are actually cut up potatoes, not frozen potato product like most fast food places. Reminds me of In'n'out, except these fries actually have a flavor and don't look like they've been bleached. Fries are always freshly cooked. I take mine with no salt, because I use my own savory salt at home.   Finally, no burger joint is complete without a milk shake, and these guys have the real thing. I am 100% sure my banana shake actually contained bananas, not banana-flavored imitation crap. I plan on getting other flavors to complement the palate. I'd say I haven't had a shake this wholesome since the early 90s, when I had a date shake at Dateland in Baghdad, Arizona.   Overall, I'd say this is an excellent choice for burger aficionados. I haven't dined in so I can't comment on that experience, but the drive-through is open till 8pm, so make a quick stop to your new favorite burger joint! Enjoy, y'all!",

The bun is also high quality and toasted crunchy to perfection. Many different condiment selections and specialty burger types. They also have good thick cut fries, onion rings, fried zucchini, mushrooms, and hot poppers. This burger is $4.95 including the fries, so a good solid value. Taste and quality of the food here beats the pants off of McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, and Whataburger IMO. Also the shakes are very good. You can choose two flavors from a long list of items so we chose pineapple & coconut and had a pina colada Shake. It had a lot of actual fruit in it.",

I remember the days when the original owner was there, and the business owned a larger piece of the surrounding property.  The larger location allowed them to host car shows on Saturday nights, and there was outside seating too.  Anyway, enough of the history lesson....    The food always has been and remains delicious!  Get in there and load up on a burger and fries, but make sure you save room in your boiler for one of their insane shakes!  My favorite is the peanut butter shake.  There are a few Phoenix dining institutions I pray never close their doors, and this is definitely one of them!",

You can see them cooking in the back and the burger has good flavor and feels quite substantial. Fries are included and they're passable, I just prefer thinner and crispier fries.

Was not disappointed at all, i ordered a Lucky Boy burger with some fries and a regular Dr. Pepper. Fries were hot off the fryer, crunchy and soft in the middle. Nice amount of salt to make it very tasty.  The burger, THE BURGER!! I love charbroiled burgers, it gives it a nice char taste, damn very yummy. Only thing is that they added a tidbit to much catsup, but it was fine after i almost finished it. WOW burger was big, filled my Big Ass up, lol  Will go back and have a taste of some of the other items on the menu.",

Lucky Boy is all about superb classic American burgers - real ingredients, great flavor, not overpriced. I usually get the international burger with fries - $3.69 or something, and it's not only filling, it's absolutely delicious. Their menu is large, and allows for lots of customization. They have a large offering of milkshakes, malts, hotdogs, different variations of toppings for your burger, other fried appetizers, along with plenty of other options to keep you eating. So tasty. So good. So incredible.   I recommend Lucky Boy to my all my friends and they always say \"oh, that little place near the corner??\" It's as if everyone knows it's there, but few rarely ever give it a try. Why? -I don't know.  Just because a restaurant isn't in a prominent locale or on a big-scene streetcorner does NOT mean it's any reason to ever avoid the place. I promise you, this will be the most delicious burger you'll find in Phoenix in the fast-food market. It's unbelievable, and ought not to be missed.",

If you order a 1/2 lb burger it's two patties, a double whammy.    They have three or four custom choices for the style in which they'll prepare you burger.  Basically it's like a ranch burger, a thousand island burger, a bbq burger or a mustard and ketchup burger.  Choose one.    Peanut butter-anything shakes are good.  I've had it with Butterfinger and butterscotch and chocolate.  It's all good.  Their fries are good as well.  It's super cheap like $5 for a burger and fries.  Go here.

The burgers are charbroiled, not fried, which is good. You can only eat so many fried burgers.   The fries were just ok which knocked off one star, but I'm definitely going to go back and try them again (fries can be hit-or-miss).  Overall, very satisfied. Taste, quantity, price all good!",

Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to details, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs.

The burgers are more reminiscent of the old days of greasy burgers that had LOTS of flavor.  The onions and lettuce are diced on the bottom of the bun which I love.  The fries are a toss between steak fries and reg (so a little thicker).  The staff is always friendly and quick too.  Never had my order made wrong and I customize mine a little.  I do buy soda at the Circle K since you can get a 44oz drink for 86 cents (and I like Diet Pepsi).   Highly recommend this place.

Oh yea the fries are always piping hot made to order as well.",

The staff are great folks and the food very tasty and no hesitation about making sure you get what you want on your burger.  Much better than any of the franchise joints around town and your business is really appreciated.  It is not a fancy place, but you get a great burger for a very fair price. You really can't ask for more.  Go, eat and be happy!  Highly recommended!!!",

    "text": "Lucky Boy!!!  I knew I had it once or twice as a teenager, and I guess back then I didn't even understand how awesome it was, even though I liked it.  I went there with my soon-to-be wife a month or two ago after getting the first ultrasound of our baby, and it was magical. We were so hungry from being in the medical office, and we wanted something REAL. Lucky Boy makes REAL burgers. The way they are meant to be made. If you like the taste of backyard barbecue burgers, and you aren't on the roster of any upcoming barbecues, you should go to Lucky Boy. They are grilled to perfection, and we have only tried the Double Lucky International because it is the best. :) It has 1000 Island Dressing, and it STOMPS In-n-Out. We came from being as enthusiastic about In-n-Out as we are now about Lucky Boy. It changed our hearts forever. We also like the touch of retro that it has about it.  I will also mention that no other burger joint serves them bigger than Lucky Boy.  My last piece of advice: Don't forget the fries, they are ALSO THE BEST. Better than any fast food fries out there, they are not all dry and over-potatoey like some 'more natural' fries. They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They give you the perfect amount. They don't need ketchup, and they salt them for you (which is apparently unheard of these days).  All this magical yumminess that we share together every now and again because it is enough for two, and it is only $7. That includes the double patties too (which is an add-on).  ***P.S. We REALLY want to try their shakes, which have an extensive amount of flavors, and you can mix more than one if you want!",

The service was fast, but I wish they would have given me a heads up about the sizes of everything. I got a large shake to share and the two of us couldn't finish it, but my double cheeseburger wasn't very big. In my opinion their fries were too salty and my burger was charred and had a weird grease taste, almost rancid. That being said, I'll give them another shot now that I know what to order and what to specify, you can tell that the owners and employees really care about this place.",

I took a peek at the reviews and was shocked to see that this place is a 4 star with 153+ reviews. I made a u-turn and tried them out.  At first, the math didn't add up. I was charged $9.33 when I should have been charged $8.21. I didn't make a fuss because I wanted to try the food first because sometimes being overcharged doesn't matter if you get a good value.  I ordered the international half pound burger with fries and a coke. The burger was absolutely perfectly cooked, and the sauce was just right - not too much and not too little. The fries tasted unsalted, which is probably a good thing, and doesn't matter too much to me because I basically use fries as edible ketchup spoons.  All together the food was absolutely perfect and the customer service was excellent. They are super friendly. I even got to chatting with them about how I've driven by this place dozens of times and would have never came in if it wasn't for Yelp.  I would have given 5 stars, but I don't think I got $9.33 in value.  With that said, try this place! I can see myself coming here too often.",

    "text": "At the request of a coworker, who heard on the radio that today is \"National Cheeseburger Day\", I went to pick up lunch. Here is a transcript of my stream of consciousness:  [pull into the parking lot at 16th Street and Osborn] Wow. This place is behind a gas station, and it looks exactly like a place behind a gas station. Gulp. Oh man, hepatitis-on-a-stick. But I can't back out now because our order is called in and Coworker is so super excited about trying this place out. Okaaay...  [open the door to the shack/restaurant. It's small and nearly packed, which makes sense because there were hardly any parking spots left. There are several people working behind the counter and at the grill, and the first thing that strikes me is how jubilant and friendly they are]  \"Hello! You're at Lucky Boy! What can we get you today?\" [Everyone is smiling. Like genuinely smiling from real happiness, not the I'm-smiling-because-management-makes-me]  I'm taken aback because the staff is so happy despite having less than 100 square feet of work space, in a building that, from the outside, looks like it was abandoned. I pay for the order (cheap!), turn the greasy doorknob and go back to my car. On the drive back to work I pull out a French fry and it is HOT. Like good hot from well-cared-for oil. Not just hot because it was recently out of the fryer. Eat enough fast food, and food in general, like I do and you can tell the difference.   Larger than most fast food fries, I eat the first French fry. It is crispity-crunchy on the outside and warm and potato-y on the inside. Mmmmmmmm. These are some unique fries. I take to holding one at a time in front of the a/c to before eating it slowly.   Back in the break room, we enjoy \"Lucky International 1000 Island\" 1/4 lb. burgers and a side of mushrooms. The proportion of meat, bun, lettuce, 1000 Island and pickles was perfect. The mushrooms were good but hard to judge because I knew they were degraded from the drive back to the office. I conclude that the food is enjoyable, and it is obvious that it would be REALLY GOOD if we ate it on site. I'm excited about returning, om nom nom!",

    "text": "We are in absolute LOVE with this little \"Mom & Pop\" burger shop! The only downside we've noticed is the fact they aren't open when we suddenly get the urge for an extremely well-done meal.  It's almost always: 1/4 lb BBQ Lucky Burger for my boyfriend and the 1/4 lb charbroiled chicken sandwich for me. Lucky Boy has the BEST fries in Phoenix - we could make a meal out of the fries alone!!!  The first time we went there, dubiously, because we hadn't tried the fare - when we pulled up to the menu, we were both amazed at how simple and straightforward it is; first time through - a cherry shake. OMG! It was like frozen cherry-flavored heaven in a cup. Thick and very cherry, it was probably the BEST thing we both put in our mouths that day. ;o)~  We decided that since the shake was extra delicious (we shared a medium - was NOT disappointed - perfect size for two, too much for just one) that we'd go back and this time get real FOOD.  He got the Lucky Boy burger and so did I. We also purchased mushrooms which put us over the edge - it was SO. MUCH. FOOD.   The second time we got the 1/2 lb Lucky Boy BBQ burger for him and the charbroiled chicken for me, no mushrooms this time - instead, we opted for an order of fries. Got up to the window to pay and receive our food and the guy inside said: \"You know the burgers come with fries, right?\" I smiled, nodded, and said, \"Yes, thank you. We'd still like another order.\" He kind of shrugged his shoulders, took my money, and said, \"Okay...\"  A few minutes later, he appeared back at the window with TWO bags of food... literally, one held our burgers and fries, the other was \"BAG 'O FRIES!!!\" I think we kind of overdid it that time... didn't expect THAT many fries. Live and learn, right? We ate dinner at home then basically lay back in our respective chairs bemoaning the fact that \"Holy Hannah! That's A LOT of fries!!!\"  We've since turned this into 'go-to' place every Saturday. It's the one place we've decided will definitely get our business on Saturdays after we've done the antiquing, shopping, and doing what \"old\" people do on their weekends.  My suggestion? Go to LUCKY BOY at least once in your life. The place is small, the drive-thru is tight, there's no restroom, but the FOOD - oh, the food! If I could, they'd get TEN stars!!!",

    "text": "As I walked up to this classic looking burger stand in Phoenix I put an image in my head. I told myself I wanted the burger special with cheese. I also said I wanted it to have shredded lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. This is exactly what I got open flame grilled burger, grill toasted bun for unparalleled flavors.  Reminded me of a burger stand from my childhood.  Oh and for some odd reason I pictured a squeeze bottle for the ketchup. When. The fries came out the squeeze bottle was their next to them. No nasty pump of warm ketchup from fresh from the fridge, clean and full.  All in all a delicious little spot. See you again soon!",

Sure you can get a Fancy Burger, [Hopdoddy is good for that] but this is different.  They've been doing it since 1951!!!  I got a huge burger and as recommended, got the 1000 island dressing as my sauce.  I got a big bag of super crispy, perfect fries too, and it was $6.69.  Yikes what a deal.  I had a great conversation with the owner and his team and they have that 'simple and relish' thing and attitude down pat!  TRY THIS NOW!",

    "text": "Went here yesterday after several friends raving about it and seeing mixed reviews. Very disappointed. If you want to skip the details, skip the copy cat of Lennys and actually go to the Lennys on Central and Thomas, it's only 5 minutes away. Not worth trying.  My wife ordered a 1/4lb w onion rings instead of fries (which he said was possible, pretty sure it was the owner), I ordered a 1/2lb with cheese with fries, and a large drink. It was $16 and change. First I thought there's no way having looked at their prices which are very reasonable, then thought well things add up. So I paid. Come to find out as I'm adding it on my phone as I wait for my food (as it was bothering me), the cashier basically just charged full price for the onion rings and we didn't get the fries. So that's annoying considering we paid for the fries anyways and didn't get them. Granted we wouldn't have eaten them but still, if you can't upgrade to onion rings for the difference then you can't say you can get them instead of fries. Charging full price for them and trying to hide it is shady.  The service was friendly, there was no one there, so the food came out quick. My wife's burger was cooked normally but her bun was stale and it had only a few shreds of lettuce. My burger was the same only my bread was REALLY stale. The 1/2lb is two patties so requires a little \"squishing\", the bread was too stale to do this effectively. I'm not a complainer so I ate it. As far as the burger goes, seriously very chincy on the produce which helps make the burger, and the burger was eh, no taste other than grease, no seasoning, not juicy. Boring. Not even in the ballpark of the best fast burger in town. Shouldn't even be on the radar.  Fries are decent, pretty sure they are the same as Lennys. Onion rings (12 per order) are nothing special, concerned a lot of other users say they are the best they have had. Perhaps this is really good \"beer food\". ????  No refills on soda. Come on. Even Lennys (that they are copying) does refills for free or $0.50 depending on location. Soda syrup is so cheap it's insane.   Knowing that we wouldn't be returning. It wanted to get the full experience as others really enjoyed the shakes. I was feeling fat from my uneventful burger, so I got a small Butterfinger shake. We took this to go and this was really good. Prices about average for the size.  So all in all, unless you want a quick drive through, skip this place and go to Lennys. Same menu but smaller without the taste.",
