    "text": "Absolutely horrible coffee. I ordered their traditional breakfast: 2 eggs, hashbrowns, muffin and added sausage. All were decent except the sausage. It tasted like it was freshly microwaved from the freezer.  Scenery: about what you'd expect, plain, looks like any other breakfast nook. The only thing notable was the very attractive female servers dressed as cowgirls. Considering it's close to Halloween, I'm not sure if that's part of their regular attire though.  The service was efficient and pleasant enough.  For the price you pay and quality of food, you'd be better served by hitting the ihop up the street.",

We have been back 4 or 5 times now, and the service is always wonderful. The food is really good too. My husband loves the protein pancakes. I love the eggs & bacon (they're always cooked perfectly). I also really liked the California eggs Benedict.   I think the thing that really sets this place apart from other restaurants that offer standard breakfast food is the service. Not only are the servers always nice and helpful, but the bussers are also really quick and seem very happy. Happy staff, great food, convenient location. Oh and I saw a sign that said they now serve alcohol, which I imagine some folks (not myself) might enjoy with breakfast.",

And the hash browns were barely cooked, so the result was a pile of mush on my plate, not even slightly crispy.  The entire menu is pricey, especially for the poor quality of food.  Over 20 bucks for 2 people, just entrees, not even a drink.  This place is always busy, which I don't understand because their food sucks.  They told us 10 minutes, and 25 minutes later we were seated.  It took forever for our waitress to come and take our order and for our food to come out.  I am giving them 2 stars because my husband did enjoy the Idaho Hot Skillet of the Half & Half.  He didn't like the other half, which was pancakes.  If it wasn't for the skillet, I would have given them only 1 star.",

We frequently eat at the location on Mill and Baseline to celebrate various holidays with family. i.e. birthdays, graduation, easter, etc. The location off of Mill is quite small so we were excited to see how open and modern this new location was designed.   Upon arrival, we were greeted cheerfully and seated right away. Our server was very friendly and chatty, but in a good way. She took our drink orders right away and brought us back out beverages and pitchers to refill our drinks as we please. We ordered pumpkin waffles and the california benedict. The pumpkin waffle was heaven on earth! I recommend opting for whipped cream with no syrup. You won't be disappointed! And as usual, the california benedict was amazing. It's eggs benedict with bacon, avocado and tomato... so flipping good. At the end of the meal, the server even offered to-go cups for drinks. I always think this is a nice gesture.  I will certainly be coming back to this location and would recommend giving it a shot.",

Anyway, we ordered a couple of omelettes and tried to \"health\" them up a bit...we can't eat carbs so we tried to substitute fruit for our english muffin and tomatoes for the potatoes, and take off the cheese.  Well, one came with the cheese, and we were upcharged for the fruit.  The ingredients were placed in the omelette like a sandwich...not actually cooked in the omelette.  The omelette (egg) was small and not very fluffy.  I don't think we should have to pay extra for trying to eat healthy, and the fruit that was provided was certainly not worth the upcharge.  Our server seemd constantly distracted, but she was reasonably pleasant when engaged.  We have had a much better experience at Good Egg on Ray Road.  Overall...a disappointment and we probably won't return unless the menu and the food gets \"re-tooled\" a bit to help those who want to have healthy choices without being penalized.",

    "text": "This place recently opened near my house, and I love good breakfast food, so I was hoping for it to be excellent.  The first thing I noticed when being seated was that the silverware at our table wasn't entirely clean.  Not a good start.  Overall there weren't too many people in the restaurant (4 or 5 tables while I was there), and there seemed to be quite a few servers.  Our drink order was taken quickly, but took a while to fill.  I got a coffee, and asked for cream when it came out, which also took longer than I would have expected to get.  I ordered \"Corned beef hash\", and when the food came out, they brought me a \"Corn huskers\", which is apparently another dish with sausage instead of corned beef.  They took the dish back to resolve the issue and apologized for the mistake.  When it came back out, I am pretty sure they just exchanged the sausage with corned beef on the plate, but since part of the dish was eggs over easy, by this time the eggs were cold.  The dish came with toast, which did not come out with it (Even with the delay), and I feel like if I didn't remind the server, I would not have gotten (Although I could be wrong).  There was also hashbrowns and the corned beef.  Neither were bad per-say, but they were both definitely on the bland side.  I feel like each of the issues I had with this place were small, and could have easily been overlooked on its own (Except maybe the bland food, but I could have tried something different).  The problem was that there were just SO many of them.  The one redeeming factor about the place was that everyone was very friendly.  When the one redeeming factor about a place is not the food, it is hard to justify giving it another try :(.",

This location is quite big inside and was very slow on a Monday morning. This was perfect for our needs since our service was fast - food came out quickly! Everyone was very nice.   I have to eat gluten free (Celiac), and I didn't do much research on this place before I came (like I said it was a last minute decision). So to be safe, I ordered 2 scrambled eggs, side of bacon, and side of fruit. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the sides! I got 4 big pieces of bacon and a mound of fruit! The eggs were bland, but that's how I ordered them. They were cooked well though. As I was leaving, I noticed a sign that said they are now serving gluten free pancakes and waffles!! Bummer I didn't notice it before or else I may have tried them. Can't comment to how they taste.   My friends got non-gluten free protein pancakes, apple cinnamon pancakes, and french toast. They said everything tasted good. This place isn't going to knock your socks off for breakfast/brunch, but we didn't leave disappointed either. The pancakes are BIG!! It comes with 2 large pancakes (the size of the plate). You could easily share that and another egg dish between 2 people.",

My Sunday morning breakfast was the traditional breakfast with a side order of bacon cooked exactly they way I asked.  Both breakfast were tasty, actually I have no complaints about my 2 breakfasts.  While other customers may feel otherwise, breakfast at u.s.egg is a must for me and I know I will return next year for my annual visit for Spring Training",

These glasses are tiny (about 12 oz or less). Your waiters/waitresses most fo the time are congregating near restroom area and talking. Maybe just waiting on food order from kitchen but doesn't look good. Food wait time is not good or bad but wait seems to be longer than usual. Food taste is average like any iHOP.  Please do something about the glasses",

Service was so friendly and the manager came over to tell us about how they locally source many of their food items and have fresh squeezed juice.   Was delicious.    Today we opted for the chandler location.  We arrived and many tables were wide open but the seating hostess decided to trot us all the way to the very back.   One of my pet peeves!  So we asked to be moved closer to the middle and we received attitude.  So here's the deal I will come back again but please treat your guests with respect.  Had they been packed with no tables left then fine.  But there was no reason to take us all the way to the back.",

I've only been here for breakfast (they do have a lunch menu as well) and I have yet to order something that I ended up not liking. Their indoor dining room is pretty large, and they also have some outdoor patio seating as well. The parking lot isn't huge, but it gets the job done.  I generally go with one of their omelets. They come with a large side of hash browns and an English muffin. They also have excellent protein pancakes which almost taste too good to be True.  One word of note... make sure you get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait for a table. It's definitely a popular place!",

    "text": "I don't know if it's bad luck or what, but every time I come here I always get very bad service from the waiting staff. Every time that I have come with one of my friends, it has been pretty empty in the restaurant. Yet still, we have waited almost 20 minutes to even get greeted by a server and even longer for drink refills. The server that we get either doesn't care enough to provide even the minimum amount of good customer service (and I am not a picky, mean, or difficult diner whatsoever) or they take our plates away before we even finish our food. It's very weird and awkward to say the least. Almost embarrassing since we have never had a bad experience with the food thus far.  For example, the other day when my friend and I were dining in for breakfast, we waited about 15 mins for a server to come greet us in an almost empty restaurant. Meanwhile, the waiting staff was laughing and gossiping up front instead of actually checking to see if anyone needs help or how their experience is. A random server/manager/whatever that works there decided to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and that our actual server would be right over. When he comes back with the drinks, our server just shows up and asks us if we are ready to order. NO NAME, NO GREETING, NOTHING. Her service was horrendous to say the least even after that defining moment. Surprised I even tipped for that. But I am not the type of person to stiff a waiter or waitress. Needless to say, I probably won't be coming back here.",

We placed our order, and about the time we wondered what was taking so long our food came out.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles, my wife had the California Benedict. We were both pleased with the way our food was prepared. It was clearly freshly made and not sitting around waiting for us to show up (i.e. McDonald's). It is a clean restaurant, well lit with very clean restrooms. The only thing that wasn't pleasant about the atmosphere was the music, a little too loud and Country. However if you like Country (we don't), it'll be great for you.       Overall it was a great place, and we would go there again. Even though the food is a bit on the more pricey side.

The protein pancakes is a whole wheat cake with blueberries, granola and cinnamon. The perfect combo of slight sweetness, but not overwhelming at all. Their coffee is also super good! I bought a bag for myself. I got the chicken fried steak which was delicious , I enjoyed that it was breaded rather than battered. My friend got the Hawk Eye omelet with a few modifications, which were all executed with no issues. Her omelet had chicken pieces in it, which is always a bit risky lol, but she said it was delicious and the bacon in her omelet was cooked well. Members of management were circulating the dining room to check on the guests, which is always nice. And to top it all off, Carrie was our waitress and she was PHENOMENAL. So sweet & cute, very patient with our questions, offered great suggestions, and overall awesome service. We even overheard her being just as courteous and sweet with her other guests, loved it! Good job, US Egg! We will be back!",

    "text": "I love eating at the U.S. Egg in Tempe, was in the Chandler area, and wanted to start off the new year right by eating at a good breakfast spot! A lot of other people had the same idea as we did and when we arrived around 11:30 there was about a 15 minute wait which wasn't too bad since there are several benches people can use to sit and chill. It also gave us time to browse through the menu and pick out our food.  I got my old standby, the half and half: 2 normal sized protein pancakes (Versus the flying saucer sized ones that come with a full order) and a skillet of your choice. My favorite skillet is the chicken bacon because of the mixture of ingredients and flavors. It was served with one egg (Ordered poached today). It was made very quickly, especially considering the high volume of customers in the restaurant today, and tasted great. The protein pancakes were slightly crispy with a hearty mixture of batter, oats, a touch of cinnamon, and blueberries. A full mound of butter and some thick maple syrup were the accompaniments. The skillet was equally as pleasing, with a filling amount of chicken, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese. The only slight negative was that there was a very slim amount of paste-like avocado mixture on the skillet. In other versions I've had they normally give you a few slices of avocado.  Service was decent considering there were so many people eating here today, and I appreciated that the server left us a whole pitcher of iced tea and a whole carafe of coffee so we could serve our own refills.   The actual atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to the Tempe location, except the Chandler restaurant seems to be able to seat more people.  Overall a good place for breakfast!",

Had veggie eggs Benedict.  Avocado slices were black at the ends, spinach had spoiled before cooking.  Slimy black leaves among bright green.  Really unpleasant mess.   Eggs old enough or so small there were no whites to savor.  Server did not ask how I wanted the eggs.  They came overcooked .  Mentioned and quietly showed her spoiled veggies so she could let someone in the kitchen know, and was told the spinach 'had been cooked'. She could not have cared less.  Inedible for $8.99.  Better food quality can be found at any IHOP.  Better quality control can be found at any McDonalds.  Lesson, if they need a sign spinner don't eat there!  Not even breakfast.",

We noticed our food was taking a while and no sign of our server Emily, 40 minutes passed by and finally we get our food to find out our over medium eggs were over cooked and our food was ridiculously cold (really). The host/supervisor who sat us came by and noticed the disappointment and took care of another order of food. There goes another 20 mins to get our food. We didn't order anything special out of the menu. It was so frustrating seeing people come in and leave while we were still waiting for our food. But I guess it we got a great deal because they took care of our \"coffees\" after freaking wasting a damn hour for our food. I work in the service industry and they could have done better than just coffees. Emily tried to apologize many times and the girl did her best. I tipped her her 20% because many times is not the servers fault but shame on management.",

It is a family run business that myself and my family have been going to for years and all the locations are consistent with their service and food quality. I know for a fact those reviews are super fake and need to be taken down. The restaurant is the Gebran family's life and they treat all their customers like gold and don't let people leave unhappy like that. The food is super delicious the protein pancakes are so bomb and memorable. The prices reflect the quality of food you get and I have eaten and the Good Egg and IHOP and they're not even on the same level as the U.S. Egg. They have been in business forever if they really sucked so bad they wouldn't have lasted. Don't buy into the bad hype try it for yourself get a half and half or a triple play with protein pancakes and turkey sausage and see for yourself",

Obviously I was done and even had my credit card sitting out.  Just when I was thinking I just had a bad waitress - 3 bus boys walked by and no one cleared my plate.  In fact, 2 empty glasses sat there throughout my entire meal (the one refill I did get).  There were people waiting, yet the host who was 10 feet away from me couldn't pick up on the clues that I was ready to go and getting irritated.  This tells me that the service problem is bigger than one waitress.  Perhaps this is a management problem.  The food was in no way worth $12.84.  This was my first and last visit to this restaurant.

She has great food suggestions and makes sure we have Exactly what we want, quickly. Today wasn't as busy as usual, so we asked about her beautiful tattoos. She told us about her family and what they meant. I love that she brings them to work with her in such an artful way. We really appreciate her  The staff building relationships with customers is obviously important to management and owners. We have NEVER had an incorrect order. We've been going to the Chandler location for 4 years. This is our \"Go To\" place for our quick breakfast dates with no kids and healthy, delicious food brought to us by people we enjoy being around.",

The building looks kind of plain from the street and it's really easy to just drive on by.  But, after reading some other reviews I decided to venture over here for breakfast for the first time in mid-August, and am so glad I did.  On our first visit my husband had the Cornhusker ($13.99) and I had the avocado and jack omelet ($11.89), plus bacon ($1.25), with a side of fruit ($1.25).  Their coffee is $2.99 and DELICIOUS!!  Some of my favorite breakfast food places have terrible coffee.  Not this joint.  The coffee is slightly nutty and has a smooth flavor.  Love it.  Taylor was our server and everything was perfectly delicious on the first visit.  So we went back for a second visit this past weekend and this time I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon ($9.49) plus a side of avocado (.95) and my husband had the Triple Play ($10.99) with the protein pancakes (.95).  Delicious all over again.  This time Grace was our server.  They have some happy, friendly people working here.  I love that, and once you're inside, it's a bright, pleasant space.  I had no idea from just cruising by before that it would be so nice on the inside.  U.S. Egg has become a new favorite breakfast place for us and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.",

Had a 7oz grilled chicken patty, egg beater eggs, spinach and tomatoes, with coffee. I also asked for some fruit on the side.  The meal was generally good , the chicken was just average and the fruit had items I could not eat ( only the apples and orange slices were in my diet) The biggest shock however was getting a bill for $25.00.!! the coffee was $3.00 and the fruit was I believe close to $6.00. That made the main meal $14.00. Never had a basic breakfast cost so much. That breakfast should have cost $15.00.   Since this visit I have been to 5 other breakfast places including Snooze, First watch, Black Bear , IHOP and Butterfield's and the prices were between $13.00 and $18.00 for basically the same items I got at US Egg which cost $25.00. They should lower their prices !!!",

We were lucky not to wait long for a table and that our server was attentive but to be quite honest, nothing really made our visit there memorable. Sounds terrible but the best thing about my meal was the fact that our server left the water pitcher and coffee thermos on the table for us so we wouldn't have to wait for refills. That's something on my wish list for every restaurant as I drink a ton of water.  Anyway, the customer service was good. We didn't have to wait for a table and we didn't have to wait long for our food. Portions were huge but food was overall mediocre. Eggs were a bit bland and the hash browns were a bit soggy. I liked the decorations; they were really patriotic. My favorites were the huge map of America marking all of their locations and a U.S. flag made out of egg cartons. Other than that, I'd survive not ever eating at U.S. Egg again.",

The waitress that sat us down was personal and friendly. We were immediately asked for our drinks and brought them shortly after. My fiancee had the chicken skillet and I had the half and half with protein pancakes and Santa Fe skillet.

The food was not so excellent.  I had the Denver omelet and my hubby had corned beef hash.  The breakfasts come with hash browns and a toasted, already buttered English muffin. However, the hash browns tasted like they were prepared in a large batch and kept in a warming pan until served.  They were not particularly tasty and lacked the flavorful crunchiness of freshly cooked potatoes.  The omelet was just okay, nothing special with crunchy green peppers and sauteed onions, diced ham inside.  There was a small amount of cheese on the top, but noticeably lacking inn the interior.  My hubby commented that  the corned beef has could have been more appealing, but enjoyed the fresh tomatoes served with the meal.  I don't know if it is the glass/plastic serving plates they used, but the food was cold before we were half way through it.  They might want to consider placing the hot food on plates that hold the heat a little bit better.  I have to agree with another reviewer regarding the coffee cup size and the coffee, but at least it was hot and the carafe left on the table was enough for the two of us.  The restaurant was filling rather quickly, but still no one waiting in line at 8:40 when we left.  Thumbs up for the service. Needs improvement for the food.  At $25 for the two meals and 2 cups of coffee, we probably will look for another place for better food.",

    "text": "I've been to this location a few times now and I plan on going back again and again. Contrary to prior reviews I have always received excellent service! The young ladies that wait tables here are beautiful as well as extremely sweet and attentive. I always feel like I'm an old family friend when I come here.  I've had the opportunity to try quite a few dishes here. The breakfast sandwich with a side of fruit is delicious! It is a generous amount of fresh food for under $10! (the fruit isn't even cut until I order it)  I've also had the traditional breakfast with eggs, hashbrowns and bacon. When I first read the reviews about the hashbrowns not being crispy I was shocked, maybe a simple remedy for the other customers could be to simply ask for \"crispy hashbrowns\" as I did and they would be more than happy with their outcome. I've also enjoyed the ever popular half and half. This is a small (but still generous) stack of their famous protein pancakes (blueberry, granola, cinnamon and almonds) and a half skillet of your choice. I chose the ham, sausage and mushroom skillet, the ham is diced and thick, the sausage juicy and the mushrooms lightly sauteed with a layer of hashbrowns at the bottom. I like to switch it up with the half and half and get strawberry pancakes from time to time at no charge!  I honestly don't understand why this place doesn't have five stars! I'm baffled. The managers are also so attentive, I've seen them checking on every table in the place, which gives you ample opportunity to speak up if your food ie: hashbrowns or eggs are not to your liking. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to improve your experience. Seriously people speak up and stop being so picky!",

I have been in three times and all three were pleasant experiences.  The first time I ordered OJ and the protein pancakes.  The OJ was not fresh but it was fine.  The protein pancakes were excellent.  Service was slow for the drinks but fast for the food.  Everything was warm and cooked well.   The second time I went with two friends and ordered the two eggs breakfast with wheat toast.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns.  Both could have used some more salt and pepper but I was able to add that.  Service was good, a little slow but manageable.  The last time I went with my two kids and husband.  I ordered the same breakfast as above and it was good.   The place is brand new and clean.  My biggest complaint is the uniforms.  I am all for trendy but the tight. short shorts need to go.  My waitress shorts should not be shorter than her apron.   Jeans would be much more professional.   Compared to my others options this one is rated on top.  Also the last two times I have gone the place has been crowded.  I think they are working out the kinks of being new and this will be a good breakfast place.",

My most recent visit on 9/23/15 will be my last. My brother & I were out & decided to grab some brunch. Since this was the closest breakfast/lunch establishment in vicinity to my house I picked US EGG.  Our server was Caitlin. She was unpleasant  from the beginning & we initially ignored it. But as time went on, her attitude could no longer be ignored. The interesting thing is she didn't treat her other tables the way she treated ours. She didn't even bother to check on us once she brought our orders. Once we were done & she came to bring the bill, she had the nerve to ask if we needed anything else! I guess it's a miracle to find decent service anymore. Needless to say, she received no tip & I'm now yelping 1 star. The food is overpriced for the quality & the selection is very limited. My advice, stay home & eat a bowl of cereal.",

The flavors on the skillet were amazing. But the protein pancakes were so freakin good!! Probably the best protein pancakes that I've had, for sure.

I've dined at the Tempe & Chandler locations many times. Each time was magnificent!  If you visit on a Saturday, Sunday, or Holiday, between 10:00 AM to Noon, be prepared to wait approximately 10-20 minutes. Trust me, the wait is WORTH IT! This business has, \"cracked the code\" on how to do BREAKFAST! Crack it, whip it & flip it! They do it the BEST! From eggs to pancakes to everything on their menu - they work it!  Stephanie was our server today - she was fantastic! Brittany, the front-end manager, visited us to make sure our dining experience met our expectations. We had a wonderful time here! Together, Stephanie and Brittany serve this business well; both are bright-eyed, energetic young ladies who are motivated and thorough!  The menu U.S. Egg offers has a TON of diverse meal options! Check their website for the most current menu! Our food was delicious, the portion size generous and the price decent. The atmosphere in general is both relaxed and energizing! Everything was very clean and tidy; everyone smiles here!  I can't say enough about this business - another solid 5-star review! Thank you U.S. Egg! Keep Cracking, Whipping & Flipping!!! May the Lord bless you and keep you, make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.",

But the super service made up for it!",

    "text": "Stephanie was our waitress. Lovely lady. She gave us really good recommendations. My husband ordered half and half (pancakes and a ultimate skillet) and I had the chicken fried steak. She actually lost her sheet with our order but came back and she realized she actually had it memorized which was super impressive.   She brought us a pitcher of iced tea and water. My husband goes through quite a bit of tea and ice. Their water and tea are really good, tasted like they filter their water.   You can tell this place is well run because it was packed and there were a lot of people waiting but their wait time was only 10 min. We got in within 8 minutes or something.   I would come back in a heart beat next time we are up here.",

    "text": "This place first opened a few years ago near my job it was the ideal meeting location for breakfast and seem to be great.  Whether you are traveling for work nearby or looking for a morning start meal, they have  Wi-Fi available and plenty of table space (just ask the staff and crew for the password). Overall I give the US Egg 3 1/2 star rating as it's pretty good. I kept it simple just pancakes eggs and bacon, while the rest of the family had some items from the kid's menu and daily special, along with some egg benedicts omelet or something.   Like I said food was good but nothing that really blows you away so if you're looking for solid good breakfast and a nice environment with the good stuff I would definitely recommend this location  They do carry \"spiritual libations\" so make sure you order one of their Mimosas or Bloody Mary's if can do it and they served an expansion menu for lunch if you can't make up your mind.",

I chose the steak and eggs (poached) while my husband opted for the chicken and waffles. Both AMAZING. Nothing super fancy or unique but we ate every single bite.  Our server was a sweetheart who made friendly small talk and checked in with us throughout breakfast.  The chicken and waffles is more of a chicken tender meal with waffles but again it's a no hassle meal. The portions are average and that's okay too.",

We tried other places in the area but they were so-so and ok.  We definitely preferred US EGG.  Now, we are back home and been to our regular breakfast place a couple of times and realized that the huge portions are overwhelming and end up feeling heavy and slow. We may have to find another place for breakfast now and I don't mean that in a bad way.  BTW, the protein pancakes are awesome!  I'm a fan now!",

My only bug-a-boo is that some of the hostesses and waitresses wear shorts that are so short and even too small and to be honest it's a little uncomfortable. There are children around and I don't feel that it's appropriate to wears shorts that could qualify as underwear to work. It's not going to stop me from getting my protein pancakes but had to share that tid bit.",

Also love the greyhounds and mimosa's!!!",

A family owned breakfast house composed of unequaled dollops of excellent service, specialty waffles, pancakes, bacon 'n eggs, homemade soups, fresh market salads, gourmet sandwiches, juicy burgers, premium desserts.   Today I am enjoying a stand alone, thick, freshly baked, dark Belgium style waffle entree filled with Wild Maine blueberries, granola, cinnamon, slivered almonds plus high quality whey protein topped with butter and maple syrup. 8.29  What really works for me is the whey protein. My hunger is satisfied after a meal that includes whey.  Tasty coffee is served in a thermal carafe so you never have to wait for your server to come around with the pot.   The grand opening is barely 3 weeks old. The interior design looks great. I love the egg carton U.S. flag and map. Well done.  Just wanted to thank all of the Gebran Family for the exemplary experience over the years and to you today Samantha.",

Grilled chicken sandwich ($11) came with very small rubbery (microwaved?) chicken breast, minimal avocado, soggy bread and not-quite melted cheese.  Side of coleslaw was old as indicated by the lack of crunch and the purple cabbage color seeping into the dressing.  Waitress offered to make it better, but I had lost my appetite.

Myself and another guest decided to go today for brunch because I received a $10.00 off any entree coupon. We ordered our entrees,  the turkey sausage were tasteless, and my scrambled eggs were hard & dry-gross!  The waitresses stood in the kitchen door taking turns staring at me-real weird! No third eye, no scars, just dining with someone whose race did not match my own which is probably why there was such a silent 'ruckus'.  At any rate,  we were presented with the bill, at such time I handed our waitress the $10.00 off coupon. The waitress disappeared for a long time, then finally emerged & asked if we received our bill back from her manager. -What??? Did I miss something? How did our meal involve her 'manager' all of a sudden?  Hmmmmm, we then received the bill from the waitress and I noticed that the oj and coffee (2 each) were $5.98 to explain it more clearly, the 2 coffees were $5.98 and the 2 OJs were $5.98.   It was my mistake for not paying attention to their prices!  However, when I questioned the bill, the waitress was quiet-crickets!  No comment. Needless to say, for the below standard food, adjustment to bill & service, we will not return, and oh, did I mention that I in turn made no adjustment under the 'tip' section other than to line it out!  Get it boys and girlz?  lol!",

Yes I intended to over indulge and completely fall off the diet wagon. And possibly burn it for the day. My waitress was attentive, but that's about all I can say for her. When I asked about the corned beef hash and whether or not it was fresh or canned, her answer was that it was fresh. This was a pleasant surprise given that 95% of restaurants serve canned corn beef hash. So, taking a chance I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs with a stack of pancakes. When she asked me if I wanted the \"protein\" pancakes I answered no, just the basic unhealthy buttermilk pancakes please. Sadly, this restaurant only serves whole-wheat pancakes. If you're looking for tender, light, tasty pancakes, do not come here. Their whole wheat pancakes have the consistency of shipping twine, and the flavor of butchers paper. The best thing I can say about the (canned) corned beef hash is that it wasn't burned. The scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and English muffin were average. For a total of $18+ (I wasn't charged for the pancakes as I sent them back, and she didn't charge me for the milk as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\"), this was a complete disappointment. Never coming back.",

Protein Pancakes are great, but if you have a texture thing and don't like \"chunkiness\", try the whole wheat pancakes. They taste just like regular, amazing, decadent pancakes. Everyone is always so friendly and makes me feel welcome (even though I usually come in after rolling out of bed on a Sunday). Thanks for the awesome food and service!",

The hash browns were white, not cooked enough, and far from crispy.  They were gross and bland, but I ate some because I was hungry.  The English muffin was yummy.  The omlette was NOT tasty.  The ingredients weren't cooked into the egg, rather the egg was cooked, folded then the garden veggies and bacon were thrown in the middle without being cooked into the egg. I ate a bite off egg and had to gather the add-ins.  And the amount of bacon was way too much --about twice the amount of veggies!  I didnt like it and was not impressed!  I won't get another omlette from U.S. Egg.  If I come again, I'll stick with the pancakes or club sandwich.",

The last time we were there, the server offered us \"to go\" drinks, which is SO helpful in Arizona in July. The coffee is delicious (I bought a bag to bring home), and my Bloody Mary was excellent! This is the fourth time we've been here, and we've had a great experience each time. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "My husband and I arrived at around 9am on a Saturday for breakfast.  This was my first visit, and his second.  We were sat right away, and the restaurant had a very clean appearance.  I looked through the menu, and noticed the prices were higher than most breakfast places, this was before seeing their large portions.  I ordered the traditional egg breakfast: 2 eggs (over medium), bacon crispy, hash browns, and an english muffin.  My husband ordered the meat breakfast skillet.  Food came out quickly, and it looked great.  The bacon was cooked well, the eggs were cooked very over easy though.  The whites and the yolks were not cooked up to a safe level in my opinion.  I would recommend telling them to make sure that the whites are at least cooked through.  My husband's skillet was huge!!!  2 people could have split it with leftovers!  He ate about 1/3 of it before giving up.    Overall it was a nice experience.  Refills came quick, the service was great, and the prices were good, considering the large portions.  The only things keeping my from rating this restaurant a \"5\" is the eggs being undercooked.",

They have a variety of skillets to choose from for different taste buds. My personal favorite is the meat lovers skillet. The different types of meat on a bed oh hash browns, an egg, and they too it off with gravy. I always bring my guests who visit here for breakfast. Two thumbs up for their excellent customer service and wait times.",

The food is always good and the portions decent, but the prices seem high, especially for any substitutions. Avocado is almost $4 bucks and their gluten free options are very limited and not very impressive. They have GF waffles, but not pancakes, which is interesting. (and the waffles are small)   Would I come back, yes but would I choose US Egg over the Breakfast Joint in North Scottsdale or Butters in Scottsdale, Unfortunately No. Both of those places just have amazing GF pancakes and they don't overcharge for the option.",

Tried the protein pancake and it wasn't cooked all the way through - the middle was still wet. Ick. Flavor of the pancake was decent but nothing to rave about. One friend tried the egg breakfast - good but hash browns were undercooked and another the protein waffle - very good. Service is very good here and the place is clean. But are they hurrying with the food to seat the diners waiting? I don't know but I probably won't be back to find out.",

    "text": "Went with the girl's book club (ie. wine club.. hehe) for brunch today.  Good thing one of the gals had made reservations for our party of 9 because this place was SUPER busy and crowded on late Sunday morning.  This is a new place to the area, so there were a lot of expectations with the new place.  Here's what went down:  Our server was a nice, young gal that seemed overwhelmed with our group - we kept having to ask her and then ask again for things like coffee, coffee mugs, creamer, pens for the check, etc.  I was baffled by their so-called coffee mugs - I swear the damn thing could only contain 5oz of coffee!!  Everytime you sipped, you had to refill.. oh, and why would you serve a table of 9 only ONE CARAFE of coffee when they're clearly drinking through that stuff and keep asking for refills?  That boggled me!  To make it worse, we realized cups of coffee were over 2 dollars each!  Really?  This was not some kind of Organic, Fair-Trade Starbucks brew, this was US Egg.. give me a break.  I had the Scottsdale Salad (yeah, I know, what a dumb name) which was actually very tasty: perfect amount of well cooked onions, apples, and chicken over Spinach.  I did see a lot of empty plates, but didn't hear too many praises, so I'm not sure what to report on that.  Overall, the service gal was nice but not very functional at her job; the food I had was tasty, plentiful, but I can't review their 'breakfast items' at this point (I may have to come again).  The place is well decorated, new, and hoppin', so I'm saying I could give it another shot .. it was not a bad experience as a whole.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting family and decided to eat at US Egg as I had positive experiences previously. The customer service was horrible both times I visited. The first we waited a good 20 minutes before being greeted by our waitress and a hostess took our drink orders as she could see us growing uncomfortable. The waitress took our orders and checked in after the food came out...which we had quite a few pieces missing or made incorrectly. She never apologized for the inconveniences.  We decided to give it another try and the second visit was far worse. Around a 25 minute wait to be seated which was understandable since it was Sunday morning. We were seated out on the patio which was actually nice and quiet and not too hot in the summer sun! The refills on drinks were not automatic we had to flag down our waitress twice for refills on water and OJ. However we placed our orders and all of the meals came out after 40 minutes except for mine....it arrived 10-15 minutes after everyone else's after we had to remind the wait staff twice. We spoke with the manager who was very nice and apologized for the inconvenience and completely covered my late meal. The waitress also apologized and was genuinely apologetic about the error.  I will not be returning to this location simply because of the service.",
