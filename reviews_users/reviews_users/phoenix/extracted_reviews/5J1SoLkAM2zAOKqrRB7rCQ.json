They waited until I was almost done with my gyro before bringing out the to go order so that my co-worker would have a warm gyro when I got back.  The fries are kind of bland, next time I'll get the Greek salad as my side option.  I'm going to have a hard time now when I'm in this area deciding between this place and the famous cheesesteak place in the same complex.",

    "text": "When you call yourself the king of gyros you are setting a high bar for yourself before somebody even steps in the door. However this spot makes a gyro that while not locking up the title of King clearly it certainly has a solid claim to the throne.  I came here late on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend for lunch and we were both pretty hungry so we went with the combo's with greek salad's. For $16 we got 2 filled to the brim with meat gyros, 2 salads, and 2 sodas.   There isn't much to say about the salad, it's a greek salad with the usual fixings but what stood out was the peppers, cucumber and tomato all tasted fresh. Salads had a good mix of peppers, onions, cucumber and tomato so nothing dominated. Feta and dressing were standard fare.  The gyro's stood out. I got the fireman's gyro which is a standard gyro with giardiniera peppers (a nod to the heavy Chicago roots of this place). The first thing I noticed when presented with the gyro was just how much meat it had in it (having been freshly shaved to order from the spit). This thing was loaded with meat. The next thing was that the tzatziki was a thicker heavier version than the more smooth salad dressing kind most places, this was more of a spread or dip. It had great dill flavor and really complimented the meat. When taking a bite of this the flavors of the juicy meat with the spicy giardiniera and refreshing cooling flavors of the tzatziki was just perfect.  The place was clean and the staff friendly and personable. I also liked being able to see into the prep area with the spinning spits of chicken and gyro meat, it made my mouth water from the moment I walked in seeing the delicious and juicy meats. Watching them shave the gyro meat to order was a great way to showcase the freshness.  The bottom line was the gyro was very tasty and filling with a ton of meat for a great price. Both my girlfriend and I were so fully we ended up only needing a light dinner late. There are some other good gyro places that may be a bit more authentic to the middle eastern style but the King of Gyros is easily in contention for the Iron Throne of Gyros.",

I asked for no tomato and received: no tomato, no onion and a dab of tzatziki.   The side greek salad was okay, so long as you didn't want much more than lettuce.

I tried their Chicken Shawarma and Steak Shawarma in their combo plate. It was served with rice and on top of that you get a Greek salad on the side. Let's just start by saving the meat was bursting of flavor and their portions were huge, I had enough for a second meal.   They've got a loyal customer in me. I've never been disappointed with their service. To-go orders are always packed nicely and ready to go!",

I live and work very close to this establishment and could eat it daily (yes, I have a problem).  Just like any other good restaurant, it gets quite busy around lunch time, and for food reason.  Great tasting, healthy Mediterranean food done right!  Check them out, you will enjoy it, I promise!",

If you're really hungry, you can also get their traditional gyro along with a side (crinkle fries, salad, or soup) and a drink for about $8. They even have Code Red if you're a fan of that!  The location is a bit small, but very clean. You can also get 10% off with the Yelp check-in deal. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a good gyro.",

All the meats were dry and appeared overcooked. Given the prices, I was hoping for something that was deliciously flavored and cooked to perfection. Sadly both weren't present at our particular meal. Their fries that came along with the meal were also undercooked and not really flavorful. The Kefta plate which I had was the biggest offender as they were well overcooked and devoid of moisture...I was really depressed with that meal. The only saving grace was their pita was fresh and the highlight to that night.  I guess I will have to continue my search for a great Gyro place...",

Pita: hard and tasteless  Gyro meat: meh  Chicken Schwarma: dry as hell  Hummus: tasteless!  Everything was fairly dry. We asked for more sauces and they basically wanted another dollar for more sauce.  If people need sauce for your food to make it edible, give it to them. Especially when they just paid you $26 for a Gyro and a Combo plate.  Screw this place. Lots better all around it.

While I don't frequent King of Gyros on a weekly basis, every time I go it seems as if everyone else goes on a daily basis! One time I was in, the lady at the register (I'm assuming maybe owner?) acknowledged the three people that came after either by name or by their repeat order. I was super impressed. There's also an older gentleman that works there, who is always so kind and welcoming every time I come in. This place is great!",

It has a hip, city feel to it unlike other gyro places that are in need of an update. I feel like I'm back in Cali or Seattle. Prices are pretty on point so not much to say there. The staff is very friendly and easy going.  So the food... The gyro is really wonderful!! The tzatziki sauce is fantastic. Layered under the shaved meat is onions and sliced tomato. Really delicious. However, my only criticism are the fries. They're very much an after thought. No seasoning, thick starchy pieces of potato. So 4 stars. Next time I'll just have the sandwich alone or try one of their salads. Other than the fries this was an excellent experience. I'd definitely be back. Oooh and they have styrofoam cups! Back to 5 stars! I'm aware they suck for the environment but name another material that keeps your drink cold for literally hours in our Arizona heat. ...Yeah exactly.",

    "text": "Long overdue update: King of Gyros (KOG) is as good as it gets IMHO for fast casual Greek food; when out and about KOG is always my pick for tasty, healthy choices served up by friendly folks who treat customers like royalty! Even when I dropped my lunch in the car park yesterday, I knew it would be delicious as always, and it survived pretty much intact because they pack it well (I'm quite sure they would have replaced it, but my legendary clumsiness is no need to waste food:)   Favorite menu items: chicken Souvlaki platter - a generous portion of marinated, grilled poultry - with their smooth and tangy hummus, and refreshing Greek Salad; the falafel which is never greasy sporting a pillowy, well seasoned interior; the dolmades adorned with quality olive oil and a bright lemon splash which brings those delicate grape leaves to life; and finally the lentil soup which I eat whenever I can, the spices add a warmth and depth I crave; their hot, fluffy pita is a perfect accompaniment. Scott thoroughly enjoys the gyros which are carved to order from a proper spit and is a fan of both the rice and fries, the aforementioned Greek salad and dolmades: he worked for years in a Greek diner in NY and is therefore picky about this cuisine, and loves it.   KOG is family owned and operated, service is always with a smile, so welcoming. The kitchen is open, so you can watch your food being prepared, the dining area is clean, they offer beer, wine, soft drinks (bottles and fountain) and unsweetened fresh brewed iced tea which I love. At lunchtime they are very busy with local workers chowing down on reasonably priced and quick, delicious eats; ordering in advance can save some time.   Wish: Avgolemono soup (I have been lobbying for them to make it for a year, but can't resist their bomb lentil soup!)   Long live the King!!!  * 10% off first Yelp check-in  * tasty baklava  * closed Sunday  * order ahead online - you can use Yelp! app - or via phone @ lunch if you are in a hurry  * reasonably priced for quality ingredients",

    "text": "I have dined here three times.  The high reviews brought me here and brought me back again to ensure I didn't miss something.  I guess Greek Fast Casual (GFC) is the current trend based on the number of higher rated reviews on Yelp across The Valley.    I have taken the time to eat at four other highly rated GFC restaurants in the East Valley and I have found a common denominator: Kronos Meats.  Kronos is a 40-year-old company that produces Gyros meat and other products like Tzatziki Sauce and Hummus.  That said, there is a benefit in using premade meat: consistency.  The taste of each product served at most GFCs is very similar because of the use of Kronos products; if it doesn't taste good it can usually be attributed to overcooking the meat, or over-heating the pre-sliced meat.  Therefore, if you have an amazing Gyro or Kabob pita, it is probably because of proper preparation and handling; often, it is because of cutting corners such as using pre-sliced meat or pre-slicing the meat and keeping it in the warmer.  Not that is what I saw here at the King of Gyros, but I digress.    The Beef and Beef/Lamb Options were tasty and moist; the best of which I experienced was the pork.  The portions are above average at King of Gyros compared to other GFCs, this includes being a bit heavy handed on the Feta Cheese used on multiple products as well as the \"Dressing\" on the Greek Fries.  Greek Fries are relatively straightforward: garlic, Feta, seasoning (olive oil, etc.) and salt atop French-fried potatoes, it is not too hard to get right, and when each component is in the proper proportion to the others, Greek Fries are amazing!  Unfortunately, The King does not get this right, the fries are swimming in what is best described as salad dressing, it is just not palatable (see posted photos).  The salads offered are also generous on the portions, however, they seem to suffer from the same overdressing as the fries.  Which is a shame because the product quality seems on the high side but it just cannot stand up to the barrage of oil & vinegar.  Another issue I, and my dining partners, experienced is some inconsistencies of the cook of meat.  On one visit, the Chicken Shawarma was moist and tender on a salad, yet dry and chewy on a pita, really? How did they do that?  I do appreciate the relatively quick service, even when it is busy.  I like that there is a drink tower and real brewed iced tea is offered; Pepsi fans will also be happy with the fountain selections.  On my first visit, the pictorial menu board proved tricky because of the close spacing between products and the placement of the description and price below the photo and the menu number above caused me to order a number seven when I thought I was ordering what was really a number four.  This happened again to a dining companion on another visit.  Perhaps a reprogramming is in order because the cashier admitted it happens often; not the worst thing, but a menu should be clear and concise as well as illustrative.  Overall, The King of Gyros is a solid 3.5 stars.  The food is good, the service is sufficient the prices are on par with the competition, but there is nothing that I experienced or ate that was memorable or would make me become a regular.  If you are in the area and you have a taste for Greek, The King of Gyros will fit the bill, but I have found other places that are worth the drive and are tastier.  Overall rating: 3.5 Quality: 3.6 Service: 3.6 Cleanliness: 3.4 Value: 3.2 Atmosphere: 3",

There are quite a few meats and a few vegetarian options for both plates and pita sandwiches, with a combo option that includes a drink and soda or salad. I went with the #7 chicken shawarma pita combo with fries. It came out in a few minutes, filled to the brim with marinated chicken breast, onion, mixed greens, tomato, and a hearty layer of tzatziki sauce. The chicken was tender and the vegetables fresh with a soft, warm, fluffy textured pita. It was so big it wouldn't really fit in the \"Gyro\" paper sandwich holder that came with it.  The fries were crinkle cut and were cooked well. There is a soda fountain with Pepsi products, Dr. Pepper, diet Dr. Pepper, and various iced teas to the side.   The interior is spacious with high ceilings and a dark grey/black theme. The tables are nice with granite countertops.  The total for the pita combo was a little less than $10.  Service at the counter was decent, not super friendly but hey what do you expect from a fast food place.  I'll be back for more delicious pitas and plates!",

The employees seemed nice and there were TVs in the place to entertain us. But, overall, we were disappointed. Based on what the reviews said we expected much tastier food.",

The quality of the meat, sauces, seasonings, are truly top notch and you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Wide variety of menu and the interior is nicely decorated with a Chicago style theme, even better since that's my home town!  Next time I'm in Arizona, the first stop I'm making is kings gyros!",

I ordered the falafel pita combo & chose a Greek salad instead of fries. My older daughters ordered the kids hot dog & chicken strips.   When the food was finished the servings were quite large. Full size hot dog & 3 large piping hot chicken strips for the kids. Both came with a reasonable serving of crinkle cut fries. The Greek salad was large enough to make a light meal out of by itself. Lots of dark green lettuces, cucumber slices, & too few tomatoes. Topped with Feta crumbles & a bit too much dressing (definitely ordering light on the dressing or on the side next time) and a single un-pitted black olive (it deserved friends). The falafel was stuffed with some unexpected ingredients including herbed & roasted broccoli, sugar snap peas, & onions. I prefer green falafel to the fresh fried red variety they serve with a distinctly Indian flavor but it was very well made. I most missed Tahini sauce which I usually order extra but doesn't appear on their version of falafel at all probably because it wouldn't complement the veggies as well.   Overall we all will return to try more of their bargain priced menu.",

Turned to my trusty Yelp! app and found King of Gyros. Not certain how this place doesn't have 5-stars (What's up Yelpers in Phoenix?), but decided to give it a shot.  The line was short, the service was fantastic, and the salad... Heavenly! Best part... No Romaine lettuce so no salmonella poisoning for me!!   Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes Return? Yes Advocate? Yes",

But if you only have a half hour lunch or are in a rush I highly recommend calling in your order and take it to go. Every table was taken and as soon as anyone got up the table was quickly occupied. It is a really small place so if you don't like being in a crowded place don't eat here at lunch during the week. Now, the food was delicious! I added feta to my pita wrap and I felt there should have been more but still very good. The sauce was delicious and i wish there was more of that too but still tasted great! The chicken was marinated and tender. Pita was soft and delicious! I will definitely be back.",

The salad was delicious but I would suggest to order extra sauce with it.  The kabobs were tender and flavorful.  The poppers were hot and fresh from the fryer.  (Frozen premade  poppers).  The fries and crinkle cut and crispy.  The Gyro sandwich was good as it comes with lots of meat.  I would suggest to ask for extra sauce as well.  Plus the tomato is put on the pita first so the hot meat will make it soft and mushy.  I didn't mind but you may have a different preference.",

Unfortunately the chicken shawarma looked a lot tastier than it actually was as it was fairly tough. I would recommend not asking for a salad as your side dish since all of the plates come with a salad already. The gyro meat itself was pretty good and they definitely give you a large portion of food here for how much it costs!   This is an above average Mediterranean place but still falls short to the likes of hajji baba in Tempe! I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again though.",

He yelled at my husband for holding the door open for me! Grandpa must have been worried about the A/C bill. I guess there's no place for chivalry at King of Gyros.

I had the basic gyro combo meal with fries and a drink (side salad is available instead of fries for the same price). The fries and soda are just about the same as you can find anywhere but not bad. The gyro stands out because it comes on a nice thick piece of pita bread and is loaded with meat. The sauce really makes it with a decent garlic punch to the face. They don't overload the gyro with sauce and veggies. For under $10 you'll be stuffed. The restaurant is pretty clean even after the lunch rush. The only thing that I struggled with was the cheap napkins. You can have all the napkins you need but they don't work that well. Don't let a bad napkin stop you from enjoying a great lunch though. I'll be back to try more menu items.",

    "text": "The King of Gyros has some backing to the name. The food was fresh and delicious. You order your food at the register (the menu above the register feels like it's up in the sky by the way; it's way up there!) and then sit down in the fairly spacious dining area. The workers were polite and looked like they enjoyed helping you. A big plus!   We ordered the gyro wrap with fries and a salad. The gyro meat was flavorful and well cooked. The cool, fresh veggies were nestled in the pita, and it was all topped with perhaps the best gyro sauce I've had. It was a little darker than typical \"Tzatziki\" sauce, so I won't call it that just in case it is something different.   I have to knock off 2 stars though (I stopped myself from giving them a 2 star rating), and here is why. While we were eating, an employee was mopping the dining room and the smell was overwhelming. It literally felt like we were eating in the restroom. It was a \"good\" smell if you like cleaners, but it's not something you want while trying to enjoy your food. I would HIGHLY recommend the restaurant to mop during after-hours. The place wasn't that dirty to be mopping while people are eating anyway. And I didn't feel the restaurant was that much cleaner after mopping. All it did was ruin our food experience.   But the food is great from what I could taste in the midst of the mopping bucket aroma. Next time, I may try some take-out, or eat outside.",

Smart and comfortable layout, holds a lot of people, really cool memorabilia on the walls, lots of natural light and one entire wall is the Chicago skyline, really well done! It's comfortable and easy to navigate self-ordering, drinks and eating here. Be warned, it's so good that it can get really crowded, I hope you don't mind sharing a table with a friendly stranger or two, because it can get busy and there's good reason for it.  Service: Aamir and his wife, the owners, are extremely friendly, social, talkative and genuinely care about your satisfaction, to a fault. Other employees are nice, but you'll definitely know when you're talking with Aamir, he is immediately like a family member that you love to hang out with, always has a smile, a story and is genuinely appreciative of your patronage.  Food: The food is always fresh and tasty, relatively good portions and authentic. Aamir is extremely proud of his lentil soup and he should be, it's phenomenal! Everything we've eaten here has been excellent. They offer a spicy Shawarma that I've never had before and it's excellent. Value is decent, it's not inexpensive, not crazy expensive, worth it.  Do I recommend King of Gyros? Absolutely! It is our new, \"go to\" Mediterranean restaurant. Always feels comfortable with reliable service and great quality food. Try it, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Not too many places in the valley make a rotisserie gyro but the King of Gyros would definitely fall in my top 10 spots for a good quantity of sandwich.  This time around we ordered the gyro sandwichs and made a meal with french fries and a soft drink. Also got a Greek salad and chicken pita sandwich.  The wait wasn't so long but they had a steady flow of people coming in an out (not too busy for a weeknight). When the food arrived I was happy with the large portion sandwich. The pieces of gyro were stacked almost to the point where you couldn't fold them over without the pita bread breaking in half. Definitely needed a fork as you were going to have some toppings fall out (and that's a good thing)  The salad was decent but a little too much dressing. Part of it was the presentation as it is served on a paper plate. Plenty of salad, but need to find something else vs a paper plate. The only thing keeping this place from a higher rating was the fries. This time around I was disappointed as the fries were overcooked & came out lukewarm. Not sure if they were cooked earlier and then recooked, but wasn't a fan this time around.   Fountain drink selection is Pepsi & they only had a few choices along with a variety of teas (unsweetened and one Lipton Brisk).  I was looking for some strong carbonation to help close the deal but the Pepsi soda just didn't provide it for me this time around (kinda flat, or maybe that's just Pepsi vs other colas).  Looking forward to my next trip and hope the fries are on point like the sandwich!",

    "text": "We were in the neighborhood after an Ikea trip and were running down the list of nearby places to eat. Greek food sounded good but I'm always apprehensive about any business who crowns themselves with a self-proclaimed title like \"king of ...\", I think it's up to me to decide if they earn such a title, not the business owner.  Ok, let's cut right to it, this modest strip mall place is all that and maybe even more.  They've got the look of a business who's serious about food - no minimum wage entry level hash slingers in sight, but rather several guys who look like they know what Greek food is supposed to taste like.  Our only contact was with the cashier (the guys were working their tails off in the kitchen) and she was friendly and efficient.  The depth of the menu is impressive, more choices than expected.  Serving sizes for the price were also impressive.  But where they really shine is flavor. If you like your meat to be tender but with a smoky crispy charbroil to it, you will love this place.  There are a lot of similar restaurants in \"the Valley\" and I've been to a lot of them, and so far King of Gyros is one of the best.  We took our order to go so I could only take a quick glance at the dining room, but it looks casual and friendly and a good place to hang out with friends.  There's only one thing that I would suggest they consider - if you order a dinner plate it includes a fountain drink whether you want one or not, there's no credit if you don't want the drink.  That doesn't always work out so well for people who order their meal to go, which seems to be a fairly high percentage of their customers.  I'm not complaining a lot because none on the dinner meals were very expensive to start with and the cashier kindly offered to let us take a bottle water from the cooler in lieu of a fountain drink, and a bottle of water in the desert always comes in handy.  I like this place and will definitely be back.",

It also includes soft, piping hot triangles of pita bread.  The salad was a large portion with a delicious, bright, lemony dressing that I couldn't get enough of.  Their special tzatziki sauce was full of herb flavors and complimented the chicken perfectly.  The entire space was spotless.  The floors looked like they had just been mopped.  Everyone there was so nice and friendly.  I think they can safely call themselves the King of Gyros.  The title is very fitting.",

Many co-workers would rave about this place so of course I had to give it a shot (and they offer a 10% discount if you have a badge from that Company).  The Gyros, Shawarma and Chicago Dog are awesome. As are the greek fries and regular french fries. The crinkle fries are always hot, fresh and crispy. I can never resist the boxes of pistachio baklava sitting next to the cash register either.   This is a very affordable establishment to grab a quick bite. And fairly healthy! I love these family owned places.",

I'm not a huge salad person so I went with the gyro platter which ended up being perfect! Came with shreds of beef, a few onions and tomatoes, pita bread, rice hummus or fries, and then a side of soup or salad. Oh and a drink too! I went with rice and then a side of fries instead of the lentil soup or salad. Portion sizes were ginormous!! There was enough for me to bring home for dinner!! Food was delicious, came out quickly, and really hit the spot. Only complaint is that the rice had a slightly strange aftertaste that I wasn't too fond of, but I quickly got over that when I mixed it with the tzatziki sauce.",

I've had many a gyro pita sandwich in my life and for me, this was just average, and maybe even a little bit on the salty side and very stingy on the tzatziki.  On the plus side, the staff is friendly and helpful, and some of their other entrees looked appetizing.  Next time I am in the area, I might try the chicken shawarma.",

    "text": "AZ is known for having some of the best middle eastern  food so when I saw this place right now next to my work I was excited to try it! I called in my order as soon as they opened at 10am and the guy who took my order was rude, didn't tell me how long it would take or anything. Once I got there the same guy who took my order came up rudely told me my total while being on his iPhone on a call. He continued to be on a phone call while I paid him and got my food and my drink and came back to work only to find a bad smell coming either the chicken or yellow rice, I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with rice and it had the kind of smell of food just beginning to go bad. I figured it was probably a smell of some spices they might've used so I started eating it. Conclusion: the chicken was under cooked and didn't taste anything like your typical chicken shawarma mixed in with some broccoli and green beans which is odd bc I don't think any Mediterranean place sells their chicken shawarma sauteed with broccoli, it tasted really bad. The rice was dripping with oil and gave me really bad heartburn. Needless to say I had to get pepto-b because I got sick from it. Ive been to places like haji baba princess and never tasted such weird Mediterranean food that was this bad, NOT SURE HOW THIS PLACE HAS 5 STARS The only thing nice about this restaurant is their huge painting.... Sadly I won't be going there for lunch every again!",

(It was less than 10 mins). Very thoughtful gesture. If you are looking for excellent food provided by friendly faces, look no further.",

The prices are more than fair considering you get a ton of food for what you pay. Everything is super clean and never dirty or messy. All of the employees are always helpful and gracious. The owner and his family are truly amazing and are willing to accommodate your order.  I love this place as does my entire family. We usually go at least twice a week; sometimes more. I highly recommend it! I only gave it 5 stars because that's the most it will allow or I'd give it a 10.",

Had the falafel platter, and friend had the gyro platter, which was apparently very good (and I noticed had a ton of meat). I loved the falafel! At some restaurants, the falafel is so dry, but here they were moist and had really great flavor. SO nice to go somewhere where they are not treated like an afterthought! The side salads that come with the platters were mediocre - they were really fresh but the dressing was boring. But everything else was delicious! The platters are big enough for two meals; I had lunch the next day too.  Overall a great place, great value, excellent food! Will definitely be back.",

I am used to the bountiful Chicken sammie @ Greek Wraps-just spoiled I guess.  The fries were plentiful-just needed to be crispier.  They add a yummy sauce for your meal-a nice touch.",

A lot of the meats seem to be cooked ahead of time and then reheated but I guess that is what you have to do in order to get it out fast. Their pita bread is always soft and warm and tastes like it was fresh baked in house. Unfortunately I am in the middle of a gluten free experiment so I can't partake in any of that right now. But I am happy that almost any meat on the menu can be ordered in salad form. I am pretty picky about salad dressings but I love the house Greek dressing. So lemony! Yum! The salad base is romaine lettuce but they also include a bunch of other fresh veggies like bell pepper, onion, tomato, cucumber as well as feta and kalamata olives.  Most of the people working there are college age kids but they all are really courteous. We have always gotten great service. Last night we were there right as they were closing (8pm) but they still went out of their way to make sure we got everything we needed for our take out order. They also have sort of a Chicago theme going on so we got to catch part of the Bears preseason game while we waited.",

Food tasted great. I really enjoyed the hummus and tabouleh. The falafel was also good, and the dolmas came in last for my personal preference. I've just never been a big fan of them. The tzaziki sauce was tasty and went well with everything. Husband really enjoyed his beef dish and we both made sure to thank the staff for quickly fixing the original issue and giving such a nice flavorful meal. Overall I'd go back again!",
