Great sporty ambience with a decent selection of beers to have alongside wings.",

We came in a got seated right away. The service was pretty average, our waiter made sure we had our drinks full at all times.   I can't say I was pleased with the drinks or food they served. I ordered an ice tea of some sort and I could practically crunch the sugar in my teeth! The wings were almost cold when they brought them out and tasted like they hardly had any meat left on them!   Pretty disappointed at this location from all the times we have gone to BWW we have never been so grossed out by the food. Next time we want wings we definitely won't come to this one.",

We had been there so long that it must've been time for his break. Since he was no where to be found, we asked for a manger. The manager Jeff came out, and said he would inquir about our food. Not what I wanted as I knew at that point the food was coming out. And of course he didn't make the food come out any sooner, we still had to wait for it to come out. When the manager brought the food out, he gave us 2 tickets for free wings. When I voiced my dissatisment with this option, he offered another 2 free tickets. I accepted, however, he came back out twice after that, and we tried to get his attention, but he was actively ignoring us and avoiding eye contact. My boyfriend insisted we leave because he was tired of waiting around. This was hands down the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant, and that's saying something.",

However management has made us uncomfortable a couple of times by they way they address the staff for customers to hear and to witness; hence the four star rating. One time the GM called our bartender a liar and was right behind us when he said it. The bartender while too professional to say anything to his customers was clearly upset. I was embarrassed for him.  This isn't the only management person to do this here but it is uncomfortable for the customer. If they need to address employee behavior it should be done away from the customers. Very unprofessional behavior.",

Needless to say, after 15 minutes of being seated I had to go in and ask the bartender for a server. 5 minutes later, our server arrived. He took our drink order and brought that back 5 minutes later. He left and said he would be right back for our order. Another 15 minutes goes by, still no server. I had to go in and ask for him AGAIN. He was sent back to our table and took our order. We only ordered three things. Our food was brought to the table by another person and was wrong. Go figure. By this time my already lukewarm Pepsi with the generously given 3 ice cubes has gone to hot..... the server returns and we ask for our bill and boxes, we have had enough by this point. 10 minutes later we get a few boxes, after we asked for them AGAIN by another server passing through our area. Our server brought the check and I gave him my card to pay for the bill after it was corrected for his mistake. Another 10 minutes..... he brings the corrected bill and FORGETS HE HAS TAKEN MY CREDIT CARD ENTIRELY. He then states he needs to go inside and find my card. He comes back, corrected bill and my card. I sign. We leave. AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH. NO MANAGER EVER CAME. If this is the level of service that is satisfactory here then we will will no longer bother coming.",

    "text": "I don't normally do this, but I finally stopped being sick after eating here last night.   I'd like to preface this by saying this is not a service review. The service was not the problem, although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars, I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead. $5 would have been reasonable.  The real problem what what I ate. We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine. As a Canadian, when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it. It was a long way from the delicious, savory poutine from my homeland. For those of you who have never eaten poutine, it would fit right in with southern style cooking. Take french fries, add creamy cheese curds (or if you're not sure where to buy those, chopped up braided mozzarella works well too), top with fresh, steamy brown gravy. The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.  This was not what I experienced. First of all, the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried (another special appetizer they had). Instead of the poutine effect of creamy, melty, cheesy goodness, it was more like soggy clumps. I made due, it's been a while since I've had poutine. I asked for no pico de gailo, because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine. I didn't get any as part of the order, so once again, i praise the server for taking a proper order. There was enough gravy, but there was just something...off about it. It was very subtle, but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette, but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals.   The abdominal pain started at 2 am, about 4 hours after consuming the meal. I'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting...usually. I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed. Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room, I will say that finally, at 12 pm today, I stopped feeling sick.  Now I don't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy (leaning towards the gravy), but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen. If you're going to be serving food to people, what's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management. You need to have standards. Taste your food. Keep it consistent.   This is the only location that I've ever had such an experience. I hope this criticism serves as constructive, to prevent others from getting sick from the food. Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients!",

It's truly a great environment and one of a kind.   I have spent quite a bit of time (and money) at this particular bdubs, if you will. Lately, my experiences haven't been the best and I feel that it needs to be put onto paper.   Fairly recently, I have noticed that the employees seem to be of a much lower morale. They don't seem to be the typical upbeat bartenders and servers that they usually are. One visit in particular showed me why this is, it's the management. I saw a manager openly yell at an employee and embarrass them in front of customers. This is so wrong and unprofessional on so many levels. These waiters / waitresses and bartenders are the SOLE reason I continue to come here. I can get a blue moon and some crappy wings anywhere... But the people are what make this place such a great environment! To see the managerial staff treat these folks this way, is unacceptable.   I will continue to come here but I will not support the managers of this establishment. It's unprofessional and deeply bothers me that they treat such wonderful, upbeat and energetic employees the way they do.   Please keep your eyes out for this, I do not want to have a reason to stop coming to this restaurant but if that's what it takes, I will.",

Wish i could upload pictures of my anorexic wings.I would be embarrassed to serve these to my friends at home let a lone a business. Can they play the music any louder? I guess talking to your friends isn't allowed and I could hardly hear the waiter. I had $45 in gift cards and when i walked out I gave them away guy living on the street. I don't have a use for them anymore. Do yourself a favor and head across the parking lot to Canes!",

She treated me awesome however the last two times I came in I received horrible customer service and issues with my food. This last time I eas thr only one at the bar it was 4 hours before close and still the bsrtender paid no attention to me . he tried to hurry my drink choice when I was asking about what beers they had on tap. Then once i got my beer he disapeered into the kitchen and didnt come back to take my food order for 20 minutes . then took my order snd disapeered again. My food came out quick but it was supposed to be 6 bone out and 6 bone in wings except I was missing two bone in wings.  And the bartender never came to check on me if it was okay . so I never got the problem with the wings corrected.  so I just ate my wings and left. Also 17 dollars for a combo of only 12 wings and some chips is a horrible deal. Do not get the combo they try to upsell. Total rip off. And horrible service. If there is only one person at your bar and your not busy you should not just be in the kitchen ignoring your bar. I even saw bar tickets pile up and he was no where to be found .",

It's hard to critic service when the place is so packed, you have to expect some drop in service but our service didn't drop into unacceptable territory. Our server was friendly and though was delayed at times did a pretty good job of attending to us. The food came out at the expected time and was prepared well. Everyone enjoyed their meal, what you see is what you get. Overall I was impressed with our experience and how the crowds were managed, definitely would return here to watch a big sporting event without fear of being miserable. I'll update after a more normal visit.",

The hostess' were standing right at the booth and didn't say a word to us and the one of the girls just walked away. Anyways, we get seated and I ordered boneless wings and the server asked if I wanted celery or carrots and I said celery (cause it comes with those right?) and I also asked for extra ranch because they normally only bring 1. So we wait for about 30 minutes for our food and when it finally comes, we  eat and everything's great and then we get the check and our celery and every side of ranch(4 total) was .60 cents each?! our server was totally great don't get me wrong, but that's a really cheap execution on BWW's pricing. Finally when we leave, some girls dismiss us but not even a glance was shared between the both of us! She kept her eyes down the whole time and seemed like she couldn't care less. 2nd time here and won't be coming back again.",

    "text": "I went back here last night because I got home late and couldn't think of another place that would be open. Well, this experience was much less impressive than last time. We had a clueless waitress. She was extremely slow. We got drinks, which were fine, but extremely overpriced (the BF got a beer and it was 6$?!?! more than my cocktail! WTF). We also got water to go with our wings. So we got our wings, which were fine, but then the waitress disappeared. Our waters remained empty for a looong time. We also waited about 25 minutes to get our check. It was ridiculous. So when we finally got the bill, I noticed we were charged about 3$ for carrots and celery. Really??? I thought when she asked if we wanted some with the wings, it was a standard thing. I've been going to Buffalo wild wings for 6 years and have never been charged for carrots and celery. In addition, we got like 5 scrawny carrots.... we didn't even eat it all, we just figured we'd get some with the wings cuz why not? Well, we found out why not. So we pay, and on the way out, we found out what was keeping our waitress so busy while we sat there waiting for ridiculous periods of time- She was sitting at the front of the restaurant with about 5 other employees talking. Seriously?!?! That is ridiculous. I am all for enjoying work and even chatting a bit, but they should at least have a view of the dining room in order to attempt to give decent service. I really don't want to continue giving my business to this company after that experience.",

Service: Me and my group was treated so bad, Our waitress was a racist, since I observed  with my own eyes how she treated us differently compared to people who sat right across our table.  During the whole dining experience, We experience lacks of service. Our friends who came in later than us needed to wait 20 minutes to get his orders taken. When our food came, which is almost 30 minutes later, there are a lot of mistakes in flavor of what we ordered. The whole dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings is a disaster. We waited an hour for a crappy food, a lot of mistakes in our order.  Moreover at the end of the dining,  she, the waitress, charged me twice for my drinks because according to her I drank too much of Iced Tea, which supposed to be free refill.  Food: I would gave them a below average, since 2 of 12 wings which I ate that day is slightly under cooks. Some of the fries which we consumed are slightly under cooks too.  Overall: I highly won't recommend this buffalo wild wings branch to anyone!! Terrible Service!!!",

Well, the place was really clean and although it was pretty packed, we were seated immediately in the dining area. Our server asked if everyone had been there before and I chimed in so he gave me the run down with all the sauces and wings and stuff. We get our drinks and place our orders. I got 12 traditional wings with hot bbq and honey bbq sauces and some fries. My friends got wings + fries and the buffalo chicken wrap. Our server mentioned that 4 cooks didn't come in today so that there would be a bit of a wait. So about 15 minutes later...our food arrives. So riddle me this BWW...Why are there no plates? I can imagine they're conserving quite a bit of water, but if you bring out 6 containers for my meal alone, that just seems like a huge waste of cardboard. That really bothered me the whole time I was there. Anyways, the food was pretty good. I feel like I could get better wings at a number of different places. If I was big into sports though, this would be a great place to hang out during happy hour or something.",

It truly became my version of Cheers, as everyone in the restaurant knew me on a first name basis, always knew what I was ordering, and knew what booth to seat me in before I even walked in the door. Absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, work took my family and I away from the area for a few years. While my family and I managed to find other Buffalo Wild Wings where we briefly lived, it never was quite like the one in Mesa, which felt like our home away from home. Sadly when we moved back here, we found out our Buffalo Wild Wings had closed and gone out of business.  We tried out the others and they too were good but again, that Cheers feel was missing. Then, almost on accident, we found the Tempe Buffalo Wild Wings and it had the same exact feel the Mesa one had. As soon as I walked in the door for the first time, we were greeted by a manager who wanted to know our name and began a \"get to know you\" conversation that seemed more than just contrived \"pay me and get out\" banter. The other workers as I've returned have been the same, and now they know us on the same personal level the Alma School workers did. The convenient location atop of the quality service I receive everytime I walk in the door make this my restaurant of choice. Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Buffalo wild wings to me is like RA. Great atmosphere and service, but crappy food. I ordered twelve hot wings and a beer. We'll get to the beer in a minute. The wings were super greasy, like soaked in cooking oil. They were more sweet than hot, they tasted like they were dipped in sugar. The ranch was mayo with seasoning, and even had the same consistency as such. It was overall gross. I asked the difference in cost between a bud lite and a kiltlifter. The guy said, bud is $3 four a tall, and $4 for a kilt, as I began to order a kilt he verbally changed the price to $5.50. I will not return.",

Buffalo Wild Wings or as my grandkids call it \"B-Dubs\" is a perfect combo of what matters most to me (again don't tell my family). I went in there with some old college buds to watch some football and get some beers and I was impressed. It was football sunday so it was busy as expected but the service was great and the food and beer was what I needed after a hard week or work (just kidding i'm retired) but still great place!",

'nuff said.  i throughly enjoy the habenaro mango bone in wings. it's something i crave day in and day out. the beer on tap is always ice cold. and tho the servers aren't the most personable people - they get the job done in a timely manner that i can't complain.   i'll prolly be back to sweat from the heat of the wings and cool it off with a beer sooner than later!",

I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break.",

The celery was missing from my order, an oversight on my part as well since we went over the order together.   My only problem was the packaging, what a huge waste!

Also,  traditional wings are more restrictive and more expensive than boneless, which in my experience is backwards.  It is also insanely loud in the place.  On top of it they charge almost $5 for the weakest, wilted little side salad.  Also, they bring 10 wings in a small order, plus carrots and celery, with an Itty bitty 2 oz. Of ranch.  Then they want $0.60 for each 2 oz. Thereafter.  They can keep it!  $38 for two for wings and mediocre fries.  $45 after tip.  Ugh...",

Secondly my wings were dry so I asked the waiter for extra buffalo sauce but took me forever to catch his attention he kept walking fast by our table with his head down . He was soo worried about sweeping then attending to our needs . Which is annoying how was I going to eat my wings without any utensils or without a drink . Finally after I got everything I needed from the waiter , I use my knife and fork to cut the boneless wing In half but it was soo hard I couldn't even pierce through it with my knife or fork . They were completely burned Crispy and dry with no buffalo sauce . I ate like 2 Becuz obviously I was hungry that is the reason why I went to eat there and I just couldn't anymore so I asked to speak with the manager . And when she go there she obviously agreed with me that they were visibly dry and burned. She apologized and said she will remake them but I refused I just wanted the check and to leave already . This happened 5/10/19 around 10pm .. someone definitely needs to do something about this because this is unacceptable. I left hungry because I didn't eat the meal I ordered and I also had to pay for it . She gave us a voucher for a snack size of wings even tho I order a small . One thing for sure I will never come to this location again and I hope management does something about this .",

Food is often hit and miss here, unless you get boneless wings, but on this night the Buffalitos were solid, teeming with white chunks of chicken and other taco condiments. Also enjoyed the  chips and salsa on the side. This is a college area BWW, but it wasn't overly packed liked the Mill Avenue bars (Lodge) on a Saturday night around 8pm.",

The female servers will attentively take the orders of family and male tables. It's clear that they don't care about the brown population let alone the women one! Very frustrating.  I am being generous with 2 stars because I have never had a problem with the food. But if I have to wait 25min for you to take my order! We have a problem!!!!!   Literally saw my server twice and had to find a manager to charge my card.   This is too much. Hire more servers, give them water so their breath doesn't smell, clean your tables. That's all :)",

This was the fastest and best service I have ever had. Johnny was our waiter and was supported by another server. However, Johnny did a phenomenal job. He set a very high standard for the rest of his peers and others in the business. My family and I were taken back by how professional and fast Johnny and the crew at BWW were on this night. They even put on a L.A. Kings game during March Madness. Once again just wanted to express my appreciation for Johnny, the BWW team, and management who have Johnny on their team. They are doing something right with having Johnny and others working for them with a similar work ethic.   Thanks",

My waitress was really friendly and consistently checked on me to see if I needed anything. However, there was another gentlemen by the name of Roy behind the bar who was also assisting people with their orders. As he was cleaning up the area, he would crumble up napkins and shoot them in the garbage pail right in front of me where I was eating. Well one of them manage to hit my food, I notice, he notice, he just snagged it quickly, went on bartending and didn't say anything! Absolutely unacceptable behavior behind the bar! Once, I was finished I paid for my meal, drinks and mentioned the scenario to my waitress. She apologized for his behavior, mentioned it to Roy and he finally apologized as I left. Overall, the food was great, beer was tasty and definitely wont be coming back to this location.",

The staff additionally had no way for us to move Hiro to the other side, recommending that we jump over the fence and jump back over.  The lack of shade in the Arizona weather was unfit for leaving the dog outside.  Before we were served our waters, we decided to take our business elsewhere.

The meal was around $20 and I tipped to make it $24. The next week I was looking at my bank statement and the server had added to the 20% tip I gave and made it more than the food itself.

Though we (group of 7) managed to get a seat inside during the hot summer day - the service wasn't very impressive.  We had to hand-hold and request the server for everything we needed - whether it be a glass of water, utensils, napkins, some form of plate, etc.  Out of frustration, we ended up requesting other servers to help us out but even then the service was close to poor.    Though our meals were done correctly, it took a very long time by the server to actually get the food out to us.  It seemed like server needed to be reminded that we actually ordered food.  Not the greatest experience during game day.  I understand it can get busy and hectic, but that's not an excuse for service to fall behind either.  Overall, an okay experience.",

I'm a bartender and I usually don't do this but I am extremely unhappy with what happened when I came in. They were both extremely rude. I understand there's a wait so there is absolutely no need to talk to me like an idiot. They then sat my friends and I in a section that had NO SERVER. Us not knowing, we waited for 25 minutes before anyone came to help us. When we asked a server they scoffed and said \"you were seated in a section that doesn't have a server but I guess I'll take care of you\". Thank you for taking care of us Betsy, but really If you're really trying to not make money off of your service I recommend you trying something other than waiting tables. You took 15 minutes for 3 orders of water, you never checked on us when we got our food and you never refilled any of our waters. When it came to us needing something we asked another team member and they said \"I'll tell your server\" meaning I don't want to do it.  The team work there was awful! When we finally got our checks she mixed our payments up leaving us waiting even longer. She didn't even apologize when we brought it up. Just an \"oh\". The restaurant wasn't even busy and this is how our experience went. Talk about quantity over quality. I don't recommend this location at all!",

When we and others at our table got what we ordered was a different matter.  As the afternoon wore on the helpers had trouble getting orders to the correct tables.  And the young one (3) in our party had over a 1/2 hour wait for his ice cream.  I don't think they have enough staff for a football Sunday as Amber was visibly run ragged with her assigned sections.  I have had better and less expensive wings however we liked both of our sauce choices (Thai curry, Asian zing).  I actually preferred the sharing sides (Southwest bites and spinach chicken flat bread) we ordered later on.  The selection of beers was excellent.  The place was packed and noisy.  Our group ended up on the patio and it turned out to be better than we thought it would be.  Less noisy and easier to get up and socialize.  The parking lot was made for midget cars.

    "text": "B-dubs won my heart with their selection of wing sauces and plentiful carrots and celery.  Things I appreciate about a chicken wing: plenty of meat on the bone (yes, the bone. Chickens have bones), the opportunity for more than one flavor, and flavorful sauces that won't burn my face off.    My favorite sauce is honey bbq, which is pretty classic.  Asian Zing is very tasty, but it has a little bit of a kick.  And parmesan garlic is actually too strong a flavor!  There are a few others I would like to try, but I won't be venturing farther down the thermometer than Asian Zing.  You can split flavors into increments of 5, so sharing is great if you want to try a few sauces.  I've been in a couple of times to watch games or fights, and the atmosphere is great for that.  Good food that will keep on comin', there's usually a drink special of some kind, and TVs all around for easy viewing.  Keep in mind, if it's a major event making for a busy night, your whole party will need to be present before you will be seated.",

Very dissapointed  with Tempe burger.  No seasonings added, no sauce.  Norhing that  made  it any better than a low quality, cafeteria burger.  I know BWW is a wing joint but any decent restaurant that touts signature ingredients in its menu and doesn't follow through  is not going to have repeat business.  Caution-may be  relying too much on their college  location to be quality. 2 stars only because server was great.",

She was so rude.   Anyways I love my buy one get one free boneless wings. So I ended up staying and honestly the wings were okay this time around because I know when there fresh and they took the time to prepare them properly.   This is by far the grossest part, I have no idea how long there carrots have been sitting back in the back I'm attaching a picture below. But honestly with all the E. coli crap going around the romaine lettuce seeing how gross these carrots looked made things much worse. I don't know if I'll ever be coming back to this location. Hopefully this gets to upper management this most definitely needs to be addressed",

The last few times I ordered from this location they were nearly plain and I had to rub them on the bottom of the box to get seasoning which is unlike my experience at other locations.   Last time I called in a phone order, part of my order was missing and then instead of just giving me the box that was forgotten, I had to wait for them to remake it which then required me to put the rest of the food i ordered in the oven when i got home because it took so long. Food was ordered for pickup at 6:40, I was there at about 7, started to drive off, realized the mistake and turned around. Then didn't head home until about 7:40.  By then I was burnt out on even wanting wings. Lol I live pretty close so I was mentally prepared for it to be a quick and smooth trip. 20 minutes tops.  They gave me a card for free snack sized wings but i was disappointed to see it can only be redeemed at their location.  I just hope it'll be a quicker experience next time.",

I recently came in with a few friends and my girlfriend to get food before seeing a show. We arrived at 6:15pm to give us enough time to eat and leave by 7:30pm. They were fairly busy but not packed. It took us until about 6:25 before our waitress took our tables order. At about 7:05 we advised the waitress that we were in a hurry and we were wondering on the status of our food. She advised us that it would be out shortly. (Which was not True) at 7:25 our food arrives 5 minutes before we have to leave and to make matters worse EVERY order is messed up entirely. They gave me the complete wrong meal. My girlfriend who's a vegetarian for 10 years almost but into her burger not realizing that they screwed up and gave her meat instead of black bean. With us being in a rush we had no time to eat our food and we started to pack up. We advised the waitress of the situation and her response was that she could have the items corrected. We explained we were in a hurry and were forced to box up our incorrect meals pay for them and leave. I hesitated to write this review as I have had some great experiences at this Buffalo but sadly enough my last few visits have been just about as bad as this one.",

I feel I have been cheated for the money which I paid. I'm pretty sure, they wouldn't have served these wings if I had dined in at the restaurant. Just because I ordered a takeout and since there is no possibility of looking at the wings, they have given me such a miserable chicken. This meal just spoiled my evening. The wings can't get any worst than this. I would have got better wings at KFC. Unfortunately, I had to give ONE star since they didn't allow me to post this review with ZERO stars.",

    "text": "My wife and I love the food at BWW, but my most recent experience needs to be documented. We ordered take out on Boneless Thursday(yes I get it, it's busy on days like this), and was given a pick up time of 8:20(about 30 minutes after I submitted our order). Got there 5 minutes early, paid for my meal, and began to wait. I cannot tell you how many customers and grub hub employees surpassed me with picking up other orders as I continued to sit there and patiently wait. I was asked a few times what my name was on the order, with no follow up or apology for how long it was taking. After waiting for 30 minutes, one of the guys who left earlier with his takeout, returns. One of the BWW employees approaches him, takes the bag out of his hands, and heads to the kitchen. Shortly thereafter, my name is called and now it all makes sense. My order was given to someone else, but that was not acknowledged. They decided to play it cool and act like I didn't know what was going on. At this point I was not going to wait any longer so I checked my order real quick, but I didn't open every little thing. In my order, and clearly on my receipt, I asked for 2 sides of sauce for the tenders. Before I finally took off with my food, I asked for an extra side of sauce, just to be safe. The employee unenthusiastically went and got me one and I got out of there as I was frustrated with waiting in their hostess area for 30 minutes (25 minutes past my pick up time). I get home, open everything up and only have the 1 sauce that I asked for as extra. So pretty much if I wouldn't have asked for an extra one in that moment, we would have had none. I really just don't get how hard it is to follow instructions on a receipt and quality check it before giving it to a customer. Safe to say I'm gonna have to be that guy now that opens every little thing whenever I do take out cause I can't trust my order is all there. This on top of the ridiculous wait time made for quite a frustrating night. Never going back to this locayi",

Our waitress forgot the celery and carrots but that was okay. She wasn't very attentive anyway. Needs to improve.  Our drinks were empty we had to ask for more. Not a fan of this  particular site. I'm sure the college kids don't mind since there was a line to get in.",

    "text": "You gotta hand it to Buffalo Wild Wings: they are the place to go for football on a Sunday. With TVs lining the walls, you are definitely going to find the game you came in for. It should be noted that Sundays are PACKED - get there a half hour before your game is going to start. And if your game is at the same time as the Cardinals game, you may be sitting outside. Don't worry, they've got heaters in the winter and sprinklers in the summer for their patio :)  I like the layout of Tempe's Buffalo Wild Wings. The environment is always clean and the waitstaff is always very helpful. Being at a bar for 3+ hours can be a challenge for any waiter and these folks do it well. Our orders are always correct, our beers are always refilled in a timely manner, and they're always smiling and happy.  If you need a place to watch the game, go here! You'll love the wings, the beer, and the atmosphere.",

Mozzarella sticks were good and the Southwest bites were tasty.  Not sure what it is about their wing sauce (buffalo) but my stomach is always in knots the next day... I might not consider myself a wing aficionado, but Im probably pretty close and I havent had the side effects I get when I eat here anywhere else.  And it happens every time I eat their wings.  They do taste decent, just not sure if the product is worth the price anymore (and im not talking $$).  Best things about B dubs = LOTS of tv's, they get UFC ppv's, they have most football games and other sports on at least one tv.  Decent selection of beers, and they have games like golden tee and that trivia game to play if theres nothing on tv",

They are a national company that seems to be doing something right considering their success.  However, you'd think such success would translate to some kind of service standard.    I can tell from other reviews that I am not the only one that received remarkably bad service at this place.  It was the ASU v. UofA football game and the place was overflowing.  According to our server, the shortage of bartenders justified our second round of drinks taking more than an hour. MORE THAN AN HOUR!!!  Unfortunately for him, the lack of bartenders could not be blamed for the food taking even longer.    At one point, after checking three times to see if a runner had brought our drinks, someone got up from the table to ask him if they were ever going to come.  His response, \"You didn't order more drinks.\"  Let me say that again.  He checked back with us three times to see if we had gotten a round of drinks that, according to him, we never ordered.  Confused???  So were we.   If they keep this up, they won't last much longer than Six Shooters.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying...boneless buffalo wings are my weakness and I am in love with them!  That said...let's get to the review. This location doesn't really deserve even the one star they are getting.  First off, I ordered my wings and buffalo chips online and actually requested them for an hour later.  So I get there, right on time, and end up waiting about five minutes.  Okay, sure no problem, right!?  Well I get my order and head home.  Once I get home though I realize they had given me boned instead of boneless wings.  Since I'm not a fan of the regular wings, I hopped in my car and proceeded back to the establishment.  I get there and they apologize and hand me the corrected order.  Well I walk outside and get in my car and decided I should probably check to make sure it's right.  Well what do you know, they give me the wrong flavor and of course it's a gross flavor.  So I go back in told the cashier that it was wrong yet again.  She says, \"but you asked for boneless.\"  Once that came out of her mouth, I figured I wouldn't give them a third chance to screw up my order again so I asked for my money back.  She walks into the kitchen and after about 5 minutes of waiting, she comes back with the manager.  The manager doesn't apologize or anything, he just looks super annoyed that he has to take the time out to refund a customer.  Did I mention this was during lunch on a football packed Sunday?!  He proceeds to hand me a receipt to sign to show that I'm just paying for the buffalo chips....ummm yeah right!  I let him know that the wings and the buffalo chips were both in the bag and then he starts gripping at the cashier.  Finally, he figured out what the correct procedure was and informed me that the transaction was voided.  He then tries to hand me a $5 coupon for my troubles...needless to say, it ended up on the floor as I was leaving.  Never again will I walk into that BWW or any of their other locations.  That one experience has ruined any chance of me returning.",

    "text": "This Tempe outpost of Buffalo Wild Wings is their 700th store. Just about 3 blocks from the Rural/University train station, it's a very convienent location to access via transit. They do offer complimentary surface parking which is something that cannot be said for downtown Tempe locations.   The atmosphere is exactly the same as every other BWW. Over the top TV visual stimulation, bright white lights that would blind you if you looked into them, and a ridiculous amount of people in the restaurant at all times. I asked for one of the TVs to be tuned to the Diamondbacks game, and after trying to find it for 15 minutes, they put it on a small TV because the big one was carrying a U of A v. Iowa football game. Look, not only is this game a 4 days old replay, but you're in ASU territory so please put the LIVE broadcast of the HOME team on the big television. They refused. About 5 minutes later, another bar patron asked that same TV showing football to be changed to Cubs v. Giants, and there was no hesitation on their part to get this done. I was a little befuddled.   The food is shy of average. When I go to a place that specializes in buffalo wings, give me some decent buffalo wings. These things are tiny, overcooked, balls of grease. I tried the garlic parmesan, spicy garlic, medium, and asian zing sauces. The garlic parmesan was kind of gross, the asian zing was identical to the bottle of Mae Ploy sweet and spicy glaze I have in my refrigerator. The other two were fine sauces, but the meat portions and quality were crap.   On my visit, they had just opened two days prior so I'll cut them slack on the mishaps, which were plentiful, on the bartender/servers part. I won't however, write a review without mentioning the behavior of the managerial staff. Is this amateur hour? The TWO MANAGERS got out a book of ID cards which supposedly had every ID in the country with pictures and ways to tell if it's fake. Every out of state ID they saw, they referenced the book. What I have to ask is if they are managers of a big time chain restaurant, shouldn't they have seen an ID or two in their day? Don't they have a history of working in bars/restaurants? Shouldn't they have carded people in the past? I then watched them brushing their teeth behind the bar. Lost my damn appetite. The employees aren't being trained quickly because the management team is a bunch of buffoons.  FYI, if you recently turned 21 and have a vertical ID, don't go here because they won't take it. Someone needs to tell them they are by a college campus. I watched at least a dozen people be turned down for drinks because of the vertical ID.",

Each order already comes with one ranch so that means I should get a total of at least four ranches (more if they're nice).  When I paid for my food at the restaurant I politely said, \"hey, can you make sure that there's extra ranch in there for me?\"  The girl looked at me like she was annoyed by my question and said \"yeah.\"  When she brought out my food she handed me the bag, I said thank you, and she walked back into the kitchen without saying a word.  I looked in the bag and there were only 3 ranches in there, which was no big deal, so I asked the hostess if \"it would be possible for me to get a couple more ranches.\"  She said \"yeah sure\" and went in the kitchen, then came back out and said \"umm it's gonna be an extra 60 cents per ranch.\"  I said \"ok, but I did order extra ranch on the phone and I only got 3 in here.\"  She told me that if I order extra ranch I should only get \"like 3 or 4.\"  I didn't feel like arguing so I gave her the $1.20 for another two ranches.  I'm a little agitated that I was treated like some kind of a**hole when I don't think I could have been more polite.  I don't really care that I had to pay extra for the ranch.  I was more concerned about the way these girls were talking to me.  I work at a restaurant so I know that some customers can be a**holes, but there's no reason to treat polite customers like a**holes just for asking for extra ranch.",

I told the waitress to change the billing to what a normal receipt looks like and she did. They also did not charge us the correct happy hour prices. The bill also had the food on it that was 10 minutes late. The manager did take care of it removing that item and was very nice.

    "text": "When reviewing a national chain, the review should primarily be focused on activities that are highly variable such as:  - ambiance (different stores have different layouts) - service (this is highly variable) - Cleanliness (stores vary) - etc.  Large chains like BWW are great at being consistent in their food recipes and menu selection, a mango habanero wing in Florida will virtually taste the same as a mango habanero wing in Arizona. This is standard for all large companies, Mcdonalds wants everyone to have the same experience when ordering a Bigmac, regardless of where they get it from, this is the same with BWW because of this my review will primarily be focused on services and ambiance of the restaurant.   *Ambiance - The restaurant is extremely clean as it should be for being a little more than a year old. Big screen tv's are plastered on every square inch of the walls. The space is big and wide, being cramped will be the least of your worries.   *Service - Due to it being Wing Tuesday the place was swamped and unfortunately BWW was severely understaffed. Based on past experience at other BWW, I waited far too long for my server to come by to take my order. The food also took much longer than usual for a Tuesday, this tempe branch needs to staff appropriately, when in doubt overstaff.   *Cleanliness - A+ here, no rants =D   *Consistency  - They were out of carrots. I repeat no carrots. I ordered the veggie boat that comes with celery and carrots, but again no carrots. They also ran out of cole slaw cups. The supply chain at this restaurant is in dire need of a makeover, they stocked out of carrots and cole slaw cups for goodness sake!   Conclusion.  Food is consistent with other BWW's I have been to. What sets this branch apart from the rest is its lack of preparation. - Understaffed for an easily foreseen busy Tuesday. - Stockouts of carrots! I love my carrots with my habanero wings! - Stockouts of Coleslaw cups. I hope they fix their supply chain!",

Everytime I go there it's practically empty - which I guess doesn't ALWAYS signify a bad establishment - but in this case I think it may.    The wing Tuesdays are nice and cheap, and as long as you're drinking domestic beers (crappy domestics...) then your bill won't be so high. I was really P-O'd when I found out that local beers didn't count as $3 domestics!!! Hello, Four Peaks is right down the road and you're gonna charge me 6.50 for a pint during HAPPY HOUR?!  Please.  Also, skip the boneless wings. They are just glorified, over breaded chicken nuggets. Ick.",

We came in a girl, her name was Callie, gave my boyfriend and I our drinks, about five minutes later I received a phone call and told him to order for me while I took my call outside, I return almost 20 minutes later he says that neither the girl that gave us our drinks or the guy, Nate, had looked his way since I left. About five minutes after that Callie finally takes our order, she gets my order wrong, because she did not write it down, it happens, I ate it, didn't complain, and we sat there for another 20 minutes as Nate, walked to and from his POS system and ignoring every customer at the bar unless they yelled and waved for him, he even made eye contact with us in the mirror behind the POS and still ignored me, it's seemed as though Callie was now at the well and Nate was suppose to be in charge of customers at the bar. Get it together. Either get some better bartenders that can actually handle the well themselves instead of a all hands on deck mentality. Because every customer actually sitting at that bar received terrible service if any at all.",

And the only food we would: bone-in wings (we tried their breaded...mehhhh, a little too \"synthetic\" tasting) and their potato wedges.  Their potato wedges are just the perfect size... one biters! And they are crunchy outside but soft inside...delish.  The only flavours that set them apart from the other wing places are the Mango Habanero and Asian Zing. Other than that, their wings are just about the same as the other places.   A special shout-out to the Asian-American server who works there. He is definitely the NICEST and most helpful BWW server in the Valley. Give him a raise or a promotion!  Oh, and lastly, $1.20 for two little dinky containers of ranch on Tues? Come on, for that price I could get a biggle bottle of ranch from Fry's and feed the whole table AND take it home.",

In the past she has given me serious attitude, does not go over the menu, or list ANY specials, she does not fill up or water, we walk up to the soda machine and ASK for water. PATHETIC! We received a discount the last time we had her but this time is completely unreal! How in the right mind do you come up to a customer and ask why I didn't tip you enough?!?! We came to watch the NBA Finals. There were 7 of us, we all ate around 6 and and didn't leave until 9pm. Someone from our party left without paying which tends to happen sometimes when you stay for a long period of time. I had contacted my friend and she was on her way back before we even got our tabs! Amoora came up to us, talking with her hand on her hip being rude as can be telling us we can't leave until they come back. Which is totally understandable for her to say IF WE WERE READY TO LEAVE! WE WERE STILL SITTING AND TALKING AND HAVE NOT PAID OURSELVES! I didn't say anything after her being rude. But for a waitress to come up to a guest and ask for a good tip?!?!? I could NOT BELIEVE THIS! I have never had a problem with anyone else! She is just not fit compared to the rest of the amazing workers there. SO DISAPPOINTED!!",

They have over 20 different sauces that you can put on your wings.  They also have some special sauces that come and go.  Recently, they have begun serving a Captain Morgan sauce... Let me tell you, even if you are not a fan of the rum, you will be a fan of this sauce.  It's sweet with a little bit of kick, and it's a ton better than their honey barbecue.  Try and come on Tuesdays or Thursdays.  They have Wing Specials these days that make their wings much more affordable... After all I would rather not pay $5.99 for 8 Boneless Wings.  That's outrageous.  If you want delicious wings, look no further.",

My three sauces of choice are Asian Zing, Parmesan Garlic, and Mango Habanero. Boneless wings are fried to crispy perfection. Cheddar cheese curds are a hit too. I knock a star off because BDubs tries to serve more than they can actually serve WELL. Stick to the wings, apps, and beers and you're golden.",

    "text": "I came here a couple of weeks back to meet a group of Yelpers for beer, wings, and football.  The location worked for everyone, I'm not sure we picked it because we thought BWW was anything amazing, it was just convenient and met our criteria.   I have been to multiple BWW's many times and I just do not like them.  Service is always mediocre, no matter how busy or slow.  Our server on this occasion was actually a cutie pie and was very good natured as some of the boys at our table were flirting and joking with her and even as worn out as the poor thing was, she still interacted and had fun with them.  My complaint (having been a server before) is the way they had servers assigned to tables.  She not only had inside tables, but the patio as well.  When it is busy like this they need to be more strategic about assigning sections to servers so they are not constantly running.  The needs of the customer are bound to get neglected and their staff is going to be ragged not even halfway into a very long football Sunday.   This time around at BWW I had the fried mushrooms with a house salad.  I can honestly say these are probably the worst fried shrooms I've ever had.  Extremely doughy with a mushroom the size of a button inside.  Yuck.  The salad was far from fresh.  The lettuce was obviously wilted and that was pretty much all there was to it with the exception of a cucumber or two and some tomatoes.  I tried a friend's boneless wings and thought the meat was dry and there was not enough sauce.  I like my wings drenched in saucy yumminess.   The reason I give this place two stars is I discovered a new beer that I am a big fan of. Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  Make sure you ask for an orange garnish.    Am I a fan? No.  Would I come back and just drink beer for the pleasure of good company? Yes.",

Today's mission? Drink, eat and watch Football! It was pretty busy, and why not? This is a cool place. I don't care if it's a chain. Good is good.  I am cutting our primary server quite a bit of slack because she put up with quite a bit (she had several tables scattered throughout the restaurant on a busy Sunday). I won't go into the details.  Here is where she really came through for me. I ordered Mango Habanero boneless wings and like a True wuss, they were too spicy for me. Yeah. Me. The Indian. Anyway, our server was kind enough to take them back, and brought me a replacement with a mild sauce so I could eat a proper meal.  My beers came out at the right temperature, and whenever I needed something, she was there to help me, no matter how distracted I seemed by all the games.  When it came time to pay up, she didn't mess up. We had a party of about 15-20 people over the course of the day and we never had to deal with the \"who ordered what\" because she automatically split our tabs up, without asking. She knew what was up.  When the evening progressed, and it slowed down, she even took some time to visit with us for a few minutes. This was AFTER we paid. So she wasn't doing this to get a higher tip. She was just a nice person.   Kudos to Amber.   A note for those who are like me and hate eating and drinking outside....this patio is perfect. Even on a 100 degree day. The patio is fully shaded and has plenty of misters. It's perfect.   If you want to read reviews about their wings, and the sauces, there are plenty of other 4 and 5 star reviews.   This place is awesome. Great place to watch sports. If you are in the area.  One last note. They have Pinnacle Whipped Vodka. You can get an Orange Julius Shot. It will touch your soul.",

    "text": "As far as bdubs go this one was pretty standard. Nice to get a seat right away at 6 pm and service was average. Food was similar to every other Buffalo Wild Wings, came our hot and in a timely manner. Only real complaint was that it was pretty dingy, and my fiance saw fruit flies above our food multiple times. Overall there are probably lots of better places to go in the Tempe university area, but there was no glaring sign not to go back here. Good for those who are ok with a little filth and looking for a standard meal that is not out of the ordinary",

    "text": "3.5 stars. I want to give them 4, but I won't. That being said, I would definitely come back for more, i'm just saying my experience probably could have been better. I don't hate it at all, so don't take offense to the 3 instead of 4 star :P.  Got in, they had a nice dining area, or the bar, you get to choose where. There are Tv's wall to wall showing whatever's good, and even one showing a digital poker match going on inside the bar, which is pretty cool. The menu was great, the prices were decent, my brother and I split 6 mango habanero, 6 asian zing, and 6 chipotle. Then we also split mini corndogs (half off for happy hour), and a basket of potato wedges (not half off). The chipotle wings were crap, it was like they cooked wings and seasoned them and served it to us, just tasted like dry salty wings. The asian zing had a nice crispy spicy and sweet glaze on them, similar to a spicy zing i've tried before, very good. The mango habanero was the bomb though, glazed a bit, slightly sweet, with a kick of habanero, delicious! I tried mango habanero somewhere else before, and man it tasted like shit, it was like saucy and wet mango curry was on the wings or something. But Buffalo wild wings did mango habanero right! The mini corndogs were pretty good, though they forgot to give us the \"honey mustard\", which when we requested it didn't taste like \"honey\" mustard at all, just normal mustard, whatever though. The potato wedges were great! They had a nice seasoning to them, slightly less undercooked compared to that of KFC's, which I would prefer more, but these were delicious enough  Service was decent, but could have been better, they didn't seem to pay much attention, they were having more fun with their co-workers, which is fine by me, I don't blame them, work can get boring sometimes.   As a generous yelper, I'm so tempted to give them a 4 star rating.. No harm to ya though Buffalo Wild Wings, I'm sure the next time I come around I'll have a better experience, and I will be back for another round for sure :).",

    "text": "Pretty well known restaurant chain that's known for buffalo wings with a sport bar theme. Plenty of screens to have sports going on while you eat and has plenty of choices from wings to salads. It seems of recent they've changed the menu a bit to expand outside of just wings.   I'm a big fan of the garlic parmesan wings but I really was interested in the street tacos since they blend the grilled chicken with the garlic parmesan sauce. Really those tacos are really good, light and has a great overall flavor. Kind of on the smaller side but really delicious. They also have hand breaded chicken strips that are huge and plenty of food to feed two. One thing I liked seeing on the menu is the expanded menu outside of just fried food. I always come out of bww feeling like I ate nothing healthy.   All is all, typical sports bar with lots of bar food choices. Service is good but not great. It's one of my go to places to eat at before I head into a ASU football game for some wings and good food",

Mind you it's not that busy right now, I asked for a soda once our food came out I told the server that helped in the beginning and then the server that brought us our food and still haven't got my soda. Then my wings were cold and hard like they have been sitting around for a while. Didn't even finish them because of how cold they were. There's a lot of people waiting for tables to get cleaned and they haven't been cleaned I don't know if they are short staff or what but tonight was really bad service in general. Only reason I'm giving them a 2 star is because the beer was cold. Probably will be my last time coming to this location.  Came In again on 9/18 service was horrible again it's not packed or nothing and she's still doing a horrible job I just don't know what it is about this location but the service is always bad.",

    "text": "Without a doubt the absolute worst Buffalo Wild Wings visit ever. The restaurant was disgusting. We chose to sit at the high tops in the bar except all SIX unsat tables in the bar were un-bused . We went back to the front to be sat at a table in the dining area and there were THREE more un bused tables that remained that way for quite some time. Our order took exceptionally longer time than anticipated. My date ordered Medium sized traditional wings with Asian Zing, I ordered Medium sized traditional wings half sweet bbq half sweet honey and a side salad. When the order arrived my date ended up getting a medium sized half Asian Zing and half Medium sauce. My salad was HOT and came out with the wings. Probably because it say in the Warner window with our food.  As dissatisfied as we were we reluctantly ate our food due to the time of night and the fact that we were too hungry to complain. Which would have made no difference because there was not a manager in sight.  Needless to say I (we) will never return to this location again. IN & OUT Burger is just up the way and a cheaper alternative.",

Not normally my go to wing stop, but I do like their dry rub, wings, so we all decided to give it a go!  Our service started out so good, our waiter was so cool! Very nice manners, and friendly, he told us how Arby's just recently purchased Buffalo Wild Wings, and how they only use fresh beef patties, never frozen, and how much better their burgers are, they also are no longer using Romain, and spinach in their restaurants due to all the recalls on those items.   Our super friendly waiter took our order of all flats and extra crispy with our sauce choices. We ordered a side of fries, queso cheese dip, and fried pickles. The fries came out cold and old, the fried pickles hot, but tasted of old grease, that needs to be changed. The cheese dip and chips were good. (Fries and pickle chips barely touched.)  Next our wings came out, the only thing they got right was the sauce choice and that they were all flats. They all were warm and soggy. Or \"slimy \" as we say when a bad wing is delivered. Horrible dining experience!  Our friendly waiter notified his manager, the manager opted not to come by our table, but offered a few \"snack\" size vouchers that can only be used once per visit.   We left 2 medium, and 2 small wing orders on the table and paid our bill, and left!  I felt it was very unprofessional for manager for not coming over and talking about the poor quality of food!  I'll never go back! They couldn't even execute a crispy wing, or hot fries!!!  I mean, it's what they SHOULD do best, they're a wing restaurant after all!!!",

    "text": "So..... I order Buffalo Wild Wings for delivery fairly regularly through Door Dash.    I've never actually been inside the restaurant but I have to tell you that I only order the wings with the dry rub and not the sauce. I order typically the salt and vinegar wings and the chipolte style wings all with a dry rub and they're all freakin great.   I always order the extra large wings and never the smaller the medium and I've never actually had any of their side dishes or anything else. It's always just the wings with the various types of dry rub. So all I can tell you is that I'm very happy with the limited amount of wings and I get. They are always flavorful and they are always good.  So I suppose this review is pretty limited to just large wings delivered to my door. But I have to tell you the wings I have had are great.",

Generally just seemed uninterested in serving or doing their job. When asking for something or having a question about the menu--they acted as if it was such a hassle for them to answer a question or help us out. Friendliness level--probably a 1.5/5.  Happy hour menu--garbage. There's not even a physical menu for you to look at with the discounted prices or times of when happy hour lasts til. So maybe that's why the servers were unhappy with us, bc they had to restate everything that's on the happy hour menu to different ppl in our party? Regardless, it doesn't make sense why you would not have a physical happy hour menu for your customers to see.   If there was one bright spot here, I'd say it would be that their sangria was really good. But I didn't drink nearly enough to block out the poor service and general distaste this place gives you.",

I know, it's not a fancy restaurant and mainly focused on beer and sports, but I still expected the food to at least come out hot.   We walked in, with tons of people just standing around with no host or anyone to help anyone. We finally flagged down a server and he told us it was open seating by the bar. We sat, ordered some mozzarella sticks, wings, fries, and some drinks.  Food came and almost everything was cold. We are the wings as is, but had to send the fries back because they where cold as ice. We asked for ranch many times but it finally got delivered when we asked a completely different server.   The bill came and I noticed i got charged more for a completely different drink than I had. Not sure if that was a sneaky way of getting more or an honest mistake.   Overall, the food was cold and the service was terrible for a pretty pricy bill. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

The wings are served with choice of blue cheese and ranch generous helpings of celery and carrots. We also got the cheese curds and chocolate fudge cake (comes with ice cream and chocolate sauce)  Service is a little slow and they get super busy on weekends.

Service was good by the bartender and not to much time before we received our wings. However, we also got a large side of fries. Those were dissatisfying! Not fresh, (left overs) that were clearly dry and re-fried. Very disappointed in the kitchen serving this to us!  On the plus side of this chain ; At least 40 tvs showing various sports channels -TVs throughout the restaurant!Competitive prices & huge choices of chicken options with all sorts of side dishes, dry spice rubs and sauces.

I ordered half lemon pepper wings which are usually powerful in flavor, mine were a bit dry and bland, and the other half traditional buffalo wings that were lacking sauce, bummer. My fiance ordered honey barbecue and those were a little better. The flavors were just not as potent as we've had before at other locations. The onion rings were really good though, super hot and fresh when they came out and the batter was delicious.   Customer service was okay... our waiter was nice but he kept taking forever to come back to our table, whether it was to deliver the waters that we ordered or to take our orders. Then after we got our food he never checked back on us and I had to wait forever to receive the blue cheese dressing that I previously ordered with my chicken. Can we say annoying...

Shelby really familiarized herself with our orders and we maybe come in once a week if that. She's just really nice and provides us with all the options to make our dining experience a great one! Love that I can count on seeing her during the lunch hour.",

Now the service on the other hand....  no one helps each other, the Sony clear the tables no one is polite, attitudes suck. You'll see your drink sitting at the bar while your server and every other server just walks by it.  Here is a tip... Full hands in, full hands out. Even if it's not your table help, help your team run smooth it's simple.  However the manager is great we had a complaint at the beginning of our meal and he handled it right away so that is good. I'll be back just hope they have a team meeting.",

It was my co-worker's bday and she loves this place so we all decided to order here for lunch, I figured safe to order teriyaki thinking you can't go wrong - light, sweet and salty.  All I got was salty, seriously my heart rate jumped immediately after one wing.  Hubby thinks it eat pretty salty already, but figured I would take them home for his take on it.  He agrees whomever made the sauce didn't taste it and just dumped too much salt/soy into the mix.  13 of the 16 pieces went to the trash, what a waste of money!

It's a little too pricey for boneless wings I must say. I had the parmesan garlic wings and the chicken 'burlitos', which basically was a soft chicken taco. I don't recommend the parmesan garlic wings, it's wayyyy too saucy and the chicken burlitos was a disappointment.   The only good thing about this place is that there's plenty of TV's to watch any sports game.",

    "text": "I went here tonight to watch the Kansas vs Western Kentucky game. I knew it would be busy so I showed up early and patiently waited for a high top in the bar since I was alone. After I got a table my waiter was right there but it took awhile to get my beer, at least he took my wing order. When he delivered my beer and wings he didn't come back till my glass was empty. It took 15 minutes to get my new beer. According to my waiter it was because the tap had bown, but I saw the bartender pouring the same beer.   As I am getting ready for the game I notice that the two big screens in the bar are on different games. Mind you I didn't expect both but 1 was on a lower seed game and the other was on a game that didn't star for 20 min. I asked for the channel to be changed and was told they don't change channels. I was shocked that a #1 team was going to only be on small TVs and started looking for my waiter to cash out, but he was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a nice waitress got me my tab but I had to go give it to my waiter. He took his own sweet time even though I was trying to leave to miss as little as the game as possible. He was a bad waiter and whoever the young girl in the white worker shirt was that said she wouldn't change the channel is an idiot.  They get two stars for 2 reasons: the waitress that helped me get out of there faster and the manager who valiantly tried to keep me there. By that time I was shocked, pissed and I had tabbed out but at least he tried. bad service, and idiotic game scheduling will keep me out of this location for a long while.",

Not a minute after our food arrived a roach crawled across our table through my food from the wall. I screamed with a serious phobia of bugs and jumped up and say on another table. I got the waitress who got the manager right away. The manager came to talk with us and just as she did the roach came back and \"BAM\" she stepped on it and motioned the waitress back over. She asked if I wanted new food because the roach had gone on my food but my appetite had gone and I was very pale and felt like I was going to pass out or throw up. She didn't offer a voucher for next time or a gift card. She comped our meals but it didn't mean much because I didn't really get to eat at all. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a food establishment and would recommend steering clear of this play until they get sprayed or something.",

Then our waters took about another 10 min. We ordered lunch right away because we were in a hurry and I specified 3 times to her that I wanted my quesadilla plain to which she replied \"I got it, no problem\". Well about 25 maybe 30 minutes go by and we finally get our food. Yes you guessed it! Pico de gallo was all over and inside my quesadilla. I am allergic to tomatoes so of course I asked for a new one. She then blamed it on the cooks which I know wasn't True because she simply had too many parties and probably just forgot. She then brings me out my new quesadilla and it's delicious but that also took another 15-20 min. At this point my friend is done with her meal and needs to leave. So I scarfed my food and we got ready to pay. We split the bill of course and my friend paid cash. I paid with a card and everything was dandy. Until I got home and checked my bank account. My lovely server charged my card for both of our meals and didn't even mention to me that she did that. This missing money from my account was a complete surprise later when I was going through my bank account.  1st off can someone please explain to me why I even paid for my meal that took 45 min to get?  2nd, why didn't a manager or my server mention to me that they over charged my card? I am now out that money.  So thanks BWW I will NEVER be back!",

Buffalo Wild Wings is one of those places that I come to only if I have a gift card--I put them in the same bucket as Applebee's, Chili's, etc. Don't take that the wrong way--this isn't to say that I don't like places like those, in fact their food is usually consistent and sometimes I like to know what I'm getting into before I leave the house. The most fun parts about this particular BBW is hanging out around fellow Sun Devils, eating wings on a special pricing night (Tuesday for bone-in and Thursdays for boneless), and playing the free fake-money video poker (feels like I'm playing with someone else's paycheck, good stuff).  I don't think I've ever ordered anything other than the wings. Wings definitely don't disappoint--I recommend the Caribbean Jerk, Honey BBQ mixed with lemon pepper (special order), and Blazin' (not for the weak-hearted). I've noticed that BBW's wings are a bit meatier than nearby Native New Yorker--this may just be me, however. Drink selection at BBW may be good for some, but they don't really have anything special when it comes to beer which is a personal disappointment, but I can get past this to have a good meal.  All in all, pretty good for what it is.",

As for their wings, I like a lot of their sauces, especially the mango habenero and honey BBQ.

    "text": "My buddies and I know came here on a Sunday because we were going to hold our annual draft here. One of my friends had reserved this place maybe a month ago so I was really excited about that since there was no hassle. We got there maybe 15 minutes early before our reserve time and they were able to take care of us. Our table was near the entrance. It was enough for at least two draft parties.    The waitress we got was really good. She was patient and very professional because sometimes a party of 15 I assume can be overwhelming because of different orders and special requests, but all in all she was excellent. I'd so the only down side was a miscommunication when it came to the check because there was an item on there that I feel we didn't order. I think one of my buddies took care of it and we moved on. Speaking of the food, I'm not really a big fan of most of their items, but I did think in my opinion the mango habenero is really good, just a little spicy. The other item was a dessert item called cinnamon squares and those were just something you had to get another order of.   Overall, that day we went I thought everything I had planned went very smoothly. So, for us reserving the place at Buffalo Wild Wings for our draft party they provided us with some goodies. They provided us with a draft chart and stickers of the players name so we can put together ourselves. There was a championship flag, coupons to share within the group, coasters with our draft numbers, and also bottle openers. I thought that was cool with all the items, but slightly prefer last years because they provided us with a beer can holder and everyone in our draft got a $10 gift card. Hopefully, they can change that back, but all in all it was a pleasant experience for a draft and we'll definitely make sure we hold our draft party here again!!",

So I guess we're suppose to eat like animals. THIRD OF ALL, the chicken was DRY ASF, NO dipping sauce for our DRY ASS chicken. To make it WORSE, the \"Mac & Cheese\"... HAD NO FUCKING CHEESE!!! So with this shit being said, DO NOT BRING YO ASS TO THIS PLACE!!! Unless you just DO NOT give a FUCK about a Fair restaurant experience...",

He constantly checks up on his tables and makes sure everyone got everything. He's the go to guy at this location, will always try to look for him! Bryant deserves 5 stars but the location still sucks.",

The happy hour is decent.  $3 Vodka & Cranberry.  $3 garlic mushrooms.  I wouldn't pay more than that for either item.  I tried the $1.99 veggies with medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  Of course the veggie and blue cheese were fine but I didn't care for the medium flavored buffalo sauce.  I also had the soft pretzels with queso and garlic parm sauce.  The pretzels are small and hard and have no flavor.  The queso is icky and so is the garlic parm sauce.  I like that kid drinks are free but my kids didn't care for the wings, boneless wings or small burger.  They do like the dessert pizza but it is $7!!!  Plus they had no cheesecake bites the second time we had it.  The service once was fine and the second time was horrible and slow.  Also the TV's are so loud it hurts my ears.",

    "text": "This BWW location is a solid 4-star-er.  Pros: -Wings and tons of sauces (my faves: honey BBQ, asian zing) -Offer low-fat ranch, regular ranch and bleu cheese for wing dips -Good happy hour food and drink specials -Tuesdays - regular wing specials -Thursdays - boneless wing specials -Service - I've ALWAYS had very accommodating servers and bartenders, including changing TV channel to a different game -Calorie counts on menus - make better informed decisions  Cons: -Noise level - it's CRAZY loud in here, even when there are no major games on -Misters do a better job of cooling down the area OUTSIDE of the patio than they do cooling the actual patio area. -Dry seasoning (in lieu of sauces) - avoid -Calorie counts on menus - you'll quickly realize you're about to consume 1k calories, minimum  They've also recently added a new position that is sort of a 'good time coordinator' if you will.  She will offer little beer tasters (though I found out that I cannot sip, but rather have to slam down any liquid given to me in a shot glass...oops.).  She also coordinates promo events and the wing challenge.  A few weeks ago, they had a competition where you could guess the USA Olympic medal counts to win up to 50 free wings...  And I won!  50 FREE WINGS!  Obviously I'll be back for my freebies and others.  Dietary tip: Get the naked tenders with your favorite wing sauce and sub a side salad for the fries to make a very filling meal for at least half the calories of everything else on the menu.  Thanks to my pal Paulie D. for that one!",

    "text": "This is my first (and probably only) experience at BWW. They looked quite busy when I arrived, so I headed straight to the surprisingly small bar, being a single diner. I waited quite a while to get noticed standing, but will not put timelines here because I didn't realize then it was going to be an issue. I finally caught the attention of a server refilling a water behind the bar, and she brought me to the bartender's attention. He informed me that no one was leaving soon, so I headed back to the host stand. They were accommodating there, informed me there was just one party ahead of me unless I wouldn't mind a tiny table. That was perfect for me but I didn't realize it was an INVISIBLE table. Again I waited for some time but still felt quite forgiving. When Alison arrived she was pleasant enough; asked for a drink order, and instead I put in my entire order, later wishing I had asked for my side salad first. Is this an option servers give diners? And I understand the volume you are doing but I so prefer to give a temperature on my burger. Everything came at once and brought by a different server. She dropped my food and started to leave; very loud in there and I felt badly I had to raise my voice for 'Hey can I get some silverware?'. She looked under that ridiculous amount of napkins that had been left (managers, product cost?) as if I had not seen my roll up. As she went to retrieve one, I realized I had no pepper or mustard. When she dropped my roll up off- I had to get up and follow her to ask for the condiments, which then seemed difficult to find. Finally started on my salad while my burger got cold. Alison DID do a check-back which was impressive, but before I even GOT to my burger she came back and offered dessert? My water was never refilled; I got Alison's attention and gave her my card, and my receipt came with no itemized receipt. No one said goodnight to me on the way out. I would blame this poor service on being so busy, but the entire time I was there I saw plenty of servers milling around.",

    "text": "I grew up on wings... back in the day, my friends and I would eat at Native New Yorker 2-3 times per week; wings were 10 cents a piece - it was cheaper to eat at Native than McDonalds! Native is and always has been my barometer for wings. I'm not saying that's right or that's wrong, but that's what I got. I've never been to Buffalo so I can't measure anyone's wings to the \"original\".  Wings are - and always have been - a meal, not an appetizer. That's how we ate em in high school, that's how I still eat them. A plate of 10, MAYBE a dozen if I'm super duper hungry and the accompanying celery and carrots. My husband on the other hand views wings as strictly a starter.  At any rate, desiring a protein fix, we headed off in the Ferrari of Minivans to the local Buffalo Wild Wings in an attempt to \"try something new\". Granted, I'm not big on chain restaurants for \"trying something new\" - I'd much rather go someplace locally owned. But I digress.  We went to this location on campus and I was quickly shocked at how \"barry\" the place was... I was expecting more of a restaurant than a bar. Oh well, there were other kids there, but - being Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, there was an abundance of raucous, young (and dare I say, handsome) men watching the game on a variety of TVs and mawing down wings.   Alas, they had a kids menu, so that settled it - we were NOT the first people to bring a kid to BWW!  Our waitress was very helpful, fast on her feet - all around a great waitress. She deserves top marks! Then the \"Team Captain\" came by and really introduced us to the wide world of wings. Back in the day, all you had was HOT, MEDIUM or MILD... now, there is a veritable cornucopia of sauces and styles, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. Our Team Captain had us try them all (with fries)  Want an Asian flare? They got it. Curry on your mind? They got it. Feelin jerk-y? Try the Caribbean.  Don't want sauce, but a dry rub? They got it. Wings are their own \"cuisine\" now, and not just some easy, cheap thing to throw together (and the prices match... what used to cost me a buck has decupled (increased tenfold...)  Bottom line, the people we encountered at BWW did a great job of representing their brand and their service alone will probably draw me back.  Let's move on to the food. I deign to say I'm a wing \"purist\", but maybe I am... I found their sauces, while creative and plentiful, not very palatable. They had this mass-produced, non-fresh, full of corn syrup and additives and preservatives taste and feel. There was this \"creaminess\" to the sauces that was just... not appealing. The wings themselves were huge - meaty, very ample sized wings... in fact, I could barely finish five and I'm used to eating 10 or 12. They were cooked perfectly, not a bad one in the bunch. The ranch dressing, like the wing sauce, had a mass-produced, non-fresh flavor and feel to it.   Bottom line - great place to watch a game in a clean, open, environment and the staff is great. Food? Hmm.. just not there for me.",

I hate that nickname.  DISCLAIMER: I don't really enjoy loud and crowded restaurants or sports bars in general, so I'm totally and utterly biased. If you're like me at all, you won't enjoy it.  If you are NOT like me, you will probably enjoy it as much as my friends seem to.  If you love meat, alcohol, sports and the possibility of seeing lots of college floozies, you will absolutely LOVE it. I'm serious. You really will. I hope you have fun!  -I'm on a super tight budget, so the wings are too pricey for me. BUT, they do have a huge variety of flavors, so if you can afford it and like wings, I definitely recommend trying them. You WILL find a flavor you like.  -For 6 or 7 dollars, you only get a couple of mozzarella sticks, which is disappointing, and although they are not the best, they are good. -At 2 or 3 dollars, the cheapest thing on the menu is the veggie tray, which has a generous amount of freshly cut carrot sticks and celery, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  There are hundreds of huge TVs so scanning the room, you're bound to find something to watch. I actually had a passable time there when the Olympics were on.  The waitresses have always been friendly and helpful.   I am a quiet, college age person with no interest in sports or loud, crowded restaurants and I would never, ever, ever, ever come here on my own volition.

I have been here 3 times since moving to Arizona, and each time it has gotten worse(somehow). The first time I went here, there were people soliciting services at our table to make donations to something not even worth mentioning. Twice we had our dinner interrupted by impatient rude kids asking for money. When we declined the first time, they came back. How can we enjoy our dinner when people are harassing us asking for handouts?  The second time our waitress was nowhere to be found. Forget refills, forget napkins. But that wasn't even the most shocking thing. Our waitress forgot to give us straws for our drinks...not a big deal at all. So I asked a waitress who was walking by if she could please give us a couple of straws(which I could see hanging out of her server apron), and she made a face and said \"you'll have to ask your server for that.\" FOR STRAWS? REALLY?  The third time? This was absolutely insane. It was Friday night 03/10/17, my girlfriend and I came in well OVER an hour before closing and it seemed they were already closing up shop. That's fine I get it, get to cleaning duties early on so you can have an easy close. But the experience was if they were closing in 5 minutes. Our server, didn't say his name, came up to the table and literally said \"hey whats up, what do you guys want\" in a dismissive tone. I looked at my girlfriend, then back at him and ordered drinks and he didn't ask if we were ready to order he was about to run off. Told him we were ready and he didn't say \"okay\" or anything he just pulled his pad out to write and looked at me.  We ordered extra crispy wings, and some fries, not a big deal.  Get this, he leaves and comes back in less than 3 minutes.  The chicken was soggy, some pieces were cold, some were warm. The fries were ACTUALLY cold like they had been sitting out all night. So when I reached for them before he walked off I said \"excuse me these fries are cold...\"  He grabs them and says \"oh Sh*t, sorry about that\". He comes back in another 2 minutes with the SAME basket of fries heated up??? How about some fresh fries? Not old fries that have been reheated several times? Let's not forget we didn't have napkins, plates, utensils(I grabbed these from the table behind me, and used one napkin all night). Never. NEVER again. Gilbert and Superstition will always have my business unless this place changes its management and well, everything.",

    "text": "Now I know why the ratings suck. Sitting on the patio and everyone around us has cups of water. Fine, maybe they asked but it's happy hour and I asked if there's a menu? Why give me a menu when you can tell like 5 things ABOUT the menu instead. Like why would I want to read it and see my options. So I just had to stick to my beer. Oh I had to hunt down my waiter to get those beers. I usually don't write reviews but today I felt like I had to. I just want to have some drinks, branch out but I definitely felt limited. After being denied a drink menu seems kind of redundant to come here again for happy hour. I was so excited too! It's been awhile since I've been to BWW, maybe a different location next time?",

    "text": "My past experiences at B Dubs have always been quite delicious, enjoyable and often for dinner. Today, I decided to try it out for lunch with my boyfriend. The disappointment began with our disinterested host who unfortunately ended up as our server. Not only did he did not propose any lunch specials or wing specials to us at the beginning of our experience, but he never mentioned his name or welcomed us in. He impatiently took our order and snatched away the specials menu while my boyfriend was still looking at it. We typically eat at B Dubs for the specials so this was a tad frustrating. Our food was brought to us by a kind food runner, but our server did not return to the table for check ins. Finally, he dropped the check without stopping at the table or saying a word. After about 20 minutes of us waiting for him to return for the check, I said \"excuse me\" as he walked by. He ignored me and continued walking, but thank goodness for another server who overheard me and tended to our closing needs. Our server failed to complete our payment with a gift card until a manager stepped in. I saw our server roll his eyes towards me and our table two or more times during our 70 minute, \"lunch rush\" experience. Disappointed and frustrated is an understatement. I hope this man is not your server in the near future.   Food was still pretty good though, thus the second star being added.",

Every imaginable game on TV.   It took awhile for our waitress to come to our table because they were so busy but once she came the service was really good. Taking our drink & dinner order. I was thinking about a burger and then realized where I'm at. It's Wild Wings so what are they known for wings. So many selections for the wings sauce. I ordered the boneless wings with Honey BBQ and Chipotle BBQ wet with Ranch. Really good. Crispy and not over cooked with a nice sauce. My daughter got wings with Honey BBQ and Asian Zing.  I tried the Asian Zing and really loved them. Really good sauce. Not to hot but good.   My wife ordered the Asian Zing salad and we both warned her that it's a little spicy. She ate a little bite and enjoyed it but then it got too spicy for her. We asked the waitress and told her that it was too spicy for her and asked if she a get a chicken salad instead. No issues. The waitress replaced it for no charge. Very cool. The chicken salad was pretty good and not spicy at all.   People were coming in and out the whole time we were there and still coming in after midnight. Very popular place. I enjoyed the meal. Lots of energy in the place.",

    "text": "This is the third or fourth time visiting here and would be the last.  I can NOT take the snippy attitude your waitresses and your hostesses have, seriously do something!  I get it that they may be dealing with kids all day long being in Tempe but you also have grown up customers that don't appreciate a 20 year old talking to them in a snippy way.  I mean what's your deal???   No one is even smiling at this place.  You suck, if I had a zero I would give you a zero :/  Asked for a refill on the water, I got a glass with no ice just warm water and slammed it on the table, I COULD NOT believe it :(  Never felt like a burden before especially when I was spending my money, at this bww they make feel that.  I can also tell there is a click of waitresses hating their life and arguing by the computer/flat screen where they place the orders, they were pointing on tables and arguing, not a pleasant professional way, you made me feel very uncomfortable when you pointed at me!  You know, I was just there to eat late night with a business partner that was it, we were not there to do anything else, you left a bitter taste in our mouth.  This review exclude a gentlemen named Bryant, he was running to get me the water and the beer the waitress forgot and was extremely nice and asked if we needed anything else.",

First it feels a lot smaller than other locations and it smells terrible in there. Like moldy laundry almost. And the menus were disgusting( greasy and still had sauce on it).  The service was slow too, granted it was the super bowl but our server didn't even come until half way through the second quarter. Similar service for people around. The food was luke warm and didn't give us silverware, refill our drinks, or bring us carrot/celery. They guy didn't even seem like he cared. There was like food or something smeared on one of the tvs in our line of sight. I'm not expecting 5 star service,but this was pretty bad. Just avoid this location or go to another sports bar in the area.",

Servers were great. Except the silverware and napkins never arrived.  Food just was lacking this time. Just missing something. We did try the new flavor of wings which is similar to cinnamon apple (angry orchard) and it was pretty good, my husband said epic and I said ok. But in the end not too shabby. The vanilla lager drink was so so. Meh.   Overall a mediocre experience, but I'm kinda biased towards ma and pa places versus chains...Not that they don't have their place",

To be honest, it's only worth it to eat here on Tuesdays or Thursdays because it's *slightly* cheaper. Everything is overpriced from the wings to the burgers. They even charge for celery, carrots and ranch which is actually ridiculous. This wouldn't be a problem if the portions and quality/taste were satisfactory. You have to be very specific with your order (whether you order takeout or dine-in) because they often get details wrong. If you order takeout make sure you open everything up and check if it's all correct. To be fair, all wing places are usually overpriced.",
