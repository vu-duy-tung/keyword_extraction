We sat at the bar and didn't get acknowledged for almost half an hour, they wouldn't even bring the manager over to talk to us. Everyone in my group has worked in the industry and is experienced in great service.",

    "text": "Experienced bad service by JUST THE OWNER at Social Tap. The owner came by twice asking when we were going to leave (clearly trying to rush us out). A minute after the second time, a busser came by and took a friend's food when she wasn't finished. Soon after THE OWNER came by and took her beer which was still half full. We ended up complaining to the owner about the bad service by him and he threw our server under the bus. He called him a bad server in front of us probably three times, and did not take responsibility for the fact that he (the owner) was the one who took the unfinished beer and rushed us out (likely by calling the busser over to clear off our table). What kind of boss does that? I am not just unhappy about the service here by the owner, but about the way that our perfectly fine server was treated by his boss. Won't be back to support this business.",

My colleagues had the ahi tuna sliders, loaded potatoes and tacos and all plates were clean when the server came back by.   Across the table, we had a \"Cadillac\" Social Rita, Coco Fresa and Pinot Noir. For each of us, we only had one drink - that's really hard for a group of gals meeting for happy hour on a Friday after a long week of work!   Overall, everything I've tried food wise is great...but cocktails need to be stepped up!",

We came here as a party of 6 and we couldn't even hear the person sitting directly next to us talking. Our food was delicious and our waiter was very friendly.   A few minutes after we received our food, one of the light fixtures fell from the ceiling onto our table and made a very loud crashing noise. It was only a few inches from hitting my mom on the head. It fell on her plate of food. Not knowing what is was or where it came from (and it was a little frightening) we panicked. The hostess came over to us and asked what happened and we asked to see a manager.   The manager didn't act like it was a big deal which was very frusterating. It could have really injured my mom. They ended up giving us half off of our meal which was very nice, but the music shouldn't be so loud that the light fixtures fall out of the ceiling onto their customers. I understand this is a social setting but turn it down a little please! For the sake of your customers safety!!",

The tacos came with chips and salsa and the salsa was very flavorful, nice and smoky.   My wife got the beef manchego melt, which was the weakest dish. I had a bite.

The atmosphere was really nice. Outdoor patio with heated lamps to keep you warm if your standing outside, nice decor in the inside, and plenty of TV's. Great place to relax with some friends.  I order two fried fish tacos & 1 grilled shrimp tacos ($12). I definitely will try this again. The young man said they get their fish flown in fresh..  I tried 3 separate drinks.. the first one I had to send back - ugh, the other two were okay, I maybe drank half of each one. All three where \"girly fruit drinks\".  Final verdict: I will come back to this place for the atmosphere and food. I'll go ahead and pass on the alcohol drinks and maybe just get a lemonade or something to go with my food.  The drinks were a bust, but the tacos and staff saved the night. Four stars overall..",

I have been to the Social Tap in San Diego but since we were in Scottsdale we thought let's just go so my friends and I came here for fight night.  Well we decided to order fries, and we put in our order and waited a good forty five minutes.  So by this time we figured \"Oh he must have forgotten about our fries so should we just cancel it?\".  We all agreed to cancel the ONE side order of french fries because why would it take forty-five minutes to fry french fries? I have no idea why.  Well as i approached our server he decides to say \"You know what? You're fvked up for cancelling your order.  Like really fvcked up\" in front of our ENTIRE GROUP.  I was applaud because why in the world would you ever talk to a guest like that?  OH MY GOODNESS it gets even better so after we cancel the order we decide to leave and as we are leaving someone grabs me aggressively by my arm and yells \"YOU HAVE A BILL TO PAY\" and I responded \"Excuse me? My I please speak to a manager?\" He goes \" I am the manager\" I am like \"Well lovely, that is no way to treat a guest and I am not paying for a side of french fries that I waited forty-five minutes for and NEVER received them so you can keep your hands off of me!\" Definitely, never coming back to the Scottsdale location.",

For \"bar food,\" they do a decent job.  It's not your typical menu full of fried food.  This weekend, I enjoyed the tuna poke and the Brussels and my friends enjoyed wings and sandwiches.  My poke was okay, the avocado definitely wasn't ripe but it wasn't horrible.  The sauce however is delicious!  The Brussels were great with the balsamic and cheese.  They play good music and always have a great crowd in there.  Service is good but it was a little slow during the fight last night, they also were extremely busy though and the place was packed.  This is a local spot to me that's quick to get to, so I'll be back often.  I would like to try one of their salads next time, and some other items on the menu.",

If you read any review on here negative about this place and NDSU...it's because that NDSU patron was inappropriate and abusive. The host of the NDSU party decided to stick up for a first time idiot. This bar has hosted for 2 1/2 years with no concerns. The bar owner wasn't going to let an asshole tell him what to do....after the bar owner tried to accommodate.  I watched and heard the whole interaction. Keep coming here.!!",

    "text": "I look to Yelp frequently to check out the places I'm heading to, but never do I take the time to write a review once being home. After such a great time this past weekend celebrating the holiday with my friends and family, I decided this place deserves a shout out!  I was so pleased right from the start! The host was cheerful and accommodating and I couldn't wait to get a seat under the cool misters they have. Our server came over quick with a smile on her face and made sure to tell us her name, Taylor, and assured us we were in good hands for our drunken Cinco De Mayo fiesta. She knew everything without question, so to say we were impressed would be an understatement.   We got there just after Brunch had ended (coming back earlier next weekend for sure!!!) so we had to take a little more time to explore their large lunch & dinner menu with lots of different options! I decided on the seared ahi tacos, which our waitress talked us into since I was having a hard time deciding, and they were SO GOOD! I love that you get chips and salsa to munch on as well. My friends got burgers that looked amazing, and they were huge too. We also shared the wings and brussels & bacon app, holy cow those brussel sprouts are delicious.   When I walked inside the restaurant from the patio, I couldn't believe how much bigger it was inside. I'm not into sports much, but this place makes me want to be since their TV's are so great. The bartenders were all busting out drinks and working hard to help two party bikes that just rode in, seems like a lot of work to get people in an out like that, but they did so with smiles!  Overall, I had a great experience this weekend. Just sitting and watching the restaurant work had me feeling really good (the drinks helped too haha). I will be seeing you again this weekend Social Tap, keep running a great spot!  P.S. their building an upstairs roof deck, how cool is that?!? Cant wait to see it",

Nice selection of beers on tap. However the wait at lunch time is rough if you are trying to get in and out in an hour. Can you expect an enjoyable time here? If you're into sportsbars then certainly. If not and you aren't excited by a mostly just ok selection of bar style 'Mexican' food then don't worry about it. Come here for sports and beer, find another place for your meals.",

They just opened in Old Town Scottsdale, and I was excited to try it for the first time today, as I recently moved in to a new apartment complex just down the street.  My roommate and I went over this morning with my 2 dogs, and wanted to sit on the patio and have drinks and lunch.  The hostess first said that they did allow dogs on the patio, but it turns out they only allow them in a small isolated corner of a patio that is on the other side of the building from everything else.  They have a huge covered patio, but the only area they allow dogs is directly in the sun, and it looked very un-inviting.   Keep in mind that the temps today were approaching 100, and they actually were going to put us and the dogs in the direct sun for lunch.  We said thanks, but no thanks, and left to go to Boondocks instead, which has a fantastic dog friendly patio.  I've lived in the neighborhood since November, and almost all of the bars/restaurants in Old Town allow dogs anywhere on the patios.  Social Tap has made a bad business decision on this issue in my opinion.  In a neighborhood that is booming with new residential units, they should be more accommodating to people with and their pets. Very disappointing :(",

We couldn't get another round of drinks and couldn't order food.......she was way too busy.  That's right, it's Black Friday with everyone off of work, and they staff one bartender and one server!  Almost incomprehensible!!  We asked to speak to the manager, and guess what.....the manager is also the bartender!  He was rude and short, with absolutely no idea of what customer service should be.

This place is Terrible. A friend and I went for lunch today. There were a couple tables filled on the patio and four people at the bar, so not very busy.  We were seated at a booth in the bar area. It took 10 minutes for a server to come over.  The bartender stood behind the bar and acknowledged us a couple times but would not come by to help us. Our server dropped off water and we told her we were ready to order.  She said she would come back, but never did. Both of our water glasses she gave us had large chunks of food on them, blatantly obvious, and they were still served to us. It was disgusting. After waiting five more minutes we walked out. Our server watched us get up and leave and did not say anything as she was chatting by the hostess stand. I am really happy with our decision to not order food, based on what we saw, I would not trust the food in there.  Do yourself a favor and choose another restaurant, you will be so happy you did!!",

    "text": "Visited on 6/30/16....what a pleasant surprise! Unlike all of the other old town Scottsdale venues, Social Tap actually has terrific wait staff, prompt, friendly and plenty of them.  The bartenders are knowledgeable about the craft beers they have, they are prompt, attentive and friendly.  I had the pulled pork sliders happy hour special and they were excellent.  I was there as part of a larger group and the wait staff met every one as they arrived, took their orders right away, engaged in conversation with the patrons, the food was not only good, it was prepared quickly...  I cannot tell you how refreshing it was to be somewhere in Scottsdale where everyone at the establishment actually acted like they were glad you were there and cared about their patrons.  Compliments to the entire crew.  This will be my first choice in old town Scottsdale.",

My Moscow mule was expertly crafted and one of the better ones that I've had in the Valley area, my bf and friend also seemed to enjoy their beer flights as well.  The bad: the food was subpar. Between the three of us, we ordered the pork belly tacos, the filet mignon truffle tacos, beef short rib tacos, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, and an order of the truffle fries. The pork belly tacos consisted mostly of tough pork meat with only a little delicious pork belly. The beef short rib taco was dry and lacking flavor, the fish taco appeared to be filled with frozen fish sticks and a bone was found in one. The filet mignon truffle tacos and carnitas were all right, but nothing worth ordering again especially  since we live in one of the best states to find great tacos. The truffle fries were shared between the two guys, and they didn't seem to eat many of them, so I'd guess those weren't winners either.   Conclusion: I wouldn't say that I wouldn't return here, I would return to grab drinks with friend to either watch a game or pre game before going out in old town, but I wouldn't plan on eating a meal here again.",

Our table split the ahi tuna poke (which kept being pronounced \"poke\" instead of \"po-kay\" - just a tip for the staff!), chicken tenders, and grilled shrimp tacos. All were fairly portioned for their price points, but the poke was nothing extraordinary and the salsa accompanying the tacos had no spice/kick at all; it was like water. The watermelon Social Rita tasted like a tangy Jolly Rancher (this is a compliment) and the Skinny Press was delightfully refreshing and perfect for a sunny Scottsdale Saturday. Overall, a pleasant experience, would definitely go back, but for the cocktails and atmosphere, not for the food.",

Waitress blamed it on factors that she couldn't control but that's not a good enough excuse for my experience. Waited over 20 minutes for 1st round of drinks. Waitress spilled a bit of my drink on me and never came back with napkins. Asked for water for the table and only got 2 waters? Waited about 45 minutes for just nachos and tacos. Food was mediocre and not brought out by her but other staff members and I was pretty upset she never came with napkins after I asked and would be common sense if you spill a drink on a customer; this greatly affected my mood. After she dropped the check for $72 and some change, we told her $30 cash first then rest on the card. My card bill came back to $49 and change. Waitress basically stole a seven dollar tip and it wasn't worth the wait to fix it since she had previously taken forever to get back to our table. Dishonest staff and average food. I would urge this establishment to look up our bill and find out who this waitress was. She never even introduced herself by name.",

    "text": "I'm sadly underwhelmed by this place. I come here every weekend for the USC alumni games and despite our great games I always leave unsatisfied with the venue choice. The staff is great, but it seems like the management is not good at anticipating the staffing need.   Last game was during a fight so it was packed and I was ready for subpar service, but an hour and a half to get a drink is completely unacceptable. I ended up getting a free drink, but when you order 3 over the course of the night and 4 come because of a miscommunication between the waitresses that drink should be free.  Their menu is comprehensive and their wine list is great so I was really excited to eat here originally and I haven't been disappointed by the food. Last week I had a Chenin Blanc which was great, but today I ordered a zin that came out cold. Not on the cool side, it was colder than my water (which never get refilled no matter how many times I ask for it to...). The wine was also bitter so I asked if the bottle was just opened, they said it wasn't so that means it has been open for too long and it was probably in the fridge to keep it drinkable longer. It didn't work, guys... I also just swallowed some cork while writing this review. Unfortunately I swallowed it all so there isn't any point in getting a fresh glass especially since the glass is finally approaching room temp.  Bottom line: food is great, service has potential because the staff is great just management doesn't plan appropriately for events, and the drinks are hit or miss. I'll be here every weekend because I have too much team spirit not to be, but I'm just going to be prepared to be disappointed by the venue and hope that my team makes it up to me by keeping our winning streak going so it doesn't ruin my day completely. I wouldn't be a patron if it weren't for the alum events.",

One patio is designated as smoking and the other is non smoking, which is nice that they have them separated.   We came with our baby on a Friday around 5:30pm for Happy Hour...yup, we're THOSE people that bring our baby to a bar  Shoot parents need to have fun too, right? We figure it's still semi-appropriate since it's light out! It was nice we didn't get any judging looks and our daughter was actually a big hit with the other customers sitting at a nearby table. Our waitress was super friendly and even made an effort to socialize with our little girl, which is surprisingly not the case at many restaurants. Music was fun and our 9-month old danced along to Too Legit To Quit and The Humpty Dance in her high chair-- which may have also been why she was a hit   Food was great! Love the bacon brussel sprouts and I'll definitely be back for more very soon. Truffle fries and the dipping sauce were perfect so I ate every last one. Calamari has a sweet and tangy sauce and were pretty good. Wings were cooked to perfection, although I didn't love the sweet chili sauce (my husband did) I'd order a different sauce next time. Lots of happy hour food and drink specials that last till 6pm. My husband got a fruity purple frozen drink that he liked (yup, my 6'2\" man loves him some sweet, fruity drinks - it's actually pretty hilarious to see him sip them down ...I find it manly).   We'll definitely be back soon!",

When I called to make the reservation, they had no problem and said they could definitely accommodate a party of 10 on Sunday morning. When our party got there, they had already given up our table to a different group of people for whatever reason. They managed to find another table for us but because only 8 of us were there right at 10am, with the other 2 on the way, they kicked us out ... this is by far the worst customer service I have ever had at a restaurant. I can definitely say I will not be back to Social Tap ever! Plus the food is not even good",

    "text": "REVIEWER # 50  Social Tap is a great hang out spot in Scottsdale. It's a great relaxed atmosphere with good music and TV's (Playing music videos) located all throughout the bar and outside.    Once I walked in I was greeted right away from the amazing bartender Joe! As we all know AZ can get REALLY hot and I was happy to see that once I sat down I had a nice cold ice water as I was handed a menu for the evening. The food menu at Social Tap is made up of build-your-own salads, burgers, sandwiches, an array of tacos and burritos, rice bowls and entree plates.   After hearing so much about their Ahi Poke I had to give it a try and I am happy I did. The Ahi Poke was delicious! I was able to sit at the bar and people watch on a lovely Saturday night. The bartender (Joe) and I was able to discuss the bar a little bit and I learned that they are recently new to the community and just opened up last year.   DID YOU KNOW: This bar doesn't offer Ciroc but Joe said that it's something that he is looking into.  I have to admit that they have a wonderful alcohol selection and they have great options for beer (I'm not a beer drinker but I'm just saying!)  They had so many options for food that I wish that I had put it on my itinerary and made it my \"to-do\" but instead I came so late that I wasn't able to try as much as much as I wanted to. Next time I come I would want to try their wings. (I may just have to go explore the Ventura location)  They also have a great outdoor dining area which is great for people watching and also bringing your fur babies! Yup, you guessed it! This place is pet friendly! With a large outdoor dining area and bar, enjoy local craft beer in the middle of Old Town. Whether you are having a night out with friends or enjoying a weekend brunch, this place is a must do when in the area.   It's a great food and bar joint. They also have locations in Ventura and San Diego and when I was SD I missed out on this place so I was happy to have the chance to try them in Scottsdale.   REVIEW 76/196",

    "text": "You know it's an intense love affair when you can't keep me away. I stinkin adore this place so much I spent my entire weekend crushing hard on it. It was a lovefest that still lingers on my mind and tastebuds. Old Town is stepping up its foodie game with the grand opening of Social Tap. Amidst all the bars and hodgepodge eateries, I love that you have a classy sports bar with the chill vibe and good energy of a hot spot. Food was consistently good, actually rather amaze balls, so I have to give major kudos to the staff when you can ease through a grand opening with very little kinks. I think they purposely plucked all the eye candy available and hired them to serve to your every whim here. The decor is understated sexy with spacious patio seating, booths made perfectly for canoodling and bar stools that are plush on the bum.   For starters, hands down I love the ahi poke and the sweet chili wings. I will say I prefer my ranch thicker so it sticks on the wings as I suck the life out of it. The chips and salsa with a side of guac, are addictive. The salsa has this hint of chipotle sweetness and spicy. If you want light, order the grilled shrimp tacos. How I managed to eat two after the starters is beyond my friends...what can I say, tiny girl big appetite. However, my eyes locked in on the rib-eye steak. Cooked perfectly how I like it but the only disappointing part was they ran out of mac-n-cheese on the soft opening night. You obviously know where this is leading to - return visit of course. Whether you want to close out weekend or start the week, Sundays have half off bottles of wine. Need I say more? Well actually, they'll tease you on Mondays with free dessert when you purchase two entrees and drinks. Why must you flirt shamelessly with me Social??!!!!   This is a 4-star simply because I want to wait to update my review when the rooftop patio opens up. More importantly, I can't wait til football season!!! Just the right amount of TVs to keep my eyes glued on the games. Hopefully it will remain a neutral bar rather than a designated team spot. As their motto states - Eat. Drink. Be social. In the playground of pretentiousness, Social is a place you can be you. Stop in and pull a chair up next to me because most likely you'll see my happy face grazing on 3000 calories, often and here.",

Any who...I ordered the ahi poke app for lunch and my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki bowl. I really enjoyed my poke but wish it had a few more of the won ton chips as there were not enough to eat the entire thing but I finished it with the fork and was still just as tasty! My boyfriend doesn't eat onions or bell peppers and his bowl was loaded with them so he really only had the rice and teriyaki chicken. He said it was ok but looking forward to trying something else next time we go.  Service was great and everyone was friendly!",

She had what she said was \"the best breakfast burrito I  ever had!\" This was after living in foodie town Austin, Texas for over a decade, where breakfast burritos are as common as cowboys.  She allowed me a bite or two, and the flavors were outstanding.   I had a sweet tooth that morning, so I chose their amazing French toast. It was griddled Texas toast with cinnamon vanilla batter, topped with a perfect blueberry compote surrounded by powdered sugar. I had a side order of extra crispy bacon to balance the sweetness just a bit. This was one of the best plates of French toast I've ever had!   Taylor was our alert, friendly, and efficient server. She made our visit such a pleasure. When we finished we walked from the cool patio inside and met the savvy manager, Cole. We asked him to relay our high compliments to the chef.   Fortunately, we live near Social Tap and will be going back soon. I'm going to get the breakfast burrito next time. Social Tap is relatively new to our neighborhood, and it's a great addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area.   Check it out!",

Our waitress forgot two peoples drink orders so they had to wait another 15 min to get their drink.  After finally getting our drinks, we had to wait until the server took our food order.  The food came out soggy and greasy.  Not to mention she forgot two side dishes.  I will never go back to this place or recommend it.",

Waited a good 15 minutes before they even acknowledged me at the bar.  About 15 minutes after that, the staff started walking around telling all the patrons that if they were staying for the fight it was going to be a $20 cover. I don't recall them advertising the cover charge. But since I was already there  I figured, sure, put it on my tab. The manager said, \"sorrry, cash only. There's an ATM around the corner.\"  That is what makes the difference between pro customer service and amateurs.  So I paid for my one beer and left. Went down the street to Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers, walked right in, no cover to watch the fight, got served at the bar immediately.  Not sure what is going on at Social Tap.  But I will not return. It's a shame because I had a high opinion of this place.",

Not the best place to get coffee but you can get a $15 mimosa bucket and good meal for your group. Prices for food are really reasonable too.

The BLT was just okay, I mean you can make one just as good or better at home, nothing special.  The filet mignon tacos were extremely bland.  We don't think they were seasoned at all.    Bottom line, for a place to have drinks and hang out Social Tap is a great spot!  If your wanting to eat your better off heading somewhere else first and then getting a drink here after.",

Nachos are $8 during HH and you still need to add meat for $4 which isn't discounted. The short rib is usually pretty good here, so I got that on my nachos. The cheese was melted in the oven and overall this was a slightly above average nachos that just needed a few more bucks off for happy hour. Otherwise, the chicken fingers were good and they now have  a YELP check-in for a $2 beer. Way too many flies out in the back patio bar. Fly season is over, so that was annoying - eat inside if possible.",

We tried the calamari (can't beat calamari with chorizo cooked in it), Cali bowl, beef melt sandwich, and Mac and cheese. All were exceptional besides the Mac and cheese. The Mac was a build your own, so admittedly, we chose the ingredients, peppers and chicken. The Mac just didn't have the texture and consistency I expect from restaurant grade Mac. Mac aside, I was so impressed with the calamari, Cali bowl, spicy salsa, homemade salad dressing, and sandwich that I'm excited to go back for tacos and burgers. If they just had a few more tv's I think we could trade in our local sports stop for social tap!",

Social Tap was recommended to us when we could not get reservations at a reasonable time at a nearby restaurant. As we walked up, we were greeted by the sound of twenty-something families, including children, playing games and yelling on the patio. If you are looking for a place to drink beer and be loud with your friends. This is your place. If you want to have a nice conversation over a nice dinner, stay away. I agree with my daughter that the food was bland. I ordered two street tacos one with pork and one with steak. I could not tell the difference by the taste. The only thing saving this evening from being a total disaster was the staff. They seated us in a quiet corner in the back of the restaurant and were very professional as they took care of us.",

Beer was 7 on the menu so no matter how you slice it... overcharged. And couldn't taste a drop of Titos as they were mixed with soda... our mistake for sure.

    "text": "Attended the UA Wildcats athletics event that was held here last night to talk about the strength of the UA athletic program in general and introduce the new football coach Kevin Sumlin.  Our youngest daughter just wrapped up her freshman year at UA and we are members of the Wildcat Club, so my wife and I decided to take the clan to do some mingling with other local UA folks.  The Alumni Association had rented out the entire restaurant for the evening and even though the free food was advertised as \"snacks\", it was actually a lot more than that - buffet style build-your-own tacos, nachos, carnitas, bbq pulled pork sliders, chicken wings, mac&cheese and a salad station.  There was a massive amount of food.  Non alcoholic beverages were also supposed to be provided gratis.  My wife and older daughter had adult beverages while our soon-to-be UA sophomore and I had soda.   The restaurant was packed for the event!   I hit the buffet and made one carnitas taco, a plate of nachos, and grabbed a few grilled chicken wings for our table.  The carnitas was mediocre and fatty, the nacho cheese sauce I poured over the nicely crisped tortilla chips was pretty tasty and obviously of high quality.  I did not try the wings, but both daughters said they were good.     There were a lot of bartenders.  Our oldest daughter paid cash for our first round of drinks which took a painfully long time (one glass wine, one tap beer, one lemonade, one coke, one ice water w lemon).   I paid for our second round of drinks with cash which took almost no time at all (different bartender).   Oldest daughter had one additional beer and she paid cash for that (original bartender, excruciating amount of time for one tap beer).   Despite that, after the event was over, the original bartender suddenly appeared at our booth near the bar and asked me out of the blue what my name was.   Since my family was in the middle of a conversation I was a little bit surprised so I just said \"what?\".  She repeated \"what is your name\".  I told her and then said \"why do you ask?\" to which she replied \"you need to close out your tab\".  I explained that we did not have a tab and had paid cash for our drinks, at which time she simply turned to my daughter and said \"you had a tab though\".  My daughter replied that she did not and had paid cash for her drinks.  Bartender's response was to turn and walk away while saying she swore one of us had a tab.  We were left in silence for a moment before I explained to the family that maybe they had had a few people who though alcohol was free and had perhaps walked out on their tabs and so were just double checking with the remainder of the guests.    I really liked the atmosphere, layout of the restaurant and awesome patio.  The massive amount of food was good for a buffet style function like that and they definitely have a great beer and wine list.  I did not like the one bartender's attitude or the level of service she provided (and after the event I noticed that she had charged us for the non-alcoholic drinks which were supposed to be gratis), but the other bartender was friendly and expedient.    I'll go back again.",

Chilaquiles are normally suppose to have eggs mixed in with the chips. They had all the ingredients separated so it's basically.. tomatoes, alvocado and chips with cheese not really a True chilaquiles. I hate to say this but the poke was the worst I've ever had. The fish wasn't fresh but I am in Arizona. The seasonings wasn't correctly made either.   Service wise: The waitress wasn't happy to be here and it was easy to tell. Maybe she was having a bad day.  Ambience wise: it's more of a bar scene. They have a live DJ and NFL games on a bunch of different tv's which is why I give it a decent review.  Price wise: for the quality. It's not worth the food.   Overall: I'm not from here so I'm probably not gonna come back but if I was I question if I would for the food.. For the ambience, maybe..",

When there is a certain bartender working, she always tells me if they made the ceviche that day or not (side note; if it's on your menu, shouldn't it ALWAYS be available??)...if not I obviously can't order. That chick is awesome.  But there is one stupid lady who ALWAYS puts in my order regardless of if they have it or not. I then make the drive out there to pick it up, only to have her tell me they don't have it available that day. She's done this to me at least 3 times. Today was the last straw. It's 4/16/19 11:55 AM, and she's the only one behind the bar today. The icing on top of the cake is that fact they have shit parking. No matter where you park, someone comes around and sticks orange tow away stickers on your window. There is NO signage saying where to park. I've seen people's cars being towed on MANY occasions as well. At this point it's nothing but a huge joke.  As much as I absolutely love their ceviche, it's not worth the hassle anymore. I just won't be returning.",

Sat down and was not acknowledged by the waitress for about 30 minutes. Went up to the bar to get a drink which was an equal nightmare. Stood there for 15 minutes with a group of guys who also were having a ridiculously hard time getting a drink. Finally see our waitress so go back to my table to order...they had the summer shandy tap on so I asked for that. Waitress comes back with an Oktoberfest made by the same company, says the restaurant hasn't changed the tap handle yet...fine, I take it because I don't want to wait another hour for a drink. Still charges me for the beer even though it was brought to me before I was asked if that was ok, just assumed. I happen to like Oktoberfest anyway but it's more the principle. There were 6 of us and she just brings over one tab, doesn't ask if we want the bill split. Overall terrible, with all the other spots in old town probably won't be back, even though the bar itself is super cute and has a lot of potential.",

And this one will surely be the best of the bunch. Take your appetite for good food, micro brews and a bunch of big screen viewing  inside and outside in really comfortable furniture. Be sure to visit the wine list and try the desserts!! My wife and I will be regulars. 5 stars does not seem like enough!!! Inside has great music and decor but you can enjoy the cool desert breezes on a really well designed patio which is slated to be two story in the near future. We love this American eatery for sure.",

I got a Cobb salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was meh, really bland. The lettuce was wet and therefore couldn't hold any of the dressing. Even the bacon lacked flavor. My boyfriend got the carnitas tacos. Honestly the worst taco I've ever tried. It was sopping wet and dripped all over the plate when you tried to eat it. It was a huge hunk of this colorless meat that was absolutely flavorless.   I hate returning food and I often don't. If I don't like something I usually eat what I can and then never come back. This time, both dishes were so inedible that the waitress noticed we weren't eating and brought the manager over. He was really nice and asked for our feedback since it's a new place. He offered us gift cards to come back and try them again, but then let us know that for whatever reason, he couldn't activate the cards. No big deal. We probably wouldn't have been back anyway.",

But a nice thing to chew while you take a break from eating their monster burgers.  I constantly use ubereats to get delivery straight to my place. They are fast and the food is always warm. It's perfect method when you are craving a delicious burger, but too engaged in t.v to leave.  Also, you can use my code, eats-mbdvx , to get $10 off your next delivery through ubereats.",

The food is fantastic (really, best tacos and happy hour menu in Old Town), the beer selection is amazing, plus they have their own brews, and the staff is nothing short of phenomenal, and it starts from the top and trickles down.  Jean is fantastic, and her bar manager Matt makes it his personal mission to ensure the service is top notch and you enjoy each aspect of your visit.  The bartenders and bar backs (Joe, Jennifer, Stephanie, Marcus, just to name a few...) have awesome energy and are some of the friendliest people, making it that much more enjoyable to come here.  I'd love to comment on the waitstaff, but truth be told, I can't.  But let's be honest, they've got to be top notch as well.  Whether you're looking to catch the game on a weeknight, start your weekend off right, experience the best taco tuesday around, or even just grab a quick bite and a drink, you'd be silly to not at least give this place a shot.  All it took was once and now I'm pretty sure you could call me a regular.",

The 2nd time, I reluctantly returned or a work HH and again the service was far below average. Tonight my husband and I just visited social tap, since the wait was nonexistent. It's now 6:50 on a Friday night. We were seated at the bar for 15 minutes, with 3 bartenders behind the bar none of which acknowledged us. Even a \"hey be with you in a minute\" would be appreciated. It appeared one gentlemen was strictly doing table/server orders. One of the bartenders walked past us multiple times, but didn't care to acknowledge 2 new patrons. We will never be back. tl;dr: service sucks, don't go here.",

The interior is upscale and the good is too. And we are foodies for sure. Should have taken photos of dinner but the thyme chicken on risotto is flavorful each time, the short rib plate is tasty as well and you can't go wrong on any of the tacos.  Give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed. Servers are really nice and on top of it.",

We walked up to the hostess stand and one of the waitresses walked over and sat us inside. The ladies working seemed to not want to be there, but we had a blast.   We were brought waters immediately and then helped with our order. One of the fights were on all of the TVs which was pretty cool to watch.   I would've thought this place would've been more busy especially on a Saturday night but it was still a cool place. The food was great, a little pricey but in line with the area. Our waitress was nice enough and kept bringing us waters since at 10:30pm it was still 110 outside. Would recommend if your in the area, but I don't think this is a place I'd actively choose to come too.",

I will also be recommending to our alumni club that we find another venue that is actually family friendly for day games.  My 11 yr old son was visiting the restroom as we were about to leave, this was about 6:00pm on a Saturday. I could see he was upset when he returned to our table, and he told me someone had told him to \"fkkk off\" in the men's room and shoved him as he walked past them. Like any parent, I was furious and asked to speak to the manager. My son pointed out the offender to the staff, however they just shrugged! The manger was a complete jerk and didn't do anything because he said the guy was a regular customer!  I hope this place goes out of business and I will certainly tell everyone I know to stay far away.  * This incident occurred in Oct of 2018, but I just remembered to write about it when the USC alumni club sent out an invite to watch this season's games there once again. Nope!",

We also order few more items off the social hour menu.   Pork Tocos, chili cheese fries, pork sliders and one their cookie ice cream dish.   Pork tocos were amazing hands down plus they came with a side of chips! Yum!   Pork sliders were also good. The pork was cooked to perfection also could taste each favor profile when you ate pork without the bread.   Cookie dish was also very good. Ours turned out little melted since our server didn't time it out very well with the rest of the dishes. In menu it states the cookie is cooked to order. Hence we ordered it at beginning to in sure it would come out after the apps. It actually came out before the bulk of our apps.   The Chili Fries were just ok. Nothing to special.",

We had arranged to have appetizers ready for us when we arrived and everything was set up to perfection. We were greeted outside and welcomed in, we were shown our table where the appetizers were waiting hot and ready. The service was phenomenal, but phenomenal isn't even a good enough word to describe our bartender Keegan.... i'm not even sure if he was the bartender, or the manager, or if he owned the place because the way he offered us service you would assume it was his business. Thank you for making our night a great night! Make sure you stop by this hidden gem it's definitely a place to check out if your in town!",

I was thrilled to start the season right by hanging out with Giants fanatics on a Sunday morning!  Very cool atmosphere with a huge patio area, as well as with the comforts of the ceiling fans blowing mist for those hot summer days. The service that the servers and the bartenders showed was amazing, especially with the amount of people that were at this special event.  Watching the football game the thirst set in, so I went with a refreshing Mmmmojito! It was brunch time so I went with the \"breakfast sandwich\". The sandwich had an over easy egg topped with two applewood bacon in a hamburger bun. Also came with house potatoes or french fries. We went with both sides. The breakfast sandwich had nice crisp taste that worked perfectly while watching the game. I am looking forward to trying out new things on the menu the next time I pay a visit, which will more than likely be when the Giants are playing. Cheers!",

The music wasn't too loud. I was able to talk to my friends without screaming at the top of my lungs. They have a great happy hour - must try their truffle fries!! The service was outstanding. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a outdoor patio happy hour! There's also ton of free parking around the back of the restaurant.",

First time was for a fight and it was PACKED This didn't keep the bartenders from keeping up with the constant crowd and every single person had a good attitude.  The first time I was here with the hubs and an out of town friend. Really couldn't have been happier that we didn't have to become one of the crowd.  Second time was this past weekend for the Seahawks wildcard game. This time we were a group of 11!!!  Easily accommodated us in the back with our own TV and awesome server and wait staff. They were on the ball with making sure we all were happy customers.    I've had the appetizers but not the FOOD yet. Eventually I will...It definitely looks and smells delicious.   See you soon Social Tap!",

All I know is I usually get scared when I'm in an empty restaurant.  S and I were politely greeted as we walked in. The menu has a lot of great sounding food on it. Unfortunately, sounding good isn't the idea.  S ordered the Beef & Manchego Melt ($14). This sandwich is sliced beef with a mushroom, poblano pepper and shallot mix, Manchego cheese, fried shallots and a horseradish aioli. It's all piled on a toasted ciabatta bun and served with Au Jus. S said the sandwich was good but nothing special.  I ordered the Turkey & Havarti Melt ($13). This sandwich is sliced roasted Turkey with fried shallots, mixed greens, sliced Tomato, Mustard aioli and Bacon Jam. The Turkey was a tad dry which the mustard aioli helped with a bit. The Bacon Jam was a miss. It added a funky taste which didn't meld well with the mustard aioli and melted Havarti. The kitchen team needs to rethink this one. Both sandwiches came with salt & black pepper fries. They were decent, nothing special.  Overall, I think the prices are high for portion size. I realize we're in Scottsdale, but maybe that's why the place was empty for a Friday lunch.  Average Service. Average Food. High Prices. 3 Stars.",

    "text": "I have to start out with I loved the Social Tap in the past! Good people and good food. Unfortunately they have changed. They served good house spirits and wine but then started to change it weekly to less desirable brands. The house wines were bitter. Their chicken wings were very good, the best around the area. It seemed they have changed cooks and the last two times they have been under cooked.  The first time we took the wings home and re-cooked them ourselves accepting that the night we were there the restaurant was very busy.  The second time the restaurant was pretty empty so there was no excuse for them to be under cooked again.  We are in downtown Scottsdale often so we drive by this business and find it empty of customers most of the time. This is sad because it was a great place in the past.",

I spoke with a manager, Dave I believe who said come in next time and he will give me a discount etc, but I am not really sure I'd want to try it again. Just beware if you order something through a delivery service you're rolling the dice so if you do want it I would go in person ! I ordered a fish taco sauteed and got fried fish, I ordered a bowl of soup, got a cup of cold tasteless soup missing the promised tortillas and avocados, looked like something out of a frozen bag and tasted like it too. Ordered a side of chips and salsa and received the salsa only. Orders a sandwich where the bread was cooked on one side, doughy wet and soggy on the other same for fries.

We sat in the patio which was pretty nice but the we had to go in and ask for someone to wait on us and get us some drinks.  After the waitress got our drinks, my wife didn't like her glass of wine so I brought it to our server's attention.  Instead of say \"let me take that one back and get you something different\", she let it sit there even after my wife ordered a different wine.  We ordered the chips/salsa/guacamole, seared Ahi tuna and the brussel sprouts.  The sprouts didn't come out with the other two appetizers and the server said they had to cut more so it will be a few.  When they finally came out, they were still a bit crunchy hard but the flavor was good.  As for the guacamole, not impressed at all. Didn't have any flavor and the salsa was average.  The Ahi was decent.  We ordered our entrees and I had the shrimp and fish tacos.  The grilled shrimp were more like sauteed shrimp but undercooked.  The ceviche was horrible and tasted like vinegar.  My wife also had the shrimp taco and she said the same thing but also added \"I bet we leave here with food poisoning\".  That didn't happen but it was very disappointing since the pictures of the food looked so good online.  With a bill that was over $100 even after a glass of wine was taken off, we left there less than thrilled.  Sorry Social Tap, we won't be back.  Reminder folks:  this is a sports bar and not a \"restaurant\" even though they serve food.",

Waitress said that, \" We don't have that meanie that this location\" despite it having Scottsdale listed on the menu. Not an acceptable answer  We ordered and ate good food. Got the bill and my meal was still listed. Asked her to take it off and she said, \"it was only for brunch.\"    Do not appreciate dishonest businesses even if the food is good. I will tell everyone about my bad experience.",

We ordered a few appetizers like the calamari, brussel sprouts, buffalo chicken sliders, and pulled pork sliders. They were delicious and had an modern flair to them. I tried two of their cocktails and really enjoyed the Skinny Press.   The whole restaurant is really cool. It would be a great place to watch a football game (if I was into that) or bring a large group. They also have plans to open a sweet rooftop deck.  My only small comment is the lack of parking. They only have three assigned parking spaces so you just have to find a place to park in the area or walk a few blocks from a parking garage. I would highly recommend trying out this place! I will be back to test out the full menu and more drinks!",

We ordered the Trifecta Wings, in sweet chili and Jamaican jerk, as an appetizer. The sweet chili is better, but overall the wings were good! Then we ordered a bunch of tacos. The Filet Mignon truffle tacos and the carnitas tacos are the best. I would recommend this place!",

The restaurant wasn't even half full of patrons, I'd hate to see a full and busy night! Better yet when my 88 year old grandfather asked if there was cheese on his sandwhich, she looked at him and pointed to his sandwhich saying... \"there is cheese on there\". Extremely rude!

But this place was trying way too hard. They have beers from other places but none of them were that interesting. I'd hit Craft 64 instead if you're looking for a variety.",

    "text": "Omg this place rocks! Our food was out of this world delicious. I had the beef dip, and what a tantalizing spin on a hearty classic. The poblano chile and mushroom topper with crispy shallots provided a beautiful experience for my palate and the horseradish aioli really made this classic shine! The grilled fish tacos were cooked to perfection and nice n light and fresh for a sunny day.  Jessica provided excellent, attentive service with great recommendations for dishes and exuded extensive knowledge of the menu and how things are executed. They are dog friendly too! The re model from the stinky frat  firehouse that it used to be is absolutely gorgeous. The best part about it all? $39 bux for an appetizer, two full entrees with a special addition, and two drinks. My wallet was very happy. The vibe was really fun too, everyone was in a great mood, strangers were chatting with each other, great place to mingle if you're single! I'll definitely be back!",

I started with the wings...best I've ever had! I'm a short rib connoisseur so I had to try theirs with Parmesan grits...to die for! Melted in my mouth! Too full for dessert but they looked amazing so I'll save up next time. Finished the night off sitting at the indoor/outdoor patio bar...best seat in the house! Definitely my new spot!",

    "text": "Great potential with the location and building structure, however, something's just not clicking.  Asked the server if there were any drink specials and she said \"no\".  Looked through the brunch menu and there were several drink specials: bloody marys, $15 bottles of champagne, etc. Ordered the Chicken and Waffles which are quite good but the menu states \"chicken thigh meat\" and I have now gotten white meat twice. The first time I asked about the white meat substitution, they said they ran out, used white meat instead and that nobody had noticed before.  Went there today and got white meat again. Asked the server to check with the manager and he said they always use thigh meat, when I'm staring at a plate of breast meat and she acknowledged that it was white meat, as well.  Manager would never come over.  Maybe they just don't want to change the menu and simply practice avoidance. Again, it was good but really do love thigh meat if I can get it.",

    "text": "I would not return to this restaurant. Starting from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with disorganization and indifference for customer service. After we placed our name on the wait list and waited 45 min, we checked in with the hostess to see where we were on the list. The response was \"oh I forgot about you and we've had open tables, you'll be next\". We then asked a group of men to join them at a community table and we were told they needed the open seats across the table from them so they could see the game. Another 30 min passes and I ask the hostess again and she forgot a second time! When I asked for the manager, she said she was the manager!! Needless to say, she wasn't. The real manager came out and offered to buy us a round of drinks. We finally joined the end of a community table and we're served plates with old gum stuck to them! The only good thing about this experience was a server named Ashley who went above and beyond to find us a table, and continued to check on us to make sure we had a nice meal! The manager never came back to check on us and didn't seem to care about how the rest of our experience was. Finally, 1 out of our 4 meals was forgotten. So everyone's food got cold while we waited for our last dish to be made. The manager,Cole came out only when requested and didn't seem phased at all.",
