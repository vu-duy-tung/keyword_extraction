A couple of us had the Prime Rib (because we heard good things about it), but it was the worst piece of meat I've ever had.  Tough & way too fatty.  Ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well.  One person in our party had the chicken salad and the lettuce was really.  We actually wanted to eat on the nice large patio, but the place is over run with smokers.  Probably a great place to grab a couple of beers, have some oysters and then wrap it all up with a few smokes, but for anything else, I'd pass.",

He left them a a very nice tip  yet the half wit bouncers threw out this nice man with heavy force, He was from out of town and did not know the way out.  It was very sad.  This older man was trying to leave yet this STUPID non educated bouncer worked to throw out this man and tried to get the older man to engage in some sort or fight.  He was smarter than the HALF WITS that this BAD bar has on hands for bouncers.  I am also out of town and hope that anyone that looks here at Yelp knows that that this is a bad bar to go to.  I also understand that other company personal go to this bar ... shameful.  There is a reason that this bar/restaurant is  rated so low ... it is because of the thugs that they think is necessary ... not for an older guy ... this bar/restaurant is on the SUCK list and I hope that everyone sees this post. Please refrain from this local bar.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I have only ever enjoyed Casey Moore's as a bar and have never had the food, though I hear it is good.  The bar is nice, right off of Mill Ave/University but a bit tucked away from the Mill crowd.  You will definitely get a unique people watching experience, as the crowd is diverse from college co-eds, to hipsters to punk...you get my point.  The alcohol selection is great, my fave being Ace Pear Cider, they also have Stella Artois, which I have found to be quite difficult to find on tap in other locations.  Added bonus, men get to use the \"stone\" outside restroom, where you pee, well on a stone outside. Kinda jealous considering there is always a wait for the 2 stall women's bathroom.  This place is always crowded, on this occasion I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed.  Service is always good and friendly, though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long.  It beats going up to the bar inside though, as that wait is usually just as long.  The parking is a mess, as the lot is small and well, it's always crowded.  Be wary of parking in nearby apartments, as your car will be towed.",

No scooping the oyster down right from the shell. Bloody Mary's are good. As I said more of a bar for drinks than a restaurant for food.",

I'm sitting in a booth and enjoying my first visit to Casey's when a drunk guy decided to lean against one of those outdoor gas heaters and almost knocked it over on me.  I think I yelled \"oh my God\" in horror as it tipped over in my direction, but thankfully it was more like one of those Weebles preschool toys.  You know, Weebles wobble but they don't fall down.  Then he actually tried to lean against it again!  After a few awkward moments, he finally realized what a horrible idea that was and moved on.  It reminds me of the time I saw a waiter try to put some candles out at the end of the night.  He kept using his fingers to extinguish the flame and kept getting burned, over and over again until he realized that he could just blow it out.  Why are some people so stupid?   I loved the idea of Casey's.  The patio is awesome.  The food is basic.  I ordered the seafood sandwich and the waitress said they used imitation crab meat.  Not a big deal for me but I know a lot of people hate it.  Something I didn't know is that the process of making imitation crab was developed in Japan over 800 years ago... or so I read.  What the hell, did I just make this review useful?!   Anyway, great place to grab drinks.  Just avoid jerks who use gas heaters to steady themselves.",

There is always an atmosphere at an Irish pub that cannot really be explained - and this place is no exception.  Yes, I tried their oysters, and they're tasty.

The oysters on the half shell were exceptional, especially with the house-made fresh (and potent!) horseradish. Kinda wakes up your sinuses and makes you say \"Boy... Howdy!\" This is Japanese wasabi's American cousin driving a monster truck through your uvula!  However, there were some misses with the food on the rest of our order. The chipotle hot wings were way too subdued, although the texture was decent. I was hoping for a spicy wing that would grab me by the gooch--alas, these did not. The fried mushrooms were a tragedy. Crispy and breaded on the outside, but when you bit into them they turned to mush.  I'd come back for the beer, the interesting crowd, the great outdoor patio or rustic bar interior. I'm advising you order carefully though. Maybe their sandwiches are the big draw (besides the face-smacking, face-hugging oysters).",

My friend said,\" I gave you my credit card\".  She said well , i don't have it.  This went on and on for quite some time with the waitress and some man who may of been the manager. They kept telling my friend that he did not give the card to them. He ended up just paying cash and had to cancel his credit card.  Well 2 hours later guess what??? They called to say they DID find his card and he could come back and get it.  What did they do to remedy their mistake???? Gave him a card for 2 drinks next time. Believe me , there is no Next time.                              Customer service does not exist here.

I've gone in to Casey's and attempted to meet new people; been looked at like a crazy and also have met some cool ones as well. It's location is close to many things in Tempe, which makes it a favorite spot for bike riders. Ride your favorite two-wheeled friend down there and strike up a convo with other enthusiasts, because a bike friendly world is a happy world.   I've never really had any problems with the staff, minus pouring me too stiff of drinks(their Irish coffee especially). It does tend to get extremely crowded nights on the weekends which can lead to slower service but that's what good company is for. Head inside to the bar, grab your first round, find a seat out on their wonderful patio and wait for your waiter for the next round. simple.   I don't really dig their food too much. I feel they dress it up saying it's an \"oyster house\" but really its just bar food. I tend to eat at home or somewhere else and just have this as a drinking joint. Otherwise I feel greasy and gross afterwards. I will say their portions are good enough to share.",

So the bar tenders where very nice and poured 20 Applesauce shoots...they ring a bell he makes a very eloquent speech....about his friend Steve.......we all drink up...  Then as the bar filters out this girl comes in up to him and in a big cheery voice...  \"hey are you Steve? I here Ur buying drinks!\"  the cround went silent and let out a huge gasp of air...  Now I imagine right after your Friend commted suicide your pretty much on the edge....I almost assumed he was going to start crying....or yell at her....or even just walk away.....But instead he was very cool about it....  \"I'm buying drinks, in honor of my Friend Steve who committed suicide.\"  I was impressed by his demeanor and the fact that he didn't hide from the facts....  I was also impressed with the service at Casey's...they could have cruelly taken advantage of his situation here (there's a story about a drunken NYC firefighter on the anniversary of 911 here....but that's later)  they took care of him very well, and made sure he was safe....

Decor Irish pub with the largest Patio you have ever seen I was trying to meet someone here it took me several rounds untill I looked in every nook and crany...I think the servis is slow just because the place is that big....the Fountain bathroom is not a selling point for me. the inside is quite nice...  so all combined really slow servis, the Peeing fountain, and the $10 credit card limit I'm going to knock a star off. but its certainly a place id go back to.",

    "text": "Sorry to everyone who loves this place, but you have not eaten there or your palate is better served at McD's.  It was even recommended by the front desk at The Buttes as a good place to eat.  First off I am 49, but no stick in the mud. I like energy and fun, but if they say good food it should be better than Denny's. I write to save another business traveler the trouble of a horrible dining experience. This place is BAR....get it...A BAR. It is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer. That is the best thing I had all night. $3.50 for Black and tan pints....although a little light on the black. I started with Oysters...Oyster House, right? 6 oysters. 2 of them bad from looking at them. Advice to kitchen, if they look translucent and milky, they are BAD. They look bad, they will taste worse. All of them shucked poorly with plenty of shell inside. Didn't expect super fresh in the desert, but didn't expect rotten either. Had a salad. Not bad but lettuce was wilted....I guess expected in the 103 desert heat. I did eat inside, as the smokers and shitty misters outside made that option for the redneck hipsters that frequent this place. Had the special as a main course. Teriyaki sea bass. Like something a 6th grader would make!! Horrible!! Swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store. Rice-a-roni, that was overcooked to the point of sticky glop. Side of steamed veggies....best thing on the plate...or the garnish, might have been. College kids, or 30 something redneck hipsters, or local drunks. Enjoy this place. It was made for you. Everyone else stay FAR, FAR away. There are options in Phoenix....I hope. I guess I could be in culinary hell here. After all they still smoke everywhere in this lovely spot in the western desert.",

    "text": "Good because it's local, and you can sit outside and smoke. However, it is also highly, highly overrated. There is nothing special about the food or beer selection, and the parking situation is almost always horrid despite a large private lot.  Worst of all, it is usually peopled by soft, pudgy ASU kids. It's the kind of place sophmores and juniors go to, saying, \"wow! This is so college! I am so in college now! Look how college I am! I'm going to flip my baseball cap around and put on some flip flops!\"  For a real hole-in-the-wall, find a hole-in-the-wall. Casey Moore's is a place that was a hole-in-the-wall and is now firmly ASU establishment - a good place to network with the future VPs of Dupont.",

To eat: The food is ok, but I would never bring out-of-town guests here for dinner to impress. Would definitely recommend coming here after dinner or for a nice, fried drunken snack. To drink: The beer selection is decent, the wine isn't awesome but cheap, and the rest will get the job done if you are willing to wait at the bar.  Really, I come here for the scene. It's busy - lots of different people walking around. You can mingle with strangers or have a private conversation amidst the busy, drunken, smoky scene. Sitting outside makes it the great bar that it is, especially with the heaters on during the colder months. The waitstaff is super chill, considering the kind of banter and shenanigans they have to deal with. Overall, this is one of the cooler bars in Tempe and I'd go here over any Mill bar any day.",

Casey's offers inside dining and a bar - but the expansive patio is the hang-out spot. The clientele is varied and full of regulars. People from all ages and backgrounds hang out here but it's especially popular with ASU students, staff and faculty.   The only downside is parking can be difficult, service sometimes slow and it can become fairly crowded - especially on the weekend.",

The bar tender didn't ID me since I had been in since lunch; I got trashed and ended up following strangers to a party across the street where I passed out on a checker board.   The bathrooms are notoriously crowded--desperate, I went into the men's bathroom, (I'm a girl), where I  shared a stall with some chick I didn't know--that was my second time to Casey's, but my first being hit on in a men's restroom. Also that night, a woman drunk to the point of crazed intensity, urinated herself and stumbled out onto the patio where--wet and googly eyed--she was accepted by the drunken and peaceful patrons.   My third time to Casey's, I fell in love. Right there, under the Palm Tree whose white lights shine year round.   My last time to Casey's,  a little over two years after we drank and laughed ourselves absolutely love sick under the night sky on the casually mooded patio,  even the chill Casey's vibe couldn't take away the uneasy chills and deep pitted anxiety of lost love.   The drinks are strong, the patio's dreamy, the inside smells like beer rot, and Casey's usually leads to good conversation and an adventure.",

I had the hunch that 90-95% of the people there are students (or in that age range) and wondered if a conversation were to be ignited, would it go anywhere?   Casey's is too smokey, too. But, if you avoid it Thursday - Saturday, it's a cool place to go in the early afternoon. My best friend and I chilled out here one sunny afternoon. It was very relaxing. Yet, I soon saw that even at 5 p.m., the place starts to fill up quickly. So, if you don't mind noise and you like commotion, this is a sure bet. Also, if you like Guinness, Ace's or the mix of the two (yum), you'll get your fix.",

You see, if I go once, I'll likely have such a good time that I'll want to go again tomorrow.  This cycle will continue and, being a person who thrives on variety, I'll totally get sick of the patio, the (always interesting) crowds, and the food.  I don't want that to happen, so I'll just ration my visits out accordingly.  Casey Moore's is a college bar in the best sense of the term.

The oysters are always really fresh; the drinks are strong (though the Bloody Marys have a weird taste to them... not sure what that's about) and everything non-oyster I've gotten has been good too. Happy Hour is great; half a dozen oysters for $7!  The whole place is a cool atmosphere to hang out with a friend and get toasted. I like that it's always reasonably busy, even at 10 pm on a Sunday (so I don't feel awkward being one of 3 tables in an empty restaurant, and the vibe stays upbeat) but not so busy you can't get a server to take notice of you.  The inside is dark & cool and feels like an old bar in somewhere like Boston. The patio is dog-friendly, with tons of foliage & shade, and misters.  The only negative is some of the staff seem to have attitudes.  - The door guy arbitrarily cards people; he'll let 5 frat dudes of questionable age in no problemo, but then makes me (at 26) dig out my ID & then scrutinizes it heavily.  - The last 2 waitresses on the patio have turned their nose up when I ordered a water first while deciding on liquor/food & waiting for someone... then they disappeared for 15 minutes. Their attitudes magically change when you order a bunch of cocktails & food... Gosh, I wonder why.",

The outside is very casual and lots of drinkers and smokers. But looks like a fun place to hang out. There are lots of family people also riding their bike there with kids to eat. U can park your bike right out front! =) Its very close to ASU. And I would definitely come back for the food and some drinks. Also seems to have a lot of locals and college students as customers. Very casual and a fun place!",

Waited 20 minutes or more after I was done to get the check. The server just disappeared!",

Whenever I come by myself I have to sit and wait and wait and wait. I don't get served until I start obviously looking around for a server and even then I'm sitting and waiting ten plus minutes to get a drink. Fast forward to an empty glass and not getting checked on once and watching my ice melt to someone FINALLY coming by. I tell them my drink order and they run off before I can order food. By the time my drink gets here (which is placed down and then they run off again) I decide I'm not gonna eat because I don't feel like waiting forever. So I guess pro tip if you want to eat/drink here and get service, come with someone who knows the employees otherwise good luck getting noticed.",

My best friend came here on her last trip to Phoenix and it was on her \"'must visit again\" list. We got an order of raw oysters, potato skins, and fried pickles. The Potato skins were not good, but the other two apps were delicious! The horseradish with the oysters was so fresh, spicy, and ridiculously impressive. Service was great. Our waters were always full and the bloody Mary I had was very tasty! Definitely worth stopping by!!",

    "text": "This review is long overdue.  My husband and I have lived in Tempe for almost 10 years and finally made it to Casey Moore's after some friends simply could NOT believe we've never been there before.  So we decided to make a stop after an afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum for some Bloody Mary hangover healing on Valentines Day 2015.  I was expecting the usual Mill Ave college crowd mixed together with hipsters, hippies, and pseudo intellectuals and I was not disappointed.  We found a seat at a sticky, dirty table next to the little fish pond and had a lovely time watching the birds fight over forlorn french fries strewn under empty tables.  I am over the people watching.  If you're in Tempe, that means you're looking at half dressed 21 year old coeds, or taking shots every time you see some dude with a koi fish sleeve tattoo.  Sorry for the snark, I am SOOOOO tired of the lookalikes on Mill.  Maybe I'm getting too old for this, but seriously....  I digress.  As many others have stated, you come here for the atmosphere and the above average bar food and drinks.  We waited and waited and waited for someone to come take our drink order before my husband finally went to the bar and ordered our drinks.  I would have asked him to order additional drinks had I known how slow the service was going to be - and it wasn't even busy!  Our Bloody Marys came out fairly quickly once we ordered them, and I ordered fried oysters.  The waiter brought out the other kind.  The slippery, boogery, still stuck to it's crusty shell kind.  I was a good sport and ate two.  My husband finished off the rest.    I will add that sometime that weekend we conceived our son, so maybe I should throw an extra star their way because we often joke the oysters and Bloody Marys are what did it.  My husband happens to really like this place, so I suppose I should throw in an additional star.  But this is my review, not his, so two it is.  One for the food and one for the atmosphere.  The others they could earn by improving service and running a Clorox wipe over the tables.",

It's better than the rest of the Mill Scene (no cover, ever!) and is a pretty large establishment. No crappy club music playing all over the place, and the entire outside is a smoking patio.  Recommendations: -Fish N Chips -Baked Oysters (it is an oyster house after all) -Beer specials  -Their burgers and fries are very very good.  Don't recommend: -Calamari (it has this super heavy breading and it tastes more like an onion ring than a seafood product) -Cold oysters on a place -- not as fresh as I'd like them, and a little grainy.",

You pay a premium for the ambiance and the aged beef. To be honest, the food is far better at Casey Moore's. I don't remember the wine choice but the retail of both wines were around the same. Just more than twice the price per glass.",

    "text": "Now overall this is great place to come to eat and I've been here twice so far. The set up for restaurant is great especially for az. Their outside area is cool even during the summer time , they have set an environment with lots of shade and lots of mist . the bathrooms are actually pretty islander style cool at least on the male side. Anyways you get my point it has great  atmosphere. The food is really good also, I have had the Greek sandwich and the fish chips both were great. They also have great healthy choice selection it is really great actually . there are alot of things on menu where you might want to try everything at some point . but my only issue has been every time I've come, I've gotten very weak service. Waiting on to order drinks, waiting for waiter for water, asking for napkins.  Now I don't know how busy it was but on waiter ran pass us like 5 times before getting back to us and it seem he was waiting inside and out. Now I hate to mark place on service but we literally had to remind our guy that we ordered drinks and the check out, man o man. We evenually had to ask another server if they could get our bill for us. Now they could of short staffed both times maybe but I wanted till my second visit to review this place and o like the place and food so much that I potentially would go back but the service just kills me.  Funny thing , there was couple across from my group which also was just waiting and the woman's face was a portrait of patience and polite behavior clashing . didn't want to complain but was losing the battle. Matter of fact the guy that brought our check just notice the couple and they were there before us.",

He was very abrasive and acted like we were inconveniencing him the little time we DID see him.  He shouldn't be in the business, that is for sure.  Maybe he needs to get a job at Dick's Last Resort with that attitude.  Once we deliberately closed out and changed servers, it felt like 3 stars instead of the 1 I was originally going to leave.",

Being in town for work I sometimes eat alone and sit at the bar...the real mark of a top notch establishment is a good bar staff. This place has it for sure. They were quick to get drinks, got my food orders spot on, and were fun to talk to. It was especially hilarious when some foreign students came in (I believe french) and began to hit on one of the regulars. Considering how drunk they already were they got cut off after one drink...and of course left shortly after.   The restaurant is a bit off on a side street in what looks like a converted over house...so it has a very relaxed and cozy feel. They also have a huge outdoor patio area. On top of the amazing oysters I had I also had a tuna melt sandwich. It was very good, but was open faced...I expected two slices of bread to make it into a full sandwich. Not a big deal but a little odd.",

There were about 15 beers on draft, another 25 or so in bottle/can.  The food menu is extensive featuring (as respected by the name) a lot of seafood options.  The oysters on half-shell are excellent (be advise that the cocktail sauce does not need the additional horseradish the provide unless you have not tastebuds at all).  The fish and chips is very good.  We have also tried the tuna stuffed tomato, burger, etc......  Parking can be a little difficult, but it is worth the try.",

I was with a large group of 10 people and we ordered some beers and food (coming to an \"oyster house\" and being told they don't recommend them on the half shell) and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong! I couldn't believe my ears! When I politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left. I was beside myself. I have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night. Yeah I believe that. So we promptly left and were NEVER not once offered one single apology, instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored. Will never set foot in this establishment again and I hope to speak with the owner to let him/her know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant.",

We also had an order of the fried mushrooms (skip 'em - too much breading) and we enjoyed the hot wings so much we ordered a second round of those. Man, the hot wing sauce is good... and the wings are of good quality. I didn't find a fatty one in the bunch.

I went the other night just for some appetizers and drinks, and though the food was decent (fried zucchini and mushrooms), the parking lot, service, music, and crowd sucked. Parking is a bitch if you're gonna try parking in the lot.  I'd just skip it and try to find some parking on the side streets.    Before my group of friends got there, two other guys in our group were at a table, and apparently, the moody waitress (brunette with her hair in a ponytail) kept trying to get them to leave.  Maybe she thought more people weren't going to show, but still...wait a few minutes, you know?  Then, when the rest of the group got there, we asked for menus, and she comes and literally threw them on the table without saying anything to us.  When she returned to the table, she only took drink orders and didn't ask us about food.  Before we could even say anything, she had left.  When she returned with drinks, I asked if there was a drink menu I could look at since I hadn't made up my mind about what I wanted yet, and without even looking at me, she just shook her head and started rattling off ALL the drinks in the bar in one breath, which wasn't really what I was asking for.  And once again, what about the freakin' food?!  Only when she returned a third time did she finally ask us about food.  Then, later on in the evening, she started to clear off the centerpieces even before we were done because, apparently, somebody wanted to get a head start on cleaning up so she could go home early.  Well, Moody Waitress DID end up leaving, but without telling us, so when a different waiter came to finish up our table, we were all a bit confused.    Meanwhile, my friends and I couldn't help but discuss the horrible music that was playing.  And the crowd there was...interesting.  I'm not sure how to describe them.  Go and see for yourself.  Or better yet...don't.  There are better places to go in the area.  Don't waste your time here.",

Thank you for getting rid of the terrible horse shoe area to lay brick over that useless sand pit.  3. Please tell your bouncers that I appreciate their taking into account that one third of my income is spent on you every month when not kicking me out for getting too drunk on my birthday; they're always friendly and not only remember my name but don't mind chit-chatting while I wait for friends (along those lines I apologize for carelessly smashing your glasses while hopped up on booze and birthday glory- it was unnecessary and certainly out of line). 4. I know I tease you about your 'hot dog lights,' but during the cold winter months the red heat keeps me nice and warm and I don't miss any of the crowd watching on the patio- which happens to be the only place I can run into colleagues from work, past ASU professors, old friends, current friends, soon-to-be friends, old high school class mates, all in a matter of 20 minutes. 5. Please tell the fish in your lovely pond that I am sorry for \"feeding\" them beer all those times. Please also tell them I apologize in advance for doing it again this weekend. 6. Please tell your bar staff that I appreciate that they don't make fun of me or charge me some absurb fee for forgetting to close my tab when I stumble out at 2 a.m., and that happens a lot, so I really must congratulate them on their patience and keeping vigil over my precious beer charge card.  That is all for now. Till I write again... Sincerely, Your biggest fan",

    "text": "First impression:   I read so much about Casey Moore's on Yelp that I asked my bro about it, so we headed over there this past weekend night. I couldn't believe how HUGE it was! Or how I didn't know about it on my previous visits to Buffalo Exchange and the general college area-us East Coasters aren't used to parking lots I guess...? But anyway, the bouncers were nice, and I couldn't believe how much we kept walking around outside. There were all kinds of seating arrangements to bascially accomidate any kind of group-from tables with umbrellas, to benches, to regular four person tables, to chairs arranged in a circle to even ladies lounging on these kind of upraised curb thingies, I was impressed with the variety. I felt I had stumbled onto a crazy backyard house party! The crowd was def. younger, but the huge groups of guys were polite when they bumped against you (your clue that this place is PACKED). Although there was tons of seating, there still weren't really any seats. We went in for the beers, but I saw another secret door at the bar and two guys walk in so my bar scene spidey sense went off and behold-two chairs at a table open! I gestured to my bro and snagged it, and lit up a horrible vice and people watched on the porch. It is def. a scene here, but it is pretty relaxed-I def. agree with that. He got me a guiness, which was fine (one gets spoiled by the countless irish pubs in Boston), and then the porch filled up. It is a little difficult to catch bartenders attention since the bar can go three people deep wanting drinks! I want to try the food, but the prices are def. steeper than I am used to...so I will have to let go of my east coast cheap oysters, I guess! But still looking forward to frequenting here repeatedly, trying the food and brining my out of state friends here to relax.  6,730th Impression:  One cannot have \"just a beer, I guess, couldn't hurt\" at Casey Moore's. This has become such a main stay in my life, as it does everyone else that loves it. Where else can you feel relaxed reading a book with a beer, running into your boss or cruising around all hot and sauced lookin' for hotties to seduce with slurred dictation? You can even bring your MOM here in the afternoons and eat their delish avocado and shrimp salad (may be one of the most perfect salads on earth). It really does feel like a permenant house party where you can strike up a conversation with anyone. I have to admit that on St. Pattys day I came here and shamefully peed on the Blarney Stone while guys stood guarded-it was like a rite of passage. Oh Caseys...I might even visit you tonight!",

YELP delivers once again!!  Good beer selection and the rest of the menu looked enticing. This would definitely be a great place to hang with friends; particularly if you find yourself with a hankering for Oysters in the desert.  I have now been inside!! Argh me maties, this here dark multi roomed bar be very cool for swabies and even for yee swankies.

Located just off the infamous Mill-row (skid row's young middle class nephew), at the entrance of a beautiful neighborhood and next door to probably one of the best \"coffee purest\" coffeehouse Cartel. Casey Moore's is converted from a HUGE, \"haunted\" house and they did it right!   Outside has a bar with SO MUCH patio seating and ponds with fish. Inside is a little confusing but has an amazing vibe, also the rumor is the upstairs is haunted, check the plaques by the restrooms!  The drinks are reasonably priced - beer and liquor alike, the food is way above par for bar food, I recommend the Fried Zuccini, personally. Bring a group of friends, come alone, either way I bet you'll strike up a conversation with someone chill in the plethora of unique people & artists who frequent this place. If you have friends from high school or college visiting and you dig the feel of dive bars but want to take your people to a ave that will impress them without wearing out your guy's wallets... CASEY MOORE'S IS THE PLACE!   Great for dates too",

It's been around since '83.  I enjoyed the oyster Po' Boy for lunch and on the return trip, we grazed on appetizers. The rest of the menu looks great, but this is an oyster house! The clams strips, oysters on the half shell and the escargot were all amazing. The last place I went to which offered the variety available here was a lot more expensive and not exactly casual.  Plus, it was a gorgeous evening on the patio with great service and atmosphere. And how many places are so chill that a couple of strangers from Norway will ask to share your table and it feels normal? Good conversation with some cool snowbirds may not be your typical experience, but it made ours even better!",

It had spinach, bacon bits and some sort of cheese sauce. All baked so it gives it that extra flavor profile all together.  I also got a corned beef sandwich on rye. Nice thick slices of corned beef, but I got over it after half the sandwich. I'd probably get something else if I were to do a sandwich.

It's the perfect place to sit in a group of friends after a long day at work and just decompress. Casey's offers an energy many bars cannot match, the variety of ages and voices here is beautiful. A huge part of that enjoyment is the staff here. From top to bottom, the staff here is perfectly curated to make sure you are having fun and safe. From the bouncers to runners to bartenders and servers, this is truly the reason my friends and myself come here.  I would like to give a special bit of love to Tyler, Heidi, Marcus, Dave, Derek, and Ian. All of whom have taken my safety as a woman here very seriously and always been helpful in any situation with a difficult weekend crowd.  The atmosphere is great, the bar food is above par, and well I think you understand my favorite part. The one qualm can be the run-off guests from Mill, and it can get rowdy and some guests can be a little agro. But you can count on Casey Moore's to handle it in a professional and cautious way, and will always insure your comfort.  As long as you're respectful of common bar rules/laws, the staff, and other patrons, you're going to have an amazing time.  EDIT: THIS PLACE IS DOG FRIENDLY BEFORE 6PM SO PLEASE BRING YOUR PUPPY FOR ME TO PET, THANK YOU",

I called ahead and made a reservation for my family, letting them know it was a special occasion and that I'd be bringing my whole family, kids included.  They said it was no problem and that with her ID she could order her first legal drink at dinner that night.  We showed up and the place was packed to the gills due to the 'Tour de Fat' being the same night in Tempe.  We finally found parking and my family and I weaved through the crowd to find the entrance where the bouncer was checking IDs at the gate.  Now I understand his job, but I had reservations in the restaurant for the whole family and it was a bit of mess explaining to him that we were ALL going to dinner and we all didn't come prepared to produce IDs, including my 10 year old son who was with me.  He eventually understood and let us by so we could get to dinner.  Inside everything else went much more smoothly.  All of our dishes were fine.  And as a birthday gift the manager bought my daughter her first drink on the house, which I thought was really sweet.   They allowed me to bring in my own cake without an upcharge, and lent me a sharp knife to cut it and plates to serve it, we had a really nice time for her birthday!  tl/dr  This is a great place to celebrate a special event like a 21st birthday!",

What ticked me off was that she added a 20% gratuity to my bill because we had 6 or more people in our party... when I asked her how she got 6, she included the baby in that count. Um. He was in his stroller the whole time because he was tired. Most places will add a gratuity for large parties but really? Counting the baby to get to your 6?!?!

The crab cakes came shortly and it was paired with an aioli tasting sauce. It was really a good combination and I would highly recommend it. It's the best crab cakes I've tried even compared to steelhead diner in Seattle. The oysters came in after 20 minutes after the warning did mention on the menu to allow for up to 35 minutes. It was delicious, but very rich to the taste. It had cheese and spinach and with a spritz of lemon it was just right!   I came during happy hour and they knocked two dollars off my crab cakes or any appetizer and it all totaled up to 23 bucks including tax. It's fairly cheap.   I would come here again! I am a big fan of fresh raw oysters so that would probably be my next purchase.",

It wasn't until I got older that I had an honest to goodness dinner here, and that was f-ckin fabulous too.

It promotes a very chill vibe and a laid back atmosphere, which is what I, for one, look for when I'm having some drinks.

    "text": "This is my favorite bar. I used to live within walking distance, me and my roomie at the time were there almost everyday sometimes twice in one day. They've got good food, with good variety for whatever sounds good when you've been drinking. When i haven't been drinking I like the shrimp scampi, the sauce with the garlic toast is amazing! When i've been boozing and taking shots (which is usually the story with me and Caseys) i've been known to order multiple rounds of their greasy mozzarella sticks. They are obviousy the frozen-fry kind of food but when you got a good buzz going on, nothing beats the mozoralla sticks. Drinks at Caseys aren't expensive, and they are free poured. Which is always a plus in my book for any establishment. Mixed shots are huge. Service at Caseys is always hit or miss. You either get one of the servers/bartenders who has been there forever and gives you decent/good service with attitude/personality or you get stuck being served by someone who is new (rare) or the chick with the mustache who never smiles. Either way, your service isn't going to be the best but it won't be god awful. And when it comes down to it the ambiance will help you overlook any shortcomings. The outdoor patio is amazing, actually i've only sat inside once or twice and only because it was the hottest point of the summer. They have misters for the summer and heaters for the winter. Most of the patio is shaded, and there are lots of trees surrounding the restaurant itself. You will find all sorts of people at Caseys, but mostly the tattoo covered and pierced kind. If you're looking to go to Caseys on a Friday or Saturday night here is my advice on getting a table (which my roomie and i became pro at). First, stand in the middle and scope out the tables... Who is paying their tab? Which table has empty drinks? Who is leaving soon? Pick out your target tables. Now send in your blockers, have some of your friends stand in front of other people trying to scope out tables. Now when you finally see a table leaving, sit down as fast as possible. It is not uncommon to see people sit at a table before everyone from the previous party has cleared the booth. I know it sounds ruthless, but you'll be thanking me later.",

The outdoor bathroom is pretty unique too... I couldn't believe it the first time I went there.. I thought my buddies were messing with me.  Anyways... now that I'm not in Tempe I miss it so it's definitely worth going to",

I'm not going to bother writing an in-depth review because there are enough great review and very few bad reviews. I will say this Casey Moore's, unlike many of the bar around ASU, draws a diverse crowd. My art and design friends and my fraternity friends all came here regularly. It draws a bit older crowd as well, lots of alumni in the area still drop by.   As a restaurant I would give Casey's 4 or 5 stars too. Hell, whenever my mom would come to visit me she wanted to eat lunch as Casey Moore's. If you are averse to being around a bunch of college students then perhaps this is not the place you should be drinking at but it is still worth a visit for lunch or dinner before the night crowd comes.",

When I head over with friends, the bartenders will support the cause provide us with some of the stiffest cocktails ever.  My advice is to call a taxi and have it waiting before you order a double.

    "text": "Casey Moore's is the kind of place where you can get comfortable at 11 at night, drink a pint and smoke a pack with other weirdoes and hipster wannabes. I'm a little bit of an awkward geek, and I always find myself pretty comfortable here, regardless of the time of day or my mood at the time. Hang around the outdoor area around the side and back; that's the best spot in town and everybody seems to know it. Since it's just off-campus, they're naturally a little extra careful regarding ID checks. Both entrances are usually manned by someone checking IDs, and it's pretty much the standard for downtown Tempe, so get used to it. Drinks aren't cheap, but run pretty much standard for the area, and they do have a pretty decent selection of brews for the beer snobs (count me among said group). Their daily specials are worth taking advantage of when you can, and their food is pretty tasty when you're hungry and just need to chow. I'm not a huge seafood fan (blame my desert heritage), but even I can enjoy these things they call \"Oysters Rockafeller\". I think what I like most about the place is the interesting mix of people you're bound to meet here. It's deep in the heart of college town, smack dab in a neighborhood populated by crunchy old granolas and tattooed art punks. I think I ran into my old life drawing teacher there half a dozen times. Just don't let yourself be intimidated by the d-bag hipsters, and you can have yourself a pretty good time. Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest, but it's a rare place where you can find a steady flow of patrons and regulars every night of the week. I suppose that's the benefit of literally being the \"friendly neighborhood\" bar.",

I don't know).  I've heard that the restaurant food is actually good and that the oysters are flown in fresh daily.  The beer is decent.  The service is usually pretty slow.   Even at lunch when you are the only people there.  There are a couple of neighborhood cats that are always hanging around.  The people watching is good and I've had some of the my most interesting random conversations with people I've met in the ladies room.  It's just right there.  I could crawl home from there.  I could bike home from there.  I could walk on my hands home from there.  The point?  It is ridiculously close to my little house, therefore I frequent Casey's more than I might if it were on Mill Ave.  Plus I like polling men abotu their opinion on the Blarney stone (there are lovers and there are haters, but very few men fall in between).",

    "text": "Been here a couple times over the last few years.  The ambience is nice. Historic haunted house a few steps away from Mill.  I've only been here on weekends, and it's especially hard to get seats when ASU is in session.  Parking also can be difficult.  The food has always been OK.  They do have non-seafood items for people like me.  Service can be spotty.  My last visit, however, really changed my perspective on this place.  I would have rated this place 3 stars, but they failed in a couple of key areas.  It took over one and a half HOURS for us to get our entrees.  We did get appetizers and soup/salad for those who ordered them, but the gap between those and the entrees was noticeably long.  I understood that since we were a somewhat large party that it may take longer but still, that long?  I was starting to wonder if they just wanted us to keep the alcohol flowing and that we wouldn't notice how long the actual food took.  When I finally got my turkey croissant sandwich, there was very little turkey, as in 2 thin slices, and I couldn't detect the avocado, lettuce, or tomato.  I could definitely taste the bacon, though, since there seemed to be more bacon than anything else.  The balance of the whole sandwich was lost.  Everyone else was happy with their food.  At least the servers acknowledged at the end that it took a while and comped a few items.  Since it was a large party, they included the 18% tip in the bill despite the somewhat crappy service.  Since people were more interested in the movie afterwards, I wasn't going to contest that.  I'll reluctantly come here again which is why I rate it two stars.  Luckily, this isn't a place near the top of my friends' go-to list.  And I will try to talk people out of this place if it comes up.",

There were 4 of us and 2 of us order food initially and the orders came out about 5 minutes apart.   My friend order 1/2 dozen oysters (its an oyster house) and from his experience the person that shucked those oysters obviously was not a lover of them.  There were small broken pieces of the shell around the edges, and the bottoms were absolutely filthy dirty.  For being an oyster house you would think that would be the thing they take pride in, but not that night.  Then the remaining of our group ordered food and both those orders came out at separate times (almost 10 minutes apart) and one order was just a side of fries.  It's a great drinking atmosphere and a cool place to chill, but I wouldn't go expecting great service of great food.",

The food is very fresh with zero complaints every time & the fellow patrons are just as wonderful & so down to earth! Yes you're right there in college town but don't let that stir you away because the crowd is from the twenty somethings all the way to the hip sixty plus year olds! This place is definitely a spot where you can come as you are & there will definitely be no judgment or looks placed on you, it's so refreshing in this sometimes uptight world that we tend to live in!!

If youve only ever drank at Casey's, you NEED to come back for lunch/dinner one day. Their food is stellar.   Faves include: Hippie sandwich (I love that they use pesto as mayo), Potato salad, Fried Zucchini, Chipotle hummus, Reuben, Classic club, Croissant sandwich, and finally their New England clam chowder.",

The only reason I can't give it five stars is because I only tried one appetizer here and it wasn't oysters. I will be back one day and will update after I eat a meal here but for now, all you need to know is that this place is bad ass and just has a great vibe.  My buddy Paul brought me and some friends here for a night cap. The place was hoppin' and  we got lucky enough to find a table that fit four out on the patio. Patios, as most Valley residents know, are a focal point of the AZ culture. If crab cakes and football are what Maryland does, then Patios and Spring Training are what Arizona does. Anyway, they got a good one, definitely come check it out. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "I've had great experiences at Casey Moore's in the last 3 years I've been visiting. I'm often served by a lovely brunette woman with a British Accent, though I sadly haven't caught her name. The three stars would be five speaking solely on her performance!!! She's wonderful.   Tonight I visited Casey's with two childhood friends after being on Mill. We stopped at Circle k to indulge in snacks following our night in addition to a cup of ice prior to heading to Casey's.   There were no bouncers this Thursday evening around 1am when we strolled in. Acknowledging the industry, as current or previous restaurant workers ourselves, we considered we might need to throw away the cup of ice. With no bouncers at the entrance off of Ash, we were not met with this rule however.  After passing the entrance, we headed to a patio table and were rapidly greeted by an apparent guest. This man was an angry brunette bearded sir, who is apparently a manager named Tyler? We were informed by another angry blonde lady at the table of his name upon asking for the purpose of this review, so perhaps that wasn't his name, which warrants my question mark haha. Said blonde lady said verbatim \"His name is Tyler and he's a manager, good fucking luck.\" Inappropriate beyond belief but perhaps alcohol had gotten to her head.   Anyway, Tyler began to speak out loud about how we managed to \"get in with an outside beverage.\" Tyler was seated at a table himself, appearing to be a guest, with an alcoholic beverage. We were shocked by his aggression and rudeness. If he were a concerned employee off the clock, why wouldn't he reach out to another employee currently working regarding the situation and request we dispose of the cup?   The unprofessionalism of this situation led me to question my loyalty to Casey Moore's. I've loved this establishment in the past but found Tyler to be inappropriate most especially for the management position. I am also an industry worker so have patience and tolerance for my fellow workers!!! Tyler was out of bound enforcing rules while not only off the clock but while consuming alcoholic beverages. His \"friends\" were also embarrassing in their energy towards us.   There were various other approaches he could have taken towards handling this situation. I would have respected his concern had it been voiced while on the clock and without the presence of an alcoholic beverage.   This incident probably won't prevent me from visiting this establishment based on many positive experiences but perhaps \"Tyler\" needs a conversation regarding professionalism and how he represents Casey Moore's on and off the clock.",

It is definitely a casual place that you can just hangout at and get good food and definitely a great escape from the crowdedness of Mill on a weekend night. Super cute patio with lights and a little pond. The calamari is by far my best thing I've had here. The other food is good but nothing else has really stood out to me food wise. My fries this last trip were pretty soggy. Otherwise a great time will be back soon!",

Still great beers, still great service and reasonable prices. Wings this good anywhere else of this quality would be more money, and dinkier wings elsewhere are STILL more expensive! Casey's has always been a square deal.  PRO-TIP: Have the wing sauce MIXED (medium+teriyaki or medium + BBQ for example) and the wings served wet! OM NOM NOM! INSIDE SKINNY:  Get there early for Happy Hour, especially on Friday. If you arrive Friday 6pm the place is packed and you probably won't find parking or a free table, but there's the small lot directly next to Casey's on 9th that services the little apartments you can park in. Painted signs abound - \"We love Casey Moore's, parking allowed.\" Don't push your luck, everyone loves Casey's!",

The restaurant is in its old building the architecture and design is awesome. We had nothing but appetizers. I had the clam strips, the escargot, the oysters Rockefeller, chipotle humus, and ofcourse raw oysters. There is no selection of oysters just one standard one to choose from they were great and fresh not too big just like we like. I ordered the four peaks IPA draft and it was just right. My favorite appetizer was the escargot but it was only like 4 snails. Loved it and would co.e back on my next trip.",

The only thing I would recommend is placing some clear signs of what to do for first time guests. This was our first time so we didn't know if we should seat ourselves or if we had to see a hostess to be seated. After 10 minutes or so, we finally found a hostess who told us that for outdoor seating, we could just seat ourselves.  It would just be nice to know what the expectations are so we just aren't standing around trying to figure it ourselves.",

The good news is that the fish and chips and fried clams were first rate and by themselves would justify many happy returns. So, good food, great ambience, and great service.   The clam chowder was very good, but not world class. A little too creamy for my taste and a not enough chunky bits of clam and potato for my taste. Not bad, just had much better and tasty chowder.   Did I mention that the drinks are cheap and the servers were all nice and in tune with our rhythms?    So, the Oysters Rockefeller. I barely know what the say. We are somewhat experts in this cuisine having eaten Rockefeller in dozens of cities and several dozen restaurants.  These are the worst Oysters Rockefeller we have eaten in the last thirty years. I can't recall ever eating worse.  Almost inedible. If everything else wasn't so darn pleasant and my wife hates scenes, these would have been sent back charged guilty of tasting vile, not just suboptimal, but vile.   Please chef, order the oysters Rockefeller at Durrants and contemplate the difference. Durrants downtown has some very good Rockefeller that bear zero resemblance to whatever it is they think they are serving here.   I don't mean to be unpleasant but someone really has no clue.",

Fairly priced drinks, an entire patio (w/ bar) to huff on lung rockets, a friendly staff, and a mixture of every type of asu (pre/post/current) student you can handle.   For the fellas, if you gotta take a leak and don't want to go all the way into the bar to hit the bathroom, you can just go to the Blarney Stone (that is tucked in away from the partons dining on oysters) and release.   It's been a few years since I've been there, but if it is anything like it was back in 2004 then it is a great place for you to drink with your friends, and try to pick up some tail.",

So far, it has been the only consistently great bar I've found in Tempe, in part due to the fact that the crowd is so chill and not too clicky. It is True that it's predominantly ASU students, but a pretty wide spectrum of them, and it seems so laid-back I would think it would be hard for most to feel too out of place. I don't feel like I've walked into someone's private party at Casey's, and I very much appreciate that.   I've also got to give props to the well-made drinks, decent beer selection, friendly bouncers, and a surprisingly good bar menu. I've had excellent sandwiches here on a couple of occassions.  Of course, Casey Moore's wouldn't be Casey Moore's if it wasn't for that fantastic huge patio that is a huge reason why bars out here can be so much for relaxing than in other climates. It doesn't matter how crowded it is or whether or not I can get a seat, I just love to walk around out there with my beer or martini, people watch (or fish watch), and lounge. No matter how crowded it gets though, the vibe stays easy and friendly, and in the winter hot and toasty as you (and sometimes some cool lizards) huddle around the heat lamps.  Always a good time.",

But the service is absolutely the worst around (outside at least, and I would not recommend going inside). Expect to wait 15 minutes to get a waitress to notice your table and then expect another 15 between ordering and actually getting your drink. Oh, and don't be surprised it your waitress confuses Smithwicks with Fat Tire.  That said, the drink prices are good (especially during happy hour), the location is awesome, and nothing beats sitting outside at Casey's on a nice afternoon/night.  I would not recommend eating anything that isn't fried (how is this place an oyster house?!), though it does have good food for drunk people.",

Personally, I'm not a fan of the raw oyster's but I love their rendition of Oyster's Rockafeller. I think there lunch specials are also another bright spot of this establishment. If you add them on their facebook, they sometimes post their specials.  Aside from their food, their drink selection is rather simple. They don't really offer anything that I can't get anywhere else. The happy hour is not really mind-blowing either. I think a dollar off drafts and specials on wells if I remember correctly.  Really, what you are paying for is the ambiance. I get that it's historic and it's got an irish pub type theme, but I didn't really think it was anything special.  Oh, I forgot to mention, if you do decide you visit (and if you are male) if you have to use the blarney stone restroom on the outside patio. It's basically a simulated rock fountain that you pee on. Now that I think about it, I guess it sounds more fun after a few pints...",

Pros: The only place in Tempe, or the Valley for that matter, that I go for Ostyers on the half shell that are affordable at $12 per doz. Clam chowder and Onion au gratin soup are solid plays at $4 per cup. Great apps are the mountain of Clam strips for $6 or Cod fish and chips for $10, which are perfect when you're craving something fried to go with your brew. A surprise is the Angus quality beef - try the $22 petite filet with sides.  Cons: Parking sucks. Bouncers checking IDs at the doors are annoying. Hipster crowd smokes like chimneys and makes outdoor patio unusable for dining at night.",

All the people there are always really nice, the place usually has a good crowd and I always enjoy the jams they have playing. Weekends this place gets packed, but I can see why, it's a cool hangout. The place is tucked away in a neighborhood walking distance from Mill street and boasts a decent menu with corned beef and cabbage, and build your own burgers for reasonable prices to name just a few! The only reaosn I take a star off is because of the weird outdoor bathroom they have on the patio for men to pee on a streaming water wall... Just weirds me out.",

Every time I'm in this neighborhood too, it makes me want to move out of stucco hell into a neighborhood that actually has some character and interesting homes.    Mr. M used to have a weekday off and we'd be those people that roll in around 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon and just hang out and drink and talk and share some food and have our own little slow food movement going on for a few hours.  It was nice.  Now, no more weekdays off.    I've enjoyed going on a few Friday nights after I get in to Sky Harbor, and having a few drinks and good food to wind down after a long work week.  We discovered the people watching is WAY better on weekend nights too!  Who knew?!?!?  I get a kick out of the old men eyeballing the young chicks who have their clothing positioned just so around their tattoos, the real hippies, not hipsters in their little costumes, but real hippies, and just generally a happy, chilled out crowd.  It's a cool place with good service, good food, and good patrons.  We haven't ordered anything we didn't like, but some favorites are the crab cakes, the steamed clams, the burgers, and any cocktail with Jameson in it.  Or just some Jameson.  Bring us the bottle.  I finally saw one of those gnarly cats someone commented about.  DANG!  You're right.  Those things look like something else chewed on them and spit them out.  Or maybe the birds and cats have frequent smack downs by the dumpster.  I don't know, but if you sit outside you need to be ok with the wildlife hovering nearby.",

Especially if you're eating.  The food leaves much to be desired. Fish fry had absolutely NO flavor - the best thing on husband's plate were the fries. The fried shrimp was good, but a bit costly for 6 or so shrimp with no side! The escargot and garlic broth lacked taste and was served barely warm (not ideal). We were very disappointed by the food and would not recommend it. Worst $50 spent.",

Casey Moore's was recommended with the caveat that we go early as it turns less \"family friendly\" later in the evening.  We arrived around 5:30 on a weeknight and sat outside.  We liked that it was slightly outside the main area of Tempe and more in a residential district.  The surrounding houses have some nice character. I had some oysters as an appetizer and the 18 Jumbo Shrimp for my meal.  Both were great.  My son had the authentic tacos with grilled chicken and was impressed with the amount of chicken on the tacos.  My wife went with their \"lighter side\" choice and was pleased.  In summary, we enjoyed this local place with good food, good people, and a great environment.",

They have a small yet awesome selection of beer on tap. The burger I ordered was textbook standard, but nothing about it was memorable in my opinion. Im not sure if it was a lack in moisture or the bread wasnt great, but I finished it with little joy. The rockafeller oysters on the other hand were a treat! Granted, this aint Boston, but for being in a desert, this place has some pretty good seafood. The spinach and cheese were baked just right on these bad boys. I could have ate another dozen of these, if they werent so pricey (like most seafood is in general).   I enjoyed my time here, even though I could have lived without their burgers.",

The outdoor patio is shaded and gives you a different feel then the mill experience you get.   The only thing that didn't enjoy were the number of flies we had to swat away. They should invest in fly traps. Other than that, fantastic.",

The seafood sandwich was recommended by the waitress.    If we ever head back for some spring training action, will definitely give it another try - and eat a burger or something!",

    "text": "This is THE place to go if you want to hate on Scottsdale with your friends. It can get somewhat crowded and you'll find more elbow room outside on the expansive patio, but I've never seen it wall-to-wall people. This is pretty much a well-known fixture of downtown Tempe and it's frequented by all sorts of artsy cool-type people. It's not your typical college bar. It's also not really some sort of locals-only club.   I tend to get tired of going there easily because my friends who consider themselves too cool for Scottsdale always mention either that or Bikini Lounge or some other Central Phoenix hipster dive. I also find that most people are much younger than me... it's not as bad as a lot of bars near the campus, but it's still pretty obvious. That could just be that I'm getting too old to go out though. Perhaps I should just stay inside.   I mean, I agree with my friends who think Scottsdale is full of douchebags, but I staunchly disagree with their belief that there's nowhere cool to go in Scottsdale. Scottsdale is littered with awesome non-douchebag places to go. I guess that's beside the point... almost... I guess I just think that a lot of people from Phoenix and Tempe see Scottsdale as being full of snobs (Snobbsdale) apart from the douchebaggy scene. It seems like they are always saying how lame Scottsdale is because everyone sucks and blah blah, but that kind of attitude just sounds to me like reverse snobbery. Like \"I'm too cool to hang in Scottsdale... \" Whatever.  So Casey Moore's - it's basically an old reliable pub. Not the easiest place to get a drink at, but it's a cool place to chill and drink and talk with friends without having to yell over techno beats or top 40 hits. The upstairs is supposedly haunted and the owners are constantly pissing off the neighborhood residents because it's hard to find parking and people are noisy on the patio. Shit, I just realized someone else described the patio as \"expansive\" also - well, whatever - it is.   If someone says \"hey, meet me in Tempe - where should we go?\" Casey Moore's is probably going to top the list for lack of anything much cooler.",

    "text": "What can I say, that hasn't already been said about this place?  Casey Moore's is easily one of the best - if not most beloved - bars in the Phoenix area, hands down. I've now been going to the downtown Tempe classic for nearly 10-plus years on a routine basis. The food is okay, sure, but it's the atmosphere and clientele that makes the place so charismatic and inviting. Whether for a low-key evening, a bender, or a quintessential day-drinking getaway, Casey Moore's usually fits the bill. Even on busy nights the service is friendly and personable. The inside is dark and cushy, but it's the spacious, wrap-around outdoor patio area is what seals the deal for me. It's practically peaceful. Greenery and brick everywhere, the place oozes with un-Phoenix like character.  Though the crowd at Casey Moore's is often just as image-conscious (respectively and respectfully), it's never as obvious or boorish as say, a lounge in downtown Scottsdale. From low-key urban hipsters and college intellectuals, to artists, writers, and musicians, the vibe is always unpretentious and welcoming.  And yes, because of Casey's crowds, their parking lot is usually packed. However, with the amount of street parking allowed in the immediate area around it, it's actually not a headache at all.",

    "text": "This is a fun place for appetizers and drinks if it is not too crowded and the temperature is just right outside.  Otherwise the inside gets way too packed and you have to go outside where it is sometimes way to hot or way to cold depending on what month you go.  I have been here many many times for dinner/drinks/appetizers and have had a good experience every time.  I am not really a fan of most of their food but do enjoy their oysters and their beer.  The service is relatively quick, prices reasonable, and staff fast and friendly as long as it isn't too busy.  However, this review isn't just about sitting outside drinking beers with a few friends.  This is about a very unique experience I had recently.  Until recently I had no idea this place even had an upstairs.  It turns out there are a few small rooms upstairs where patrons can dine.  So, I reserved tables for 10-12ish people that were to join my fiance and I for dinner/drinks for her birthday.  I called a few days prior and they were very friendly and said it wouldn't be a problem.  Upon arrival the night of we were taken behind the bar where a \"secret\" staircase could be found that leads upstairs.  I have been here many times and had NO idea about those steps or where they led.  Anyway, up the stairs, are 2 what used to be bedrooms converted into dining areas.  Each room had several small tables.  They reserved one of the rooms for my party which was perfect.  They put all the small tables together in the middle of the room and it was more than enough room for everybody.  Our waitress and servers were quick, friendly, and had plenty of stories about the \"haunted\" 2nd floor.  The food was ok and I should have just stuck with oysters and shrimp but oh well.  I guess its all about the same after a few drinks.  We were upstairs at our table for about 2 hours and they didn't try to rush us out which was good on this busy Friday night.  I could have sat up there longer to avoid the hassle of going downstairs and fighting to get a drink and a table, but my party grew restless.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a picnic table outside and had the \"typical\" Casey Moore's experience.",

The crowd ranges from incredibly down to earth and musically inclined, to yuppy gay hipster, with a liberal smattering of Tempe Locals Faculty  and Students.  I don't really think that anyone plans to come to Casey's to eat. You eat at Casey's because you have been drinking!!!  This place has a really beautiful grounds. The beer garden and victorian really are a lovely setting in which to soak in your friend's story while. Lot's of eye contact and flirting seem to go down here!",

    "text": "My visit was less than spectacular... I'm evaluating 3 main points: Food, Location/ambiance, and service...  1.This is supposed to be THE place to go for oysters, fish, drinks, etc. The food was NOT impressive. Everything lacked flavor and at the same time everything tasted the same. no distinctive flavors. The fish didn't taste like fish, the fries didn't taste like fries, etc... I went simple thinking i'd better try something \"safe\" so I had the Fish & chips platter. the fish was mediocre... the batter was thin, not crispy at all. It had no salt, flavor, or seasoning whatsoever. I've actually had better fried fish @ Mimi's Cafe and Tom's BBQ, neither of which specialize in fish and it was 1000 times better. The side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning. The fries were limp and had absolutely no salt. The coleslaw was dry, had no flavor and was hard for me to even get through one single bite.  2. I was NOT impressed at all with the property or location. The property is just \"ok\".  The only reason it's a big deal is because it is a historic house in the \"downtown Tempe area\" that has been converted into a bar/restaurant. It just has lots of busy posters, lights,and all the groovy stuff bars normally have. Nothing out of the ordinary... Location - It's not in the heart of Tempe at all..., it's in a neighborhood just around the corner from the \"heart of Tempe\". Like I mentioned before. It's a converted house, therefore as you can imagine, it is in a residential neighborhood. They have a patio, which is pretty much unbearable to sit out there 9 out of 12 months during the year, and the inside is small, dark and cramped. There isn't much to see outside anyway other than hippies, skateboarders and homeless people coming out of the alley way behind the circle K up the street.  3. The service is not spectacular either. I walked in and was greeted by NO ONE. Since the patio is the first thing you walk in to, you have no idea where to go when you're there! There are people sitting and drinking & eating all around, but no greeter, server or anyone to seat you are even tell you where to go. I did what seemed logical and walked IN to the actual house and you run right into the bar. The bartender pretty much just looked at me and said \"grab a menu and sit anywhere\"... WOW! It took about 5 minutes for a server to even notice I was there waiting to be attended to.  This was my first visit and needless to say my LAST!!!!",

So if you are looking to go out and party with friends, it is a great spot.  Casey's also has a really nice upstairs for a classy dinner, and the rumor is that it's haunted.  The inside is a bit limited, but when you are in Tempe, AZ, you drink outside.  I mean, the weather is beautiful, and so are the ladies that attend this establishment.    The food is fantastic and the drinks are great, although it is a little pricey, and you can smell the pretentiousness in the air.

The typical beer selection is getting old even though I am sure they make a killing off what they have always served. I guess thats what makes this place good. But I personally want to see more beer!!  I use to frequent this place at night but only during the day and HH to avoid the hipster crowd who think they and this place is the shit! Sorry, yeah...I forgot my fixed gear bike at home and my chucks too! Deal with it! Oh wait, I don't own any of those things cause I am not a hipster nerd! No tats either!! So I go when the crowd is semi-normal for Tempe...haha! Yeah right! Anyway, love the oysters and the typical mesh of east coast and west coast seafood treats.

    "text": "I love Caseys. One of the only spots in Tempe I feel like has some character. The people that work there are nice- as long as you aren't a drunk idiot. Bar staff is cool- lots of regulars frequent this place. After about 10pm it turns into a younger crowd for sure. It's one of my favorite places in Tempe to just chill and shoot the shit with randoms. I appreciate that the staff doesn't tolerate assholes. I've never had a problem here, because I don't get out of control drunk and I don't start fights with people. Dog friendly patio too before 5pm(ish) which I always appreciate too because I don't have a dog but love to aww over cute ones. Oysters are my fav, good salads and French onion soup. Could eat a million things on the menu everyday and not get sick of it. Prime rib is delish on Fri/Sat nights. Try a Cactus Cooler as well.",

    "text": "We were told this is the cool and hip bar that ASU folks frequent. And that they have bomb oysters and various plates of fried fishy goodness. So we had to check out this \"staple\" bar.  The atmosphere is casual and laid back. You can grab seating at the patio (recommended if the weather is bearable) or at the cozy wood-themed indoor bar. The place was quite empty, but we visited on a Wednesday night so that was expected.  The food was okay. Oysters were fresh but the flavor was a bit off. One of the oysters in our plate was spoiled and that ruined the plate for us. Luckily, the waiters were glad to replace it for us. The fried bar food selection includes fried mushrooms, fried oysters, and fish n chips, among others.  None of the plates were remarkable, except for the Oyster Rockefeller, which I highly recommend.  Wide selection of local beers on tap. And I hear this place is happening during happy hours.  ----  Distinguishing factor: Warm and cozy bar with a lively local college scene and fresh selection of oysters and fried goodies.",

Casey's gets a bit busy on the weekends, so if you don't want to stand, I would recommend arriving earlier in the night to grab an open table! When school is out, its a lot less busy! My favorite dishes here are the Chicken Pesto and the Escargot! The Chicken Pesto has a great seasoned pesto sauce, which compliments the grilled chicken breast very well, on top of linguine noodles, served with a side of garlic bread! Its amazzzzing! I have had the Escargot twice and I am not a huge snail fan, but the sauce Casey's serves the Escargot in, makes the dish!!! Squeeze some of the lemon on top of those snails and dig in! This dish also comes with 2 pieces of their yummy bread! Last of course I can finally say I had the Oysters!!! For my first time trying these, I was super nervous I would actually spit them out, lol, but to my surprise they were pretty tasty! Our server delivered a dozen to us, on a huge ice plate! We all dug in and everyone seemed to like them! Great place to kick back with your friends, have a drink and a yummy dinner!",

When the weather is mild or cold this is a really great place to go.  I love the patio seating, it is comfortable and plentiful and the grounds are relatively attractive.  The seating outside is well spaced enough to not have to share your elbow space with strangers, but close enough that you can easily mingle with others.  All around a great patio!  The service is fine, but not stellar.  They are usually quite busy, so while the wait staff is pleasant, they are sometimes lacking in attentiveness.  The food has never been bad, but has definitely been mediocre at times.  The one thing that is terrible is the parking.  Since they are always busy, the parking areas are overflowing.    All in all, I like this place.  Only the heat deters me, since I prefer their patio seating over the indoor area.",

It's a cozy place on the inside and out, Couldn't catch her eye but I didn't pout, I don't mind cause she probably likes No Doubt, That band sucks and Gwen Stefani has gout.  I sat at the bar and ordered Kilt Lifter, It came in a pint and not in a snifter, Slick, switch the 100 for a 10 like a grifter, I got the chrome skull on my Jeep's shifter.

Most of the hot weather last year they didn't have the misters working. The food is very hit and miss lately says a lot when the fries are the best thing to eat there lately. There is a door guy that really needs an attitude adjustment the older guy with white hair that is, The other guy with the dread is awesome and never have issues but the other guy seems to want to instigate a fight with people. I do love the crowd and that is the only reason to keep going back here, without this element it's just a bad imitation of an Irish bar.

But she messed it up, and that was not unexpected considering the policy they have to go by.  But then when we got it back and tried to explain the problem to her, she got a little snippy.  Then got a little attitudinal.    Love the food.  But this \"one check per party\" policy really brings the place down, and causes the servers and customers both some grief.  Not good.",

I came here after I graduated from ASU and ordered the Hippie sandwich with extra jalapenos.... just be aware that those are raw because I was not and my mouth was on fire for the next 5-6 hours...no exaggeration. It's surrounded by a lot of trees so it kind of feels like you are somewhere else and keeps it cool. Hard to believe it is so close to Mill because the crowd is soooo different.

They have a great outside patio area.  Casey's has a pretty good beer selection, both drafts and bottles. They have the beers that are typical of an Irish Pub. It's not the largest selection that you will find, but it's very solid. They have rotating beer of a day special, with a different brew featured every day of the week.   They have a very good and diverse appetizer list where you'll find anything from escargot to mozzarella sticks. My favorites have to be \"Chipotle Hummus\", \"Crab Cakes\", and the \"Fried Clam Strips\".   Looking forward to going back to try their dinner menu.  Good beer selection, awesome appetizers, and great atmosphere, give Casey Moore's an above average rating of four stars.",

    "text": "Where do I start with Casey Moores? The food is freaking fantastic. I'm from Boston and their clam chowder is in my top 3 favorites. Their fried clam strips are equally awesome.   It's a good place to meet up with friends for drinks or even just a place to hang out at all night. It's got an awesome outdoor patio as well.   But the service even during the day can be pretty shitty and the bouncers can be equally as shitty. Since it's close to ASU they inspect and reinspect ID's and they have been known to hassle patrons. Another drawback they start carding way early. Most bar/pub/restaurants don't start carding until about 9. I brought a friend for a late dinner once at around 7 and the bouncer was already checking ID's so she couldn't get in. But inside it's usually a pretty good crowd and you'll always see a familiar face.",

    "text": "Casey Moore's is one of few places in downtown Tempe were I can relive my ASU glory days, without remembering how long it's been since they passed me by.  It's probably the only spot around Mill Avenue where I can go to on a Saturday night and not feel like I'm too old to be there.  If it's not too crowded, and isn't too hot outside, it may be the perfect bar to relax and have a drink.  Maybe it's because the bar is in middle of a neighborhood, or maybe the koi pond, or the \"fire pit,\" or all the wood tables, but when you drink on the patio, it feels like you're sitting in a big backyard.  If there were a pool, it would be the younger single me's dream backyard.  Casey Moore's also has pretty good selection of beers on tap.  What more do you need?  It's been a while since I've eaten at Casey Moore's, but the food is pretty good.  A few years ago, I had the opportunity to eat with a big party in hidden room on the upper level.  There's two converted bedrooms you'd never know about unless you got up there.  It was a pretty fun private dinning experience.  The staff was very attentive and engaging.  They even told a few stories about how the second room has haunted.  I'm not much of a believer in ghost stories, but still entertaining to hear.  We must have been up there for at least two hours before going outside to have some drinks in the crowd.",

The tables and seats are dated and probably need to be replaced but we kind of like dive bars.  This really isn't a dive bar but the booths more adequately belong in one.  We got there a little after 5 and it was busy but still got a table (booth).  Parking is always a bit hairy down there but after circling the lot a few times a few spots opened up.  We had a bunch of oysters and were extremely happy.  I haven't had good oysters in AZ so I was very happy to taste freshness and get real horseradish to put on them.  We ordered a couple more apps and took full advantage of the happy hour $2 off apps.  We do like fried pickles but these ones are spears and we both prefer the fried pickle wheels.  The hummus was good and it had a kick to it which we like.  Really want to come back.  Hopefully we have a similar experience.  Oh and the service was excellent from the lady we had.",

I ate there a year ago but it was after a friend passed away so I wasn't really paying attention to anything but trying to console a few friends.  A friend of mine took me here for my birthday and we brought the dog.  We sat outside and it was in the 70's in december which could be another reason we enjoyed our lunch so much.    This place has great service.  Melisa served us I would recommend you ask for her if you are there.    A few things stand out.  First they brought the furry friend water first thing.  Which is very cool.  The other amazing thing is the potato skins are the best I have ever had.  I realized that it's not a trendy dish these days and most places don't serve it anymore.  They have mild chili peppers under the cheese.  I thought everything we ordered was made with love and used only quality ingredients.    This place is not only a Tempe landmark but a Tempe gem.  If you haven't eaten there yet you should give it a try.",

The server was kind and made honest recommendations based on quantity of food vs. plate price. She also served the pooch some water.

Casey Moore's is a classic establishment hidden from Mill Ave. Whenever I've come here, the vibe is always chill - nothing too wild and crazy.   This particular time, I came on a Wednesday for Happy Hour. I ended up getting a basket of chicken fingers and fries, which were good but the breading was a little salty at times. My friend got the steamed mussels, and she asked to add in linguine in (custom). The server was nice about it and said, \"yeah we can do that.\" The food came out quickly. We weren't pestered by the server - she came when she saw empty glasses. She was great.   The only thing I really didn't like about our seating was that it was behind the fans at the bar. So, whenever anyone lit a cigarette, that smoke was coming your way. This, unfortunately, was quite often. It put a damper on the experience, but that is a personal thing. Next time, I'll know where not to it.  Oh yes. And during Happy Hour, a dozen oysters is $12...",

Based on previous yelp reviews I decided to go with the battered zucchini and the crab cakes. Definitely did not disappoint. The portions were generous (especially the zucchini) and it didn't take too long to come out. We did have to wait a good 10 minutes before anyone came to greet us and take a drink order. When she finally arrived, the waiter seemed to be a tad *different*, not in a bad way, just what you'd expect a very hipstery restaurant's staff to be like. Was very quiet and didn't come around too much, but still nice. One thing to note is that the outside patio where the majority of tables are is a smoking area so beware if you are pretty sensitive to cigarette smoke. It was tolerable for my friend and I but can see it being a problem for someone who isn't previously aware.",

I couldn't bring my 19 year old brother to eat because the bouncer (not much bouncing, but a lot of smoking cigarettes at the entrance and blowing it in my vicinity) says I don't pass as a guardian. We weren't even there to drink. Red Lobster has a bar...and you can get food there too apparently. Very unhappy with the one minute experience I had here. Oh well.",

We only sit at the bar because enjoy the conversations of the real old timers that are regulars everyday if not twice a day. The lunch food is good and reasonable and fairly large portions. Service and staff are always friendly attentive.  Always a nice beer selection. The Oyster Rockefeller is one of my favorites along with the Fried Oysters. Charcoal Grilled Burgers are fantastic. The Club Sandwiches and Wraps are huge. Wings I think are the best in Phoenix (much much better than the \"chain wing restaurants\") I used to get the fresh oysters, but found they have been getting smaller and skinnier (need a new supplier)  Love this place, so much character, good bar food and service. Lunch and sitting at the bar is how we roll!",

    "text": "So I'm from the Phoenix area (south Scottsdale), but went away for college. Most of my friends stayed home and went to ASU (eventually after going the junior college route). Luckily I graduated in 4 years. Most of my friends did the 5 year plan so when I moved back after graduation it was like I had another year socially (which was interesting with the whole job thing, and all). Anyway, during that \"social\" year I spent a LOT of time at Casey Moore's and really liked it. I continued to go every now and then over the years, but it seemed like as we got older (and the crowd here stayed younger) we just kind of stopped going.   I went to a show at Gammage recently w/my mom and I randomly suggested we come here for happy hour beforehand since it's close by. We both loved it (she got a real kick out of having to show her ID when we walked in)! It pretty much looked the same as I remember it. Most of the seating is on the large patio. There's a bar on what I would consider the back of Casey Moore's surrounded by wooden booths and a coy pond. There's plenty of additional outdoor seating near the front of the restaurant. The inside isn't huge. There's a couple of smaller dining rooms and of course, a bar.   I sat inside with my mom (luckily there was a table available). Honestly, in all my years coming here I don't remember having food (I probably did at some point). We ordered a half dozen oysters, fried calamari & escargot. Everything was delicious! I loved the butter sauce the escargot came in & the calamari portion was HUGE. During HH all apps are $2 off. I ordered a couple beers and I believe they're a $1 off during HH.  Service was friendly. This is a fun place to come to with a group. Honestly, even though Casey Moore's is close to ASU since it's a little off Mill Ave. I think it attracts some Tempe locals (not just students) so it's a fun mix of people.   I'll be back.",

I like a little more variety but these were yummy! Watch out for the atomic horseradish! They ain't kidding!  I was in an oyster mood so I had the Oyster Po-boy also. I ordered the pico de gallo on the side and it was a good choice. The romalade sauce was perfect. I did taste the pico and it was great but I didn't want to lose the great taste of the oysters. Fries were yummy with a pinch of Parmesan.  Great service and a great vibe.  Great find!",

During lunch, the place seems a bit empty compared to how crowded and packed it is on weekend nights.  Its really hard to find parking during those times unless you ride a motorcycle.  Weekend night crowd is mostly college crowd but lunch and happy hour crowd seems to be mixed with different kinds of people here.

With that said, this place is really cool! i'm sure everyone outside appreciated the ample heaters during the unnatural chill we've been experiencing lately.   They have a sweet happy hour, but don't fret: beer pints are only $4.50 as regularly priced! The affordable pricing and unassuming attitude of this establishment makes it a go-to spot for drinks and more.   I will say that during this particular experience, I had ordered the Raj IPA (from 4 peaks). What I got was not the Raj, but rather a bit of a mix between the Raj and another Tangerine-y beer. The bartender confirmed that this was the case (and that I was not crazy), and gladly gave me another beer (Lagunitas IPA) to replace it. The error cost a star, but the kind response gave that star right back.   Stay the same, Casey Moore's!",

I'm a big fan of their oysters and turkey croissant sandwich as a safe \"go to\". Today I chose to try their steak tacos and they were so flavorful! I also suggest trying their French fries- they are the best!! It's good to know that their patio is also dog friendly during the day. The Casey Moores neighborhood is filled with a lot of trees, so there is plenty of shade.",

    "text": "I have been to Casey Moores Oyster and Seafood Restaurant in Tempe, Arizona a bunch of times and will continue to go back. We even had a holiday party there one year for work.   \"The House\" has seating indoors and outdoors with a bar in either place. Due to the laws in Tempe that prohibit people from smoking publicly indoors, outdoor seating is really popular. If you want to come home smelling like smoke, then you'll love sitting outdoors. Everybody in the nation will light up right next to you. :-)  At first I hated Casey Moores, but I have grown to love it. The atmosphere at Caseys is laid back and very chill.. after you've had a few drinks in you. Don't let the general dirtiness of the outside seating area deter you from getting completely tanked. After a while you won't even notice the smoke around you.  I would recommend the fried zucchini and the hummas. Both of which are good combinations when mixed with your choice of booze. When school is in session this place gets rather packed depending on what time you go. But when it does get packed there are some really hot chicks that can be found at this establishment.",

    "text": "When people in Arizona complain about the seafood we have I want to smack them. What do you expect in the F-ing desert? I grew up in the Ocean State, 40+ years of top New England fresh seafood on my doorstep. I don't expect that in Tempe but I know where to find good seafood, Casey Moore's is my first choice.  This is a very cool bar, a neighborhood hangout, not some corporate designed food slinging franchise. They don't have the big bucks backing them up so they better be consistently good, or they're out of business. CMOH has been in business for a very long time, and business is good.  I prefer Friday when the dinner specials go on the board. I've had marlin, shark, swordfish, ono, mahi and all kinds of fish you don't find in AZ restaurants. You never know what they'll have for fish specials. I'm rarely disappointed. I have the oysters regularly and Casey's Oysters Rockefeller is one of the best I've had in my life, including my home state.  The patio is often packed, the bar gets crowded, the many small dining rooms are full, so you may have occasional lapses in service. The CMOH staff is very good but sometimes they're overwhelmed by the popularity of their pub. The bar staff is second to none, I should know, I've bellied up to many bars in my day.  Rumor has it the upstairs dining rooms (formerly bedrooms) are haunted. I don't know, but I love dining up there. It's a great place to take a date. The menu is varied, from bar standards to specials you won't find anywhere else.  Give Casey's a chance, and if you're not convinced, try again. You may be the problem, the common denominator in all your bad restaurant reviews.",

The service can be a little slow some days, but with those stairs, I can completely understand that. They do seafood right out here and I've only had better when I'm near a body of water. People who complain about seafood in AZ should stop and think about that for a second.  I admit that the smoke gets to me sometimes and it's annoying to stand through the door and wait for someone to wait on you. It seems like a crap shoot when someone will see you, but maybe I'm wrong and they have radios ready.   Personally, I have really enjoyed their oysters, clam strips, fish and chips, etc. Hasn't made me sick and the prices for seafood isn't bad compared to the more upscale seafood places.   If you're there for the food, go early. If you want drinks and maybe some food, go later.",

The outside patios are big with plenty of seating and shade. Our first waitress was great. She was very attentive. We got beers and our oysters came quick. Some of the biggest oysters I've ever had! But the shucking was a lil sloppy, pieces of she'll in almost every oyster. No biggie tho. My issue came when our waitress said her shift was over and she wanted to cash out. No problem, this happens all the time. We got our bill n paid her. She asked if we'd be staying and we said yes. She said she'd tell the new waitress to check on us. There were at least three new waitresses in our area and none of them came to check on us. We had empty pints and a giant bowl of eatin oyster shells sitting on our table. We gave them some time. We all went to the bathroom, still nobody came by. I asked one waitress if she could help n she said she wasn't our waitress and walked away. So after sitting there for 15 mins and nobody, not even a bus boy to clear our shells came by, we left and went to another bar and had much better service. The oysters were good, the beer selections a lil weak, and the staff (other than our 1st waitress who was from Michigan, can't remember her name) was inattentive. Might be back, for some oysters n a quick beer...maybe",

Great atmosphere, diverse crowd, good stuff on tap (my favorite is the Four Peaks Scottish Amber), great outdoor seating area.  For dining they get 3 stars.  It has been several months since I left New England and Casey Moore's is my first venture out for seafood, albeit with diminished expectations.  That being said, my Fish & Chips ($11.00, Cod, not the Haddock overhanging the plate I had grown accustomed to) was pretty good.  The fish was lightly battered and done just right-moist, tender, soft and juicy.  The chips were skin -on fries.  My wife had Salmon Oscar.  The salmon was slightly overdone, and the crab and hollandaise sauce was a little too fishy.  She ordered a double cooked baked potato that looked and tasted exactly like the prefab twice baked potato's that came with some Omaha Steaks I received from my boss last Christmas.  There were also slices of zucchini and yellow squash which were sauteed with mild seasoning.  The waitress was outstanding and gave us unbiased recommendations such as: \"I would stay away from the Surf & Turf.  We just don't go through enough lobster and the kitchen doesn't always do a great job with it.  It gets sent back sometimes.\"  Good to know.  She also recommended the Salt Cellar for great Fish & Chips.   Overall, I would give them 3 stars and I would return for Fish & Chips and drinking.",

The food isn't great and is rather overpriced for what you get, but it's basically average pub-grub (price aside). I'd avoid the Reuben, though. I don't know what they do to their corned beef, but it's like chewing on corned beef-flavored rubber. However their club sandwich is reasonably decent as is the fish and chips (although occasionally the batter is too thick).  They have beer specials every day of the week for $3 a pint, which is great. I've never had a problem with any servers, though. Occasionally they'll be a little absent-minded, but c'est la vie.",

    "text": "So for my 100th review I decided to write about Casey Moore's. It is a delightful combination of two bars at Ohio State that my husband and I frequented quite often during our years in Columbus, so it brings back fond memories of nights of heavy drinking and chilling on outdoor patios during the few precious months of warmth we have in the Midwest.  Casey's is a great spot if you want a laid back bar, especially on a Friday afternoon when you skip out of work early.  My husband and I are big fans of places where we can sit outside, have a few glasses of beer, and catch up since during the week we are occasionally too busy to really see each other much.  The other great thing is the cross section of people Casey's attracts...undergrads, grad students, professors, young professionals like myself, and other folks who live in or around the neighborhood.  Service has always been friendly and prompt each time we've been there, whether it be a Friday afternoon at happy hour or a Wednesday or Thursday night at 10 pm.  The only food we've ate at Casey's has been the mozzarella sticks (the perfect fried food companion to beer) and they are delicious...I really enjoy the light battering because it doesn't sit so heavy in my stomach.  My only small gripe with Casey's is their parking lot which gets full pretty quickly and you can't park on some of the streets until a certain point in the evening.  But I guess that really means that my husband and I shouldn't be so lazy and should just ride our bikes.",

The food is great, much better than bar food, which is what some people mistakenly think they are going to get.  $4 will get you a super strong well drink, I have been knocked on my ass more times than I care to think about from their pours.  The staff is great and really does know your name.  I have been kicked out but they always let me back it.  Once after a bitchy girl started screaming at me and calling me names for no reason, the owner offered to kick her out simply because he knows I am a regular and would never fight in his bar.  That is customer service at it's best.  I miss you Casey Moore's, I don't go often enough anymore... I must change that...",

The colors are the gaudy southwest type and the building is rather large and unassuming. Must be a converted house smack in the University District, right? Yes. That it may be, but it's so much more than that. Inside tends to get crowded but where the real action is at is on the ginormous patio they house. There is a separate bar outside for all the action and plenty of people flock to it's calling. There are drinks a plenty, people watching a plenty, food a plenty and oysters. Oysters?  In the desert? Sure, why not? Shuck em down!  Bonus: for the guys, the Blarney Stone is not to be missed!",

    "text": "I want more of Casey Moore's, but the question is how much more?  My first experience with Casey's was a good one.  Keep in mind I went on a Wednesday night,  and it was mellow. I think this place could be rather obnoxious on a weekend, if it full of ASU students. I was fortunate to be hanging with some Grad students and couple post graduate people, all who were mature and chill. Reading some of the negative reviews (and talking to friends)  I get the impression a few meatheads, could really ruin this place for someone.   The decor, location, and sprawling layout makes this place very different from most Tempe Bars. It's hidden away on Ash st. and besides being right next to train tracks, it's very quiet. I like the fact it's old, weathered and nostalgic. CMs has a good variety of beer, and great prices (Stella for $3.50 Woohoo!)   I think like any place who you meet up with, will enhance your experience. I had a chance to talk to some fellow Bostonians, as we chatted about Boston culture.  Throwing lines out like \"Get the Pitccha it's cheapa\"  or \"I'm foockin Caaacked.\"  My personal favorite topic of conversation, discussing the dreaded all white Red Sox hat turned backwards. Anyone from Boston knows not to mess with this guy.   I suggest CMs, for drinking and conversation, and now having been there on a weekend, it's still  pretty chill, at least after Midnight, where we can let it all hang out.",

I can talk mad shit on this place all night long, but when it comes down to it, I love it. The location lends to its patrons- alternative college students living in the only historic (PHX like) neighborhood in Tempe. Plus it is right next to HTC, so everyone is sure to be rocking the flyest of  -50 gauges. puke.  but.......the charm of casey's is in the cats. they are cool and roam around. Also, the best patio ever, and lots of room. Don't go inside unless you can't get a drink b/ your waitress forgot about you (which is most likely what happened). Or if you like old dudes 65+ eyefucking the shit outta you be my guest. Also, one night after I was there, the next morning someone had charged $2000+ on my credit card for an ad in New Times. shady......or recession? I think I know how this happened, they leave your card within an arms reach from the bar inside, face-up so any creeper with 20/20 can get a peek and thief you out of your identity and money, or maybe it was an inside job???  but I really like this place and still have \"casey's nights\" even though jimmy eat world sucks and I live in phoenix.   oh yeah, this place is haunted too....and if you are a girl do not go pee in the grotto.gross.",

We were a party of 8 engaging in light drinking and mostly appetizers.   This was not culinary calculus.    I've served.  I've served parties ranging in size from 1-63.   Never, ever has it been a problem giving people separate checks, even 63 of them.   You teach your party to be patient but give them what they want.  \"We aren't really supposed to do separate checks\" is your way or signifying to me that you're lazy or stupid, with neither being a quality I want from a server.     Fried food, burgers, wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen.  What makes a restaurant standout is how welcoming it is, pardon the cheesey reference, but how much like Cheers it is.   The first step in the journey to earning loyal customers if service and whining about separate checks is no step forward--it's a backflip.",

    "text": "This place really doesn't need another review, but seeing how it's my home away from home, I feel obliged to speak up from the peanut gallery.  I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.  It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.  I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well.   French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.  It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.  Dearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too.",

I thought at the time that any drinking venue near ASU would be all the same - meatmarket bars full of interchangeable guys with too much gel in their hair and interchangeable girls with too much boob under their, uh, boobs.   But Casey's was chill. Sure, I was older than everyone else probably by a decade or more, but it didn't matter. Everyone was hanging out at tables in the massive patio just enjoying time with their friends. No Usher's\"Yeah\" blasting out of the speakers for the 5 billionth time. No girl spilling her fifth cosmo. No posers.  Just real people.   And Guinness.  Can't forget the Guiness.  5 stars for keeping it real.",

It has a frustratingly small parking lot.  The service is slow and the staff is generally pretty obnoxious.  The food ranges from typical bar fare to a  couple upscale dishes.  The deal breaker here is the atmosphere.  I see reviews stating that it's a \"great laid-back place to go hang out\".  I'm not sure what bar they were talking about, but it isn't Casey Moore's.  This is the type of place people go to be seen.  Most of the patrons on the weekends look like they fell out of an Urban Outfitters ad.  These are the type of people that spend three hours in front of the mirror perfecting their \"just threw this outfit on\" look.  Yes indie kids, I'm talking to you: Don't worry, they serve PBR here.  I know you'll lose your superhero powers of \"listening to music no one's ever heard of\" if you don't consume at least one Pabst a day.   If you're determined to go, go on a weekday and avoid the hipsters.   People send friends ahead to camp out tables for entire weekend evenings, so good luck finding a place to sit.

I started coming here while still in grad school at ASU in 2000 and I was hooked by the best patio in the Valley and the eclectic mix of people indie, students, yups (.... the sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, dickheads  ... okay, that last part was from Ferris Beuller).    There is no better mesh of drinkers in the valley than you will find at Casey's.  Its a comfortable place for everyone to come and drink.  Heck, i even had my after-graduation reception here with a bunch of family and out-of-towners who really enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks and food as well.  Its a place to come for day drinking, happy hour, special events (St Paddy's), early evening, pre-concert, late night, and last call. Its good to take your date or your best friend or even the fam.  If you like beer, its your spot, if you like the hard stuff, its your spot.  It is truly \"the perfect bar\".  Oh, and you can always count on this place being \"alive\" because something that really fucks me up about the Valley are the lack of people drinking in bars I'm at ... and that kind of atmosphere tends to suck all the life out of the evening.",

The bartenders are pretty fast and spot on. the prices are average. The food is pretty good, and not too expensive. It's a great place to go to spend an evening with friends or to meet new people. It can get pretty busy and the parking lot is not very big so sometimes you have to walk a little bit, but usually not much.",

I was here yet again with some amazing people the other night... we're that table that never stops laughing and is always having a good tme.  The food... ok so I've only eaten the food here once, and I ordered the fish & chips... it says best in town. Not the greatest tasting food ever I was incredibly hungry and ate most my fish, and all the cole slaw. I must admit I am a used to really amazing fish & chips moving to AZ from San Francisco and always being in Malibu. But considering I'm now in the middle of the desert they were pretty legit.  I would say go here and drink your night away. I love people watching here and sitting outside in the trees I feel like I'm in  a secret spot where you could possibly see a unicorn.",

    "text": "I've been here once, and I will only go here once. I met my husband and some friends there after work sometime in February, when it was still cold enough at night to require jackets and outdoor heaters to sit outside. We were seated in a dark corner of the patio, where there were THREE portable heaters, none of which were turned on. We asked our ditzy, busty, DUMB waitress FOUR TIMES to turn them on, and she kept saying, \"I'll have to ask someone to do it. I don't know how.\"  I finally asked her WHO she had to ask, and she pointed to the dirty looking guys acting as bouncers at the gate, who apparently are the only ones in the joint authorized to turn on the heat lamps. Fine. I walked over to them and asked if we could get our heaters turned on, and the guy walked right over and did it for us. Took all of 30 seconds.   Oh, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, several of the orders were messed up. And the waitress didn't care. And it wasn't that good.   Can you tell I didn't really care for this place (note my frequent use of all-caps)? And yet it will continue on, because college students will continue to buy their beer and flaccid fries as long as ASU is there.  Ah well. We can't all have as refined taste as I.  OK, as long as I'm in pretentious snob mode, I'd like to point out that one of the reviews of this establishment excuses the small oyster portions because \"we're in a dessert.\" Um...stripper jumping out of a cake? Or do you really not know how to spell DESERT?  Yowza. I'm usually nicer.",

The crowd is varied and chill - not a frat boy in sight for miles. Heat lamps, twinkly lights, booths, tables, and benches; something for everyone.  They're often crazy busy and should have more waitstaff to keep things moving at times. Plus the menu is totally standard and unremarkable barfare served reasonably cheap. If you're interested in fast as lightning service at all times and an adventurous menu full of organic locally grown ingredients, RUN! But if you want to hang out with your friends under the stars and over a beer for hours on end in the coolest space ever, this is heaven.",

So, I finally arrived at Casey Moore's last night and was impressed.  This is an upgraded Irish pub/bar with a great beer selection, yummy yummy yummy crab cakes, and a cozy atmosphere.    It was Thursday night in which they have a special on Kiltlifter (sp?) and I was pretty excited.  The music was not that good.  I wish that they would have a DJ there on busy THursday nights.  That would really enhance the atmosphere and probably their people traffic as well.  I vote for a DJ on Thursday nights, heck, I have amazing music, I could just be the DJ.  I will be back very soon to try their oysters and some of the other seafood dishes and of course more beer on tap.  Seriously, you need a DJ on Thursday nights.",

Our waiter didn't ask us what we wanted to drink and just brought out cups and a pitcher of water.. He didn't even pour the water for us. Next, he ignored us and sat down watching the game. We ordered an appetizer that never came out and 30 minutes later when we got our meals I asked him about the fried pickles and he apparently never put the order in because we didn't get them until after we were all done eating and he didn't even comp them. Then there was a hair in my friends sandwich, we finally got his attention to get her a new one and he seemed annoyed at us and didn't even apologize. He made us pay for everything and when we signed our books he hovered over us to grab them when we were done, which you're not supposed to do as a server ever. In general, I would give this place 4 stars but yesterday I give it 1.",

I've done lunch here and I had the meatloaf that was on spec that day and was in love, the flavor and complementing mash potatoes and veggies were a perfect match and I'm glad I listened to my bartender. I couldn't decide because I was hungover and this meatloaf and a Harp did the trick. Hippie sandwich is also on the top of my list and will always be my go-to meal at Casey Moore's.        Patios are open and have enough room for a larger group to meet and outdoor bar that is always open during the night, serious door people though, so don't forget your ID.

It sort of reminds me of when pulp fiction came out and you either thought it was a masterpiece (I did) or just didn't get it. So maybe Casey Moore's is the dining equivalent of pulp fiction. It certainly has that sort of gritty feel to it. However, after my last lunch review I have found myself going back for lunch several times and even for a nosh on an early Sunday evening and...it is all good. On Sunday my friend ordered the curry chicken soup and it was like...wow, everything you would expect out of a curry soup and perfect with a nice salad. At lunch the service continues to be good and the food not only reasonable but it continues to taste great.  Now, I do understand that it has a bit of a different ambiance when it is busier but that that has a certain charm as well though when I really want to enjoy a good beer I find myself wondering over to Taste of Tops to experience one of their ever changing micro-brews. However, for a nice lunch in a dark bar, or hanging out at a happy hour at the end of a week with some friends, it is great for that as well.  As for the four stars..I will admit, service can be a bit slow but people...learn to catch the eye of your server! Consider it a wonderful opportunity for some training in dining assertiveness and then just enjoy the vibe.",

    "text": "I was invited to this Irish pub for a group gathering and was pleasantly surprised by their menu full of seafood items. The interior included an enclosed outdoor patio full of ]tables and benches followed by a smaller dining interior. The atmosphere on that evening was hipsterish, very chill, with a college crowd at every turn.  It was a nice place for people watching and to spend time with friends.   I had the Blue Point Oysters ($7/half dozen) and the oysters were fresh, tasty, and meatier than those at Crab Factory. I can eat these all day long. Highly recommend it.  The Grilled Salmon ($19) came with a good size salmon and a mix of sauteed vegetables. The salmon was blackened without the skin, on the dry side, and the mix of sauteed veggies needed salt and seasoning. This dish was too bland for my preference, I won't be ordering this again.  I also had the opportunity sample their appetizers and particularly enjoyed the Deep Fried Mushrooms and Zucchini ($8) and Mozzarella Sticks ($6). They were fried to perfection, addictive, and good for sharing.   Service was limited to ordering, bringing food to our table, and bringing the check. Parking is plentiful for a location so close to campus. I hope to come back for the oysters and items such as the Steamed Clams and Shrimp Cocktails.",

It took forever to get anything from here (food and drinks and bills). When got the bill it was just the total written on a piece of paper with nothing else on their (it totaled out to $69) so asked her to re do the check with write out, which agian was just hand written but then the bill total was $67. This was the worse experience from a waitress ever!! The waitress name was Alex.",

We ordered oyster shooters without quite realizing what they were; they definitely aren't for the faint of heart! Peppered vodka, horseradish, cocktail sauce, and two oysters all served in an 8 ounce cup. I actually enjoyed it, but I can't say the same for one of the girls who took it.  I got the Oysters Rockefeller this time around and they were amazing! I stole a couple raw oysters from my friends too, and walked away thoroughly impressed.

What I did do was look up dog friendly restaurants, drive out to the place with my dog, then get told at the door that dogs aren't allowed after five.  I don't have the slightest idea what reason there could be for a dog curfew, (do dogs magically become a greater liability after five?) but every place I've ever been that claimed online to allow dogs, actually allows dogs during business hours. For this restaurant to advertise as dog friendly is a half truth. And in a state where it's literally illegal to leave your dog in a hot car, it's an immense inconvenience to get there and have nothing to do but turn around, go home, and order Chinese.",

Now, 25 years later, I go at least 2 or 3 times a week, either alone, with friend or on a date. I have a lot of friends in the area and I always run into someone I know. The giant patio has great shade in the daytime and is perfect for meeting with large groups (there are some tables that can hold 8 people). I have made friends with a couple servers because they are just awesome people, and I always have great service here. The oysters are really delicious and the food is pretty good for bar food, but a lot of it is fried so its not really healthy. The best part? Even though it is SUPER close to mill ave and ASU it never seems to get to that out-of-hand, party atmosphere but maintains the neighborhood feel with a great mix of people.",

It was a bit chilly and sunny so we opted for outdoor seating. The team there quickly lit TWO heaters to help keep us warm. Some ordered food but I only ordered drinks only. I had two Bloody Marys and probably should have only had one. It was pretty strong. The first one was spicy and had a good kick. I ordered a second but asked for one not as spicy. It was equally as good.   We din't feel rushed even though were were there a couple of hours. Service was great and I hardly noticed that my check was delivered, picked up, and put back down for my signature without my noticing. In my mind this equates to superior service. Servers are unobtrusive and professional.   The only downfall is the outdoor smoking. Smokers can smoke anywhere outdoors so if you're there, you are apt to get whiffs of smoke as you dine. Not much of an issue for me but it could be for your companions. Just take note.   I plan to go back and try some of the yummy appetizers that my friends enjoyed. Bring on the calamari!",

Outside there is more seating, but the weather can make that unusable.  The prices are good. The staff is nice. You feel comfortable and relaxed. I would not come here often if I lived in the area, but from time to time it would make for a fun afternoon.  There are some televisions so you can catch a game while enjoying a few drinks with friends. There is parking on two sides of the building.  We did not eat here. The menu is what you would expect from a bar or pub. Plenty of options for a casual meal or appetizers with friends.",

    "text": "For us, this turned out to be a \"come for the seafood, stay for the ______\" situation.  It seemed counter intuitive to come all the way to Tempe for seafood but it sounded good so we came.  This was a REALLY cool place...somewhere I'd probably really like to be all the time. I don't know what it looks like in the morning but at night, with the lights and trees, it was enchanting. Just picture a warm, balmy evening, sipping on a beer with a date or, really anyone.  The challenge is not to fall in love right then and there.  Everyone was really nice and friendly.  We spotted a few servers (including ours) sitting down with patrons but service didn't suffer.  We were given the space we needed to relax and enjoy ourselves and the food came out in a timely fashion.  The fresh oysters hit the spot except they didn't detach the muscle holding the oyster to the shell.  We figure that out pretty quickly when we slurped a mouthful of air/cocktail sauce on our first round, the bivalve itself still stuck to the shell, sans sauce.  The clam chowder was too thick for my taste, and husband commented too floury.  There was a good amount of clam chunks in it, though.  Escargot...I get this dish everywhere I go.  Unfortunately, the snails that night were gamey.  REALLY gamey.  The sauce was fantastic but I couldn't get on board with the snails.  I also had a few hard pieces (shell?) in the snails, too.  That was a first for me.  The oysters rockafeller were pretty good but rich.  I recommend just sharing a half a dozen with someone else...not choke down the dozen hubby and I did.    Finally, the salad. There was nary a sight of seafood on this thing but it was one of the top two dishes we ordered that night. Everything was fresh and the abundance of cheese made it amazing. I felt bad having mocked hubby for ordering this.  I take it back!  Anyway, we're sure to return on our next trip to spring training.  I'm in love!",

    "text": "We came here on a Monday night at around 6:30pm and got seated right away. This restaurant is a couple blocks from the ASU campus so there's a good chance you'll see a lot of students here or in the area. There's a parking lot right in front of the restaurant.  We came here mainly for their oysters because we'd heard a lot about this place and wanted to try them out. There's mostly outdoor seating; I don't know if there's indoor seating. You might want to bring a light jacket just in case it's a little chilly when you go. This place is dog friendly which is awesome! We saw a lot of furry friends walking around and hanging out.  They have $2 off select appetizers during their happy hour but no other specials for other dishes. The prices below are non-happy hour prices.  OYSTERS (half dozen $9; full dozen $14) - The oysters were not bad. They were not as meaty as I'd hoped, but they were pretty good. 4/5  CASEY'S CHICKEN WINGS ($10) - They have different flavor options: chipotle, BBQ, teriyaki, and Buffalo style. We ordered the chipotle which was good. 4/5  ESCARGOT ($10) - The escargot themselves were okay, but I really liked the mushroom sauce that it came with. It was especially delicious soaking the bread in it. 3/5  Another interesting find is the men's restroom is essentially an open waterfall/pool. There's not much privacy so if you're not into that, you might want to use the restroom before coming here or holding it in until after.",

This is not a real Irish Pub for St Patrick's Day. Not one Irish bartender, like the ones I've been to in NYC.!It is a place where hipsters and drunk college kids congregate.   Ordered shucked oysters-probably the worst I've ever had... EVER. There were seashell bits in in every bite. I had to pick fragments of it from my mouth in between a squishy, dead sea creature. Kind of takes the pleasure out of oyster slurping.   Fried mushrooms were just slimy mushrooms in the center of a deep fried breading, zero flavor served with watered down ranch.   The burger my husband ordered was tasteless and pink on the inside. He loves burgers, I don't think I've ever seen him stop halfway and not finish eating a burger, but I guess there's a first for everything.   I ordered fish and chips, which was the only decent thing. Granted I had to add salt and pepper to my entire plate to give it flavor, as it was bland. It came with coleslaw, which was a joke. Took one bite and said nah.   This place gets 5 stars for service. Our server and the hostess were incredibly attentive and sweet, even on a crazy holiday with rambunctious patrons. If I ever go back, it'd be for the cheap beer, but not the food.",

They have some of the best onion soup I have ever had. The kitchen will not disappoint. It's also a great spot to have a Guinness on draft or try a new beer as the selection inside is plentiful. If you want to enjoy dinner with the family, no problem as they have a restaurant in addition to the indoor and outside bar. They also have a great happy hour and if you have a late night craving, the kitchen is open until 1am. Most of the staff have been there from 12 to 20 years and so each time I go there it's like home.",

We ordered a dozen oysters, escargot, and chipotle wings. Most of the drinks consisted of beer which wasn't my thing but they did give me a sample of their cider.   For me, the oysters were good considering we were in a dessert area as opposed to sitting seaside. The escargot sauce was delicious but the snails themselves were not. The chipotle wings had a mild kick to them however they were on the smaller side.   All in all, it was a good place to go if you're looking for a place to hang out with friends with cheap food and beer.",

Not the worse food, but not sure worth all the accolades on here.  However, wait staff was super friendly and they took really great care of us.

    "text": "I ran across a note from 2 years ago about a great Irish Oyster Pub in Tempe. As we pulled in the parking lot, we worried about finding a spot but there's plenty of parking! We went inside for lunch instead of the patio, & first off my husband saw the dart board! He definitely enjoys the darts! Then we ordered two beers & discussed the great little pub we didn't know about for years! What a charming, warm & unique place to enjoy a few hours! The food was served quickly, & we enjoyed the oysters, beers, soup, etc very much! It is on our radar now as a great place to go for a delicious meal & a pleasant time!!",

It is like the back yard that I want but am too lazy and cheap to have.   A fire tables, pic nick tables, coy pod with waterfall, outdoor bar and the most unique men's bathroom anyway, more on that later.   As the name would imply there is a Irish theme, and they do have oysters in addition to other standard bar food fare. The food is nothing to brag about.   There is a decent parking lot however this place is popular and you may need to find a spot on a near by block. note go 1 block south to avoid being ticked as the restrictions change.   The outdoor men's bathroom known as the \"blarney stone\" is great. There is a motion activated waterfall, just unzip your full and donate your beer back to the bar in the most zen fashion available.",

Such a great compromise... you are still right around Mill Ave and if you are an ASU student this is quite convenient.  However, Casey's is not part of the typical 'Mill Ave' meat-market scene.  Always is a whole slew of people from old timers, to angstful hipster, to stoic gothic, to average joe.    Drinks are reasonably price with a great late night happy hour.  Food is fantastic... the oysters really live up to the name 'Casey Moore's Oyster House'... besides they are supposed to be an aphrodisiac so bring your dates ;)    Lots of outdoor seating (picnic benches) so you can cram people at tables.  The interior is as divey as you are going to get in Tempe ... so I'll take it.   Only downside is unreliable service.. its been quite hit or miss as far as the bartenders go... but the bouncers/ID checkers are undoubtedly hilarious everytime!",

Great food, especially for dinner.  Service is lack-luster, but adequate.  Excellent beer and booze selection.  Attitudes, tattoos and haircuts galore, but in a good way.  I'd ramble on, but you can read the other reviews to hear more,  especially if you're in the mood for some wimpy nerds to complain about how they had their IDs scrutinized, or it was so packed they had to stand.  Casey's is one of the best spots in town to get lunch and a beer, or just a beer, and sit on the patio when the weather is nice.  Bring some friends, have fun.",

You'll have to walk in, through and around the crowds to find your niche conversation with authentic, real minds ready to have an open talk with you.  It takes a few moments to filter through the fake characters that are just there to be furniture in the scenery.   Topics on music festivals, your area of study, occupations, place of origin, vacation spots, existentialism, viewpoints on abortion, immigration, drug policy, healthcare and student loans all ran the gambit of speech. Each person giving their opinion, respectfully, for logical scrutiny, which is all fine and dandy for a prospering democracy.  The bartenders in the outside bar were a bit half-ass, trying to pose for the camera, figuratively speaking of course, so I didn't bother tipping them, since I'm use to Austin bartenders who hustle to get you your drink to earn that tip.    For Phoenix ,it seems like one of the top places to drink, potentially, with progressive, liberal, art-minded people.",

Reminded me of a few of my favorite spots back home on The Hill.  Pros:  -Yummy Seafood selection.  -Plenty of choices for people of all food preferences- meat lovers, pescatarians, vegans, etc. I'd recommend the Caim Chowder, the Hippie Sandwich (YUM!), and the Hummus platter is a great share along with the Calamari. In Arizona good quality Calamari has proved to be hard to come by, but not here!  - My favorite characteristic about this place is the resident kitty that you can find lounging around no matter the size of the crowd :)  - One of the most diverse crowds of people i've seen at one place in Arizona.  - Friendly people and staff; if ever a busy night people will gladly share a table with you. Always made a new friend :)  Cons:  -Staff can be a bit impatient with placing orders and at times I've had to go up to the bar from my table to order drinks because the waiter didn't come by and check up for over 20mins...  Other than that, its a great place to go if you want to meet some kick ass people and avoid the drama of mill and sky rocket prices of old town.",

I have eaten in the private room upstairs and in the normal dining area and both are treats. The Bloody Mary they have is made with beef bouillon and may be the best one I've ever had. The fish is fresh and everything is clear to me that it is made with care and passion.

    "text": "Hmmm I have some mixed feelings about Casey Moore's. The place is always packed so it's definitely a popular spot. I used to come here all the time back in the college days. This time I came here on a busy weekend night around 8 pm for dinner and drinks. There isn't really a system for getting any kind of table so you have to fend for yourself. We were able to get a spot but waiting for a waitress to come took a while. Like I said it was busy but maybe they just need more staff or something. Once we had our server everything was great! We (ok maybe just I) ordered way too much food. I got the scampi shrimp boat, a dozen oysters, and escargot. You get a ton of escargot, not just the six that you normally get in the dish. The size of the shrimp boat was generous as well. Everything was perfectly cooked and the garlic bread was awesome for dipping in the extra garlic butter. The oysters were just ok. I feel like a place that has oyster in the name should have an actual selection of different oysters and they should be served detached from the shell. They didn't have a ton of flavor either so that was a bummer. We ordered oyster shooters as well which was a huge mistake. I don't know what I was expecting but the giant oyster, mix of tomato (?) juice, and the world's cheapest vodka was not pleasant at all.   Casey Moore's definitely caters to the college drinking crowd, especially on the weekends. So I would recommend if you're coming in for dinner to do it on a quieter night where there's hopefully a bit more organization. Also, if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke the patio is not for you. Everyone around us was smoking it makes for an unpleasant dining environment.",

So far none of them lives up to my expectations. This place.... Is a different story.   This place wasn't far from our hotel when I looked up restaurants on yelp, and as soon as we drove up, I saw the hanging lights and from then, I already knew I was gonna like it inside.   As we approached the entrance, there was a security guard checking ID's, so I'm guessing it's not kid friendly, which is fine. As we walked inside, I immediately had good vibes with the atmosphere there. Loved the \"backyard\" type feel with the twinkle lighting hanging from really nice tarps, but yet not fully covered so we can still see the stars in the sky, and had lights all over. Tables were like oversized wooden picnic booths like you were in your backyard.   Food wise, well everything we had ordered was amazingly delicious. Started with a dozen of fresh oysters for $13 which was AMAZING. They were the perfect size, came with plenty of lemon, horseradish, cocktail sauce and crackers. Oysters were again amazing, I still can't stop thinking about how yummy they were.   Ordered fried pickle spears with Ranch for $6. AMAZING. The pickles were super juicy and the batter was perfect. I know I keep Saying \"amazing\" but me when I say it's amazing, it's because they really are.   Hubby ordered build your own burger, came with the works, added cheese, sauteed mushrooms which by the way were sooooo flavorful and mouthwatering, the beef patty was perfectly cooked to his ordering and again flavorful, also came with yummy loaded fries.   Too bad we were full because otherwise, since all the item we ordered were all so yummy, we couldn't wait to try the others. This place is by far our favorite spot to go to even after years of trying out other places from Az. If you're reading this and you don't try this place. I'm telling you right now. YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON SOME GOOD ASS FOOD.",

Went in on \"black Friday\" and it was a nice respite from the shopping. We found a place to sit down, and even though my wife picked a table far away from the service station, Alyssa (sorry if the spelling is wrong) greeted us quickly and was super-sweet.  The steamed clams took longer than expected- we probably waited 30 minutes for something that cooks in 3 minutes- but still, they were tender and tasty. Garlic bread is fantastic in this place.  Also had the \"shrimp boat\" with spicy cajun sauce. Honestly, it was killer. I will definitely order that again. Just the right amount of \"hot.\"  This place really focuses on beer. If I were twenty years younger and could still drink beer, I would be at this place all the time- five stars. If they put as much focus on the kitchen as they did the beer selection, the restaurant would be better.  Service and beer are their best qualities though. Stay for the food, while you are sitting there.",

The waiter was more focused on people who ordered alcohol when my friend and I bought food and an appetizer, it's not like we were at the bar top. Takes forever for refills. We split checks and instead of printing a check for my friend and I separately he stood there for three minutes trying to split and do the math in his head. Btw my friend was charged $3 for a soda, so at that point you might as well order something with alcohol in it. We both give him our cards after this long period of mental math he did you would think he would swipe the cards right plus one is chase blue and the other was black. Well he split the checks and swiped my card for both checks.  The checks just listed the amount on them so there is no proof of what my friend or I ordered.   Honestly if the wings weren't so good I wouldn't go back. I still plan to go but if I see this waiter I will more than confidently walk out and eat somewhere else.",

Casey's is mostly outdoor patio with a small indoor area with a bar and some tables and (of course) restrooms. Much of the patio is shaded and they turn on the water misters in the summer to help cool things down.  In the winter when it gets chilly, they have plenty of heat lamps to warm it up a bit.  When they get busy on weekend nights, you may be searching for a table for a while and you may not get your drinks/food as quickly as you would like.  Be patient!  It is worth the wait.    Bathrooms are clean and well kept, as is everything else.  You will not see leftover plates of food laying around on tables or trash on the floor/ground.  Everyone does a really great job of keeping things tidy.    Four stars because I think they could hire a couple more servers for busy times so that no one is overwhelmed with too many tables.  Other than that, this is my regular watering hole and will continue to be as long as I'm living in the Phoenix area!",

I believe you can request to dine in the room where the ghost supposedly are.  The food. My favorite thing to get for lunch is the hamburger or the blackened salmon.  This time I got the salmon. For happy hour, my go-to is the wings. YUM!  Service is as expected but better after work. I'm sure it has to do with the manpower as I've seen the servers work a wide floor during lunch.

Unfortunately all pasterized Guiness served in America pales when compared to drinking the real unaltered deal in Ireland.  This was no exception.  The oysters were basically on point.  Fresh, briny, meaty, and delicious. A lot of shells this time.  I do not understand why their shuckers cannot not go the extra step to sever the abductor muscle before serving.  Even my bartender said \"You took your time eating those\", as she noticed I struggled with a small cocktail fork to loosen the morsel.  Side note:  their horseradish is the hottest and best I've even had.  I've had gallons of clam chowder in the Northeast in my life.  This clam chowder was totally disappointing.  Floury, floury, floury, with little cream.   Really good chunks of clam though.  But not something I will order in the future.  Good, but not quite up to the standard I normally expect from Casey's.

I can see how it's likely a popular spot for the locals. We wanted calamari and Yelp recommendations led us here. Let's just say, we were not disappointed. I totally failed on taking pictures of our food- so you'll just have to take my word on it. The calamari is sliced thick and they're huge! The basket/portion is very generous. Party of 3 and we couldn't finish it. We also tried the fried clams, which were pretty good too. I got the 'build your own burger' adding on grilled onions and mushrooms and it was delicious. I'm stuffed... so much food and overall a great meal and experience.",

While we aren't used to such big oysters, we were pleased, next time we know to order a 1/2 dozen as opposed to a full dozen.   With that being said, the service at Casey Moore's really was the best part of our visit! Such an outstanding group of people! We will definitely be back time and time again!",

My friend ordered the shrimp salad, and she liked the mix of texture of avacado with the shrimp.   My other friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries. He thought it was all pretty average. He also said his fries were soggy.   I ordered the Po' boy which was good. Everything was cooked well and the sauce was a nice tangy mix.   Overall, I liked it fine.

It would be very easy to designate 10 tables out of the 50 (at least, probably more) available as a non-smoking area for dining.   The beer list is okay and they have happy hour food specials (beer not included, there's a different one discounted each day). I ordered fried pickles (came as spears, not chips) and calamari and would not recommend either. My husband had the turkey croissant and that was good. My friend ordered the oysters which she seemed to like.  The service was attentive and pleasant but I'd have a hard time going back to the patio without any relief from cigarette smoke.",

My wife ordered the shrimp scampi and for some reason it came out with a heavy cream sauce, no complaints because it was good but it was not scampi.  Tuna was perfect I had a chance to taste it  and that cooked perfect and I did notice a co- worker leave the 1/2 of the fish and chips on there plate no a good sign.  Clam chowder was good as a few friends did say they enjoyed it.  Calamari was off the chain \"Perfect\".  The server was warm,  friendly and polite and had some great suggestions for dinner and was very patient and waited for us to have  few rounds before we ordered dinner.  The place is pretty big and it seems that if you would come and sit in a different place each time it would be like going to a different place.  Music was jamming something for everyone. Folks were friendly and the place was packed.     Now, cleanliness it  seems like it could use a wipe down, moping an a power wash in a few spots but I guess after a few cold ones you don't see it anymore.  Will I go back?  Yes, I would, affordable food, good music and  folks all in a good mood I'm there.  4 stars due to they are still a littler ruff around the edges.  Peace :)",

Fridays & Saturdays there are just way too many people. I usually order whatever's on special, most of the times when I go it happens to be Kilt Lifter. Good beer. Service is not so great, never has been for me. Even dining there (inside) wasnt outstanding service. Although, the food was good. I cant remember what I even had since I rarely order food there. Try to go upstairs, I did once and no one was up there.. it was kind of creepy. Not too sure of the whole \"haunted\" thing, but it adds to the bar's charm.  I do like this bar, a lot of my friends are regulars and mostly can be found there on any given day. I do like the type of crowd that goes to Casey's, at least on the nights I've been. The place would be a hell of a lot better if they somehow found a way to expand because I literally get claustrophobic on the busier nights. In an bar thats outdoors that just seems odd. lol. Also, the parking situation sucks.. the ratio of parking spots to bar goers is not proportionate.   Overall, I'm sure I'll be back many a time, since its a cool place to just hang out with your friends at.",

    "text": "I have enjoyed some tasty food here in the past, but I won't be stepping foot in here again.  One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as \"G\", decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.    So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, \"What if I was a transgender person?\" To which this guy replied \"Well then you can get out.\"  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the \"N\" word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.  It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated.",

    "text": "Ok, We are from Tucson ,was in Phoenix for daughter's birthday ,look for a place with seafood for birthday dinner. First off we hit the Tempe area around 5 o'clock not a good idea, stop and go all the way, but it did give me a chance to see the ASU area very cool looking university! We found Casey's and was totally surprise to see that it was a casual bar with outdoor sitting. Not what daughter review on web which gives you no clue they are a collage hang-out! . Not that we have a problem with that ,we were expecting a nice restaurant. Place wasn't real busy yet ,so plenty of choices at all the dirty tables. Once we sat down we waited 10 minutes for someone to notice and as busy as the bartender was he made his way over our way. Server did finally come with menu and yes there was a lot of oysters, clams and seafood choices . Plus there!. We gave our order which I ended up not getting the seafood .I chose cabbage and corn beef, BIG mistake! The corn beef was good, but the cabbage, potato and carrots were the worst I have had ever!.Bland ,under cooked, tasteless! How do you do that to something so simple? Daughter and partner had clams and fish tacos which both found to be really good. i tasted my daughter's fried clams and I was impress. Wish it had been my choice! Then storm blew in and we had to move to better table to stay dry. The wait guys were great in helping since my daughter's partner had a walker. Then no sign of them, no refills on drinks,and Ii had to go find our server, who was no where in sight so one of the guys got my check. Would we go back ,I only know I  wouldn't.",

We got there after 6:30, hoping to grab a table or seats at the bar & make our orders quickly before HH ends at 7.  Well of course the bar seats & every table was taken.  All of the waiters/waitresses seemed so rushed & overwhelmed.  We finally found the hostess & asked for a table for three.  As she went off to look for a table, another hostess came up to us.  I specifically stated that we were there for HAPPY HOUR.  And she was like WELL ARE YOU EATING?  I had to make this point twice.  Then the first hostess came back & said she could seat us upstairs (I didn't even know they had a second floor!).  Well, bad idea.  First, the decor upstairs was a lame attempt at making the Oyster House look the least bit classy.  Then, the waitress told us happy hour is only available downstairs.  Wow.  After a second look for an available table downstairs, we decided to just stay on the second floor & pay the regular price for oysters ($12 per dozen versus $10 per dozen during HH).  The service upstairs was super slow.  The waitress wasn't even paying close attention when we made our orders because she definitely forgot my friend's beer.  The good thing was she comped it since he waited for like over half an hour.  The oysters tasted extra fishy that day, not like the first time I tried them here.  I lost my appetite for anything else after that.  My boyfriend's solution to the fishy-ness: mask the taste with horseradish & lots of Tabasco!",

    "text": "I know how this place gets 4/5 stars: atmosphere. Somehow, with the disgusting 2-stall girls' restroom, no parking, high bar prices, no good waitresses, and pint-only beer options, this place maintains it's hipster popularity as \"the place\" to be in downtown Tempe.   I honestly do not know why I go, but I say yes when my friends decide to invite me here. The only reason why I give it two stars is because of the ability to be a hot spot when everything on Mill is dying. This is due to sheer lack-of-caring about their customers, which college attendees and awkward single older men inside seem to be drawn to.   Last time, the lack of caring was what threw me over the edge. I was waiting at the bar and I was almost next! So excited to finally pay over $4 for a pint of beer (which was their happy hour special), when a guy moved to the right of me and started up a conversation with the bartender. He obviously knew him, and the conversation continued, without the bartender helping anyone, for at least 4-5 minutes. I finally said to a waitress, \"Can I get a drink or is this bartender just going to ignore me?\" She replied, \"Oh, these guys can talk all night. That's just how our bartenders are!\"  You'd think by how much money Casey's is making, they'd improve their restrooms. One girls' restroom with only two toilets for a packed-bar is just unsanitary at the end of most nights.    My husband says the oysters are good and fresh, but that's no reason to go back for us.   I am no whiney-40 year old- I'm an ASU student who does love the college bar scene- I just wish Casey's would take better care of the people who keep them in business.",

Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.  When I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy).   It gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!  The oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you. I had never tried oysters before going to Casey's but they are surprisingly tasty and comparatively better than other oyster houses.  If you're feeling pretty ballsy, go pee on the Blarney Stone!

Time between drinks was minimal- and it was a Saturday night! 3.  A photo hunt machine (it was raining the night we came so we hung out inside, not on the patio).",

It's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20+ years that I have been a patron...even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent.  Casey Moore's Oyster House patio was the spot one of my instructors selected for the lecture portion of his class.  Every Tuesday, from 2-3:30 PM, we sat at a table and discussed designing costumes/lights/sets/sound for ASU theatre productions.  Between the munchies and the black and tans, our discussions became quite animated and we certainly considered more creative design concepts.  It was quite cool to be able to have class and a beer (or 3) at the same time.  Fast-forward from 1989 (my first experience at Casey Moore's) to 2011 (my return to Tempe for work).  The food is still outstanding, the location is easily accessable, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  The prices, unfortunately, are a bit higher than other places.",

You just walk in to a Hipster bar and for a first time guest it takes you off guard. We entered through the side door and it took us a few minutes just to figure out there was inside seating to this place. It's just not very welcoming. It's hard to put the ambiance in to words. After we made our way around and found the inside bar we became more comfortable. The drinks and food are reasonably priced. The oysters were really good and only $13 for a dozen. I'd love to come back for the oysters, which we may decide to do earlier in the day. This is just simply not our scene for the night time crowd. Also, I know it's a bar and all but dude's... That bathroom was disgusting!",

Our server was vibrant (literally - with purple hair and purple fingernails) and very friendly, we enjoyed her a lot. We ordered the blackened salmon Caesar salad and it was perfect. Juicy tender salmon with lots of blackened seasoning. The dressing was VERY good, not your average grocery store Caesar. Our friends had the fish and chips, the turkey crossaint, and the blackened salmon berry salad. Great reviews all around. The berries were amazing. The clam chowder was also very good.  Decent beer list as well and very reasonable prices - something like $3.50 for a pint of a good IPA or a Blue Moon.  It wasn't even Happy Hour!  Definitely looking forward to returning.  Only complaint is the same with many venues around Phoenix: the patio was way too smokey to even consider sitting out there.",

After I picked up a friend from the airport, we headed straight here and ate their oysters a dozen for $12 ($1/oyster). Its a pretty good deal considering at most places that's happy hour prices! Oysters are fresh and taste best with horse radish added on top! The only thing that would make this even better is making your own oyster sauce out of lemons, lime, sugar, etc. We also ordered their Fish sandwich which was titled the \"Best in Town!\". However, I thought it was just A-OK. I'd definitely come back for their oysters though! The ambiance is awesome. People wearing whatever they want and a very causal place. Their lights on the trees and on the open patio is a nice touch.",

    "text": "Words cannot even express how much I hate this place. It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.  Visit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.  Visit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.  Visit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?  Visit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \"I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \"There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\" \"We don't.\" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \"No, I told you we don't.\" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.  I mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me. I smile big, say hello, don't take too much of their time, don't whine or complain, etc. But the fact that four of my all time worst restaurant experiences were all from Casey Moore's is just too much to ignore. I hate that place and hate that I'm the only one who feels this way.",

Unfortunately on two separate occasions, the waiters gave themselves a tip that I did not authorize. On the first occasion, I paid with cash and the waitress did not give me back my full amount of change until I had to awkwardly mention it. On the second time, I decided to pay with my card to avoid any confusion. I paid with my card and left a cash tip. The waiter added an additional tip onto my receipt which I just noticed on my credit card statement. I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone disputing the charge which was a waste of my time. Disappointing, not sure how to pay there without getting duped somehow.",

It's a great little hang out for the college scene. Very close for those on the west side of campus, so close a group of us sometimes heads over between classes or at the end of a rough day to grab a drink and some grease.   So needless to say I have had a few of the items on the menu however, I haven't found something I really, really like. I've had the tuna bacon melt (overkill-too much grease), fries (yum, they put a sprinkle of parmesan), fried clams (good), turkey croissant (okay), zucchinis and mushrooms (good).   I think the patio really makes this place great. It is fun and welcoming. You could hang out here all day (in great weather that is).  They allow smoking, kinda sucks, but most people are respectful and blow up rather than at you. If you go during peak hours (weekends/nights) you might not be able to get a table as most people make a looooooong night of Casey's and usually stay put. Cheers!!!",

The server was nice and service was quick.    My family and I have been there numerous times in the past with no issues of having my family member under 21.  For some reason this time was different.  I tried flagging down my family as they were walking into the bar.  Apparently the door man has said the only way a minor is allowed in is to sit inside, not on the patio.  Again, this is 100% different than the other ten times we have been there during the week.  When I went inside to find out what was going on, I over heard the server saying \"they should go somewhere else, like I care anyway.\"  Wow, that was super rude.  I don't think she knew I was standing there.  Regardless, it was one of the worst customer service experiences I've had.  The worst part is the family is full of restaurant managers and servers.  We all have been in situations like this, which is why we don't put up much of a fight.    Now, if the business policy is no minors under 21 are allowed ever, I can understand if they made an exception one time. However, as I've previously stated, we have been there over ten times with no issues.     I gave 2 stars for the beginning server being nice and speedy.  But I cannot go above that because the rude comments and extremely uncalled for glare we received has pushed me away from this place to never return.  So much so, this is my first negative post ever on Yelp.",

I didn't realize that I was somewhat \"yelling\" to have a conversation with my friends there until I woke up at my buddies after leaving tore up from their delicious white chocolate beer and he said that my sore throat was from talking so loud to be heard.  Yes, the deducing agent would be that his throat was sore as well.  I'll definitely be back, although next time, less white chocolate beer.  Man is my body just aching today!",

    "text": "Yelp was created for establishments such as Casey Moore's.  For months I had been looking forward to dining at this place, since laying eyes on an invitation to take place here. So, needless to say, after a doctor's appointment located a few blocks away, I jumped on the opportunity to eat some Oysters Rockafeller.  When I arrived, I thought the outer appearance of the establishment was quaint, quirky and certainly unique. The \"casual\" vibe screams out to you, as if anything other than flip flops and a tan are overdressing.   Once I opened the doors, I found the inside to be completely dark and drab.... sort of like Cheers Neighborhood Bar's illegitimate cousin. The bartender looked up but failed to greet us because his current conversation was more important. We then seated ourselves and the hostess came by 2 minutes later only to say \"You need some menus or something?\" We of course said yes and she proceeded to retrieve them.   The waiter was prompt and pretty pleasant. I was a little disappointed that after we ordered our drinks and food, we found out that happy hour was in a couple minutes. That would have been nice to know!   I will say that we were thoroughly entertained by the patrons of the pub as we waited for our food. The bartender drank while on the clock and one guy continued to throw the F bomb and other four letter words. And to my surprise he let us know that women have vaginas and that he is currently receiving government cheese. I'm not sure why we all needed the lesson in anatomy and economics however, I didn't know whether to laugh or smack him.... lucky for him I didn't choose the latter.   My husband's food was delivered to the table 10 minutes before mine which in and of itself was rude. However, this is not the final straw for me.   THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE I must say I was reluctant to use the restroom and for good reason. On my way to the restroom in the hallway was a pungent foul order which I assumed came from the men's room because 9 times out of 10, that is the case. When I opened the door to the ladies room I found the culprit. Naturally, I thought someone had let it fly in there, sadly I was sort of right. One stall had toilet paper all over the floor and seat so I went to the other and the sight will FOREVER haunt me. The toilet was not only filled with poo but some was smeared on the front. There is no way that all of that came from one person and if the \"regular\" culprit felt it was not necessary to flush, why should I for them? I held my water, washed my hands for fear of catching anything by way of touching knobs and hurried out of there only to find my Oysters Rockerfeller waiting for me at the table.... as if I wanted to eat after that site.   The only reason this place even gets one star is because the waiter comped a beer from our tab... I think he felt bad for us. LOL   My husband and I vowed to never return and I think I will take the advice of a previous commenter, Mark S. and try the House of Tricks down the road. So long Casey Moore's.",

    "text": "Reading through the massive number of reviews that Casey's gets, lots of people have a great time here and some people have unfortunately had a terrible time and depending on which night you go, each scenario is a possibility.  Most often, when coming here, I've had a pretty good time, even when it so crowded you can't sit down and your elbows are literally touching like the back of a stranger.  I like to come in the afternoon or on an off-night like Wednesday night (it is Wednesday, so I may partake).  Their selection of beers isn't staggering or anything, but the food there is actually pretty damn decent and they have a fair number of appetizers to choose from that aren't too heavy.  Like I said, sometimes I've been here on days where it's totally bullshit.  I remember I came here once with my girlfriend at the time and we literally didn't get served for about thirty minutes.  I would've bailed but it was her first time there so I was like, \"We're gonna do this shit.\"  The same waitress who took her sweet-ass time spent maybe like three seconds talking to and then on her way to get our beers, she stopped at a table with these dudes with British accents and giggled and slapped her knee and sat there for like maybe five minutes.  I was like, \"Oh, great... our waitress is a whore for accents and two dudes with British accents are here.  We're fucked.\"  Yes, I admit, the English are quite charming, quite, but sonofabitch, man.   For like the longest time, that waitress would always be there when I was there and no matter where I sat, it was her section.  And there she was, takin' forever and lookin' mad at me.  Haven't seen her there in forever so I've lucked out.  You know, it's easy to complain, but most often I've had a really good time.  I love the atmosphere outside, the misters in the summer and sipping on a hot coffee in the winter.  All year round, it's fucking awesome to be there.  I love sitting by the koi pond, sipping on a beer and watching the fish go by.  It's a relaxing place when it wants to be and a fuckin' madhouse when the time arises.  It's one of the best landmarks we have in Tempe.",

    "text": "i guess my new thing will just be writing reviews about all the shitty bouncers at bars in tempe.  back on st. patrick's day i was going into casey moores and as i was locking up my bike as i watched a bouncer beat up an innocent drunk guy, who was already out of the bar and on the sidewalk trying to leave. he was pushing the guy telling him to leave but pretty much wasn't letting him leave by grabbing his shirt and throwing him around. the drunk guy kept saying \"i'm trying to leave, stop touching me!\" the bouncer ended up throwing the guy against a car and punching him while he was on the road. then he dragged him onto the side walk and held his head by the hair and started hitting his head on the sidewalk. the bouncer was bleeding from the hand and when he noticed he started saying \"you bit me, omg i you bit me! i love putting people in jail. you're going to jail\" once the cops showed up they wanted my story since i was a witness. me and two other people gave the police our story. once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite. probably cut it while beating the guy up.  anyway, i went into the bar to get a drink and i was told to leave because i talked to the cops. i guess the managers really support a roided up bouncer beating up an innocent drunk guy. SO fast forward 3-ish months and i go back to casey moores with some friends. i was there last night and GREAT the same bouncer is surprisingly still working there. when the night ended i was outside the bar in the parking lot and the bouncer comes up to me and whispers \"if you fcking tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here\" and i respond with \"what??\" and he says it again \"you heard me. if you tell anyone about what happened you're not allowed back here. you're on a list you know\" and then went into the bar. i hear the bouncer get crazy in the bar and start yelling and gathering staff and is talking and pointing at me. so i just stand there and wave.  also great idea to make a scene like that in front of a parking lot full of people if you don't want me telling anyone.  sorry bouncer. i told the internet about how shitty you are. maybe have some respect for people and talk to people nicely.  i'm not sure what else to say but i wanted to tell my story about 2/5 of my experiences of ever going there. i'm fine with not being let back in, especially if they're going to keep staff like this around.  BESIDES these incidents i've had good experiences here and the other staff is awesome. nice nice people.  *the bouncer who did this was a Caucasian, short stalky guy kinda chubby, short brown hair, has a scruffy beard, usually has a backward baseball cap on.",

If you are an oyster fan, the Oysters Rockefeller are EXCELLENT! I find myself making excuses to stop by for an afternoon beer and rocks whenever I can.  Busy weekend nights offer a different experience, but no less unique.  Don your beard, fake glasses, and dirtiest flannel and join the fun. Never a dull moment and always good conversation to be had.

Fast forward to last week.  I FINALLY got around to reconciling my bank account and realized (unbeknownst to me) that Casey Moore's charged my debit card $62.00.  $28.50+$5.00 +$28.50=$62.00.  What????!!!!!  I know it's been over 6 months, but still... who gets a $33.50 tip on a $28.50 meal?  I realize it was probably an honest mistake, and I realize that I should have caught the error in March.  But as a fellow small business owner (retail/restaurant) I had fallen behind in my accounting duties.  I still had the receipt and the bank statement which I was quite willing to show them in order to have the error corrected.  I spoke with one of the owners and she was so gracious.  Today I received a check in the mail to correct the error.  Ask me what I ate at Casey Moores.  Ask me how it tasted.  I couldn't tell you.  But what I can tell you is that the owner made me happy, realized the mistake, made me whole and was extremely nice and apologetic for it.  And that I will remember FOREVER!  Thank you Patricia, I sure appreciate the customer service and integrity!",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars I absolutely would.  First, we walked into a huge SMOKING patio trying to figure our where the non-smoking area was. It was horrifically smokey and there were no non-smoking patio. Then, we cannot figure out where the hostess is only to figure it out after asking the bartender who advised this unusually dressed guy who was sitting up against the wall drinking a pop.  He seats us.  The actual hostess walks up to us to tell us that she wasn't ready for us to sit as she wasn't done preparing the table. We advised her that the hostess seated us and she argued that she was the hostess.  Moving forward we get out waiter who ultimately took our order.  My boyfriend orders a chowder and we both get one. I tell the waiter I did not order a chowder. He argued that he was 'positive' that I did.  I don't eat chowder so I assured him I didn't.  Btw, chowder, according to my boyfriend was terrible.   I order oysters that were literally warm and had unusual black things in them and we thought they were bad so didn't finish.  I order the steak with brandy sauce. Sauce was literally cold and although the steak was good, it was barely warm.  Also, I didn't get butter for my potato and didn't see the waiter for at least ten minutes so I was done.  I asked them to remove the steak as I was done. My boyfriend got the oyster shooter and saiid it was literally the worst thing he had ever eaten in his life. We got the bill and it was an old freakin' fashion tab that you couldn't tell what you were paying for and what you were not paying for.  We paid and left.  Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.",

I always get steamed clams at seafood bar places... first time I've seen a place ration their tiny clams. A dozen tiny clams... usually it's 2 to 3 dozen, but that's on the east/west coast... the sauce is very generic. Taste is bland. The best part of this dish was the garlic bread. It was above average. Usually the bread and sauce are supposed to go great together... in this case, it made the garlic bread go from above average to below average. It lost its taste after it's dipped. *sigh* Rockerfeller oyster... should be called spinach and bacon bites... oyster is buried in the spinach and bacon bits. You taste all spinach, no oyster. Maybe my standards are too high due to living near great lakes, NJ, and california... But I had high hopes for this place even though it's the furnice. Please do better with your food, I enjoy the atmosphere and the service is great... But your food is very disappointing...",

Great spot whose ambience takes you to far away places like the British Isles with their wood floored and brick walled establishment. It was pretty quiet for a Friday lunch time, but I could see the bar area got packed as this place probably JUMPS from happy hour to closing with their beer specials. Overall I enjoyed it and I would definitely go again. One complaint - the oyster & shrimp combo  could offer more bang for your $10.",

Also disappointing was that out of 12 oysters, only ONE was shucked.  They tasted good, but were obviously hard to eat since we had to dig them off the shell...  This place is mostly a bar with a small dining room.  The doormen checking ID were very kind in directing my under-age daughter and I to the dining room, where we enjoyed the meal. The cooked food we ordered (burger and sandwich) were good -- nothing amazing but good.    I'm guessing this place is great for happy hour and adult groups, but as an \"oyster bar\" they're lacking in actual oysters.",

The huge patio space and limited interior means that it's friendly to both smokers and non-smokers, which I think has had a large part in their popularity.  It also just seems to attract an interesting crowd, and I think that's what really makes it different.  Every bar attracts a specific average of people.  Casey Moore's tends to attract those involved in creative fields like theatre, film, music, etc.  I don't want to say this means any one thing, but it really does make the place more interesting.  If you are creatively inclined, you are far more likely to meet someone you might actually like as a human being there, and that means a lot.",

Casey's is the local pub of Tempe and has held that crown for decades.  It is where you find an eclectic crowd who are all just there to enjoy themselves.  It is where 60 something's mingle with 20 something's who have become grown up drinkers and have tired of the Mill Ave seen.  The old \"craftsman style\" house converted into a restaurant and bar are inviting, and the bartenders do remember your name. Not to be out outdone; the enormous patio is perfect for spending your afternoon day drinking and enjoying oysters on the half shell.  This would also be my choice for where to start and sometimes end your St. Patrick's Day celebration! Get there early and claim your spot because this place gets crowded early.  So if you are looking for a really chill place to just hang out and be merry with your friends Casey Moore's is hard to beat.  A couple final notes: Yes you can pee on the Blarney Stone and Yes Casey Moore's is haunted.  Enjoy!",

There are still plenty of my friends that frequent it and its like a second home almost.

The food at Casey's is good, I mostly eat the appetizers there. Lets face it i mainly go to Casey's for the friends and the drinks. it's a great neighborhood bar right next to ASU so its a big college crowd hangout when the weather is great. I have never had any issues with the staff there, so far, they have always been friendly to me and my friends even back in the day when its gotten a little \"rowdy\" the bouncers have been courteous enough to say \"hey man you guys have to go sorry, see ya next time\"  ahh the college years..",

I love the fried Zucchini and Mushrooms too, you never see that anywhere!",

Parked next to a guy who was obviously heading to class as he got out of his truck and fished around for books and backpack and walked off towards campus. So needless to say the parking sucks. When I got to the patio entrance the less than enthused door man said you cant bring your dog in. I looked around and noticed a group on the patio with two large rambunctious dogs and asked why was it ok for them. He said they were here before 5. When I asked why was it like that (again it was just a couple mins after 5pm) he said management said no dogs after 5. I promptly left. I will not be returning here. Ever.",

Perhaps this is because they don't want to disturb the neighbors, but it doesn't have to be loud....it can be a guy playing the harpsichord in the corner...I don't care. Anything. Something atmospheric would be nice. Maybe some electronica. Cos on a down night it can get really quiet out there.  Other than my phobia of taking a drunken tumble down the front steps in front of everybody I love this bar.",

Parking is rough and it's a packed house especially on a Saturday night. It has the capability to accommodate a larger group but you might have to wait around a while.  Server forgot the order and took over an hour to get a club sandwich-nothing special. If you don't mind the chain smokers and the hardly working misters and go with a group this place can be a winner for you. I'd rather hang at more low key places & not at a college hangout spot.",

What makes Caseys so special is that the staff is personable;  not in a corporate way of pretending to 'love' you, but in an honest, sometimes frank, or even humorous style.     The food is always good;  its been a rare occasion in ten plus years that I haven't be satisfied or stuffed with the goods!!   And just because we are in the desert, don't stray from the fish; I've had all sorts of goodness here; look for the specials and try something a bit diff than just wings (which are great,) or a burger (one of the best burger deals in town.)  I always try a bit of whatever dessert is being served, and the menu is also flexible as to what you desire.  Don't want fries w/ yr fish n chips? Get a cup or bowl of the delicious clam chowder.  Order a caesar salad with no croutons and some tomatos.  No big deal;  and the food is good.  I have had days where I hit up the ol' caseys for lunch, and by nightfall i come back for a late dinner. They even serve til 1am!  In tempe?  Hell yes!  Every night at caseys, especially Fri/sat, you will see an eccentric, albeit young and hip, mix of people.  As the days' regulars give way to the night,  the tattooed, loud, and sexy make their way to crowd the outside patio.  Its rare that you could feel out of place unless you are expecting yr average hooters... there is a air of unexpected joy, of raising a pint of guinness (which is poured astutely,) and of seeing and meeting old and new friends alike.",

Not a lot of places have pear cider on tap, that are also affordable ;P  By the way, a black velvet is pear cider and guinness.  Oh man that was delicious.  I could never really drink guinness on it's own, it's much too heavy for me.  But paired with that light and fruity addition...so good!  Came back Sunday afternoon so that I could try the oysters rockefeller before I headed back home.  They were just okay, not as amazing as what my friend made them out to be.  Though, I was completely surprised when my bill came and it was 8 and change.  The oysters rockefeller alone should've been 8, but to include a beer too???  So.that.must.mean. ...

I love the beautiful outdoor seating, the little pond in the corner, the hanging lights, the giant trees, the drink specials, the Guiness on draft.  I always bring out of town folks to Casey Moore's because you can order anything on the perfectly sized menu and you know it's going to be descent.  The boyfriend always orders the oysters and the price for a half dozen is solid and affordable and I don't even mind watching him slurp them down as long as I have a nice buzz from one or two Harps.   I think I've ordered every appetizer and never been disappointed.  Also, even their prices when it's NOT happy hour are super cheap, 6 bucks for a dozen wings, that's totally perfect.  The service isn't extraordinary, but I don't mind waiting since I'm fond of the ambiance and enjoy people watching amongst the interesting crowd.  The chicken strips are awesome, the salads are good and never wilted or over dressed, the fish and chips are on par, the fries are always good; you can't beat anything for the price and the atmosphere.  I've been here for my birthday, taken out of town friends here, brought my mom and brother here when they were in town, had a million happy hours here and just can't seem to find anything I hate about it.  Oh, I hate when it's hot and we can't sit outside.   Casey Moore's is charming, cheap, serves above average bar food and essentially is an all around quality bar in the middle of Tempe.",

I guess this was \"the cool spot\" when he was growing up... literally, the only cool spot... nothing like self-consciously hipsterized, bar-lined, alterna-culture Seattle, where we live now. This was a lot of fun for me.  1) I have never seen so many different kinds of bar flies in one place. In Seattle, having 10 million bars means that each one can serve its own perfectly isolated niche (e.g., bearded heavy metal knitting enthusiasts). I guess living in a town that mainly has tumbleweeds and meth to offer means that on Friday night, everybody looking to party ends up in the same place.... soccer moms, goths (really? still?), bros, and yes, hipsters, all gettin' wasty in their own corner of this sprawling bar.  2) Property is pretty cheap in AZ, I guess - this place is huge!! That was fun.  3) MMMmm I ate the hummus and pita it was delicious.  4) I can't believe how absurdly freaking cheap it is to drink in this town!! God, why'd I ever move to the Pacific Northwest? I shoulda moved to Tempe!! Oh wait... this would be the *only* place I'd ever go.",

It even has it's own wandering cats, which is pretty cool if you're a cat person.  In terms of food,it's usually been just about average. There have only been two things that have really stuck out to me, and that was the mussels and the escargot. Aside from that, I'd say the food there is generally good, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The only reason this gets a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is the service. The waiters/waitresses are generally very nice - when they drop by your table, that is. I suppose Casey's is notorious for having really absent servers, so granted, I was prepared at my first visit. Tthough I'm aware of the spotty service every time I go, it still gets frustrating having to wait ten minutes to get another drink order in.  Aside from that, check it out - just be ready to wait for a bit between drinks, or order two at a time.",

Not that I go there that often anymore. But it is a place where young and old Sun Devils, students and alumni and profs, can all unite under one roof and put back a beer or two in a laid back, charming, relaxed environment. The bartenders are friendly as they've always been. The outdoor tables have ample heatlamps during the winter months. Hanging out at the outdoor bar itself is a good time too. I happen to believe that if you come here and somehow manage to not have a good time, there's something seriously wrong with you and/or your company. Just stay away from me and we'll all be happy.",

    "text": "This is another one of those Tempe/ASU spots that seems to be very popular, and yet for the life of me, I just don't get why. It is definitely a more chilled out in terms of the environment than the majority of your options directly off Mill, but it doesn't make it any less obnoxious or overcrowded. It's just a different type of obnoxious. You won't see any shiny shirts, designer jeans, or orange spray-tanned Jersey shore trash here, instead you'll encounter an entirely different species of douche at this establishment. THE HIPSTER DOUCHE. These guys with their American Apparel deep v-neck shirts, ironic mustaches, and overly tight girl-jeans are an equally repugnant group in their own right, I truly detest them and the fixed-gear bikes they rode in on. Throw in a few random haggard chicks and white guys with dreads to represent for the \"this fad isn't over yet\" pseudo hippies, and a couple sleeve-tattoo wielding bros and that sums up the demographic that is pretty consistent at this place.   Honestly, hanging out with these people is not my idea of a good time, and therefore neither is wasting my money on drinks at Casey's. I've never tried the food, so I can't comment on that, but the drinks I had were weak. Parking is a bitch, and the cops do tend to stake out the lot towards the end of the night in hopes of generating more revenue for the city of Tempe. I only gave it a second star because the idea of this place being suppossedly haunted intrigues me.",

If you are from Tempe and have tattoos you perhaps can identify with the culture of Casey Moore's.  Weekend patio excursions are a treat in the Maple-Ash district just spitting distance to Mill Avenue. There is never really a bad time to come to this bar and I have certainly been there enough to know. Casey Moore's oysters and cheap and good. As frequently as I eat oysters I would fully endorse this bars shellfish  The clam chowder is king for a snack. You can get escargot here that is decent and there is not much on the menu that I would not recommend.  Lunch is the perfect weekend after noon in the summer with misters and giant fans  There have been times where I looked for houses with the sole purpose of being \"In the neighborhood\" More of a lifestyle choice than a restaurant..  We have laughed,.. we have cried,.. we have sometimes gotten kicked out of it. We have always come back. Casey Moore's is certainly a place that needs to be visited while in Tempe.",

Well, just for me, i suppose, since I'm new to the area and don't have friends here, yet. I have tons of work friends that drink there and never seem to see them, even with hundreds of happy drinkers. Good place to meet a chick from myspace, plenty of witnesses. It's a big, crazy house party with drunk coeds on the lawn.   But when it's that full, getting a seat at the bar can be tricky, or a table for that matter and when you don't know anyone it's more of a challenge to squeeze in. I've been told to come earlier to get inaugurated into the family, we'll see, it could happen. The staff is friendly enough and the beer selection is plentiful. Parking is interesting, they have a small lot that fills fast and theres always alot of bikes out front. With pedals. There is parking on the street and walking is not uncommon.",

It did not look like any cut of prime rib I have ever seen before, mostly fat and I really do not know what part of the cow it came from, but prime rib looks like prime rib and this piece of meat was not prime rib. The bright side of the dining experience one of the managers came over to me and said that he could tell I was not happy with the meal and that he had already comped it from my bill, and offered to get me any thing else that I wanted. I have never had that happen, I had not even complained to my wife about the meal and the manager was so intuitive he took care of it for me.

Some of their staff aren't always the most pleasant, but they get the drinks out quick and that's what counts for me here. Their patio is dog friendly before five and I think they're cool with dogs staying there as well if you end up hanging out after five. Prices are affordable but the atmosphere and the patio are the real reasons to go here.  In other news, I've gotten out of bed at like 11 pm to go get cheese sticks to go from here because I just crave them sometimes.",

The location is really cute, I love the outdoor patio and the inside feels like an authentic pub. Everyone there either had tattoos, piercings, or both - as mentioned in the other reviews, this place is a magnet for hipsters for sure.   My friends and I sat out on the patio and got beers and food. I ordered the Turkey Croissant sandwich with cole slaw, and it was excellent. My friend ordered the Chipotle Hummus and it was also very good! The pita was a little burnt, but it was still fine to eat.   Our service was attentive and friendly, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I'm glad I finally made the trip to Casey Moore's and I hope to be back soon!",

Attention road warriors, it's good to have a place in every city you can have an adult meal or snack after 10PM.  A dozen oysters are $13.00 and like 150 high protein calories, a great, light, late meal. Service: understand that this is a bar which serves food and not a restaurant with a big bar. It can be crowded and loud.  There's a bouncer, not a hostess. Find your own table and flag down a server; this is a college town bar, not a white table cloth restaurant.  Once I got to order, I was impressed how promptly my drink and food orders were served, considering the place was packed.  A good value for the money.",

I liked the feel and the look of the place, very woody, felt like it could be a pub in Dublin.    We arrived around 6:30 and our server let us know it was Happy Hour till 7 and that all apps were  1/2 off, so after checking out the app menu I went with the potato skins. They were potato halves stuffed with green chilies topped with melted cheese, chives and bacon with a side of ranch. These were good tasting potato skins!  After checking out the menu I went with Casey's homemade Crab Cakes, sometimes I crave crab cakes, it's crazy I know.  These crab cakes are handmade and severed with fried served with homemade chipotle remoulade. I wasn't that impressed with the crab cakes, to me they were over fried, and the chipotle remoulade just tasted greasy.  Maybe the kitchen was having a bad nice because some of the other dishes that came out where not that great either. Or maybe this is the place to hit for Happy Hour drinks & Apps?  Our serve was great, even though it stated on the menu 1 check per table, he gave us all separate checks. I thought that was nice of him to do.",

They used to play here back in the day and even mention a restaurant on 9th and Ash on a Tuesday night!  Happy hour is one of the best in town since it goes until 7PM; so even those late workers can get a cheap beer and delicious appetizer in (I would suggest the fried clams or the wings).  Service is fast and the beer list is great, but they also have a full bar.  I suggest a black koffee which is a Guinness and a koffee kolsch. It will blow your mind!",

This hipster haven not only offers the perfect cool, aesthetically-pleasing and relaxing environment, but they also serve tasty food and awesome drinks. Service is also standard, though sometimes I do get extra friendly and attentive servers.  My favorites about this place are the green twinkle starry lights in the trees, fried zucchini, clams chowder, and drinks.    In short, I only have great things to say about this place. The one reason I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because there's a lot of smoking going on during my dining/drinking experience. But then again, I guess it won't be a hipster haven after all, if it's not smoking-friendly. So be prepared to do tons of secondhand smoking if you like me - a non-smoker who can seriously care less for cigarettes smoke.   Nonetheless, it definitely worth a try!",

It's pretty loud, chaotic and the service and food is just okay. Upon arrival, I got carded and witnessed the courtyard of CM to be overrun with college students ... seriously it was like those fraternity party scenes out of a movie.   I just wanted to try their oysters, have a small bite to eat and a glass of beer and call it a night. Shared a dozen raw oysters, fried baby neck clams and buffalo wings with Kay and got the Four Peaks Peach Ale. Good oysters, wish they had a mignonette to go with it however but the horseradish and cocktail sauce was sufficient. Oysters tasted fresh, not much flavor to them compared to Olympias, Kusshis or Kumas so expect regular, Pacific type oysters. The baby neck clams reminded me of calamari, not too much sweetness as I was expecting and came with thick breading in small pieces. The buffalo wings were expected as at any other establishment and served with crudites.  Ended up paying about $21 EACH for sharing oysters, 2 apps and a glass of beer which I think is a bit excessive. So yeah, it's overpriced for what they serve.  All in all, would probably come back again for oysters, escargot to-try and alcohol. However, I'll probably go and do that in the day time.",

Zero star for: - escargot had tons of mushrooms inside.... ehhhhh.... the mushrooms and escargot look alike.... I couldn't figure what is what and ended up having tons of mushrooms.... I prefer my escargot go the tranditional way meaning they are soaked in melted butter By THEMSELVES  Zero star for the seafood linguine with alfredo sauce: - I asked for the sauce that would be the lightest and the waitress recommended this one.... interesting.... this ended up super greasy.... so if this is light then the other two sauces would just be blocks of lard or something?!  After the meal, I had a heart burn. I rarely experience such feeling except the couple of times when I had too much BBQ. So to speak about the greasiness of the food here :(",

    "text": "If you have a wait staff, dont have a seat yourself policy. It's not like I sat in the corner, my daughter and I sat by the cozy pond, waited nearly 10 mins before I asked for menus. That was after the waitress attended the table next us, talked to the guy with the dog behind us and a waiter walked by us and told us to have a nice day, as if we were leaving. I realized we were invisible to the staff and I wanted to leave, knowing that other patrons saw that we were being ignored, I started to feel awkward as if they were waiting for us to leave too. I tried to convince my daughter to leave, even if we were to be served, I didn't want to eat or be here a second longer, my experience was already sour. After I realized my daughter was set in oysters I knew she wouldn't eat, a waitress asked how things were, I finally got menus, after that I waited almost as long for the check as I did for the menus. I paid and left without saying anything because the waitress sounded sour as she wished us a good day. Sorry Casey Moore's, I just cant any more. It was too hot to be ignored in your establishment",

They've also got a great list of local beers- I recommend the Huss Koffee Kolsch from Tempe if they have it in stock, looks like a light beer but legitimately tastes like coffee, yum.

It's said to be haunted, but I've yet to see a ghost. I'll keep you posted.  The outdoor patio is huge and features misters and fans to keep it cool during the summer. Basically, the atmosphere at Casey's is fantastic.  The food is also great. They have regular bar food alongside seafood and traditional Irish options. Anyone can find something to eat.  The beer list is fairly short, but they make up for this with perfectly poured Guinness and boozy whiskey sours.",

This place does not disappoint! It was AMAZING! It's an outdoor restaurant (which I usually don't care for) but it was such a great atmosphere, with great music and an all around great vibe! Our server was AWESOME too! I had chicken tenders which came with french fries and dipping sauce. It was so much food I couldn't finish it all (I wish they would have seasoned the chicken though). My sister had fish and chips and it was huge, flaky and flavorful. My mom had a seafood special and it was loaded too! We ordered oysters on a half shell (my first time trying them) and they were so fresh and tasty. We also ordered crab cakes, which they fried very hard and had to remake, but the second batch was great and the waitress didn't charge us for them either. We also had cocktails and they were cheap and good. Overall this place was great and I hope you go check them out.",

And the servers never come back to you. For the 2 hours we were there, we saw the server 3 or 4 times and that includes being seated and also paying the check.   If it's just drinks, it's ok to stand around. That's fine.  But it seems like a happening place so that's a plus. Food wise, it's ok. I see it as pretty much bar food they fry up in the back although they do have sandwiches and raw oysters.  I would probably say come here in the day for food. At night, you come for the drinks and to look cool.",

If lunch is what you're looking for then look no further. Casey's has a terrific menu of sandwiches, appetizers, salads, and full meals. Famous for their oysters, Casey's is definitely not just your average bar. On that note it is also very laid back and very much so \"every mans\" bar. A strange paradox! Check it out!

Well anyway we sat down inside and waited to be greeted by a server and no one showed up after waiting about ten minutes and got up to try and get the bartender attention to no avail. So after waiting about a total of 15 minutes we walked out. Needless to say, their service was non-existence on this visit. Also no one asked how every thing was.",

I found out really late in life that Seafood can be delicious in life without tasting like you scooped some gruel from the middle of the Arctic ocean. I came here with a friend and we asked the bartender what we should have. She immediately recommended there Oysters. She explained how to eat them, the popular ways they are served and eaten. I was glad that she explained this as thoroughly as she did. When they arrived they were different but delicious. Like nothing I had ever tasted before. It was a pleasant feeling to know that I have another dish to explore when I come by a seafood joint. I have nothing to compare it too, but I was nonetheless pleased with  the food.",

There's a gigantic outdoor patio that wraps around half of the restaurant/bar's perimeter, and some indoor seating, too; however, with the heat lamps, the outdoor seats are preferable, even in the winter. There's some parking in their private lot, but it fills up quickly, so you might be better off looking in the shopping plaza that abuts Casey Moore's or on the street.   The food here was always good enough--I usually got the hummus appetizer or fries to split with friends. Drinks and food are both reasonably priced, and service is decent. Gotta love this place!",

The atmosphere at Casey Moore's is relaxed and perfect if you want to have a good conversation with friends over drinks.   The food is tasty and comparably priced to other dive bars in the area - not cheap, but fair quality. Casey Moore's does include an appetizer discount during their happy hour which saves you a couple bucks. Honestly if you're coming just for drinks, an appetizer plate will do a fine job as an add-on since they're really entrees in my eyes.   Speaking of drinks, there are plenty of standards as well as microbrews on tap. The service on refills is speedy too. As a bonus, if you're like me and can't have gluten (or if you're not a beer person), Casey Moore's offers Angry Orchard hard cider on tap.  Casey's is my favorite place. Definitely put it on your list if you'd like to avoid the typical Mill Avenue crowd.",

Food: to me this place is complex on simple food. The oysters Rockefeller are some of the best I've ever had and this is a place in the middle of the desert. Fish and chips came soggy and the taste was not all there. The potatoe skins on would assume are regular bar skins when they arrive but it's not. The potatoes were actually hearty potatoes and not the thin disks you get at EVERY other place. The green Chile enhances the expected flavors of a generic skin and takes it maybe a level above. Let's go back to the oysters... why because I crave them.  Service: laid back but sweet and suggestive when asked. Good job.",

I'm a sucker for anything that's not in a strip mall and the fact that it's in the historic Maple-Ash neighborhood in Tempe is a bonus. It's neat to sit and drink on the large patio and watch people walk to their homes or on their way to Mill Ave. I'm always jealous of those people. If I could afford one of those houses, I'd move there and frequent Casey Moore's every week. Being walking distance from such a cool bar? Score. It's a nice change to have brews on their large patio and enjoy the winter or spring weather.",

    "text": "A great change of pace when you need a break from Mill Ave. Fresh beer, great food, and great service. A lot more tables and space than it seems from the outside. The indoor bar is great but can get cramped when the bar is packed, but the outdoor bar and the surrounding tables are a great alternative.  Of course Fridays and Saturdays are packed, although still a great time, but if you want to get a few beers and relax, go early in the week (great parking during the week too). When it's happy hour, the food is absurdly cheap and fantastic. I find Casey Moore's to be a good place to go before a night on Mill. It's only a few minutes from the corner of University & Mill on Ash in what used to be a house. Great atmosphere and a True bar experience.",

The Bad: The inside bathroom is pretty terrible and way too small (another outside). Parking can be a real problem, mainly on weekends.   Crowds here consist mainly of ASU college types. No jukebox, but sometimes they have random entertainment, like setting up video games outside. Giant patio for smoking. Be prepared for large crowds on weekend nights. Oh, and at least one hungry \"stray\" kitty cat prowling around  =)  This place is definitely worth checking out if you've never been.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. A ton of my friends came here often in college and it's a nice location. Tucked into a cozy corner in the Maple Ash neighborhood by ASU, Casey's is a great concept for a pub, but they fall flat on so many levels. First of all, I hate about 95% of its clientele. A lot of loud and rowdy dude bros with their low-tolerance just-turned-21-but-look-like-they're-16 type girlfriends mixed in with confused 20-something hipsters, and crust punks who scream for anarchy when really they're still drinking on their parent's dime. The draught selections are average-- nothing exciting or anything but are always served in a nice cold pint glass. Prices are great, but food teeters on below average. The food at George and Dragon is definitely better...and I'd stay away from those Oysters if I were you...boyfriend got tremendously sick from there here once and it was bad. If you must eat here, get something grilled and get it well done. Just in case, you know? ALSO, service can be slow because the waitresses space out and forget about you...and while the bouncers are nice, they're dumb. I have had to argue quite a few times about my ID being valid even though it wasn't horizontal (AZ IDs are vertical until you turn 21, which you then go and get a new ID that is horizontal). Basically, they didn't want to be bothered with reading what year I was born in...and at that point, I was already 23...WHATEVER, BRAHS. File under: loud and obnoxious.",

They checked ID at the door because it's also a bar, and we stood there like idiots for a while before being told that we can sit wherever we like.  We opted to sit outside, further away from the drunken middle-aged people at the bar, and the patio was quite nice.  Looks like a great place to have a few drinks and hang out.  They have a pretty good deal on oysters--$12 for a dozen.  I didn't like these oysters as much as the ones I had gotten on the east coast, but they still satisfied our craving plus it's cheap.",

    "text": "I would not ever, ever, ever go here again if it weren't for the fact that my group of friends practically lives here. I really don't know what they see in the place other than \"hey we've been going here every week for the better part of 10 years now...why would we do anything else?\"  Pros: It's uh. It's a bar? With an outdoor bathroom that lets you pee on the wall? I dunno. I digress. There are some good parts.  1. Management and Bartenders: Awesome folks. Very personable. If you have any issue with the place at all, the manager will do his best to make sure you're happy, even if there's not much he can do.   2. Aside from the people who drink here(which I'll touch on below), the actual physical atmosphere is nice. I like patio bars.  Cons:  1. Door staff are assholes. This is the first place I've ever had a security person anywhere ever lay their hands on me. I walked out the side entrance to make a phone call in a quieter area and told the guy I'd be right back in. Finished my very short phone call within eyesight of the guy making eye contact with him a few times during the call. I walked back into the bar past him. He followed me 50 feet into the bar and grabbed me by the back of my neck and started screaming at me about showing ID every time you walk into the place. I literally talked to the guy not 5 minutes before in order to avoid having to go through the ID process all over again. If it ever happens again I'm calling the police and filing a battery charge.   2. Food is garbage. With the exception of the potato skins, everything on the menu sucks. But it's REALLY hard to make lousy potato skins.  3. Beer menu is small/not really listed anywhere. Ask the waitress which beers they have and she'll tell you a few random ones that she can think of off of the top of her head and say \"and we have others I guess\". If you want Kiltlifter or Fat Tire, you're set. If you want anything else, it's a 50/50 shot on whether or not they have it.  4. Hipster. Central. Seriously the clientele here is atrocious. I've literally been verbally assaulted here for eating potato skins by a waifish, meth-mouthed denizen who was the human embodiment of the lyrics of Macklemore's \"Thrift Shop\" because there was cheese and bacon on my food. He went off on me for being offensive to animals or some such. Telling me I would be a vegetarian if I had to kill the animal myself. On a friday night, the place is packed wall-to-wall with the whiniest, heroin-chic douchebags you will ever meet. I feel like this is the case because they don't like the loud music of the bars on mill so they walk around the corner and park themselves at Casey's.  5. Cops. Lots and lots and lots of cops. If you go here on a semi-regular basis(once or twice a month or more) for a long enough period of time, you WILL be stopped immediately after leaving the bar. The Tempe PD are for the most part nice folks, but the ones who patrol looking to catch a DUI coming out of Casey's are all assholes. Not really the bar's fault at all, but it's part of the experience of going there.  6. Pricing. Two drinks and a plate of aforementioned potato skins? 20 dollars plus tip. Look to spend at least 5 dollars(tip included) for a pint of beer here unless it's on special/happy hour. 7 to 10 dollars for a mixed drink with well liquor(tip included).   7. Parking. 10-15 parking spots in their lot. Yeah. 10 to 15 spots. For a bar that is usually packed to the brim with people. After the stores close down, you can park in the little strip mall parking lot around the corner. But again, there's always a cop car or motorcycle cop just sitting in that lot waiting for you to look like you're walking toward a car.   8. Wait staff sucks. It's always sucked. It's not really their attitude all the time(though it is sometimes). They hire like 3 or 4 girls(I'm not being sexist, they only hire females to do wait staff) to cover what's usually close to 1,000 people(maybe more? I'm not a good judge of actual numbers of people) all asking for booze at the same time. Don't even bother placing drink orders with them. Just walk up to the bar and pay with cash and then go back to your seat.    9. Bathrooms are horrendous. It's really hard to use the bathroom when there are 2 urinals and one stall for guys. Especially once 10pm rolls around and the holocaust-skinny hipster kids I mentioned above start vomiting in the stall and sink because they can't hold their booze and drinking in a college town means DRINK UNTIL YOU DIE. The blarney stone is all well and good until a dude takes a dump in there.   10. Climate control. Because of the patio setup, it's always too hot or too cold to be really comfortable, save for the few months per year here in the valley that the weather is really nice. It's still 90+ degrees at 11pm here 6 months out of the year.   If you haven't been here? Don't bother going. You'll get suckered into meeting your friends for drinks for the next 6 years.",

I'm not part of any 'hip' crowd, so the people watching and atmosphere is foreign but enjoyable.   The food has been sliding steadily downhill for years. They use to make that slaw by hand. Not anymore. But, they have a great selection.   The service is subpar, almost notoriously so. Except at the bar. The bartenders and the drinks they serve are a reason to keep coming back.   The patio is lovely all year around. Thomas the cat is a local celebrity. And, you can tell who's working by what music is being played.   3/5 stars: Loyalty and atmosphere keep me coming. Food is always a hit or miss. Service is always a miss. But with good company and a Guinness, who cares?",

Very tasty but a little dry. For the main coarse, the lighter side meal came with grilled salmon, ginger rice and fresh sauteed mixed vegetables all for $13, what a deal!  Everything cooked perfectly. Also ordered the cod Fish & Chips.  The Beer battered Atlantic cod was out of sight, way too much food to eat. The homemade tarter sauce was excellent.  The reason for the 4 stars, we ordered fried clams to go.  They DO NOT reheat well.  They were tough and chewy. The decor is rustic but the Tiffany lamps and stain glass windows gives it a vintage appeal being a haunted house and now an Irish Pub.  The patio wraps around the house so there is plenty of outdoor seating.  Ask for Melisa if you dine indoors, she was terrific! The bathrooms are clean and the silver ware polished. We can't wait to return.",

    "text": "This is a really fun place to come grab dinner or even just drinks.  There are lot of stories around the building that is Casey Moore's, so be sure to ask your server. Great food items include the fish and chips, the fish special, New York steak, and escargot (appetizer) among others. They usually have one beer on tap that is on special, so ask about that.  The unique part about Casey Moore's is that depending on where you sit, you'll have a different experience. Even outside, you can sit near the bar area and have one experience with the pretty koi fish, but if you make your way around the building towards the front (street), it's a whole new atmosphere. Heat lamps outside all over the place, although they aren't very effective when it's really cold (yes snowbirds, it does get cold in AZ). The inside is pretty neat, too. There is a bar area that is usually very crowded (doesn't help that it is by the bathroom) but is very traditional, and they also have a small dining room area that is quieter than the rest of the restaurant.  Dudes: there is a door outside that is a male-only restroom. Okay, it's not really a restroom--it's more like a wall that you straight up pee on. I guess they call it a \"Blarney Stone\", may want to Google it but it is way better than waiting for the bathroom (even has a sink).   All in all, this is a great spot off of Mill Avenue that you'll find yourself coming back to.",

    "text": "The most unique bar in Tempe, in my opinion. This place is an absolute staple for me personally. If you're looking for something different from the Mill Ave crowds, this neighborhood bar is worth a look. As you can see from the neighboring houses, Casey Moores is actually a historic home modeled to run as a pub. While the indoor area is comfortable and homey, the patio is exceptional (especially for brunch) during nicer times of the year.   This place has a rich history, almost too much to fit in one review. They have their own wandering cats, a koi fish pond, blarney stone that doubles as a restroom and apparently this place is haunted too. The outdoor bar is perfect and the service is always phenomenal, all the bartenders are some of the best I've encountered in the area. The servers are always friendly and used to large amounts of traffic. I've seldom if ever had a bad experience.  I didn't expect the food to be that good, thinking beer was more their thing, but in recent years it's actually become quite good. Bar food is always top notch, chicken fingers and wings, burgers, etc. I'm partial to their salad with blackened chicken added. Oh, and you can customize your own grilled cheese. One of the best I've had, hands down.  This place is no longer a secret. Friday and Saturday nights people turn out in droves. If the 'cool' crowd isn't your thing, no worries. Get here early evening pretty much any night of the week and the place is ideal. Love this place!",

The restaurant was large enough to accomodate everyone and the staff was very helpful in assembling tables and chairs. Ther service was prompt and the food surprisingly quick given our size.   I thought of trying the oyster po-boy that was a lunch special, but in the end I went with one of my favorites - fish and chips. I have had countless fish and chips and restaurants and bars throughout the US and UK. This was right up there near the top of the list. The breading wasn't heavy; the fish light and flakey. I found the cole slaw with the green and red cabbage and carrots was exceptionally good. It was not saucy or too rich. The flavor of the vegetables stood out with just enough sauce to provide flavor. Yum! The portion was so big that I barely touched the fries. You will most likely come away with a doggie bag from this place.  I would definitely go back - maybe try some oysters or try out the bar.",

Nestled in the cultural hub of SUNI WOFAR at Ninth and Ash, the constant hum of the poorly aged, the tattooed and perma-service-industried are a testament to the ubiquitous appeal of their oysters. Never has an Irish sea-food joint catering to the left-leaning post-college-dropout been so successful at attracting the faux attractive. Though I admittedly am unfamiliar with what exactly it is that makes \"Casey's\" oysters stand at the apex of barnacle-cousin potential as the \"Field of Dreams Principle\"* proves itself True with the emergence of their salt-water invertebrates, I can't shake the feeling that their must be something in water; yes, in the very water that flows in pipes in the wall between \"Blarney Stone\" and kitchen. The Blarney Stone, for those unaware, is the unique semi-functional hardly sanitary piss-mist filled stall that has a permanently flowing fountain of water and patron-pee on a fake rock wall. It serves as the most practical option as it is about 10 feet wide with a back up moat that creeps about the floor so even the most shy guy doesn't have to worry about rogue droplets outing his poor post-fifth-beer-dribble-and-shake skills.  That concoction filtered through SNUS packs and popped zits and dip spit makes its way to the maybe-working drain and from there it goes somewhere, the sewer maybe. BUT NO! It couldn't just go to the sewer, not in place where its urinal is as \"unique\" as the patrons themselves - that don't at all look like a homogenous crowd of HTC and Cartel social graduates - we can't expect its drainage system to be as middle of the road as your run of the mill bar, no we must expect something grand and unimitatable.   So about the theory proposed prior: since oysters in their regular form are certainly not addictive enough to bring all those who fancy their flavor to run back week after week at any other establishment, Casey's must be doing something during the preparation of the shellfish. Remember the five expelled beers per patron and SNUS packs mentioned? Well obviously with alcohol and tobacco, two of the most addictive domestic substances, flowing seemingly infinitely through the veins of the structure, I'm quite sure those post body residual chemicals make their way through some fork in the road piping that runs in from the Blarney Stone and back out through the faucets in the kitchen and is then used to boil the oysters! That's what brings them back every Friday and Saturday night! Those literally addictive oysters! Because obviously nobody in their right non-addicted mind would ever fight tooth and nail, or stand uncomfortably up to thirty minutes, for a table where your knees bonk all the wrong people. But if you're looking to find a skateboarder, you've found the right bar.   Vegans: They put Parmesan cheese on their fries so if that's your go to bar snack make sure and order them plain. Also I've gotten conflicting reports from servers about the veggie burgers being vegan or not. They might have egg in the buns.   *Remember: \"If you build it, they will come\"? I'm sure something along the unfunny lines of \"If you boil them, they will come\" applies here.",

I haven't been here since my buddy Hannah Y. left us for her new life in Seattle, but I have fond memories of our drunken nights here after a tough day at work. Yes - we had some awesome sober days here as well but I think we didn't get as drunk thanks to their delicious assortment of sandwiches and oysters.    I did get sick here once having a screwdriver possibly from an unwashed glass, but this is probably one of the most laid back bars you can find in the Tempe area so minute things like this doesn't bother me. Hopefully, we can get the gang together and enjoy our time there once again when my dear friend comes down to visit for Thanksgiving   :)",

There is plenty of seating to handle massive crowds.  If you are a smoker, this place is paradise.  They have giant swamp coolers set up to cool the outside air on the scorchers.  The outside bar is my favorite spot, but often taken up.    The food is pubalicious.  The menu is extensive with pubby seafood items to simple sandwiches.  I go here for the Oysters.  Nothing better than Guiness and Oysters and this place does it right.  The Oysters Rockefeller is a special treat the make and they take 35 mins!  Worth it!  I had the Fish and Chips the other day and that was a friggin tasty surprise.    Then you have the people.  If you like a variety of color on your palette, definitely come here.   No one looks the same, in my opinion.  It is definitely a more \"young\" college type crowd.  Hipsters, road bikers...  people have fun.  I don't find it pretentious at all but I also feel like I fit right in.  NEVER let a crowd scar you.  So, Cheers Casey's, your still holding up what I've always loved best about you!",

I'm not a bar person - especially not these days, but Casey's holds a special place in my heart.  I think that it has to do with the outdoor patio.  I love the space.  I like the trees and shrubbery.  It feels quite homey.  I've ordered many salads, sandwiches and burgers - and have always found the food surprisingly good.  From appearance, it doesn't look like that kind of place can put out such good food - but they do!  I suggest a late afternoon stop by for early dinner and beer.    Great place!!!",

If I went to college at ASU I know I would have been a regular at this place.  I love how many places there are to sit outside and I love the lighting.  I can imagine day drinking would be glorious here although I have yet to experience it.  I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and it was great but for some reason the spinach was not cold...maybe that 96 and balmy had something to do with it.  My boyfriend had the burger and my best friend enjoyed her seafood sandwich.  The star of the table was the chocolate cake which I sadly bailed on.  The ambiance makes the place and when in the area, I am sure to return for a casual evening with friends in the future",

I went today to have lunch with a friend and really enjoyed my Shrimp and Avocado salad.  The service was slow even though there was only one other occupied table in the restaurant area.  The food definitely made up for the slower service.  They have a lot of seafood on the menu as they are an Oyster house. I don't know that I would ever try oysters in the middle of the desert but I hear their Clam Chowder is awesome.   A lot of friends eat here on a regular basis and enjoy it but I mostly go to Caseys for liquid refreshment only.   The only complaint I have is that this place gets PACKED some weekends and the wait for the bathroom can be ridiculous.  I really don't like overcrowded places and Caseys definitely has that potential on any given Friday or Saturday night.",

I love the patio, very cool surroundings-aside from the occasional meat-head hitting on me or the girls wearing short shorts just to show off their new super cool thigh tattoos. I've never had a problem finding a table...maybe I get there too early (good sign or bad sign?) and have always had fantastic experiences with the servers. The servers always seem very down-to-earth and amused at our antics so that's a plus. When one drunk guy made a shitfit and threw a plate at my friend's skull, the server was awesome enough to join in on yelling at him.  Note: Do not throw fire in each others mouths, the owner does not like that. Who would have known?",

This was Yelped about highly so I gave it a shot.  Average college hang out, little effort on amenities and full attention to stocked taps and bar specials.    I was expecting a generous variety of Oyster dishes to choose from.  Not many on the menu but the basics so I went with some grilled salmon.  It was topped with crab and I got the sauce on the side.  Crab wasn't so good and I pushed it to the side.  The salmon on the other hand was just the way I like it.   Bottom Line -  I did go during happy hour (not purposely) and no one was really eating (except my face) but everyone was drinking and having a good time.  Go there for the booze is my best advice and keep the food in mind as an after thought.  It wasn't bad by all means but it wasn't something I would go out of my way to eat again.  Avg dinner price was $20 per person with no drinks.",

(I think, I mean I did graduate from ASU)  I wasn't going to review this place until I finally made it here for lunch one day. It's pretty far from my downtown Phoenix office for a lunch stop, but I stopped here on the way to Living Canvas tattoos around the corner. I had NEVER seen this place in the light of day, and I was impressed. It was far different than the hipster/ASU kid hang out that it becomes after 9pm. It was an awesomely sunny day so we ate out in the patio. Although it's weird sitting on the same patio furniture that I've sat many a nights with many a cocktails, it's such a different vibe during the day.   The wait staff seemed really overwhelmed, and we had slower than normal service (so my girlfriend said). But the salad was 5-star worthy, which was totally unexpected from this place. I didn't check up on the #glutenfree-ness of the place (I'm assuming the fryers are used for fries, breaded chicken, etc. like most bar-food-esque places), so I ordered the shrimp salad, and the shrimp was unreal awesome. I'm sort of a shrimp fanatic, so I'm always impressed when seafood tastes like this isn't a landlocked state. The salad was huge and totally filling, and not expensive for a lunch stop. I wish I worked closer to Tempe so I could become a regular lunch enthusiast here.   And for the bar? Well you can read any other 5-star review on here...it's amazing. It's such a brilliant mix of people, with no drama BS you see at other places to drink near Mill. The drinks are reasonably priced and the wait staff is totally awesome. This is one of the few bars I actually enjoy going to, and don't mind feeling like I fit in. The bartenders also don't look at you like an idiot if you order an iced tea at 1 in the morning - sometimes you can get the wonky eye from bar staff at other places. I went at Casey Moore's for my birthday, so I feel like that pretty much gives my final stamp of approval.",
