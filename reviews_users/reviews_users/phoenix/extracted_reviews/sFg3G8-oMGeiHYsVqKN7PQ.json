Besides the great memories made, the coffee is great. I ordered the oatmeal with wheat toast and it is consistently good.   Jerry's has a small town feel with great service and good food. What more could you want?",

    "text": "Think old style diner, and you get this place.  The atmosphere and decor is kitschy, funky, and interesting, and the food is generally tasty, but in an old style way.  For example, if you order a shake, you get milk and ice cream that isn't all that thoroughly mixed, just like you used to make at home.  It was awesome and nostalgic.  Ultimately, it is as serviceable as any Denny's substitute with better prices and some really outstanding service.  The other reviews on that score surprised me, but we were there later at night, so maybe during the day the staff gets overwhelmed.  All I can say is that the guy who waited on us (whose name I can't remember, but he was a young bald guy) was an outstanding example of customer service.  I wish I could clone him and put him in every restaurant in America.  Go here.  It's not haute cuisine, but you'll enjoy yourself.",

Not everything is good though, and I've spoken with my friends about what they eat and they seem to agree with me.  I've had good experience with their eggs/breakfast meals.  The scrambles are very good and are worth the price.  I had a sandwich that was ok, not great.  I had a homemade dessert once and was pretty disappointed.  I'll just stick with the breakfast items.  Jerry's is an above-average quality 24hr diner, but some things on the menu are better than others.  Everything is very homemade.",

    "text": "Granted it's a possibility that this restaurant is a mom and pop type of place but they seriously lack in speed of service. Stopped in here for a bite to eat while killing time before an appointment. Walked in and was not even acknowledged. We sat ourselves down and it took about 15 to 20 mins before the server came to ask what we would like to drink. There was a table with four guests that walked in way after we did and had their order taken before we did. It took almost another 20 mins to get our order and once it arrived there was a few things wrong. I ordered the sampler platter which came with onion rings, mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, and potato bites; my father inlaw ordered the 2 egg breakfast plate which came with hash browns and toast. My onion rings were over cooked, the chicken tenders were over cooked to a point and the mozzarella sticks were slightly over cooked as well. I also ordered a Dr Pepper to drink. My father inlaw ordered a peach tea that tasted more like regular tea with a lemon wedge. His hash browns were under cooked but the eggs came out cooked to my specification. They weren't even busy and they had only two server's that were taking orders. Some lady in a pink shirt was probably a manager but not for sure. I will not recommend this restaurant unless you are willing to wait about an hour for your food. Also my father inlaw had to use the restroom before we left and he told me that the stall was smaller then he can get into with his walker. He is handicapped and had a hard time getting in the stall. My complaint isn't merely about the server's is more towards the restaurant it self. We had to come up from Prescott Valley and where we had to be this place was close by. So I hope someone will do something about there speed of service and customer service could use and upgrade. Thanx",

They are such joys of sunshine, I feel like they'd prefer that we didn't come here, like we are burdening them. I'll gladly go somewhere else if y'all are going to have such crap attitudes. Id like to add that our waitress was not pleasant. When it came time to pay the bill, I gave her cash. I put my hand out and she quickly put the money on the counter and walked away. That is a big No No for me. I've worked 16years in the customer service industry. You do not do that. We just left the restaurant. Literally, 10/2/15 10:57am. The manager wasn't in, I will be speaking to her today. I do not want anyone to lose their job, but a definite attitude adjustment is in order.",

We were staying at the Embassy Suites next door so we walked over to Jerry's to try out something they don't have back home. I personally don't care for breakfast food, but my brother loves it. Those pancakes...delicious delicious delicious. The prices are sooo consumer friendly too, we left like a fifty percent tip and still had enough money to come back the next day and do it again without a care. I have been all over the country and this is the only Jerry's I've ever seen, so if you're in the area I recommend hitting it up, even if you're like me and don't typically like breakfast food. Definitely a local delight.",

But the other review was not kidding about incompetent cooks. I went in this place at about 2am and the cook was in the parking lot smoking a cigarette. After I placed my order, she came back in and I had a bad feeling. I waited for my food which was supposed to be eggs benedict, and when it came out, the eggs were not poached, they were fried. And they were raw. Not a little underdone, I mean the entire center portion of the white around the yolk was still clear. Cook must have been on drugs. I feel bad for the late night waitress. She offered to have it remade but I said I lost my appetite and asked for the check. I had a cranberry juice. And she said it was on the house, so I walked out.   It took like a year, but I've actually gone back here since that incident and nothing as bad has happened. But bottom line, you're probably better off going to IHOP or Denny's.",

There are a ton of breakfast choices to be had, as well as the lunch/dinner type items.    For me it's all about the chicken fried steak.  The steak is perfectly cooked and the gravy is delicious.

So we order drinks, and when she gets back we know what we want and order food. 20-30 min later food is here but it's not our order. She comes back with our food but my order is wrong. Grr.. So she asks me what my order was and she brought me my order.   The food was good, I have no complaints about that. I ordered the Bacon and Egg with a side of toast. (She brought hash browns that was free) Hubby ordered country fried steak and eggs- filling and good per hubby.  So with all that said, will I go back- maybe.

As much as I wanted to try their food, I would never come back here ever again :$  This is like a rejection of patronage hehehe  We saw you and we don't want you here lol  Well,,, heard!

Otherwise you will spend quite awhile waiting for service , drinks, meals or refills.  The food seems to be kinda inconsistent.. Today my ham steak was delish, but my hashbrowns were cold and undercooked.  My waitress was very sweet.. kept my glass filled without having to ask her.  Avoid at all costs if they are packed or there is a large group in the back seating area.. you will fall asleep before getting your food..  Over all decent.. good value.. will return..",

Not because they are busy: plenty of staff walk right by me and keep going. Getting an order right has happened only once out of 5 visits. Something is  either missing or I'm brought the wrong item altogether. The real shame is the staff are nice but it seems like training just does not happen. It's bad enough that I'll never return.",

Has the food quality slipped during the last couple of decades, yup! But thats not the point ... its funky, colorful, with just the right amount of wear around the edges to flip the middle finger at the future.   Where else can you get a ham steak the size of your plate so gloriously salty you can't even eat it. Fried chicken, while now small, at least still tastes like \"real\" fried chicken. Or try my favorite, sliced turkey and gravy over a bed of potatoes o'brien ... oh baby!   Stop in and get your fix of 20th Century diner food before it fades into darkness.",

I cannot tell you how many times we've driven by this restaurant, but a couple weekends ago, we stopped in for a quiet dinner.   Our love for things vintage and ''old-school'' is well represented in this eatery. Great vintage posters on the bathroom walls, classically appointed with well-maintained seating/dining areas, and personable staff that makes you feel right at home and happy you stopped in.  I had the special lasagne with salad and French bread and my boyfriend had a delicious mushroom burger, cooked to order. Neither one of us left hungry or feeling cheated. The food was excellent; service was great, and the prices were very good. We spent about an hour total, but with the ambience of the place, we put down our phones and had an honest to goodness conversation like back in the olden days before technology took over.  It's a great place to reconnect with humanity and each other. The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is peaceful, and the server we had was an exceptional woman with a great attitude.  Definitely worth a high rating and we will be eating there many more times. Feed yourself well, both physically and mentally. Jerry's is hometown kind of food!!!",

It was very late at night so I was glad to see Jerry's open; we decided to give it a try.   Ambience: The people who were already seating and eating seemed like they knew the kitchen and waitress very well. It was quiet, but I assume it was because it was at midnight.   Food: My spinach and eggs dish was very bland. I didn't care to finish the dish or take it home at all. The water (I had hot water and my boyfriend had iced) was very good though for some reason. It tasted a bit sweet? I was addicted to it.   Other: Our waitress wasn't rude but she sort of had a meh attitude. I definitely don't mind it but it was an effort to try to ask for condiments and water refills.",

Open 24 hours a day and seven days a week makes it a top pick.   The menu offers a large selection of breakfast options served anytime.  From Old fashioned home made biscuits and Sausage gravy to pot toast and vegetables.  The menu has something for everyone.  I am all about finding a place that still offers homemade pies. Jerry's is that place.  A variety of homemade pies and fresh baked rolls and cakes. Another plus is a good old fashion hand made shake. I would like to see them offer malts as well.   The service was very good as well. I happen to be in town for business and staying next door at the Embassy Suites. I would call over in the evening and place my order to go. They were great about making sure that I had everything needed to cook/reheat the entree in my room.",

Only downside was bathrooms weren't too clean and smelled like puke.    It's right around the corner so I'll probably be back!",

    "text": "I've been in the process of moving, and have been Cox-blocked several times. (Was cut off at my old house too soon, having issues getting service at the new place.) I don't have a smart phone - so I really need internet access to coordinate the move and stay in touch with the outside world.  Denny's and Starbucks lost my interest very quickly. I needed wifi access, and I am more than happy to be a paying customer to get it. Oh, and I keep a late night schedule.  Enter Jerry's. Not far from the new house, open 24/7, and wifi access as requested.  Until this past week, I hadn't been into Jerry's in almost 20 years. I am so sorry it fell off my radar - this is a great place for a quick and affordable meal anytime day or night. And - quite the happy surprise - the food is pretty damn tasty!  Late night, visit #1 - I wasn't really hungry, but thought it would be tacky to just nurse an iced tea, so I was going to get a slice of dessert. (Offerings were apple, cherry, Boston Creme and Lemon Meringue pie, Chocolate or Lemon cake.) Then the waitress mentioned something about the awesome cinnamon roll with whipped butter, and that sounded perfect. AND IT WAS!  Late morning - visit #2 - Coffee and a Reuben sandwich with fries. Quite possibly the best diner Reuben a girl could ask for! YUM.  Lunch time - visit #3 - I brought a friend today. (Cox was supposed to connect me this morning, she was going to set up my home network. That didn't happen, so the least I could do was buy her lunch.) She had iced tea and a grilled club, I had iced coffee and a hamburger. I was super happy. Her only complaint was all the bacon seemed to be on one side of the sandwich - so she had to open it up to rebalance.  I am happy to have Jerry's nearby - and will most likely be in fairly often  - even when I can access the internet at home. Breakfast 24 hours a day? Yummy desserts? Friendly servers? Reasonable prices? Check, check, check and CHECK!",

    "text": "I am happy to say that I enjoy this restaurant.  The wait staff is smart and funny, the food arrives promptly, and is definitely better than you'd expect. I'll admit, the sign that says \"Jerry's Restaurant\" out front makes it look like it sucks inside, but it doesn't. Think of a classier version of Waffle House, with more menu choices and great coffee.   Today we had chicken fried steak with gravy, an egg scramble-thingy, biscuits, hash browns, corned beef hash (my fave), and sourdough toast. All the items came out super hot and fast, and were very flavorful. The steak was lightly breaded, semi-salty, loaded with gravy. The hash, although a little underdone for my tastes, reminded me of food I ate while growing up in the midwest. The eggs were good, and the sourdough toast sopped up those tasty yolks nicely. Yessir, Jerry's has mastered the perfect American breakfast.   While paying on the way out, the owner-lady mentioned something to the waitress who was ringing us up. She whispered, \"the special tonight is really good, I'm so excited...\" then slipped her a little sample of the night's special in a ramekin and I think may have actually winked at us.  Glad to know that she takes pride in her place and her food, and appreciates her staff.  Pros: chicken fried steak, gravy, biscuits w/orange marmalade, coffee, functional salt & pepper shakers, you can probably get away with wearing your pajamas if you are hungover, obscure Star Trek doll in toy grab game in lobby  Cons: decor, location, nothing out of the ordinary on the menu, ding you on extras  Give it a shot - its a local business and its good eatin. Oh fyi - you pay up front.",

When all you want is a great cup of coffee and a decent breakfast in a zero concept atmosphere, then Jerry's is a solid choice.",

The place is immaculate with lots of great decor.   The food is excellent and surprisingly inventively prepared. I had the Philadelphia cheesesteak and was markedly impressed by the fact that it was not drowning in cheese; I didn't think it'd be that good because it didn't look like the usual Philly cheesesteak. When I bit into it, it was a celebration of peppers meat seasoning and the right amount of cheese. It doesn't look like a Philly cheese steak but it was the best one I've ever had. If you are in downtown Phoenix, you are cheating yourself if you don't come here.  Do yourself a favor, come here for a casual meal and bathe in this awesome retro atmosphere and enjoy the excellent service and food.",

He knew the menu so well, but he encouraged us to be creative and even suggested some of his favorite items and changes to his favorite items! Then, we got to meet Michael..who is probably the head chef because he was talking about doing all kinds of cool stuff with the food. These guys were a wealth of knowledge and we really enjoyed chatting with them about not just food, but also the philosophies of Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope! It was great. Now onto the food!! I was so excited when Patrick told me I wasn't shackled by the strictures of the description of the \"Rock and Roll Waffle\" and he allowed me to have my fried egg on the side, instead of on top of my waffle (as the menu stated) The menu ALSO made it seem as though I couldn't even HAVE a Waffle. I understand that they typically don't keep the irons all all night, which makes sense but I was SO excited when Patrick vetoed that bullshit! Rejoice!! My companion ordered the Strawberry Road cakes and here is his review: \"The burst of flavor was positively sinful. I felt as if the pancakes, aided by the bouquet of whipped cream and strawberries, kissed my palette in ways that made me uncomfortable..in the best way.\" So yeah..you should probably go here.",

    "text": "It was our last night in Phoenix and we were checking in next door at the Embassy Suites and had to leave for the Airport at 6 in the morning.   But what caught my eye was this 24 Hour Diner called Jerry's Restaurant next door  which reminded me of this old Mom and Pop's Diners that you just don't see anymore. It was like something out of a scene from Pulp Fiction where Samuel and John were eating at this type of diner and I was hoping that this diner was one of those 24 hour ones.   And perusing through the Yelp App, I found out that they were open 24 hours so there is no way in hell that I am not gonna eat here before I go back to Honolulu so this is the place we are going to eat at the crack of dawn right before we head out to Sky Harbor Airport.   So here we are at Jerry's Restaurant with menu in hand. This Restaurant has been open since 1966 and the menu has just about everything you could imagine when you come up a place like this.   I ordered Waffles,Eggs, and a side of Ham Steak which was the size of Shaquille O Neal's head!!! They don't mess around with portions here. They give out Samoan style portions here at Jerry's and that's just fine by me.   Despite what other reviewers said about the service here, our server was great and had a great and upbeat personality despite it being so early in the morning.    The restaurant wasn't crowded that early but you can tell that there are a lot of regulars that cone here frequently and I can see why. The prices here are very reasonable and not eye gouging.   Our breakfast sure hit the spot and what way to end our Arizona Vacation and head back home to Honolulu on a happy note. I love the nostalgia and atmosphere of these diner's that are a dying breed.   A great place indeed.....",

I've tried the sausage and eggs (which is a giant polish sausage that has been grilled) and \"The Bus\" (which is a huge piece of ham).  The food is always great and the bill is always under $20 for both of us.  This is our fallback for breakfast now.  No more Denny's or IHOP - ALWAYS JERRY'S.  We even went Christmas morning while waiting for the family to wake up.  This place is top notch.",

So you think the usual suspects, IHOP, eh, 5&Diner, possibly, Denny's, ummm no, Village Inn, yuck. And then you think of that breakfast place you went to for hangover brunch, and you're like, no i want cheap food... so you keep on thinking until you lose interest and that hankering goes away which is kinda good if you're on a diet but heck it's breakfast food so it's good for you even when you have brinner! Well... my phoenicians there's a place that can satisfy those cravings, good diner food, friendly service, and cheap ass places and this mythical place is known as Jerry's Restaurant (since 1966) and it's 24 hours! See ya gay 5 & diner at 16th st, and Jenny's (drag queen denny's) on 7th ave, and hello butch Jerry's!   Recommended items - the Fried Chicken! the Big Bertha's Country Fried Steak and Eggs, the hungry traveler ( unlimited pancakes, 3 eggs, 6 bacon or links all for $7.99), and the of all things yum and gooey... their cinnamon roll with whipped butter... uh yea it's on my list of food items that i want on my table before the world ends in 2012.   Yea it's a geriatric central but you gotta love old people and old ladies that are servers who all have some attitude and sweetness altho the gay server has total cattyness... rowr... this gay boy wasn't gonna have it tho... if you're a bitch to me i'm a bitch to you... easy as that!

They told me that a man was present signing books and speaking to a group of people.  His name is David Irving and he was invited to speak by the group about his beliefs that the Holocaust didn't happen.  And that Hitler never knew about the Jews being slaughtered.  This is sick and made me lose my appetite.  Why would a restaurant like Jerry's support a local Neo-Nazi group?  Apparently, they hold the monthly meetings of the group there as well.  I do not plan to return to this location for any meal in case I run across this type of hatred again. 4.9.12 Since that time, I have been following the story of David Irving.  He has not returned to this restaurant again but went to a hotel near the airport maybe a year later.  It was guarded by the Phx police red squad.  At least the protesters wacked this mole back into his hole for now.",

We ordered a milk shake because they are suppose to be known for great milkshakes but was we was served was a watery mess. We explained we didn't want it and she told us we still would pay for them. After contesting, she grabbed the milkshakes, said something in spanish and walked off. Seconds later, she slams the cups in the sink and began yelling. Luckily, we already had our food!!! From that moment on she had the worst attitude and tossed the bill in the table and walked away!!!! The food was good but the service is the WORST!!!! Yikes!!!!!",

Read the Yelp reviews - which consisted of a mix of good and bad - most likely from regulars and passer-thruers like us. Read about the horrible customer service and alright food. I understand a group of 23 can be difficult to accommodate, especially when you have other tables and low staffing - because yes, it is midnight. BUT, it is no excuse for a server to have no personality or conscience to check in on us and do all the extra things a waitress normally does. Everyone has bad days, but our waitress was dull, uninviting, and overall SUCKY. After we were served with water, it took her 10 minutes to come back to take our orders even though the place was empty and we told her we were ready. Then it took 1 hour and 15 minutes until the first plate of food was delivered! After the first 50 minutes of waiting, we had to walk up to the counter for an update and she said \"we only have one cook... it'll be another 30 minutes at minimum\". Please explain why 2 phone orders that were called in after our orders were done before ours? DO NOT COME HERE.  Update: Our waitress was Haileigh... It wasn't entirely her fault, but she didn't have the basic decency to update us. She kept telling us it was almost done when the food wasn't even on the grill. Our 1 hour and 45 minute wait was our limit and we walked out of there- half of us fed, half of us starving.",

Hey it isn't five star dining but as someone else put it, they serve good comfort food at a decent price.  BUT.... uh oh....WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING OPEN 24 HOURS?  A couple of weeks ago they stopped being open all night.  I kept thinking it was because maybe they didn't have a cook to work nights or something but they still are closing over night.  I'm sad they aren't open 24 hours anymore but hey...I get it.  The business just isn't there to warrant being open.  I'm just glad they are still around and didn't close down altogether !  Remove review    Comment from Kurt R. of Jerry's Restaurant  Business Owner  9/14/2018  Lynda,  Thank you for your kind words.  It is always nice to hear from a satisfied guest.  We were... Read more   So I just wanted to add....Wow Kurt, I feel special hearing from the Owner....now if I could just order that carrot cake (I'm talking the whole cake, not by piece) to go so I could bring it with me to Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving.....I would be one happy customer !  But shhhh don't tell anyone how good it is or there won't be any there when I want some.",

    "text": "I was so excited to see a Jerry's still exist. These places were all the rage back in the Southeastern part of the US in the 80's and early 90's.  Unfortunately, this was quite possibly one of the worse restaurants I have ever eaten at. The food was simply awful and the menu was incorrect (or staff didn't care to follow it). I was there at 6pm on a weeknight and it was dead.  I ordered the Fish and Chips meal with fries and what the menu and waitress described as \"fresh green beans\" and corn bread. When the food arrived it was served with \"texas toast\" that was the smallest piece of bread I've ever seen to go along with cold, stale fries. The green beans were out of a can and devoid of any flavor at all. Finally the fish...oh the fish. It was minced Mrs. Paul's. No really, not kidding. Same size, flavor, color, and everything else.  My wife ordered the bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast. The menu said 3 pieces of bacon, but she got 2. The menu said 2 eggs...this was probably 1/2 of a single egg and it was runny. Finally the toast wasn't toasted at all.  Maybe if this was really cheap food, this score would be a little higher but sadly, it wasn't cheap either. $28 for stale fries, Del Monte green beans, 2 pieces of Mrs Paul's fish, 2 strips of paper-thin bacon, half a barely cooked egg, and 2 slices of Wonderbread.",

The navy bean soup that was part of my entree was delicious, and so large a bowl we shared it. I had the pot roast, which was yummy and quite tender, but not at all fatty. It came with mediocre boxed mashed potatoes, decent corn, and really good Texas Toast. Hubby had a corned beef sandwich with grilled onions and green peppers which he liked well enough, and it came with macaroni salad that he loved. It was simple, but had lots of super crispy and fresh pieces of onion and celery.  I have also had breakfast at Jerry's twice and both times it was delicious, with eggs cooked just as I ordered them. One caveat- the iced tea is super strong and had us up 'til the wee hours.  Give Jerry's a try if you find yourself on Thomas across the street from the Stuffington Bear Factory.

The cinnamon bun, which is delish with the melted butter, is pretty big; it looks like it's be as big as one of my jazz hands.

At least the lady who was working most of the restaurant seemed to have some personality to her. Once I finally got my order taken, the food did arrive quickly and was piping hot.. So it wasn't the kitchen that was slowing things down, it was the server. Corned beef hash was generic and obviously straight out of the can.. The poached eggs were cooked with soft yolks, so I give the cooks credit for knowing how to poach an egg. The potatoes and toast were pretty standard issue stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing wrong with them. For the food, I would give them a solid 3.. But the service (or lack there of) brought the experience down to a 2.

After a long wait, 2 out of 3 orders were wrong and no one liked what did show up on their plate.  I got the Pollack \"all you can eat\" fish fry.  Wow, was it disappointing after the long wait.  The plate showed up with basically one semi-large fish stick.  I stared at it for a few minutes in shock at the lack of food and honestly, gross presentation.  I'm not some snooty guy and I was expecting something in the Denny's/Shari's realm but wow was it worse.  Rather than dive in, I pulled a Gordon Ramsey and pulled apart the fish stick to see what was inside.  As big as it was, there was almost no fish.  Ate a bite of fish and couldn't continue.  I was so frustrated by the experience and the sub-par food that I couldn't bring myself to eat it.  In my entire life, I have never sent anything back to the kitchen, until today.  The waitress came around eventually and I let her know that I was sending it back.  She offered to bring out another dish but I was too irritated and couldn't wait another 45 minutes anyway.  I don't believe I've ever been more disappointed in a meal and I walked in with low expectations.  I've read on other reviews that the breakfast is good.  The other two people in my party ordered the breakfast and also had negative reviews but they were too hungry to send it back.  An all-around bomb of a place.  Maybe it was just an off day but I'll never find out.",

    "text": "YES 5 stars. Ive lived in the neighborhood and never have been to Jerrys because I figured it was a cheap knock off of Dennys. I was very wrong. Instead this place is a throw back to old school neighborhood dinners with most of the clientel as regulars. I have to say I have not seen this high level of 'professional 'servers in a very long time. They were courteous, organized and efficient with a genuine smile. Lets talk food, when it arrived I could not believe the presentation of the meal. Again not just slop on a plate but very appetizing to the senses. I have not had macaroni salad that perfect since...well maybe never. Not tart and not too creamy, just perfect. The omlete was perfectly  prepared and consistently cooked .  When I checked out, the hostess was quick to cash me out, not some 16yr old but a professional hostess. This dinner is straight out of a Tarantino film, except it is not strangely in the middle of nowhere (ever notice that?). This was high end Las Vegas service. You now have another regular.",

Tired of cooking I just wanted out of the house for a bit and this place was perfect.   The dishes are typical diner food and that's exactly what you want when you go to a diner. I have been here twice. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. The eggs, bacon and pancakes were delicious and so was the traditional grilled cheese and fries.   The waitstaff is friendly and the service is speedy. This is a throwback to what a diner should be like. We'll be back. Often.   Update: So sorry to hear they are closing.",

Just in case you were curious, they have nothing in common.  While there may be no Moops, or Bubble Boy... they sure have perfected the Hungry Traveler which includes AYCE Pancakes (get the blueberry ones), 3 eggs, hash browns and 6 (count them, 6!) strips of bacon or sausage links or 4 sausage patties.  And all that food is only going to put you out $10.69 UNLESS you get the Groupon deal that'll give you 25% cash back!",

    "text": "Dining is often a matter of personal preference. Everyone's taste buds, preference of decor, and overall ambiance runs the gamut.  My preference is large tables, late a night. Provide me a decent breakfast food and decent service. And leave me alone for hours on end, especially at night, so that I can code and write - depending on my preference.  Seeing as that this place is off the beaten path, in a not so inviting part of town; it's often devoid of a plethora of patrons until about the 2-3AM hour. Or perhaps, during the lunch rush.  The tables here are immense! Nothing like the ones in the all night chains such as Denny's, IHOP, et al. You can really spread out and work (or write). And as long as you are a paying customer, they pretty much leave you alone.  The food is decent. I've primarily only ordered breakfast type foods here, regardless of the time of day. Definitely, not on par with the breakfast specialty places such as Snooze, Scramble, etc. But, decent enough in terms of affordability and portions.  The service here is prompt, caring, and friendly. It is not uncommon for me to engage whomever is working at that time in a long conversation about life, the universe and everything! (Tip of the hat to Douglas Adams fans out there)  I love the immense windows facing Thomas road. It affords me a great view of the passing traffic. It also allows me to keep an eye on my car, when I just happen to bring the red convertible with me late at night - after a date with my beloved.  I can sit here for hours (and I do), and just be quiet in both thoughts and/or work - or to just take in the passage of traffic, and time.  There are very few places wherein I can find sanctuary in the middle of the city.  During the summer, Ro Ho En (Japanese Gardens) is closed. Also, neither it, nor South Mountain park is accessible at night.  So, this place has become my sanctuary.   That is, until my peaceful serenity, lost in my thoughts and work; is summarily interrupted by the craziness of the 2:30 AM hour.  That is then my cue to head home to my Beloved!",

It doesn't really feel like it's part of a larger chain, which it is.  Love the goofy clocks on the wall with the times of different Arizona cities (all the same time of course).  Not an extremely inexpensive place to eat as diners go, but it's reasonably priced. Specials, if any, are posted by the front door. The kids menu is great and each meal includes a drink. The service seems much better during breakfast hours, which is when I would recommend your eat at Jerry's anyway.  Not for the person with a gourmet palate wanting trendy offerings. But if you yearn for traditional American style food and traditional service, Jerry's will fill the bill.",

The place was dead, definitely suspected bait and switch. My dad had the soup and salad. The salad looked old and the New England clam chowder was over cooked. My brother ordered the liver and onions (I know, liver and onions - but come on, our wives won't cook it for us). The liver appeared to resemble a shoe heal.... it was flat and way over cooked. I played it safe and got the country fried steak. It was ok. The side of lukewarm canned corn made me wonder when the food inspectors lasted conducted a temperature check.  Not sure how this place got 3.5 stars.... it must have been after last call.",

Food is a major upgrade from dennys and related however the overall menu is somewhat similar.  I had dinner and breakfast here but the dinner was taken from the lunch menu and its just a sammich.   The bfast portions were generous. The flavors were whatever. Nothing salsa or ketchup couldnt remedy.  Pricing is similar to dennys too running $10-15 per head.

Another waitress stepped up and helped us. Brought my chips and salsa out. Salsa was in small plastic cup. Barely enough for 3 chips. The chips were terrible, burned and tough. She recommended the French dip. Bread was hard and meat tasted terrible. On a plus, we came here 2 nights ago and everything was great!! Try the chicken fried steak, been good by all who tried it. Also recommend hamburger steak. Wendy was rude when we kept telling her how everything was messed up. More people joined us from the Hotel and she kept complaining. To me, they would be happy to have more customers. Try at your own risk. One night it was great, tonight was worse possible ever!",

I was hesitant due to some of these reviews but I will DEFINITELY be returning soon! Wait staff and management were more than attentive. Not one table was missed or left hangin' (I was at the counter and could see the whole restaurant). Not one plate sent back. My chicken fried steak was perfect! The gravy was thick, seasoned well and had sausage chunks throughout, unlike some of these places where you just get peppered wallpaper paste. My eggs were just fine. The toast came slightly over-buttered which I LOVED! I have zero complaints and believe me when I say I'm particular about my breakfasts. Ignore these complaints and find out for yourself! I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

Prices are super reasonable considering the quantity and quality of food you get.  Service is relaxed and staff is always super friendly and cheerful to everyone.  It's a place where you feel free to pick up a section of the daily newspaper and enjoy your breakfast.  The menu is a mixture of tried-and-True roadside diner fare mixed in with some creative daily specials that are always worth a try.    My personal fave for breakfast are the Eggs Benedict..  Yeah, the Hollandaise sauce is probably from Sysco (does anyone really think any restaurant makes Hollandaise sauce from scratch anymore???)  -- but the eggs are poached perfectly and served up on a toasted English muffin topped with ham  and served with a very generous serving of home fries or hash-browns.      If you have a serious sweet tooth --  try the homemade cinnamon rolls.  These things are the size of a hubcap from a '55 Buick and yummy-yummy.  Or if you are in the mood for coffee and a great dessert -- try the homemade cakes. The cakes are always homemade from scratch and I've never had one that wasn't incredible. The Red Velvet cake is my best-est fave, followed by the carrot cake.",

The food was underpar. I could tell the eggs for the omelet were the fake ones, and the hash (if that's what you can call it) was stringy and mushy, I also felt like it tasted a little too old. The veggies seemed fresh, and the toast was okay. For $10 after tip I will probably never be back. If you like places like Denny's I would go as far as to say this is better than that, but with so many more options in this area I personally don't think it can compete. I would recommend The Acacia Cafe or Berthas up on Indian School.",

Amazing meal, no, but if you've been out late, and don't want a ....burto's of any kind, go to Jerry's.  They are never super busy, but there are often groups of older regulars (which for me is fun to see!)  The decor is fun, not like a run down Denny's.  And the staff is VERY fast and very friendly...have even come to open the door for us before we made it to the curb!  This place is VERY close to us, so we will be returning often!  Easy for people to not know it exists...in a spot too close to the freeway, and not near anything else heavily visited...but worth checking out!!",

The service was decent, not fantastic and the food was standard... better than Denny's though.  It was fresh and filled my belly.  Took a little flagging down to get more coffee but nothing that would stop me from coming again.  I LOVE my breakfast and this... well it did the trick.  Nothing was overly greasy... eggs cooked to perfection... but its pretty hard to mess up eggs and bacon.

Since it was Friday, they offered AYCE fish and chips.  Even though the only waitress was overwhelmed since there were almost 5000 men in town for the conference, she did her best and got us our meal.  The fish was fresh and light, not greasy and obviously hand breaded, large pieces too, and the fries were old school, loved them.  Been there since 1966.  Not the best meal I've had, but one of the best fish and chip dinner's I've had a diner.  Open 24 hours.  A bit nostalgic.",

More like undercooked and tough * The vegetables are terrible - they taste exactly like the kind you get from a frozen bag * The fried chicken was apparently edible * The bathroom was dank and dark and felt like the kind of bathroom used by horror movies  Sorry Jerry's Restaurant but your food is terrible.

Before Jerry's my go to diner was 5 and Diner. Don't get me wrong I like 5 and Diner, but I love places that aren't Chains.  Jerry's is just a laid back diner, where I think after a few visits they learn your names and you become family. The waitress we usually get seems to remember us each time we go back.  I have ordered the Fried Chicken, which was top notch! So flavorful and crunchy. I loved that the first time we went they only had one more serving so my friend and I couldn't both get the fried chicken. I mean he was a little bent, but I got to eat the chicken. And the fact that it is so popular that you are \"lucky\" if you get to order it!  I have also been back for Friday Night Fish Fry. The Fish Fry is really good fish and probably the best  tartar sauce of any diner I have been too!  Don't forget the Cinnamon Roll with whipped butter...So sinfully delicious! I feel guilty eating it its almost too good!  This is definitely a place I will be frequenting! I might even get a booth that is my booth!",

I usually get the hungry traveler, which is 2 eggs, 3 sausage links, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, and unlimited pancakes... For around $8. Sometimes it comes out good, sometimes it comes out not-so-good. The hash browns are typically great, nice and crispy. The last time I stopped by and got that same meal, my hash browns were a soggy mess; so I asked the waitress if I can have them cooked a little more crispy. She came back 10 minutes later with a new order of hash browns, that were a soggy mess. I said that I had asked for them a little more crispy, and she said \"well that's how we cook them here\". I know that's not True, I don't think that any restaurant at all would prefer to serve undercooked hash browns. But whatever, that server was probably just having a bad day. The pancakes are always great every time.",

It could be from a bad experience in my childhood that I don't quite remember, but I think it's starting to go away.  The husband and I decided to come here because we are leaving for Washington for 6 weeks this weekend and we were on a mission to only try new places to eat our last weekend here.  We stopped by for breakfast on Saturday morning.  There were very few people in here, maybe 5 or 6 tables so we were immediately seated.  Our server was super nice in that cool-mom type of way.  She got our drinks quickly and refilled them often.  After a couple minutes perusing the menu and seeing lots of tasty things, I decided on the Rock and Roll Waffles, which is a thick waffle with bacon and eggs sitting on top of it.  Every time I order something like this, where there is supposed to be stuff on top of something else, they always serve it on the side.  Oh well.  The husband and I also decided to split a cinnamon roll as a pre-breakfast app.    The cinnamon roll was delicious.  It was sweet and gooey with just the right amount of cinnamon.  It was also one of those fabulously soft and chewy ones, not a crusty one.  It was especially delicious with a little bit of butter on it.  My waffle was also fantastic with a crispy outside and a surprisingly fluffy interior.  I didn't so much like the scrambled eggs, they were kind of flavorless, but I don't really like eggs anyway, so it doesn't matter.  The bacon was pretty good, nice and salty and a little bit thick.    I will definitely go back again in the future.  I loved the old school vibe going on with this place and I love that I get better food at a better price with better service than I would get at any Denny's or IHOP.",

However, when you have a single server working the breakfast shift and 15 or more people unexpectedly show up, it's time for you to come out of the managers office and fill coffee, run the cash register, or serve food.  I saw you for 15 seconds walk by and then never saw you again. I have a feeling you would hold your server accountable for any complaints received during such a rush. When your people need help, it's your role to step up. There was no other place to post this, so I hope it makes it to your attention.",

I should have asked exactly what kind of turkey they used (do they roast their own, turkey breast, etc.) It shows up and looks like the cook ran over to the market and picked up a package of Carl Buddig turkey, plopped it on some white bread and tossed some gravy on it.  I tried to eat it, but I could make that happen.  I called my server over and asked her for something else.  I ordered the ground sirloin plate. Basically the same thing as the turkey sandwich except there was a hamburger patty covered in gravy, mashed potatoes covered in gravy, a bowl of peas, salad and a piece of corn bread.  It was tolerable.    I suggested to the server that maybe they should get some real turkey and bump up the price a bit to make the plate a bit more appetizing.  As for the hamburger patty, could it kill them to have some ground beef in the fridge and make up a handmade patty instead of using a puny hamburger patty?  The place has some interesting food advertisements on the wall touting their excellent this and their fabulous that.  Perhaps Jerry should reevaluate what is being pushed on to the customers and perhaps the place would be a bit busier.  I'm wondering how breakfast is?",

It gets 4 stars because sometimes they are understaffed and takes a bit to get service.  But when I go, I'm usually not in a hurry anyways.  The staff is always friendly day or night. Even a simple side salad is fresh and deserving of props.  The awesome thing is the fresh desserts and pie will satisfy any drunk or Sunday camper.

Food haphazardly slapped together: preformed fish, not proper filets, thinly breaded, not battered, tasteless, dry.

Biscuits: only half my order arrived--were a few thin separated layers--flabby, flavorless and doughy-flat, tossed around in a styrofoam box. BISCUITS? Flaky, real biscuits? Hardly. Just a couple of cold tiny thin pancakes. 'Butter' was a bit of margarine, chips nothing to speak of. Cornbread dry, flavorless, sad. All of this for $40, plus PostMates' delivery company's charge of $10, which driver doesn't get, plus his $5--insane. Next morning, left message w/ server for manager 'Sheldon'. He didn't even bother to call back. Nice.",

Our waitress was pleasant at the beginning and promptly brought my sons pancake. However 45 minutes later my 2year old was way over this and our food was nowhere in sight for mother and grandma. The waitress was highly defensive when grandma made a comment about order being lost. Was rude and adamant that it was the cooks fault not hers.... Then we get the food to go and my anticipated homemade chili turned out to be more like brown mush aka canned chili  gross food terrible service.",

I  wasn't crazy about the food at all either, would've been better off going to an IHOP or Denny's. A large fly also landed on my glass, my boyfriend attempted to shoo it away although the fly fell into my glass instead.  Yuck! Upon heading to pay I let the waiter know about the fly in my drink and he once again apologized and said \"I know you guys come in pretty frequently, like once a week so I've got you next time.\" Not True; This was only our second visit and last.  Shows me the sincerity was not actually sincere at all.",

    "text": "I hated this place! Okay my boyfriend and I stopped here on Easter because everywhere else we tried was packed even though it was still early in the morning. When we walked in we were sat right away and asked what we wanted to drink. Not a second after the lady leaves with our drink order, another waitress come up and asked the same thing. So we tell her we have already ordered drinks, and she proceeds to ask us what we wanted to order. I mean during all of this it was less than five minutes, so of course we needed time to look over the menu.  The menu had a minimal number of food offerings BUT they had multiple variations. I guess they have the ability to scramble eggs 50 plus ways, because the menus was just a rundown of what consisted on the prior page of the menu. My boyfriend ordered a omelet that came with a side of toast, and I just ordered French fries. At this point I didn't want to be there. The waitress asked me multiple times if I just wanted fries as if I had to order more.  So the food comes out and it looks as if it were cooked in dirty grease, I've never seen an omelet so brown. My fries were definitely out of one of those frozen bags and the portion size was a bit pitiful. Here's the WORST part of all. When the waitress brought the food, she brought the check! That felt as if she wanted us to hurry and leave. Although it was rude in my opinion, I ate hurriedly because I was in a horrible mood and wanted to get out of this strange place fast!  With the food offerings, the actual food, the customer service and the environment...I will never visit this place again.",

I'm from Indiana, and it reminds me of a good ol' southern home style restaurant back in Indy. I always sit at the counter and love to watch the waiters get everyone's order. Man, they work so hard, and they are so polite. Customer service is top notch here!  We always end up here for breakfast. I get the meal that comes with biscuits and gravy, two eggs, bacon or sausage, and an optional side of hash browns. It's really good! Everything else they serve looks good too. I like to food watch. LOL I'm gonna have to try the French toast next time.  And there WILL be a next time and a next and a next . . .",

    "text": "Excellent accidental find.  We happen to be at a conference next door and when we got out we figured what the heck and we were hungry. What a pleasant find. From the moment we walked through the door we felt as if we had gone back in time to the old diner days when we got real homemade cooking. I have a real weakness for Chicken fried steak and this was some of the best I have had with fresh mashed potatoes and gravy. Came with corn and I ordered some corn bread to to top it off.  Corn bread was ok but processed.  Everything was fresh and delicious. So I had a quick thought that an old time diner might have a good milkshake. So I ordered and she said it would take about 10 minutes to prepare. It was fresh and delicious like we used to get. Everyone at the table took a taste and loved it.  Everyone was great done to the table buser. He was fun and attentive. I wanted to call our server 'Flo or Madge' and unfortunately forgot her name. On the way out I looked back into the kitchen and there was one cook working there so was surprised the service was so fast. I could not resist so waited until he looked out and gave him a thumbs up!   If you find yourself in the Thomas and 24th at area and want a good, fresh old time meal give this place a try. Skip the drive through and sit down for a real meal. We loved it and will be back.",

    "text": "If you're reading this on your mobile device, this review boils down to this:  If I lived nearby, I would eat here once a week.  I was staying at the hotel next door and after having mexican food for the past three days, I was looking for some comfort food.  I found the reviews on Yelp and seeing they served breakfast 24-7, I decided to walk on over.  I stopped in around 6:30 on a weekday evening and the place was pretty empty.  I was seated at a booth and was immediately greeted by my server.  Think Vera from \"Mel's Diner.\"  She was terrific.  One of the specials was a bowl of green chili with rice or beans for $9.99.  I am a sucker for green chili whenever I'm out west.  I explained to Vera that I wanted to eat a bunch and if I was eating pancakes, I didn't have room for rice or beans.  She said it would be no problem just to get the chili by itself.  To go with the chili, I ordered pancakes and sausage, as well as an order of hash browns.  If there was a downside to my visit, it was that service was slow.  Like \"we fresh cut the potatoes for your hash browns\" slow.  Which was not a big deal to me because I had nowhere to be, but would have been a problem if I had been in a hurry.  The chili was great.  It had beef in it and I loved it.  The pancakes were terrific.  The sausage was familiar and average.  The hash browns were okay, but would have been better if they had been well done.  Next time, I'll ask for them that way.  For desert, I grabbed a slice of banana bread CAKE to go.  Yes you read that right, banana bread CAKE.  It was great.  All their cakes are homemade and they also had lemon, chocolate, and strawberry cake.  They also served pies, but they weren't made in-house, so I passed.  All in all, a great diner that I'd be happy to stop by the next time I'm in the area!!",

I hate to do this because whoever checks these reviews from Jerry's, probably know who I am (tells you how much my family used to eat there lol). I usually just order chicken tenders and fries, but they've even screwed up on that. Sometimes, I don't eat them because the first taste they are cold, so much so I thought it was undercooked (it wasn't, but its appalling). Then some other family members have complained that there food just tastes bad. Not sure what's happened to Jerry's, but I hope they can fix it.",

Took 15 minutes to get seated despite obviously open and clean booths. 19 minutes to get waters and another 15 for the waitress to take our orders.  At least a nice meal is worth waiting for, but the food was mediocre at best. Place was probably understaffed, but the waitress barely said a word.  Would recommend Carl's Jr. right up the street over this dump.",
