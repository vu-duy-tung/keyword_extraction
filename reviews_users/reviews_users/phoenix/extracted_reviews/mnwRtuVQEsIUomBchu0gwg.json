They're basically straight champagne!",

The food was as follows:  Appetizer was chips and guac (one of my favs). My biggest pet peeve lately is that restaurants seem to think its necessary to sweeten what should be a savory food. The guac would have been amazing with all its numerous ingredients less the cherries...I mean seriously!  Cherries are meant for drinks and dessert not guacamole.   Meals were as follows: My friend ordered a blackened salmon sandwich which came out way overcooked.  I ordered a salad with salmon and the plate was piled high with greens and very little of the other items such as pears and cheese and the server forgot my salmon for which he brought to me after we let him know and it was cooked to PERFECTION!  My friend took a bite of mine and was saddened that his was so tough and mine so good. The server did comp us for the salmon which I thought was very nice. These guys just need to work on consistency and maybe take the cherries out of the guac.",

We went for the brunch for the first time the other day and WOW. Best bloody mary I have ever had. How can you go wrong with a giant piece of beef jerky to mix it with! The monster mimosa's are just that, monster and delicious.  The biscuits and gravy are the best I have had since I moved to AZ. I tried everyone elses food and it was awesome as well but they were all into my biscuits.   My favorite dinner dish is the gnocchi but literally everything on the menu is awesome.

They usually have a nice crowd in the back patio, with a handful of furry happily wagging pups. If you're not into the dog-friendly environment, the front patio or inside seating is really nice as well. The wait staff is wonderfully attentive, and ive never had a bad experience the many times i have been here. There are great menu options and a good assortment of local beers..they have an orange blossom beer that i really like. My favorite things on the menu are the cobb salad, and the Salmon blt.  Parking is a bit of a nuisance, but they have complementary valet that helps the issue. This location. Is extremely convenient, and its right off of the canal path. One of my favorite weekend events is to bike over with our pup. Its great exercise and you get to enjoy a beer at the end of it!",

Like, if you go here, you will see some dogs. Obviously this is a good thing, and there were some pretty good dogs when I went. There was one dog that was a bulldog and he was really round and stout like somebody put legs on a giant meatloaf. There was also a skinny dog that was wide-eyed and crazy looking. I give each of those dogs a rating of 4-stars as well. If you have a fine dog, I suggest you bring it with you, and I think they even had complimentary dog treats.",

Nice outside dog-friendly patio, but be aware that on a nice day the wait for a table may take quite a while - we were told 45 minutes. Nah....maybe for a beer, but never again for a meal.

I spend the majority of my time here.  Love seeing all the different dogs and love all the local beer choices.  I am currently drinking quite a bit of dragoon IPA which they seem to always have on tap.  The prices are fair and the food is great.  I like their small bites menu for late night munchies.  A couple beers split up with a pretzel makes for a good night.    If you have friends in town and want to show them a little local flavor, check this place out.  So many local beers and they also micro-brew in house.  The back patio shows off our great weather, their menu features local ingredients such as the yucca chips.  This place is the epitome of your local bar.",

    "text": "Spent several hours sipping beer and munching on snacks at this awesome pub. First, for everyone who loves to take their beloved dog on field trips: the patio is dog friendly! Now that I've shared that crucial piece of information, I can talk about the other things I like about this establishment: The beer is great. This is the first \"nanobrewery\" I've ever been to, and based on the beer menu, \"nano-\" means a team of brewers that work in small batch to contribute to a beer menu that is full of options. For comparison: on most microbrewery tap lists you'll see maybe six different offerings. O.H.S.O. had over a dozen different beers to sample. The only caveat is that during my visit, at least four of the beers available were orange-flavored wheat ales, but I suspect they usually have a greater variety available. That said, I really liked my beer!  For munching, I ordered a plate of garlic shrimp tacos. They came with spicy cabbage slaw, salsa, and guacamole and I was really, really pleased! The portion size was ideal for a light lung and they were super tasty! The service was good. I totally recommend this place to anyone looking for yummy beer in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "First time at this very popular place! We tried to get a seat on the back patio as the weather was beautiful - but it was a 45 min. wait! Our tummy's just couldn't wait that long so inside it was. But all was good. Our waiter was awesome. When we told him it was our first time at O.H.S.O., he gave us a 'tour' of the happy hour menu, explaining the beers, and just generally answered every question before we could ask.  The happy hour starter of thai-spiced hummus was so good! (I almost embarrassed myself by liking the bowl to get every last bit!) The beet salad followed, and as I usually do, I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with EVERYTHING on the side. I don't know if that's how they always serve it, but the spinach/greens on the plate, surrounded with little bowls containing the red and yellow beets, tomatoes, pecans, goat cheese, dressing. I piled everything on, drizzled on the dressing, and dug in. Very, very good. Fresh greens, the tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, beets yummy and the dressing flavorful. The brisket sandwich was huge! Half was taken home for lunch the next day. Flavorful bbq sauce. The menu indicates this this a staff choice and my son concurred! The spicy green chile pulled pork sandwich and jalapeno slaw was tasty, too! None left to take home, it was that good!  Good selection of beers and other libations. The flights are inexpensive and a great way to taste some of those beers you aren't too sure about!  Our waiter told us that another O.H.S.O is coming to the Paradise Valley Mall area...but didn't know when. That'll be awesome!   Another great find. Can't wait to go back!",

I do appreciate the beer selection (the white chocolate one is my favorite, sweet but not too sweet like so many others!).  The shrimp tacos are passable, salmon flatbread brunch thing was ok.  Same with German sausage plate.    My favorite and the one dish I feel like beats other restaurants is the french toast.

    "text": "O.H.S.O. is one of the many declining restaurants that is propped up by good food and a wide selection of beers and being dragged down by poor service.   I once went there for breakfast and had a waiter that was really spacey and inattentive. He had to be reminded of orders and things he forgot more than once. When I pointed out that fruit on my plate was moldy he took the single moldy piece of fruit off the plate ant set it back on my table reminding me that sometimes these things happen. Really? I've never been served moldy food before. That is disgusting and the completely wrong attitude.   I took that experience as a red flag, but didn't think it was damning. Yet another visit clued me in that my money is better spent elsewhere.  I went one night and sat in the bar one weeknight after the dinning room had closed. Just after I ordered food and drinks and group of people went from the bar to the patio to smoke. The patio opening is as wide as the patio so the smoke naturally blows into the bar. I mention the smoke to the bartender who brought our drinks and before I finished speaking she cut me off and said, \"because you're sensitive?\" in a completely inappropriate tone. I should have just left then and there. There is no excuse to be that rude to a guest.   Our food comes and it's less than impressive. The fries in my order were recooked. When the waiter cleared our table he dropped the two uneaten cups of mustard that come with the pretzels on the floor. He was upset because he got mustard on his pants. He wasn't that upset that he'd gotten it on the floor which explains why he left it there. When I left the table I slipped and nearly fell from it. What kind of jackass just dumps something you could slip on in front of your table?   I tried calling the restaurant to voice my discontent and no one would ever pick up the phone. I sent a message through a forum on their website. The response I got back was defensive and told me I should have talked to a manager that night. So should I have talked to the rude bartender or the guy to busy to clean up the mustard from the floor?!?! The message might as well have just been a suggestion of other restaurants to visit instead.",

When I pointed this out to management as likely unsanitary to diners, I was ignored. When I again insisted that this should cease during service, the owner first insisted he hadn't been aware, then stated he had asked them to stop 20 minutes ago. The food was mediocre at best, and in this era of food-borne illness, I would avoid it. If they have so little concern about their diners' health to be tossing around buckets of dust during dinner on a windy day, who knows what's going on in the kitchen.",

Wish I could say the love was returned. For only being open as short of a time as they have been what a dirty place. I sat and watched at least five of the beer taps constantly drip which in turn created rust spots dripping down the same cabinets that were just painted over from German Corner. The food was a two. Brisket sandwich was a gut busting stomach rock and if you are going to try to do breakfast/brunch it really shouldn't be that difficult . As we were leaving we ran into some local food industry people we knew and found out about a back patio which you really wouldn't know was there if it wasn't pointed out. Was hoping for a mind-blowing patio to save our overall experience but ended up being a bar made of 2x4's with a bunch of fruit flies and a not so great view of the Scottsdale drainage canal.

The beer brunch is a great deal; $10 gets you a filling meal and a 10 oz AZ craft beer.  Their green chili dip and hummus are great appetizers - both come with yucca chips and those are amazeballs!  The grilled cheese and hot pastrami are my two favorite meals there.  The Sunday BBQ on the patio is a crazy amount of great BBQ food.  It's endless, but I have no idea who can get a second helping.  I still have yet to try their late night menu or bloody marys, both of which look promising.  The service is hit or miss...everyone is always very nice, just not always prompt.  Which is ok, because usually when we go it's to hang out for a while and try a few new beers on tap in addition to a meal.  Their patio is great, and is dog friendly which is always a good thing.  They have homemade doggie treats also, which are a big hit with the pups.  Thanks for being a great local spot!!",

Perfect kind of place to ride your bike to - location is very North East Phoenix in the Arcadia neighborhood. The ambiance  -  It felt to me a little bit like being at a friend's house.  Inside - very comfortable - not stuffy at all.  Outside patio seating is really welcoming.   Love seeing the orange umbrellas on the patio facing Indian School Rd. - It just looks like HAPPY!  While were there we saw all ages, even some little kids with mommies having a 'girls' lunch'.  Plenty of variety on the menu - Items look really good and interesting spin on casual with a twist - from the familiar burgers  - Yummy with Gouda and bacon - house-made tomato soup to these cute little corn cake sandwiches.  Lots of smaller appetizer items to snack on.  The proprietor - Jon - even came over and introduced himself.  I'd say this would be a great place to meet up with some friends, and try a few new brews, watch a game, with a very decent accompaniment of tasty small plates or bigger meals.",

    "text": "I had heard OHSO was dog-friendly but I was completely struck by the degree. The patio is quite chaotic but if you're a dog-lover, it's a happy chaos. I should have known that it would be super-crowded on a Sunday. Luckily, I only had a dog with me and I was willing to sit at the communal table. So, no wait. I loved all the little touches they did to make dogs feel welcome _ from the paper water bowl with the dog's name written on to the wrapped homemade dog treats. The only thing is with so many dogs, everybody wants to sniff. I had to keep one eye on my pooch to make sure she wasn't pulling her leash and possibly tripping someone.  I love the ambience. The food gets almost as good marks. I went with the \"breakfast bowl\" which had scrambled eggs, cheese, guacamole, potato hash and pico de gallo. It was very solid but not knock-your-socks-off. I was expecting some melted cheese, not sprinkling of grated cheddar and white cheese. Next time I go, I will have to order something more heartier or carby so that I feel really full after. But it's a pretty good brunch deal as it includes either a beer or a mimosa.  I felt weird doing valet for just myself and a dog. So I parked at the nearby Safeway and walked not quite a block. I preferred it over waiting for the valet in a very crowded lot. But I will definitely be back--dog in tow.",

I was expecting a steak and shrimp, but when the dish arrived, you can see in my picture that they were pieces of steak and shrimp. I didn't hate it. It was tasty, and very low carb.   I still prefer the macaroni and cheese whether it be the brisket or the del mar. They have such a wide selection of beers too and you'll definitely find something you'll like. The past few times I've been though, I've been wishing they would have frosty glasses or that the beer would be colder. And that would be my only gripe. I still like this place a lot though!",

The last time I'd been here the popsicle beer was out, so glad we got two pitchers...but let's be honest when it comes to pitchers these days...bring me the big pitchers where I can get five beers and not two and a half please!  I also tried the Winter is Coming and that was the business.  It's not that my friend Matt and his wife shared the Mac Del Mar but they both got it! I must say it was delicious.  I split the Chile burger with my girlfriend and that was on point for the second time.  Matt had ordered up the artichoke dip and that was also legit.

They also have a little area where you can grab water and treats for your pet! I ordered the avocado toast on wheat bread which included 2 over-easy eggs and a slice of tomato. So so good and not too unhealthy! It also came with a side of chopped potatoes which were plain, no seasoning, but tasted good. I love that you get a free mimosa or beer with the brunch special. My mimosa was larger than the menu said it would be but I didn't complain! Haha. The server was attentive at refilling our cucumber waters. Love this place, can't wait to go back!",

No idea how expensive of a lunch I'm about to have. Well OHSO...is Oh So Fine! Cool looking interior, nice bar, friendly hostess and server. Fine looking brewery in deed.  The logo on the menu made me smile. I often will criticize a restaurants menu because most of the time they're thrown together with very little thought. I like the type treatment with a motorcycle graphic.  But what about the beer and food you ask?  The beer I don't know about except that it's extensive and some day I'll be back with a designated driver. The food I can tell you about. I ordered the Angry Bird chicken sandwich, a $15 dollar sandwich. What??? Wow, better be one hella good sandwich. And the soup on the side was kale and chicken. Hmm, sounds bland. Well not the case! I was totally impressed! Fried chicken so good! Sauces really interesting and a spice with an extra kick. Soup had about 30 ingredients and home made chicken broth with an amazing flavor. But that sandwich was worth the price. Delicious and a little different than your average chicken sandwich.  OHSO is outstanding. I'll be back. I'll be back because I want to try the artichoke dip. And I'll be back because I forgot what the heck OHSO stands for. It's on the sign right when I walked in...Outrageous, something something. Ah who cares, I just need to get a beer and try a burger or pastrami. Next time!",

We were about to sit on the patio out front with us alone.  *They offer complimentary valet parking  We had a nice, attentive waitress. We ordered all from the brunch menu. My whole table ordered the Chicken and Waffles. When it came out we were shocked at how huge the single serving portion was. We probably could have just shared it with one other person. It comes out layered. One fresh waffle, a well seasoned, hard fried chicken breast and then another waffle, another breast and then another waffle with FIVE pieces of bacon on top and softened butter on the side and spicy maple syrup (had hot sauce it in - or at least that's what it tasted like). It was a lot of food but it was all delicious and it came with either a free mimosa or a beer. All of it was good. Also, all the water is served with a slice of cucumber in it- super refreshing as always. A nice touch and nice alternative to the usual lemon wedge.   A friend picked this place but we'll for sure be back either as a group or with my family individually. They had a nice option of food for children too. All were happy and we had plenty of space and didn't feel like one of those places where kids are simply 'tolerated' but where they are welcomed. (At least during daylight hours).",

We both ordered the same thing actually.  The green chile pulled pork sandwich with fries.    The spice of the green chile was perfect.  Not overwhelming as some green chile can be.  The slaw made a perfect combo on the sandwich and the bun was so soft and tasted like it was made this morning.   Their fries are perfectly crispy with great seasoning.  No ketchup needed with these fries.  I sat at the bar and was taken care of quite nicely by one of the two bartenders they had on staff.  Love this place and will be back for sure!",

This says more about how much I love Papago Brewery than it does about O.H.S.O., but that's how good this beer is.   Another thing I love? Cream cheese. And at O.H.S.O., they put that on a burger. I can't tell you how good this combo is. It's mouthwatering. Honestly, nothing else I've tried was worth ordering again. That cream cheese, jalapeno burger ruined me. It is so good, that I have to stay away from this place unless I want to start exclusively wearing pants with elastic waistbands.",

So The wait gave me and my best friend a chance to look at the store Products of shirts  and mugs.we ended up purchasing two cool shirts that said #vodka. The shirts were great because the store makes its own vodkaWhat I did love about brunch was with the entree you receive  a large glass a Mimosa for a penny & the mimosas were great Made with great champagne & didn't make it all bubbly for the day. My  choice of brunch  was the chicken and waffles . the waffles were great ,the bacon was cooked perfectly the chicken was seasoned. Great seating areas inside in out. The bar was very chaotic. Only thing I didn't like because it was also a gathering spot for people waiting for tables and to pay for merchandise. I ended up having my server run my card for the peso stuff. He didn't mind. Will be back they next time in Arizona",

Weekends are extremely busy for breakfast and lunch. Valet is probably the best choice or if you bike there they have bike parking behind the patio by the canal. The  menu for the most part is new american but has a variety from pulled pork to stuffed won-tons. I like the late night and happy hour menus too. Ridiculous amount of draft beers and at the inside bar some cool one off scotch whiskies and I think even sakes(maybe it was Asian scotch) to try. If you're trying to be seen or checking out the talent that Scottsdale brings go on a weekend late morning early afternoon but prepare to wait. If you want good beer something to eat and just wanna chill try a weeknight.",

    "text": "Didn't come here for brunch like a lot of Yelpers seemed to have. No, I came on a regular weekday for lunch. I met a good friend and our experience wasn't what I was hoping for. I do love the feeling that this restaurant exudes. It really felt like a cool place to hang out. My buddy T ordered the Cobb Salad ($12) Spring mix, Bacon, baby Tomato, Avocado, Corn, Blue Cheese Crumbles, egg, Cucumber & citrus vinaigrette.  The lettuce was old, the bacon was missing and he said the vinaigrette tasted like ass. Here's the problem. Why did the cold prep station make a salad with old, wilted, gross, spring mix? Why didn't the server look at the salad and refuse to bring it out and tell them to make a new one? Why didn't either notice the bacon was missing? No bueno. T decided that since putting a salad together is pretty basic and he felt it was obvious they couldn't handle it, he would just pass on lunch. The manager took the salad off the bill. I ordered the Green Chile Pork Skillet ($12). Hatch Green Chile's, pulled Pork, roasted Corn, aloha rice, Cotija, Poblano Aioli, and pickled red Onion. The flavors were fine. The portion size was appropriate for the price and it came out steamy hot. It all worked together nicely. There were not a lot of people in the restaurant. The one thing T commented on was that as I was paying my bill and subsequently walking out he noticed the chef, or one of the chefs, chatting away with one of the waitresses by the host stand. T thought it was interesting that the chef had the time to stand around chit chatting @ 1:15 instead of maybe, checking the prep work of his staff since they just had something returned. Nice ambiance. Lousy Parking. Questionable food preparation standards. Fair Pricing. 2 Stars.",

Ambiance is nice, beer was delicious and cold, and the food was great.  The service was solid, and upon finding out that I dabble in home-brewing, he mentioned the ability to come to O.H.S.O. and brew your own with the assistance of the brewmasters.  I was pretty impressed, not many breweries take the time to do something like that - so we downloaded the handy dandy app and were able to see the upcoming dates that were available.  They are currently booked through the end of November, but the concept is so cool that I will check periodically to book a brewing session.  I just love it when you can tell a place has passion for what they do, and this place was no exception.",

They seem too uppity and lose their appeal after the first beer. The first thing that hits me is the valet at the front door. The parking lot is congested and very limited in parking already. Now you get to throw in taking away spots to a \"complimentary valet\" that is worthless. They park your car 30 yards from the front door when you could open up more parking for regular customers. I wasn't even going to use the valet and found them inappropriate, rude, and almost killed my experience before entering the place. Our bartender comped our food after hearing our complaint which was nice but no one should have to apologize for a crappy service that can easily be taken away...I thank you for seeing the problem and addressing your customers.  For the bar itself, the beer is always good and the food is pretty good. The location is  awesome and I will probably come again but I will take a look around and see what can accommodate a more laid back group.",

For $1 you can sample the many local and foreign brews. On the weekend you can stop in for a $10 brunch which includes a drink. They have good bbq, great appetizers, and I haven't had anything I didn't really enjoy and that's a serious plus. For their brunch the flatbread with breakfast on top rocks my socks. I would suggest this to my friends and I'll see you there! :)",

I had the pulled pork, husband had the burger and cheese, 3 yr old had the chicken tenders. Also tried one of their low hop beers. We were all happy that we didn't even feel the desire to try one another's order lol the fries too! They were crunchy throughout and didn't get soggy or hard. My pulled pork had just the right amount of spicy and even though it was really juicy, the bread that it was on served on soaked it up to where the taste of the bread and juice made it even more of a 10!  The burger was flavorful as opposed to places where the patty isn't seasoned enough. The sauce was just the right amount and gave it that extra kick while still keeping that hint of ketchup.  Needless to say we finished everything on our plates and the portions were huge. Reasonable price and service was great! We'll be back for sure!",

Their happy hour prices are spectacular- a pitcher of beer ended up being just a dollar or two more than a glass. Our group of 12 or so had awesome service outside on the front patio. Everything we ordered food-wise was great too- artichoke dip, green chile dip, sandwiches, etc.  My only real quibble here is with the parking. One, the lot is tiny compared to the number of people the place can hold, and parking is very tight. Secondly, there is optional valet parking, which is apparently free but that fact isn't well marked anywhere that we saw. The stop and go of the valet parking tends to get in the way of the non-valet parking and overall it seems like there is no real benefit to having the valet.",

    "text": "I've been to OHSO once before and it didn't inspire a review one way or another. This time I felt the urge.  Of the lengthy beer menu, OHSO has 3 of their own in-house brews. Two of which they were out of which is ok because the one left was an IPA. I like IPAs, this was not an IPA. It was bad. This \"IPA\" came in a pitcher. It reminded me of those beers that are made by another brewery but have a different label slapped on the bottle. My buddy and I couldn't finish it. It had the bottom of the keg, sat too long in the lines taste to it. Did I mention, not good? On to the next beer, a guest beer, Mother Road, it was advertised as hoppy and malty... What was I thinking? I hate mixing my malts with hops and verse vicea. Once again, it tasted like it was long in the lines. I peered over at the bar, crap, these guys have like 30 taps! I'll never get a fresh beer unless I get the same that everyone else gets. Lame. It's not a brewery but a tap house. Crap.   After BSing about all things dude, our food comes. I ordered a cheeseburger. The meat was HOT and cooked properly but the rest was just a mess. The bun was waaaay too big for the patty, two small slices of roma tomato and a rib of romaine were dwarfed by the bready top and fat soaked bottom. The bacon must have been sliced by a Ginsu knife because you could read through it. And if I didn't see the cheese, I would not have known it was there. The fries were good; crispy and salty. I expected more from an $11 burger and fries. So after a couple trips to OHSO, I'll now be referring to it as NOTSO, as in \"Did you like it?\" NOTSO much.",

It obviously wasn't cooked or prepared properly, whatever the reason may be, but I got sick the next morning and was sick for the next 3 days. Other than that, our server was stuck up and condescending to us at first, after he realized we were under 21 and not here to drink, but he must have thought that I noticed because after two comments that my boyfriend and I noticed were a little rude, he gave us great service and I ended up thanking him for good service before we left. Still it was that first encounter. Neither one of us are 21, so we don't go out to new places for drinks just yet, but it doesn't matter. He was very condescending to us once we said we were under 21, which meant to him we must have been a couple of kids. And even if we WERE just kids, which we AREN'T, we didn't need to be talked down to just because we aren't 21, but love breweries and brewery food.",

    "text": "Haven't been to OHSO for over a year! Revisited because I was meeting a friend who lives near the Indian School location. It was hopping with activity due to it being Friday and Happy Hour. We opted for patio seating due to the great weather. It was a 20 minute wait but we had a beer in the interior while we waited. Service was friendly at both areas- the interior bar & the patio. We enjoyed a sampling of the $3 small plates which were all very good. My one pet peeve is the fact they have this awesome beer selection but, you get it served in unfrosted glasses. I love having my beer Cold and when I get it in a warm/hot fresh out of the dishwasher glass- it just leaves me disappointed . That being said it was a pleasant evening and reasonably priced as well!",

An awesome list of brews, AND they make their own spirits, too! I'll be back to try the whiskey flight, and maybe some flavored vodka? So unique!   The food was great, too - my S/O and I ordered a burger to split, and the kitchen was so kind as to cut the burger in half for us and serve it on two plates - both with fries!   Our server was a little brusque, but nothing to keep us from coming back. See you soon, OHSO!",

There were maybe 15 of us in our party one point.   Our waiter was sooooo slow. He would take a few drink orders at a time and at one point it took 21 minutes to get a drink. We timed it.   One person  ordered a beer and about 10 minutes later when he asked the location of his drink, he was told they didn't have that beer anymore. The waiter had not e en come back to the table to tell him that and ask if he'd like a different beer. Also, the waiter did not tell us the kitchen was closing, so when he finally got around to taking out food orders, he informed us that the kitchen was closed and there was only a small late night menu we could order from. At that point many of us had been there for over an hour.   I used to live up by the  PV location and never had this type of lackadaisical service. Arcadia, you need to step up your game because you left a bad taste in the mouths of 15 people.",

The inside is very cool and they have a really nice patio (it was way too hot to sit out there yesterday, but they had the doors open and misters on which was nice).   If you're into beer, they have a huge beer list with mostly local beers, and the majority of those are OHSO beers. My boyfriend had the Three Ravens, Boom! Dynamite and Peanut Butter Jelly Time and he really like them all. The peanut butter one legitimately tasted like PB&J, so cool!   I stuck with mimosas yesterday, and they're really good too. They also give you the good ones in wine glasses, and they were only $8 each so a much better deal than most places :) I had the chicken and waffles, which comes with a spicy syrup. That was kind of weird for me, but not bad! Definitely not too spicy either if that's not your thing. He got the classic breakfast which looked really good as well.   I can't remember what the server's name was, but he was great too. Super helpful when it came to questions about what to order and he was very friendly and always there when we needed anything. I'll definitely be coming back here for brunch and to try dinner, too!",

Skip the braised pork though.  The taste and size is not worth the price. $25 for a tiny plate, meh meat, undercooked veggies, and potatoes that didn't have flavor but served as a paste to hold everything together. THIS plate made this review  4 stars instead of 5. It was THAT disappointing.   However, they make their own vodka flavors, gin, jerky, and beer.  Fuuuuuuuuu so yummy. Will travel from California again for this  place, but STRONGLY advise against against against their braised pork rib plate!!!",

Don't get a salad unless you just want $15 worth of lettuce and a few scarce toppings. Maybe they're under new management but it seems in the last year or two it's gone downhill.

Staff was nice and the food was delicious (I got the brisket sandwich - omg amazing). The food and my cocktail came out fast.   Dog friendly: the waitress almost immediately brought a bowl of water for my dog and a treat. She liked the treat. Although OHSO doesn't have a dog \"menu,\" the waitress did recommend the turkey pattie, which I ordered and my dog enjoyed.   I will definitely come back here. The only thing I didn't like (which wasn't bad enough to knock off a star) was that all the tables are raised which made me farther away from my pup than I generally like. People with smaller dogs just put their dog on the bench with them but that didn't seem appropriate for my 70lb - 8mo old rottie. Overall good experience and great food.",

I ordered the breakfast bowl and added steak to it. We also ordered the garlic pesto hummus to share. Everything was actually very delicious. The portions are a pretty good size because I couldn't finish everything. Another good thing is if you order something on their brunch menu on Saturday or Sunday you get a 10 oz beer or Mimosa with your meal. Score!   I absolutely love that the patio is dog friendly! There were so many cute doggies there and it's a very good sized patio. I'm not sure if they do reservations, however if they do, i recommend getting one if you're sitting on the patio on a weekend. I came back here with my fiance on another Sunday and it was so packed that it was an hour wait so we ended up having to go else where. Other then the wait, everything was fantastic! I can't wait to come back with my furbabies!",

The waffles are served with butter and syrup that has a little bite to it and tastes great with the chicken. Am I done? NO! it also comes with three delicious bacon pieces. Get that weekend brunch vibe going strong with a penny mimosa- which is a half bottle of champagne and amazing. OHSO is known for its dog friendly patios and furry friends are in abundance out there. There are two hostesses stands at this location- one for inside and front patio and one for back patio. Back patio is where it's at if it's not too hot. They have free homemade dog treats! My pups approve. I would love to say I've tried something else on the brunch menu but I can't stray away from those darn chicken and waffles. I'm loyal or obsessed or a stage 5 clinger. Dinner at OHSO is alright (I've had the salmon entree) but not as earth shattering as brunch.",

I'd call it mediocre. Really don't come here for the food. Unfortunate because we were really hungry and hoping for a great meal. I'd say the star of the show were my sweet potato fries. But I never met a sweet potato fry I didn't like.   Although it was a Monday, it was also very empty. I'm assuming there are better places to go.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  As a child I hated hamburgers, but I think it was because the ones my Mom made were severely dry (I'm talking must chew for hours and wash down with large quantities of water) on wonder buns.  I have been known to hide these suckers everywhere just to get out of eating them.  I am pretty sure she still finds fossilized burgers in all parts of the house.    I was then introduced to a real burger in Los Angeles.  Everywhere you turn you can find an amazing burger.  One you crave. Stout, Father's Office, Umami, the Counter etc etc etc  Unfortunately after having these burgers a plain ole mediocre burger just doesn't live up.  That was OHSO's burger.  It was okay, but I don't have dirty dreams about it.    While the burger was subpar the atmosphere made up for it.  Casual and comfortable place to come enjoy some drinks, but probably pass on the food. Although next time I will try something different. Highly recommend sitting on the patio and enjoying a cold one with some friends.  This is on the bike path which is always a bonus since I can ride my bike, have some drinks and then try to ride bike home.  Unfortunately we didn't have any beer (which they have a great selection of microbrews) but they did have a Happy Hour going on. The server said all AZ pitchers of beer and glasses of wine were $6.  Mon-Fri 11am-6pm  The kids meal was just Kraft Mac and Cheese.  This is a pet peeve of mine as I prefer if they are going to have Mac and cheese at least make it instead of have it from a box.  My daughter of course ate it right up since she never gets that stuff at home.  I know I am the worst mom ever.  Who deprives their child of Kraft Mac and Cheese?  *My Mom's not a bad cook, just her burgers are horrendous.",

The only beer you can have a pint of are three beers that are not on the tasting menu.  The beers on the tasting menu are excellent, however they don't want you to get drunk on you just drinking beer so you're not able to purchase more then the tasting menu size of the beer.  As far as the food, the calamari is over breaded, but the tuna is nicely cooked. The burger that they are known for is a nice burger, however there were no jalapenos on ours, and enough cream cheese to fill 18 bagels.  Mediocre food, mediocre bar, mediocre beer.

One time, three of us, with three dogs,  sat on the patio, and we were moved by the waitress for no visible or coherent reason into a back corner where she proceeded to serve other people first.  AND...they've added valet.  I love valet when it's an option.  I DESPISE valet when it's not optional. It's not really optional here.  If it wasn't a super dog friendly place with decent beer, it would be straight 2 stars.  Eat before you go.  Food is SERIOUSLY gross.

My girlfriend ordered a salad that looked wonderful when it arrived.  About half way through she bit in something hard, it was a very large bolt!  It was quite shocking when she pulled it out of her mouth.  We immediately asked the waitress for a manager to show her the problem.  The waitress was attentive however the manager (Xenia Lyckowski) was absolutely horrible, not only did she not seem like she cared, she was almost argumentative.  Someone could have chocked and died on this bolt, it was approximately 1-1.5 inch heavy duty bolt.   She offered our friend a comp'd meal that was approximately $30.  This could have resulted in a death worst case or a crown breaking which is very costly and painful.  The manager barely apologized, it was the most random bizarre experience.  I do not not understand how no one even cared.   Sad.....",

We pulled up and did their free valet parking. It is a bit odd how they have two totally separate queues for the front and back, but since we had the puppy, we walked to the back. (Actually, my biggest complaint was the very dark and odd walk to the back).  The back porch was quite happening. It was clear they cater to dogs and cyclists. Dogs + Bikes + beer == awesome!  We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but it wasn't too bad (most natives fled the heat that weekend). Our server was prompt and helpful. My burger was really good too. They did mess up my wife's dinner but were very fast to fix it and apologize.  Again, this is a rather delayed review, but I remember really liking the beer! Nice mix of flavors and interesting non-hop-head options for my wife!  Also, like a lot of breweries, they turn their spent barley into dog treats. However, here, they didn't even charge for them.  I am a bit embarrassed to talk about this, but I tried one. Queue me fighting with the dog over who got to eat the rest of them! They were really good. I highly recommend them (and I am surprised they aren't selling them as crackers on the menu!)",

The misters blew in through the open doorways into a small, darkened dining room. My boyfriend and I opted for an unlit table inside the unoccupied indoor space. Secretly, I wanted to sit outside, but I accepted our loner status in the corner and inability to read the menu so as to appease the love of my life.   The service was great. The dude was really cool but he obviously got the vibe we were kinda chillin' doin' our own thing. We never needed anything; it was always provided before I knew I wanted it.  Started with the Viking Porter. Tasty. The server offered to let me try a sample of their house-made vodkas. I ended up trying the jalepeno vodka. It was incredibly smooth! Even boyfriend tolerated it and he does not like straight liquor. I ended up ordering a drink with that was made with lime and the house-made cucumber vodka. Simple and delicious. Boyfriend also had a mixed drink that was pricey but enjoyable.   I WANTED SO BADLY TO TRY THE BREWER'S BOARD. But every time we go to a brewery we order 8 million appetizers and then entrees and before we eat we drink too much beer anyway and then there's all this food leftover... so we didn't. ONE DAY THO, I WILL COME BACK FOR YOU.   OK. The Food.  I love ribs, so boyfriend really wanted me to get the Beer Braised Shortribs. Ribs don't do it for me as much anymore since I have discovered brisket, so I was leaning towards the Brisket Mac.The server was super cool and even though the ribs cost 10$ more than the mac he was like \"Nah, you don't get a big portion of ribs and the mac and cheese is excellent.\" (this is more of a paraphrase than a quote). But then I was like, Mac Del Mar? And the server said yes so I got it and HOLY COW it was delicious. I could barely finish half of it and it pained me to leave it but I knew the leftovers wouldn't keep well. I definitely ate the entire generous portion of seafood, however. Crab and shrimp with cheese seems so wrong to me but it really, really wasn't.   Boyfriend got the Crispy Pork Belly. We've been watching a lot of cooking shows lately and the chefs are always salivating over pork belly so we've been dying to try some. The presentation was so adorable; it was all fancy. Didn't really notice the ~pineapple gastrique~ on the plate but it was very tasty. Did not disappoint.   The nostalgia-stricken tourist in my soul needed to buy 2 pint glasses on the way out. They were almost double the price that was listed but I didn't really care. They're neat glasses. They got fhat flavor lip ya'know?",

    "text": "Amazing selection of beers on tap. Great happy hour specials. Good food. Friendly service. And a nice patio area during the months that we don't use the phrase \"It will only be 105 degrees today\".  You can get pitchers of on tap local brews for $6-11. The pitchers are plenty generous. The burgers are great. The fish and chips (which in my opinion is the best way to judge any brewery) taste great. It's always a good sign when they bring out malt vinegar without being asked. I prefer the texture of cod to mahi but the breading was tasty and it wasn't a pile of breading with a sliver of fish. The tartar sauce had great flavor and it looked made on site (I've never seen store bought with pickles diced that large).  The only real issue here is the parking. If you show up during busy times, it can be a nightmare. The valet helps. The guys out front are friendly and do not push hard for tips (which of course makes us want to tip them more than we would have had we felt pressured!). It can be a frustration but in the end it is worth it.",

However, I don't go to OHSO to eat...I go there to drink on the patio! The patio is very dog friendly and it's one of the better patios in Phoenix. They have a good list of local beers, craft beers, and mixed drinks. This is a nice place to meet with a group of friends and hang out for a while.   I also appreciate how accommodating the staff has been. I went there to watch the presidential debate and the staff was very willing to put the debate on for me. I had already gone to a few other places and they refused to do it--so I really appreciated OHSO's flexibility on the manner.   Bring your dog, a few friends, and go enjoy a drink on their patio.",

Seated right away, waiter came and took our order, took a very long time  (20+ minutes) to get our appetizer of spinach and crab dip with veggie chips.   Two minutes after we got our appetizer, the waiter brought out our main meal. I told him we just got our appetizer and now the meal is going to be cold, he said he could stick it in the broiler until we're ready because he tried to time the appetizer and meal but the kitchen was behind. We declined and ate.  The appetizer was way tastier than the main meal, I got a burger and fries, boyfriend got the grilled cheese with bacon. We both agreed it was meh, and having to flag down the waiter so we could request refills on our drinks was kind of sucky.  Had a couple of beer samples, the first one the glass wasn't even half full. The second third and fourth were filled to the top, but we weren't charged for the first one. We were there around 8pm and another sample we requested was already out, kind of surprising for a brewery on a Friday night.  Three out of five for the atmosphere and our dogs loved the free dog treats, may have rated higher if we had gone another time.",

I love the cheese plate - such a variety, and then the popcorn on the plate is a cool alternative to chips.  It is all really filling and comes out beautifully presented.  my partner likes the fish tacos they have.  We have had their salads too.  Whatever you have it is all good.  Good food, good atmosphere - what more do you want !",

That said, I think it could easily have been a better value, and I wish that they offered better vegetarian/vegan selections -- I was meeting with a friend who is vegan. This place was great at offering a trendy pub ambience, but I will have to check back in another few months to see how they're doing on everything else.",

The server was awesome. I ordered The Camelback which upset my stomach (probably because I had not eaten since the morning) and also had a beer called the lost highway or something like that. I don't usually like beer, but this beer tasted so freaking good. Definitely will be back to try their other beers! 2 stars for food 1 more for the great service",

Later on with dinner I offered another beer that was never brought, that I oils see sitting at the bar getting warm..had to remind him.

The patio space hugging the canal and looking up to Camelback Mountain is one of my favorite places to meet friends for brunch, with my most loyal friend, my dog! By far one of the most dog friendly patios in town, this Arcadian spot is both equal parts dog friendly bar and darn good bar. I order the orange ale, nearly every time, and have made my way through most of the brunch items - I haven't been disappointed yet! Edie snubs their cookies (she snubs pretty much anything other than meat or cheese snacks), and the servers always welcoming my being me a piece of prosciutto from the kitchen so she can still have OHSO treats. I may be a little more loyal to OHSO now, too, for they validated my obsession with how cute I think my dog is by awarding her one of their \"Growler of the Week\" recognitions! All in all, it's a smart, sweet spot, and it's fun to plan a Sunday Funday of tossing my pup on my bike and pedaling down the canal for scrumptious bites and brew! Biscuits and beer gravy are delicious and they constantly dare me to order them... and they are a worthy reason to pop out of one's denim.",

I used to always get their breakfast flatbread but they changed their flatbread few months ago to this much thicker cracker crust that my friends and I are not a fan of...please bring back the old flatbread crust!...it was so thin, crispy & yummy!

    "text": "We discovered this place in the current Phoenix magazine today. The place has a great look outside, upon arriving and inside was just as pleasant. It has a great patio out back but goodluck finding it. I read that one is to follow the Paw prints on the floor...could not find the Paw prints and had to ask for directions. I did like that they provide Dog biscuits and water out back. We sat down starving, when our very friendly server, Hillary, immediately arrived to welcome us. Being our first time, we were eager to hear about the food but she completely assumed we were there to just drink. Are you pushing the brew here folks or the food? At least ask us why we are there first before you go on and on about the beer. We started out with the Garlic hummus, which was good but it came out rather quickly. I question whether it was freshly made or from Cisco Foods. The cucumbers that came with it, were dried out, gross and rubbery. My partner ordered the Green chili stew Tacos and I had the Barbecue hamburger. Both were ok..it's above average, Bar food and need improvement. One of the tacos had a big piece of gristle. Don't you check your meat chef before you send it out? Complete lack of focus and concern for the quality of the food being sent out.  You might not care for my review but if you care about your brand and what you represent...not just your brewery...you will take our first visit review seriously. I know this may sound harsh but I must remain honest. People may come for great brew but they also for great food.",

However, it took our server at least 7 minutes to greet us (we all had empty beers or hadn't had any beers at all by that time).  When he finally did greet us, it took at least another 10 minutes to get our beers.  The whole night went that way.  We started ordering two beers at a time to make up for the lag in service.  It was disappointing since the atmosphere, beer and food were great. It also took the server 10 minutes after we placed a beer reorder to tell us that one of the kegs had blown and our beer selection was no longer available.  I was afraid to order something else I'm fear that it might take another 10 minutes to finally get my beer. This was my husband and my first time there.  I have to say I may try it again but not at a busy time,  because I hate slow service.",

Our server was a lady who didn't seem to be too on-it but it seemed other servers here were very kind and probably better.  There are lots of cute games like corn hole, and a cute fountain made of beer taps for dogs.  There was a very good special on breakfest/brunch items with a mimosa for $20.  I am pregnant so I couldn't take advantage of that but it was still a great deal!  This is a cute people and dog-watching spot!",

And you can't argue about the great selection of beers they have as well as the very reasonable prices that they offer particularly through happy hour. That being said their choice and preparation of their food is something else to consider.

The smoking situation is still something that should be dealt with, there wasn't anywhere to avoid it on the way out of the establishment.  Allowing the smoking to continue so close to the entrance will cause issues when someone comes along and reports it - for the effort that appears to have been put into this business, I hope there is a solution worked out that allows people to smoke away from the entrance.

    "text": "New to Phoenix, my boyfriend and I enjoy custom brews and good, inexpensive dining. We found O.H.S.O in an online search of restaurants near our home.   We were pleased when we arrived to see that this establishment is dog-friendly (providing water dishes, a spacious back patio, and homemade dog biscuits) since we are a two-tail family. While we did not bring our animals the first trip, we will in the future.  The atmosphere is cozy - well-lit but soft lighting; the music has a wide variety and is kept loud enough to hear but low enough to talk reasonably; the building is clean, modern, and has a good lay out; and heated patios (in the winter) are a nice bonus feature. The price, for a night out for two with drinks, was reasonable.  We were both pleased by the beer selection. The prices were a little high but not terribly so considering the place features local, small breweries. There was an average selection of food, although the menu is limited. I wished there'd been more options for vegetarian or vegan. The establishment could pull in a lot more business (and I'd be able to recommend to more friends) if they offered more than one veggie burger and a few salads for vegetarian/vegan selections. Of the veggie burger (which I had)... delicious and moist, very flavorful. My boyfriend hoovered his fish and chips to indicate how pleased he was with the meal.  All-in-all, I'd recommend this place and return.",

We headed to the bar to order some beer, then stood out on the patio since it was so crowded inside (it was raining, but we are Northwest people, it didn't bother us!).  Just a few minutes after ordering our beer, the hostess found us and brought us to our table!  We were seated much sooner than we expected, which was awesome.   The food turned out to be pretty good.  We ordered the calamari, spinach crab dip, steak and fries, and two flat bread pizzas (yes, we were hungry).  The only thing we weren't big fans of was the Spanish chorizo and potato flatbread pizza.  But we all agreed that the veggie flatbread pizza was delicious.  There was a huge selection of beer from many different breweries - I was surprised that only two of the beers were made by OHSO - but I guess that is why they call it a nano brewery.  I like the ambiance here.  The music is good, and it is just a casual, laid back place to visit with friends while enjoying some good beer and food.  If I wasn't stuck so deep in the suburbs, I would probably come here more often!",

The simplest of requests seemed like a large task. The service is so awful that we won't go anymore. Friends have come into town and we debated bringing them and their dogs but we decided to go elsewhere because we didn't have three hours to kill waiting for bad service. The staff acts like the very basics of their job are a chore and just frankly have ruined the whole experience. I can't imagine why management hasn't noticed or done anything about this other than they might be incompetent as well.

    "text": "On a warm Saturday afternoon, I was shocked to discover the popularity of OHSO.  The back patio was slammed with customers day drinking at 2pm.  A very good sign for any bar.  The reason this microbrewery may be popular is probably because OHSO serves great beer.  I'm not just talking about what they brew on site, but there's a massive selection of craft beers from other microbreweries in Arizona and from around the world.  If you're looking for Bud Light, do yourself a favor and go to any other bar in the country.  If you're looking for something other than beer, there is a decent selection of mixed drinks.   Having never been to OHSO, I decided I should have one of their own and the Citrus Nitro caught my attention after the server called it a \"creamsicle.\"  What a perfect description of what the beer tastes like.  Would you believe a beer flavored like a creamsicle is delicious?  It is.  I also tried the White Chocolate Ale from the Sonoran Brewing Company in Scottsdale.  Also delicious.  Service was great.  I was with a group of about 15 to 20 people, and the waitress had no problem keeping our tabs straight.  There were also tray filled with water glasses constantly delivered to the table without request.  Something desperately needed on a 90 degree day.  The server also was really knowledgeable about the beers on the menu.",

It is a night that will live on in the annals of history. I highly recommend it as an adventure, a group bonding activity, and an opportunity to discover new beers you like.  The food is mighty tasty. I've had sweet potato fries at a lot of places, and these are hands-down the best. They're a little on the salty side, but that's how I like them. If only they offered them with Delux's aioli, then we'd be in business. We also got a meat & cheese plate and the grilled chicken flatbread pizza. They were both quite tasty and disappeared quickly.  Our server was great. We were a big group, and it would be easy to mess up with all of those tasters. But he got everything right and checked in with us regularly. It also didn't hurt that he was a cutey patootey.  The only con was that we were seated in an alcove with two booths, and it got really loud with all the sound bouncing around. I wish they'd put up a curtain between the booths and something on the walls to dampen the sound. For now, I'll just ask for a different table.",

Four visits in the last month is about as regular as it gets for me (two of them in the same weekend as requested by my out-of-town visitors). After running along the canal for months seeing the words \"Friendly Dog Patio\" painted near the back, it was only a matter of time before my pup and I dropped by. We're both big fans!  The wine and beer selections are terrific, and the meatless choices are abundant. Of the hummus, guac, yucca chips, flatbread, veggie burger, fries, arepas, and salads - I have yet to find something that hasn't been delicious. We're not talking epic creative fusion cuisine here, just above-average pub grub. The mixed drinks are okay, but most of them are on the sweet side which isn't my thang. Happy hour prices are spectacular and we've had some stellar service to boot (enough to make up for a couple of service hiccups).  That fifth star awaits the back patio being open during the week. It's glorious with a view facing Camelback Mountain and set under the canal. The front patio view is well...the parking lot. Since I will likely always be outside with my dog, I'd rather not butt up to a piping hot grill. But I will give bonus points for having dog treats and a canine watering station. Woof woof hooray!",

They even have treats to take away for your dogs at home, for free! I had the house made veggie burger, and it was really moist and tasty. I tried two of my friends' beef burgers and was also impressed. It's worth the visit if your in town.",

I remembered reading an article on Chow Bella about places that rock at grilled cheese sandwiches and OHSO was on that list. So last week whilst seeking a grilled cheese and not wanting to surrender to Sonic or 5 & Diner at such a late hour, OHSO popped into mind.  I, indeed, ordered the grilled cheese and truthfully it was good but nothing special (keep in mind I am vegetarian so I ordered it without the bacon that normally comes on it). However, the side salad I ordered was DIVINE. For a such a small salad I was not expecting such a variety of flavor but it was peppery, sweet, tangy... complex. Very, very good. I only had one drink (framboise) but their beer selection was quite good. I noticed they carry Sonoran Brewery's White Chocolate ale which is my all-time favorite. (Sidenote: mix the framboise & the white chocolate ale for ultimate decadence)  The atmosphere is surprisingly cozy - like a little hip cabin with bicycle parts on the walls instead of taxidermy and country lyrics on plaques. I can't quite remember why I avoided trying OHSO for so long but boy have I been missing out all this time. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I'm a little bit of a hippie at heart so I probably am biased when I say that I love this place and it's likely my favorite spot in Arcadia.    A microbrewery with delicious food, a HUGE outdoor patio that's dog-friendly, amicable and helpful staff, and oh, right, did I mention that their beer is amazing?  What's not to like?   Let's start off with food (because I'm a junkie).  I've raved about the Tavern's sweet potato tots, but these guys' sweet potato fries are, impossibly, even better.  How do you make better, better?  I could eat a bucket of these and drink beer and I'd call it a night out.  Chicken salad wrap is great, so is the green chili dip.  Beware of the green chili pulled pork sandwich if you're worried about your bread going soggy (it will).  Overall, the food is a smash.    Brews: huge and fantastic selection.  They regularly rotate out selections as things go in and out of season, so the lineup is always changing.  Some steady favorites of mine: Dragoon IPA, Grand Canyon Amber, and the local Monje Azul (a light beer with a bit of a kick, if you're feeling light beer but want something with more substance than a Coors Light).  Chainsaw and Hefe is good too.  Basically, you can't go wrong.    Environment:  This is what I love about OHSO.  I look at the vibe of this place as sort of like the Vig but much more laid back and friendly.  The outdoor patio in the back is spread out and open - great for socializing.  There are a few TVs so you can keep up with the scores, but not enough around to turn you into a social outcast just sitting there watching TV by yourself.  All in all, the place gives off a very relaxed, vintage villa aura, with a smidge of contemporary to it.  It's sweet.   Complimentary valet, root beer candy at the hostess stand, great people, and the part that doesn't make you feel guilty about leaving your pooch at home: they make homemade dog biscuits from leftover grain from brewing, mixed with peanut butter and some other goodies, so your pup can have a good time too when you get home!  Top-notch service.  I'm hooked for life.",

Coming down from Flagstaff on an evening in late May, my wife and I were looking to celebrate, and remembered seeing this place and feeling intrigued. They still don't have their \"nanoBrewery\" going, but it looks like that's coming soon. What they do have is a beer tap that knocked my socks off. If you like microbrewed beer, this is the place to go. Half the beer list is from Arizona, including some of our favorite Flagstaff breweries, and many excellent Phoenix area breweries. The left side is from slightly further afield. No Bud Light here.  Our biggest disappointment of the evening was that we didn't bring our dog. As soon as we walked in the front door, we saw a flashing sign for a \"Dog Friendly Back Patio.\" The first server we saw told us to sit anywhere, and that the patio was available. When we got out there, the air was cool, the atmosphere was open, and the music was fun but not so loud we couldn't hear each other.   The patio was clean, and well established. Our server was attentive and friendly, but not oppressive.  We didn't have dinner, just the green chile dip (a warm kind of humus), the beet salad, and some beer. All of the above were tasty, and just what we were looking for.   At the end of the evening we went back inside for a performance by the house band, The Persuaders, who were fun to watch.",

Luck would have it that the Valet Parking (free) had just wrapped up and I was directed around back (I don't like others driving my rig). I quickly parked and found the place inside fairly quiet, and the bar up front was mostly filled with what appeared to be regulars, which would be pretty cool, if I was a regular, but I felt invisable...Deduct 1 Star.  I decided to wonder around and get myself into some trouble in order to be noticed, but I accidently stumbled onto the back patio, and THIS is where the cool people were hanging out, because it was still 100* outside, but totally chill (so much for finding trouble). On the way to the back yard I passed the small brewery where all the magic takes place, and I say small because THIS is where the Nano evidently comes from...sweet!  I found a spot at the bar quickly enough, and the patrons at least looked at me, not that I was in need of attention, but at least I didn't feel invisable, but then it also seemed that all were not as drunk and were actually having conversation, which is always fun to listen in and pretend not too by scanning the smart phone....anyway ~ All the many varieties of brewskies were not available on tap in the back, but the lovely bar host was more then willing to venture the several dozen paces to bring what my palette yurned for...but how do I choose? I shot in dark and ordered an Orange Blossum, which was from the keg right in front of me, and selected the Pilgrim (I like turkey and cranberry, and the sprouts were a bonus). It was tasty and well complimented with a side of sweet potatoe fries.  I throughly enjoyed the lovely, and attentive bar host (ya gotta ask for water, if ya want it, tho) who actually asked how I liked the beer, as if to say, \"I'll get you something else, if you don't like it\". It was okay...a bit too fruity. I find out later that samples can be had for $1 a 3oz. shot. As I was contemplating another, but pondering WTF do I order, again, Nick W. comes up behind me and tells me about a beer that he actually brews here and handed me a coozie for his Hops & Dreams...SCORE!!! Others he recommended where the Stella's Groove, Blood Sweat and Beers, and Day Dream.  Since I was holding his coozie, I had to try this hoppie ale of his....smooth!  This was a great time, and I recommend the patio, definently! It's dog friendly and lots of booths and places to stretch out, or belly up to the bar where it becomes more cozy, where you just might score a coozie! They are open late with a Kitchen that serves up a nice variety of burgers, sandwiches, and snacks until midnight.",

OHSO has a wonderful and unique selection of local beers, half of which are their own brew and a selection from other locals and national brews too. We came during brunch and enjoyed a very delicious and spicy Bloody Mary. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the beef jerky stick it came with. Also something to keep in mind if you don't eat beef or are vegetarian as the waitress didn't mention this. The seating is quite comfortable and the outdoor patio is dog friendly.   For the food, we got the brunch special for &10 with came with a plate and a beer/mimosa. Both the vegetarian flatbread and French toast were quite good and large for the price. For the beers, we tried the white chocolate ale and the mr pineapple. Both local favorites and on a bit of the sweeter side if that's your thing. Will definitely have to come back next time we are back in Phoenix!",

So much fun for a beer lover like him. If you are interested in brewing your own beer here, give them a call! Its pretty sweet!! The staff here is very lively, attentive and nice! Nothing like hanging out with friends and crackin jokes with your bartender, or wait staff. On top of all these things they also have great food. We came for their morning special, which is a beer or mimosa along with a few specific dishes for only $10. Can beat that!!! Try their breakfast flat bread, it is delicious! Its been super nice outsdie too, so I recommend going out back and sitting out on the patio! Plenty of shade, fans and misters to keep you cool! Cant wait to go back!!",

M ordered the biscuits & beer gravy for $10 includes your choice of a 10oz AZ beer.  The flatbread was so good.  Flavorful, light thin bread, and baked to perfection.  M's biscuits and beer gravy was very good too.  Why 4 stars?  The service was good but slow.",

Well, it is quite artsy. But no better than a thousand other places where they chill their glasses before pouring beer into them. Bottom line, don't waste your Friday night here.

The patio here is really large, and they are by far the most dog friendly place in town.  They'll bring water bowls for your pups, and even allow them to sit up in the booth with you if you so choose.  I love bringing my two babies here, and they love being able to hang with mama, meet other pups, and get lavished with attention.  And the food and drink options here are definitely spot on!  So many things to choose from, and great specials for happy hour and brunch.  I particularly love the brunch special - you get a beer or mimosa with your brunch meal for $10.  Seriously, how can you beat that!?!  If you like chicken and waffles, I highly recommend giving them a whirl here - they taste even better with a heft mimosa ;)  Definitely bring the dog-family to OHSO to enjoy some great grub!",

When I first walked in I thought it was a small location until I walked around and saw the back patio! It's huge! To my knowledge both the back and front patios are dog friendly. It was also cool to watch them brew beer right in the middle of the restaurant!   The service was great and informative. We asked what our waiter's favorite brew was and he brought out a whole pint for us to try! How nice! My favorite beer was the O.H.S.O. Hoppy. (If you follow my reviews you can tell I'm an IPA person).   Be sure to grab your doggos a treat from the hostess stand before you leave!",

I then ordered the chicken and waffles and received half frozen waffles and super dry chicken (no seriously, the middle of the waffles were ice). I told the server and she took it back and got me another order. The next order was still disgusting (at least the waffles were like warm this time). It was probably one of the most horrible meals I've ever received at any brewery I've been to. How do you mess up chicken and waffles?  To top it off I paid $20 bucks for the meal. She could've at least comped one of my beers...  My gf ordered a burger and it was delicious... maybe I just ordered the wrong item, which is why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1.",

I ordered the avocado toast and ate every last bite. It was SO good. After eating and drinking I felt full but not heavy and bad about myself. They are pet friendly and there were so many dogs on the patio. Dog owners will love this place. At the end we itemized the check and our server was so nice and brought them back with individual clipboards with everything correct.

Everything looked and sounded good but we had just eaten so we weren't looking for more food. Got a flight of OHSO beers. Not the best but definitely not the worst beers I've had. I liked the Popcycle, Boom! Dynamite the most. We had Bug Blue Van from College street which was also delicious! Definitely recommend making a trip here if you haven't been. We sat out on the front porch which had misters and decent shade available. I would have liked to sit outside in the back but it was full. It looked like they can accommodate large parties pretty well. Parking looked ridiculous. They do offer valet. We Ubered which I was happy about once we got to sit and watch people try to come and go. Dog friendly!",

We brought our dog with us to sit in the outdoor area and they had a really cool knee-height tap setup to pour water for your dog into a bowl. They also had free dog biscuit made from left over grain from the brewing process to give to your dog.  We were seated immediately outside on a Saturday around 4pm which was nice.  I had the O.H.S.O. Bright, which was every bit as light, crisp, and floral as described. It's a peefect beer for hot weather. I also ordered a flight of four, but was disappointed that they were out of the blackberry IPA. I loved the mango and pineapple IPA they had. I must have it again. It may even supplant Ballast Point Pineapple Sculpin as one of my favorite beers.  I had the Angry Bird sandwich, which was very tasty. The chicken was nice and the pickled apples were a good complement. The fries were some of the saltier ones I've had but still good.  Overall, this ranks among the top restaurant/breweries I've been to. I can't wait to come back when I visit Phoenix again.",

If you enjoy beer or a mimosa with your brunch make sure you order as beer brunch, which comes with one of those drinks as part of your order. The mimosa glass size is decent wine glass size, not your small Champaign flute like most places. I had the chicken and waffles and really liked it. Came with slices of bacon too! My husband had the biscuits and gravy which he liked as well, but forewarn the sauce has a bit of a kick. This place also gets major kudos for the dog friendly patio and dog treats. Downside is parking but they do offer complementary valet.",

    "text": "If you had asked me a month ago, I would have given this place 5 stars.  Sadly, after my second visit, I feel the need to write this review.  The food and beer selection at O.H.S.O. is pretty great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star.  In fact, my first time here was pretty good.  I thought this would be a go-to when I come to town, but then I had dinner there this past week, and well, I'm never going back.  Now, I admit, I'm a picky eater and I like to modify my dinner.  I live in LA, where almost every single person I know modifies in some form or fashion, and it's rare for that to be an issue.  You would think a restaurant in a city as big as Phoenix would see a lot of that, too.  However...  When it came time for me to order my meal, I started to explain that I would prefer my pizza with no cheese, and a few other items off of it.  The last time I had been there, this was not a problem at all, and that server was happy to help me.  THIS time, I unfortunately was served by Brooke, who not only didn't help me, but she served up a healthy portion of her less-than-helpful attitude.  Upon ordering, she told me \"You could do that - but it's not gonna taste very good\" (in a pretty b****-y tone, mind you).  That's funny - I don't remember asking her opinion of what I wanted to eat!  I've actually worked in the service industry before, and there is a way to let a customer know that a certain dish might not be as palatable that doesn't include a rude and condescending tone.  Little did she know that I had eaten the same exact dish a month prior and enjoyed it thoroughly.  In a town that has a lot of restaurants, I hope this is a lesson to treat customers like you prefer they come back again, and appreciate their business while they are there.",

Parking was a problem so use valet.  We were told it would be a 45 minute wait so we wandered into the bar area to find a seat.  We finagled two stools outside and enjoyed the spinach, crab, and artichoke dip.  Yummy!!!!  Our waiter recommended the orange vanilla beer and my husband had a Heffeweisen (spelling?).  Both were good.  Mine was very mellow and smooth. Good for people who don't really like beer.  Like me.  We ordered the smaller sizes and got two regular size pub glasses. (I think they were 18-24 ounces - not sure what the larger size would have looked like!)  By the time we finished our app the hostess popped over to tell us our table was ready.  (What 45 minute wait?  Secretly I think she only said that to discourage the group of 6 punk college kids that walked in ahead of us.)   As for the service, I don't know what everyone else is talking about but our waiter was great!  As soon as we sat down he asked if we wanted waters - which I did - and brought them immediately.  They use a thin cucumber instead of lemons which I thought was awesome...but I'd already drank half a beer with little to eat so everything is awesome at that point. :)   My husband ordered the barbecue burger which his boss had recommended.  I got the veggie burger after asking what the OHSO sauce was. It is Bloody Mary mayo.  Yes, you read that right.  Bloody. Mary. Mayo. I had to order it. I got fries on the side because I cannot resist potatoes in any form.    The food came out after a decent interval and my husband and I didn't speak for 10 minutes because we were busy stuffing our pie holes. (Bloody Mary mayo tastes like manna from heaven by the way.)  Between the beer and the appetizer I couldn't finish my food but I wasn't going to let all that flavor go to waste so I got to go box.  (30 seconds in the micro and it is just as tasty for a snack.)  The bill came to about $47 before tip which is to be expected after drinks and an appetizer.  Not too bad considering the damage we've done at other celebration dinners. ;)   I didn't give 5 stars because the parking could be better.  But we will DEFINITELY be back!  (There are like 20+ beers to try after all.)  P.S. we were told that the patio is dog friendly and they have a weekly contest. If you take a picture of your dog with one of their glasses or a growler you are entered to win a $25 gift card.  A winner is drawn every week.",

I am definitely impressed with the selection of beers, especially because I am a big craft brew person.  They also sell and refill growlers which is nice.  The staff was very friendly and I like that they have a dog-friendly patio (always a plus).  The food was a disappointment though.  I had the brisket sandwich with tomato soup and my girlfriend had the prosciutto flat-bread pizza.  Now, I have had some good brisket in my day so I was excited for a good sandwich.  I was surprised to see that it was pulled/shredded and drowned in sauce.  The sauce wasn't bad but I could not taste the meat itself.  Not sure if they were trying to cover something up or what but less is more when it comes to sauce.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  The tomato soup was okay, but tasted a little thin like something was missing.    The pizza had good points and bad points.  The flavor profile was pretty decent, but I am not sure I would call the meat on the pizza prosciutto.  If it was, it is not anything like I have tasted before (my girlfriend and I are big fans of good prosciutto).  This was but very thick and tasted like a better version of Canadian bacon.  Overall, not bad but not amazing either.  Our waiter was great and made some good suggestions for beer based on what I was looking for.  So now for the big question...will we be back?  Yes, but only to grab drinks before heading elsewhere or if we have our dogs and want to chill for a couple brews.  Other than that, I don't know if I will order anything to eat unless I know that they have improved the menu.",

No, I don't want to valet my car but thanks anyway.  $10 for a beer & a meal?  That is something I'm willing to invest in.  Given the parking situation, we figured the place would have major wait times... not the case.  We were seated immediately.  The inside looks like a hipster warehouse.  Is that a thing?  It is now.  Atmosphere is laid back.  Really nice beer selection.  There is something for everyone... and brunch was fantastic.  I had the churrasco steak & egg.  I don't know if it was my hungover state of mind but the proportion was perfect & the flavor was spot on.  After brunch, we walked out to the patio.  What a cute little spot.

A great place to ride your bike as well and extremely dog friendly.",

First and foremost, the quality of their beers are well below average (I'm Certified with BJCP). The place itself was super crowded - too crowded - with minimal parking and then a 40 minute wait on a Tuesday. We went to the back bar which was again crowded, with people and more dogs than I've ever seen in a public place other than at a dog park. Our drinks took forever to come and after one tasting flight of the entire list of amateurish beers my girlfriend and I left. No need to ever return.",

As a craft beer fan (I try not to say \"snob\"...), I'm overwhelmed with a place with this good a selection of beers that I've never tried before or are worth trying again. In addition to the ones they brew themselves (which are quite good), they also have a terrific selection of locals and from elsewhere, on draft. I get sample sizes when  I have the time, a pint when I don't. Happy hour is $6 for a pitcher (roughly 2.5 pints) for local Arizona brews. I've been here for happy hours, dinners, and late drinks with friends and have had a quality experience every time. To their credit, for a craft beer place they have a decent selection of mixed drinks and some wines. For food, I've been pleased with chicken sandwiches (very tender), the Sunday all-you-can-eat bbq, and appetizers. The food is decent enough given that the focus is on the beer (in my opinion). Servers have been quite knowledgeable about the beers. Atmosphere is kick-back casual, with a bright interior with various types of places to sit - booths, bar, tables, patio. Patio is dog-friendly. Parking can be tight but I've parked across the (rather busy) street (i.e., across Indian School), and it's not that big a deal.  So far the only matches for beer selection are World of Beer (Tempe and Gilbert); Angel's Trumpet (which has no happy hour and the food is so-so at best); and 1702 (Tucson).",

It was the perfect order for a chilly, rainy day. The 48th Street Fizz (orange vodka, pineapple, lemon, st. germaine, and beer) was sweet, but tasty (love cocktails with carbonation).

I always order either kale and pear salad or the veggie burger (because as mentioned there are really no other veg options), last night I had the kale and pear. It was 98% wilted arugula and maybe 2 pieces of kale. The service was also quite poor. They're always busy so the service is never great. I will think twice before going back there for a while.

Food quality and preparation has especially been better. The best deal is the weekend brunch. Breakfast items are very tasty and they throw in a 10oz beer to the $10 deal.  Open air dining is a plus.",

The parking lot was packed and just as I was about to get irritated I noticed there is complimentary valet service. Que  fancy!   The inside is super casual and clean and the staff was awesome! We didn't get to sit outside in the crazy cool and dog friendly patio. I saw a dog sitting on the a table outside!   I ordered from the $10 brunch menu. Food plus 10oz beer or mimosa. I had the breakfast wrap, the wife had the breakfast flat bread. I recommend both. My girls had chicken tenders which were actual chicken with a tasty fried covering. They loved their food too.   If you have kids, a dog, and hankering for good food you owe it to yourself to come here.",

    "text": "We've been here several times before for both late night drinks and for dinner with our dog.  We've always had an \"okay\" experience overall with decent food and service, fun atmosphere.  This time was so bad that we walked out before being seated.    The valet was rude and the hosts were even worse.  We walked in through the front (something we've done with the dog before) and while a friendly male host greeted us a short blonde girl ran over and told us to take the dog to the back patio because she wasn't allowed there.  We hurried out.    The host at the back patio didn't say a word to us so it took me a minute to figure out that he was the host.  He took my name and told us it'd be a 35-40 minute wait, but that we could also check in for the front patio to see if anything opened up there sooner.  I told him we had just been turned away from there, to which he responded, \"THE FRONT PATIO!\" as though I was either an idiot or hard of hearing.  So, back to the front I went while my father and his dog waited outside so as not to be scolded again for bringing her into the host stand.    The blonde girl was at the host stand, so I approached her and politely asked if we could put our name in for seating at the front patio as well.  With an appalling attitude she stated, \"You're already on the list for the back? Well, we have NO seating here, either.  There's NOTHING up here.\"  I told her that I understood, but that the other host suggested our names be put on this list as well since it's such a long wait.  \"Uh, okay, I guess I can put you're name in and you can just see which one opens up first!\" (Not a bad thing to say, but the way she said it was awful!) Frustrated by her attitude, I responded, \"Well yeah, that makes sense, right? That's what the other host told us to do, too.\"  She watched with a look of disgust as I took one of the complimentary dog treats for our dog to snack on while we waited (something we're usually encouraged to do!).    Having been in the customer service industry for about 15 years, poor service is a hot button for me.  No matter how busy, employees (especially those who are the first faces the customers encounter) need to maintain their composure and be friendly and empathetic.  We decided to leave and go to one of the many other locations nearby where the employees take pride in their work and know how to treat others with kindness.",

    "text": "OHSO is one of my favorite places in Phoenix and it has become a well known establishment among breweries and bars in the city.  I have been here more times than I can count but each visit was memorable.  There are 2 locations now but I still prefer the original one in Arcadia.  The atmosphere is wonderful!  OHSO is super dog friendly so there are always a ton of pups hanging out on the back patio.  The back patio is amazing but it is always packed on the weekends so I usually end up on the front patio which is a little quieter.    OHSO is brewery so obviously the beer selection is out of this world!  The best part is that they have an ever changing selection of their own beers.  I'm a big beer fan and I love trying new beers.  If you can't decide what beer to have, you can try as many as you would like for $1 each.  It's like your own personal beer tasting which is great fun!    The food at OHSO is great but not fantastic.  Some of my favorites are the crab dip, hummus, flat breads and the veggie burger is one of my favorites.  Brunch is a great deal at OHSO.  For $10, you get a full brunch entree and a large beer or mimosa.  Such a great deal with delicious food and local beer!   If you are really into craft beer-  check out OHSO for their brew your own beer.  Every Saturday morning they hold a brewing tutorial and you can make your own beer that will be tapped at OHSO a few weeks later.  This is how OHSO keeps their revolving taps of interesting beers.  Check it out if you haven't been or just go more if you have and hopefully I'll see you there!",

We all tried different drinks which were delicious! Our server was very nice and attentive. The accommodations for dogs was over the top so it wasn't a surprise that there was a dog or two at every other table! There was a dog bowl fill up area, dog snacks, and even a dog washing station outside. Next time I'm in town for a visit I will definitely return to O.H.S.O. for more drinks on the patio!!",

Good enough for group of 4.For main course I took the blackened salmon. Usually I try to stay away from seafood but this time the fish was pan fried and was fresh. Loved it.

The food selection, service, and their dedication to the community are outstanding. The first time I went I tried several of their beers/ciders and the waitress was so friendly, knowledgeable, and patient regarding our selection. They have an awesome selection of local beers--the only sad thing is it changes often, so if you really like a beer/cider you better get two or three because you might not see it again. It is great that they have $1 tasters, so you can try as many as your heart desires. For our entree my friend and I shared their Kalua Pork--it was so tender, juicy, and sweet--I would have licked the plate if I could. For dessert we had their amazing caramel apple pie.  This past time I had their Spicy Pulled Pork and French fries out on their patio--the pork was very juicy and sweet--unfortunately it was a little too juicy as the bread became very soggy and it was hard to eat, but it was still wonderful. Like I said I plan on coming back here again particularly on a Sunday for their $10 beer and brunch.  OHSO is definitely a wonderful and fun find.",

The first is the homemade dog treats that are given out for free for your pupper to enjoy.  The second thing to note are the mimosas that come in a huge glass. One comes free per brunch menu ordered. Even just one of these will make you a little tipsy and are a great value add to your brunch!  I can't give OHSO a full five star review because even with the above perks I do not find the brunch menu items to be overly amazing. I've had the fruity pebble French toast (which is overloaded with way too much lemon cream cheese filling), the brunch bowl (which is okay but nothing special, and the brunch burrito (which again is just a standard brunch burrito). The food does not particularly stand out as amazing, but the atmosphere, patio, dog treats, and massive mimosas make OHSO a great brunch destination.",

I really enjoyed the atmosphere it's very homey and cozy and not too fancy.   The food and drinks came quickly and our server was awesome. My friend and I each ordered some ohso brews. Mine, the white elephant was super hoppy so I didn't like it and it never said that it would be in the description. My friend got the groovy and it was watery tasting, yuck!   To eat, I had the brisket which was great! The crunchy onions and sauce just make it. My friend who also ordered the brisket, had her bun come out burnt. It's not that hard to toast a bun dudes...

    "text": "We came with a group of 9 for Sunday brunch and it was great! My favorite part was that they include a beer in their brunch prices!  I ordered the monte cristo which was spectacular. Generous amount of melted Swiss is on top of a pile of ham in between tasty French toast. They have a jam smear on the plate which tasted great with the sandwich (it may have been cranberry but I am not certain). The potatoes were meh, especially when compared to the sandwich.  My husband ordered their chicken and waffles which were also quite good. And that is coming from me, a person who is not crazy for fried chicken. It comes with a small bowl of fresh fruit.  One of my friends ordered the biscuits and gravy which was also surprisingly good. The biscuits were average. The gravy was great with a distinct southwestern flair. Lots of sausage and a nice chili flavor without being too hot.",

Went here to watch the game and they have great BIG TVs everywhere which is perfect to watch the game on. If it was rated on just ambiance and vibes alone I would give it 5 stars.  The food, drinks and service are below average. Especially for the price. I've been here multiple times and tried different things on the menu and every time, I am not feeling the food. The fries were cold, the burger didn't have any flavor. The best part about the meal was the pickle. The cocktail I had was like a very sweet juice, they seemed to have forgotten to put the alcohol in.  The waitress didn't tell us her name, she came by the table maybe 3 times in the 2 1/2 hours we were there, and gave us our bill without asking if we wanted anything else. Guess I wasn't allowed to try another drink on the menu... hmm. 2 stars because i really love the patio seating.",

The ridiculousness of phoenix restaurants forcing valet parking is annoying but fast becoming a standard  Other than the valet parking this place is wonderful. Beware of that AZ Burger though. If you can't handle spicy this will murder your taste buds. Lol But if you love heat then give it a try. The fries are standard but well seasoned. However, the star of this particular visit is the Artichoke Dip. It tastes similar to a spinach artichoke dip being a salty, cheesy concoction but this had an added bonus; sweet bacon relish. Omg, it's like sex in a little dish. If you're a lover of sweet food or mixing sweet and salty then please try this. You won't regret it. Another new favorite restaurant, I'll definitely be back!",

I've never had a shrimp taco with 1-2 shrimp in it. I exchanged the order for the grilled cheese and that was much better.

We wanted to try this place because it was recommend on the uber eats most popular list.   I have to be upfront about their biscuit and gravy... it was way too salty for my taste. I mean my hubby agreed with me and he normally eats his food with a bit more sodium than the average person. I think I like my food pretty salty as well.... so it shocked me that I could not bare to eat it... It was just unbearable to eat, at least for me. I felt like the gravy was coating my mouth with salt. It was not a pleasant experience for me. Thank god I had my salad to balance the saltiness of the gravy. I mean maybe it was just a bad batch. Maybe if I tried it again, it might not be as salty. However, I don't think I want to take the risk...   I would recommend their orange juice and pear salad.   As far as the atmosphere, it was casual and cool. It was super laid back and relaxed. It is a dog friendly restaurant with a dog friendly patio. They even had these complimentary and super cute dog treats. These treats are located at the front of the restaurant.     I don't think I would go back. I usually go back to a lot of restaurants as an usual customer. However, I don't see myself going back to this one anytime soon.",

They boast a variety of burgers, salads, flatbreads, and tacos. However, I'm a firm believer that their brunch menu is O.H.S.O's greatest strength.  I arrived during late morning with a group of groomsmen and the first thing we noticed (aside from the beer menu) was the brunch special. Choose one item from the brunch menu plus 10oz of any Arizona beer or 1 mimosa for only $10.99. They have a carnitas bowl, some flatbreads, and more typical items such as biscuits and gravy, but I went with a breakfast wrap! Who could say \"no\" to eggs, bacon, potatoes, guacamole, cheese, and salsa wrapped up in whole wheat? Came with a side of fruit too! It was pretty tasty.I prefer my food to have a bit of a kick so hot sauce was necessary.   As for the beer, I was hesitant to try the house beers and I've already tried the out-of-state ones so I went with local brews. Coconut Joe by Papago brewing was roasty and the coconut shined through. I also tried SanTan Brewing's Mr. Pineapple. They weren't freakin kidding. Tasted like I was drinking straight pineapple juice...  I doubt I'll be back in AZ. But if I do return, I'll keep O.H.S.O as an option. Check them out if you get the chance!",

There was a slight rain a brewin so they brought us an umbrella. Beers are always on point! Good was hit and miss. Tacos were good but deconstructed. Works for some. The Thai hummus tastes like peanut butter hummus. Not a fan. Had a bunch of other apps that were fine. I love the beer, the service and the whole place. Just gotta find my dishes.",

When the food was delivered to the table, the manager, Madison delivered the food personally and showed us a bit of \"love\" in our bar tab.   What this said to us was that we were valued customers and that the management was going to take a pro active approach to actually SHOWING us that.

Well that plan didn't work! Here are the reasons I love O.H.S.O 1.  Brunch: $10 for entree and a beer (Or mimosa) 2. Dog friendly patio: Plenty of water and dog hooks near the table, so the pooches can enjoy the day too.   3. Beer Selection:  I'm not a huge fan of beer, but I they have a great selection of draft beers and plenty of fruity girly options (which is what I'll drink).    As a vegetarian, I have been very pleased with their menu, trying everything from the breakfast grilled cheese (minus the meat), O.H.S.O Rita flat bread pizza to the Yucca chips and have been very satisfied.  This location is also pretty big, so it's great spot for large parties.",

The smell of pretzels, I am assuming, wafts thru the place and gives you the want for a large pretzel and beer. Free valet and friendly hops to take your ride away.  The pitchers of any Arizona brews are $6 ... Good price on the smaller pitcher for two and a good way to get a sampling without too much of a commitment. COULD have been alot colder. Nothing worse than beer that isn't icy.. in my opinion, at least. We started with apps of the hh smaller bites. I loved the pretzel and cheese dip/fondue. Could have given me a warm pitcher of that! We also had the OHSO Green Chile Dip ..not a thing wrong with it and the yucca chips are a treat. I'm a fan with the exception of the beer not icy thing and letting my water go dry. Picky picky!

Their brunch menu is not huge but they have a list of items all for $10 and it includes a beer or a mimosa so not a bad deal. I ordered the breakfast pizza which was a flatbread with eggs, cheese, chorizo and arugula. The portion was large - I ended up bringing half of it home with me. The mimosa was a good size too - it was served in a wine glass, not just a skimpy champagne flute.  The breakfast pizza had a really great flavor and was a nice lighter breakfast, even with the chorizo - I didn't feel weighed down afterwards. I tried a bite of my friend's French toast, too. It was good but really sweet. I was glad I had the pizza.  The wait staff was friendly but not super attentive. My friend had to ask three times to get a refill on her water.   But other than that, everything was great and I would definitely go back.",

I can see this as being good for several experiences:  meeting old friends, bringing your dog to lunch, first date, work lunch, etc.  With a mixed experience restaurant like this, your dreams will never be completely fulfilled.

Everything sounded delicious but my 2 friends and I all opted for the breakfast grilled cheese (fontina, prosciutto, green apple, w/ agave nectar and fruit on the side). I wish I wouldve ordered something else. The bread to cheese ratio was not good. Regardless, I would definitely come back to try something else.

The mimosas arrived (I was there with two others), and lacked any sort of flavor. The alcoholic content seemed rather low and the orange juice was decidedly bland (agreed by all).   Then the food arrived, the other two had order breakfast burritos which looked like burritos - always a good thing.   The waffles on the other hand, were distinctly cold and dry, as if they had been cooked first, or at the very least cooked an hour before we arrived. Upon further examination, they were more dry than expected, even pouring on the COLD syrup (which tasted like the cheap \"syrup\") couldn't take away the dryness.   The waiter could be bothered to ask how things were until after other two had finished their meals (he had walked by three times during the meal). I had left three quarters of the plate and yet there wasn't a single question as to why I didn't finish it.   Won't be returning for brunch or breakfast again, maybe for dinner as I hear the apple pie is good.",

I will be back several times in order to try the other dishes!! They pair a local beer or mimosa with brunch, I tried the lemon raspberry blonde which was a perfect compliment to my meal.",

    "text": "Wow - this place was absolutely PACKED on Friday night. After the essentially mandatory valet {bleh}, we waited about 30 minutes for a front patio table, as we had our dog in tow and couldn't sit inside. The back patio was an hour+ , but I wouldn't have wanted to be there anyway. We came to eat and the back patio was really full and more of a bar scene.   My husband ordered a beer and the server was really pushy to get me to order a drink. I finally snipped \"I'm driving\" and he stopped asking \"are you sureeeee you don't want a drink? a mimosa? a beer?\" every 4 minutes. My husband appreciated the beer selection and found a couple IPAs he liked. Prices were in line with normal beer prices in the area, about $5 a pint.  We ordered the Arizona burger and a regular cheeseburger. I was extremely underwhelmed. The fries weren't good, the pickle tasted weird and the beef was not properly seasoned. You can order \"pink\" or \"not pink\" {aka well done or mooing}, which is stupid. I would much rather have a {cheaper} burger from The Stand just down the road.   In an attempt to redeem our visit, I ordered a slice of the caramel apple pie {$7, brought in from Pie Snob}. It took way too long to come out and was again, underwhelming. So disappointing.   I wanted to like this place, as we love beer pubs and supporting local businesses, but it just didn't do it for me. I am unlikely to return.",

I figured the variety of beers would be the focal point of the brewery; boy, was I wrong.  This place has some of the best dishes in Scottsdale supported by a huge selection of beer.    Let me say this with more clarity: great food differentiates this place, not the huge variety of beers.  This is a great achievement considering many breweries focus on providing rare beers with mediocre food.    The \"Burger + Cheese\" is simply awesome.   A GREAT brunch dish is the \"Breakfast Burrito\" as well as the \"Breakfast Flatbread.\"",

Friends, food, beer, great service, easy to bike to and dogs are not just welcome, but treated as guests - this place has it all. We were looking for a nice way to spend the evening with friends who live within a few miles of here, so we packed up our bikes and drove over to meet them. We all boarded our bikes and had a nice ride along the canal as the sun was setting. We locked up the bikes and noticed the outdoor dog wash, and free to borrow bike locks and bike tools as you go into the patio - they have thought of everything. There are also self serve dog bowls so that your pooch can have plenty of water to stay hydrated, and free baked on site dog treats that you can help yourself to. We didn't bring the dogs with us last night, but I took a doggie bag home for them and they were appreciative.  Even thought it was close to 100 degrees last night, with the high power fans and the misters going, we were quite comfortable. The mister water dripped a bit on me and the table, but this is not fine dining with fancy clothes, this is bike in, drink a beer and enjoy some pub grub - so getting a bit damp was not a problem.  I am not a beer aficionado, but the guys with us are, and they were happy with the choices (hoppy IPA and something called a quad - both gave me bitter beer face which means my husband likes it). I had a nice cool Framboise, and a local banana and apple cider. The bread board appetizer with meat and cheese and nuts and other goodies was great to whet our appetites for our main courses. i had a BBQ burger, ordered pink, and it came pink - perfectly done. The bacon on it was generous and had a great flavor.  My husband had the green chile tacos and he was very happy - their tacos are make your own, which is more fun than having it all done up for you.  One of our friends is going gluten free, and they have a special menu for that crowd. She was happy with her options and her shrimp tacos. I didn't get our server's name, but she was very thin young woman with a funky hairband. She was great. Even thought the place was busy with all of the tables and the bar full, she checked in on us often without being intrusive or annoying.  The only negative is that this place is not closer to us.",

Eats are reasonably priced too.   I also enjoyed an excellent tequila cocktail: the Jensen. That refreshing drink with a jalepeno bite will be enjoyed again this summer.

You can see them actually making the beer and when we were there you could smell the mash from their latest beer. Here is a place that has good food and excellent beer, much of which they make as there is a selection of several OHSO specific brews.   Though parking is limited they have a free valet service that one just tips a few bucks on the way out, and then one can walk right in, a definite plus in the hotter months (well, half the year in Phoenix) here in the valley of the sun.   Once you are in, though it is busy there is lots of seating and the wait staff is personable. The wait person was nice enough to point out that the homebrewer who had done the beer I was having (a strong connection between OHSO and the local homebrew community) was sitting the next table over so I was able to have a quick chat about the makeup of the beer.  My parents and I both had the sausage brunch special and the sausage is from the German commissary next door. When you walk out, instead of going to the valet, walk next door and take a look at the sausage and cured meat selection, but remember to bring cash there as no credit is selected.   OHSO must be doing well because they seemed to have opened another location in North Scottsdale. All I know is that when I went here they seemed to be firing on all cylinders and its nice to be able to start up a quick conversation with a brewer in the open brewing area. I look forward to going here again!",

We better get another pitcher.    2pm - We are getting hungry again.  Yogurt and granola sound mighty healthy and refreshing.  Nope.  Well, sort of.  But still, let's also order fries.  And sweet potato fries.  2:45pm - Still hungry.  Did we really think yogurt and french fries would satisfy the 4 of us? It's almost time for the Backyard BBQ to start.  Bring more drinks, please.  3pm - BBQ Time!!!  Round #1 is gone in the blink of an eye. Any server within arms reach of our table is now at risk of being grabbed by saucy fingers.  We need more ribs!  And cornbread!    5pm - Our server is like part of the family as we say goodbye and head home smiling and full.  Great day!",

The beer selection here is great and especially since I'm a Californian I love trying new beers we usually don't get. I had the fish tacos which were tasty I just wish the jalapeno coleslaw was a little tangier/spicier/had more kick-- the fish was fried nicely though and it was the perfect amount of food.

I've never been blown away by their own brews, but they're certainly drinkable. I tend to go with whatever lighter ones of theirs are featured, or Four Peaks is obviously always a great fallback.  To be honest though, I mostly visit OHSO because they're super dog-friendly (even providing housemade treats for your pups!). The patio is always chock full of furry friends, and I'm a real sucker for dogs. This does mean that it can get a little rowdy, but what's a brewery without some noise anyways?  Their food is always good, but not mind blowing. I usually stick to the pretzels and other apps because in my opinion, their food is pretty dang pricy considering they're a fairly low key place. The brisket mac is good, but I'm rarely willing to pay $17 for mac and cheese. I will say though, at least it's a really solid serving size for the price. They also have excellent french fries.   It's likely that I'll keep coming to OHSO, but there are definitely better places nearby for cheaper food and better brews. Nowhere nearly as fun for both you and your pup though :)",

I always typically have the AZ Burger and fries. And the fries are some of the best around. Of course what I like best is the amazing beer. There is nothing like stopping by after work with a couple of friends for a few beers. It's a relaxing hang. The service is typically pretty darn good. And everyone is usually quite friendly. My only beef is at from time to time there can be a long wait in terms of service particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. But all in all this is one of the best brew pubs in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Let's start off by saying that we love(d) O.H.S.O. My wife and I frequented the North Scottsdale location (our home turf). We used to go to the one on Shea/Tatum pretty often as well. But, their prices have continued to creep up for brunches, and it just isn't the smokin' deal it used to be.  With that said, this location was a huge disappointment. IF we had started here, ther would be no way we would've gone to the other locations. The food was just OK. I got the Brat Hash with sausage gravy, and there was NO hash in it. Maybe a few bites, but it was overwhelmingly just vegetables. Despite that, there was a ton of oil in the bottom. I ate it because I was hungry, but we had to stop off somewhere else a little later.  I usually get the biscuits and gravy, and those are bomb. But, this isn't what was disappointing.   The service sucked baaaaad. The front hostess was nice, but the back patio (where you want to sit when you're here) hostess could'nt have been more useless. She walked us to our table, put the menus down and walked away. If it was me and my wife, whatever, but I had two kids with me. You would think the hostess would ask if we wanted a high chair or booster seat...nope.  Waiter came, we asked for one, he left with its drink order, came back with drinks, and we never saw him again. He switched out and didn't even let us know. New waitress was OK, but we had to hunt her down for the bill, and she charged us for the \"free beer\" you get with the brunch meal.   But, the rudest was the person who brought me my beer. He hit the table when putting it down, spilled some, and just walked away. I had to clean up his mess which was on the table and the chair.   Legit would never come back here again. This place doesn't hold a candle to the other locations, which we have been going to for the last 4 years.  Oh, and the view is supposed to be the best part, but that's a joke. Its blocked by all the umbrellas and shades.  Go to the one on Shea/Tatum. Much better service, much better patio, and less hipsters. The North Scottsdale location is also A+. I would skip this one.",

It's decor is a cross between a sports bar filled with plenty of TV's at all angles, a gastropub, and brewery. We didn't eat although the food looked pretty good. Now although it's not a True brewery (sorry to burst your bubble, real breweries don't have food or TV's), it's quality of in house brewed craft beer was exceptional and carries real brewing prestige! I love the fact that a brewer reared his head to snag a beer before getting back to work. The tanks within this \"nano-brewery\" are readily visible and they brew during business hours which is pretty cool. I got a hazy hibiscus pale ale aptly and comedically named Limp Biscus, as well as the bourbon barrel aged oatmeal stout. Both were awesome, with the latter being a 12 oz meal within itself. The staff was friendly and attentive. They have a good 25 taps and they have guest beers from other breweries in the surrounding area and beyond. It's definitely a community establishment and a place I would return to!",

Service was pretty good.  Not overly friendly but certainly efficient.  Had three flights and really enjoyed the variety of beers to choose from.  That was by far the best part of the experience.  Ate the Sunday BBQ and wasn't impressed.  $18 per person for all you can eat.  The plate they bring you looks pretty good.  I am not a huge fan of chicken or pork but love beef.  Neither the chicken leg or the ribs were crispy.  They tasted almost like they had been cooked in a crock pot.  I asked for a side of BBQ sauce to be able to eat them.  The brisket was good but not something I would crave or want again.  The red potato salad was okay.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I'm not a coleslaw person.  The cornbread was also fantastic and moist.  Couldn't eat enough coleslaw and cornbread to justify the $18 cost so I wouldn't do that again.  Would like to try the infused vodkas they distill if we do OHSO again.",

I have been to this location 4 times in the past year since moving to AZ and I have had nothing but AWFUL service. It's taken me a minimum of 10 min and maximum of 20 min before a server acknowledged our table and took our drink order. Then it takes another 10-15 min for us to get our beers. At that point we've been at the restaurant for 30 min and have one gotten 1 beer and haven't even put in our food order. Of course we leave with out ordering food because if it takes 30 min to be noticed and get 1 drink then how long will it take for them to get our food?!   I understand the food industry. I know when it's slammed the bartender can get behind on drinks. Or maybe the hostess has poor communication skills and failed to tell the server they sat someone in their section so we get over looked. I get it, sh*% happens. That's why I've gone back a handful of times in hope of change but haven't seen it!  It's still the same disappointing service.   It bums me out because I feel like this would be  place I would go to all the time since it's only a 5min drive from my house and I love getting drinks anywhere I can take my dog. But I don't appreciate being over looked all the time, what am I, invisible?",

The burger was smashed down, the spinach was soggy, and I had two drips of buffalo sauce. I'm not sure what the knife that came with it was for, no one needs it for that mc chicken sandwich. I told my server Trevor my sandwich was missing some toppings. Trevor told me they brought me the wrong sandwich. So he took it back. The cooks put more spinach on it and brought it back. I looked at this \"new sandwich\" with disappointment and sadness and refused to eat it. I'm more upset that everyone else's food looked amazing and mine just looked like ass. Thanks for making the experience better Trevor.  At least my friends and I will remember the hilarity of my sorry sandwich.",

Came around 9pm on a Friday and there was no wait. We got to choose our table and selected one on the patio since it is still cool enough at night to enjoy outdoor dining.  My sister and I opted to split the Kale and Pear Salad and the Salmon BLT with a side of Sweet Potato Fries. Yum yum yum! Both dishes were delicious! We added steak to the salad because my friend raved about the OHSO's Steak Fries and I assumed it was the same steak. It was everything she built it up to be and completely melted in our mouths. As well all know, salad dressing is what makes or breaks a salad - and this dressing was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. It was also the perfect amount of dressing - not too drenched and not skimpy. The BLT's salmon was cooked to perfection - definitely done but not at all dry. I really liked the sandwich bread. And the bacon - nuff said - how can you ever go wrong with bacon? I would totally order both items again.  My only complaint is the mister system above our table kept dripping on me and by the end of our dining experience there was a puddle of water on our bench. Other than that, our service, food, and overall experience was awesome.",

But what makes it worse is the parking situation where they force you to valet your car for a parking spot 20-30 feet from the door. Now I've been around the world but that is cheap/strange/and just plain annoying. Maybe they think they are helping drunk people by pulling their cars out of a parking space? I don't know but it really makes an honest review difficult when they force this upon people. As for the food goes, my wife loved their polenta.  I thought the beer was solid and the food ok.  Our friend was on a weird diet so she didn't care.  Overall the place is ok...or A-ok.",

The patios are super cool and the beer is fantastic at this little bike-dog themed Bar. Another Phoenix fav.   They're great at keeping their large busy times in check, and oddly, I experienced my first ever valet (free) car parking experience because... well they won't let you do it any other way. I was hesitant to let my pride and joy (my car) be driven by strangers. But it was all well in the end and even my dog Hank ended up with an OHSO bone treat made from spent grains",

O.H.S.O was the first thing that popped on my yelp search.  I parked right in front of the restaurant in the restaurant parking lot.  I walked in and seated myself at the bar.  I ordered some beer and ordered an Arizona burger.  The bar tender wasn't too friendly... she seemed to be a bit of a stuck up. It looked like everyone seated at the bar were regulars and maybe that's why I didn't feel so welcomed but, that really shouldn't be the kind of service that I should be getting regardless.  What saved it was the burger.  The Arizona Burger was OH SO GOOD!  If I lived in Phoenix, I'd probably come back for the burger even though the service sucks.  Who knows maybe the other servers are nicer!",

Dogs are allowed to roam around in the back outdoor bar with water on tap for them, mist machines for hot days, fans to keep you cool everywhere, several outdoor large screen tvs for game days and great ice cold beers.  Maybe 40 to choose from on tap.  I can't comment on food, because we just drank.  My advice would be to anyone in the area, stop for the beer!  The food looked killer.  The staff was friendly, smiling, and having a great time.  Hope this helps  everyone out.",

Plus:  - They offer free valet parking, which was both fast and convenient - The patio in back is dog friendly and has it's own bar (this is a large area) - They offer free, homemade dog treats for your furry friends on the patio - They have large booths and high top tables on the patio, with umbrellas for shade (and rain, which is why we ended up using it) - The entire patio is lined with the coolest fans (no pun intended) - they were bicycles and the wheels were fans. Really awesome!  Minus:  - The service was SLOW. It probably took at least 15 minutes before anyone approached our table - The inside is small (ish). There was at least a 45 minute wait because a large party had moved in from outside and took over the bar area  - They were out of 90% of the beers I wanted to order.  I understand, it happens.  But after 4 different times of ordering and being told (after our server went to actually retrieve my order) that they were out, it was frustrating  Overall, it's a cool spot and I would go back.  I would just hope that they find a way to be more on top of their brewing, because it's really disappointing to go somewhere new and not be able to try the beers that are supposedly available (they hadn't just run out either).  Update the menus or make sure your servers know what's available.  It was such a process to order anything because he would go off to put in the order, then come back 10-15 minutes later to say it was out.  This happened 4 times.  We didn't eat, but the menu looked good. I would love to go back for their \"backyard BBQ\" on Sundays. And the next time I am in town, I am definitely bringing my dog - there should be more places like this in Vegas!  Maybe I just caught them on a bad night.",

Green chili pork skillet is mostly rice, with a little pork thrown in. They pile the rice on it so I had a hard time picking it out. I would call this a rice bowl with pork. Pork is certainly not the main ingredient. Carne asada tacos were good, but not really worth $15.50 in my opinion. Food is not terrible but just ok. Don't go for the food.

I said it's not a big deal that they had to photo copy my ID and card and they still kept talking loud about it to the point people were watching. Then the guy who wasn't being loud came back and said it swiped and I left my 20% tip and left. If/when I go back I'll be bring fucking cash...who knows it might still be suspect as fake. Everything was fantastic till it came time to pay, and for the experience alone.......",

    "text": "After an excellent time here Sunday, it's high time I get my review of OHSO out to the people! I've been coming here since day one, and the transformation in the few short months has been outstanding.   The beers have always been excellent. Excellent selection from our local breweries here in AZ and from around the country. The food started slow....really slow. The first few times I ate here I had decided that it would just be a beer spot for me. But not lately. They have really stepped up their game and the beer brunch is incredible. $10 for a great plate of food (I prefer the steak and eggs) with a 10oz local beer on the side. Awesome. Where else can 4 people have breakfast and beers and get out of there for under $60???? NOWHERE that's where.   This weekend I was suprised by yet another improvement: The back patio. What an AMAZING SPACE! They have turned this previously un-used area into an incredible drinking environment. AND they feature a local brewery out on the patio that will rotate regularly. Owner Jon Lane is seriously stepping up the involvement of the craft brewing industry and has his location poised to become the mecca of local beer. I sat in the sun, drank my Sonoran IPA, and revelled at how great a space and drinking locale OHSO has become. Just fantastic.  Sometime soon OHSO will begin brewing their own beer and that's when this place will start to deserve a 6th star. Can't wait! OHSO is my favorite for beer and I will continue to come back here time after time.",

    "text": "My experience while at O.H.S.O. was mediocre from the time I walked in the door until the time I left.  A bit pricey for the service and food, I don't know if I would go back.  Here's my story if anyone wants to hear it....  The nicest people in (outside) the joint were the valet boys.  Funny and charismatic, those poor boys standing in 110 degree heat were the liveliest employees we saw.  We stepped through the doors to the front desk, which I assumed was the hostess, and we stood.  The hostess and I awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds.  Seriously at least 10 seconds went by.  Long enough for me to think \"maybe I went to the wrong place, maybe she has forgotten that SHE works here, so I asked, \"are you the hostess?\"  She uncomfortably said yes, as if she was confused why I asked, and asked how many were in my party.  While being seated I asked my fellow diner, \"was I being sensitive or was that the most awkward hostess experience ever?\"  It was agreed that she must have had a mini-stroke just as we walked in.  We were seated and asked about what OHSO beers were on tap.  Apparently there weren't any.  A nano-brewery has no beers.  Maybe the hostess drank it all, and that is what was wrong with her?  Apparently they had a beer tasting a few days before and had been out of beer ever since.  So we tried a few others, cant remember the names, but both were dark beers and delicious.  Oh well, I have had OHSO beers before at a tasting and didn't love them.   The waitress was friendly enough, but had just started her shift and was a little slow, but the other waitresses seemed to pick up her slack and we never wanted for anything but our food.    We ordered our food.  Ceviche, cheese pizza, and pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Nearly 45 minutes later we got it.  The ceviche was a small bowl of  deliciously fresh ceviche topped with a lot of avocado.  I have never had ceviche that hasn't been made in a Mexican restaurant or home, so I am partial to a big bowl of real Mexican ceviche and for $12 I felt there could have been more.  Especially since the chips they served with it were VERY stale and after sending them back we were brought tortilla chips so greasy that the grease made them soggy by the end of the meal.  The cheese pizza was for my 10 year old and she loved it- 1st time she has ever finished an adult meal at a restaurant.  The pastrami was good too, but also so greasy that it made the bun wet.  The sweet potato fries were the best part of the meal, which meant that I had to share them with the rest of the table.  I may have yelled at everyone to stop eating my food.  In all, our bill came out to nearly $60 plus tip for 3 of us, which included 2 beers.  Side note: We went to the bathroom after our meal, (I know TMI,) and there was a bunch of flies in there. Wouldn't be as big of a deal IF there were windows, but there weren't.  It smelled and looked like an outdoor bathroom full of filth and dirtiness.  And seriously, how did a dozen flies end up inside an indoor bathroom with no windows?   This is a dog friendly place that apparently has a back entrance and a patio for dog lovers.  Not my cup of tea, even though I have 4 dogs, so I like that they have a separate entrance.",

If you're in the back and you order beer, it seems faster to get the beer that's available on tap out back rather than the  beer up front. For me, the difference was 20 minutes. It took forever to get my first beer out but that may have been because they were busy. Other than that, no major complaints.  If there is no space to park in the front, just park across the street.",

Don't name your place something catchy, only to have no meaning behind it.  We asked our server, and her answer was, \"We don't know...\" Make it up at this point, to avoid the buzzkill when the answer falls short.  How about, \"So-So\" instead?  Salads follow the motto, \"Quality over quantity.\" The few little grapes hidden in the bottom didn't justify a $12 salad with no taste and bland dressing.  I wanted to like, actually -- LOVE this place, and I was sad with the experience. The prices are high, and services is sub-par, and they might just get away with it for a year or so.  I am the biggest supporter of local biz you will ever know, so it bums me out to write this.  Maybe with some tweaks, OHSO can turn it around.",

With the exception of the arepas, the menu is fairly standard pub fare. I don't recommend the arepas, though, or at least the tuna one. It just wasn't clicking.  O.H.S.O.'s best aspect is ambiance. With warm colors and wood accents, it feels like a nice, friendly pub you can bring your kids to. Considering the other options for decent beer selections around central Phoenix, O.H.S.O. isn't perfect, but it might be the best short of a drive to Papago.  Also, Arizona's beer culture is picking up, but it is just not there yet. I appreciate O.H.S.O.'s dedication to local brewers, but they'd be better off reaching into California/Oregon/Colorado than hosting a bunch of mediocre Fretzky's taps. Or at least some of Four Peaks better stuff...",

But what got me to come back here for two more times even though I don't live close to here was their awesome patio and the way they always change their beer menu. They print the beer menu every day and on my last visit I finally had my two dogs with us so they could also enjoy the patio. They also love the free dog treats. Also, they had a lot more house made beers in the menu this time and a good late nite muchie menu for us. We had the pepperoni flag bread. Good enough to share and cheap for only $5. Anyways, I believe that this place is a strong 4 star and I'm sure I'll be back soon!",

The Sunday brunch is one of the best deals around - $10 for a meal and either a beer or a mimosa.  The meals are all quite good and the mimosas are strong.  Above average bloodys as well, two great porches (front and back) that are a little too comfortable.  Also dog friendly so if you have a social pooch be sure to take him/her with.  And, of course, the beer selection is top notch, though twice now I've settled on a favorite only to find them replace it in their cycle.  The price of keeping things fresh.  :)",

Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.  I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.

    "text": "Okay, it has taken me a long time to write this review because I am feeling very guilty.    When I walked out of O.H.S.O. a bald guy by the door on a computer asked us how our meal was, truly showing how much he cared about the bar.  I lied.  I told him it was great and I walked out.  I feel SO GUILTY. I wish I had said something to him.   So, here it is...  A letter to the management:  We came to O.H.S.O. based on friend's recommendations and reviews I kept seeing in Phoenix magazine. I really wanted to LOVE this place. We even came for our 4th anniversary!!!!  I, unfortunately, do not think we will be back.  We ordered the Prosciutto flatbread and the Brisket Burger along with 2 beers, and 3 tester beers throughout the meal (Sonoran white chocolate, luge be chocolate milk, ohso orange nitro, double jack, hop box imperial ipa).  Sonoran and Nitro were good, the Chocolate milk was meh and the Jack and Imperial were yummy (says the boyfriend).  The Prosciutto flatbread sounded amazing.  Prosciutto, broccolini, garlic pomodoro, you can't go wrong!!! It did.  The flatbread came out as my meal and it looked like a meal for a lumberjack.  It was packed with a chunky meat and was impossible to look hot eating this thing, during our anniversary dinner.  Of course I expected shaved prosciutto, like probably 99% of the customers expect.  I saw this thick cut sliced prosciutto that looked like and tasted like canadian bacon.  I get that O.H.S.O. wanted to go different; this was different, but not better.  It would be great if it was regular thinly sliced prosciutto, so you could savor ALL the flavors at once instead of feeling like your eating meat and bread.  This was clearly a dish that was made by men in a kitchen. Extra meat does not always mean better, and making it so hefty negates a huge number of women from wanting to order it.  If the food is too cumbersome, I don't want to eat it.  Especially on my anniversary.  Next the Brisket burger... ::sigh:: It was just a disappointment.  We knew it was stupid to order brisket after we had the best brisket ever in New Orleans for the holidays.  But my boyfriend was craving it so he ordered it.  Again, someone that owns the place, or someone in the kitchen decided that regular brisket was not good enough.  So pulled brisket was apparently the way to go.  No dude. Brisket means sliced with that pink smoke ring.  Pulled brisket shows people that the kitchen doesn't know that or does not have the smoke ring and wants to rip the meat apart so you don't see it.  Plus, it was bathing, NAY soaking in the tub of sauce which just intensifies the idea that there is no confidence in the meat or the smoking of the meat, so why not mask it in sauce.  That was almost like when your mom would make a meal as a kid, and she'd mess up and it would be bad, so she'd just whip out the ketchup and squirt it on.  I had previously repressed that memory of my mother, until O.H.S.O.  Once again, another man meal.  Way too heavy, and not much care taken to prep.    I feel bad, because someone put amazing flavors together in their head.  But not being confident in the flavors allowed someone to try to tweak something in each plate that was supposed to be awesome and just makes the whole meal fail.  Go back to basics and then test stuff one at a time.  I would NEVER go back for the food, ever, even though the menu looks amazing.  Bring a trained chef or a woman in to show you what's up, and show you that each food item is WAYYY too heavy. I even watched a salad go by that would dwarf Elaine's \"Big Salad\", it was a beast.  It's not even like we're pansy eaters too. We're both 6 foot+ and can put away footlong subs in one sitting. But when going to O.H.S.O. I don't want to feel like I just put away a footlong sub. Plus, food that heavy decreases beer sales because people get too full too quickly.   I really am rooting for this place and I want it to succeed.  But some menu revamping needs to happen. 52% of the population is women and the food is way too heavy for us.    Great look, great interior, great decor on the walls, I love seeing the tanks and people making beer to the side.  If I opened my own bar I would have done the SAME THING, same look, same feel. Except the menu.  I will come back if the menu is revamped.  Otherwise, we'll save the trek from Laveen.",

I tried a couple beer samples and settled on a local beer on tap.  Tasty. We ordered the brisket mac and cheese, which was awesome. Creamy, cheesy, and the only suggestion I have is a hint more drizzle of bbq sauce. The tang is an amazing contrast to the creamy flavor. Delicious! Also ordered the AZ burger, which I really liked with the creamy Poblano taste, but my husband often forgets that he actually doesn't like peppers shoo it wasn't his favorite. I think this also could benefit from some additional flavor from the beef itself as the pepper is a little overwhelming to it. Still fantastic though.  I will happily come back any time. Service was great. I love it when you go to a place where the staff actually seem to enjoy their job and each other. It resonates throughout an establishment and creates an allover better experience.",

If you are not a beer drinker, they offer a great list of mixed cocktails. The Arcadia, The Mule, The Sangria....well everything on their cocktail menu is delicious!  They offer a great Grill Cheese with Fontina Cheeses and apple wood smoked bacon.  For Brunch, I have tried the Breakfast Flabread and Breakfast Grilled Cheese.  Both amazingly good!

We wanted to complain to the manager, but it wasn't worth it. We couldn't even use the darn chair because our daughter couldn't even see at the table. She ended up squirming around in our laps so she could eat. It's just not that kid friendly, unless you get a normal table. It was fun to try, but we probably won't go back.",

I mean what's not to like about nano-brewery beer right?  1st off - great service... we had a party of 19... no \"OMG face from the manager / hostess\" - nothing but... \"No prob... we got this!\" - Waitstaff was off the charts friendly & efficient... definitely added to the experience.  Menu is small plates, big plates, flatbreads, salads & something you almost never see on menus... Arepas...   After a couple of 6% alcohol content \"Kilt-lifters\"... it was time to chow down.   Feeding a herd of 19 buzzed semi-mature but hungry men is no easy task.  I had the beet salad & the shrimp taco small plate... Small plate? It was 5 tortillas and a whole lot of shrimp cooked to perfection...  awesome!  The others dined on ribs, pulled pork & pastrami... amongst other things... not one negative among the chosen chow...  Interesting mix of locals and hipsters...  I guess the bird-shit covered maserati belonged to one of the local posers? Perhaps... but for the most part, a fun, easy going crowd who were there for the food... and the mostly, the beer...  A definitely must try in the AZ",

The dish came with about 6 or 7 small tortillas, some slaw and a great sauce.  I thought it was fun to assemble my own fish tacos, something I wasn't expecting.   I ordered the Monkey Knife Fight beer (can't pass up a beer with that name) and it was also really good.   I was loud there but I assume it was just because of the football fans and if you live in the area (Arcadia, Scottsdale) you can actually ride your bike on the canal and get there really easy.   The best part by far was the take home doggie treat at the door.  I thought that was a really good touch.   Their menu was diverse enough to accomodate everyone and there are so many different beers, you could spend a few days drinking there and never try the same one.  They get new beers on tap often to keep things fresh as well.   I recommend this place for sure.",

They have a very large selection of rotating taps, including many other local Arizona brewery beers from Tempe, to Tucson to Sedona. They're happy hour apps. aren't amazing to be honest, but the price of pitcher beers is!

This location is right off of the canal, and a wonderful stop for anyone out riding a bike, walking a dog, or who loves a great patio. Behind the building, OHSO offers a back patio with a bike maintenance station, free dog treats for your furry friend, and a gorgeous view of Camelback Mountain. Their fun, laid-back vibe is perfect for an afternoon beer ($6 local pitchers at Happy Hour!) or a bike bar crawl with friends!  The service at OHSO has always been prompt and friendly in my experience, and the waiters are very kind about moving an umbrella over to your table if it's a particularly hot/sunny day. I've tried several of the entrees and apps at OHSO, and honestly, I've loved them all! (Special shout out to the Shrimp Ceviche and the Turkey Melt... so good!)   They have a program where you can come in and brew your own beer for $50, and then they give you $50 in gift certificates when you have a tapping party for your keg! How cool is that? Basically, it's no cost, except that you (and presumably all of your beer-drinking friends!) buy glasses of your beer at the end... of course, by then, you're spending the gift certificates they gave you! I hear that this books up months in advance, so it's the kind of thing you have to plan well ahead of time... but it sounds great!  Long story short, go to OHSO for the ambiance, the view and the great beers. Bring your dog along and enjoy a chill afternoon with friends!",

I love the AZ Burger, the selection of beer is good (IF they have what is listed - that seems to be a basic struggle each time I visit) and the patio seating is fun (when available). Their brewed beers have improved since they first opened (a plus).  I will certainly be back in a few months.

I highly recommend getting a pitcher of it and not sharing with anybody...because it's delicious...make them get their own pitcher! And it's only $6 on happy hour, you really can't beat that deal.   As for food, check out the flatbreads. The Pisa is amazing as well as the Grilled Chicken Flat  Prost!",

It is a great space with interesting seating and atmosphere.   From the moment we arrived, the staff was friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately, our friend was at a different location so didn't connect.   We were offered a flight to help decide which of their \"Yeasty Boys Collection\" lagers to choose. They turned out to be very interesting. Lagers made with four different yeasts giving them very different flavors.   Kyle, our server, could not have been more helpful or attentive. He was great! We got the American Lager, the humus appetizer, and the \"Burger & Cheese.\" Enjoyed them all. The beer paired well with all. The humus had good flavor and a little zing, and the burger and fries were just right.   All in all, it was a perfect evening. Our only regret is that we live on the other end of the country and it will be hard to come again!",

    "text": "There are some places that are hard to review because they are bad. There are others that are difficult to review because there's just not much to say that hasn't been said before or otherwise. And then there are the places that are hard to review because you like them so much and they deliver time and time again and mere words just won't serve as proper adulation for such revered establishments. OHSO, if you couldn't guess, falls into the third category.  My most recent experience at this restaurant solidified my love for this place. OHSO let's/teaches/enables you to brew your own beer and then serves it to eager/unsuspecting customers. For a mere $50 and plenty of time ahead, you and a few friends get a private brewing lesson/walkthrough and actually end up creating your own batch of drinkable beer. Our brewmaster instructor, Dave, was as good as we could've asked for. Knowledgeable and personable, he taught us so much in the few hours we spent brewing an IPA. If you have any interest in brewing our own beer or not, this is a great experience that everyone should try.  And that's only tip of the icerberg when it comes to this place. Here are a few other highlights:  - Dog-friend patio - Killer menu (breakfast flatbreads are a personal favorite) - Beer beer and more beeeeeeer  And as a staunch supporter of the local economy, OHSO is always encouraging patrons to drink as much AZ beer as possible. So if you haven't been here already, bump this place up to the top of your list of places to try next.",

    "text": "Sorry to be so harsh but bad experience start to finish.   We walk in on a Saturday night and it's pretty dead. They seat us (2 top) right next to the in and out of the kitchen. I look around and see plenty of open tables so I'm not sure why this was the logical place to seat us.   I sit down and practically slide under the table because the seat is not bolted to the wood frame. So the bench cushion which is vinyl would slip .... hard to explain but it was annoying. On the first slip I put my hand on the table to catch myself only to feel something squishy under it. When I lifted my hand off the top of the table I had the last guests rice on it. Gross!  We order drinks...the same way we always do. Loud and clear 2 iced teas NO lemon. No lemon please. She said ok no problem. She comes back a bit later with 2 good sized iced teas with a beautiful slice of lemon on each. Really? That is usually my first indication of bad service. It rarely happens but if it does I know it's going to be interesting at best.   I couldn't find anything to order (Not the menu it was me) so I ordered some sweet potato fries. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger. I asked if my fries could be brought out asap as I was starving (again not them me).   My fries were brought out and they were hot...which is nice. That is where nice ended as they had a burnt taste to them. Not so good.   My husbands burger came out and I will upload the picture. I am all for a little pink in the middle of the burger but I am not down with a light sear on the patty. I have never seen such an under cooked burger in my life. I did nibble the edge and what I got was very good but it was not safe to eat the whole thing. So we asked for our check and bolted.   The other annoying thing is the valet parking. It is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. The parking is plenty there and you literally hand a guy a ticket to grab your car 5 - 10 feet away. I am all for job creation but this is just annoying.   I will not be back, I'm sure they do not care lol but I would also like to say I would not recommend to anyone unless you are in the neighborhood and you are craving well thought out but poorly executed food.",

    "text": "O.H.S.O. is where all good beer drinkers will spend the afterlife. I feel like I've lived here recently and sadly have never written a review. The reason is because each time I've come here I've inevitably wound up trashed and hungover the next morning. As a result I've sadly neglected my review of O.H.S.O. so this is long overdue.  I first came to O.H,S.O. for a company function and they put together an awesome special menu for us complete with beer pairings. Each course was amazing from the Mahi-Mahi sliders to the meat to the dessert. The owner came and told us his story and it was really inspiring to see someone turn their back on corporate life and follow their dreams, which in this case is all about beer.  I actually have this fantasy about laying under one of the taps with my mouth open and just saying \"pull\". The hard part would be choosing which beer. There are SO many varieties that you can be confident that there is something for everyone. If you're not sure, or overwhelmed like I was, the staff there know their stuff and can point you in the right beer-drinking direction.  The entire place is cozy and inviting, from the bar area to the lively patio. No matter where you sit, you'll always be surrounded by friendly beer-lovers. No need to leave your four-legged friends at home because the patio is dog friendly, complete with the  \"Barking Bar\" to keep them hydrated.   O.H.S.O. is definitely on the \"Best of the Valley\" list and a great choice whether you're local or from out of town.",

The atmosphere of OHSO was very hip and industrial and it was quite cool to see the brewers in action right behind our table.  Gotta love the fresh scent of wort!  We started with the green chili bean dip which was very tasty, but it didn't come with nearly enough pita bread to finish all the dip.  The barbeque beef sandwich I ordered was so saucy that the sauce masked any flavor of the beef.  It was absolutely huge and the bun was huge as well so I ended up taking the top bun off altogether and eating it with a fork.  All in all, we decided the drive to this place was a little too long to really make us want to stop in again.  As my hubby would say, we wouldn't \"crave\" anything from OHSO.",

I come in again and get it and it's \"meh.\" I have been here quite a few times and a few of my favorites are the pastrami, the chorizo and potato flat bread, and skirt steak and fries. Really if I am being honest though, most of the time I am not going here for the food. I am going for the beer. 50 taps. Half from AZ half from elsewhere. Not only is it a good selection but they serve it in correct glassware and know how to pour beer. Huge pluses. Their signature cocktails are quite good as well. I really enjoyed the Arcadia (with bubbles) and lived the Mule, especially that it comes in a copper cup.   Atmosphere: Good to great. The back patio is awesome great place to bring your dog and enjoy a few pints on a fall evening. They have misters in the summer and heaters in the winter. The indoor portion is nice as well. The tables are super interesting, the walls are decorated with bicycle parts and a giant chalkboard with their draft selections.   Service: Decent. Nothing great nothing to write home about. A couple of times, gave a great huge tip because they were awesome. Never have felt like I shouldn't give on either. The biggest problem is parking. During the evening they have complimentary valet, but even then there have been a couple times I had to park in the neighborhood across the street and hoof it. No biggie though.",

First: if I could rate only on the location and outside patio would be a five but since had to eat and since the patio had a 45 min wait for two that didn't happen.... ordered an app and their bbq Sunday special. all was kinda bland and flavorless, apart from the cornbread which was delish. of the ribs, brisket and chicken the brisket was best; the other two were pretty lukewarm and in serious need of a sauce infusion. so in short don't come to Ohso for good eats come for the nice patio and varied beer selection. if I skipped the food part and had forty five minutes to kill I would probably have had a better result.",

Sat there fairly long time to order, had to ask for water twice....not sure if I would go back, not a fan of being treated that way.

Valet parking is a nice touch and made it really easy to get in and out. My salad was tasty and about what I expected from a brew pub.

Plus they are on happy hour from open until 6pm- only $6 for a pitcher!   OHSO has many options for seating from seats at the bar to high tops to couches. They have 2 outdoor patios- the one in the front facing Indian School which is always open and a back patio facing Camelback Mountain that is open on the weekends for brunch (served 9am-2pm). Both allow dogs so I brought mine one afternoon and the staff was great bringing him water & taking care of us!   I didn't think the spinach artichoke + crab dip was anything special- way too much spinach and not enough artichoke and crab.   Had their grilled cheese and it was amazing! The bacon was crisp and thick and a perfect compliment with the cheese & tomatoes. I've also had the Green Chili pulled pork sandwich that is incredibly delicious! Don't bother trying to pick it up with your hands- just use your fork.  The service has always been great here and the restaurant is always clean. If I lived closer I'd be there more often!",

I had cider...which really doesn't tell you much.  But I did try their sangria and I really wasn't impressed.    It was pretty awesome that the owner, John, came up and chatted with us for a good half hour about the restaurant.  It has only been open for 6 weeks and they are trying different things with the menu.  The micro brewery won't be up and running for another 6-9 months, but the beers that they had were from breweries local and from the western side of the country.  He also let my two friends try different types of beer to see what they would like.  I only heard amazing things about the White Chocolate beer that they had.  He also explained to me why I may had not like the sangria, which was also interesting.    I did not have anything to eat while I was there, but I had to say that the ribs that our neighbors at the next table were having smelled AMAZING!  (I am not a BBQ person by any means, so that to me was a big plus)   My friend and I both commented that we had to try this place since we drove by it so many times.  I can't wait to go back and try the food...and update the review! :)",

    "text": "We came in with a large group celebrating a graduation, and most of us had just arrived in town  from Seattle. The location was fun & trendy, but the drinks & service were terrible. My poor sister had just come off a 48hour nurse rotation, then traveled, and was feeling pretty exhausted when we approached the bar to order food - after being ignored by the waitress serving our group- the silly girl closed her eyes at the bar (obviously frowned upon in any alcohol serving establishment) while sitting waiting to get a bartenders attention... it only took a few seconds for her to be bombarded with waitresses (not serving us at any point in the evening) and kicked her out. She politely agreed to leave, but since we were with a large group and not from AZ, she asked if she could simply wait near he back exit while our group finished up. The waitresss (whose name i didn't catch-African American girl with a large Afro styled hair) was so rude to us I was in shock and couldn't believe her when she left the bar to walk across the parking lot; where we were sitting quietly on our phones trying to organize an Uber ride; and began screaming that she was calling the cops! I was in such shock I thought she was joking! Needless to say we will spend our time and money else where during our time in AZ. Super disappointing to be treated so terribly for no legitimate reason. Also found it funny that the bartender had time to greet, hit on, and exchange numbers with my sister before she was \"86'd\" for her \"belligerence\" ..... classic example of female on female judgement and cruelty.",

Very nice and plenty to share with all 4 of us.  Unfortunately the bar was very slow and there were only 5 tables occupied when we arrived and 2 guests at the bar.   It took more than 10 minutes to get our first round of drinks and even longer for a second glass of beer or wine!  The bartender also told us off \"nicely\" for switching a plain bar stool for one with a back!  Letting us know it just wasn't done and she would allow it this time!  Killed our mood!  During our meal we noticed she was absent and then reappeared enjoying her own supper.  At that point 15 min passed and our server was finally able to bring me my 2nd glass of wine!  It was time to go.  The server seemed genuinely apologetic, and was very pleasant but the experience was not!  Therefore 4 stars for the quality of the beer and food. 0 stars for the bartender and 3++ for our waiter.  4-3-0 =2.33 average!",

There is a wealth of choices available, many of which are not commonly seen or carried at most bars or restaurants. For the micro brew fans, you will love this place!  It gives you the ability to try some of the best selections out there from across the state and also some of the most popular out of state brewery's.  OHSO scores high marks on environment as well especially now that the new back patio has opened.  Great idea to do that especially with the canal behind it and the limited space up front.  If you get there during happy hour and wonder where all the people are, they are out back!  My only downside to OHSO so far has been the food.  I like the creative menu idea but nothing I have had has ever stood out in any way.  It is neither good or bad, just average.  I guess I tend to compare everything to 4Peaks and that is hard to compete with.  But overall, who cares.  Lets go drink some beer!",

The inside is pretty legit too, bar atmosphere, but they have this back room area that's got some couches for lounging...that part is kinda dark and relatively sketch but I could def see myself getting loud and tipsy back there.

Beer was good as always. Food, not so much. Crab won tons were very good, grilled cheese was soggy and had spaghettio sauce which they called tomato marmalade lol. Pretzel was ok, beer cheese was good. Calamari was a 1 out of 5 and the ahi was low grade at best. Since I haven't given them a review before you can consider the place a 3. I'll check in next time and hopefully it will be positive. Atmosphere is very good consistently and servers are polite.",

Parking is super limited and valet only on busy evenings, though parking is available on the street in the neighborhood directly across the street.

All of the food I've tried has been great, and the burger is one of the best I've had anywhere, and worth the price which is just a bit higher than average. This is definitely my favorite place within walking distance of home.   The (dog friendly) back patio was nice and I got there as they were starting to close it down for the night and the bartender was over it. He obliged and served me and a few others who arrived a few minutes later, but he wasn't happy about it. I don't know if they serve their entire beer list in the back or if he just didn't want to have to go to the front to get them, but the beer list I got back there was a fraction of the list up front. Still, there were some good options and if that is the tradeoff for having my dog with me, I'll take it.",

    "text": "Over the weekend I had been told about this great new, slightly trendy brewery called OHSO,so when my friend was looking for somewhere to go for St. Patrick's Day that would not be as crazy as the traditional Irish pubs, I suggested we try here.  The friend that referred me to OHSO did let me know that he had encountered some difficulty with their texting system for seating people, so to be aware of some technical difficulties, but that the food, beer, service, etc. made up for it. As I was a few minutes away, my friend texted me that parking was difficult, but that there was valet and that helped.  I arrived about 10 minutes after her and sat in front of the valet station (where I was almost backed into by someone in a handicap spot right next to the valet who didn't notice a car 1 foot behind his/her bumper and required me to hold my horn down to prevent a t-boning incident in the parking lot).  I sat at the valet station for ~ 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged while I watched the valets run back and forth to help other people.  At first I thought I was being punished for honking my horn (& keep in mind that since I couldn't move my car, neither could the person trapped in the handicap spot, even though I had scooted as far forward as possible to still be by valet and try to let the car out).  Finally a valet approached my car and told me that they had closed valet service (keeping in mind it was 7:30 p.m.) and that I could go to the back and try to find something myself.   I'm glad someone finally told me, but to close so early, what??? So, I drove to the back to fight for parking, which was restricted, annoying, and now had made me late to dinner because of my wait time, etc. But, all of that aside, I decided to go in and enjoy my meal.  I wasn't sure if it would be crowded due to the holiday and there appeared to be an event (meet-up type?) outside with people in green & name tags, but my friend had already been seated and the restaurant itself did not look that crowded. I ordered a soda, a drink, and a meal.  For some reason, any type of beverage appeared to be something my server could not remember, as my soda was thrown down as an afterthought and I had to remind him about my drink, which came about mid-meal.  So much for ordering additional beverages throughout the night! I should have probably ordered a burger, but thought I would order the chicken salad sandwich to balance out my fries (it made logical calorie sense in my head, I swear).  The fries were passable, but the sandwich was probably something I could have done at home. My friends swear that I need to give this place another chance and despite our service, the valet drama, and the semi-o.k. food, I'm not sure if this will be on the top of  my list for a while until I decide to maybe return and try a burger??",

After we were seated (we still had the drinks we were already working on) no one came for at least another 30 minutes, and I'm not exaggerating. When our waitress finally came she asked if we were going to want to order anything. Um, why did we ask to be seated at a table and not just keep sitting in our comfy couches by the bar???

    "text": "Four stars for beer and the patio, one star for most of the food. OHSO is a fun neighborhood spot that has a huge selection of local craft beer, including some made in house. You can even make your own and have it on tap. The draft beer can be a bit warm if it's one of the less popular taps, as the beer has to travel a ways from the refrigerated keg room to the tap. So that's my only complaint about the beer: you might get a warm glass once in a while. The back patio is great: dog friendly, with fans and misters, and CROWDED on weekends. Quite a scene, but the crowd runs the gamut from early 20s to well heeled Arcadia neighborhood denizens in their 50s and 60s.  The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I feel like the menu is a bit large and ambitious for a craft beer bar, or for what the kitchen can pull off. Food is uneven and sometimes the quality isn't what you'd expect. Examples as burned burgers that are ordered medium rare, or shrimp tacos that (I swear) used poached cocktail shrimp and store bought mission tortillas. I feel like the fold could be so much better if they streamlined a bit and found a \"theme\" (right now it's american, mexican, Asian, and a few other things). I wouldn't come here for the food alone.  But if you're looking for something to munch on while you drink your beer the kitchen will be just fine.",

They have plenty of vegetarian options, and are eager to make substitutions. I crave their sweet potato fries more often than I'd like. Also, the veggie burger is their own hand-made patty and it's freaking delicious.  It's a very laid-back atmosphere. They have a few flat screens at the top of the bar, so you can sit outside and watch sports. It's also my favorite spot to puppy-watch! Most people who sit in the back patio have their dog with them.   If you go during happy hour, I recommend you try the happy hour food. The pretzels are super soft and the cheese dip is great, and I love their hummus + cucumbers app.",

I have had some of their food and it's OK, I should try this place out for dinner sometime.. but so far my rating is all about brews, clientele, atmosphere and service.   The positive.  To tell you the truth, I like it - all of it. I feel relaxed here and I enjoy a place where you can sit down and just unwind over good conversation, because it isn't obnoxiously loud here. It is like a patio should be. The beer is tasty, and there is a feelgood vibe on this dog friendly patio.   Funny story. I sat here with some veterans and enjoyed a Friday afternoon as the sun went down. When I was paying my bill I realized that the waitress had charged me for a drink to little. I told her about it, and she replied with \"Sorry, consider it military discount\" and a smile. Needless to say I tipped her well.   The negative. The men's room has one toilet and one urinal. This means that there will be a line on occasion. Another thing, that other awesome yelpers have said before me, is that I don't like valet parking. I don't.   In Summary -  it's a pleasurable visit. I would take out-of-towners here for a light meal and drinks before going somewhere else. Not saying that this place dies down as the night progresses, I just don't have that knowledge. If you haven't tried it out, please do.",

This is the bar you want in your neighborhood, luckily my boyfriend lives close by. If I could walk I suppose I'd be in trouble.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the staff and patrons are friendly, and we ran into a few people we knew. For beers lovers, this is a dream come True. Tons of beers to try, brews you've never heard of, a rotation of the menu, and OHSO is soon to brew their own beer. DREAMY!  I've heard mixed reviews from people regarding their food. We only had the Yucca chips and guac to munch on, which were good. I'll have to grab a burger soon, I'll sure I'll be back very very soon. I love trying new beers and with tasters I can try everything and move on to having pints of my favorite.  So far I love the OHSO Raspberry Wheat Ale and the White Chocolate Ale. The Up River Lager from Mudshark was pretty tasty. The Two Hearted Ale was a bit too piney and hoppy and the Organic Chocolate Stout is for coffee lovers, which I am not. 5 down, many to go!",

We shared the Green Chili Pork Tacos and I am OBSESSED with them.  Absolutely to die for.  They came with a slaw that really complemented the spice and gave them nice texture.  We also had the Chicken BBQ flatbread pizza.  Tasty, but the tacos remained the star of the meal.  The hummus was another good choice that our friends shared with us.  I had a couple of the 48th Street Fizz cocktails - they were strong and absolutely delicious.  This is a great place to hang out with friends and grab a bite to eat that is above your typical bar food fare.  It can be a bit of a scene, but that is part of the fun when it comes to people-watching, right?!",

I frequently come here and wish I could give it a higher rating, but their food just doesn't stand up.  5 Stars - If you're coming here just to drink/go to a bar The pros: - Dog friendly: You can bring your dog to the patio at night, they have carabiners to hook up leashes, water bowls, and complimentary dog treats - Awesome beer list: It's really extensive with lots of good choices - Happy hour is a great deal: $6 pitchers - 10$ beer brunch (breakfast pizza is your best bet) - The ambiance/atmosphere is really great - Bicycle friendly: you can bike down the canal to get here  2 Stars - If you're coming here to eat The cons: - The food is really hit or miss, you have to really know what to order and the better dishes are still just average. - The small plates are not a good value, very little food for the $ - Burger is okay, would be great if they served it on a better bun - Service is very hit or miss too, mostly miss  All together their food is a fail. This place would be 5 stars if they revamped their menu. The majority of the dishes I've eaten have been mediocre (I've tried several things on the menu). I wish they would change their food quality (e.g. take some notes from Four Peaks) and then it would be perfect.",

Stopped by for brunch and it was seat yourself. OK, that's fine...but it shouldn't take too long for someone to notice we're sitting without food menus or to be offered water at least. After our food came out, we weren't checked on until we were done eating. Tip: don't sit at the high-tops right behind the bar unless you want the bartenders on the other side to be screaming (inadvertently) into your ear.  Prices ($10) are fine for brunch and include a mimosa or 10oz AZ beer. I think the food portions are smaller to compensate though, and I'd rather have more food without a drink if not in the mood for alcohol.  Food matched the price...looked and tasted like it was precooked and scooped onto my plate a la Chipotle.  It was not bad though.    I'd come back with more people during happy hour to try more of their beer selections. Probably pass on food unless something looked really good as it passed by.",

At first glance I didn't know what this place was.  I made my stop across the street at JT's.  Finally, I'm glad a made a stop here.  Felt like walking into a neighborhood bar that was full of . . . well . .  my neighbors!  They have a pretty awesome back patio, but that's not to say that the front is lacking.  Dogs are welcomed up front to hang with patrons. The place itself seemed pretty retro and had that summer camp feel.  They have a huge selection of micro brews and what totally weirded me out was how the bartender remembers which brew was in which tap, since there were no signs or logos attached.  Just plain taps!  Kudos to the person that has to remember all of it!    I ordered a burger with cheese and a side of fries.  My friends ordered the antipasto platter which came with Elk meat -- cool!    My burger was totally awesome with the bacon and cheese.  The patty was nice and juicy while the cheese just oozed over it nicely.  The bun was nice and soft and don't forget to order some nice and crispy fries on the side.  Overall and the bread they used was definitely larger and doughy compared to what I was used to.  The antipasto platter was great and came with honey mustard and some sort of salsa like sauce.  The meats and pickled veggies was what made it delicious!  Never had elk but wasn't bad at all.  The pickled veggies were pungent and hit up my sinuses where it need to.  Overall, good start and good experience - Enjoy!",

    "text": "OHSO is oh so awesome. Like The Dude's rug, OHSO really ties the entire Arcadia Corridor together. Hopefully Nihilists do not take over this joint...  ~Fud/Drink~ Everything here is tasty, from the craft brews they have on tap fresh to the meals they have available. I for one can't think of a more relaxing time in Arcadia than when I sit down here to eat and drink. The variety of beers and drink are superb and the mixed drinks are not over-priced. I have not chosen to try their in-house brews, but I have heard from a few people they are not other-worldly. That is fine, because the variety is there. Food items are tasty and never leave me wondering \"well I wish I went to...\". Happy hour food items are also outstanding and well-priced. Honestly, you get a great rate of return here for what you pay for, no matter the menu item. As you will see in a second, the atmosphere is perfect for the area.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ The theory of a great atmosphere and experience is perfected here by way of the best patio experience in Arcadia. Outside near the canal, you have a bevy of booths to sit at and enjoy your company. The decor outside is fun, with barrels and numerous dog items all around. Oh yes, dogs. I am not a huge dog person, but if I were, I'd love to run the canal with my perro and then hop into here for a quick beer. The patio  is so inviting and allows you to bring the dog, with a dog wash area and biscuits waiting for them. A very relaxed and cool atmosphere, the patio really is the perfect spot for numerous occasions. Inside is equally enjoyable with tons of wide open space for a couple, or 10 buds looking to hang. Service is spot on and quite attentive. I never have had a single issue when coming out to OHSO, they really do a good job of providing top notch quality service.  ~The Downlow/Extras~ One extra for you: My favorite time to come here is on Sundays for their $10 Beer n' Brunch. For the $10 you get a great craft beer, and a super yummy, well-proportioned breakfast. Other than that, this is the best trendy spot in Arcadia for a craft beer or three. 5 stars goes out to them for Well-balanced menus, great variety amongst beer options, solid price points, and a beautiful layout to go with a great atmosphere. Come and enjoy OHSO, it will be your favorite beer spot on this side of town, I guarantee it ;-)",

You also can't beat the Beer Brunch. $10 for brunch AND a beer. I was just recently here for a friends beer tapping party. You can actually purchase a package and OHSO lets you pick out ingredients and brew your very own beer in house and when it is ready, they tap it and put it on the beer list for sale. How awesome is that. All locations I have been to so far are great with large patios and great selection of beer.",

No kale - just broth, dry white chicken, and giant lumps of slimy melted cheese. Ewwww. And it was open air, which probably works when the weather is nice, but it wasn't nice the day we were there. This place probably works best for boozy weekend meals in the spring or fall, but it didn't work for a work day lunch.",

They win all the awards at the ASH events for having supposedly the best bar and restaurant in the valley.  Well... no.  No way.  I went in with a friend and they had around 15ish taps I believe.  We didn't even get our 10th choice of beer.  They were out of everything.  I believe I had a choice between a porter and an insanely sweet 1.X% alcohol beer.  I've never had a good porter out of 100+ tastes of them so I went with the fruit beer.  It sucked, as expected.  Sweet as candy.  The food was a step below mediocre.  Soggy fries, soggy sandwich that was pouring grease.  When I picked it up it tore in half.  Like if you left bread in water for a few minutes.  This place blows.  ASH is ridiculous for giving them any awards.  No beer and bad food.  How does that make it the best beer bar?  I've never heard so many customer complaints from other tables before.  Did I mention it's a bar with no beer?  Review update:  A guy claiming to be the owner of OSHO contacted me on Yelp to say they've never had fewer than 30 beers.  You had TWO BEERS, sir.  TWO.  Your waitress was nice about it, but everybody in there was disappointed.",

It was nice to see a place that catered to dogs as well as humans. Mind you, it's dog friendly, not dog smart. We were going to be seated at a table surrounded by other dogs and when we asked the hostess to be seated at a nearby table because we didn't want to have a dog fight on our hands she looked incredibly annoyed. I didn't appreciate that because it was obvious she didn't care about the safety of the dogs.  Nonetheless, our food and service was really good. I'd definitely go back but maybe on a warmer day!",

Last night we thought we'd try out the patio. Big mistake. There is a bar in the middle of it so that is the focus. It smells like a frat house, like beer spilled on the floor long ago and smoke (Is it legal to smoke in restaurants in AZ? Yuck. Is this 1985?). I wouldn't recommend the back patio unless you're trying to relive your frat days.",

We got the cheese platter which was huge and delicious and by far the best I have had anywhere for a great price. 4 of us split it, and honestly, I didn't even need to order dinner because it filled me up. But, I did order the romaine salad which was fantastic. I tried my husband's brisket sandwich and the sauce was to die for. My friend had the cheeseburger which she said was only okay, but that was on the expectation that it would be fantastic because the cheese platter was so good. The beer was decent; my husband who is a brewer actually was not that impressed. But overall I thought the food was wonderful and I would definitely go back.",

They have a whole wall dedicated to their biker customers with locks and several tools for all your bicycle needs. They have a lot of bike parking right off of the canal next to the outdoor patio. I was so surprised to see the amount of dogs that people brought! They just hangout in the booths, either on the floor or in the seat or even underneath the booths. OHSO provides free dog treats and water bowls to keep your dog happy. We came to brunch on a Sunday, so of course they had all the football games playing around the bar. OHSO has a great Sunday brunch special which includes a 10 oz beer and a choice of one of their brunch dishes for $10. Even without the special their normal prices are awesome, with pitchers of quality beer for only $9!  We got the breakfast flatbread and a pitcher of Orange Blossom, that's from Papago brewery, and omg they were both delicious. The orange blossom had a unique taste of oranges and a hint of vanilla, it was hard not to chug all of it immediately! The flatbread was amazing, it had eggs, spinach, Spanish chorizo and much more I can't remember. You could taste the great quality of the ingredients they used! I saw a LOT ( i mean a lot) of people get the biscuits and gravy, which you would think is ordinary but they put a classy twist on the dish, I will definitely try it next time, it looks so good! The couple next to us also had bloody Mary's and it looked amazing too! Ill try that next time too! I plan to know OHSO like the back of my hand within the next few years because its an amazing place and we live very close! Can't wait to come back!",

An hour goes by and no entrees. Our waiter glances at us every 15 minutes but does not say anything to us. We finally ask about our entrees and he claims the kitchen staff accidentally placed our order in the completed pile. He did comp our drinks and appetizer though.

Lots of beers on tap, but both of ours were hardly cold, and my husbands was flat.  He had the Pisa Flatbread, it was okay, nothing to drool over.  I had the steak skillet thing... what a mess.  Hardly any meat, and it's just a bunch of soggy french fries mixed with onion, pepper and some cheese.    I usually enjoy checking out the Restrooms, as so many now adays are interesting... didn't even bother here.  And they have valet parking!!  Really!!?  This place doesn't justify it.  Big disappointment....  OK....  after I did this review, I got an e-mail from Jon, one of the owners.  Was very surprised.  Glad to know that they do pay attention to us Yelpers!!  Good business Jon, and I hope that my review does give constructive feedback....  with such a response, we may give it another shot!!    Good luck",

    "text": "I've been to OHSO once with a friend and another time with a date.  I was excited to first go there due to their large arizona beer selection on tap.  Walking in, the place has a very industrial Arcadia look to it.  You could think of it as the Vig but with exposed cement board in the ceilings.    The crowd is a nice mix, but I never got passed the vibe.  It feels like a neighborhood bar where everyone knows each others name, but I don't know anyone.  There doesn't feel like there's any energy to the place.  Looking at the food menu, it's uninspired.  My friend ate lunch there and said it was nothing that great.    The thing I don't get is no happy hour.  Okay okay.. there's happy hour.. but it's until 5pm.  I don't work dental office hours and neither do most of my friends.  With so many other places offering a better vibe, food, and happy hour within a mile, I just don't think I'll be going back again.  I can sum up the whole experience to what happened on our way out.  OHSO is like the candy jar my date and I saw when we walked out.  She was excited to see it and grabbed one.  A few seconds later she made this sour face when she found out it was black licorice.",

If there isn't a clear meaning, then you're lame for having a name like this.  Please, drop the act.  They don't brew their own beers as of now.  They're contracted out by someone else (Grand Canyon I think, which doesn't have a good reputation for award winning beers).  Large tap selection, but sadly it is heavily skewed heavily towards Arizona beers which are not exactly highly rated, nor sought after by those really into great craft beer.  Luckily they still have some of the better regional beers from California & Colorado (among others) on tap as well.  Food is extremely high in price, excluding happy hour.  Maybe they'll do better than the failed German places in this location before it.",

    "text": "I like this place. I'm rooting for it. It has some good things going for it, and some not so good things.   The Good It has a good beer selection. I love a place that has good beers and not \"many beers on tap\" that prove to be the stuff sold at 7-Eleven. It's broken down into AZ based beers, and non-AZ beers to explore.   The place is also has nice decor. It has a minimalistic vibe, still feels local and can see it becoming a go-to place for people in the area.   The Bad Understand, I'll give a \"get out of jail free\" card here because the place is new and I do plan on going back to see how it matures, but for now, it has some growing pains.   The service has been hit or miss. I've been several times. When busy, I have to fight for attention to place an order. When slow, I still need to call attention to the servers. If you're busy, that's fine. If you're slow, don't hang around with the other servers and chat. Once they discovered us, they were attentive.   The food is average. I can understand this for a place wanting to be known more for their beers, but when you're official name includes the word \"eatery\", the food should be good. I've had the flatbreads and they can be better.   Final comment is that I'm excited to see how their own \"nano beers\" turn out. I believe they are not allowed to sell their own brews just yet. Will be interesting to see how this place matures.",

    "text": "Our second experience at OHSO was much different than the first. After our last visit the owner, Jon was kind enough to reach out to us, invite us back and try to better the situation. His invitation coincidentally fell on the same night a friend was hosting a mixer  for an amazing charitable organization, \"Long Way Home.\" OHSO allowed our group to sit in the cozy room off the front patio and even donated a portion of the proceeds from each bill to the cause!  When we arrived the place was packed. There was another event going on simultaneously on the back patio. The restaurant offered complimentary valet parking. I wanted to spare myself the embarrassment of having the staff sit in my filthy car so we parked across the street. :)   Our group staggered in throughout the night and by the end we had upwards of 25 in our room. Our table ordered the veggie flat bread, the brisket sandwich, the spinach crab dip, fish tacos and a few pitchers of beer. The food was fresh, and filling, yummy and came out quickly especially considering how  busy they were. Everyone in our party received their food and drinks efficiently and seemed to be having a wonderful time. Our server Janell was attentive and accommodating to our entire group.   The owner Jon was in house and came by to check on our group and make sure all was going as planned. Thanks Jon, manager Stuart and the rest of the OHSO team for taking good care of us. It's great to see a small business owner so caring and conscientious of his customer's needs.   On our way out, we picked up a few FREE peanut butter doggie cookies at the host station. OHSO is dog friendly, I'd love to bring our dogs for a visit, but they're a bit too nuts for the laid back environment.  Thanks again OHSO for a lovely evening. My BFF lives down the street so we will be back.",

    "text": "Drive past this place every day to and from my trek to work. I first noticed it a few months ago when they put up the signage. The cool, sans serif font and brightly-lit sign caught my attention. As a designer, I'm always intrigued by good design. So I had this one in my mental \"to do\" list for quite some time.  Finally hit it up last night and admittedly was not impressed. Upon walking in, it seemed very bare. I'm all for minimalism, but it didn't seem designed that way on purpose. It felt like when you live in a big house with not enough stuff to decorate it. The layout was sort of odd and it just felt empty. Granted, we went when it wasn't very busy, but still. That was what I immediately felt upon walking in.   I ordered the prosciutto salad and my friend the cheeseburger with gnocchi and bolognese. They had a pretty good beer selection, but neither of us felt like drinking so will have to review that at another time. The service was pretty fast and our server was very pleasant, as was the rest of the staff we encountered. The presentation of the food was attractive, so I can appreciate that. But I found my salad to be fairly bland with not enough dressing. I don't even like a ton of dressing, but it was just an awkward salad to eat, if that makes sense. It came with some homemade cheddar crackers which were also somewhat bland. I did not try my friend's cheeseburger, but he said it was pretty standard. Good but not amazing. The gnocchi and bolognese was way too sausage-y and didn't seem like anything special.  Overall, a little to pricey for mediocre food. i like their concept/design and think they could take it a lot further. (hire me!) ;)",

Always can go for a good burger, know a lot of great burger places in the Dallas area but having been away from Phoenix for more than 20 years, I really didn't know where to go here until my friend suggested OHSO.   I don't drink so I can't comment on the quality of the beer first hand but my son was happy with his choice.   I got the Arizona Burger, ordered it \"pink\", the other choice is \"not pink\" but that's just not right (by that I mean, who wants a burger cooked all the way through? Kills the flavor!)! As busy as they were, I was pretty surprised it only took us about 10 minutes to get our food. I ordered it with the onion strings on the side but didn't get them at all. Either the waiter couldn't hear me too well because it is pretty loud when they are busy (and they were packed on a Friday night) or the kitchen forget them. No biggie. Fries were pretty good but more warm than hot. Glad they came with the burger because ala carte they are pretty pricey for french fries.   The only real negative is the parking. The lot isn't very big and the dry cleaners next door has \"no parking' signs threatening towing all over the place. I can understand that if they are open but when we were there it was closed. Not sure if they tow cars after the dry cleaners is closed but I wasn't taking any chances and was glad I snagged the last spot. When we came out, the spots at the dry cleaners were full. Plus there was a huge line at the door.   Definitely will be back next time I'm in town.",

Our pups loved the attention and being able to see all the other dogs. All of the food was delicious! I had the fruity pebble french toast, which was very sweet but came with bacon to even it out. The mimosas were well priced and quite good. Great for brunch, lunch, or dinner!",

Tried quite a few different ones. But let's talk about the food. Delicious.   We had a few different dishes, and I got to try some of them. I would have to say that hands down, the mac and cheese with brisket was the most flavorful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's wondering what to get.   I also love how this place is so dog friendly, and has also plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating. It's pretty clear that you could have a pretty big group function here and have a great time. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good beer, good food, or a space good for groups (and/or dogs!)",

We ordered the chips and guacamole, Italian strata, Fred's French toast, and mimosas.  -The chips an guac were delicious. What made it different from others is that the guac had dried cherries and bacon in it. It was good though! -The Italian strata had good flavor but I think it had TOO much bread and too many carbs. It lacked texture. It was basically all mush with the bread and taters. That kind of was bad ordering on my part. Should have expected it when I read it on the menu. -Fred's French toast was scary because it had fruity pebbles and lemon mascarpone. I was nervous about trying it but OH MY GAWWWW IT WAS BOMB. The flavors worked. The fruity pebbles complimented the mascarpone perfectly! It was tart and fruity! Beware though, it's a bit on the sweet side. -The mimosas were awesome! No complaints there.  I would love to come back and try the rest of their menu!",

A bar area in the center front of patio awaits patrons. Doggie pics surround booth seats. It was neat to see all the dogs getting along. Even a table of 4 each had a dog!   Service: food literally took 30 to 45 minutes after ordering to get to the table. Pretty bad if you ask me especially if cooking a burger takes that long to prep and cook. Thumbs down. :/  Beer Brunch (without the beer):  Smoked sockeye salmon on a bed of arugula with pita bread and capanota and a mimosa - A simple plate to put together...anyone can do this. A light affair if you ask me ;) For a weakling like me, I prefer a virgin mimosa.

Good beer, fabulous patio, and good happy hour. Love the dogs. Tried the Strawberry Blonde Ale - very cool!  I would love to LOVE this place, however . . .  The Average - The food is nothing special. There is nothing bad about it but I would never come twice to eat their food. There is so much better bar food in Phoenix that they should do better. The brunch is Average plus.   The Bad - I've never been a fan of their service. The inmates seem to be running the place. We seem to be props in their lives.  A mere inconvenience.   The Ugly - We took half a hamburger home and found a hair in the burger. That'll turn you off of a place for good. I don't remember that ever happening to us before. Ever.    Conclusion - I'd love to add this fun place to our regular rotation. The vibe is great. I'd love to bring our outoftowners. However, they have to get serious about the quality of the food and service.  I don't believe they think they're a restaurant. Maybe they think they're in the \"aren't we cool\" business.  Maybe they're right. Maybe we should all just bring the dog, drink the beer, and stop ordering that distracting and forgettable food that seems to come with the annoying or absent servers.",

I had the Brewer's grilled cheese sandwich, and it was a perfect combination of good bread, crispy bacon and fontina cheese. Oh, and a tasty mustard sauce.  I ordered the little salad instead of fries.  My husband chose the fries as the side on his brisket sandwich meal, and I was a little jealous.  They were delicious.  So was his sandwich, which came with crispy onion rings and a green chili cheese sauce.   Nice to have such a good option, and next time maybe we will bring the pup and sit on the patio.",

It's laid-back with an expansive patio, a diverse drink selection, and some cool eats.   They've got plenty of their own brews with everything from dank IPAs to coffee/chocolate porters to fruity stuff for the rookies. If you're looking for liquor, there's a modest cocktail menu featuring no shortage of flavored vodkas, even some crazy stuff like horseradish or rosemary!   You'll be content to enjoy the drinks alone, but I really liked sampling the small bites here, which at the time of this review were just $3 for small plates that are *big* on flavor. The pretzel is great. The cream cheese wontons drizzled with chili sauce were even better. I can't wait to try some entrees from the full menu.   Overall, OHSO has something for everyone, and you could enjoy visiting at any time of day. Come thirsty and leave happy.",

They had tv's and fans going. We were here during a shift change and the service was smooth throughout.   The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is because I felt like the food was a little overpriced for what you got. We ordered BBQ chicken fries that were delicious, though!",

They have parking out front and around back.. they also have a hostess in front & back so make sure you know where the rest of your crew is waiting!!   Hostess and wait staff are very pleasant and friendly. Cool industrial bar with great food.. they checked on us often and definitely understood we were a work group and gave us that space to eat and work \"meet\"  We started with the butchers block .. yum! Great way to start .. Included Brie, salami, fig jam, almonds, roasted tomato, mustard, dried apricot, garlic bread, iberico cheese.. sausage (added $3) yum!  I had the Cobb salad and added grilled chicken.: very filling .. the corn was a different twist .. I couldn't finish the salad because that butcher board had my full attention.  I will definitely be back to try some of the brunch items!!  I love that you can follow the white painted paw prints on the ground to find the patio out back!! Dogs are allowed on the back patio!",

The food has always been delicious and fresh (for dinner and brunch) and the ambience is comfortable/casual. The brunch deal of a dish and a mimosa for $10 is honestly unbeatable. They are not known to do reservations, but this time around they were kind enough to hold a table for us since it was a group of 13.  Also, it is important for me to note that one of my friends got the Fruit Pebbles French Toast and the whole table was in complete awe of the looks AND the taste. So maybe that helps you choose what you're eating today.",

Not sure if he forgot about us, but he did disappear for a while.  I had to get up and get my own ketchup.  Drinks stayed empty for too long.    We were on the patio which was busy but it seemed they had enough waitstaff.  The patio is great on a fine April evening. I love how they incorporated fans into the bikes.  Really nicely done.  The patio is also dog friendly.  They really make dogs feel welcome.  Strong work on that.  Now lets talk about the food.  I had the AZ veggie burger.  It was decent black bean based patty.  The bun was fresh and the fries were good.  Decent meal here.   The pear salad on the other hand was not that great.  Gotta pass on this one in the future.  The beers were good.  I thought they made a decent IPA.  Nice spot.  Cool vibe on patio.  Service needs improvement.",

    "text": "We LOVED this brewery...like one of the reasons I would look forward to visiting Phoenix again would be to come here! In December, the weather was absolutely perfect to sit outside and that was a great choice considering the outside seating area is incredible - the booths are lined with these cool iron bikes and the wheels are actually fans for the summer time and it fits the area since there's a really neat bike path that people take to get to the restaurant. How cool! There were plenty of powerful heat lamps out there too if it gets cold. I am a dog person and there were dogs everywhere. I counted at least 10. Love it.  The brew list is extensive and there's something for everyone. We all went for lighter, refreshing beers local to the area and liked our choices. We had just hiked a mountain and were starving so we all ordered full meals instead of sampling apps which is what I usually do at breweries.  We ordered the chicken & waffles, steak with veggies (forgot the actual name but took a photo for reference), crab mac n cheese, and the salmon tacos. All dishes were amazing and our entire party was satisfied. Our waiter was funny and entertaining as well. I especially liked the salmon tacos I ordered - they come \"deconstructed\" so you get to make your own and there was enough salmon for 4 of them! Great portion sizes and a great overall experience! We had a great time just talking, petting the dogs, and relaxing. Highly recommend!",

On the food side of things, I'm a big fan of the brisket Mac and the burgers.  My wife swears by the blackened salmon.  We're here once a week to satisfy her need for it.    The brunch on the weekends is also worth checking out.  This is a popular local hangout.  It is almost alwAys busy, but everyone is very friendly.  Check out the dog friendly back patio.

Not only do they have one of my favorite beers on tap (Papago Orange Blossom), but they have a wide selection that can please any palette. If you're a microbrew junkie, then this is the place for you. Their own house brews are delicious. Not to mention they house local AZ Four Peaks brews which is cool.   As far as their food goes, their flatbread pizzas are awesome, especially the grilled chicken flatbread pizza. For me, the flatbreads are easy to split and then you can order more goodies on the menu! I LOVE sandwiches and their Hot Pastrami does NOT disappoint. It was hot, incredibly flavorful, and filling. What more could you want in a sandwich? On their happy hour I've had the pretzel + cheese and it was awesome. I have plenty to try on their menu, they have so many things that seem tasty.   I've heard great things about their brunch and I love their back patio during the fall and spring when the weather cools back down. You can bring your pups back there!",

That's right they have bike locks plenty of bike racks and tools that you can use if you are in need of a quick repair or tune up. It is also incredibly four legged canine friendly. I always meet a cute or fun dog and owner when I go there. Best bike friendly place in Phoenix!! The food is good. Bar service on the deck is just OK if you sit at the bar because the bartenders are getting killed with the service bar which they run as well. The place more than makes up for that in atmosphere with the bikes and dogs. Great beers and amazing beef jerky are nice treats here. They also have free dog treats!!",

That's ok I settled on one rather than getting a flight.  However, due to the great digs and the wonderfully kind and chatty beertender Justin, I will be back another time for some different beers!!  Thanks Ohso!!",

    "text": "Another great find for my friend! Came here specifically because they are dog friendly!!   It was pretty busy when we were there, just in time for brunch on a holiday weekend so it was to be expected. We didn't wait very long though maybe five minutes?   I brought my pitbull (yes all the way from Vegas as I was visiting friends and no she's not vicious) who would probably rather have sat on one of the chairs then on the ground. They provided water dishes and some pretty awesome doggie biscuits that my pup loved and ate right up. Awesome extra service right there!  So we came here for the beer brunch deal which I think is an awesome deal and more places need to adopt it!   I got the veggie flatbread + beer combo, which I went through two other choices of beer before finally settling on an IPA, they ran out of the most awesome sounding ones that was a little disappointing but won't deter from anything though! I really enjoyed the flatbread which was had eggs, cheese, potatoes, kale, and pico de gallo which I think was a perfect brunch or even breakfast flatbread!! It all came together into this perfect combination, probably because of the potatoes and cheese really that made it savory!  I loved my experience here and can't wait to come back and try some other foods on the menu!!",

I was recently there and had the shrimp tacos and a veggie burger. I can honestly say it was all delicious. I sat at the bar on the back patio I find myself sitting in the back patio area more then any other place here, I just find the back area more comfortable with open seating, and I can bring my puppy.  I like to watch sports on the Tv's and people watch. It always interesting to see people interact with other people and there pets.   I particularly like the Orange Blossom beer. I have to say it is one of the better brews they have on tap. I say I probably come here once a month at least.",

They told us that they had waited even longer. It was my friends birthday and I Didn't want to make a scene but it was just so bad. The place was dirty, sticky and just plain needs some TLC. Also some finishing school for the servers to attempt like they actually care that you are here, smile and show general awareness for your experience.   There are a lot of great places in this hood with higher standards and more care for the customer experience. If you mess up, own up to it and make it right so your customers will come back.

We sat on the patio, which was nice. I actually only had food at this place, so can't comment on the drinks, but I split their bbq burger with the BF and I thought it was really good! Now, it may be because I was drinking, but I ate my half burger so fast it was ridic. This bar has a very relaxed atmosphere and the waiter didn't try to hurry us out, even when the drinking had slowed down. I would definitely go here again!

That said, the selection of all things drink-wise is quite impressive.  I'd say I hope they rotate in some beers and out others, but the choices are so vast that they truly don't need to do that (but I hope they keep up with the vast options).  Even as brewery, it would be nice to have so many choices if you weren't feeling a specific drink.  Tons of delicious choices on the food menu as well.  I love that there are everything from nibbles to full blown meals.  Prices right in line with the other establishments in the area.  It's right along the multi-use canal path, so it could make a great place to stop in for a drink (and food) after a ride around town.  I can't wait to visit OHSO more often.",

It's clean cut, modern with a sweet and not too hoppy tap list.  The list is pretty impressive, half from Arizona and the rest are seasonal beers from known breweries.   Taster's a $1, $2 for the rare beers.    If you're a new beer convert:  Try the White Chocolate Ale, Orange Blossom and OHSO Raspberry Wheat.   For you beer geeks you don't need my advice, though the White Chocolate was my favorite on tap.  Surprisingly wheaty, with milk chocolate body and a clean crisp finish.    My major complaint here is that it just doesn't feel like an authentic beer bar, it looks the part, but its lacks something.  Quoting the bartender, \"we keep what sells.\"  Not exactly a mood lifter.  I know it's a business, but I've come to expect more from my bartenders.  And it's not the best place to spark up a beer chat with your neighbor.    I'll be back for happy hour, it's tough to beat $5 for local beer, convenience and some good TVs .  A note of caution to prevent awkward moments.  Before settling in, check the bar in case you run into your pops.",

OHSO is right by my house but I had never been.  We walked in and were met by an angry girl with a nose ring (doesn't matter but just for identification purposes) who barked that we had to put our name in for a table and a 45 minute wait.  We were a bit thrown off by her attitude but asked nicely if we could look at the bar to see if there were seats.  She grumbled that there was open seating in the bar. We went into the packed bar and there was not a seat but two girls were about to leave a high top.  We were excited and waiting to grab our long awaited beer.  We were then approached by a hostile brunette server who asked us if we had put our name in with the hostess.  We explained that we were going to sit at this bar table.  She snapped that we had to put our name in for this seat in the bar.  We explained that we thought the bar was open seating and she rolled her eyes.  Up walks nose ring girl.  She rolled her eyes at the brunette (as if we couldn't see her disdain) and says she told us we couldn't just sit down.  I felt like we had committed a crime.  My friend and I were over this unwelcoming, ridiculous place...so we told them we were leaving, walked across the street to Arcadia Tavern (had never been there either) and enjoyed a beer in a friendly environment.

My wife (a vegetarian) had the Mediterranean Salad, sans meat, and loved it. I had one of the chicken flatbreads and it was delicious. I'd like to try almost everything on the menu.  The beer list is unique and unmatched from what I've seen so far in the valley. Service was outstanding. Give it a shot. I hope this place sticks around, because we will be back often.",

    "text": "We visited OHSO today for the first time, and went specifically for their beer brunch.  Yes, you read correctly - BEER BRUNCH.  They have several delicious brunch items for $10 apiece, all of which include a 10 ounce AZ beer from their extensive beer menu.  The biscuits and beer gravy were to die for, and the carnitas were pretty good too.  We tried a ton of different beers since OHSO offers 3-ounce samples for $1 each, including 4 or 5 of their own nanobrews.  The wine list also looked great, but we simply didn't have enough time in our visit today to transition over to that side of the menu.  We'll have to go back soon!  Oh - and one of my favorite things about OHSO is their huge, dog friendly patio and bike parking section.  They even make dog treats from spent grains leftover from the beer making.  We will be visiting soon with our furry friends in tow.  Thanks, OHSO!",

    "text": "Anybody who spends a minute on Indian School road cruising to and fro Old Town has been sure to see the Orange Sign of O.H.S.O. teasing them as the latest BARCADIA experience to pop up.  Yet another neighborhood bar/gastro pub which has become the genre of the moment in Arcadia.  I must admit the formula works and if O.H.S.O. is able to keep pace then hurray for all of us.  In this case the 3 star rating represents a perfectly MOR experience.  Starting with design O.H.S.O. stayed True to the area trends with mix material semi-industrial set-up.  It's many nooks and cranny's are probably meant to be quaint and homey but it seems a little busy and disjointed.  And although the place is cute enough, I could not help but feel it was not complete.  Maybe it wasn't. I was lucky enough to grab lunch just a couple of days after it opened, they may have some final touches to put on.  In short I have nothing bad to say but I did not get that wow effect I was hoping for.   As for food - it was one of those menus where nothing really reached out and grabbed hold of me.  I settled for a flatbread on server recommendation.   It was pretty flavorful and for value again not bad, not great I guess just about right.   Another 3 stars.  My service was excellent:  Passionate,  Proud of his new place, knowledgeable and excited.  That was the best part of the experience and the one thing that will bring me back.  My ice tea was full, recommendations sincere and my table clean. What more could I ask for?  It was very refreshing to see that type of pride and enthusiasm from an employee.  The local beer touch was refreshing as well and a great connection to the local community.    In short O.H.S.O. which my server quipped was \"OH-SO tastey\" seemed to be OH-SO, O.K.   There is reason enough to go back and see how it evolves.   As it competes with some of the neighborhoods similar experiences I think it has just a little work to do.  I am always rooting for a new spot and I will do the same for O.H.S.O.",

    "text": "I've heard good things about this place for a while, so when we had some family in town, this seemed like a great choice. We don't need anything fancy, just a cool atmosphere, good food, and cold beer.  We all thought the place looked great, a little loud maybe, but otherwise a great concept. However, that's basically where the fun stopped. It was uncomfortably warm inside. At first we thought it was just us, but looking around at other tables, people were fanning themselves. And then, as soon as we sat down, inside, we were immediately swarmed by flies. There were 4-5 flies landing on us, our food, our table the entire time we were there.   Maybe some cold beer could save this experience? Negative. We tried 4 different pitchers. All of them just slightly above cold. They don't supply you with frosted mugs either. So here we are, inside, sweating, swatting at flies, and drinking less than cold beer. Also, 2 of the 4 pitchers, were just flat - The Scottsdale Blonde and the Grovey. When you poured from the pitcher, there was zero head. And it tasted flat.  The food was just ok. Collectively, the skirt steak, the braised pork, and the brisket sandwich were ok, but we all decided, they were a little bland. The surf and turf received high marks however.",

The owner and manager so generously hosted Desert Harbor Doberman Rescue for a happy hour - and they donated 15% during that time period to the rescue - what wonderful people! Our waitstaff was so friendly and helpful - the place was crazy packed, obviously this is the place to be. They are incredibly dog friendly and a lot of people came there on bikes. A lot of people in our group really liked the food they ordered. Really, really good fries. I ordered off the kids menu and didn't love the chicken fingers (kind of a processed taste), but I think that is what I get for ordering off the kids menu - that is probably what kids like. :) So happy that I got to try out OHSO.",

We've been here 2x and both times it was excellent.   It's kid and dog friendly. You seat yourself and the beer selection is written on a chalkboard. They have brunch, and if you go, try the french toast and the breakfast burrito. OH MY, sooooo good! For $10 you get a beer (or mimosa) and whatever they are serving for brunch. Dogs are welcomed in their back patio. They also sell growlers, score!  Service was awesome, both our waiter and the manager came to our table several times.   We'll def be returning soon!",

    "text": "I went here last Sunday for brunch after discovering them on the Whistl App for iPhone.  This is by far one of the best deals in the valley.  For $10, you get a 10 oz Arizona Beer (Or Monster Mimosa), along with one of their 10 entrees. Between three people, to only spend $30, enjoy a beer, and be truly stuffed is a feat for any restaurant in this town.  We ordered the Biscuits & Beer Gravy, the Breakfast Flatbread, and the Green Chile Pork Carnitas. I had the Orange Blossom Beer by Papago Brewing Company, while my two friends each got the Hefeweizen by Four Peaks.  The Biscuits and Gravy is probably one of my favorite dishes on earth. The bisuits are smothered in the the thick gravy, with massive chunks of sausage. To top it off, they put a couple pieces of bacon on top. The flavor was very savory, not too salty or overpowering in any sense.  The Breakfast Flatbread was very unique, turning a pizza into a breakfast It came with scrambled eggs, spanish chorizo, potato hash, caponata, and arugula. The sweetness of the caponata blended perfectly with the chorizo. The potatoes also helped balance the flavors quite nicely.   The Green Chile Pork Carnitas were also very good, but nothing groundbreaking. It was probably the most traditional menu item. It came with the carnitas, flour tortillas, and scrambled eggs. It was fun though putting together my own little wrap with all of the ingredients.   As for the beer, I was very impressed with the Orange Blossom. It was extremely refreshing, and the citrus flavor was not too overpowering. There was some subtle nodes of vanilla, which i though was unusual for beer, but really carried the flavor of the drink.   My friends both said they enjoyed the Hefeweizen. We've always been a big fan of Four Peaks' beers.   We saw some other people drinking the Monster Mimosas, and they are huge! I would love to try one, but the acidity of orange juice does not sit well with me anymore, but I can imagine that they are excellent.  As for the service and atmosphere, I would still give it a perfect 5 stars. The staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable about their food and drink list. The layout of the restaurant is very unique. It has the old style german bier-haus vibe, with a modern american twist. Each dining area has its own style.  I would definitely recommend this place for their brunch. They also do BBQs on the weekends in the evening too.  If youre a foodie like me and want to find other great deals like OHSO, definitely check out the Whistl App on the App Store. It's free to use, and I've already found several new places in the Valley that really rock!",

    "text": "I'm not gonna front: I applied to work at O.H.S.O., the new Arcadia eatery and nano-brewery, and did not get a call back. For that reason, I totally understand if you feel this review to be biased.  That being said, I will probably be at O.H.S.O. everyday. I live in the neighborhood, am unemployed, and they have pitchers of Arizona beers for 5 dollars till 5pm. Hello alcoholism! When I saw this deal, I saw my life flash before my eyes and it involved a lot of weight gain mixed in with a heart attack. Unfortunately, I only saw this offer after ordering a soda. (I was sweaty and out of sorts, don't judge.) So, my future would have to wait.  I'm also a vegetarian and while there are options-thankfully!-for us ninnies, I don't feel comfortable basing my entire review for things not applicable to a vast majority of the general population. Just know that. That being said, I got the veggie burger with a side of yucca chips and \"dipping sauce.\" The dipping sauce turned out to be guacamole. Why they couldn't just be out in the open-it's 2011, people aren't scared of guacamole, y'all-was confusing. I felt mislead. I want some unknown dipping sauce! That's would be exciting.  But that is not reality. The yucca chips tasted like thick regular chips of good quality. The veggie burger came on a buttery challah roll and featured some cherry tomatoes that had been marinated and some greens. The actual patty tasted pretty much like a soft, large falafel croquet. It had no sauce on it from what I can tell. I asked the bartender if a condiment should be put on it and he was like, \"I like ketchup and mustard on it.\" This, I guess, is valid. It's marketed as a burger but it still seems like heresy. Everything else is abnormal about it-why would I put on the default condiments? Maybe some tsatziki?  At the end of the meal, I had three samples of three beers for one dollar each. (Confused?) Two were from Arizona-a cream ale and Good Vibrations-and the third was from Montreal and made the other two seem like some ugz stepchildren of a beer master. So tasty, Canada! While you'd get strange looks, if you were to order 4 of the Montreal samples it would be the same amount of beer for fewer bucks than normal. Is it worth the scorn of your bartender? That is for you to decide.  The main space is chill. In the interview, they noted how they wanted people to feel comfortable and stay for awhile. The furniture, airiness, and instructions to grab a seat wherevs ably connote this. There are TVs but they are not intrusive.  The owners were rushing to get this restaurant open and while maybe no one else cares, I feel like they could've done a bit better with the bathroom. It has been barely remodeled from the old space, which is most noticeable because everything else looks so lovely. Except this weird, changing-color-announcement-board imploring you to try a beer in the foyer-that also seems out of place.  In spite of these missteps, I'm down with what these people are trying to do. They have plenty of bike parking, they play decent music, they have a good menu, they're friendly. It is hard for things to come out as envisioned. (To wit: My food photography. Do you know how awesome that was gonna look in my head?) With time and work, I imagine things will get better.

    "text": "First off, let me congratulate OHSO on being open for business!  I was thrilled to see another local watering hole open in the neighborhood.  I frequent Arcadia Tavern and JT's often and will most likely add O.H.S.O to the rotation.  Upon entering OHSO, I remember my first impression being \"Is this place really ready to be open for business\".  I noticed a few unfinished details on the building (maybe intentionally) that left me wondering if this place decided to open overnight.  Simple said, I appreciate good service.  There was a lack of this at O.H.S.O.  We were not greeted when we walked in.  There was a group of employees talking at the host stand and I had to approach them before they recognized our group.  They quickly said it was open seating and got back to their converstaion.  We grabbed seats in a booth in the bar area.  We probably sat there for about 5 mins trying to make sense of the various colored menus strewn across the table.  As we were all very thirsty for a cold beer, we decided to finally order at the bar.  Someone eventually came by.  After some of our party left, 2 of us moved up to the bar and asked the bartender a few questions.  No one seemed to know what was going on.  Everyone appeared to be extremely busy with \"busy work\" instead of helping the patrons.  Seemed like a lack of training with the staff.  Overall, I think this place has the potential to be a cool spot and truly hope it does well.  If I could offer a few suggestions, they would be:  1.  Have a dedicated host(s) greet people at the front door.  Take a hint from Arcadia Tavern.  I have never walked in there and not been greeted by a friendly smile. 2.  Get the music in order.  If you want to a progressive/hip local brewery, you are going to have to do better than a \"killers\" album that was popular 4 years ago. 3.  You have something that people want...BEER!  It's great service and attention to detail that will keep patrons coming back.  I look forward to my next visit and I hope some of these kinks are worked out.",

We started off with the OHSO Green Chili Dip. It has a bit of a kick to it, but was great. Highly recommend it. The brisket and pesto chicken sandwiches were also amazing. You get a lot of good food for your money.  Beer: The selection is huge. The best thing my GF liked is that for $1 you can get a 3oz sample of most beers.

It was dark in there and beautiful outside so I spent some time at the front bar chatting it up with random people. I'm glad I did that because I wouldn't have enjoyed sitting inside in that dark room on a gorgeous fall day in Arizona.  I purchased the pitcher of beer at the bar. Our waitress (tall, blonde hair) was obviously upset that I didn't order from her, but the bartender advised me to ignore her. (Good advice). I learned from friends that the waitress  had neglected to tell our group about the pitcher special. One pint of beer is $5 and the pitcher with 2.5 -3 pints is $6. That's a great deal, but $5 for a pint during happy hour- not so much. So what did people in my group do? They ordered the $5 pint not knowing about the pitcher deal until I told them. That is NOT good service on the waitress's part, but I'm rating 4 stars instead of 2 because of that delicious beer and nice bar/patio atmosphere so close to home.  *Side note* $6.50 for a small bowl of over cooked shoestring fries is about as ridiculous as a $5 pint during happy hour! Get real with your pricing O.H.S.O.!",

Great foot, tons of beers Local and national. They are very involved with the community. The food was above average and the beer selection was outstanding. For Scottsdale, $5. pint is very reasonable and $9, pitchers. Shea the server mentioned they have dog biscuits. I brought one home and my dog went nuts. He loved it. I will be back, this time with my dog!",

    "text": "While driving around exploring the Arcadia area, decided to stop in and try OHSO's location on Indian School Road to compare it to the Tatum location.  Other than parking being somewhat limited (at least valet service was available), the service,food and ambiance were great.  The menus appears to offer a few things that are different from the Tatum location which is great, since it allows for some variety.  Word of caution, the portions can be rather large so if you are not too hungry expect to take your left overs home.  I tried the brisket sandwich which was excellent, tender, lots of meat and just the right amount of BBQ sauce and toppings. Let me just say that I have to cut this thing into quarters in order to eat it.  Like Tatum they have a large selection of house and local guest brews on tap as well as bottled beers from out of area breweries.  Certainly recommend stopping by for lunch or dinner if you have a chance.",

You don't find me at a brewery pub very often as I'm not a huge beer lover but the fam was on vacation and the kids couldn't wait to try out a local brewery hot spot. O.H.S.O. was the perfect lunch spot on the way from the airport to our hotel.   If I had to base my review on first impressions I wouldn't give this place many stars. Just driving by it doesn't look like much other than a building with a few orange awnings. It's a good thing we listened to Sara W. who kept reinforcing their backyard and patio area. She was right! On a Thursday over the lunch hour that's where everyone was. The outside patio area is surrounded with large booths and ample seating. Simply lovely and a fun vibe.   There are 40 plus brews on taps but since this is a brew pub there's wine and other cocktails available too. I have to say our food was delicious and the service exceptional. If you're a guacamole fan you do need to order that as a starter. Bits of corn and dried cherries in there. Trust me it's incredible!",

I was very impressed with the service beyond belief. He was very sweet and very knowledgeable about the restaurants menu.  My sister ordered the chicken and waffles and they tasted amazing. And I ordered the biscuits and gravy. It wasn't my favourite dish but it was still well made and tasted okay.   All breakfast orders came with a monster Mimosa which was awesome. These mimosas are very strong. And very well worth the price if you're going to order them separate.   The waiter also separated all of our checks without even having us tell him which was super amazing on his part. I have been very impressed with this location.   The restaurant itself is very clean.

The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is they don't have any vegan options. We would visit way more often if they did. So many people out there are on plant-based diets and with the rise of Beyond Meat and the Impossible Burger (even fast food joints are using it), it's time for OHSO to get with the times. Also, places like Scramble and Snooze use egg replacement options like \"Just Egg\" so we end up going there instead. But I love OHSO and would rather go there for the beer/mimosa brunch egg bowl if they used egg replacement. Please OHSO, help a brother out.",

It was a beautiful day so I chose to go out back to the bar outside and it was a dog lover's dream! I was surrounded by cute dogs and pups - all who were on their best behavior :)  Decor is very cute and the place is kind of separated in different sections which is cool. I would recommend sitting out back if you can in the outdoor area, though.  I tried the grapefruit vodka and cucumber vodka (both just with soda water) and enjoyed them both a lot. For food, I got the brisket mac and YUM! It was sooo good. I thought I would save some for later but I ate pretty much all of it. Great flavor, good chunks of brisket, and delicious crispy onion strings on top. I highly recommend it.",

Coming from California, we were looking for something that's not in California and this place fit that criteria.  For the experience, decor and other food items, I would give this place 4 stars.   Restaurant had indoor & outdoor seating. The decor & lighting was a bid dim, but set a nice bar/brewery ambiance. Restaurant was very dog friendly as well. They offered doggie bags and had some paw prints on the floor leading up to their doggie area (so cute).   Ordered a cheeseboard for an appetizer- Roughly $18, but had a nice presentation.  The Pb&j burger was pretty good as well, but I've tried juicier ones before.   Beer selection was pretty good! Offered lots of local Arizona drinks.   Customer Service wasn't bad either. Staff was pretty engaging, but had to break the news that they ran out of beef jerky for my cousin's Bloody Mary (but at least they were humorous and honest  about it)!  Again, rating this place highly for the Mac and cheese. It was something to remember. Enjoy :)",

If you love dogs this is a heavenly location, as it's pet friendly on the patio. If you don't like pets or allergic their is always the indoor option. At this location I don't think I've ever sat inside but the service is always great so I bet is a great option.   All of the OHSO offers a Saturday and Sunday brunch. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their brunch menu. The plus, with a brunch order you can get a free mimosa or beer. Definitely can't go wrong with that.",

It's dog friendly and it was great to see all of the little \"human dogs\" as I call them. The dogs are allowed on the patio areas and I enjoyed walking through with my boyfriend and his dog and seeing all of the different dogs either sitting at the bar, at the tables or on the ground ready to greet the other dogs as they walked in. The environment is very cozy and hipster chic. The staff is abundantly friendly and the people that come here seem to be very friendly and chatty as well.   Now to the food that disappointed me. I ordered the Blackened Salmon which I thought was going to be a lot more flavorful. The salmon was very dry, the green beans could have and should have been cooked a little longer to give the green beans more of a softer texture. The salmon also came with some kind of veggie that seemed to be either cooked carrots or cooked yams(shoulder shrug)....I'm not sure but it was the most flavorful thing on my plate. Lol. I believe they rely on the creamy white sauce to flavor the salmon but I didn't care for that sauce.   My boyfriend ordered the Mac Del Mar though and it was DELICIOUS!!! I know what to order next time! (Flashes smile)",

It's usually too hard for us to make it at a good hour since it's always sooo busy here, but we got lucky the Wednesday before Thanksgiving this year.  Happy hour is pretty awesome, we got a $7 pitcher of beer and my fiance also got a $7 Moscow mule. He didn't love either, but I liked them so it worked for me lol. We also got the Pretzels & Cheese Dip from the $3 Small Bites menu on HH - these were so good! Just beware because they are in fact really small bites haha.  For dinner, I got the Chinese Chicken Salad which was super good, and my fiance got the The Brisket sandwich and fries which is always amazing (I'd choose that over the salad for sure).  Our server was awesome, too, and she said we were her first table ever! So that was impressive. Def recommend giving this place a try :)",

They have one of the better brunch specials in town. You get a meal and either beer or mimosa for $10-$15. As much as I love beer, I'd go for the mimosa. They are huge and about 90% champagne, just the way I like them. Getting a good buzz here can be quite economical with their mimosas.   This is definitely a fun place to drink and hang out, but I've never been overly impressed with their food. I had the fruity pebbles french toast on my recent trip. It was just a bit too much for me. Also, I normally try and get some sort of nutritional value from my breakfast, so I'm not sure why I ordered it.   Long story short, this is a great place to drink, hang out, and have a nice brunch. The food isn't bad, but not that great either. Parking here is a nightmare, so plan on doing valet.",

I came here during my lunch time to grab a quick bite. Its a cute little spot. Nice clean, service was very attentive and nice.   I ordered the Green Chile Burger with a side of fries. Boy, did it look BIG. I cut my burger it half. It was perfectly cooked to medium, the bun was nice and warm, cheese melted, and tons of chopped green hatched chile. I LOVED that it didn't fall all apart. However, I was SO disappointed that there wasn't much flavor to it. No heat from the chile, no spice. Just a plain burger with cheese. The fries were good, again not much flavor. Maybe the chef went had a light hand ? But I was expecting much more. I will probably give this place one more try due ot all the good review, but I really wouldn't pay $15 for my burger and fries if theres not flavor. It also didn't fill me up. I could definately eat another burger...  ALSO, pet peeve: I paid in cash and the waiter didn't give me back the change, he just rounded DOWN as if I was going to give it to him... After that, my waiter was not around so that I could tell him I needed the exact change back. I was short a dollar and some change. If youre going to round at least round UP so that your customers don't think your jipping them.   Environment: 5/5 Food: 3/5 Price:2/5 Service: 3/5",

The turkey burger was falling apart so bad that half the burger fell out the bottom and the bread ripped all over, in short it was a hot mess. The fries really saved the meal because they were a perfect mix of salty and crisp enough to hold a crunch for the 30 minutes or so I was sitting there. The bloody was also pretty good and had a nice kick to it.  Service was great but I spent way too much money for the subpar meal and drinks I had, nearly $55 for 2 drinks and a burger which is the reason for the 3*, otherwise would have been a 4*.",

Definitely a laid back atmosphere, quite a retreat from the Old Town scene! The food was great. I got the breakfast bowl with egg whites and it was tasty and so so filling! The prices are reasonable considering the free beverage. A great place to bring the pups and relax.",

The spot is very cool, as well as they have a nice mister system outside which keeps you cool in this heat! My husband and I went and they were doing happy hour! They have the best happy hour as it's Monday-Friday from opening till 6! Covers a bunch of beer options that you can have in a pitcher, Moscow mules with literally 9 vodka flavors even horseradish! Lol, that's some brave people to order that :-) I had a glass of the red sangria which was delicious as well! As far as the food, we love loved the buffalo cauliflower!! My husband had the angry bird sandwich which he literally inhaled practically! Haha. I had the pilgrim sandwich which was turkey and cranberry relish which I am obsessed with. So so good. The fries were great. As far as the service goes, it was great. Everyone was friendly and actually seemed to enjoy being there. The vibe is great and we will most Ferris my be back. On the weekends they do a pretty amazing brunch from what the server told us!",

This year we decided to try the food. It's very good - but we were toward the end of our vacation and on beer and food overload, so it seemed just meh. We will always stop as a beer destination - so next time, we will stop here toward the beginning of our trip. Hope to update this to a 5 star after our next visit .... when my stomach is cooperating :)",

Melty cheese and juicy  shrimp and bacon is a fantastic combo, though the crab could have been chunkier.  Their bbq burger is juicy with the best burger bun Ive had.  The  bun is fresh, fluffy, and tasty.  Their other dishes I've tried are good too, but these two dishes are the most memorable. And of course the drinks are yummy.  I'm not a big fan of beer, but their pumpkin and apple ciders are sweet and light.",

I love coming here for weekend day drinking the best.  It gets very busy so often the tables are all taken but if you give it 5 minutes normally a table will open up.  Great food too. I love the white bean dip as an appetizer. And the veggie flatbread is probably my favorite meal there. I always take any visiting friends and family here! And always my pooch :)  This is a great place for people who love riding bicycles to the bar and/or have dogs!  They have free u-locks to borrow for your bike and it backs up to the canal so great for biking to and from. They also have water dishes for your dog, as well as homemade dog treats.  There's hooks to connect your leash to. Really awesome bar!!",

I love being able to take my dogs with me, or stop after a bike ride on the canal.  The servers are great really they can get the large crowds served in good time, some other places you could die of thirst when they get busy. I think their menu is the weak part, a few dishes are excellent like the pastrami and short ribs. They are lacking on good salads their choices are not as imaginative as their beer menu. If they upgrade the menu a little this becomes an even better place.",

It's close enough for me that we can bike there, and they have plenty of bike racks plus tools to help with small bike repairs, and even locks. Their patio is also very dog friendly, complete with water bowls and dog treats made from the spent grain from brewing some amazing beer.   Their beer list always features their beers along with other local beers that are rotating on tap - I've always found something to enjoy to drink (even for brunch - how about a cold brew coffee beer?).   I enjoy their food but I've been so much that I kind of wish they would update their menu with a few new items. My favorite stand-bys are the veggie burger and the fish tacos. You can also substitute any of their regular burgers with the veggie burger or the turkey burger, and they are both delicious. Their fries are good, their brunch is good, their BBQ is good, basically everything is good.",

For my entree I went with the surf & turf which I'll admit I expected to be more of a standard steak with shrimps but was surprised to find it's more of a steak and shrimp melee, but no complaints it was actually quite flavorful with a nice kick to it. So, all in all, no complaints on the food which to me is most important. Our server was good and responsive and the ambience was good although music is definitely on the louder side so it's advised to take the patio or front seats.",

The service was great and I liked the wide open space. We tried two different beer samples for a $1 each and settled on splitting a pitcher of Levitation which we both enjoyed.  We ordered the green chile dip appetizer. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my boyfriend ordered the brisket. He LOVED the brisket and after taking a bite of it, I could see why. It was quite good. My shrimp tacos however, were so bland that I barely ate half of my meal. And it was a \"small plate.\" I wasn't the biggest fan of our appetizer but after tasting my dinner, I decided I liked the dip a lot more and finished it off. Definitely do not recommend the shrimp tacos.  One annoying thing was our meals came out right after our appetizer. A little time in between would have been good - but I'll take that over slow service any day.   I'm giving this place four stars because of how great the brisket was and despite not liking my dish, I had a great time and think this place has lots of potential. I'll be back to try something else!",

Obviously it was a bit impromptu on the brunch so we did not call ahead to reserve seating, and being there was 12+ of us, figured there would be a bit of a wait.  Ended up sitting the patio (a bit hot, as this was during summer), and the downside was that none of the tables are able to move together. Did not mind sitting outside, nice shady umbrellas and misters, but having the group broken up on multiple different tables was a bit disappointing.   Ordered waffles and mimosa, both were very tasty. Did not hear any complaints from any of my fellow crossfitters either!! (And they can be picky! Everyone seemed to enjoy it). On the flipside it was not terribly expensive, a decent price for a decent meal.   I enjoyed the atmosphere, and being dog friendly rules!! I plan on taking my furbaby here for a return visit sometime in the next month or two. Can't wait. Hope the food and drinks are just as good on my return!",

The food is really good, especially their flatbreads, and the staff is friendly and efficient. You can have your dog on the patio and they have treats and water for dogs which is fun. Overall, it's a good atmosphere and an awesome place to bring out of towners to show them a cool local spot. The other patrons are always nice and interesting as well. In fact, pretty much every time I've gone here one of us girls walks away with a date! Good to know for all of you single folks!   Cons: Parking kind of sucks. They do have free Valet but of course you still have to tip. It's not that big of a deal because they do have an ATM inside (which does charge a ridiculously high interest rate for withdrawals of course!) but still, something to keep in mind. Also, I feel like every single time I go there one of the toilets is clogged. Again, not that big of a deal but a pain nonetheless. And lastly, yes, it's fun that dogs are allowed on the patio and granted I know this is out of the restaurant's control so I didn't let it factor my rating, but some of the people that bring their dogs here are really stupid and ironically not what I would call \"dog people.\" In other words, it's hard to relax because you're constantly trying to keep your dog under control but also other people's dogs at bay as well. Not a good time in my book.",

On any given afternoon, you will find the patio occupied by K9's and their companions....there are even complimentary homemade treats for the quadrupeds made from spent grains from the brewing process.  Oh, and if you have the inclination to brew your own O.H.S.O. offers a program where just about anybody can come in and brew, using their equipment and facilities for storage while your beer conditions for a couple weeks.

For $10 you gets a breakfast entree and a 10 ounce beer or a Mimosa.  My breakfast bowl was a little on the dry side, I should've asked for more salsa which was my fault that I didn't ask.

    "text": "Went here on a recent Sunday to celebrate a friends birthday brunch. We had two large tables outside for our group which was nice. I do love the dog friendly patio even though we left our two at home (oh well, next time they will join us). It wasn't to bad sitting outside since they had the misters on but you do fell pretty \"damp\" all over which is better than being hot.   I really liked their brunch menu! You could select a beer or mimosa and an entree for $10. I had a mimosa and green chilie pork breakfast burrito. The mimosa was good and so was the food. The only think I didn't care for was that the only green chilie pork was just a tad that topped the top of the breakfast burrito. Oh well...it was still pretty tasty.  One draw back was how LOUD it got when the World Cup Finals were playing. The volume on the TV was a bit much where I just stopped talking to people in my group because I was yelling so they could hear me and that was frustrating.   I will be back with the dogs but not during sporting events that is for sure.  Service was great this day as in the past it hasn't been the best.",

I love the Arcadia and the 48th St Fizz. Flatbread pizzas are amazing and you cant go wrong with the classic Burger & Cheese!   The staff is amazing, very knowledgaeblw of all the beers and give great suggestions. But what I love the most is the back patio! Might be too hot in the summer, but for 9 months out of the year, it is the place to be! Bring your dog, your bike, and your date- for a night of great suds and grubs!",

I love O.H.S.O. for many reasons- their phenomenal beer selection, the tasty menu, the patio, the free dog biscuits I snag for the pooch- but their beer brunch is the reason I get up most Sunday mornings. For the bargain price of $10, you can enjoy one of several breakfast entrees and an Arizona beer. I'm a huge fan of the green chili pork and the biscuits and beer gravy. They have a great happy hour too with several $3 appetizers and $5 pitchers of Arizona beers.  The only thing I don't love about O.H.S.O. is the parking. It's practically non-existent, but they do have valet.",

A few weeks ago, I decided to go and try their Beer Brunch, only $10 with a beer.  Yes, beer before noon but hey it is a BEER Brunch.  Nobody will judge you there!  The beer biscuits and gravy was awesome! Huge pieces of sausage in the gravy.  The biscuits were moist and buttery.  The gravy had a kick to it for sure but went really well with the beer.  I had ordered the Raspberry Wheat to go with the dish.  Loved it!  The dish came with two pieces of crispy bacon and a bowl of fruit.  I ordered coffee as well.  And the refills kept coming for the coffee.  Service was good..friendly and always coming by asking you were ok and needed anything else.   For only $10 it's a great place for a weekend brunch with friends or by yourself!",

I really didn't enjoy the beers that were brewed in the  building. I had tried tasters of everything, I mean everything!! But, it seems their list is always changing.   I absolutely did love the patio they had. So so cool. Very dog friendly. Great food. Excellent service. And loved the beers that were not brewed in the house brewery!

The negative- the parking Is horrendous and the outdoor patio where dogs are allowed is completely full of pretentious a-holes who could sit anywhere in restaurant but chose to sit at the 6 tables dogs are allowed at and sip on their waters for 2 hours while half of the table are reserved for other larger parties.  The positive- the food, the staff, and the beer selection are truly fantastic, but these terrible patrons sit there staring at you with your dog and and your 2 year old child as they continue to waist oxygen on this earth.

    "text": "7/28/12  Met with a few friends who'd already started drinking during happy hour (read 530p) and finished dinner before I arrived around 840p.  Serendipitously found a great parking spot across the front entrance.  I knew I wouldn't enjoy my stay here when I was hit by such loud chattering as soon as I opened the front door.  That and the scent of rancid beer that greeted me were enough to make me want to bolt, but I'd already let my friends know I'd arrived via text and Yelp check-in.  Found my friends at a four-top, sat down, and proceeded to shout hellos- strike three!  I REALLY dislike having to shout to a person who's sitting/standing right beside me to be heard.  What's even worse is having to nuzzle my ear to their mouth to understand what they're saying...  Really made me wish I was at mellow Four Peaks, already sipping on a cold pint of Peach ale and waiting on dinner to arrive.  I sat at that table for twenty minutes watching at least three different servers pass by without stopping to ask if I needed anything.  Thank goodness I brought my bottle of water with me, or I would've been really annoyed, because not only were my head and ears aching from the noise, but I was also hungry AND very thirsty, as well!  It was only around the 30-minute mark, while I and two other friends were standing by a landing of stairs did a server stop and ask if I had been helped.  By that time, I'd already made up my mind to leave and was already saying goodbye to my friends.  Too bad I couldn't get any love... 3 oz beer samplers are $1 or $2 (those designated with a plus sign).  Would've been a fun way to taste my way through the menu while checking out just how well the servers know the beers they offer- I'm a newbie to the world of beers, but I already know I don't like a lot of hops.  Pints are $5 each (boo!), but $9 per pitcher (awesome!), and that's not even happy hour prices!  A pint of local brewery Four Peaks is $5- what?  I expected to see a lot of O.H.S.O. brewery beers, but I only spotted TWO.  But I shouldn't have even bothered to study all of this since I never received service!",

The outside is really nice, right next to the canal with easy access to walk the pup dogs. They even have an outside wash area for when you need to wash your hands and can't go inside since you got your animal friend with you.  Bartenders are really awesome, I have yet to find one that is unfriendly. Love the 3 oz samples for only $1. The OHSO salad with chicken was good, pretzels were good, yucca chips with dip (it's guacamole. Which I thought was a little weird that they said dip instead of guacamole) was really good. Something different from corn chips.  I love that they started serving up growlers! I absolutly love that I can go less then 2 miles and get a growler filled with yummy Four Peaks and Oak Creek or any one of there tap selections. I can't wait to try out their brew once it's done!  The fact that it is just a bike ride away makes me wish the cooler days would come even quicker!  I definitely recommend everyone try this place out! You just might see me there ;)",

Had a waiter that we have not seen before named JUSTIN...  JUSTIN was a bummer as a our first interaction. We ordered drinks, not a problem,  order food, another story... Like I said we've been going for the last 4 yrs, so we've ordered a lot of food never had any problems with ordering to our liking, and not like we order anything too crazy,  nor are we difficult...But here's  how it is when Justin's taking   your order..... ME: I'll have the Turkey burger- No Pear Compote. But can you please put the Green Chili cheese sauce on it instead  ( this is the sauce from another burger). JUSTIN: OH NO I DON'T THINK SO. OUR KITCHEN DOESN'T LIKE IT IF YOU DON'T ORDER STRAIGHT  OFF THE MENU THE WAY YOU SEE ON THE MENU. IT UPSETS OUR KITCHEN STAFF...LMAO... JUSTIN: I'll have to go ask the kitchen if you can have a different sauce on your burger. ME: NEVERMIND! I don't want to UPSET the staff.  JUSTIN: OK GREAT.  ME: I'll have the Salmon Bacon burger instead  with NO Lemon Aoli sauce, and sliced onion.  ME: IS THIS OKAY, OR DO YOU NEED TO CHECK WITH KITCHEN?  LMAO...  JUSTIN: OH NO THIS WILL BE FINE..  JUSTIN : Puts order in, leaves. Now we are sitting and waiting for another drink. JUSTIN : Comes by 10 minutes  later, looks, Sees I need a drink- walks by, NOTHING.  JUSTIN: Comes by again sits kitchep on table, looks at empty drink- NOTHING! WALKS AWAY. We wait longer still no drink! We move to bar hoping for better service. Get drinks, food is served about 30 minutes later after moving up to bar. Waited at least 45 mins or more for food. Food is served, fries are cold, Salmon burger TERRIBLE.. NO BACON, NO ONION. Had to ask for the bacon- hence SALMON BACON BURGER( how do you forget half of the ingredient) lol. I did not even bother to ask for onion. Cost of burger $14.00. Sorry I ordered it.OVER PRICED FOR WHAT IT WAS!  I had to add a large amount of salt before it had any flavor. BOO! We also ordered a salad, added steak to it which was good, but $16.00  which seemed a lot for what was not that large of a salad, nor was there much of anything on it, but did have good flavor.  BTW JUSTIN- YOU WAS JUST TO LAZY TO TAKE THE TIME AND INPUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THEN WHAT WAS ON THE MENU. IT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DO. I UNDERSTAND ; -)  Order dessert- Add one extra small scoop of ice cream $3.00 extra...   Total bill: $90.05 plus tip. Was not worth it. FYI: BLOODY MARY WITH HOUSE VODKA-$.11.00..BOO! Was basically a glass of V-8 had to order Vodka on the rocks to add to it- Another $9.00 BOO! BLOODY MARY $$20.00 if you want to add a taste of Vodka...lmao... We would have rather spent that money at  Eddie V's Happy Hour. Better service, better food. JUSTIN YOU SUCK!  OHSO was not on point tonight.",

I was disappointed with the arcadia so I had to order an extra shot, which was even more disappointing since it was $7 and less than half of a shot. We made our visit short and left.",

I ordered the Hot Pastrami sandwich with fries. It was a good sandwich. Nice bun, toppings, and quality pastrami. But I was very disappointed with the fries. I think they use the same supplier as Burger King.   My girlfriend and I shared a pitcher of mimosas, so unfortunately I didn't try one of their nanobrews.  The bathroom could have use some attention on our visit.   Otherwise it was a fun and relaxed ambience, and a upscale casual dining experience.",

It's right off the canal and 48th bike trails so easy to get to from Old Town and Arcadia on bike.  2. They have a nice 'backyard style' patio that you can bike upto, they have locks you can borrow and they have awesome bike decor all around that is also functional (bike wheels that are actually fans, bike chains that make up some lighting).  3. It's a dog friendly patio (I counted 15 dogs last time!)  4. Great crowd and beers!  Never ate inside yet but the patio is the place to be, awesome views of Camelback, great people and dog watching and on Sundays you can enjoy their all you can eat BBQ for $15 (and it's a lot of food!).   They have a lot of my favorite beers on tap including an Orange Blossom beer by the folks at Papago Brewery.  Pricing is great on draft beers and I felt like for the experience and delicious food we ate the pricing is spot on.   Go check it out and send me a message on what you thought of it because I think there needs to be more places like this around Central Phoenix!",

Eatery + nanoBrewery .  I couldn't wait to try it out, and knowing it opened just TO-DAY...I jumped at the opportunity.  5 stars might be a bit pretentious, but I'm giving them an A for effort and 5 stars because honestly, I'd leave my office late....night after night ...after night....and would see these guys STILL working at 2 and 3am...just to get the place open. It's apparent there is some serious sweat equity, late nights and blue collar effort to get this place going. I highly respect this and give them props.  Not to mention, I love the simplicity of the place. Yet, I can see it being the new, semi-non-trendy place to hang out. I know I'll be making it a recent stop. Rumor has it...they'll be renting out bikes (check them out as you walk in) and they offer mini-pitchers for $5 before 5 with tons of local beers on tap. It's nothing fancy, frilly or Scottsdale...it's casual and comfortable. My kinda place.  So let's get down to business: Beers on Tap....they carry one of my girly favorites the White Chocolate Ale but this time I went for the Count Hopula and Nut Brown. Both great! The O.H.S.O. Amber was really good as well. Girls who might not be big beer fans might be a fan of the O.H.S.O. Raspberry Wheat although it was a bit light for my palette.  Had some small bites, including the Brewers' Choice which was a mixture of your choice of 2 meats and 2 cheeses, accompanied by caramel popcorn, roasted nuts, bread & butter pickles, a homemade fruit roll up, cheddar crackers and fresh Italian bread. There was also a date/goat cheese butter that rocked and another assortment of roasted veggie/fruit relish. Great starter platter for sure. All the bread is made in-house! The Sharp Cheddar was awesome...the Red Dragon was basically a Mustard Seed cheese (don't choose this option if you hate whole grain mustard :) ) They have rotating meats but on the menu today was a Colorado Elk Sausage....AMAZING! Loved it.  We also added the Crispy Calamari + Spicy Seared Ahi to our assortment. It was great with a citrus zest. Although next time, I need to try the marinated skirt steak.  All in all, I believe this place will be an OH-SO great addition to the neighborhood.",

I have been incredibly blessed continually having Athena as my server. Not only is she well versed in the food and drink items, she explains the dishes with such enthusiastic detail that my mouth is fervently awaiting the first bite. Luckily, the service is quite quick, even on a busy night. Dogs are allowed on the patio making the experience even more catered to my favorite things; cute animals, good food and drinks.",

The sangria is my absolute favorite but can be dangerous! :) The food is good but my least favorite part.",

It is a good deal for their $10 beer brunch, where you get a dish from their list and an AZ brew, which always makes me happy.  I was with my girlfriend and we ordered the blue crab dip to start off.  There was hardly any crab in the dip and the chips were very much stale.  So needless to say it wasn't he best start to the meal.  I did however enjoy my mocha java porter that was an OHSO in house brew.  The rest of the meal was not bad, I got the carnitas bowl and my gf got the bratwurst breakfast.  I'm a potato fiend so definitely they were on point, but for the most part nothing was too extraordinary, but not bad.  I would come back for the beer :)  Cheers",

Now if they can focus on their own brews...  I will try them again, maybe grab a bite to eat next time.  Its a neat place, just go for the guest beers.",

I went for the Pie and Beer event and even though they had run out of pie by the time my friend and I arrived (which sucked even more because I could see other patrons enjoying pie while I waited for a table, and it looked amazing), I was delighted by what I could order, which was 1 Cherpumple beer, 1 Coconut Joe beer (hands down our table's favorite), and 1 Amber Creek. Every beer I had was top-notch. I also ordered the calamari and Ahi Tuna appetizer, which was quite tasty (my friend's friend said it was the best calamari he's had in Phoenix, although I believe that honor goes to Hiro sushi). The burger he ordered though looked amaze-balls.  The beer is definitely the star of the show at OHSO though, which is exactly how it should be.",

    "text": "I took about a 7 month hiatus from OHSO.  I was dragged back kicking and screaming for a friend's birthday this last Friday.    They have a happy hour which apparently ends at 6pm.  Fine.  We got there around 6:05 and ordered a few pitchers of beer.  I will continue to give them praise for their beer selection.  My beer was very tasty.  Our server came by and asked us if we'd like any appetizers to start with.  I had seen on the happy hour menu that they serve a pretzel cheese fondue type thing. During happy hour (which ends at 6), this app is like $3 or something.  It is now 6:13pm.  I ask if I can have the pretzel cheese fondue thingy....aaaannnd....wait for it...wait for it....our server says NO!   I, of course, assume that there is some sort of miscommunication on my part.  I tell her that I fully recognize that I cannot have the pretzel fondue thingy for the $3 happy hour price.  It's 6:13 after all, and the happy hour ends at 6.  So I ask again.  AGAIN SHE SAYS NO!    Undeterred and extremely desirous of the pretzel fondue thingy, I say, Look, I know I can't get it for $3.  Can't I pay you some exorbitant price and get it?  AGAIN SHE SAYS NO!!!  She says the pretzel fondue thingy is ONLY AVAILABLE DURING HAPPY HOUR.  WHAT?!  She then proceeds to tell me that I can wait until 10pm when Happy Hour starts again and order it.  WHAT?!  THE MICROWAVABLE PRETZEL FONDUE FAIRY IS TAKING A 4 HOUR BREAK OR SOMETHING?!  Ok. Ok. Ok.  I get that sometimes you can't order the thing you want.  I get it.  Breakfast at 10pm when you're not at a Denny's? Fine. I understand.  BUT THIS IS A PRETZEL!  A pretzel that was available 13 minutes ago and will be available in another 3 hours and 47 minutes!!!  Crestfallen, I ordered some pesto hummus, a cheese burger, and a couple more pitchers of beer.  All were perfectly fine.  But all I really wanted was my pretzel cheese fondue thingy.  I have never offered to pay more for something and been denied.  Like, literally never in my life.  Why OHSO? Why do you so desperately want me to hate you?",

Odd for a Saturday and the menu is very limited.  The lunch menu starts at 2 and ends at 4 when you get the dinner menu. The wait staff comes around about every 20 minutes whether you want them or not. I guess if you want service you have to go find someone. The prices, for a beer bar are too much.  $11 for a glass of swill wine!!!! Come on!  It is barely worth $4. Needless we did not stay for lunch and won't bother to come back. There are actually a few better places to go around here.",

We were staying in Phoenix from Tucson and wanted to eat at a local restaurant. Our hotel gave us a list of chains, ruby Tuesday's, Applebee's etc, no thanks. I looked to Yelp and found this place. We were traveling with 3 young kids but this place said kid and pet friendly, we had no pets with us but I'd welcome a dog smooch anytime! At first I was worried because the outside booths were very high but they had coloring pages and crayons and there was a bike path behind us and the kids were so well behaved and just watched everything going on. Ok, drink and food selection was fantastic. Great beer selection. I had a mushroom burger with onion strings and it was the best restaurant burger I've ever had. The two other adults loved their food although I don't remember what they had. The kids ALL had Mac and cheese and it was a generous serving with fresh fruit. We WILL be back. Oh and we had a sweet black lab named Henry sitting behind us that would love on the boys :)",

Their biscuits and gravy featured a spicy variation of gravy that I wish I would have had more of.

    "text": "This is probably my favourite place to grab brunch on a weekend. The staff are attentive and friendly, and the food is excellent and very reasonably priced. It is a very popular establishment and is always busy by 10am for the duration of the day. So be prepared for a short wait.  Valet parking is available, but is very reachable via the canal/ walk way from the back of the restaurant so a great stop over for casual cyclists and walkers in the area.  Very dog friendly with water bowls available for all thirsty dogs upon arrival, sometimes just wished that some customers didn't take that as an excuse to allow their dogs to sit up with them at the table, nothing worse than tucking into your chicken and waffles whilst having to stare down an over excited dog.  My favourites on the brunch menu are the chicken and waffles and the breakfast bowl. Interested in the operations of the business and their onsite brewery then you can book a personal tour of where the magic happens all very insightful and a must do.  Looking forward to my next visit.",

Our server was really knowledgeable about the different beers they had and made suggestions if you weren't sure what to order. They also let you sample the beer if you're not sure about that taste. My fiance ordered the surf and turf and I ordered the Cobb salad. Salad was good but i thought it was a bit pricy.The salad is $13 and then $4-5 extra if you want chicken. The surf and turf was very flavorful and had generous portions. I think if they offered some rice or tortilla with the dish, it would make the dish more complete.",

    "text": "I like O.H.S.O.  really.  I just hate restaurants that have zero sound insulation.  Concrete ceilings.  That's what you get here.  Block walls.  What does that have to do with the food, you ask.  Well, that's a good question.  I'm glad you asked the question in writing, because at O.H.S.O., I would have asked you to repeat the question.  Maybe a couple of times.  Yes, I am hearing impaired.  The result of growing up in the Seventies with a crappy walkman, earbuds jammed in my ears and Supertramp playing as loud as it would go (before it started distorting), while I scoured the walls of the nearest skatepark or empty backyard pool.  Normal, hearing people don't have a clue what a challenge it is to carry on a normal conversation in a place like this.  It was  a rainy Sunday, and a late lunch with a few beers and friends.  We had hoped to ride our bikes down the canal to this place, and enjoy the afternoon on their patio.  Alas, that was not to be, as mother nature decided to create a downpour that scared the people at O.H.S.O. enough to close the patio.  Everybody inside!  The cacaphony inside was like standing at the base of Niagara Falls and trying to carry on a conversation.  Normal hearing people maybe.  Me, just a painful roar, despite having my hearing aids tuned for the environment.  I had a salad of romaine wedges, one end covered in crumbled blue cheese, bacon bits and some other stuff.  It was actually pretty good.  While eating this salad, I enjoyed an Arizona Trail Ale from That Brewery.  A tasty beer at 6.0%ABV.  Hearty flavor without being overpowering on any notes.  I had a second.  It was good.  This place has a really cool bicycle vibe, all decorated artistically with various parts of and whole bicycles.  They are dog-friendly outside, with free treats made from the spent beer grains for your fidos.  The service is so-so, depending on how busy they are.  Other things on the menu are pretty tasty as well and I've enjoyed the beer brunch on the weekends.  I noticed on Sunday afternoons they are now having a BBQ.  This seems like something I want to try.  When I can sit outside.",

It's the perfect environment to drink a few pitchers of beer and enjoy some of this prime AZ spring weather.  Open to 6pm is Happy Hour, Monday through Friday and there is a plethora of craft beer options for $6 a pitcher.  The pitchers are about the size of (2) Pints of Beer.  Still $3 a pint for craft beer isn't bad at all.  I ordered the AZ Burger. It was good but the Jalapeno Cream Cheese was pretty over powering. It dominated the flavor over all the other condiments.  Some may like that, but for me this made the burger good, not great.  I love the atmosphere at OHSO and the happy hour before 6pm is so prime if you enjoy Local Craft Beer.",

It ruined both our nights because he was up all night sick and me waking up every hour. Its finally out of hit system at 1030 am the next morning. On top of it I just called the place to let them know, I spoke with Nicole and she said she doesn't know what it could have been and thank you for calling. I just can't understand how an establishment in Arcadia that I have gone to time and time again just takes a comment so lightly. From her tone it lacked interest or concern, so doubtful anything will be said. But lost my future business, thanks for lack of caring.",

You really can't go wrong here. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is the service. It can be a little hit or miss at times. The last time we sat at the bar on the patio, we had to wait for the bartender to finish sending a text before she realized we were there and spent a fair amount of time on her phone while we were there.",

Everyone at my table seemed to like the beers that they had. I came with party of 10-12 people and they were able to get us a table. We went on a Tuesday and they had happy hour until 6 p.m. They weren't offering any food specials. But, they had specials on pitchers of beer.   I ordered the fish and chips. It was three huge pieces of Mahi and fries. Delicious, but too much for me to eat. The flatbread pizzas looked delicious. I definitely want to go back again and maybe try one of their flavored beers and a pizza. :)",

    "text": "On my most recent visit to O.H.S.O., they hit the ball out of the park (so to speak) so I have to give them five stars. I decided to check out this place for Sunday brunch and was thrilled with the quality of the food and service, the fun and lively atmosphere, and, of course, the great selection of beer! This is the kind of place you can proudly show off to people from out of town who are just visiting Phoenix.  Every time I try a new place for a late breakfast/brunch on the weekends, I make a point to sample the biscuits and gravy. If the kitchen doesn't have an appreciation for a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs standard like biscuits and gravy, it will be evident. And I was not disappointed in O.H.S.O.'s wonderful take on this breakfast classic... biscuits were fresh and soft, the white sausage gravy was creamy and hearty (with a nice spicy kick). And I was thrilled they offer a half-portion side order for just $4. My buddy and I agreed that the \"Beer Brunch\" was the way to go, and we were super-pleased with our meals. I had the breakfast burrito (the perfect portion size, stuffed with green chile pork carnitas, eggs, cheese, potato) and my buddy had the churrasco steak and egg dish. Both dishes came with a 10-oz. AZ draft beer of our choice for $10, which we agreed was a great value!  I originally tried O.H.S.O. shortly after they took over this location from the Black Forest Mill. I was impressed with the beer selection (especially since they featured a hometown favorite... Rubicon's Monkey Knife Fight from Sacramento), but I was not initially impressed with the food. It has been years since my first visit, and the improvement is palpable. They are brewing their own beer, and I am happy to report that they are firing on all cylinders. The food is great, and the laid-back atmosphere and friendly beer-buzz vibe is undeniable (especially if you check out the back patio). The complimentary valet service may put you off at first, but it is not an attempt at being pretentious. This place is becoming so popular that it is really the best way for them to manage their available space for parking. I was here on a weekend night for a friend's going-away party in the front-most room, and the entire place was frenzied, fun, and just jumpin'! This is now one of my number one fun dining destinations--and a valuable addition to the Phoenix craft beer scene.",

    "text": "We had high hopes for this place, as we live 2 min away from Ohso. We first visited Ohso Saturday 8/10/2013 for brunch. The food was mediocre the side of fruit was rotten, the pie was rubbery and microwaved but the beer was good and the waitress was too. When we told the manager about the fruit...she didn't even offer us a fresh one. We had been told about the Sunday only offering of their supposed famous BBQ all you can eat for $15. By several people, so we decided to give them another chance and go back the next day. Excited to try this offering we invited our family to join us on what we anticipated to be a delightful outing. Not so much ... Not at all. Our plate had more bread than meat, the chicken should have been called a salt lick because that's all that could be tasted. The ribs were ok and the beef brisket was to. By far the best was the brisket. However the meat was not BBQ at all, it was old microwaved meat with salt and some type of \"BBQ'\" sauce. The real issue was the server, a rather rude young lad in need of training in professional etiquette and mannerisms. When I ordered my second serving I expected another plate with the meat that I requested. Hold the chicken and keep the rest. Instead I was brought a little saucer with again more bread topped with a teaspoon of brisket and two emaciated ribs. Hello $15? Where is the food? My mother only ordered more corn bread, she later decided to take it home. When the rude water boy delivered the two take home boxes, he looked at my saucer that had the teaspoon of meat, large loaf of bread and emaciated ribs and said \" oh no that's not how we do this. Its all you can eat while you're here.\" First of all there were 4 yes four people, only 1 person ordered what was supposed to be a second round of \"all you can eat BBQ\" and a bill well over $100.00 so waiter boy gives us attitude over corn bread a and saucer of what was only good for my dog to eat.  Hello! Really, R-U-D-E-!!! We will never go there again and will share with our ENTIRE OFFICE what a waste of time, money and effort \"OHSO Shitty\" really was. If not to be in the company of my parents there would have been quite the conversation with the manager. And just to think that we considered holding our company luncheon at that place. No no no way! Not even if it was for free. Also, who microwaves pie? Oh that would be OHSO. I have never had a rubbery $7 piece of pie.  Thank you for such an unforgettable experience and the loaf of bread.  I give this place -5 star.",

My friend is a major IPA guy so I guess their beer selection wasn't too great. Whatever, I had my normal Guinness with a Jameson back. ;) I ordered the grilled cheese because it sounded too good to pass up. I had them sub bacon for the prosciutto because, well because it's bacon. My friend had a burger which looked uh-mazing. We had to move tables twice because there were so many flies. Finally made it over to a corner away from windows (which you think they might shut due to all the flies!) and that was ok. But when you're in a restaurant looking over a menu, flies swarming around, landing on the table, all over the windows is quite a turn off. No one seemed to care, so I guess I'm crazy. Anyway, the food was good and I'm sure the ambiance and energy is even better in the evening or on the weekends.",

I was worried about a wait but we were seated right away.  Beyond the beer themed decor you would expect of a brewery, they also used old bike  parts, which was fun.  I had the OHSO Breakfast Wrap.  It was not particularly creative with pretty much eggs and bacon in a tortilla but it was tasty and filling.   It could have used more cheese and guacamole.  Could barely taste or see it.  They also forgot my seasonal fresh fruit, which I didn't realize until I saw someone else with a nice bowl of strawberries.  I was almost finished and was full so decided not to mention it.  The hubster got the green Chile pork carnitas.  He got a big plate of food with a nice serving of pork that wasn't too spicy, crispy fried potatoes, beans, scrambled eggs, and tortillas.  I think he won in meal selection.  I got the Grovey, which was a unfiltered wheat with a subtle orange flavor and R got the saison, called Bier du Jour I think.  We also ended our meal with a sampler of their Belgian styles, which was a great deal of 5 decent pours for $5.   The beers were perhaps not epic but tasty.  Good starting place with room to grow.  The service was friendly and attentive.  As others mentioned, plan to valet so bring some tip cash for this free service.   Overall, we would return.  Solid experience.  Laid back and affordable... Not words I would typically associate with what I hear about the Scottsdale dining scene.",

The food was delicious. We had the breakfast flatbread and breakfast burrito. Of the two, the burrito was the best! It's quite possibly the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. An added bonus was how the brunch menu was paired with a beer or mimosa, which reminded me of our European travels like how in Paris our lunch was paired with wine or beer. The best part is that they're dog-friendly complete with a water station!",

We ordered the brew plate and there was a lot to share.  I liked everything, well except the cheese crackers, I don't like crackers that hurt my teeth and are not very flavorful.  Some of the items were ok some were really good.  The brie was legit, creamy creamy, the salami and prosciutto were great, the potato chip gouda was really good, the pita went well with everything, fruit roll up was awesome.  Some of the things on the plate I was a little meh about was the strawberry cream cheese stuff, it tasted great, but like flavored cream cheese I could get from the grocery store, same with the nuts, they didn't do anything to make them special, the eggplant was too sweet.  As far as the beer, 5 stars, the Hubby is an IPA fan so there were three he liked the angry bastard being his favorite and the dragoon being so-so, but not bad.  I sampled the stout, oh it was great!    Our waitress was very nice!",

However, what I really want to review is their event planning. They are the only place in town who would work with me when planning an event for 50-80 people in which they did not require a deposit or that we spend a specific amount per hour, and did not require us to buy off a specific menu. They did separate checks for EVERYONE! The staff was friendly and attentive to work with before and during the event. Their staff followed up with me all the way up until the event. They allowed us to take over a substantial portion of their patio, they were friendly, had staff working specifically with our tables, and had super speedy service. I highly recommend them!!! Our party goers only had glowing reviews!! Based on this experience, I am happy to give them my business and recommend them to everyone!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place because it is an interesting concept but was very under-whelmed by the entire experience.   What I liked:  -  The back patio; it is very nice and comfy and suitable for the heat right now. They have lots of fans and mist. We were there on a Monday around 11 so it was not crowded.  -  The beer selection; lots of variety, both from their own beers and other Arizona/out of state craft beers. The beers were pretty decent and we enjoyed them.    What I didn't care for:  - The food; it was mediocre at best and I cannot believe people find the food here awesome. We had the steak tacos and it doesn't take a genius to realize their tortillas are store bought, the red sauce was bitter and flavourless (gross actually) the slaw was a soggy mess of mayo and no flavor, and the steak was something a high school kid could have made and re-heated. They had advertised you could get Happy Hour Small Food Items all day on Monday, but didn't honor that; those food items would have been suitable to pair with our beers. Everything on the mayo had bacon or cheese in it; due to the variety of the beers, they could have done a better job in pairing the food to the styles of beer.  -  Sample: We had purchased 4 tasters to choose a beer. My husband had already ordered his beer and I was still struggling. The waiter also didn't know much about the beers or what \"dry-hopped\" meant and upon the recommendation of the waiter, I asked for 2 \"samples\" and was charged for tasters. I also do not think the tasters are actually 3 ounces, but I could be wrong. Other places were quite generous and knowledgeable about the beer to help me choose something I would like and to be more adventurous.   Overall, if you want to go somewhere for a nice patio, know which beer you want, and aren't hungry, this is the place to be. I do find it over-hyped and think you might enjoy SanTan (nice patio with mist and fans, good beers and generous samples), Arizona Wilderness (decent patio with a fan, really nice people, good beers, again generous samples and knowledgeable staff), and Huss Brewing (indoors but a very nice and quaint tasting room with really friendly staff and good beers).   We may visit OHSO again for the back patio, but no food and we will insist on a few free samples.",

To be completely honest I am not a huge beer connoisseur, I just really like the atmosphere, the food, and the sprawling back patio.  My co-workers and I used to visit OHSO on Sundays for their $10 \"Beer Brunch\" which includes your choice of 10 oz. beer or large mimosa, plus a selection of ten food options under $10. My favorite items are the green chile pork carnitas (comes served with eggs) and the breakfast flatbread.  As far as appetizers go, I would recommend the spinach artichoke + crab dip or the green chile dip, although last time I had the green chile dip it could have used a tad more salt and spice.   Note-worthy sandwiches include the chicken pesto sammie and the green chile pulled pork (are you seeing a trend here - try the green chile anything, you won't regret it!)   OHSO has a pretty fabulous happy hour that runs Monday through Friday from 11am - 6pm where all wines and pitchers of beer are $6.",

    "text": "We visited OHSO for the first time last night with a good-sized group.  I was so disappointed that we'll never be back.  This is why:  -After being seated, we waited 30 minutes before anyone came to our table.  By the time someone finally did, he asked if he could take our orders.  We looked at each other and said, \"Um, can we see some menus?\"  This gentleman brought us menus and we never saw him again.    -Our actual waitress came to our table about 10 minutes after we were given menus.  After taking our orders, we never saw her again until she brought us our checks (which was maybe just over an hour later).  This means that NOT ONE PERSON IN OUR GROUP EVER RECEIVED A BEVERAGE REFILL.  I suppose this is because nobody ordered alcohol so we weren't \"worth it\" to the waitress.  -The food took for freaking ever to come out.    -The prices were high for the food that was prepared.  I wasn't all that thrilled with my $12 burger.  -We sat on the patio.  The \"shades\" above us did not block out the sun so if one sat in the wrong seat, they fried.  There is some kind of archaic air conditioning system or something that is so incredibly loud that it was all but impossible to carry on a conversation with the person next to me.  The overly-loud music did not help.  -The patio is next to the line outside, meaning we (including my infant and allergic mother) all had to breathe the cigarette smoke of inconsiderate patrons waiting to enter.  Of course, even though they were far less than 20 feet from the entrance (as the law requires) none of the staff bothered asking smokers to obey the law.  WE had to do that.  -Valet parking is mandatory.  It's \"complimentary,\" but there is no such thing as free valet parking.  Since we were not expecting this and we bank out of state (and therefore rarely carry cash) we were required to borrow $2 from a family member to tip the moron who changed my radio settings, moved my seat and messed with my rear-view mirrors.  Really?  -The seats are rather uncomfortable bar stools with no backs and therefore no back support.  Try balancing a little one on one of those babies while eating.  I get it, this isn't really a place for kids, but still... I prefer a back rest on my chair when I pay $12 for my hamburger.  -Since I did not receive a refill on my beverage, I left the restaurant parched.  The waitress was lucky that my husband got his hands on the bill before I did because she was given a tip.  If I had things my way, I would have left very little, if anything... and I'm almost always a large tipper.  :-(  I see no reason to return.",

It is now one of my all time favorite places to go to take a buddy and hang out for a while.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  I love the Arizona Burger! I can eat cream cheese and poblano aoili from the burger with just a spoon!  The brunch specials are amazing as well. Where else can you grab a beer and a tasty filling meal for 10 bucks?  It also helps I can get my favorite beers here- Almost all Four Peaks taps, Papago Brewing Orange Blossom, and Sonoran Brewing White Chocolate Ale! So kudos to you, O.H.S.O! Keep up the great work! I also look forward to your new restaurant.",

    "text": "OHSO has always been the neighborhood hangout I get most excited about-- the amazing beer selection, delicious food, and unbeatable patio atmosphere have always rocketed it to the top of my list. Little did I know a week ago that my love for OHSO could grow even more!  Last week, one of my medical student classmates suggested a class get together at Postino's. Since it was a transitional week in medical school, we all had an very forgiving schedule-- So our dinner group quickly grew to 21. Postino's said there was no way they could seat even 10, nonetheless 21. We panicked and started brainstorming other places that might be able to squeeze us in. I suggested my favorite place, OHSO, and called just a couple of hours before dinner to see if I could make a reservation.   The hostess had no problem taking my reservation. When we arrived, we had a whole room to ourselves, with our own private patio. There were 21 glasses of water waiting for us, and the waiter successfully managed all of our split checks.   I ordered my favorite drink-- St. Louis Framboise, and then tried the Arizona Burger for the first time. I have always heard good things, but have been working my way through OHSO's menu, and just hadn't tried this option yet.   The Arizona Burger was unbelievable. Hands down the best burger I've had in Phoenix. I had always loved OHSO's food, but the Arizona Burger, with it's jalapenos and cream cheese, has taken first place on my list.   Every single person absolutely loved OHSO and I think it became a favorite food/beer destination for all of them!   I was thrilled that such a popular place could be so accommodating and tolerant of large groups. Way to go, OHSO!!",

I've had brunch a few times - all good. Brunch items are $10 and come with a mimosa or local beer, which is the best way cure what ails you!  They also do a Sunday BBQ from 3-7 every week and that is delicious! Its $15 and you get 3 meats (mix and match, chicken quarter, pork ribs and brisket), coleslaw, potato salad and 2 pcs cornbread. Its awesome!  OHSO's late night menu is pretty good too with simple bar foods that satisfy those drunk hunger cravings.  Oh, and my review wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention that their bloody mary is one of my faves.  Can you guys please offer that with your brunch??  Brunch n bloody? I'll pay a couple bucks upcharge... Please?",

Was nice once we found a spot that isn't in wind tunnel conditions.  Got two pitchers of Orange blossom beer.... both were room temperature..in the summer in Arizona?. hmmm.  The waitress wasn't all that distressed about it ... only offered to bring us a couple of chilled glasses as a remedy... really? We ended up putting ice in our glasses of beer. The pitcher of a different beer was ice cold.  We split a burger and fries.  It was hot and delicious.  Kudos.  Driving by this place is always crowded.... so they must be doing something right.  Just... not when I'm there.  It has always needed more consistency in service and food/drink quality... so I always feel like my money will for sure be going out... but what I may or may not get might be great or just so so.   That's why it has remained on my once or twice a year stop by place... and not a regular haunt.  It needs that polish that the Fox concept restaurants seem to have down to a science.",

They have a changing beer menu and carry not only their own, but plenty of beers from other local breweries and some from not-so-local, like Japan!

But holy water dishes and panters galore!  They even have a recurring dog photo contest.   Now.  The beer?  Amazing selection and the happy hour pitcher special is nuts.  I love their HH food specials as well.  The pretzel with cheese?  Pretty sure I requested a straw and drank the rest of the cheese up.  I called it Cheese Soup to make it slightly more respectable.  I guess that's just what happens when you are \"forced\" to drink a pitcher of great craft beer!  The brunch special is pretty good, but on my most recent visit I ordered the grilled cheese and was fairly disappointed at my meal compared to everything else I saw....pretty paltry portion IMO.  I would've rather had a more respectable/substantial  sandwich and had no fruit and random sauce/dip.  The late night eats menu is a great addition of greasy yet delicious food at pretty awesome prices.  Service has always been another high point for OHSO.  But the bathrooms, UGH!.......I guess all those pitchers of cheap beers makes for some nasty drunk bitches, because my late night visits have always resulted in straight up DISGUSTING women's bathroom conditions. LADIES, GET IT TOGETHER AND STOP VOMITING IN PUBLIC.  WTF.  Only other negative is the parking situation.  I just hate valet.  Even if it's free.  HATE IT.  If you time it right, you may get lucky, but even when meeting friends at say, 4pm or so, I still get stuck valeting. But hey, this place is packed, for good reason.   I'll be back!",

Considering the price they charge for their dish, this was very disappointing, maybe this place is good for a simple breakfast or beers but for dinner, save your money and go somewhere that creates a dish worthy of the money.",

You can even brew your own beer and pick a name for it with their on-staff beer geniuses. The happy hour prices are awesome - you can get a pitcher or a pint and I think during happy hour the pitchers are only a dollar more than a pint. So that's a tough decision ha ha!  Next, this place is dog friendly on the patio. So bring your pup and some friends next time. They have a dog wash station and a little dog bowl bar to keep your canine buddy hydrated. They even bake homemade dog treats from leftover grain from the beer making process.  They also have beer events and smoke meats on the patio for barbecues. If any of this sounds appetizing to you, plan a happy hour with your friends at OSHO! You won't regret it.  P.S. the patio gets pretty full, but I believe they take reservations, so give them a call to find out, if you plan to bring a large party.",

I parked my car on a residential street directly across from the restaurant (warning: jaywalking six road lanes or walking around to the stoplight is included in the task of parking in the residential area).  Outside the restaurant absolutely does not live up to the expectations once stepping inside.  Walking through the door immediately changed the mood.  I walked in wearing my white sundress with a smile on my face.  O.H.S.O.'s bright environment is prefect for the Arizona sun.  The restaurant is quite large (it probably wouldn't have been a bad idea to save some space for parking).  The back patio is gorgeous; it was no surprise to see 90% of happy customers in the back.  And yes, it's a dog friendly place with dog treats too (noted if/when I have a dog).  O.H.S.O. serves brunch, lunch, dinner as well as a few desserts with assorted drinks including wine, cocktails, whiskey, tequila, vodka, and of course, beer.  For my first experience, I enjoyed brunch with my date.  $10 for one brunch meal and 10oz beer or mimosa is a pretty sweet deal, in my opinion.  I completely finished my Carnitas Bowl and mimosa; obviously, it was too delicious for me to leave leftovers.  Also, I must add that one mimosa is plentiful poured in a wine glass, versus in a skinny, tall champagne glass.  O.H.S.O. made my list of places worth coming back to for another good time.",

    "text": "We sat on the patio on a Friday night around 845pm. The wait time when we arrived was around 45 minutes but we got a table in about 30-40 minutes. The patio was packed with two-legged and four-legged friends alike. Probably one dog for every two people. There were one or two troublemaker pooches that strolled through, but for the most part, all of the furry friends were on their best behavior, chilling under the tables waiting for scraps to fall their way. If you like the company of dogs, you will enjoy the patio here. (I can't comment on the interior as we were outside the whole time)  I don't live in Phoenix and my friend who does says it was rare, but there was a ton of wind on this particular evening and the back patio is next to a dusty trail, so there was quite a bit of dirt flying around during our stay. It wasn't too bad but it was annoying at times. I'll chalk it up to a rare occasion.   I ordered the seared Ahi salad. Four large pieces of tuna all tasted very fresh. A lot of times when I get an ahi salad I am disappointed in the amount of fish but I was pretty pleased with these slices. Just the right ratio of greens to fish. The dressing was sweet but not heavy. The red peppers and dried cherries were a nice complement as well. But beware, it does have a kick. I like my spice more medium than anything, and though I wasn't expecting much spiciness in this salad, it did have more than I anticipated. It wasn't unbearable, but just know that it is pretty spicy. A beer and a glass of water will wash it down just fine.   Speaking of beer, they have a solid selection of beers you won't find everywhere. I got a hef for #1 but can't remember my second. I did taste the orange blossom beer and glad I didn't order a full pint. It was basically an orange creamsicle with a touch of alcohol. My friend got a pineapple beer but couldn't finish it due to its sweetness. The beer selection isn't massive, but there's something for everyone with different tastes.   My friends got pork tacos and the BBQ burger and both recommended those as well.   You will have to valet here as parking is pretty scarce, but pretty sure it was free with a receipt. We got out quickly since it had died down considerably by 11pm.",

    "text": "Came here for backyard bbq on Sunday night . I really wanted to like this place and the food was pretty good but I came here at 430 and and decided to have their Sunday night barbecue special. The special came with corn bread, chicken, ribs, brisket, coleslaw, and potato salad. When I finally got my food I didn't get any corn bread because supposedly they had run out but I was never told that they were out of corn bread. After I finish my first plate I order my second plate, which was then brought with no chicken, no coleslaw, and again no cornbread. When I asked the waiter about all of the missing food items he told me that they ran out of everything 2 hours before their special ended. When we got our bill they still charged me full price for everything, even though I didn't get what I ordered. Definitely disappointed :(",

    "text": "I've been frequenting here more frequently than I care to admit for about three years. Their pitchers (smaller than many pitchers, at a little over two pints), their extensive beer list, and their killer patio view of Camelback Mountain make them the best spot I know of in the Valley to kick back and drink a good craft brew. The $10 beer/mimosa-and-brunch special on Saturdays and Sundays is unbeatable too.  Only downsides: hard to get a seat sometimes, especially during the brunch rush. Food is hit-or-miss with so-so value; the Arizona Burger is definitely my go-to order. Their beer list changes constantly and, though I like probably two-thirds of what I order, sometimes I'll get tripped up on a funky-flavored brew (I'd steer clear of most of the ones with \"chocolate\" or \"espresso\" in the name, but maybe that's just me). But I'll gladly take that sort of variation in quality in exchange for such a wide selection, great beer prices, and all-around original concept.  Keep up the good work, OHSO!",

They have select entres that come with a free 10 OZ. Beer or a mimosa. Which made the brunch deal even better. One complaint the chicken was a bit too dry for our taste. Maybe they left it in the fryer too long, other than that had a great time. The server recommended my beer and he did a great choice. \"The Lost Viking\" beer is the way to go!",

    "text": "I live nearby and kept meaning to pop-in. When I finally did I wanted to smack myself for waiting so long. Relaxed vibe no matter the time of day you come. (Fair warning: If you come alone during happy hour the pick-up lines will make you laugh.)  You can't beat their happy hour AND the diversity of brews offered is killer. The bar area up front has an assortment of seating styles. Couches, booths and standing tables are mixed together which lends itself to conversation. The inside restaurant seems family friendly enough, but I've not sat there.   But what I love, love, love is the back patio! There are booths, which are perfect for dates and groups, along the back. (We comfortably sat a group of five.) The bar is super neat as you're not just facing the bartenders. If you wanted to this is a spot to readily start a new conversation.  Oh, but the food. I just enjoyed my burrito as a leftover for breakfast. Sunday they offer $10 meals with a 10 oz beer (or mimosa). There was a long list to choose from. I couldn't pick as there were waaay too many delightful things to pick from. Our super awesome server helped me triage and I ended up with a burrito that came with strawberries. YUM. Seriously. This morning I was too lazy to warm it up. Awesome. I've also enjoyed a flatbread BBQ chicken pizza - messy - but good stuff.  I absolutely adore that this place carries a porter beer. (Even though we're in oven hot summer.) Thank you O.H.S.O.!  Last thing - and this totally made me laugh yesterday. The valets were totally serious. I rode up in my bike and they would have valet'd my bicycle for me. \"If I asked nice.\" These guys are always super nice when I drop off a car. I love them. Well, I love everyone on the staff too. Which is why coming here is such a nice experience.",

The place itself is a good size on the inside and has a back patio that seems to be a big hit with the locals.  We had just visited an outdoor Oktoberfest event and decided to enjoy the A/C instead.  The bike theme of the decor can be seen throughout the restaurant and it's a fun and whimsical idea incorporating a close by bike trail.  The menu has a variety of options from flatbreads to burgers.  I had the BBQ bacon burger and he had the pulled pork sandwich.  Both were prepared well and tasted good!  Our friend had one of the flatbread (I don't remember the exact one - my apologies) but I remember he said it was very good.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful throughout the meal and had a great sense of humor.    Overall: A We will be back to enjoy that patio!",

    "text": "I want to like it.  I really do.  They have an amazing back patio and carry Tito's vodka (which is super delicious if you haven't tried it).  But every time I've gone, something has disappointed me.   First off, service is nothing to write home about.  The first time we were here, we grabbed a table in the bar and were told we'd have to check in with the hostess for that table.  We checked in with her and were told it would be about 15-20 minutes.  We headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited.  After we got our drinks, the hostess found us and said our table was ready.  Guess what table it was.  That was a big WTH.  Our server had to be flagged down by us when we wanted to order another drink or food.  He was ok with visiting all of his other tables around us though.  The next 2 times I've been here, the service was better, but terribly slow. Next up is the beer.  It is tasty.  I don't drink beer, but my friends let me try the ones they ordered.  I know that beer is best cold.  I imagine how much more these tasty beers would be if they were weren't warm.  It is a nanoBrewery for goodness sake.  Keep your main product cold! Finally, the food.  I'm just going to talk about one instance.  Brunch.  We ordered a breakfast flatbread that called for an over-medium egg to be on top.  The egg was completely cooked.  The yolk was solid which I find disgusting in a fried egg.  The point of an over-medium egg being on top of a pizza is so the runny yolk gets all over it.  And it's amazing when done right.  If the yolk isn't going to be runny, then scramble the darn things so it can be easily spread across the pizza.  The cost of the flatbread did include choice of beer or mimosa, so that helped the cause. Will I return here?  I'm sure my friends will want to have drinks on the patio and I will go with them.  Will I ever suggest to go here?  No way.",

    "text": "I went there last week with my three year old daughter to meet a friend of mine and his seven year old son. There was complimentary valet parking outside which was awesome and helpful since the place was pretty busy for a random Wednesday night. The very first thing I noticed when I walked in was that people were happy. I'm not just talking about the patrons, either. Everyone from the hostess to servers to bartenders looked to be relaxed and smiling and genuinely happy to be there.     My friend was already there so when the hostess showed us to our table, there was no wait for service. In fact, the server was already there having a nice chat with him. She helped me choose a beer from the extensive beer list (orange pale ale) and asked my kid directly what she wanted to drink while looking to me for a nod of approval. This is another plus in my book. I appreciate when people treat my kid like a human and not just an accessory I brought to the restaurant.     We started with the green chile dip which was served with yucca chips and their house made flatbread. This was delicious. I mean, we ate the whole thing. The kids even got in on it and LIKED it. A+ for this menu item.     The menu here has a great feel to it. Health conscious with a nod to fresh, seasonal, and local selections but also some classic brewery-style options. There is truly something here for every palate.  I was stuck between the Mahi Mahi Tacos and the Burger + Cheese. I had tacos elsewhere the night before so I chose the burger. He got the AZ Burger. The choices are pink and not pink which I thought was pretty cool.  Both burgers were delicious. I was only able to eat about half but I was happy to be able to take this home to finish later.      The kids' menu was pretty cool, as well. Not everything is fried. Fruit is an option. Not just any fruit but berries. So, my kid had some macaroni and cheese in a reasonable portion size with a side of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries. Oh, and they use these berries to make fresh fruit roll ups. Happiness through the roof.    We finished up and I got a tour of the restaurant. The place looks great. Front and back patio that are dog friendly (even have dog water bowls). The back patio definitely reminded me of some springtime day drinking ventures at Dos over the years. The interior has a nice comfy, classy, vintage-but-not-overly-so feel to it. The brewing process is outlined in a great hand-drawn, chalk display.    I really liked that the staff here doesn't wear uniforms. They aren't advertising events or happy hours or pushing menu items. Their work ethic and customer service is what OHSO chose to display and it shows. They were happy, comfortable and pretty at-home in their work environment. Kudos to whoever does the hiring at this place.    Overall, this was a great place to visit and I will definitely be back and recommending it to friends. Nice job, OHSO!",

The beer is amazing and so is the food. The owner is from Traverse City, MI which is a plus for us since that's were we are from!! Its always busy here so be warned! Especially Sunday mornings for brunch!! One thing that I don't care for is Valet parking. I can park my own car! You have to tip those guys too which just makes things annoying. I just want to park and not worry about it, but since it does get so busy there I understand why they do it. I just don't like it.",

But I've been to Ohso dozens of times and their food is simply not good. I cannot go to Ohso hungry anymore... Sure I could drink more beer but It shouldn't be that hard to have something appetizing aside from the Ohso Green Chile dip!  Especially as a beer guy, I hate to write this but don't go to Ohso if you want to eat even decent food. Nothing on the menu is worth eating.",

    "text": "I really really really like OHSO.  I always feel a little odd reviewing a brewery since I don't drink beer, so I'll review the eatery part.  But let me say if I did like beer, I would love that you can buy small tastings before you commit.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to do that with anything?    First off, the menu is perfect with a handful of appetizers, small plates, salads, burgers, and sandwiches all for $10-$15.  The small plates are really not that small.  The shrimp tacos were really good as was the accompanying slaw.  The tortillas are street size, but you get a good half dozen or so.    I really loved the grilled chicken flatbread with plenty of cheese, bacon, garlic poblano sauce, and a cilantro pesto.  If you're not a fan of cilantro, it is almost undetectable.  I also wish the poblano sauce were a little spicier.  But what makes this flatbread is the chopped tomato and cucumber salad on top.  It adds a nice sweetness and freshness to the pie.  Without it, the dish would fall a little flat to me.  And whatever you get, add french fries.  Thin and crispy with a sprinkling of black pepper.  Mmm.  Mmm.  It's never been busy on my visits, but I've only gone for weekend lunches.  Hopefully they stick around for a while.",

    "text": "OHSO is one of those places that I wish was more prevalent in big beer cities- completely dedicated to local tap only beer with a great, relaxed ambiance and good food to boot. Really fun atmosphere which I will assume was a commandeered out of business Joe's Crab Shack complete with massive sports bar patio and circular wood bar. Interior has a full restaurant seating, and an exposed-to-the-elements active nanobrewery. Service was quick, knowledgeable, friendly. Beer selection was large with a focus on local breweries. Half the tap list was Arizona beers, which was incredible. High-quality offerings overall. My only disappointment was that their own beers made in house were not so great. They allow amateurs to brew on their system and make god knows what. But then, they sell the beer to the public. That is a bold move in my opinion as you are 99% guaranteed the beer will be awful. Didn't eat here, but menu looked nice.",

    "text": "Well, alright then. Another sweet spot to hang out on a lively evening.   Let's be clear from the start though...this place is loud, VERY loud if you happen to be sitting in the bar area. It could have been the obnoxious 22 year olds sitting behind us, but I practically had to yell at each other across our table. The other problem? The service was slow. Our server was incredibly friendly and down to earth, but it took us forever to get our bill at the end of the night. I get it, it's a bar-type hangout and business is booming, but it was disappointing to wait so long after an otherwise pleasant experience.   So on to the good points... The atmosphere is pretty cool (the back patio looks awesome, but was too crowded on this particular night) and the seating was trendy, but comfy. The husband ordered the veggie flat which he really enjoyed (he wished he would have ordered it without the broccoli though) and I ordered the pesto chicken sammie. My sandwich was so good. Like really good. And the fries were perfectly crispy without being overdone. I'm one of those people who gets easily sick of my meal even before I'm full. This was not one of those situations. Even my husband commented on how quickly I put that bad boy down. So good!  And I won't forget to mention the awesome beer selection. They really have something for everyone. Ciders, wheats, darks, pales...everything. And don't forget the wine and cocktail list. Don't mind if I do!  So yeah, this place is pretty great. There are definitely some kinks that need to be worked out so I hope they are still trying to improve. Keep it up. It's hard to find a great bar-type hangout with such tasty meal options. I'll be back!  P.S. Anyone know what O.H.S.O. stands for anyway? Am I missing out on some inside joke?",

Once we sat down, looked over the menu, I was feeling uninterested, so we started with mimosa and the Butchers Board. I thought it was a little weird that for 18.00 we got 2 pieces of bread the side of a silver dollar, cheese, brie, salami and CORNNUTS-  I thought after getting this appetizer - something is missing- but no that was it, I wish I took a picture, but to say the least we were very unimpressed with what we had-  we never made it to the actual meal. It was just a bit overload on the loudness-   Though there was a football game going on and the crowd was enjoying it. 2 drinks ( one refunded) and corn nuts -   35. 00   not really worth it.  I could have gone to Circle K and got those same nuts for a buck and enjoyed them just the same.   This is a place you go to and hang out with your friends, however it is loud so you won't really hear them.",

Our waitress was very helpful, pointing out what was on special and informing us of the price savings to order pitchers instead of pints. The Happy Hour prices for the beers is insane for the quality of the beers you get, sadly no food discounts this night, but can't complain over that.  Food tasted great and was exactly as ordered. We finished that along with our pitchers of beer and she was right on top of anything we needed. Gave one of us a sample of the beer to make sure it's what he wanted before ordering the pitcher.   During our time we talked to her about the dog friendly nature of the back patio and how the high benches have individual dog tie ups and water dishes. She informed us that they also have free dog treats for dogs made on the premises.   Been here before and will definitely come here again, especially for the great happy hour!  If crowded the parking lot can get full quick and you then either have to rely on valet or park across the street somewhere and walk over. Small price to pay.",

He personally invited me to come back and give OHSO a try again.   So, I pulled together a happy hour with about 7 of my beer drinking buddies and off we went.   The good: The service was better and our orders were all correct.   +1 star from my last review. The \"eh\":  I just do not understand why the service is so slow here.  We came early (4:30) and stayed until about 7:00 or so on a Friday evening.  It was actually pretty slow at first, then definitely more hopping, but not jam packed.  It took forever to get beers and half the time the beers were warm when they got to us??   Weird.      I appreciated the conversation with the manager, who also introduced himself in person when we returned.   He's definitely making an effort and it sounds like they are interested in being a hangout for locals, which is cool.   As I said before, I think the concept of OHSO is great, the beers are amazing, the food is delicious...   it's my hope that the service will continue to improve.   If it does, this could definitely become a favorite hang-out.",

I'd only heard good things about it and they are True.      They have a wonderful selection of beer and a very interesting menu. Since we made it for brunch we went with it. We started with the Crab Dip. The only place I've been to that brought out enough chips for the dip. It was delicious. I could have eaten 2 serving myself and readily regretted it. It is very salty. But very good if you can handle it.      We both went with the Carnitas and Egg bowl with the not so Crispy Fires. I usually only like Teriyaki Bowls. The mixture of some many other ingredients is usually a turn off. This in turn was very good.I got the pico on the side, so it wouldn't make the fries soggy. No worries, the Carnitas had so much liquid that the pico wouldn't have mattered. Yes the Carnitas were very good with green chilli's mixed into it but my fries were completely soggy. It's also high in Salt/Sodium.       With the wonderful variety I'm sure there are other dishes with a healthier sodium content. We just picked the 2 items that we could feel had an immediate effect on both of our blood pressures before we were gone 15 minutes. Burger on the next visit.      You'll love the beer menu. Lot's of different offerings for your palate. Even an 11%er on the menu.      Being my Birthday we had the Strawberry/Rhubarb Pie. It was wonderful. Fresh, flavorful and sweet to make my birthday special.       I will be back here. So many healthier things to try along with the beer. And if nothing sounds good on the menu when I get there, I will still be eating the Pie.",

It was a pretty large portion, but quite delicious.   Will definitely return when I'm back in the area!",

There's isn't really much else needed, but they've also got a great patio, bar and dining room. Parking kind of sucks, but I guess no one is perfect. One star off because they had a couple of beers listed on the menu that they were waiting to tap, which was pretty irritating, since most of the people at our table wanted them.   They make dog biscuits for you to take for free!",

The back patio is a doggie heaven, with hooks to tie up your pooch at each table, water bowls, free treats, and lots of doggie friends for your dog to bark at and annoyingly try to play with as you try to eat your meal in peace :P  I really love the brunch here!  They have quite a variety of brunch dishes, like biscuits and gravy, waffle + bacon, brat sausage breakfast, veggie omelette flatbread, and more!  And all their brunch specials are only $10, which includes a beer/mimosa.  That's a pretty fantastic deal.  I ordered the waffle and bacon, which I thought was really delicious.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but it hit the spot.  This might become my new favorite brunch place.",

I'd have to say that the portions were small, compared to the typical-American-serving.. which is nice, but not so good when you are famished (which we all were, in anticipation for 'dinner out' in Arcadia).  My Ahi portion was quite small (I'm pretty sure less than 4oz) but the salad and the dressing combination were an explosion of pure delight in my mouth.. tart cherries, crispy yucca and bitter arugula topped with soy ginger vinaigrette was such a delight!  My sister's also boasted about the flavor of their meal.  Truly tasty food.  The ambiance was pretty quiet, but then again it was Monday night.. and the lighting was a bit awkward where we were seated at.. I had this shining halogen bulb right in my direction and it was awkward.  Our server gal was nominal, friendly, but short with convo.  I wanted a Belgian beer, but they were out, so I nixed the beer idea (I know, I'm a turd, I should've just had some)  and got a Spanish Garnacha which was delicious.  My sisters enjoyed their sip of it.  I'll definitely be coming back for some more tasty food :)",

    "text": "I ride by this place a lot commuting via bike. Stopped in a few times, and it's a fairly decent establishment that isn't overly hipsterish, but does have some issues.  Food is solid from what I've had. Brisket sandwich is great, but be sure to order with the cheese on the side since that's blasphemous. We've had a few other burgers and sandwiches, all have been pretty good.   Beer, meh. This cancer of mediocre AZ \"craft\" beers is taking over every bar with potential in Phoenix has got to stop. Local is only good is the local stuff is actually good (like in California, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri or even Utah!). OHSO's list is very heavy with this hip, local AZ crap, only redeemed by the fact they are $6 for a quart pitcher during happy hour. Awesome! But if you put a gun to my head, I couldn't tell you one local beer on their list, they are that grossly forgettable and excruciatingly boring. They do have some better out-of-state craft beers on the list, but those aren't privy to the happy hour pricing.   Their house cocktails are outstanding. My girlfriend has ordered a few, and they always deliver. Good stuff.  Service is hit or miss. Not the most attentive staff, but it could be worse. Last time we sat on the patio, there was no patio bartender at all during happy hour. A server was running orders and drinks from the inside bar. Very odd and a one time gaff, but we usually have a decent bartender and food comes out quickly.  Dogs; I love my dogs, but I'm not necessarily a fan of yours, or of entitled, dipshit, narcissistic  dog owners. Don't drop anything on a table and eat it here. I've seen several small rats/dogs standing on the bar top with their gross paws, or sitting and licking their crotches. Also nice to see larger dogs seated at tables, slobbering on the table and bench seat. But in a world where people think it's OK to bring \"therapy\" turkeys, ponies and snakes on airplanes, why am I not surprised to see dogs bellying up to the bar?  Valet parking. HUGE turnoff, but I think this is the status quo after 4PM or so. Never had an issue parking in the back lot when this was the German restaurant (Black Forest?), but I'm seeing this compulsory valet thing show up and more and more \"hip\" bars around town. No bueno. However, you can avoid damage to your car by simply parking at Safeway, or riding a bike.   Nevertheless, OHSO is certainly worth a checking out, especially if you like to bike the canal trail.",

The combination works so well, and OSHO definitely know how to pull it off. I recommend sitting outside if it's nice out and you like dogs.

Today I had the Popcycle Blonde Ale which has a light raspberry lemon background flavor. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  They have a great menu to choose from and on Sunday's, after 3:00, they have a barbecue plate with pork ribs, chicken and brisket accompanied with cornbread, potato salad and coleslaw. It's an all you can eat for $18. Very tasty, but make sure you have an empty stomach before. Lol The atmosphere is very laid back and comfortable. Good music, comfy seats, lots of room for larger parties, and a great back patio. Sunday's are 'bring your dog day' on the patio.  They even offer free homemade dog cookies. Way to go!

It's definitely a prime Arcadia location since it's next to the bike path/canal.   I arrived early for a happy hour for a decently-sized group of 15-20 people. We didn't have a reservation, but since I did arrive early and it wasn't terribly busy, the OHSOers were able to push together a bunch of tables for my group to sit altogether. Our server quickly greeted me upon sitting down and got a bunch of waters to the tables since it was one of our \"nice\" hot summer days. On the beer list there was a lot of new stuff on both the OHSO side and the local side.   I decided to try one of their cocktails instead [the Herban Woman] of beer [gasp], but one of my friends let me try his IPA. Glad I went with the Herban Woman, it's a sweet sipping summer-y drink. Not too strong and not too sweet. I noshed on really great fries that he ordered as well and didn't want. Perfect compliment to my beverage.   Happy hour at OHSO is amazing. $7 cocktails and pitchers! Beer pints are normally $6 so you're basically getting 1.5 more pints for just $1 more. There are discounts on food as well, but I didn't take a peek at the offerings. Will definitely have to come back soon for another happy hour!",

    "text": "Went to meet a friend i havent seen in 4 years visiting from out of town. Grabbed a beer from bar and chilled outside for a while. Went in to cool off and get a bite to eat. We stood up at hostess stand for a minute, and no one seemed to be at the front. We walked through the bar area and sat at a booth by a server station. Server comes over in an obviously shitty mood and gives us some menus. Her demeanor was so uncomfortable. It wasnt even late (830-9pm) and she was probably the closing server. I had opened a tab with the bartender earlier but I was going to order another beer and told the server that my card was at the bar. She cut me off before i finished my sentence and very rudely exclaimed \"Uhhh then you need to close your tab with the bartender\". I think it pissed her off that I ordered a water from her... Whatever. Well, ok then, miss bad attitude, guess who is obviously not getting a dime for a tip and a bad review for your terrible excuse for service. A very polite BOH guy even delivered our food and I said thank you every time anyone came to our table, INCLUDING grumpy girl. So I was TRYING to help her not hate us so much. It is so much easier to be nice than mean. She was even slamming stuff around on the server station right behind us, like putting away menus or something. LOL. Wow.  Point is, if your table has a tab at the bar, most restaurants can transfer the tab to the server. And then the server has to tip the bar a certain percent based on alcohol sales anyway. I was a server for 8 years in fine dining/bar/sports bar atmospheres so excuse me if my expectations are a little high. Sorry not sorry.  Rest of the employees seemed nice and the place was clean. Menu looked good. I had shrimp tacos. Shrimp was cooked perfectly and we had spinach artichoke dip for app. It was sweet which was weird but was ok. Hate to write a bad review, but no excuse for server attitude. Leave that at the door.",

Dogs are welcome on the patio, and they even provide little water dishes for your furry friends. There's a bike entrance from the crosscut canal, so people can walk or bike in on the canal path and enter from the back.   Service is exceptionally friendly, and there is a great brunch deal (buy a $10-15 entree and get a local beer to go with it). The beer is really great as well. On the downside, the food isn't super exciting. I've had the veggie burger and avo toast, neither of which were bad but just not mind blowing. In general, the food is typical bar fare.   Come for the atmosphere and beer, and have a great time on the patio!",

We had a party of eight on a Sunday afternoon.  Waiter Humberto took 10+ minutes to acknowledge us.  Then another 20-25 minutes to take orders.  Actually, that was another waiter to take orders because he was nowhere to be found.  Getting water refills was a non-starter, despite our esteemed waiter walking by with a pitcher numerous times.  Perhaps if we were blonde and had aftermarket breasts, we could have had waters refilled.   Compounding the lousy service was a group of loud, drunken sorority skanks that mysteriously continued to be served despite state regulations.  Hello, ASLB!  Asked for a second beer...three times.  Never got it.  We got the bum's rush because our waiter was coming off shift.  God forbid the customer be right, ever.  Perhaps his don't give a ---- attitude would be better suited for the overnight shift at a Waffle House.  Guess I won't be back for that second beer.  If you go, do be careful of this obnoxious roll in the vinyl flooring.",

The patio was full of dogs of all sizes that my party and I could barely keep up conversation as we just watched the pups around us.  (**If you're not a dog lover but still like a good beer brunch - inside is good too!)  Beer brunch - while I wish there were more non-sweet food options, the plentiful beer options made up for everything! I couldn't decide between all the different options, but our waiter was very helpful in providing samples/suggestions!  *chicken and waffles - this seemed to be the crowd favorite and the most bang for your buck! I tried some of my friends' and I thought it was better than my breakfast bowl  *fruity pebble french toast - this was really aesthetically pleasing if that helps anyone  *avocado toast - 2 friends got this and they seemed to really like it!  The star of the show (other than the pups though) were still the beer. If you like good beer and good deals, OHSO is an incredible and unique environment to enjoy those!",

I got a mimosa with my breakfast wrap and it was huge! Definitely a good balance between champagne and orange juice. The breakfast wrap wasn't \"wimpy\", as described by the waiter, but it wasn't huge either. It was more like a someone who skipped leg day. The wrap was delicious and my friend really enjoyed the avocado toast. We also got the donut holes to start and those were so tasty! The chicken and waffles are pretty humongous so that may be the next item to try, followed by the biscuits with gravy. Overall the food is delicious and I cannot wait to go back and try more. I want to eat out on the patio too as it looks pretty cool out there.  Be prepared to valet your car because the lot here is TINY. You pull in and there really is no place to go but straight to valet. Some people may be annoyed about this, but it's nice that I don't have to worry about where to park and such. I cannot wait to go back for my next visit!",

The food has been pretty good so far; no complaints. You get a free beer or mimosa with a brunch item, so that's definitely a WIN!   A few servers look a bit unhappy to be there and lack a sense of urgency, so that would be my mild qualm with this place. The VALET staff is phenomenal however!",

And if you don't like the beer selection, in about three weeks the entire in-house list turns over. That means you can get a wholly unique beer flight each visit.  But saying OHSO is only about beer sells it short. It has THE BEST BLOODY MARY in Arizona. Notably, it comes with house-made beef jerky along with the normal toppings. The jerky is so good. They've also begun distilling their own liquor and they have crafted a delicious gin.  The food is tasty but wildly overpriced. The location is just off the canal and has a bike bar (i.e., tools you can use to tune up your bike), a gorgeous outside patio and bar, games to help you bide your time, is dog-friendly, and even gives away free dog biscuits to those canine owners out there. What more could you want?",

There's plenty of table and booth seats, but if those don't suit your fancy, you can also take a seat at the bar or the outdoor patio area. We came here for dinner/drinks on a Sunday night, and the Cardinals/Seahawks game was on. (You know, the embarrassing one where both sides messed up their field goals and the chance to score a win in OT? Yeah, you know the one.)  O.H.S.O. has an awesome selection of beer that will suit your tastes. I don't remember exactly which beer I ordered, but it was something white chocolate-y and delicious.  For food, I've always been a mac and cheese kind of girl. O.H.S.O. did me a solid and offered mac and cheese with brisket and I was. so. there. It came out just as I expected -- tender brisket slathered in sweet BBQ sauce lying on top of some ooey, gooey mac and cheese. I still drool when I think about it...  Sadly, I'm not a Phoenix native, but if I were, you can bet that I would have brought my pup to this place. There was a golden retriever hanging out in the patio area when we were there, and I couldn't stop staring at its fluffy adorableness. I absolutely love how dog-friendly O.H.S.O. is. I took a pack of treats on my way out and offered them to my dog when I got home. She gobbled all of them up and couldn't get enough. Thanks, O.H.S.O.!",

    "text": "Picked up my buddy from the airport, and on the way home, we stopped here.  He's a big beer fan, and I had seen that they have a late night happy hour.    I went with a pretzel, and their crab wontons.  Each item was $3.00, and even for that, I thought it was just a tad skimp (mainly the wontons).  The pretzel was hot and salted nicely.  The cheese dip they serve this thing in, was great!  It had a good texture to it, and some jalapenos/peppers mixed in with the nacho cheese.  Tasty, but the pretzel was small, so you couldn't even dip it enough times to use up all the cheese.  Oh well.  On to the wontons........for $3.00, you get 3 of these things and they were sitting in a sweet sriracha/chili type sauce (really tasty and good spice!).  These things were definitely skimp.  The filling was minuscule.  It was basically like eating plain fried wonton wrappers.  Couldn't even decipher that it was crab inside of the wontons.  Honestly, I have never seen a skimper wonton/dumpling/egg roll type food item in my life.  Definitely would not get those again.  My buddy had a couple of beers and thought they were ok.  Since it was Pi Day, they had some unique brews on tap and I tried a couple of my buddies samplers (lemon meringue pie, blueberry pie and a bourbon pecan pie).  The lemon meringue pie taste exactly like a lemon meringue pie.  They definitely hit the spot as far as flavor profile.    Service was friendly.  We had a few different servers/helpers/managers come by and everyone was awesome!  3 stars for the cool vibe, the service and some decent beers.  Wouldn't come back here for the food, but it is definitely a chill place I can see myself returning to with out of town company for a couple of beers on the patio.",

After 4-5 bites I was full. My husband ordered the AZ burger. Again, it was okay...not great.   $72 for 1 beer, 1 soda, an app and two mediocre meals just felt like a lot. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? Not sure we'd recommend it again.",

The beer menu left a bad taste in my mouth because one of the featured brews was called \"Nerve Agent.\" I find this name in extremely bad taste.

I like the Dollar per Pour method of creating your own flights. Nicely priced. Tried three that I wouldn't normally have gone for.

He was helpful, accommodating, and made paying so easy (when it's usually a nightmare in big groups!). Thank you, thank you!  OHSO is a neighborhood classic, you really can't go wrong. Fun patio with adorable doggies, bike racks for the \"winter\" (aka anytime that isn't 120 degrees), local friendly feel. You really can't beat the $10 brunch special - any food item from a selected variety... go with the breakfast wrap and ask for salsa and pico on the side ;)... and a beer or mimosa for just ten bucks! When I'm there for lunch or dinner, the fish tacos, tomato soup, and sweet potato fries are my go-to items. Keep it up OHSO!!",

To get protein on a salad is going to cost well over $15 and it is not close to the quality of an LGO or Flower Child salad. Tacos were super bland and boring. Food quality and taste needs to improve drastically.",

The atmosphere is top notch. It feels very welcoming and friendly. The decor matches. The inside feels very industrial, while also maintaining character. The outside, particularly the patio in the back, feels open and inviting (even for pets).  The food is also pretty good. I had the grilled chicken and a massive burger at this place and both were very good. I have no complaints from the food I tried. The portions were also very much welcomed. I felt satisfied each time.  The drinks are also interesting. I'm not a beer drinker, so I won't comment on that, but the cocktails are really fun to dive into. There are ones with funny names and different tastes. I am not an experienced drinker by any means, but it was good in my opinion. The prices are a bit on the high side though, so going during happy hour might be a good decision.  Overall, this place is great. If I ever wanted to hang out with friends and have a drink, this place would immediately come to mind. Definitely check it out!",

I had the same sandwich as I had in the other location and again, the brisket was top notch, topped with onion strings and BBQ sauce. The star of the sandwich was the green chile cheese sauce which I had served on the side. You can dip those fries and your sandwich in the sauce and you will leave happy. Prices are about $12 per sandwich and the indoor crowd had thinned out by around 8:30pm on a Saturday night. The back patio was still packed as we left, so the party continues out there with the youngsters.",

    "text": "Well, after visiting twice over the weekend and three times since the new year, I figured I had better add my review to the pile.  It has a causal, very dog friendly vibe. The kind of place that fits perfectly in the Arcadia neighborhood.  On the Friday night it was busy when I arrived there with friends around 8pm. A nice mix of locals and tourists ranging from dressed up to casual.  The crowd died off around 10 or 11pm.  On Sunday afternoon, the back patio was full of people. The access to the walking trail along the Indian School Canal pulls people in, especially if out waking their dogs. This place has water dishes and free dog treats. As I mentioned, VERY dog friendly.  I came for beers with friends, but we had some food too. The flatbread was good with an appreciated, slightly flaky crust. The other food items were also enjoyable as batter than average bar food fare.  TIP: Happy Hour is Monday through Friday from 11am until 6pm. All Arizona pitchers of beer (about 2.5 pints), all glasses of wine, and all house specialty cocktails are $6.  By the way, in March they are opening a third location in Paradise Valley at the intersection of Tatum and Shea.",

Some places don't let you bring outside food in - so it was so great that they let us bring our own cake because it was custom made and beautiful. OHSO has the best mojitos I have ever had.

They were out of more beer than they had on tap, and the kicker is they didn't even have the courtesy to print out an updated drink menu! We had to have asked for at least 6 different beers that were on the menu but they were out of. And not even \"just ran out\", two of the beers they've been out of for two months! We would have stayed for a few more beers if they carried what they said they did. I'm hoping for a better experience next time.",

They have a \"barking bar\" where you can fill up a plastic container of water for your dog, and bags of dog biscuits. The servers even seemed used to doling out food with a dog laying between their feet.  They did have a really good beer list. They were out of the White Chocolate Ale, which was what I'd been looking forward to, so I settled for an Arizona Peach instead. That was pretty depressing to me though, being out of a beer. - 1/2 star. The service was very hit-or-miss. The servers were a little standoffish until later, when ours seemed to have a change of heart and came over to say hi to my dog. It did take a little bit for things to come out. The bus boy never brought the box I requested either :/  -1/2 star again.   We came to drink, but also had the spinach artichoke dip with crab; it was good, bit spicy on some bites with onion, but the crab was a nice topping choice. I wish there had been more pita bread, but I doubt it would have showed up had I asked for it.  I know this isn't OHSO's fault either, but it was incredibly strange that there were so many kids there. It's happy hour... at a nanobrewery.... and I'm having to watch my pirate language because of the 8 year olds wearing Catholic school girl uniforms sitting one stool over. Awkward.   Edit: I forgot to mention, the valet parking bit. There's maybe 15 spots that belong to OHSO. Otherwise, it's a mandatory valet parking job. This is just weird... I now feel obligated to tip someone to drive my car 10 feet away to a spot. The person who said \"job creation\" in a previous review was totally right.   - 1/2 star for the atmosphere being... jarred and the valet parking weirdness.",

It was 2ish, so the restaurant was busy, but not packed.  The music on the front patio roared.  The four of us had a selection of different beers and entrees.  The entree portions were smaller than usual and just OK for taste.  When the waiter brought two apple pies for dessert, he noticed our looks and said \"They're kind of small, so I'll take care of one for you.\"  Didn't happen -- both appeared on the bill.  Worst of all, we ordered two growlers of Orange Blossom to take home which we later found to be something totally different.    A weird experience which wasn't like the OHSO I used to know, but seemingly more typical of recent visits.  I'll give it a pass for awhile and see if they straighten out.",

My partner and I were excited to see OHSO from the street, and I was particularly intrigued with the \"Nano Brewery\" moniker. Sounds great! Big disappointment. They are trying to be like St. Francis or The Vig, and it ain't working for them.   And then I ordered a $12 or $13 \"flatbread,\" which was a tiny square pizza with hot cucumbers on top of it. That's right . . . cooked cucumbers. Ugh!!! After scraping the cucumbers off, the balance of the chicken flatbread tasted OK. But like so many things on the menu here at OHSO, it was overpriced and uninspired.  I like the beer list, but that's about it. Give it a little more intimate interior design, set up an outrageous happy hour, and this place could make it. But not like it is now. No way.  Edited on Jan 3, 2015: We've been back. We really like the back patio there. Beer choices are great, not so much difference on food. I'd like a better happy hour. Bumping up by one star.",

    "text": "I was very excited to check this place out with a friend of mine. It's always nice to have a new spot open up in the area. You always hope that someone has finally done it right. The unfortunate truth is that this place needs to be on the show called \"Restaurant Impossible\". I'm not kidding when I say this, go and see for yourself.  I have no animosity for this place, it was just very disappointing to see a group of guys / young boys (owners/Investors) standing around in their poor choice of wanna be club shirts that they probably got on sale at Marshall's, along with their poor hair grooming and unprofessional demeanor. It was as if they felt that their machine was up and running and that no improvements or the customer experience was even a possibility of a real issue. The bartender had a frown on his face the entire time, and our waitresses were as friendly as can be but really need to be informed and educated on their brews. I do not put this responsibility on the girls as much as I do the poor management.  Now, with my ranting aside, my reasons for disappointment were as follows:  We ordered the Brewer's Choice Plate which consisted of Mortadella, Prosciutto, and Tuscan Salami, along with a choice of cheeses and a bunch of fillers that they included.  The plate came out and was presented well, but right away the cuts of meat were a disappointment. The thickness of the cuts was ridiculous and embarrassing. The Mortadella was almost room temperature, which can actually be a health hazard. Prosciutto was some sort of cheap salt cured, and hopefully pre-sliced. If they sliced it in house their chef should be fired for slicing such a thick cut of prosciutto. Even a non-chef knows that much. The salami was certainly nothing special, and again the Mortadella was the biggest disappointment. With this as my first impression of the food, I was very turned off and don't see them lasting very long if they don't fix such simple but important things. I suggest that they visit 'The Parlor' and take a look at the quality of the Artisan meats that they serve on their carving board, along with the thickness and temp of the meats. There is no comparison, and this is a no brainer for even a Foodie, much less a chef or a business that was swarming with inexperienced management at the time.  So the next item was the Meat and Potato Flatbread with Pork Belly and three cheeses. I will say that it was mediocre, but missing some element of flavor to make it complete. The chips and guacamole were simple, but no complaints there. I enjoyed the Yucca Chips.  I am not trying to be an extreme hater, but this place has a ton of hype out there and they aren't delivering quality products or service. They need to turn it up and light a fire under the asses of these young guys that are looking at a high profit margin by sacrificing quality food. They will need to offer much higher quality products if they want to stay afloat.   i wish them the best and would love to try them again if I hear that they got everything straightened out. This would be an ideal location and they have a great concept.  Cheers and good luck guys! Constructive criticisms are all I am offering and wish you the best. :)",

My french toast was pretty good and I like that they give you the choice of beer or mimosa. The servers were nice, they were running drink orders but still had to the time to explain to me the meaning of the name: \"outrageous homebrewers social outpost\" and the way the brew-your-own beer works. Talked to a nice couple who had just brewed their first batch and had come in to taste it/enjoy on draught. The concept is quite innovative/unique/cool...you come in, pay $50 to brew, pick your flavors, start your brew, they ferment it for you, feature it on draught, and then give you a $50 gift card to buy your beer or any others that are on draught. I didn't bring my dog with me but like/appreciate the dog-friendliness of the establishment and took one of their \"to-go\" treats home for him. He liked it. Wish I was staying longer in PHX otherwise I would've started brewing my own beer!",

    "text": "Wanted to update after doing the brewers experience. Thats right, I brewed my own beer at OHSO! So basically you sign up for one of the dates on their iphone app. They have a list of dates and then each date has a different type of beer. So porters, ipa's, amber, then some interesting specialty beers.  You pay but then they give you a gift certificate for the same amount back so it free then right?   Anyway, expect to spend about 5 hours when you brew. Dave the head brewer was awesome and went through the whole process and answered any questions we had. Although you might think you are stuck making a plain old porter for example, they are great in embracing your creativity. You can add ingredients, make it more or less hoppy. You get to customize everything. Dave's first answer when asking about adding things is yes. He also explains why something might not work how you want and makes alternate suggestions. The brewing area is in the open so the whole time people were taking pictures and asking questions who were there eating dinner.   This is pretty unique. Don't think i've ever heard of a place letting you brew your own beer and then letting you have it up on the board for sale.  So you get to brew your beer and then you name it and pick a tapping date. Thats right, your own beer will be for sale at OHSO.   Oh by the way, you can eat and drink while your brewing. If you need beers or food they will have it brought over for you.  So lets recap fowks...You get to spend 5 hours brewing your own beer while drinking beer! Then you get to go back a month later and drink your own beer and see it proudly displayed on the beer list..",

As far as there beer 3 stood out The Morning Brew, Peanut Britt and The Hoppy. The Morning Brew and the Hoppy were pretty good the only reason The Peanut Britt stood out cause it was different it wasn't great but not bad I would not have more then a pint.. The BBQ Burger Was very good asked for pink in the middle there was no pink but it still was good. I'll go back for sure",

Madison was very understanding and even sent us a gift card for our next visit. It's been a couple months since our last visit and we went back on Saturday. It was a much MUCH better experience. The hostess greeted us ASAP and acknowledged that we will be seated shortly. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable of the beer selections and specials. We were not going to come back, but the manager took the time and responded to our comments. We also love the fact that OHSO is dog friendly AND supports local animal shelters. Food was good and beer was nice and cold. Thank you to Madison and the OHSO staff for making this visit a much enjoyable one.",

We started with the spinach artichoke and crab dip, which was pretty good but a little too fishy, like the crab wasn't fresh. I had the OHSO salad, which was good. The cook on the steak was nice, and the greens were fresh. My husband had the gnocchi bolognese, which he enjoyed, but he felt that the sausage on the dish was overpowering. Red wine sangria was fine - nothing extraordinary, but good.  The service was very slow, and honestly pretty bad. I don't know if our server forgot our table was there, but she seemed more interested in chatting with the table behind us than taking our orders and refilling our drinks. I also think the portions are small for the price.  Overall, we had an OK time. I would go back for drinks. I'm hoping the bad service was a one time fluke.",

Everyone enjoyed their meal, besides that people who got the \"Biscuits and Beer Gravy\"... TOO MUCH PEPPER in the sausage. YUMMY biscuit, and all the meals came with a choice of a beer or mimosa. I chose the mimosa... PERFECT!   My pregnant wife however was not able to enjoy one of the tasty mimosa's. Instead, she decided to get a soda. Much to our surprise, our bill came with 2 brunch combo's which included 2 drinks, and a charge for her soda... Long story short, the manager told us that they want to encourage drinking with brunch and that there are zero substitutes... They wouldn't budge for my pregnant wife or my 14 y.o. cousin. They said to \"give it to someone else at the table\". We asked to have the additional beverages comp'd (2 sodas $4.50...20 cents each @cost). We were told no again, and given our checks back.  Poor logic, management, and customer service. I get it, it's a brewery what do you expect. I would expect some type of accommodation or option given the family based neighborhood they are located in, and trying to attract the \"Brunch\" crowd. Their wait staff was great and did everything they could to find alternatives to the drink situation... Regardless of cost, have some type of substitution, know your margins, and please your customers!  My family of 14 will not be returning for brunch again, or for a late night beer.",

However I have been a handful of times and the service makes me cringe every single time.     I hate to be harsh, but this is a reoccurring problem. Servers are rude and don't care. Last time I went my first server rolled her eyes when my friends and I ordered alcohol, demanded an ID then a second form from all of us... One of my friends only had her passport and the server made a severely snide comment about that. After the ID mishap she rudely stated she wasn't going to help us and pointed to a man saying \"your his\" then strutted away. We had to reorder our first round 10 minutes when he came around. The second server was not much better. If you want to spend money to be ignored and made to feel inferior, then by all means OHSO is your type of place.",

I would definitely go there again.",

    "text": "As you may have read the \"tip\", you already know our experience was one of the saddest we have had since moving to the valley. So much so, that I created this yelp account just to express how terrible it was.   Is the food good?? Don't know. It never arrived after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito. Is the beer (hefe) good? No. At least the first 10oz weren't. Never had waiter come back to try anything else.   Poor service reflects poor management(\"louie\" sp?), very pricey and in no way a brewery in my eyes. Steer clear and try Sun Up brewery instead! Waaay better beer, food, and outstanding service! Might give osho another shot someday when I'm not hungry or thirsty or have something to do or awake. Hope this helps fellow yelpers!   Oh ya and if you're a blonde stripper/escort driving a fancy Mercedes you'll get valet to park it right at the door, priority order service, and skip the valet wait line at pick up! Now that's a classy joint!  UPDATE...... Contacted by actual manager ,the day after posting, seeking resolution. That's a big deal in my book! Looking forward to returning and giving OHSO another try.  Stay tuned for the next update..",

First time-sub par  Second time-we left because no one had paid any attention to us in the 30 minutes we sat on the patio.  Third time-thought I would give it another try when my dad asked where I wanted to meet him for dinner. I was embarrassed at my recommendation at the end of the night due to our poor service. We had incorrect orders, empty water glasses, slow service all around.  Bottom line-the food is decent(the burger was great but everything else just eh), the location is fantastic, and the atmosphere is great. However the poor service makes me not want to go back. Ever.",

    "text": "What a fantastic little gem this place is!  The atmosphere is very laid back, the employees are fun loving people, the ambiance is wonderful. I love the simple wood designs and the casual decorations. No formalities needed, just come on down and have a seat.  The first and most important thing is the beer. You won't see any crap beer on the menu-- these are people who embody and respect the craft culture. In addition to a few of their own house brews they carry a wide range of Arizona brewed selections from names you'll likely recognize. They also have an impressive selection of pumpkin beers, if you're into that sort of thing. I guess now is the season. it's a tough call as to where you'll want to sit but at night there is no where I'd rather be than in the lovely patio, which surrounds a classically designed center bar with plenty of screens for the sports minded among us. It's basketball season now and I can't wait to take advantage of that here.   I suggest you try this place out on a weeknight first, as there was absolutely no wait and the service was prompt. I can't stress enough just how cool everyone who works here seems to be-- yet another effect of the craft culture I suppose. The food is also damn good. It's mostly hearty, burger based fare-- the kind of stuff that goes oh so well with a fine brewed beverage. The shoestring fries are good munching. My brisket sandwich was pretty loaded and more than adequate to satisfy my immense hunger. They do have a selection of tacos and veggie burgers for your lighter eaters. The prices are pretty reasonable and hardly outside of the range of your average craft beer drinker.  It's gonna be a good season of sports with a place like this to retreat to.",

They have very good beer selection, I was excited to try Up the River Lager and get that almost every time since it's not readily available in Phoenix.    The back patio is a great area to sit and I love the diversity of people who come here, dog lovers, bike riders, families, hipsters, after work crowd.  Last time I went, they had their microbrews available and I tried the grapefruit, which I was actually disappointed by it.

The place serves a selection of traditional pub fare, along with some gourmet selections.  The also feature locally crafted beer and wines, in addition to a full bar.  I tried one of the flatbread pizzas, while my guests had the pork tacos and the veggie burger.  The food was fresh and flavorful, and we all enjoyed our meals.  I do, however, think that some of their prices are a bit ambitious, and rival higher class places in downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale. For example the flatbread pizzas are priced at the level of some authentic gourmet pizza places like Pomo and La Piazza Locale, which are way out of their league.  As far as the pub part, I cannot comment on since I was at a working lunch and therefore could not indulge.",

Food is excellent and there is a variety of meat and veg dishes from which to choose.

However, the lukewarm elbow pasta with a confusing white cream sauce with bits of veggies did not appeal to the taste buds.  The brisket was more like shredded beef, consistency is similar to chipotle's barbacoa.  The bacon and cheese burger was just as lackluster.  I should have stopped by Jack-in-a-Box and get a double bacon cheeseburger.  Not to mention that the game froze during the second quarter.  Twin peaks would have been a better food and entertainment experience.",

My server was very patient with the number of questions I asked about the food and beer menus. She admitted she hadn't tried everything yet (which is better than people who give phony recommendations leaving you with something you don't like), but did make some great suggestions based on what she liked and offered to bring another server over whom she thought had tried some of the other menu items.   The food was quickly served and was beyond delicious. I was actually pretty impressed since I was expecting it to be more \"bar food\" since that's what comes to mind when I hear \"Brewery\".  But it was a high quality MEAL, not just appetizers. The owner was around and seemed to be involved in making sure the place was running smoothly.   Besides being very satisfied with the meal, I really love the atmosphere. I can't wait for nicer weather to sit out on the patio. I like that every room is so different and is offering basically whatever you're looking for in atmosphere. After talking to the server about future plans for this place, I couldn't be more excited about how close this place is to my house. I expect that when these plans come into play (live bands, make your brew, etc.) start happening, I will be updating this to a 5 star rating.",

I got the carnitas and it came with a 10oz beer. I got Papago Orange Blossom and it was warm. Flat and warm like the keg is sitting outside. The carnitas were flavorful, really good and the eggs weren't overcooked like how so many people serve scrambled. I enjoyed the way it was plated, and presentation was clean. I came back again for a Sunday brunch a few weeks later and ordered the Belgian Waffle. It was good, but not at all amazing. I ordered everything on the side to be able to try the waffle alone, and it was kind of bland. My berries were absolutely dead, like they were sitting out in the hot kitchen all throughout brunch. This time my beer was not warm, but hot. I left the full beer behind, as did the people I was with. I don't understand how a brewery can serve hot beer. The third time I went was for Father's day brunch. They weren't that busy surprising and I arrived early and got a table before the rest of my party. Ordered the biscuits and gravy and it came out cold. Sent it back and got another order. Hot gravy, cold biscuits. The biscuits were griddled, too, and you could see the marks on it. So they marked and toasted them ahead of service and them just serve them with hot gravy. Well cold biscuits are gross, and dense so hot gravy doesn't really warm them up. I ended up not eating it, and having lunch at a new old town restaurant. The food comes up quickly but it seems like every time I go in it gets worse and worse. I love the atmosphere here, but with mediocre food and hot beer I don't really have a reason to go back.",

The food really varies in terms of its quality on a continuous basis. The menu really never has changed and especially the side dishes. I am waiting for the day when the sides change from the current five or six choice. I am a vegan and I always get the vegan burger. I wish there were more choices for vegans but as like most eateries in this meat loving town there are not.

And anyplace that serves grilled asparagus as a side option ($1 extra) gets my vote!  My biggest regret is that I was too full to try the caramel apple pie--the table next to us had it and it looked and smelled delicious!

    "text": "This weekend was the first time we tried out OHSO and we cant wait to go back. The food is great, the beer list is extensive and it's great to be able to taste all the beers for just a buck each (3oz) before you commit to a pint. Our server (I wish i remembered her name) was great.... she was attentive, very knowledgeable about the beers and offered recommendations and of course very friendly! The patio is great also- I can't wait till it cools down. If you haven't tried OHSO yet you need to!!!!!!",

I had one of their own brews though they had a wonderful selection on tap of other breweries.  They pulled pork sandwich was great.",
