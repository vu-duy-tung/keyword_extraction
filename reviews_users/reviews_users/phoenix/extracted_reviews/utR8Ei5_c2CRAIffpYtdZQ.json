    "text": "Not kid friendly, despite Yelp's recommendation. There is no kid menu so the kids have to order adult portions at adult prices which is a waste of food and money. There is also no changing table in the bathroom for the youngest kids. This was disappointing and frustrating. Also, the bacon is not plain regular normal bacon. It's peppered bacon. Nowhere on the menu is this mentioned. It wasn't bad, my partner enjoyed it. But kids typically don't eat peppered anything so it was a waste of money to order it for them.  The waitstaff need to be assigned tables. It seems they have their waiters visit any and all tables which means guests are either being underserved or overserved. We had to ask three different times for water, but then we received two checks. It was just weird.  The food wasn't anything spectacular. I ordered a waffle which was really good. The breakfast sandwich was just ok.  Overall disappointing. Definitely wouldn't recommend or visit again.",

With misters and shade it would have been nice. So after 20 we got 2 seats at the counter. The menu is pretty basic in my opinion. But on the paper mat they had steak and eggs potato and toast. Steak was ok. Smaller than what my wife got with a fair amount of gristle. I got the home frys. But they were just cut up potatoes and luke warm at best. That was 16.95. So after drink you were at $20. Kinda disappointed. Oh well this will just be a once in a while thing for the wife.",

Hash browns are perfectly crispy, pancakes have a great flavor and texture that pushes up on the border of savory, and the Bloody Marie's might be the most delicious I've ever had (I did have a really amazing one at Aria in Vegas).  Anyways, went to this place a year ago passing through AZ, and couldn't wait to pass through again.  Finally returned, and this spot didn't disappoint.  They slightly screwed up our order, and no less than 3 different servers came out to apologize, so excellent service as with, with a staff of people who seem to enjoy their jobs.

    "text": "While I'm giving this 5 stars, I do understand the 3 star reviews. The menu is basic, and the food is fairly basic too. However, I'm giving 5 stars because everything they do, they do right and if you order the right items they can be uniquely delicious. I'll run through my usual order of the Hog and Chick. There are a few options.  The way I get it is with eggs over easy, home fries, bacon, and sourdough bread.   I'll start out with the bacon. Even if you've had a lot of bacon in your life, you've probably never had bacon like this. It's on a whole new level. Don't even think about not ordering bacon. It's somewhat caramelized and peppered at the same time, but not sweet, more pepper flavored. It's hard to explain. Nothing about it is overbearing. They always seem to cook it just right too.  The eggs are eggs, and they aren't done up any differently than you'd expect from over easy eggs however I would say out of the 5 times or so I've been here, they have been cooked perfectly each time with a liquid yolk.   The home fries (always get the home fries over hash browns here) are diced potatoes mixed with sauteed onions, salt, and fresh rosemary. This tastes really good, and perfectly ties together the eggs and bacon. A few small bits of rosemary add a great flavor. The hashbrowns, while they are competently made, are plain in comparison to the home fries. So go with the home fries.  And finally, I save my sourdough bread for dessert. It's served warm with butter and homemade preserves. Superb bread, and together with the preserves makes for a treat.  I also enjoy the ambiance at this location. Even though you might have to go a little out of your way to get to it, parking right in front of it is easy. Once you're inside, it's bright and cheery and has a nice energy without being either too loud or quiet. They don't play music. The wall painting features local landmarks including Hayden Butte and the old flour mill, and the football stadium. The bar seating is really comfortable and serves me well for going in alone with a book.  Tables and booths are great when you're there with other people. The interior isn't hipster/trendy like a lot of places, but also isn't boring or dull. Great place for any breakfast/brunch occasion.",

    "text": "Food isn't that bad, it was my third time going as it was conveniently close to my gym. The way I was treated by the manager however was very surprising. We had a group of 6 waiting to get seated for breakfast. We asked the host when we could be seated and she told us about 25 or 30 minutes. Then the manager came by and aggressively said we probably won't be seated for about 40 minutes. This was understandable since it was a busy Saturday morning. After about 10 minutes seats at the bar became available and I asked the host if we could just sit there, she said yes so we did. After sitting down the manager yells across the restaurant asking what we're doing and yelling that we couldn't sit there. I was a bit defensive as the host said we could. Then the manager made a bit of a scene and came over and kicked us out of the bar using a very patronizing tone saying we had to wait like everyone else even though the host said we could sit there. Even the employee behind the bar seemed confused as to why we couldn't sit there. Anyway, the manager didn't even give us a reason why we couldn't, so we all left hungry, and angry at his behavior. My advice is to make customer service a priority and not patronize customers. I usually write positive reviews and maybe he's usually cool, but this guy was acting like ass hole.",

It was on a roll which is different but the roll held the sandwich well. The steak and eggs were cooked perfectly and the boyfriend was happy. Overall very solid breakfast place with good food and a nice atmosphere. I will definitely keep it in mind the next time I am in Tempe!",

They say a dog will chew on a bone until you give him a steak..and once I tried Matt's, I couldn't go back to growth-hormone, trans-fatty el cheapo choke n puke.   Been to Matt's at all locations, including the airport, and the Tempe location delivers the goods just like you want them to. Everything locally sourced, jam home made, and pure maple syrup.  Organic cage free eggs, and their iconic thick cut bacon. I personally love the french toast! There is literally not a bad item on the menu. Yes, it is popular...yes, you might have to wait. But that's a trifle when you are sitting down to the highest quality, tastiest breakfast/brunch meal in town.   If you want to try the lunch, go for the Reuben, the Burger or the BLT. They all rock.",

Service My sister and I visited at 9am to avoid long waits, and it was perfect the entire restaurant was pretty much empty. With that being said, I expected decent service but nope. Our waitress, Michelle, wasn't very kind and didn't welcome us when she first arrived to our table. She also never once checked on us during our meal. And instead of saying thank you when she dropped off the check, she just put it on our table and walked away. I wish I could've given the tip to the manager, I think his name was David, instead of her. He checked on us AND picked up the dirty dishes.   Coffee Oh my god, the coffee was just terrible. Very bitter, I couldn't even finish half the cup.   Food options Everything has Pig products and you can't substitute anything for those products. We had to say no bacon and pay full price for another side (hash browns). Instead of just switching them out like they do at every other restaurant.   So.. why did I even give them 3 stars instead of 2 or 1? The manager did a great job checking on us, the whole place was spotless, the food was good (especially the strawberry jam) and I feel like being nice.  Would I recommend Matt's Big Breakfast? No way! And I will NOT be returning.",

Also one VERY important note: the waffle automatically comes with REAL maple syrup; none of that disgusting liquid sugar crap here! And, yes, the serving size of maple syrup the waffle cones with is totally plenty and you do not need to pay the charge for extra syrup! It's the late (sleep in on the weekends) brunch spot of choice for my husband and I when we want some great food - rather breakfast or lunch! And if you're feeling lunchy instead of breakfasty the Butter Burger, or my personal favorite, The Rueben are the perfect choices!  Okay...why are you still reading this review?!?! Go to Matt's - go now!!",

Breakdown of the \"experience\" is as follows:  Hash browns- terrible, no one ate them; to be fair, we did not try the home fries Bacon- LOADED with pepper; probably great for an Bloody Mary Coffee- not a lot of options for sweeteners and coffee cups are stained inside (all 4 at Table) Sourdough toast was good. They could/would not substitute fruit for the hash browns. Patio looked nice, but no outdoor heaters and the temperature was in 46 degrees.  Last but not least, Unfortunately the service was sub-par, we were really looking forward to trying this new location which appeared to have all the ingredients to be a new favorite spot...location is PRIME though, I can see parking being a little tricky on a busy morning. Maybe their lunch menu is better...",

The menu only has a handful of options for breakfast and lunch, which is fine (especially when the dishes are exceptional) but they are incredibly basic. They didn't taste terrible, but they weren't that great either; the flavor was lacking, and the amount of grease was a little too much for my liking.  I can say the coffee was good, as well as the Arnold Palmer I got, but the food itself... not so great.",

A number of waitresses walked past us for about 10 minutes. Not even an \" I'll be right with you\". We finally placed our order. Coffee, a grain bowl for me and an  omelette and potatoes for my man. 1/2 hour wait. I know because of a time check. We had another place to be after breakfast. We had to flag down another waitress to get our coffee. A different waitress came by to ask for our order again because they lost it. The food finally arrived. Mine was inedible. Half the bowl full of water and none of the sea salt listed in the description. The omelette was cold. No one stopped by to ask how the food was. Asked for a manager. No apology and seemed unfazed, although we weren't charged.  Altogether a bizarre experience. And why did we not walk out? Maybe we just didn't have enough coffee to think rationally.",

I got the \"special\" with polish sausage and peppers. It sounded better than it was. Omelet was runny, hate that. And just unimpressive.  Only good thing about the meal was the thick toast...but really....its toast. There's nothing \"big\" about the portion either, so I don't know about the \"big breakfast\" thing.

Not simply orders wrong, but drink orders weren't taken for a good 10 minutes and cocktails didn't come out until halfway through the eating our meals.  We were sitting less than 30 feet from the full bar so it was tempting to just go and place an order for the same drinks and see which would get there first.  Location is nice.  Tempe hipsters aren't too bad to deal with.  All in all a good meal, but I'll drive past this location and go to downtown next time.  Addendum:  My Bloody Mary cost more than my entire meal.  Now...maybe it was bottomless, but as stated above...didn't come until late into the meal and never saw my server until he brought the check.",

When we got the food, there was bacon right across the entire plate. He didn't even notice until the second time he came around and said \"aw they gave you bacon?\" And proceeded to charge us for both bacon and hash browns. We didn't have the time to even point out the mistake. Honestly this was the worst customer service and worst breakfast I've had. Far from brain food. Was late to my final.

First time waiter didn't put in our whole order, didn't apologize just asked if we still wanted it. Second time, waited 30 minutes for our food just for another waiter to come out and tell us sorry the computer didn't send your order to the kitchen so they're making it now. Pretty sure that's the waiter's job to check on our order but he was nowhere to be found. We just left after waiting almost 40 minutes. This location needs new management.",

The front of the house staff didn't seem to care we were there. We were told to seat ourselves. There weren't many tables open so we sat at the bar. Our server quickly got us water and our drinks but after that we couldn't get her attention to order to get refills, at one point. We just asked whom ever we could for more coffee and water and even our check. It was a real disappointment, I had been looking forward to trying that place out for a while. The food was good but the menu is super limited. Everything we wanted were only specials on certain days which is weird because Eggs Benedict and French toast are usual breakfast teams. When we left we saw out server walking back with Starbucks, that explains why we couldn't get service haha! We're pretty laid back but when I have to go find my server so I can order there's a problem there. We won't be going back to Matt's Big Breakfast, there are so many options in the area that do it better and with better service. Which is too bad because that kitchen staff made a great first impression.",

We ordered our food and didn't receive it all, and when we asked her for it she just said it will come later and it never came. And I don't know why, but we got really small glasses for water and she never filled up. After that she never came back to check on us. I had to ask another waitress for the check and take it to the to go counter to pay for a meal we didn't even get all of the food we ordered for.

We knew what we wanted right away and ordered the steak Sunday special (medium rare), the five spot, waffle plate, and one pancake on the side. They brought out my steak well done and although more than willing to cook me a new one, the new steak was still subpar and quite pricey at $15! The waffle was soft and kinda deflated. The five spot was pretty good, but our pancake on the side never came out. The overall experience was meh, but the long wait on top of the subpar service gives this place an overall 2/5 score.

My negative review has to do with families with small kids me being one of them I went to change my 6 month old and went into the restroom where I saw there was no changing table.  This was a newer restaurant and I was appalled that I had to change her on the floor. The handicap stall was large enough where a table could've placed on the wall. After changing her I looked for the manager.  He said it was not his doing and if I would have said something before changing my daughter he would have had me go behind the barn door where they store chairs etc and i could change her there.  That's horrible too.  He apologized to me again on the way out and proceeds to tell me they are getting one installed soon but yet he didn't tell me that earlier. I would be curious if someone can tell me one was actually installed.  Other females in the bathroom also said this was bad as they saw me in the floor with my child.  Luckily I had all my stuff with me so she wasn't entirely on the floor.",

It's odd to me that you can only get certain menu items on certain days, especially since the regular menu is really small.  Service was just OK, but I'm usually impressed when I get better than terrible service at any restaurant or bar in Tempe.  If I go back, I'll probably order waffles or pancakes as that seems to be Matt's specialty;  I had eggs Benedict since it was Thursday and didn't find them to be special.  Would be 2 stars but I bumped it up for the cool location.",

    "text": "I would have given this a better review, but the hostess knew my friend and apparently had a personal issue with her and chose to skip us several times on the waitlist intentionally. I brought this up with a manager finally when people who were just walking in were being sat after we had been waiting for 20 minutes. Given it was a Sunday morning, we knew we would be waiting, but not after people who were under us on the waitlist and who we witnessed walk in and put their name down after us.  Once we were finally sat, I am not sure if our server was super busy or forgot about us, but a manager ended up taking care of us the entire time. The chocolate milk claimed to be organic, but when I got it, it was poorly mixed with syrup which I do not like at all. They use ghiradelli apparently to mix it, but still, mention on the menu that it is not organic or that it is made with ghiradelli chocolate syrup.  I got the waffle with berry compote and it was very yummy and I had a side of bacon which was amazing as well. Had it not been for the start to our meal, I probably would be rating this restaurant at least 4 stars, but the experience starts the minute you walk in the door. Being rushed to sit in a section where the server was not ready was not exactly what we were hoping for either. I would love to say I'll give this place another try, but I probably won't. The parking situation is sort of annoying since you have to park in the garage and have a two hour limit before it's not free (no validation needed) and the walk is not really enjoyable either.",

Our waitress was unwelcoming and seemed bored or angry. She brought my 2 year old a glass of milk in an actual glass with no lid and no straw. We had to ask for a child's cup which they did have(wtf). She refused to make any exceptions or changes to the menu items at our request. We were not allowed to substitute anything without paying for it. The menu is fairly small and uninspired for a breakfast place. Pretty basic. The prices were high though, I paid 10.95 for a burger which was actually really good(earned the 1 star on this review). The other items ranged from 1.50 for 1 egg(lol) I can buy a whole carton for that price, up to 13ish. They only have basic drinks as well. Plain old coffee, tea and lemonade. The chocolate milk was $3.25!!!  When the bill came we asked to have the items split between my friend and I, the waitress refused and said she couldn't do that. Ok so we asked for two separate checks then, she said she couldn't do that either!!!! Wtf?? So we got a little testy with her and asked for her manager. She went off and came back with two split checks lol saying her manager helped her-whatever. So rude and I would never come back here. Not worth the money for stuff that IHOP has.  Go to snooze down the street, so much better all around and cheaper!",

We also had the Hog and Chick breakfast which included 2 eggs over easy, 3 thick pieces of seasoned bacon, buttered toast with fresh blueberries. The portions were good size and more importantly everything was seasoned just right and tasted great. The location is very easy to get to just off of Rio Salado on lower level of one of the State Farm buildings on the south side of Tempe Town Lake.  Plenty of seating. Glass walls open up to the outdoors. Service was excellent and worthy of 5 stars all by itself. After thinking about a desert we decided order a Waffle. It is so delicious, nothing like we've ever tasted.   Photos will tell rest of the story.",

Today I went to the Tempe location and , although it was good, it was like the skeleton of what once was. The waffle that used to melt in your mouth unlike anything I had ever experienced was now just a little better than average and the famously amazing hash browns were tough and cold. Maybe this is the cost of an expanding business, but it's sad, I feel like something truly special has been lost. Hopefully the downtown location still has its magic.",

Other servers brought our food (which is pretty normal, but she didn't even come by to see if everything was ok), and we had to flag down others for coffee refills. Even then, it took a very long time to even have our coffee refilled. Granted, it was a Saturday, and it was busy, but to leave your table to the semi-care of other servers is not good. Unfortunately, I didn't get our waitress's name, but then we only saw her once....  One other thing, PLEASE start offering half-and-half for the coffee. It's very odd for a breakfast joint with really great, organic food, and good coffee, to only have milk available.",

The powdered sugar adds a nice texture to the waffle once you add the maple syrup, almost like it crystallizes the sugar. The bacon was fantastic.

Then again, it's not like I have a show on the Food Network so here are some words on a screen.  The three of us stopped by after our spin class at Cyclebar.  We were sweaty, hungry, and feeling good after our post-cycle mimosas.  Aw yis!  Run me a bath filled with hollandaise sauce while I devour perfectly poached eggs on golden toasted English muffins while I laugh maniacally over nothing!  Too bad this didn't happen as they do not serve Eggs Benedict on Sundays.  What!?  Sunday is for brunch and Eggs Benedict is the undisputed king of all brunch foods!  My heart broke.  The second heartbreak came shortly after when I was given my can of beer with a freshly-washed HOT glass.  Rapidly warming beer, anyone?  Blegh!  So since the Matt's Tradition, also known as the daily special, said Eggs Benedict was served on a weekday instead, I ordered the Sunday special of Steak and Eggs.  I had ordered my steak medium rare but was given a medium cooked steak.  Where's the ruby red center!?  Lame.  On the side was beautiful over-easy eggs that bled its gorgeous yolks all over my plate with the slightest prick of my knife.  The hashbrowns were super crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  All it needed was a little ketchup and some Tapitio [no Tabasco or Cholula here, folks] and they were delish.  I ordered rye bread at no extra cost and they were cut thick, smeared with butter, and layered with housemade preserves.  It was like dessert.  Yum!  All in all, it's a solid breakfast place that is easily rated at 3.5 stars.  But still, it's just breakfast --- a locally sourced and organic breakfast but it's just eggs and meat, y'all!  I would come back but maybe not when I'm super hungry because that hour wait is not cute.",

The BBB is half a pound of hand-pressed Niman Ranch ground chuck grilled in butter served with American cheese- yum!  The service was great and we had our food in no time. If you're expecting me to say that the burger was dripping in butter, it wasn't, but that's a good thing.  It was a tasty cheeseburger and I liked it!  The only drawback is that I wish it were served with fries; potato chips are what you get with this burger.  Other than that, I can truly say that I'd eat here again and look forward to trying a Big Breakfast next time we're in town.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Big Country - In A Big Country)  I've never really eaten breakfast without the season Another coffee ordered through Another bacon passes by me  You never took the smile away from anybody's face And that's an appetizing way to look  For someone who is just a Yelper  At Matt's Big Breakfast foods stay with you  Like a hungry voice fires the griddlecakes Stay hungry!  Matt's Big Breakfast is now located in Tempe, but with not 1, not 2, but 3 locations popping; this local breakfast joint is the place to be!  I'm sure they're working on expanding to another!  I came with a group of runners after a quick run!  The place was banging with patrons and we had to wait another hour just to get seated.  Needless to say, I couldn't wait cause as the food passed us by and the smell of coffee; man I tell ya I was hungry!!    When we finally sat, I ordered some coffee and beer of course to carb load!  I proceeded with The Hog & Chick breakfast; 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, and wheat toast.  I also got the griddlecakes on the side just to try it.  Overall, a solid \"Big\" breakfast cause portions are not lacking here; I can hear Julia Child now, more butter!  The hash browns were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  The bacon was meaty and salty to the bite.  The eggs I liked over-easy and indeed it was.  I got some wheat toast which was thick like Texas toast, but I ate it as I progressed to my griddlecakes; which was sweet and toasty along with my warm maple syrup!  My friend ordered the Skinny; 4 eggs whites scrambled with gruyere cheese, spinach, and chicken apple sausage, served with a side salad.  She enjoyed her breakfast except the salad became soggy with dressing.    In the end, Matt's Big Breakfast did deliver some solid breakfast, but nothing spectacular.    Service was decent and the overall atmosphere was popping.  I rather enjoyed my breakfast and it was done the right way.  I appreciate them using local and organic products in Phoenix so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!",

A limited menu is fine when the establishment does the menu items well, and they do. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and they were DELICIOUS, and a great value. The bacon was cut thick, the bread was warm and soft and croissant-like, and the eggs were hot. I would definitely go back and get this again.",

I waited for 20 minutes just standing there in the way of everyone else and the bathrooms.  Finally the food comes up.  I just don't think this type of food holds up well to carryout and they use cardboard containers which just dont' work well either.  I thought the food was just plain gross and my toast was actually as black as asphalt.  Who would put that in there and think it was okay.  Those homemade preserves are running and disgusting and not a fan of their homemade ketchup??  I think i like Denny's better.  The parking is awkward here also, you are goign to have to go in the garage and get a ticket, hopefully you get out without issue.  Lots of people have problems.",

I walked in through what I thought was the front door and stood there feeling dumb for a few minutes before a woman walked up and asked if I was eating. I responded with yes and she proceeded to that there was a huge wait and stared at me waiting for my response. When I didn't offer one she reiterated \"like a really long wait. Like 40 minutes\" and waited agin for a response so I said okay. She responded again \"like at least 10 people ahead of you.\" And again I said okay. At this point I was frustrated. She let out a sigh and said \"okay well to check in with the hostess\" and walked off without even pointing me in the right direction. I walked around for a minute or two but I couldn't find the hostess and was so upset I just left. I will be going to the Phoenix location to finally try Matt's Big Breakfast, which is upsetting since I work right next to this one.",

Definately recommend if you want bite in the area - also good parking, which is helpful in this part of town.",

We never saw our server again after he took out order, had to ask for coffee and water refills.  Good was average.  I ordered the skinny which was described as the eggs with a small salad on the side.  It was quite the opposite.  A small potion of eggs and a huge salad but quite tasty.  My husband got the griddle cakes which were average but disappointed they didn't come  with bacon or sausage side.   The waffle does so why not the griddle cakes?   The manager came over and asked how we liked our bfast.  I mentioned it to him and he made light of it and redirected the conversation.  He was very friendly. Put $ on the counter to pay our bill and it sat there for 15 minutes before anyone asked if we were waiting to pay our bill.  Hoping a few things improve if we go there again",

MBB has the trifecta of amazing food, great friendly service, and a gorgeous setting, inside and out.   I've been a fan of MBB since the early days where only 25 people could eat there at a time. MBB was quickly known for thoughtful hearty breakfasts using only the finest ingredients from the best purveyors. Since that time MBB has grown and added locations and yet somehow has managed to maintain its integrity and heart- which is no small task.   This Tempe location is just stunning aesthetically. Nestled in the beautiful glass canyon that is the State Farm campus, MBBs sits like an inviting beacon- welcoming hungry office workers, students, and other people with superior taste buds.   This location is airy and bright, with beautiful touches everywhere the eye can see. It's immaculately clean and you can tell there is a lot of pride from the staff who keep it spotless.   The service is just awesome. I go weekly with my Sis and Niece- and the crew at MBB could not be more pleasant. My niece insists on showing all the staff her baby doll (Her name is \"Baby\" in case you were wondering) and they all take a minute to ask questions about the baby and talk to my niece, which is so sweet.  While they have so many awesome staff members, Michelle is our favorite. She's so warm and friendly and sincerely cares that all her guests are well cared for.  Having Michelle take care of you feels like you are a guest at her home- in the best possible way.   The food at MBB is epic in every aspect. I know some people make the argument \"It's just breakfast- I can make this stuff at home.\"  Two things. 1. Stop being a monster. 2. No you can't. You can make SOME kind of pancake, but you cannot replicate these griddle cakes. They are untouchable. Fluffy clouds of goodness that give you hope for humanity. My sis and I argue about waffles Vs. griddle cakes. Sadly she was dropped on her head a lot as a baby so she feels waffles are better, but we all know the truth.  See for yourself, either order a stack of griddle cakes or you can get one on the side to try for the table. I assure you that it will change your life.   After breakfast- take a stroll around the campus and see the beautiful fountains. You won't be disappointed by MBB or the views surrounding it.",

I used to make regular trips to Phoenix when they opened their original location, and I was always willing to endure the long wait because the food was that good.  I've now been to the Tempe location twice, but I probably won't be back anytime soon. The food is still good, but the service is terrible. The last time I went, I waited 20 minutes before a server came by to bring water. The guy working the door overheard us talk about leaving, and he promptly came to take our drink order. He was the only reason we stayed. But the service remained bad the rest of the time we were there, and the place wasn't even that busy. In fact, there were a bunch of servers just standing around talking most of the time we were there.  I've had similar service at this location twice now, so it seems like a management problem. Too bad, because I always thought the original Matt's was incredible and worth a wait. Hopefully someone can make a change to get the Tempe location better.",

I've had the steak and eggs, biscuit and sausage gravy, the hog and chick, and the salami scramble-- all of which tastes amazing. Their sourdough bread is unlike any sourdough I've tried before and it's really good, their hash browns and home fries are also yummy as well. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you choose lol. After you've stuffed yourself, you can walk your food baby off around Tempe Town Lake!!",

We decided to give it a try, how much worse could be... food,  when it finally arrived was cold and just plain average.  So sad.

    "text": "I work in the same complex as this restaurant and have given it a try several times, since it is one of only two options close by. The lunch food is overpriced, of poor quality, and the service is consistently horrible. There is always an excessive wait for food (even outside of rush period) and the staff are horrible--the management is no exception. This past visit was the last straw. My coworker's meal was taking a long time, and we even had to ask the manager if it was coming out anytime soon after waiting 20 minutes. I already had, had my food for quite a while, so I began eating my food in the meantime so I could enjoy it while still on my lunch break and while it was somewhat warm still. The manager brought out my coworkers food after we asked about it twice (and he had realized that he had forgotten about it on the counter). He then saw me eating my sandwich and informed me that my food was \"to-go\" and that I was not welcome to eat inside the restaurant. I tried explaining to him that I didn't plan on eating it there, but since my coworker was waiting so long on her food, I had decided to get started on my own lunch in the meantime. He didn't care and acted as if we were holding up seats.... keep in mind, there were plenty of open seats in the DINING area, and we were at a waiting area at the front of the place. My team and I won't be going to lunch here ever again.   On top of all of that, I ended up throwing my meal away and opting for a vending machine lunch. The chips were so greasy that grease had collected at the bottom of the container. As for my chicken wrap (CLT), well, it contained brown, soggy lettuce and unripe tomatoes, with just five tiny pieces of diced chicken (I know, because I counted after going in to search for them.",

We have learned after a few visits to Matt's that you need to go when it is quiet or you get terrible service. We went on this visit at 8am on a Sunday and it was perfect. Great service and good food. We got seated right away had good coffee that had a side of Irish whiskey for St Paddy's Day and to celebrate our anniversary. I had 2 eggs fried medium which were cooked perfectly and side of bacon and home fried potatoes with rosemary and onions; very tasty. Their thick slices of lightly toasted sourdough bread which is coated in melted butter and they serve a great blueberry jam on the side is wonderful. Of course my husband loved his waffle with bacon on the side. Great breakfast and we will return at times when it should be quiet.",

It's nestled in the midst of large high rises, near the water. There is a swanky gym nearby with lots of that foot traffic about.  Matt's appeared to have a wait as there were quite a few people waiting outside.    We were a party of 2 and waited about 15 mins to be seated.  That wasn't bad, but WHERE we were seated was HORRIBLE. It was a tiny little table in what felt like the middle of the lobby.  It was the first table right inside the door so everyone waiting is in your face staring and the constant door swinging made it quite chilly. Yuck!   I opened the menu and was greeted by a lack of choices.  Super disappointing. So the menu was disappointing, I hated were we were seated and then the really nice server brings us water and iced tea in these TINY glasses.  That was enough for me.  We left.    Now we are at The Oink instead, about 10 mins away and MUCH MUCH happier.",

Both places are extremely overpriced for sub par to below average food. I started going to Matts since it was closer to my current building and ever since I started going, I've only received medicore food and rude interactions with Jason the manager. Anyone who works with state farm is to go through the take out only section of the restaurant. We are not allowed to sit and eat inside because \"customers may ask about your employee meal\" and \"you ordered take out, so take out.\" So outdoor seating is our only option.   I've tried squirting myself some ketchup in one of the plastic cups they have at the register for my meal and Jason stood next to me repeating \"stop that, don't do that\" and I have no idea who hes talking to until I look up. He told me that ketchup is $4 a bottle and he could get me a prefilled togo container if I asked. I apologized and thanked him and he said nothing while taking the container of ketchup away. Today, I ordered from their discounted menu for state farm employees (not sure why this is such a secret that paying customers cannot sit and eat inside) and it took 20 mins for the most half assed slider set ive ever received in my life. While waiting, I also noticed Jason pouring kettle chips from an actual store bought bag into orders. Nice. The meat was burnt and just plain horrible. I will not be spending my money here again.   Also while waiting, another coworker ordered a burrito and asked for something not to be in it due to allergy and apparently he sent it back to be remade. Jason then called him up to the register and infront of everyone told him that it was just egg and nothing else was inside while holding the dismantled burrito for proof. The customer then pointed out the other unwanted ingredient and then the manager finally agreed to make a new one. Embarrassing.",

I had eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast, and my meal was delicious and fueled me into much of the afternoon. You can tell that the ingredients here are fresh. The slices of bacon were thick, and the bread from which my toast slices were cut was made that morning.   The entrance to the restaurant is located within the State Farm complex, with a few parking spots available directly in front of the restaurant. We walked from the AC Hotel along the bike path. Our service was friendly and quick. When we travel and eat out, we try to explore as many different restaurants as possible, but this place was so good we were both tempted to have breakfast here again!",

At least now they have more seating.   The food has always been great, but the line is always way too long. When we were there last, people were piling into the cashier area waiting inside because of the warm weather. They packed into the restaurant and crowded around us at the front counter. I definitely didn't like the feeling of people hovering over us while we ate. Some were even rude enough to be leaning on the counter that we were eating on. Overall not an enjoyable experience.  I like the overall vibe of the restaurant and the food, but because of the lines, I'd opt for another breakfast spot. The Valley has plenty of other amazing breakfast/brunch spots.",

The place was packed, so I wasn't surprised. Because it was so cold, everyone was crowded in waiting in the small reception area in the front, but it's Arizona so that can't happen that often.   I got the Five Spot, and when it was coming out, I saw how much bread it was and the \"oh no\" thoughts were running through my head. But all those thoughts disappeared when I tried it. The bread melted in my mouth and wasn't heavy at all. The bacon and onions on the sandwich were fantastic. My mom got the Salami Scramble, which I tried and the salami was very tasty.   Service was great and everything came out quick and hot.  My brother was the only one who got coffee and said it wasn't that great, but he drank a couple cups, so it couldn't have been that bad.   I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "This was one of the worst breakfast experiences we have ever had at a restaurant.  There were so many issues that it's hard to know where to begin.  I guess it all started with a dirty water cup.  Hubby ordered water and I got freshly squeezed OJ.  The water cup had food residue all over it and there was also something floating in the water.  As we were waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, we observed servers giving food to the wrong people on multiple occasions.  We know that we were waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, because I checked in on Yelp right after we ordered so we had a time stamp as a reference.  We also observed the manager scold a server in the middle of the dining room.  The server was visibly mad at him.  When our food came out, the server gave it to the people next to us while we were trying to tell him that it was ours.  It was very obvious that servers did not know table numbers because so many people were given the wrong food.   Hubby and I both ordered the scramble special with Havarti cheese, sausage and spinach.  When we got the food, the eggs were severely overcooked.  There was no cheese in mine nor my husband's scramble.  The potatoes, which I took some photos of, were so charred that it looked like there were chunks of coal in them.  My husband sent his plate back because it was so bad.  When the manager brought out the newly cooked plate of food for him, he tossed it down in front of my husband and said \"Here ya go, dude.\"  NO apology, no nothing.   I have never seen such apathy from a restaurant manager before.    The kitchen was obviously in the weeds the entire time we were there.  There seems to be a huge training issue that spans from the kitchen to management, to the servers.  I think this location has bitten off much more than they can chew.  It's giving MBB a bad reputation.  I have written hundereds of reviews, and I very rarely give a one star review.  MBB earned that one star.",

For some reason they have a huge patio that is used as a waiting area instead of set up for service. We waited 45 mins to be seated for a table of 3 and multiple times during that time I witnessed tables cleared and ready to be sat to have the manager who was calling guests let the table sit empty for 10 to 15 minutes. The food and Bloody Mary I had was pretty good but not good enough to make up for the aggravation of inefficiency and having to spend 2 hours for a breakfast that would of taken an hour tops anywhere else.",

Because it's such a pain to get to this location, we stuck it out to finally try this fabled restaurant. I ordered the Friday special, basically a deconstructed breakfast burrito, and my lady ordered the hog and chick, sausage and potatoes and scrambled eggs. The food was okay, and the price was comparable to any other yuppie brunch spot that feels the need to advertise things like \"cage-free\". The mimosa was alright, but the Gin Rickey was made with a lemon instead of a lime. Overall they seemed under staffed. Will not be returning, but I don't think I'll need to.

The food is delicious, the service is fantastic, and it has, in my opinion, the most delicious breakfast served anywhere. I'm so happy they've expanded to Tempe.  I would recommend The Chop and Chick as a great place to get a sampling of savory heaven. The pork chop is seasoned perfectly and is a perfect example of being tender yet firm. The eggs are always sublime, and the home fries will never disappoint.  If you've got a sweet tooth, the pancakes or the waffle are also delicious. I'd kill for their batter recipe.  Will continue to keep coming back for more",

The location is part of the Rio Salado complex on Tempe Town Lake.  Very beautiful day and location.  Parking was interesting, only because 2 out of the 3 of us are gimpy.  So while there, I asked how to park closer and that was very helpful.      Our server was Daniel.  If I could hire someone, it would be Daniel in a heartbeat!  He was kind, thoughtful, friendly and there for everything we needed.  The coffee...  well, I loved it!  It is hearty and isn't the watered-down version of coffee that most places serve.  (\"Roastery of Cave Creek. Ground daily.\")       Two of us had \"The Hog & Chick\" with 2 eggs, toast, hash browns or homefries, and meat.  I had it scrambled, white toast, sausage patties and hash browns.  It was perfection plus strawberry preserves!  Everyone ate everything!  Our friend had the waffle and bacon... the first words out of her mouth were \"OH MY GOD!\" after her bite of bacon.  She kept looking at it and chewing and she could not believe it was that good.  All of us loved loved loved the meal and the attentiveness of Daniel.       I must also mention the person that cooked our great breakfast, Forest!  I met him at the counter and I must give hats off to the person who hired these guys!  Forest did a great job, because each of us wanted to lick our plates.      We will be back.",

So, we decided to sit at the bar, ever place I've ever been the bar is open, we sat down, looked at the menu only but a second and a mar came up to us very loudly and said \"there are two people in front of you, you can't sit here\". Mind you there were several tables open and the two people in front of us had been sitting there waiting. Was very unprofessional to announce it like that and since when is the bar part of seating? I'll avoid this place and take my business elsewhere, I understand this might be minor, but when there are multiple places open and you disrespect customers, it's never ok.",

    "text": "I would like to share my recent experience dining at this establishment.  To give you a bit of background, I found Matt's Big Breakfast off Yelp months ago and my sister and I visited the location they have in downtown Phoenix.  I read the reviews and although most people spoke about the long wait time, but how worth it to still visit, was definitely something worth trying out.  I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the breakfast that I had (salami scramble w/cheese, side of sausage and home fries ...bomb.com)  I've visited that location twice and never had a problem.  Recently I was visiting my sister in the East Valley of Phoenix and she began craving Matt's Big Breakfast.  I said, Ok...let's do it.  To my surprise they have a new location that opened up about 10 months ago (I was told) and we were excited about trying it out.  Here are the Pro's and Con's:  Pro's:  This location is much bigger than the location downtown.  I loved the scenery, the waterfall and the outside seating.  I absolutely love the open kitchen which allows you to watch your food being made.  Our server Michelle was AMAZING (more details about her in a bit).  Con's:  We were served our drinks in plastic cups and not glasses like everyone else.  My sister elected to order the Steak and Eggs breakfast, but she could not because they ran out of steak.  It would have been nice to know this information when we were given our menus to look over.  It's on the menu, so how come you don't have it available for a customer to purchase?  She then selected home fries, cheesy eggs and 3 pancakes.  She did not like the pancakes.  I again ordered my usual, salami scramble with home fries and side of sausage.  My home fries came out cold.  I asked the waiter if they could give me some more and they used a top broiler of some kind to heat it up because they do not have a microwave.  When our server Michelle came by to ask how our food was, I told her that it was just alright, nothing special.  After telling her what was wrong, she immediately took my plate away without further request and had them remake the whole meal.  She explained to me that my happiness is what matters to her and that is what I call some damn good customer service.  When my plate arrived, my potatoes were hot, cheese melted on my salami scramble.  That remake, but most importantly her eagerness to satisfy me is what allowed me to give this place a 2 star.  I hoped that my experience would have been better because this location is close to my job and I would have planned to visit more.  Would I go again, probably not.  I would travel to the downtown location if I ever crave Matt's again.  I hope that one day I can update my review with something much better for this location if I do visit again  They seem to be new and getting things together so I won't bash them for that.  I wish them the best and hope it gets better.",

After looking over the menu which seemed pretty limited I had made up my mind that I'd just enjoy the amazing coffee at Matt's and opt for a short ride to Snooze instead for food. I let Michelle know that nothing really stood out so I'd take my check for the coffee. She said with a warm smile \"Is there something you were looking for? I'm sure we can make you happy!\" I told  her I was a fan of a skillet type of breakfast. She immediately said she could do that and started making recommendations on what to include in it. Just seemed to genuinely care about making me happy with a great breakfast which kicked my Friday off perfectly. Off-menu skillet was great Michelle! Matt's lucky to have you:)",

We sat at the table outside for about 15 min before being told we had to get our names on the wait list.... so we did and the wait was long. We were finally seated inside and they don't have much variety so we ordered and my companion got a side of hash browns that came out looking like green ramen noodles. The food was mediocre and the server was getting really friendly with my companion. Wasn't terrible but wasn't great, I probably wouldn't go back",

The Bacon was excellent and the waffle was nice and crisp.   The reason for the 2 star rating was related to the \"Big\" reference.  I had different expectations obviously.  So I ordered eggs on the side, 4 to be exact.  I asked the waitress for some more syrup for my waffle as the portion served was meager to be kind.  It was explained that it came from Vermont so I was only getting the portion that was previously provided but I could have blueberry preserves if I wanted something else.  I asked the cost of more syrup and I opted to try the Blueberry preserves.  I don't remember the exact quoted amount but it seemed excessive as my check was already just shy of $20.00 and that is just drinking water.    For what it is worth the location and convenience was great.  The food was tasty and the waitress was great.  I was just expecting more from \"Big\" breakfast.",

I'm a fan of the Phoenix location but this one is perfect for a bike ride along Tempe Town Lake and nestled among the beauty of Marina Heights. Once inside, it's sleek and modern with colorful chalk drawings displaying. I like the short menu so you aren't overloaded on those hangover mornings. There are a variety of specials each day of the week but I stuck to the waffles....something about those airy pillows of carb goodness had me. If the freshly brewed STRONG coffee from the Roastery of Cave Creek doesn't perk you up, the bellini and margarita are pretty delish good eye openers. Just a note, there's few 5 tops (3 to be exact) so not the easiest to accommodate large parties. You MUST have all people present to be seated. Or if you can squeeze in, sit at the bar and gab with a few Sun Devils. The waiting area is spacious on the outdoor patio that you can stalk the diners to hurry and finish up! Parking is pretty easy and they will validate for the garage. And if you've overindulged, just walk steps to the gym across the yard or take a quick run around the lake.",

I'm a bit of a breakfast snob so when the kids and wife pressure me to go to Denny's, I turn up my nose and refuse to be a party to such heathenism. I ordered the chop and chick. The eggs were undercooked (wife and I ordered over medium)I made due because the toast was no lie, 2\" thick, so I had plenty of real estate to mop up the runny whites and yolk. The pork chop was good, but I really enjoyed the home fries which much to my surprise were grilled up with fresh rosemary. Don't get the hash browns you will be disappointed. The family wasn't impressed by the thick cut locally farm raised bacon or the cage free eggs, or the fresh squeezed orange juice. Hell even the ketchup was non GMO. Oh well... On to the next, I refuse to give into the big breakfast corporate juggernauts.",

I have nothing good to say about our visit today, except our waitress was friendly and apologetic about the \"food\" we were served. We both ordered the special today, eggs benedict, being today's special you'd think they'd have it down. No. Such. Luck. My plate was FULL of water that my food swam around in. My potatoes swimming and cold, the hollandaise was cool and thick, my eggs hard boiled. My wife's plate was about the same, just a little less water, her hash browns dry and tasteless. We shared our concerns with our server who told us she would speak to the manager, she then comped our main dishes...We never spoke to the manager. My guess is they don't care all that much. On the way out we were already nauseous and my wife went to use the filthy, unstocked ladies room with the broken door to add insult to injury I suppose. I guess the positive ratings come from employees?? I'll go to Denny's before Matt's sees a nickle of my hard earned cash.",

Waited about 30 minutes.   Service was meh. She greeted us quick but not friendly. Kept up on water refills but didn't check on us too much after we got our food.   We waited about 20-25 minutes for our food. Boyfriend ordered the special which was a three egg scramble with pork tenderloin, Fresno peppers and Cabot white cheddar served with a tortilla and home fries. He requested home fries extra crispy and they came out super soft. There were two tiny pieces of the Fresno peppers in the scramble and the pork tenderloin was roughly chopped into large pieces with little to no flavor. Pretty bland.   I ordered the five spot with a side of hash browns. Both of mine were absolutely delicious but very greasy. They may have confused the \"crispy\" request for my hash browns but they turned out great.   Took a while for our server to get us our check and a box. Bathroom was out of paper towels. Overall just not a great experience. I'll definitely return but either during the week or earlier on the weekend.",

The food was mediocre at best, not even as good as an omelette you might order at a Denny's or IHOP.  They brought us over coffee as soon as we sat, without asking if we wanted it (at first we thought this was a nice gesture, until two coffees popped up on our bill later).  For a breakfast joint located in Arizona, the hottest salsa they have is Tapatio- they don't even carry Chiluba or Tabasco for heavens sake (sacrilegious in my book).  Also, I must say that the menu was quite small; I felt that there were very few options, it was almost too easy to decide which entree to order.",

I expected to at least have a short wait since I'd heard how popular Matt's is.  We went out for lunch knowing we'd have breakfast. Service was good but I was underwhelmed with the selection. Yeah, I know, it's breakfast. My egg sandwich was just average as well. My colleagues' meals looked good and maybe I just made the wrong choice. I'm not sure I'd try this place again. If we're in the area, maybe.   Tip: for those not working in one of the buildings at this location, there is parking just north of Matt's don't try this before attempting to park in the structure. We happened to luck out.",

    "text": "Matt loves Big Breakfasts and he cannot lie.  (You other brothers can't deny) --Rejected Sir Mix a Lot lyrics  I've had Matt's bookmarked for a long time and had the morning off so we decided to try this spot out. The restaurant is in a commercial building complex almost exclusively consisting of State Farm Insurance around the Tempe Town Lake area. Parking was easier than I thought. Once you enter the Marina Heights garage there's a sign that tells you where customers can park, and the garage offers your first two hours of parking for free.   Once you get to the restaurant there's a takeout entrance and the regular entrance. The regular entrance is a bit weird in that you have to go through the patio to enter the front door.   I had the scramble daily special. It consisted of fluffy eggs, leaf spinach, lightly sweet Niman Ranch apple chicken sausage, and Havarti cheese. You have your choice of potato and toast- I chose home fries and sourdough. The home fries were perfectly seasoned and delicious. I also enjoyed the sourdough toast.  I had a bite of the salami scramble with hash browns. The salami was cut in long chunky strips and tasted good with the eggs. The hash browns were nice and crispy but were waaay overseasoned. It was too salty for my tastes and when we flipped the pile of hash browns over we noticed that the entire bottom portion was totally coated with their salt/pepper mix which explains the overseasoning.   Prices were reasonable for the quality of food we got. I appreciate that they use sustainable and more humanely raised meats, and that to go boxes are in compostable containers.  So if you're in the Tempe Town Lake area and want breakfast, at Matt's, this Breakfast Got Back!",

    "text": "I would really, really like to give Matt's more stars, but this place just doesn't do it for me (and trust me - I've been back three times in hopes of a better experience!).   Ambiance: Great! Trendy and modern, and the Marina Heights scenery is GORGEOUS! But...I wish they utilized the space a bit better. We're in the peak of patio/outdoor seating in Phoenix, and Matt's enormous patio continues to go unused with no tables or outdoor seating options!   Food: Standard. It's really good, simple fare. But...I could make it in my own kitchen (that's how simple it is). They use fresh ingredients that are sustainably sourced, so I have peace of mind there, but the menu is limited, and again - I could make lots of what they serve at home in under ten minutes.   Service: ...wish it was better. It's not that the servers are rude (and again, we've been three times, so I've seen a decent sample of what's to offer), but they don't always feel the most hospitable. I've gone long lengths of time with an empty water glass or coffee cup, and find myself flagging down waitstaff to add items to my tab. I've seen food delivered to the wrong table multiple times, and overall, just don't see the service team working well together.   So, the wrap-up is that this is a great place to try if you're not on a budget and are in the mood for a simple, no-frills breakfast meal. Expect to wait a little, spend a bit, and walk away satisfied but not blown away. Could be a great place to stop if you're taking a stroll on ASU's Tempe Campus or in the Marina Heights neighborhood and are wanting a bite!",

They source only the best ingredients. The food is SO good. I always get the classic Hog and Chick. I typically don't eat bacon, but their bacon is so thick and well seasoned.

The food here is really good, the atmosphere is awesome and the location is prime! The only reason why Matt's Big Breakfast didn't get their fifth star is because honestly the service isn't good.

Went to get our drinks and another friendly young lady came by for our drink order!!  Love this!! Better to have too much attention then none!!  Iced tea was amazing.  Husband ordered a cheese omelette with home fries ( caramelized onions and rosemary) and a cup of chili.  I ordered the waffle that comes with Pepper bacon. Omelette came out with hash browns.... oops.... quick fix. Boom they are back with the wonderful potato's!  Food was Amazing . Service outstanding!

We went 45 minutes before closing and were immediately seated! Our food came out pretty quickly and was fairly good.  My waffle was decent and my eggs were really good. I asked for the cheese to be mixed in while cooking but I think it's a concept restaurants here can't grasp. Despite me specifically asking for it to be mixed in and not on top, it always ends up that way. I asked for my hash brown to be fried hard, and it was, but only on the outside. The inside of my hash brown was extremely mushy with the consistency of  mashed potatoes (which is my all time least favorite food). My hubs ordered the pancakes and I gave him the bacon that came with my dish. He was able to work his way through most of it but they were really big. Something to consider if your get full fast like me.  Overall, this is a cute restaurant with great service. Just stay away from the hash browns if you hate mashed potatoes.",

I am vegetarian for the most part and I'm the only one I know that hates bacon (I know, I know). So after I told our waitress my food restrictions, she suggested the hash w/veggies with an egg on top. YUM! We also had a stack of their pancakes with real maple syrup. They were delicious! The service was great--our very attentive waitress, Michelle, made sure our order and our checks were correct (we were in a group of 7 people and we split checks).  Minus a star because a busser took our pancake plate before we could down the last bites. Maybe they are inexperienced at it and didn't realize they should just ask, \"hey, can i take your plate?\" Other than the over-eager bussers, the staff was nice, chairs and table were comfortable, our waitress was awesome, and the food was delicious!",

So I finally stuck it out and waited, and boy was I underwhelmed.   Once seated, our server took almost 15 minutes to get to our table. When she did finally greet our table, she didn't say anything but hi before walking off again. Didn't ask us what we want to drink or anything.   When we did order, I got the five spot. It was really, really greasy. Additionally, my friend who ordered \"extra crispy\" hashbrowns got soggy fries instead. It was just upsetting because we had waited close to an hour to get in, and then the service was lackluster and the food was subpar.   I will say that their jam and toast was delicious, and my friend enjoyed her coffee. However, I think there are better places to spend your weekend morning than at Matt's Big Breakfast.",

My daughter and a friend came in to join us toward the end of our breakfast...we asked if a chair could be added to our table...manager said no...very loudly and drawing attention to our table, that they could not join our party bc it wouldn't be fair to those who had been waiting.  We asked for a chair so she could sit with us. We understood the reason why she couldn't order, but his grandstanding in the restaurant was impolite & unprofessional.  After upsetting my daughter, my wife went to speak to him about how he handled the situation...rather than hear our concern regarding how he embarrassed a teenaged customer with his grandstanding, he proceeded to argue his point and justify his actions...he finally relented and offered an apology.  Fast forward 4 days, same teenaged daughter goes to breakfast w friends.  One of the party drops the check tray and it breaks....same manager gets upset and asks if the young lady had $32 to pay for the broken check tray...not joking, not playing around, but with the same arrogant and impatient attitude displayed just 4 days prior.  The place has great food and the service has been good each time we visited Matt's.  But this one manager's attitude, arrogance, and actions will keep us from visiting the Tempe location in the future.",

I did some work and went to get my breakfast. The loud mouthed host who took my order did several rounds of coffee to the guests before greeting me. I stood at the counter for a good 5-10 minutes. No apology when he did, only wanted my name and money. I proceeded to wait patiently for another 20 minutes two people behind me ordered and were served. The host/manger then asked me for my name again and checked the takeout shelf. It had been sitting there the whole time. When I got back to my desk the food was cold. Not worth the $13 for the special. This is the last time I go and I haven't been impressed with the place since it opened. Support another breakfast joint and avoid this location.",

It has a nice vibe and a welcoming hello when you walk in. I had the Tuesday Special, biscuits and gravy with eggs and home fries plus I had a side of bacon. My daughter had the Hog and Chick (eggs, sausage patties, hash browns and toast). The biscuits and gravy was the best I've ever had, the bacon was delicious, I don't normally like sausage but the sausage was amazing, the hash browns and home fries were perfect, the toast is apparently delivered daily and it's wonderful. Oh, and the fresh squeezed OJ and lemonade was actually FRESH SQUEEZED! Our server was great and the managers were all friendly and made sure our visit was perfect!  I will definitely be back, especially on Tuesday's for the biscuits and gravy.",

The host guy was funny to watch, but not at all effective in getting tables turned and seated, and seems to believe his low level job gives him a pass to be rude to customers. I'm fairly sure they intentionally stretch out the wait to create a False sense of demand and hype.  There were always 3-4 empty tables while cranky people waited as if at the DMV.  The food is fine, service is a bit awkward and certainly nothing worth putting up with their complete lack of urgency.  It makes customers upset to feel like there's no priority in taking care of them.  Hospitality 101 failure.",

    "text": "Just a forewarning, this place is not bad by any means. It serves good food. Is it remarkable, or memorable? I would say no. If you are looking for a decent meal, at a clean place, with good service, this will suffice. The following review items pin point the food and some things to consider.   I've been here twice: for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast I had the biscuits and gravy, which also came with two eggs and hash browns. For lunch I had the hickory burger with mac salad instead of fries.   The biscuits and gravy was not bad. But be warned. It is not a plate for small stomachs. It's priced at around $11, which seems fair for the food. But in my opinion, biscuits and gravy in and of itself is the meal, and the eggs and browns are overkill. The gravy was a bit too peppery for my taste, the biscuit was near perfect. The egg and hash brown were...egg and hash brown. They have their browns done more on the crispy side, which I also prefer. All in all, I would get it again, but maybe split it with someone else.   The hickory burger was lackluster. The patty was done as I had asked, but a bit dry. The bun was golden and crispy on the outside, but quite dry in the middle. The bun sort dried everything out as you ate, which wasn't pleasant. The BBQ sauce was nice, but the cheese was negligible; and it was shredded. Who puts shredded cheese on a burger?? The sweet onions were diced. Again, who puts diced onions on a burger?? Both travesties. Slice of cheese, and whole onion slices are meant for burgers, it can't be changed. The Mac salad was meh. Dry, and not much flavor other than a step up from just plain pasta. At $17 for the meal, it definitely hurt paying the bill.   The place is clean, the staff are pleasant and quick. No complaints there.   Overall, it's a gamble. But good location, staff, and venue will have me coming back till I find something memorable.",

The aforementioned hard to find waitress brings $5.  Have to flag down the waitress again to tell her change is a dollar short (yes, I know it's not a lot of money but by this time I'm fit to be tied).  Waitress makes some comment about not doing change.  I have no idea what she's talking about but  I know if I go with a follow up question my head will explode.  She leaves and comes back with my dollar (yes, I still know it's not a lot of money).  I have no idea what this whole bill paying ordeal was about, but this quite frankly, is one of the most irritating things to happen in a restaurant in quite some time.  If they have some sort of weird store policy about handling or not handling change, that would be a good data point to tell people about.  As for the food... - Eggs good - Hash browns good - Bacon good, but they really could have done a WAAAAYYYYY better job of getting the grease off the bacon. - Toast good, but I really don't get why MBB does one slice of a thicker cut toast.",

    "text": "Pending an influx of Arizona breakfast venue reviews, I ought to elevate my rating of Matt's Big Breakfast to 5 stars. Allow me to explain:   My previous review, although thorough, factored only situational blemishes in my overall Matt's experience. Given that every Arizonan restaurant I have since visited consistently does not compare to Matt's in terms of quality of food, value, location, and service, I declare Matt's the bar thus set. All others, unless proven otherwise, fare underneath.   In addition, since my previous review, I should give credit to Matt's for getting more creative with their rotating scrambles (I am seeing chorizo less often, so perhaps the surplus has at last worn out). I have also been pleased to have tried the Eggs Benedict (Thursday special) -- an excellent choice to be sure. However, my staple continues to be the cheese omelet with peppers, mushrooms, bacon, and the unbeatable home fries.   If I didn't live within walking distance to the Marina Heights location, I would have probably tried the Phoenix one by now. Soon, soon. Perhaps even the Sky Harbor one if I have an early morning flight to catch.   So, there you have it in the meantime! See you this weekend.",

Yes, I'm using the word fabulous because that's how good the ones you see this. I believe it's freshly squeezed orange juice that they make right there but you may want to check with the server to verify.  My lady ordered and on the omelette.

What I learnt about this place is that their eggs are cage free and ingredients are locally sourced from Arizona- a big thumbs up.  I ordered the Special Scramble that Saturday morning and paired it with a mimosa. Our entire table ordered mimosas and were told that the orange juice was freshly squeezed, which I definitely could tell in the taste.

The flavor on that chop was amazing. He had it with country potatoes and scrambled eggs. He enjoyed it so much. I had the hog and chick. It came with 3 pieces of thick bacon, hashbrowns, and my over easy eggs. Bacon was different. It isn't the thin slices like any other breakfast places you've been to.. This bacon is nice, tasty, thick, soft as you chew it, and crunchy on the ends. It wasn't't salty neither which was perfect.  I also had 2 of their mimosas! Mmmm so good. I love this place. Awesome service too! Well the bartender was because we sat at the bar to eat since it was super packed. The other chick, I forgot her name but when I asked for ketchup she kind of gave me an attitude. Good thing the food and bartender made up for it.   But hands down! This is the best breakfast place in my opinion in AZ!!",

    "text": "We always thought Matt's Big Breakfast was mediocre, but we decided to give it another chance at this location (that we've never been to before) - our fault!  If you like anything listed below, come here!  * Disarray. Playing musical chairs on where to be seated; or Goldilocks trial and error; or third time's a charm--literally--to be seated...  * Dirty Tables. Saw a couple servers just standing around chit chatting.  * Dirty mugs. Big bright red lipstick stain that's easy to see unless your head is someplace else)--the server blamed the lipstick being probably one of the 24 hr. ones. Mind you, I used to be a server and I always checked the plates and silverware beforehand.  * Rubbery, extremely oily eggs and veggies. Less than mediocre than what I remembered it to be.  * Half-undercooked, half-burnt potatoes/home-fries  * Listening to the chef yell he needs a plate and that someone needs to \"hurry\". If you read some of the yelp reviews (which we should've done beforehand) they include burnt burgers or potatoes--now I know why...  * Not receiving our waffle to share. The server blamed the guy who was serving the food, but later realized it was her fault because she never put it in.  Didn't think it was worth waiting for it, especially since it was such a task for our server to attend to us. We had to flag her down to get us utensils, napkins, fill our waters and coffee... It almost seemed she tried to avoid us, maybe because of embarrassment of our unpleasant experience from the get-go.  * Being overcharged $1 more (but wanted to get out ASAP so we didn't think it worth to change)  * Paying for it all as if it was at a 5-star restaurant...ok maybe exaggerating, but I expect to at least get decent food if they're gonna charge the way they do...  I'm not one to write a bad review, unless it absolutely bothers me. When you pay for a service or an experience, you at least expect it to not leave you with such exasperation.  We definitely won't be coming back.",

The staff was great and friendly! My mom got a glass of water, and it stunk. It smelled like eggs and that shoed that it wasn't washed well. We told our waitress  about it and she quickly fixed fixed that issue. Then the food was great! But my mom wasn't able to finish her food so she ordered a box for her omelette. She went to put her food in the box and under the omelette there was hair!! Needless to say if we knew that she wouldn't have ate it. My biggest issue was how I believe the manager reacted. He was nice but asked if the hair was there before we ate the food, he kind of nudged at the fact that we were lying but we weren't.  I love the place and I hope this is a solo occurrence.",

My husband ordered the greens and beans bowl with chicken.  It also came with a poached eggs. He found it to be a little lacking in flavor. That being said, he appreciated the healthier option.   Toast is served as two thick cut slices. It is also served with house made jam. Different jams are served with different types of toast. Sourdough is served with blackberry jam. The jam was jam packed with fruit. If I would have known, I would have ordered a side of jam to go with my pancakes. It seriously looked like a fruit compote.  Server seemed confused. I am not sure if it was because we were a big group, or they just were.   Something to note, menu is on the small side. There also are no children's options. There are ala carte options. We created a smaller meal for our youngest with that.",

I actually left without ordering due to its absurd pricing. LIke Ritz Carlton room service pricing. (Ive ordered room service from the Ritz, I know what that costs) To feed my two little kids and myself breakfast would have been about $50 with tip.     Three pancakes. $7.95  Yes. You read that right. I'm not sure if they have retired US Presidents making them but $8 for three pancakes that cost 3 cents to make seems a bit steep.  Glass of OJ= $4.95  Made from oranges. NOT made from oranges harvested by Angels mind you.  Soda, one brand in a can. NO refills. $2.00 (RC Cola. I didn't even know that they were still in business. Who drinks that crap?) I could go on...  No kids menu. Annoying. NO regualr fountain drinks. Annoying. Absurd pricing. Annoying. Amazing staff. WONDERFUL!

I ordered the pork chop with 2 overhard eggs, home fries with rosemary, and wheat toast with a side of berry jam.  The bottomless coffee was very good especially with the small tin of milk versus creamer provided.  The rosemary was prevalent in the pork chop that was perfectly cooked and succulent in taste.  Speaking of succulent, there was also a succulent as a table decoration that added a touch of Arizona.  The highlight was the addition of thick cut bacon I ordered to compliment my meal, which were 3 apple smoked and peppered pieces that were so crispy and flavorful, I wanted to hug Matt and thankfully say \"now this is how bacon should taste!\"  This organic farm to table type establishment was an excellent representation of what a modern breakfast in Arizona should taste like and worth eating on a placeMatt;)",

Now for the food!   Me: The Five Spot, 2 eggs real butter cage free, 2 ridiculously thick pieces of suculant bacon, Wisconsin cheddar on a hand made roll! This thing was 5 bucks... Get real! I'd show you if I didnt eat it too fast!.  Wife: Cheese Ommlett: honestly we didnt speak the entire meal nor have time to look at each other's plates; too concentrated and focused on each and ever bite!

The best of all was The Classic Reuben, Just amazing combinations of flavors that I absolutely loved! Their waffles look very good too but I just had no room to try it... The rash browns are made in a very particular way, I also loved it!  I recommend this place!",

    "text": "Used to be a alright place when they opened but they had a horrible dip in quality recently and so now I will try to avoid this place.  I ordered a Cobb salad like i usually do and its typically decked out with olives, 1 to 2 eggs sliced in, blue cheese scattered through out, a big piece grilled chicken laying on top, dressing, lot of their bacon chopped in and freshly sliced tomatoes.  Well I think they have switched to more of a fast food format because when I went there for lunch like usual and ordered it again, I was baffled and thought at first I got the wrong order so I went back and returned it because it just looked like plain piled on lettuce with dressing mixed in, the person working at the front noticed too and said it may have been due to a new employee so had it redone. So I brought to try and eat it again as he assured me that he saw it get made this time and it was done correctly.  And it wasnt, it was disgusting. The chicken was diced and kinda tasted like cold packaged white chicken that was just poured at the bottom, and not much of it at that maybe like 2 fork fulls if I were to attempt to stab every little squared diced piece.  The tomatoes were now also diced and again like 2 fork fulls worth tasted like they were again just bought pre done at a grocery store although there was so little mixed in it was hard to tell. No olives. A single chunk of cheese not spread throughout probably about the size of a quarter. Half of an egg sliced into 3 sections sitting on top of the salad. 2 Teaspoons of crumbled bacon. And a whole lot of romaine lettuce. And 2 packages of dressing on the side.  Like what the heck happened o.o how does a place go downhill that fast. I could understand a cheap $2 premade side salad being like that but not a main menu item that im paying $11 for on a salad. I didnt go back to return it a 2nd time as apparently this is just the quality of the food they serve now and the guy that works the register at the front is just always so nice that itd be kinda weird to cause a stink over this again as I know it wasnt his fault its prepared like that now. Oh well. :/",

Everything from the peppers, eggs, bacon and coffee grounds are all locally sourced and as fresh as it gets. The icing on the cake for me was the bacon, one of the thickest cuts I've ever received at a restaurant and the flavor was out of this world. Highly recommend trying this place out, no doubt you'll be a returning customer!",

I wasnt too impressed with the food at all.  I ended up ordering a waffle.  It came with bacon, which was so burnt I didnt eat it.  The waffle was \"ok\", nothing to write home about.  My dining partners had a reuben sandwich and a chicken sandwich, both of which they said were good.  The ONLY redeeming quality about our visit was the staff--everyone was very friendly and offered a smile.  I still havent figured what is so BIG about Matt's Breakfast, and after our visit, I dont intend on finding out.",

I was in Phoenix for spring training with a large group of friends and our kids. We were going to an afternoon game and wanted to take the kids to breakfast first. We had heard good things about Matt's big breakfast so decided to check it out. The staff was extremely accommodating, offering plenty of different options for a group our size. In the end we decided the best option would be to split up into separate tables. The moment I sat down, we were greeted by a friendly server who immediately brought us a waffle. I explained that I didn't order one, to which she replied with a smile \"I know\". We had been having a rough morning after driving for 12 hours straight so this was exactly what I needed. Within another minute, the manager came by and asked if we would like chocolate milks for the kids. We ordered an omelette, griddle cakes, breakfast potatoes, and waffles. Everything was amazing. The omelette was made in the traditional style with the eggs cooked so perfectly that there was no brown, the filling were in the middle then dried out and cooked into the eggs. The potatoes were cooked perfectly crispy and tender at the same time. The waffle came with a side of delicious house made strawberry preserves. Thank you to Matt's big breakfast for starting off our trip on an amazing note!",

    "text": "Meh.   I was excited to try this place because my friend loved it last time she came but it wasn't worth it to me. For $60 on brunch I'd expect better service to be honest.  The place wasn't busy at all and our sever never checked on us. We're halfway through meal and champagne glasses are bone dry and our server brings us our bill stating no rush... to me when I'm still eating and the bill is brought that is rushing me out. We were there around 130 which they still had an hour to close so idk why we were being pushed out so fast. We asked for another drink and our server acted like he didn't wanna work anymore. We said thank you and he's like mhm, crumples the bill he originally brought to add extra drink and walks away. I'm sorry, but adding more drinks to bill raises the bill which means more tip.   The food was pretty good. I had the skinny eggs and it was a good portion for the price. I'm all about service though and this place fell short of that. The manager was checking on table but never came to us. The manager came to our table to take my card to pay, and I said oh it's already paid I need to just sign and he drops card and walks off.. doesn't say anything. Kind of odd  I live in north Phoenix and drove to Tempe cause my friend said it was worth it but I don't think so. The service was meh and the food was alright. Not worth the drive tho so this will be the place that I skip next time.",

I ended up getting the five spot breakfast sandwich and my girlfriend got a omelet with veggies since there weren't any vegan options. Overall the food was good, simple, and inexpensive. It is more of a casual atmosphere so expect it to be a bit loud and quite busy at times. If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive breakfast this might be your spot.",

    "text": "My previous experience was very pleasant but today I changed my mind. I sat at the bar solo, one waiter takes my drink order then disappears. Another waitress takes my food order then disappears. A different waitress comes to me and asks how the food was. That's messed up. Who should I tip? And besides that, their attitudes (all of them) are careless and distracted. I didn't even dare to approach the issue that my pork chop steak was tough and insipid. Not only the steak but also the scramble eggs were flavorless, hash browns so oily... I truly exclusively enjoyed the sourdough bread with the handmade jelly and the orange juice. That's why I give 2 stars instead of 1. I read the story on the back of the menu of how proud the owner is to feature quality of food and organic, local-grown products and bla bla bla. But where's the quality? I'm a foodie, I want to eat well. What you gave me this morning was very ordinary, at best. There's a lot of competition in this town due to the fact that there are so many breakfast places. You must give your customers something that will make them come back to you. Otherwise, from now on, big red cross on Matt's Big Breakfast.",

Ordered toast and their homemade preserves and that was excellent as well. Probably one of the best waffles I've had in some times. The waffle also came with bacon, which was thick cut and tasted excellent. I'll be back!  5 stars for customer service 4 stars for their food quality  5 stars for their restaurant cleanliness 3 stars for their location (parking building)",

    "text": "I love a good breakfast place on the weekend but...I don't like to drive (and sometimes I don't have time to catch the light rail from Tempe to Downtown) so though I love Matt's Big Breakfast, my culinary dalliances with this well known establishment were sadly, few and far between.  However, to use a cliche, as Mohammad did not want to take the time to get to the mountain, the mountain has come to Mohammad with an extension of this chain right near ASU in the buildup of State Farm and many other places along Rio Salado. As such, I set up a breakfast date with friends, put on my hoodie (it's chilly early on a January morning folks) and peddled over to this location, and it lovely!  Nestled amid a delightful little corporate park, with plenty of space for tables and a long breakfast bar, it is hard to imagine the original and tiny location that is now just a storage space.  One side of the restaurant has glass doors through which one can see the outer area (which is lovely) and of course, when the weather is warmer, they can be opened up for outside seating. As for the food, just as good as the other location(s) with a focus on simply prepared but delicious food. I had the waffle with two strips of bacon for about $9 and added two scrambled eggs for another $3. I also had a cup of their wonderfully strong Joe so make sure to ask for cream if you want to take the edge off.   As it is near the college I'm sure you can get breakfast all day so if your Saturday or Sunday starts when others eat lunch, you are still good. The one thing I don't think they have is any adult beverages, which is not uncommon at many establishments in the Tempe area so something to be aware of if that is a consideration on your part.  Oh, if you don't want to ride your bike there is free parking by the restaurant so you don't necessarily have to park in the parking garage (and I don't know if that requires payment or is free, like I said, I tend to ride my bike in this area). So, go check out their newest location.  I don't think you will be dissappointed.:-)",

Saturday late morning....PLEASE be prepared to WAIT. It was a little over an hour for a group of 6. Altho the empty tables sat dirty for a while - so maybe they were short on bussers. The wait wasn't too bad because you can walk along the lake, sit in the grass and enjoy the architecture of the State Farm campus.   We were seated inside, and our waitress was super cool. I have to forewarn you; the actual menu itself is pretty limited. 10 items max for breakfast and maybe 6-7 sandwhich/lunch items. Their ice tea was delish. I ordered the special that was a \"chicken enchilada sausage\" scramble with jalapenos. Yum! But even better than that were their breakfast potatoes. YUM! My husband ordered a side of bacon, but by the time I was ready to try it - he had eaten it all! HAHA!   I love the area, and the food was yum, so I would probably come back!",

We brought friends with us to have breakfast today and there was a line by the door when Jason yelled at us in the most aggressive manner, \"Can you not block my door?!\". He was so demeaning to us the whole restaurant almost heard. With no apology, my friends and I felt we were targeted and not welcomed because we are all minorities. I cannot believe how rude he was to us and then when my fiance tried to talk to him regarding that, he denied and said he asked us nicely which was a lie. We left and more people came in and blocked the door. My friend called him out on it as to why it was okay for them to be by it and all Jason did was smile and walk away.Then he got really mad and called security on us to get us \"off his property\". The property managers in the area came and actually spoke to us and understood the gravity of the situation more than that jerk did. I really hope you get in trouble Jason. That is not the way to speak to anyone at all!",

Well my food came with chipsI let the server (not the waitress) know I didn't order chips but the potatoes she immediate brought a side of the potatoes (great service) and I ordered sourdough but got wheat bread no biggie. We continued to eat and my coffee was running low waitress no where to be found however the server was close by \"don't know where our waitress is but can I get some more coffee please\" she immediately brought more coffee, great service!  We continued to eat our meal and talk and yet again I had to ask another person for more coffee since our waitress was no where to be found.  We where done with our meal and sat there waiting for our illusive waitress, we had to ask the very attentive waiter (very nice young man who knew his regulars) again \"we don't know where are waitress is but can we get a couple togo boxes and our check\" really!!!  I am a very good tipper I always give more than 20% however this time I did not tip a cent food was great just make sure you sit at the table where the young man will wait on you.",

They use many local organic ingredients and you can taste the difference. Our litmus test at every breakfast or lunch restaurant, to see if they really care, is to check the ketchup bottle to see if it lists high fructose corn syrup as an ingredient. The logic is that natural sugar ketchup costs more, and restaurants who serve it up really care about our health and theirs, down to the smallest detail. Matt's passed the test!

    "text": "I came here with a few friends visiting from out of town. I have been to the one in Arcadia-Biltmore area and thought this one in Tempe would be a great experience like the one I've had. Well, this was not the case, to say the least. We get there, but since we're one person short (3/4), the manager asks us to wait for a table, even though there are multiple available for 4 people (I mean, there are no tables of three as far as I'm concerned. 3 people take up a table of 4). After a 20-25 minute wait (15 min after the 4th person got there, mind you), we get a table, and one of my friends ordered the Bloody Mary. He said it was awful; I couldn't believe him until I tried it myself. Awful cannot describe how bad this drink was, and I have had Bloody Mary's before. We end up ordering food and after a rather long wait (granted, they were a bit busy), we get it. Literally half of our orders are missing: no coffee, no toast, no preserves. We had to tell a waiter and our waitress on separate occasions to get it to us. This is a polar opposite of MBB in Arcadia; the manager in Tempe better get his act together and take some notes from the other one. Or just go to the one in Arcadia if you want some good MBB.",

Staff was super friendly too. I'm pretty simple when it comes to breakfast so I opted for the two egg breakfast with their incredible bacon. What's even more enjoyable is their thick sliced sourdough toast. The hash browns are also delicious. But let me get back to the bacon. Thick cut. Peppered. Perfectly cooked crisp with an outstanding smoky flavor. And while you may be tempted to get Starbucks across the way, their coffee is also flavorful. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need a nap after this in this hot weather but it's worth it. Vince was a great guy too. Breakfast is also served all day. Parking in the Marina Center. Free wifi. Just happy that there wasn't a wait!",

As soon as I entered the restaurant I was greeted immediately and told that I could sit anywhere which was great. Soon after I picked a table I was approached by a friendly waiter with a menu. Looking over the menu I initially wanted to try the pancakes but the menu offers them alone so I chose the waffle which included bacon on the side. However, I asked if I could substitute the bacon for the apple smoked sausage that was offered with their French toast special. If you want eggs you will have to order them separately which I found a little annoying.  Once the food was served the presentation was great but I must admit I expected more in the taste area. For one when I tried the waffle the taste of flour was very overwhelming to me. I have definitely had better tasting waffles. The sausage that I was charged a extra $4.00 for tasted like a smoked kielbasa type sausage instead of the breakfast style I expected. I also ordered eggs and asked that they not be cooked to hard but they were.     Maybe my expectations were to high from all of the hype I heard but I wasn't very impressed with the food especially at the prices that they charged.",

After waiting 45 minutes to be seated and then sitting on uncomfortable barstools for 30 more minutes we found out our order mysteriously didn't get placed correctly and had to be submitted again. Then when it finally arrived the \"overhard\" eggs were runny and cold, the hash browns were partially burnt, yet raw in the middle. Our server offered no apologies - only excuses. The server never asked us if we wanted beverage refills (we did), nor were we provided with an order update-  even after it was obvious someone screwed up because customers seated 30 minutes after us had ordered and left before our food appeared.  Don't go unless you want overpriced Bloody Mary's, which are admittedly the only consistently good thing on the menu.",

The menu here is somewhat limited providing maybe 8-10 options for breakfast. I seem to be a creature of habit, so again, I order the skinny breakfast consisting of 4 egg whites with apple sausage, tomatoes, cheese (I request easy) and a salad with vinegarette on the side. Very fresh and yummy.  I also got a hot coffee with almond milk as a substitute for cream. By the way, the coffee here is a locally roasted brew and it is rich and Delish!!!  As for the service?.....always very accommodating, friendly and fast. Our server was more than willing to make sure our experience was above and beyond.  The atmosphere is clean and modern. They also offer outdoor seating with a nice view with ample seating.   I recommend this place especially if you're out and about exploring the lake or taking in an event at the ASU stadium across the street.",

First off, the menu only listed 10 breakfast plates, so the \"Big\" in their name couldn't possibly mean the number of breakfast items.  In fact, the only thing on my plate that was big was the Hash Browns, the greasy Hash Browns.  The bacon I placed on the plate where the Hash Browns were, ended up floating in the Hash Brown grease.  The Hash Browns were also a strange grease/oily color, not your typical crispy  brown from the griddle.  Despite the level of the grease, the insides were soft.  The 2 eggs over easy were done properly, but the coffee wasn't all too tasty.  Possibly, if I had ordered pancakes, they may have been big, so that may affect my review, but others in my wife's group all felt their meal was sub par and greasy.   Finally, the server told me they don't serve cream for your coffee.  What?  No cream?  Nope, just milk (and I am unsure if it was even whole milk because it took a lot of milk to lighten up my otherwise so-so coffee).  Rise Up Dairy Farmers and complain about that!! While the blueberry jam they provided was tasty, it just couldn't wipe the greasy flavor out of my mouth.",

I thought there were two separate lines for take out vs getting seated to dine in, so unfortunately we got passed up a few times before we got a table. Service was ok initially but we ended up waiting a very long time (maybe 40 minutes?) for our food. We flagged down another server once we noticed several tables who arrived after us were getting their food.  Someone came back to our table and told us our order had been lost and they had to take it again! Our original server never came back to our table once our order had to be re-taken but others came by to check on us several times.   In the end, the food was very delicious and our bill was taken care of but I probably won't be bringing my future mother in law back here ever again... I understand that mistakes happen but kinda disappointed that our original server didn't seem to notice or care how long we had to wait for our food even after we made them other servers aware of it.   I'll give this place another try with my bf instead cos the food was so good",

It also comes with two delicious slices of thick cut bacon.  If you come here be prepared to wait a while for a table, but it really is worth it.",

My biggest complaint would be that this isn't a regular menu item. What the heck?  It was outstanding. I got the Pork & Chick with the sour bread toast. They have a magnificent jelly or marmalade. I must've been asked if I wanted a refill on coffee 5 times. Great service, excellent food!",

I thought it was an April fools joke but apparently not! Food elsewhere is just as good with better service and you don't have to spend $$$ on refills that cost a few pennies!",

My order only took about 10 minutes, and was given to me with a smile. Just from the customer service alone, I would return to this place. As for the food, you have to try it for yourself! Cooked just right for me and smells amazing! Great job to the morning staff of Mike's Big Breakfast!",

    "text": "First, Matt's \"Big\" Breakfast is quite an overstatement.  It's medium at best.  They also have no reasonable low carb options and everything comes with potatoes and toast.  No creamer for your coffee.  Seriously?  I don't mean they were out, I mean they don't provide it to their customers.  Ok so I'll have a soda.  Soda machine is broken.  I had the pork chop and eggs, and the steak knife they brought was by far the largest thing on the plate.  The chop had zero seasoning, was undercooked, tiny and chewy.  All this for $13.  Rip off.  The young lady who served us was very nice; she was the only positive aspect of this  experience and I will go hungry before ever going back to this place.",
