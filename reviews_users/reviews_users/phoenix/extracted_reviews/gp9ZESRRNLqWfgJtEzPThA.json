I was there on a Wed afternoon after 3 so the lunch specials, which looked awesome, were already over but...I heard the cashier, who was incredibly nice, tell the girl in line in front of me that there were $5 one topping pizzas. Ok, cool, I ordered a cheese pizza and some bread sticks and waited about 10 min. My order was ready and when I got home, I went for a slice and was baffled by what I saw. They actually drizzled ranch dressing on the crust of the pizza. Seriously? WTF? I threw the soggy, obviously overcooked hunk of shit away. The breadsticks were delicious,hot and fresh but verrrrry garlicky. There was also a sauce of some sort on the table so I took a to go thing with some in it and it was like Frank's red-hot sauce and vinegar, maybe? It tasted weird. Im just so disappointed. I wanted to really like this place. I'll probably give them another try as they sell burgers, gyros and cheese steaks too.",

I wasn't drunk but it was late and although the slice looked pathetic it tasted just fine. The price was right though so I didn't feel like I got ripped off. They have a good variety in the menu so I'll likely be back at least one more time to test some more of the options. Staff were friendly and seating area was clean, bathroom was ready for a good cleaning but not disgusting. It's a one person at a time so it could be a wait if you need to use it. This is definitely a late night place so if the food impresses I'll be adding a star soon.",

Placed a decent sized delivery order ($51) and tipped $7 from the yelp app last Saturday night, and being that I wasn't ordering directly through Geno's I called to confirm my order went through. They said it had and that I had a 1 hr and 20 minute wait even though the yelp app said it would be 30-40. I said that was fine and me and my roommates took a nap and set our alarm for an hour from then. Upon waking to the alarm I noticed I had ONE missed call from 40 minutes earlier. I checked the door to see if we had missed the delivery/and pick up our pizza. There was nothing there. I immediately called Geno's and they said they had called several times and knocked. The door bell was never rang, and I only received one call and they didn't leave the pizza at the door even tho I had already paid. They said they could not re-deliver, I could not pick it up, and I could not be refunded. If this is how Geno's conducts their business I will not be ordering from them again.",

So, I ordered food a couple more times since and tonight was my 5th time ordering. The delivery once again took well over an hour and the driver couldn't find my apartment, by now I figured somebody would have put notes in the system.   This time I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and loaded fries. Once again my food was COLD, WORSE THAN THE FIRST TIME. So cold that once I got the pizza box inside my apartment, the outside of the box was noticeably cold, I opened it and touched the pizza and it was too late. The guy was gone. Fries once again were cold and coagulated. I can't put into words how disappointed and upset I am, other than I will never be ordering food for delivery or in person from this place again. Getting cold food I'm paying $20+ for two out of five times is enough for me. Don't bother contacting me and offering me free food again. I don't want it, no butt kissing is going to fix this. I'm just putting this up here to warn others. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE THAT APPRECIATES IT",

I hope noone there got raises for the holidays.. youre just one step above gus's pizza and i will never eat at that place again.

They have a foot long slice for $2.50, and you can get a flavored crust. They are open til 5am every day, so you can count on Geno's for a midnight snack. They just remodeled the inside of the restaurant a few months ago, but I normally get takeout. Their service is fast, not taking more than 15mins to get my takeout. Geno's also provides delivery through Yelp or Uber Eats. I currently also get 10% back in Uber credits every time I eat at Geno's, due to some Visa Local Rewards program I signed up through the default Uber app.",

The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.  The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.  Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.  On a previous visit I had the gyro sandwich. I found it to be very wet and gooey, not much flavor at all to the meat.  My last visit. I will say the pizza prices are fair for what they are offering.   My problem is the lack of being sanitary.",

Loyal employees are hard to come by.

I call and am told I can return it now and wait for a replacement or I can return it after my movie and they would replace it then. I explain this is my dinner and ask if I am supposed to wait 2 1/2 hours for that and the \"manager\" tells me \"Well I can't bring it to you\" I inform her I will not be dining there again and she says \"okay great!

The open kitchen had a nice clean appearance.  Problems... Cashier could've been a little more informative about their favorites, we told her it was our first visit and we struggled to get an answer on what was great there. We finally settled on the cheesesteak by default, not recommendation.  I also bought two half sandwiches of the same thing and noticed that you get free fries with a full sandwich. Just figured she would recommend the free fries, especially since I hinted on it then just bought them.  They also have a promo for free fries for Yelp users but I didn't want to beg for free fries, so I just let it go. Just down the street is a brand new portillos which is basically the same concept on steroids. Going to a place like this I would've expected a smaller and more personalized experience which never happened. I would think they would be busier if they were a little more on point.  Oh... The ketchup seemed watery... Weird.",

For your average drunkard, that may mean the world, but I work nights and I am up every night. To me it's just dinner, and it was a wack dinner at that. Ordered two pies and they were both dry as can be with very little cheese and little to no toppings. Perhaps I should have ordered a cheese steak instead, but to be honest, this place has little to no incentive to make me want to trade old faithful places. If you are serious about your pizza and your subs.... go to Philly, or NY and just buy a frozen pizza in the meantime... Thanks for delivering late, Geno's, but your food is WACK!",

I've been ordering pizza and wings late night from Geno's for a few years now. I would say for a light night spot it is clutch for that. Tonight I ordered tacos (seven total) for the first time and when I got home I noticed they forgot to make the quesadilla taco. I was already bummed because after we ordered guacamole and paid they came out later to tell us they were out. Although the refunded us it was kinda a buzz kill that we would be eating them without the guacamole. When I called in to let them know they forgot the quesadilla taco they were very rude and said that they had put it in the bag. Therefore calling me a liar. I'm a fair person and again I have never been upset enough to take the time to write a review, but after they rudely hung up the phone on me (Margaret specifically), I felt the need to do this. I will not be going back to Geno's unless I receive an apology from this company. And when I say I order a lot of food from there I'm talking about 100 a week worth. That's a lot of business to lose out on.",

    "text": "Have been going here for a while now, maybe 5-10 times and their food is pretty decent , but pretty average. Good food when your hungry or a little drunk but there's one thing at this location that really has me done with it for good. The employees here are terrible. Every time I have been here they are extra low life, extra slow and extra careless. Called in for pickup on a basic pepperoni pizza and they told me it's a 15-20 min wait. Waited 30 mins to get there just to give them a little extra time, got there and paid and my pizza was done after waiting there for 45 mins no joke. On top of that I noticed earlier the same size pizza box as the one I ordered was sitting on the take out shelf but I thought it was someone's order from before mine. Turns out it was my pizza box sitting there for 20 minutes before they brought it to me.  Another time I went up to order and it was pretty late with literally no one but me in the store and the guy on register saw me but continued to slowly walk around the store doing pretty much nothing. Finally he slowly walked up to the register to take my order after about 2-3 mins of me waiting there. He took my order in the most lowlife fashion I have ever seen anyone take an order.  After this he walked back to the kitchen and proceeded to make a Phillies cheese stake for himself before getting started on my order. Don't wanna sounds like Donald trump too much but DISGUSTING customer service! Also don't wanna disrespect this guy working there tonight and disregard everything I say if he's mentally handicapped or something but he literally couldn't piece his words together to take my order and didn't even know what their special Geno's cheese sauce was or that they had it (melted cheese wiz on sandwich). I honestly don't know who hires these people or what that person is thinking but I'm just surprised this location hasn't gone out of business. Altogether it's a bad atmosphere and I really can't pick up one any of these peoples vibes even if I try. Sorry to say but this location doesn't even deserve a whole star. If you are considering going here, save the effort and time and head to Gus's or DP dough instead. This location does NOT deserve your money!",

The wait; however, is what keeps this from a 5-star review. Perhaps it cannot be helped with the traffic that comes through. Perhaps in the future they will develop more efficient methods of food creation. Time will tell...",

Driver for the delivery was very polite and called prior to arriving to confirm the address since I ordered through the app and she knew the area tends to provide the wrong address. Pizza was spot on! Thin crust and great toppings all over the pizza. The boneless buffalo wings were the standard fair with ample sauce. The cheesesteak was delicious! Enough cheese, perfect onion and pepper ratio and the mushrooms added made the sandwich perfect. If I'm in the area again I'll definitely order.",

    "text": "This review is strictly about the take out service, which if done correctly would have Garnered Geno's a perfect 5 star as the quality of the food is top notch, and it's the only place to get an authentic Philly cheesesteak around. That said, I have now had 3 separate orders that have come missing items, wrong, or a combination of both. From a pizza ordered that was missing toppings chosen, to a salad having toppings that were not supposed to be on the salad, it appears that the care to ensure delivery/takeout orders is at the bottom of the checklist. I'll continue to frequent Geno's, but only if I can make it in to order in person and check the order prior to leaving. It's a shame because there's nothing better than watching some football with some excellent delivery, but the attention to detail just isn't there with Geno's, which turns excitement for food into disappointment and anger.  Edit: I should have read reviews earlier as I have found that all the negative ones are about delivery being wrong, cold, late..",

I ordered exactly that, and saw the screen say the additional slice was $3.00. I let the employee know it says the wrong price and he said, \"Oh. Ya it's $3.00 now.\" I held up the menu that SAYS $2.00. And he said, \"Oh. Someone must have wiped the new price off by accident.\" I said, your menu on the back wall behind the counter ALSO says $2.00. He said, \"Ya it must have gotten wiped off too.\"  I asked for a manager, to which he said he was. I then let him know what they are doing is illegal and is False advertising. He did NOT care. It took me 3 more threats that charging me a price higher than what they have listed is illegal and he finally said he would take A WHOLE DOLLAR OFF. No apologies, no ownership, nothing.  I also visited this place over THREE MONTHS AGO and this same thing happened. So this store has been ILLEGALLY CHARGING PEOPLE for more than 3 months, and they DO NOT CARE.  ABSOLUTELY do not go here.   Imagine someone trying to say you owe them more money than you actually do and then not owning up to THEIR mistake at ALL.",

Perhaps if I'd eaten it sooner (or eaten in) I could have enjoyed the fries. They were packaged in an aluminum/plastic container so the stream condensed inside. They sound switch to sobering more breathable to prevent this. Don't let this put you off, because the sandwich was divine.",

Name yourself Geno's; be even a little bit like GENO'S STEAKS then.  They are dependant on kids living off momma and daddy.  They care nothing about reasonable product for the price. My Philly was just slightly thicker than a pencil. Read the other reviews to see why they got one star.  Have fun ripping dumb college kids off. I'm to old for that. I can't put any mustard on this.

Tonight must have been a special occasion because we had a pretty funny dude working the register. He might have been new to the job or maybe working a different part of the job than he's used to but he had a great attitude and kept us smiling.   The pizza slices were amazing. I didn't think the foot-long slice would actually be that long but it definitely was -- if not longer. I custom made my slice with jalapenos, salami, and feta cheese with a cajun crust. It was pretty dang delicious. Received it hot, cooked perfect, and a little greasy just like pizza should be. Wasn't dry. Wasn't dripping. It was the perfect amount. My wife ordered a veggie slice and the cashier reminded her of what veggies were included and that they were an additional cost/topping. Good service right there.   The atmosphere was what I hoped it would be. A tv on so you could see what was going on in the Wild World of Sports, it wasn't loud at all so it was perfect for conversation, and everything was clean. We were there around 8:30 and the place was spotless and had people coming in and out the whole time.   Overall, thank you for the excellent service and the great pizza. We'll be coming back to try other slices, maybe a burger, and DEFINITELY some of the specialty fries.",

My boyfriend and I come here for our regular philly at least a couple of times a month and we are always so well taken care of by Maddie. She is so sweet and always so patient with our complicated order. For example - Today, we ordered one Philly and without even asking, Maddie had our sandwich and fries split for us. She is a great asset to Geno's and our experience there!!",

    "text": "I recently stayed at the Holiday Inn Express near Sky Harbor and quickly realized my delivery food options were slim to none around lunchtime. After some Yelp filtering I found this place and figured why not give it a shot.   I ordered through the online system within Yelp which was very easy to use and navigate. My quoted wait time was 45-60 mins and my order did arrive to my hotel room door by that time.  Food wise my sandwich was pretty good. I had the Italian sub, toasted with mild peppers added. The bread was a bit soggy when it arrived, but that was probably due to the car ride. The taste of the meats was really my favorite. Very flavorful and delicious.  Overall this was a good delivery lunch option and I'd recommend it to any other hotel stayers in the area!",

    "text": "My kids and I live across the street from Geno's and were excited to go after they opened.  Our first visit was ok. Staff was nice.  Food mediocre.  Restaurant clean.  We went back for our second visit about 6 weeks later.  We ordered a Greek salad,  Greek fries,  3 slices,  a burger, a cheesesteak, and mozzarella sticks.  The salad was served almost immediately.  Then the wait began.  For 30 minutes we sat and watched as the staff cut lettuce, drank soda and joked around. We finally get the pizza.  3 slices that had very obviously been sitting for hours. To spruce them up the \"cook\" sprinkled a few strands of fresher cheese over top and reheated. The slices were so thin and wet..wet! You couldn't even pick it up. The cheese sticks were next. They were piping hot.. with frozen marinara. Actually frozen. I asked if there was any warm sauce and was told no. In a pizza place. The cheesesteak and Greek fries were next. Greasy yet dry, at the same time. Stale roll. My daughter had to drench it in ketchup to get down a few bites . the fries were \"baked\".. they were dry, rock hard and stuck to their baking pan. Almost no toppings that make them \"Greek\".  After, another 15 minutes the burger came out but sat behind the counter until my 16 year old got up and asked for her sister's food. My son and I couldn't eat the pizza. I went up to the counter.  I told the cashier that the pizza was very disgusting, obviously old and that I wanted a refund.  She acted like I raped her favorite stuffed animal. She disappeared, and came back almost 10 minutes later offering, not a refund but a free pizza. We took the pizza and my kids said school pizza is better. School pizza!!!!! If the HORRIBLE crap they call food isn't enough of a reason to deter you from eating at Geno's,  perhaps the hour+ wait, and careless staff will.",

When I go out and let them know at the counter that the lights are out in the bathroom while I was using it he says sorry we're closing and gives me the opportunity to finish using the bathroom nor does he truly apologize for having not checked the bathroom and making it dark in the first place. Just another unfavorable experience at this dump in the wall I highly doubt I'll ever give them another try. So far the two times I have been there the food was garbage and then it goes dark in the bathroom and they don't even let you finish using it.",

I ordered it at 6:46 pm (that's what my emailed receipt says) and after an hour and a half passed, I called to see what was going on because I hadn't received my order.  The girl who answered the phone was extremely rude and told me to be patient because delivery orders take about an hour, but it had been almost two.. so after I was told my delivery guy was on his way, I get a call 20 minutes later saying they were out of lemonade.  I then proceeded to tell them i would take a sweet tea and a sprite.  I was told they didn't have sprite so I asked for a water instead.  The deliver guy called me again 30 minutes later asking where to go even though I provided an exact address not even 10 minutes away from Genos.  After he finally arrived I was anxious to open my pizza.  The mozzarella sticks were cold and hard, and the pizza was old and didn't have garlic crust. The sweet tea wasn't sweet tea, but instead it was warm green tea.  I am so displeased with my experience, the people I had to interact with, and the food.  Never will I order from here again and I wouldn't recommend it at all.",

I have to heat the deli meat anyway to kill any bacteria, pg problems. ANYWAY, they got my order correct, AND included LOTS of pickles per my request. They didn't skimp on the meat and the subs are huge. I think I have 6 meals taken care of now. A half is perfect for me.  Management- thank you so much for those pickles. I needed them!",

The only thing that I know is that a \"Wit Whiz\" is the ONLY WAY to make a cheesesteak, not some peppers and provolone way.  With that out of the way, let me tell you about Geno's. It's not a bad 'steak. It just costs too much. Does it beat Forefather's? No. No one does. Does it beat Philly's Famous, Philly's, or Zesty Zzeeks? Well, probably not, but it's not bad, is what I'm saying. Just too expensive.  The fries are good & hot, as was the 'steak, Wit Whiz. I may be back for a second try, but unless the price on a sandwich comes down, I know how it tastes.",

After ordering, when I presented the waitress with my Local Flavor certificate for $20.00, the waitress informed me that she could not accept the certificate for the face value but would give us $10.00 credit toward our bill.  When we questioned further, she stated that they were having issues with Local Flavor issuing more certificates than they should have and hence, she would not honor them.  No amount of testing logic would change her mind and we either left the establishment or took the $10.00 credit for a $20.00 certificate.  We will definitely not be returning to this restaurant.  Even asked if maybe she would give us a couple soda's for our trouble but not even that compromise was acceptable to her.",

Got the cheese steak sandwich with grilled onions, grilled peppers, and a cheese sauce. Was $10.99 and pretty standard-sized. Steak was tender but overall sandwich was pretty average versus competition in this area. Much better was the Italian grinder sandwich that we got. Plenty of Pepperoni and salami with lettuce tomatoes onions and peppercini, with a creamy Italian dressing and superb fresh-baked in the store bread that really made the sandwich! Garlic fries we're just average. They also have a larger unit near 22nd Ave and Camelback near Grand Canyon University with a bar.",

We've had delivery with the same directions and no problems thusfar. The best thing was the mushrooms but they were on the warm side even. Horribly disappointing.",

    "text": "After having a semi bad experience with the cheese steaks, the owner offered to give me 20 credit, but I didn't take it.  I wanted to try other things in the menu and since I was in town, I decided to grab another bite.  Before I go on, what I forgot to mention in my last review is about the service.  The staff was friendly and attentive to my order and they treated me the same during my 2nd visit.  The store remained clean and the environment was still a place I didn't mind being in.  As far as the food goes.  This time I tried something different.  I saw that they had Gyros so I took a chance on that.  Philly fries sounded good as well so I put that up on the order too.    They were slammed with phone orders and I was behind 2 other customers.  The wait wasn't too long considering that they had to handle a lot (so no complaints there)  Once I got my food, both looked and smelled delicious.  Gyro served on a platter with all the fix-ins that made it right.  The Pita bread wasn't crisp or dry, and it was served nice and warm.  The Philly fries were a little bit salty.  But this time, I didn't need to drown the meat in ketchup to enjoy it.  It was decent enough to claim the word \"satisfying\".  It's a great and different side order.  It's pretty much a cheese steak on top of french fries, but that combination works really good.  Overall, the food was a bit better the 2nd time around.  I'll probably come by for another visit if I'm on this side of town.",

There is a time and place to figure out scheduling. The sad thing is I'll continue to eat here and continue to resent the Geno's employees.   I won't even go into hygiene.",

My friend and I were looking forward to Geno's so much so that we drove out of our way to have it. I redeemed the yelp offer for free fries or drink. We walked in and the girl at the counter was talking with her friends and wouldn't acknowledge us. We didn't get a \"what can I get for you\" or anything. She simply looked up from her register, we took this as a cue to order. We ordered a pepperoni pizza with sausage, Greek fries and garlic fries. We requested ranch seasoning on the crust, we had it before at a different location and it was great. I asked to redeem my check in offer to which I was told they \"no longer accept coupons.\" She told me I could order online and use it, which makes no sense since it was a check-in offer. We got our fries, her garlic fries had such a small portion and the cheese on my Greek fries was burnt. We were starving so we ate them anyways. Our pizza came out and this was where the major issue started. To our surprise there was ranch dressing squirted on the crust and the sausage looked like it had gone bad. My friend went to the counter and asked the girl about it thinking maybe there was a misunderstanding about ranch sauce vs. ranch seasoning and also the sausage. By this time we both just wanted to leave due to the poor customer service. She requested a refund, to which the girl said she could but she had to call her manager. When she came back she said her manager had told her we could have a new pizza but no refund. She went on to tell us that there is no corporate number when we asked and it's not her fault that they don't do things like other Geno's.  We didn't even want a full refund, just for the pizza itself. Disappointing since I just moved and this is the closest location and they have late hours.",

No veggies, no flavor, just a pathetic sorry hogue with meat in it. I couldn't be more disappointed. Waste of $10, spend your money somewhere else. Absolutely ordinary, and nothing special at all. I could have found other places to spend my money.",

This was an appreciation that I now have ten times over Bc let's face it,  there's no food like east coast food and cheesesteaks are a staple.  Genos is a real philly cheesteak. Im talking perfectly  thin sliced steak grilled onions and WIZ. The WIZ certified the cheesesteak. Delicious!  I can bring my family here when they come to visit and not end up swimming with the fishes!  Totally love Genos! Great food, awesome service & a flash back of home...5 stars",

And they don't listen to directions well when you ask to hold or add an ingredient. Unfortunately, the only thing good is their loaded fries. Delivery is not the best option. Delivery entails a soggy, cold mess. Not worth it unless you are starving and need a side of extra salty.",

    "text": "An actual Suburban-style Philadelphia Cheesesteak Hoagie in Tempe, AZ!  Don't let the name fool you.  If you are expecting a cheesesteak like you'd get at Geno's on Passayunk Ave, well, you won't.  This isn't that style of cheesesteak.  But, it is  a very good cheesesteak like you'd find in all of the suburbs surrounding the city.  When you're from Philadelphia and away from home, sometimes you just need a \"Cheesesteak\" and not a \"Philly Steak and Cheese\"...whatever that is.  In all my travels I have only encountered a good cheesesteak in 1 place outside of Philadelphia.  That was in Houston and it was perfect, complete with the jumbo can of Cheez Whiz on the grill.  Now, I have found 2.  This time in Tempe.  Most of the time you can tell from reading the menu that you just shouldn't even bother to try.  You can always find pizza or Chinese food.  But, this menu was close enough to what I'd find at home to risk it.  I'm glad I did.  Cheesesteak Hoagie just like home, delivered to my hotel.  Thank you, Geno's.",

With that being said the food that I have tried here has just been okay so far. I did try a slice on the NY style cheese pizza and it was okay but nothing special. I thought the garlic and parmesan breadsticks were underwhelming as you can hardly taste the flavors at all, not to mention it was very greasy.  I did see quite a few people order take-out for a large size pizza so I may have to try that sometime (since they're open late). So far I haven't been too impressed with coming here though but I'm willing to try them again.",

Ordered for delivery (they charge $5-wtf.) & we got the food - not only was the \"half cheese steak\" literally 3'5 inches for $5-$7, it was drenched in grease the bread was soggy, the cheese was not even there, the steak was alright, and the onions were hardly there.... My husband said the Swiss burger wasn't bad, the wings were the size of literal mouse drippings - hardly a bite each, and the cheese fries were covered in the greasy watery cheese... Sad! Sad! Sad!",
