Then we had the mixed seafood linguine (forgot the name) and it was good, a little overpriced and could have used a little more shrimp. Our daughter had the single serving of manicotti - she loved it and it was appropriately priced. Our little one had the kids spaghetti and meatball, very good and a nice sized portion. Very nice design of the restaurant. Benny was our server, outside on the patio. He was great and definitely a great ambassador for the restaurant. The ladies room needs attention, Iock didn't work on the door for the handicap stall, never good.  Also, paper towel machines need replacing. There was a fan on the patio that needed replaced as well. Would have given 4 stars if it wasn't overpriced.",

    "text": "Oh man. Came here on a Saturday night with 7 coworkers on a work trip. We waited in the lobby, for lack of a better term, for literally 10 minutes before a hostess came. There was another party sitting down that looked like they were waiting for the rest of their group to join them - they weren't. They'd literally taken a seat because they'd been there waiting to be seated even longer than us! That's completely unacceptable. From that moment on, I knew this was going to be a shit-show of a dinning experience so I started a timer to record just how awful it really was. It took over 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us and take our drink orders. Amazing! We put in our food orders and almost 46 minutes later got our dinner. The food was decent. Nothing to write home about or return for. All in all, our experience was over an hour and a half. Our drinks were never refilled and the entire customer service experience in that restaurant is deplorable at best. They also walk you through the kitchen on the way to your table. There was shit everywhere and it was filthy to say the  least. See my attached picture of the floor.",

I love Bucca's in Minneapolis, and have usually had to wait quite a while for table there, but in Scottsdale I was seated immediately and waited on by a waitress who said she was brand new.  She did a phenomenal job as she was kind, welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Spaghetti with meatballs and order of garlic bread was my choice.  Had enough leftovers for two large meals at home the next 2 days.  While I like the concept of family style eating it has problems for the lone diner, and I wish I would have had the option for normal portion size that came with a salad or veggies instead.",

The service was very friendly, and a server came to take my order very quickly. She was knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in the ordering process. What threw me off was when she indicated that my order should only take about 5 minutes (for baked ziti). About 20 minutes later when I was able to get her attention (she was working alone and several tables had filled up) she indicated that she would bring my food right out. What I anticipated as a small plate of baked ziti was enough to feed a family. I ate what I could, but took home two take-out containers full of pasta. Summary, portion sizes are huge, service is friendly, but slow when they get busy. Food was just ok.",

Service was friendly but they did run out of the house wine we were drinking and were limited on other choices that they had in stock. I have no idea who would want to sit in the kitchen but the option is there if you should choose to try it.  To summarize:  *Vegetarian options: the eggplant parmesan was very good. The eggplant was not soggy, fried correctly and sauce accompanying it tasted homemade. *Spaghetti and Meatballs-Al dente but I was told the meatballs lacked substantial flavor. *Chicken Carbonara-very good, creamy and you won't be able to stop eating it! *Traditional wicker basket chianti was very good, smooth and fruity!",

A big, loud, Italian mixed family.   They started off with a huge bottle of wine, and then the food started pouring onto the table (benefits of advance notice of what we would be ordering). I still felt bad for our server though because we can be quite demanding, though he seemed to take it in stride.  The meal was delicious, we had a fine mixture of traditional holiday foods as well as a few of our Italian classics. My only real complaint was that I ate too much and felt very uncomfortable.  Why then you ask am I giving it only four stars? The food WAS delicious, and the service was impeccable, but you could still tell it was a national chain restaurant, and you could still tell that the servers didn't want to be there working on the holiday.  Would I come back? Maybe, but I will head to one closer to home.",

The steamed mussels used to be good too,with the white and red sauce mixed the last time we went the size was smaller and they barely put enough sauce, The calamari was very fishy smelling. I think it went thru some transition so we are going to try it one more time. I am going to ask for extra sauce and extra cheese.

I really appreciated his call and we have had wonderful past visits there. I am satisfied with his rectifying the situation and his apology. Our family will be back, we love the chicken carbonara!  Went there with family (party of 8) excited for advertised \"Thanksgiving Feast\". We were there at 2:00 pm. Had pasta to start, told the waiter we planned to have the turkey feast. At 2:30pm the manager came to tell us they were out of turkey- at 2:30pm!!!! We did not get any type of good alternative, no offer to take anything off the Bill- even our server suddenly gave up and we did not see much of him (Had to ask for drink refills and grab our own napkins and silverware off other tables).  Finally ordered pizza since it was too late to go anywhere else. I am calling the district manager on Monday! They ruined our Thanksgiving. Now I have to cook a turkey dinner for my family. So, the advertised \"Stress Free Thanksgiving Feast\" was a bust. I was most surprised that the manager did not make any effort  to make it right. We had just spent $700 with them Oct 5th for my daughter's post wedding party. Shame on you manager, you just lost my confidence in your establishment.",

Anyway, everything started off great when we entered the restaurant and said we had a reservation and they immediate knew it was us. And acknowledged my daughters birthday which made her happy and made me breathe a sigh of relief.   The server was great. And as usual, the food like at all Buca's was excellent!   A very good time.

On my last night in Scottzy, I decided to hit this place up with my crew. First - servings are enough to feed a small village in the Amazon basin. Second - more seasoning and deliciousness than in the entire British cuisine from the past 500 years.  They did have a bit of a mix up on our order, but I gotta give 5 stars because not only did my main man Manny be super courteous, but the manager came over personally and let us get that part of our meal on the house. Aka - they dope.  So ladies and gentleman, get your rear down there and enjoy the fine Italian cuisine in a dope setting with kind peeps.",

She explained everything to them and it was really impressive to see someone take such pleasure in explaining the menu.

When we arrived there were a few large groups (teams in for a tournament) but not full by any means. Our waiter came right away, introduced himself and presented as if he was on the ball and ready to serve. That was about the extent of good service for the evening. He would come and then leave for long periods of time, never checked how things were either. As the evening went on his periods of being gone became longer and longer and we had to go to get another server to come and help us. The food was good as always, the menu has changed a little since we were there last and the prices are still great for the amount of food you get. It really is too bad that the server was so slow that he spoiled the evening for us. Not sure if we will go back anytime soon to this location as there are a lot of other very good restaurants in Old Scottsdale that have equally as good of food and have exceptional service too.",

    "text": "I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner, however that did not happen.   First, half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came, then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table.   Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks, this did not happen.   Later, we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since I'm a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat, however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti, Chicken Cannelloni, Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells), she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadn't really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner, someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates \"without meat\" so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldn't believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew, that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me, did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything.   I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night, not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldn't even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.",

Come with a family or group of people you enjoy spending time with and this restaurant will provide a very fun and memorable atmosphere. If you are lucky enough to reserve the kitchen table you will sit in the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare all the food as well as sample different dishes throughout your dining experience. For a large party, the Pope table will suit you well. It is a very large round table with a rotating Pope head in the middle, very interesting.  The only problem is if you are coming here with just one other person because the portions can be quite overwhelming and get expensive.",

Tonight we went to Buca with a party of 8 to celebrate my son earning his black belt in karate.  It was such a DISAPPOINTMENT.  Despite the fact that I made a reservation days in advance, my family was seated in the bar area.  It was uncomfortably hot throughout the entire meal, and despite numerous requests to cool the area, nothing happened.  Our server was the bartender, who clearly cared much more about making drinks for the patrons than serving any tables.   I don't blame a bartender for placing a priority on making drinks, but I blame management for having a bartender responsible for serving dinner to a table of 8.  While I tip 15% in the worst case scenario, and above that for anyone better than average, I was prepared to tip 10% at best given these circumstances.  Of course, Bucca took that option out of my hands when it included an 18% gratuity in the bill - a tip I wish was shared with the people who actually waited on our table, though I suspect it was given to the bartender only.  I am generally a very  easygoing person, but the service was SO BAD that I had to write this review.  I tried to share my disappointment with someone at the restaurant that appeared to be a manager early in the evening, but she clearly had no interest in doing anything to turn the experience around.  While I generally think Bucca's food is good and it can be a great place for large celebrations, I would not return to the Scottsdale location again give the HORRIBLE SERVICE.",

Thought it was slightly odd that you walk through the kitchen to get to your seat, but acutally a great idea. I just was not expecting to see the kitchen. The House Chianti could have been better as well. All in all a great place for some comfort food. The fettucine alfredo is amazing.",

    "text": "Visited this place last night. Very disappointed with the food quality. This place brags on quantity (family style) and I guess that's all. We had chopped salad - was too much dressing but ok. Shrimp Scampi was bland and watery. The \"garlic\" bread that came with it was cold and greasy and no signs of garlic. The bread seemed to have been some left-overs from the weekend. Spaghetti and Meatballs were tasteless and the sauce was watery and bland, I had to order the meat sauce on the side to add more taste. The noodles were soggy fat and over cooked. Overall, it was the worst Italian ever with a hefty price tag. We should have gone across the street. Again, what did I really expect from a chain. It's really hard finding good Italian in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "For those of you that don't realize... Buca's is a franchise resturant. I found my first Buca's back home in PA and was pleasently surprised at the food. I am a bit fussy about eating Italian out especially when it comes to red sauce. I like my gravy SMOOTH! Not chunky. My german girlfriend on the other hand loves chunky gravy. The amount of food you get is amazing and a small entree can surely be shared by 2 people so don't let the prices scare you. We ordered chicken carbanara white is in an alfredo style sauce with peas, panchetta bacon, chicken and proschuitto. She got a side of marinara which was some what chunky but not quite as spicey as she likes. But overall the meal was delicious to me even though the bacon was not panchetta. We also had Italian wedding soup which was NOT traditional but was equally delicious! They added roasted red peppers to it to spice it up and it was really good plus the bowl was HUGE! We finished off with an order of tiramisu which was very good also and was enough to feed 5 or 6, it was literally the size of a 8 or 9 inch pie!!! This is pretty good Italian food served just like your grandmother would have done... Enouth to feed a batallion of Marines! Two iced teas, two bowls of soup, one small entree and one dessert... $45.00. Our waitress Suzanna was very nice and did a wonderful job! You won't go wrong here unless your too picky when it comes to your gravy! LOL!",

From the hostess to the MOD, just bad.  Ordered an appetizer, it was luke warm at best...the main dish was good and so was the side. The server in the bar had all the tables and it was just him. Not filling up water, taking them and maybe returning them with the correct glass (straw...ewe!) to the correct table.

    "text": "Wow, one small dish at Buca di Beppo is the same as two large dishes at any other place!  So don't expect to ever go hungry after a visit there!  This past week, I went with a group of six people to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at Buca di Beppo in Scottsdale.  We made a reservation online (which can be made through their website or through OpenTable) and were seating pretty quickly upon arriving.  We made a request for a \"good table\" and apparently were brought as far into the restaurant (through the kitchen and around several corners) to a round-table in an alcove with quite a fun personality.    As we showed up to dinner in the later hours of the evening on a weekday, there were few other diners at the time, so we practically had our own server to ourselves.  We ordered a large dish of chicken limone, salmon sorrento, and a create-your-own-pasta with pesto.  Those three dishes were SO MUCH that it made an entirely additional meal of leftovers for four of us the next day.  The service was great for the most part though it appeared that one dish was left behind (as it arrived much later than the other dishes).  Oh, one of us did order a glass of wine, and we added a salad as an appetizer.    After the meal, the entire staff arrived with a candelabra to blow out for the birthday girl.  We all joined in with the birthday song (which was written on the menus).  We chose a delicious jumbo piece of chocolate cake instead of an entire small white cake.  You can get one too by joining the eClub.  When joining, you get a pasta discount (which sometimes changes) along with a birthday special $15 off a $30 purchase PLUS the full cake when you make a reservation to celebration with a group of four.    Certainly an experience worth having at some point though be aware that the small dishes are good for 2-3 people, and the large dishes serve approximately 5 people.  All quite pricey but delicious!",

Came back again to give us the garlic bread, still didn't bring them, so my mom asked. We ordered spaghetti and pizza. The spaghetti came out, 20-30 minutes later. But no pizza. It's only going to take a few more minutes, he said. Fifteen minutes go by and he comes back and says, the guy in the kitchen is cutting it up, I'm going to bring it right out. Another fifteen minutes later, Aaron comes out with a burnt pizza and apologizes, because he thought it was done but it wasn't.  Um, it's more than done. It's burnt. Why he still took out a pizza that was obviously black is beyond me. But aside from that, he generally did not seem that friendly or that he even cared that much. Terrible experience overall.",

I thought it was a joke, but found out you did actually have to go through the kitchen to get to the tables and main part of the restaurant. I'm not sure how I feel about that part. But anyway, so we were seated. Our server's name was Mark, and he was very pleasant and helpful, especially after finding out it was our first time there.We ordered the fried mozzarella to share and my friends got the Shrimp Florentine and my bf and I got the Chicken and Sausage Ziti. The fried mozzarella was sooo scrumptious and we enjoyed every morsel. The Chicken and Sausage Ziti was average, at least for me. My bf, however, enjoyed it. I thought the chicken and sausage seemed scarce. The alfredo sauce tasted underwhelming too. I had a bite of my friend's Shrimp Florentine and goodness, it was delicious! I loved the garlicky buttery sauce--it tasted very well-balanced with a hint of white wine, perhaps? The bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and butter was yummy to tuck into as well. My bf had a cocktail and he said it was very strong, so that was a good thing too. The serving sizes here are pretty huge, and definitely are for sharing. Prices here aren't that cheap but the serving size here makes up for it, in my opinion. My bf was really charmed with the deco of the place too. I liked it; it had a wacky, unique and funky sort of vibe with all the mismatched decorations and little trinkets. Even the photos and sculptures were all so weird, but it was kinda cool! The bathrooms also had really interesting decor as well and curious little items to look at.. We were too stuffed for dessert. All-in-all, I enjoyed our visit. My bf especially was charmed by the place and he insists on our coming back. I would like to return to try their pastas of the month since October is Pasta Month. The pasta dishes offered look absolutely scrumptious. Can't wait to return to try more dishes!",

I had no idea what size to order for the dishes that I wanted.  The person who answered my call told me what to order, I did, and it was perfect.  Just a small dish of leftovers.  We ordered baked ziti, spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic bread.  It tasted great and nobody complained about dinner.  Every single person ate a healthy plate. When I came to pick it up at the time I requested, it was ready and the take out process was smooth. I would highly recommend for a large group - and every time I have eaten in, I have been very happy with the food and service.",

It was a challenge given the PGA tournament being in town and we wound up at Buca.  I was kinda down given I know it's a chain and that there are lots of other good dining options in Scottsdale but, it was what it was and in general, I left with a decent impression. The best parts were the combination of good service and just general atmosphere that was perfect for a large group.  Family style dishes to be shared and sitting around a set of tables arranged into a large square made for good conversation and an overall fun evening.    In terms of the food, it's 3 stars, e.g. A-OK.  Nothing special to write home about but tasty overall and definitely filling.  The server recommended how many apps, salads, entrees should be ordered for a group that size and we took the recommendation and added on with a couple pizzas.  Everything came out hot and quick and the service was on top of things from the start.  I likely would not go to a Buca di Beppo for a dinner with the wife and kids but could actually see it as an option for a family reunion type deal.",

Right as I stepped into the restaurant, the host picked up his cell phone and walked away. I had to peer into the main eating area for a couple seconds for him to come back out and seat me because I was tired of waiting with no one to talk to. He said that he thought I was there for pick-up. Shouldn't he have clarified my purpose of visiting while I walked in? Hmm.   Anywhoo, I had a coupon for an individual lunch item so my choices were kind of confined (not a bad thing...I'm horrible when it comes to deciding) so I ordered Shrimp Fra Diavlo. I was pleasantly surprised when my pasta arrived within 10 minutes of placing my order, piping hot. This sort of made up for me waiting at the front when I arrived. It was so creamy and savory. The shrimp was soft and buttery, just melting in my mouth. Albeit an individual item, the serving size was generous as I was only able to eat a third before asking for a to-go box.  My server was really awkward, which made for a really awkward lunch, especially because I was dining in alone. He kept hinting at dessert and whatnot when I was barely deciding on my entree. Chillll dude, I'll tell you if I want dessert after. I sampled Bellissima, a Prosecco, because it was advertised at the front. I recommend it to anyone who wants a light wine to complement their meal.",

The food was great and the restaurant was nice, so we had pretty high expectations today when we went to the one in Scottsdale. First off, there's a funky smell, I think from the evidently old and dirty carpet. Then, there was an open kitchen and you could hear the people in it yelling at each other. You couldn't tell if they were fighting or messing around,  it they were very loud. Now, the food: my husband ordered a chicken parmigiana with a side of fettuccine Alfredo. The Alfredo sauce was not a sauce. It looked all lumpy and it did not taste good. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and the meatball I tried in Seattle tasted amazing. The sauce and the pasta were an added good. But in here, the meatball did not have a good taste. We did not enjoy our experience and will definitely not go there anymore.",

    "text": "It was the MIL's birthday and darn it, she wants her freebie!  She must have spent hours researching restaurants that give treats for your birthday before settling on this one.  Yep, this is one of those times when you take it for the team.  I dropped my wife and her mother at the door, then went to find a parking spot.  When I got back and the four of us formed up in the small waiting room dominated by the elevated podium, the manager greeted us from on high and confirmed that we were complete.  After getting approval, he led us into the kitchen.  Walking your guests through the kitchen is a cute gimmick, but could backfire quickly - like when your guests see garbage on the floors, dirty cutting boards, cluttered with food scraps and cooks standing around looking bored.  This is a vast restaurant with several separate dining areas, all decorated very period schmaltzy Italian with lots of statues, dark fabrics and walls filled with images of I assume, Italian people.  We were led to a booth in a room with a center table filled with 15 teen-aged girls.  Just us and them.  Never mind that the restaurant was practically empty, with plenty of other quieter places, this is where they chose to seat us.  I guess this must have been the 'birthday party room\".  Our server was very astute.  She realized before we sat down that we wanted privacy.  Lot's of it, and we didn't want to be bothered with things like ordering our dinner, filling our drinks, delivering our order or checking in on us.  She let us ponder our predicament, unable to converse over the crowd of teens.  Besides, she had her hands full with the table of girls.  Eventually, we got our order in.  We chose to start with a delicious basket of garlic bread, followed with a wilted brown lettuce Caesar salad dusted with Parmesan powder.  It tasted like clorox-soaked spinach.  Moving on to the entree, our choice was a large Chicken Parmesan with a side of pasta and marinara.  I guess in this Italian-style place, your entree that is traditionally served with spaghetti is not.  You have to order it separately.  After allowing our entrees to cool in the kitchen for a bit, she eventually brought them around, dropping them on the table and quickly disappearing, with nary a word.  She had a very hands-off approach to service, which left us plenty of time to wonder what she was up to.  After mucking through dinner, it came time for the big birthday celebration.  A recently-thawed cake.  A candelabra.  A stupid made-up birthday song that the servers were forced to sing.  Who cares.  MIL was happy, she got her free dessert.  On a last note, when you do the birthday thing, there are several expectations.  First you must have a coupon.  Second, you must indicate online when you make a reservation for it.  Then, you must prove it.  This requires your printed coupon, your email reply to your online reservation indicating a birthday and several forms of ID to prove that you actually have a birth date.  Would I go back?  Not a chance, not even for free cake.",

Water was not refilled and never did the server ask me if I would like an additional drink order. I surveyed the several people who attended with me and all said the service was terrible.  I took a trip to the restroom and saw several servers congregated and they looked like they had nothing to do.  Not sure if our server was overwhelmed or just slow but it would be nice for Buca to encourage the other wait staff to help someone who is slow and overwhelmed with customers.  In spite of poor service, we tipped the wait staff extremely well. The servers were polite and friendly, but slow and disorganized.",

We ordered the small salad (and there was some left over after all 4 of us ate some) Then, we shared a large shrimp Florentine that was delicious. Not much left here bc we all went back for seconds! Crusty bread with balsamic/oil for dipping was served. Had a glass of wine with dinner that paired nicely.  The waitress was a sweetheart and took good care of us. We will definitely return if we are ever back in Arizona!",

Not to mention she was very rude and short with us.  We asked about food multiple times because it was taking so long and she brushed us off and told us she will have her manager come over. (This happened twice). When food finally arrived they brought us the wrong dish and we ended up having to wait even longer. I would be more understanding if these were complicated dishes but the fact that it was pasta made this even more ridiculous. Overall it was a poor experience with bad service and average food. Hopefully they read these reviews and work on changing the way they run this Scottsdale restaurant.",

We ordered Sangria in a liter. It was weak tasting but ok. No big deal. Now the entries. 3 of them HUGE disappointment. First of all the pasta was lukewarm  The entries with chicken in the pasta were just sliced chicken addd in. No flavor. They had no seasoning   Didn't absorb the sauce  Lasagna was the best but served only lukewarm. We had been looking forward to this visit as it was a place our late Mother liked a lot   It was so poorly executed and tasteless it was a waste of 150.00  needless to say we can't recommend Buca any longer. Only reason for giving 1 , the server was polite though inefficient as far as refills etc",

First, we ordered a calamari appetizer and a bottle of wine. The problem started when our food was delivered before the wine. I mean, we finished the calamari and no sign of the wine. By the time the waiter (paolo) brought the wine, it was a little too late to enjoy it. I told the waiter that we would take 2 glasses instead of the complete bottle. After a few minutes the food came. It was a spicy pasta with chicken. Unfortunately,  the sauce tasted like sea food.  It was truly bad! The place is crowded,  the food is below average and the service is just as bad...find another restaurant. You will be happier going to an olive garden, macaroni grill or any other chain restaurant.

Bread is so important, I wish it was tastier.  The caesar salad was good. So I am not sure what we ordered specifically because we got a special deal or something and we just got bunch of food. We had a penne pasta with white sauce that included chicken, peas, dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. It looks good but it didn't have much flavor to it.   The chicken parmesan was good.   I wouldn't come back again if I had a smaller party and I'll go come again for a LARGE party (larger than 20) because family size makes it easier but it is a little bit pircey for mediocre food.  Note: They added 21% gratuity on our check.",

The veal parmesan was tough, chewy,  almost rubbery - and expensive.  Standard salad and cheese bread were fine.    Dinner for two of us, with small salad, small entree, small pasta, bread, no drinks, was nearly $80, before tip.  And, the restaurant is showing quite a bit of wear and tear.  The ceiling in the room where we were seated had a gaping hole in it.  Benches were lumpy.  Overall a big disappointment.  We aren't very excited about coming back.",

    "text": "So I have allowed some time for my last experience to digest and feel i can write an objective review.  I and my family have for 3 years gone to this restaurant for Thanksgiving.  Each year we have made a reservation in advance by at least one week.  Each year we have had to wait to be seated at least 20 minutes after are reserved time.  (Last year was 35 minutes)  As i sat and watched the front I noticed that people without a reservation were giving the exact same wait time as people that made reservation.  This is unacceptable, why would you take reservations if you are not going to honor the agreement and seat the people on time.  Why would you make someone that took the time and gave to courtesy of calling ahead wait as long as someone that did not bother.  Either accept reservations and make non-reservation wait longer or do not accept them and have everyone wait the same.  After we got seated we ordered drinks and an appetizer.  They brought me the wrong drink and after waiting 35 minutes brought the wrong appetizer.  Then the food arrived within two minutes of the appetizer (which we had returned for correction).  When they did bring us the correct appetizer it had almost no cheese on it and was luke-warm.    Overall the experience is not something we are planning to repeat.  So we have 1 year to find a new Thanksgiving location.",

It was a two ingredient drink, not something complicated. Anyway, I had a person who appeared to be the manager argue with me about my drink. I will not be going back and will tell my friends not to bother.  Oh, and the server had to add our bill up twice and it took at least 20 minutes to charge us.

What was supposed to be 30 minutes became close to an hour, on an average Sunday evening. We ordered the large so that we'd have leftovers for lunch the next day, since it's just me, my husband and my 3 year old. Sadly, there was no pasta included. Since when does chicken parm come without pasta? I had no idea. There is no explanation for why this meal is so expensive. The bread was like $13 and came with 4 slices of bread with a few leaves of spinach and a tiny bit of diced tomato mixed into the cheese. After waiting an hour and paying $50, it is ridiculous that my husband had to cook pasta to go with dinner. Very disappointed; will not be ordering again.",

We should up a little early and were shown to our table right away (we were a party of 12). Since I knew this was family style dining, ordered a large calamari, 2 large salads (antipasti and ceasar) along with baked ziti, pepperoni pizza and chicken. Salads came out OK. When we got our entre plates, half of them were dirty (you could see grease marks in the light and when running your hand over the plate, you could feel dried crusty things on it). After pointing this out to our waiter (who never bothered to introduce himself), he took our plates away to get new ones. In the meantime, we watched another server check the remaining dinner plates on their shelf by running her bare hand over all the plates. I don't know about you, but I was a little turned off by that. We were then given salad plates (guess all the dinner size plates had to be cleaned). Our main entres arrived without further incident. Another server who helped bring out the food asked if we would care for some red peppers - which we replied with \"yes, that would be great\". Red peppers never arrived. Same server (female) asked if we wanted more bread, which we replied with \"yes, we would like more bread\". She took our bread basket and disappeared - never to return! If you don't intend to bring anything back to our table, why do you ask? Upon paying our bill, we thought our server would return....nope! He disappeared also! We left disappointed with the service! Why would we spend so much money only to be ignored? It's not like the restaurant was packed with a waiting line. We will not be back!",

The entrance to the dining area is through their kitchen which I thought was super cool. The gentlemen in the kitchen were all super nice and respectful and welcomed us in. Our server was awesome!!! This place is great. We had their spicy chicken rigatoni and their cheese bread, both delicious!!  We will definitely be back again!!",

We placed a to-go order via phone, and when I arrived to pick up the order, it was pre-bagged, and all items were checked off (as if they were included). This $90 meal was ordered for my uncles birthday dinner, which included a Cesar salad (he's diabetic), and two other items. We were charged for the salad, but it was not included. Because he is on a strict diet, the salad was going to serve as the main part of his meal. Understanding that things happen, I called the restaurant within a few moments, and a male placed me on hold mid-sentence. I remained on hold for 5 minutes. After I gave up and disconnected, my mom and I repeatedly tried to call the restaurant for 1.5 hours, but no one answered the phone. It would ring and ring, then loop back to the automated system.   I recommend checking your bags yourself to ensure that all items are included, and going in person to speak to someone. Apparently the phone line isn't a priority here.",

All the dishes are prepared family style, serving either 3 or 5 people...with very good sized portions for each person. The three of us ordered two dishes, with the assumption that there would be a doggy bag, and there was. We had spaghetti and meatballs and Spicy Chicken Rigatoni. There was a basket of fresh bread included; we could have ordered a garlic bread as an extra side. The bread was very nice when served, but very dry by dinner's end. It was served with a mix of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but I asked for, and received butter to spread. I was not a fan of the meatballs. I am not sure why I did not care for them. It may have been simply the texture as they (2 large meatballs on our platter) were very soft, falling apart easily. The spaghetti was great. The chicken dish was much more to my liking as not only were the noodles easier to eat(rigatoni), but  it also had a nice seasoning in the sauce. There was a nice amount of bite-sized chicken pieces in the dish. There is a very funny part of the ad near the entrance to Buca. They advertise that they have a very nice bathroom. It was not a bad bathroom, but I have certainly seen nicer ones in many other restaurants.",

Not worth the $20.00 it costs to not even have a complimentary accompaniment to it like pasta or salad.

Obviously it was completely packed the first time I came in, I ordered a pasta dish with clams that had maybe 4 pieces of meat in the entire thing, it was good but for the price it definitely wasn't worth it.  The next time we decided to go all out between four people. We got two appetizers to split, one being a salad and the other a stuffed chicken breast. The stuffed chicken breast was amazing and we all agreed. Even the salad was very good...until we found a large horse fly after finishing almost the entire thing.  Now I'm not squeamish about finding insects in my food, in fact I'm pretty understanding and rarely even make a fuss about it but when we brought it to the server's attention we were treated like we were over reacting.  Again we probably wouldnt have over reacted had it not taken nearly half an hour to even get our appetizers, or if we had really been acknowledged in any way most of the time we were there. So we got a bit heated about the matter and the server was KIND enough to give us the salad for free, nothing else was comped in our order and the rest of the time we were there we were treated like they just wanted us to leave.   We hadn't been rude nor did we even demand anything be done about the fly but it made our entrees less than enjoyable. In fact I don't even remember what we got! Definitely won't be coming back to this place when there's infinitely better options out there.  It's just an overpriced rip off of Olive Garden that doesn't even taste as good, with poor service.",

    "text": "Had our service been anything better than pathetically bad, Buca would be a solid 3 stars.  So here's the deal on the service.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara.  That's what brought us in.  But we also ordered two appetizers and an entree to start with.  I commented that I thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring people in (give away a little spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu items).  His response was \"yeah, if people are like you and order other stuff, but if they just order spaghetti and water... (insert monotone robotic voice).\"  Well, okay then, he should be grateful we didn't do that.  Everything we ordered was terribly slow to come.  Kitchen's fault?  Maybe, but we notice where the other servers on the patio are coming and going, our server is rarely seen and when he is around, he's dragging his feet appearing to be on his way to the gas chamber.  Other than taking and delivering our order, he did nothing for us.  While not rude, he was not pleasant or overly friendly either.  The other guys on the patio helped us out with drink refills, clearing plates, etc.  After a long wait at the end of the meal, he returned remarking someone else was supposed to be helping.  We ordered dessert to go, another terrible wait, and asked our food be boxed.  Finally, he brings the dessert and realizes he never brought the leftovers.  Off he shuffles.  Upon returning, he says he's sorry about the wait.  Not half as sorry as he would be upon seeing his tip I'm sure.  As for the food, it's good, but nothing outstanding.  Even for family style plates, I think it's slightly overpriced.  When they say a small serves 2-3, that's 2-3 lunch sized portions.  If you're a \"healthy\" eater, count on 2.  Here's what we ordered:  Small garlic bread.  Really good bread slathered in fresh garlic, but $7.99.  Yes, it's a good sized basket, but it's still just garlic bread.  Perhaps bread should be offered at no charge.    Small mozzarella caprese.  Five nice thick slices of tomato with good quality cheese and whole basil leaves.  $9.99 but worth it.  Small spaghetti with marinara, normally $9.99 but free.  I would say this serves two for a main dish, three as a side.  Marinara was okay, nothing special.  Small chicken parmigiana.  Tasty but overpriced at $17.99 for two breasts IMO.  Remember it does not come with any pasta, just the chicken.  Tiramisu.  Best value at $9.95.  It's the size of a small pie and could easily serve four, but I didn't think it was fantastic.  It's a little too \"wet,\" like you could squeeze the cake and get a cup of coffee out of it.  We wanted to have a after-lunch drink, but the service turned us off to that.  Might come back, might not.",

Spent a good 30minutes on the phone to jut place my order ( as I was placed on hold 4 times ! ) I requested that my order be ready for med to pick up at 5.30pm . When I arrived to pick up - I was asked my name and asked to sit at the bar while they were getting my order out . I paid for my order and waited ! After about 20mins the bartender went to check 'what was taking so long' and came back and told me 'it should be out shortly' Another 15mins went by and when my order still had not come out, I asked what the delay was . To my disbelief - I was told now that ' my order was -not put in ' !!!  The manager came to talk and asked 'who ' I had had placed the order with /what time etc and I gave him all the details. Apparently the moron who took my order that morning had 'not placed the order' and now was conveniently 'gone' for the day. They had 'charged' me for someone else's order !!! By now it was 6.10pm - and there was no trace of my order ! My guests were to be arriving at my home by 7pm  ! The manager  , asked if I wanted to 'put the order in now ' , I really had NO choice at this point and asked if he could then have the food delivered. He promptly said \"No ! I don't have drivers that are free !!!' I had remained calm through this entire drama but by now was getting quite frustrated as it seemed like 'no one really cared !!' In the meanwhile -the lady who's order I had paid for -arrived to pick her food up. This was not ready either and she was 'over the top ' -creating a BIG scene !! The manager was visibly shaken and tried to calm her -apologizing etc... It was 6,40pm by now and I am still waiting for them to 'cancel ' the previous charges on my credit card and ring up my new invoice. The manager settled down the lady who 'making a big noise' first and then took care of my check. I asked for a confirmation to make sure the previous charges were void but was told 'I had to take his word for it- they was no print out to show me'. Manager now told me he was 'writing off two items from my order AND would deliver the food to my house after all !! It was almost 7pm and I to rush out as my guests were arriving at my house already !  The food did arrive to my house at 8.30pm missing the bread eventually !   I am extremely disappointed with how my situation was handled and how I was treated . I was there for almost  1 and a 1/2 hr !!! I am not one to 'scream' and 'demand' things or 'create a scene'  !! I understand that 'human errors' can happen and was really working with the team there to just make the best of my 'situation gone wrong' . It believe would have only been fair for them to have offered to have my order 'on the house' as this was totally the fault of their moron employee and the should have offered to deliver it right away !   Not only will I not go or order from Buca di Beppo but ALL my guests (25 + people) were horrified by this experience of mine and have vowed NOT to ever go there or order from there ever again .TOO BAD as ALL of us live around them and have OFTEN ordered for our large get togethers .",

Soe we got a couple of beers and an app and three meals for over a hundred clams after tax and tip.  So 1 star is deducted.    If you go there get the chicken saltimbocca.  Sheer delight!",

They always play Italian music and the last time I went, some mobster look-alikes were having a nice dinner before they went and wacked someone I'm sure.  The dishes are all big enough to share, so it's fun to order a few different dishes and then pass them around the table.    If you have a big enough party and you make reservations ahead of time, you can ask to be seated in the 'Pope' room.  There is actually a pope head in the middle of the table, and you can spin him around and if he happens to land on you, you're supposed to confess all of your sins. It's funny, I swear.",

However, some items are simply awful. Their chicken is crappy and their alfredo sauce is flavorless. Most of their dishes say \"chain\" to me. Their prices do not though.   I've ordered takeout from this place more than a few times - typically pizza. For 20 bucks, you get a lot of food. I actually really like their pizza - the pepperonis they use are the size of your fist. The Caesar salad here is gross. Hit or miss from dish to dish.   I have mixed feelings about Buca. I think I'm between a 3 and a 4 on this place... originally, I had this at a 4, but I'm now changing that to a 3. The service there is great and I really like the decor and atmosphere... it's just that the food can be so hit or miss.   The main issue here is that there are several italian restaurants in spitting distance that are heaps better. This place serves the needs of a special niche - large group dining. Take a friend here for a birthday bash. Have a family get together here. Dungeons and Dragons reunion meeting. Dinner for two? Forget about it...",

Everything is family style so dont be surprised when the prices look high, almost every portion serves between 2 and 5 people.  I went on a business dinner with 8 of us and service was great.  Since they are used to handling big groups of people, our orders were nothing new.  Nice to be able to have a good meal with lots of people and finally not complain about the service.  Decent wine selection, tasty desserts and a fun atmosphere.",

Our waiter Paolo was rude and inattentive. Both wine order and water refill request required reminders before they arrived. We received our appetizer twice. Thats right. They brought a very nice bruschetta. Ten minutes after we finished it, they brought another one, as if they had never seen us before. Later the waiter stopped by to say they were out of chicken and we needed to change our order. We switched to fett alfredo. Somehow it was cold when it got to us. And bland. No I mean very bland. When receiving the check we learned a probable cause for that- Paolo told us they had run out of cheese. I know, right? Italian Rest out of cheese? Paolo thought the reason was because they had been sending takeout orders out all day since 8 am. Said they had started receiving those orders over a month ago. That's right- the ONLY thing we must care about on Xmas day is your money. Shameful",

But lo and behold when I ordered cannolis, I was informed they had ran out!! How can you run out of cannolis!! So I was disappointed!!

There were 3 of us on a busy night and we had no reservations so we sat at the bar and waited for our table. The hostess taking names could've been a little more friendly or perhaps crack a smile but whatever, I wasn't here to make friends. The bartender was kinda bizarre. We thought we'd try a new dip on the menu but he quickly talked us out of it,saying that no-one ever finishes it. So we just didn't get anything because nothing else looked good. Then the same thing with a drink my friend ordered, he said not to try it. That nobody likes it. He did however make a suggestion for another drink that's more popular. We were seated in a room that was fairly warm. Not sure if they had the heat on 80 or what, but it was pretty hot in there. We had a ceaser salad, spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread. All delicious. Its family style so 1 large dish is plenty for 3-4 people. Nicole was our server and was awesome. Everything came out in a timely manner and she was super friendly even though they were crazy busy. The manager came by so that was great,too. So, usually we would've done dessert but it was just too much food and the desserts are huge too. I don't know that I'll come back but I wouldn't be opposed to it.",

    "text": "We ate here after my goddaughter's Confirmation and First Communion.  Reservations were made ahead of time for 17 people and the menu was selected ahead of time since we were a large group.  I've been to the Bucca in San Francisco, but it's been awhile so my review here does not have any reflection on that location.  When we first arrived, we were brought through the kitchen. I imagine it was supposed to be a tour of some sort. But, honestly, the hostess didn't tell us anything about the restaurant or why it would be any different than any other kitchen.  There was a booth in there. So, I guess that meant it is available if you wanted to sit in the kitchen to watch them prepare the food.  We were placed in a \"private\" room on the second floor that was long and I think they had three tables arranged end to end. There ended up only being 15 of us, so it would have been nice if they made more room my removing some of the chairs.  Every time the server came, she bumped into someone and most of the food was placed on one end of the tables since she couldn't fit to make it to the tables that were further in.  So, I give the accommodation two stars.  Since we ordered ahead of time, we would have thought that once the drinks were served, the first course of salads would have come out immediately.  Our reservation was for 1, we didn't get that first course until about 1:45.  What's the use of ordering ahead of time, if you are going to wait?  The main course of pasta dishes came out a little more quickly.  Refills were a bit slow coming out.  We asked for boxes for the leftovers (we had a lot of them) and you would have thought that dessert would have come out shortly after we had asked for the boxes.  But, they boxed up all the dishes first, put the bags aside and we waited another 10 minutes or so before she asked if the dessert should be brought out.  Again, what's the use of ordering ahead of time, if you are going to wait.  So, I give them two stars for service (I should also mention that it was not that busy so that it was understable for the long wait).  As for the food, it was pretty decent. There was certainly a lot of it since we ordered family style.  We probably would have been fine if we ordered half of what we actually got.  I imagine they based it based on the number of people, even though I don't think they should have counted the kids.  So, I would give the food three stars.  Overall, I would eat at this restaurant again. Can't say it's my favorite and that I would go out of my way for it.  But, I think it's an overall three stars.",

    "text": "All food is served family style and Meant to be Shared\"   This is one of those fun, themed, chain restaurants that manage to retain their unique identity, even though there are 51 other locations.  You would never guess that they all look just like the one you are in right now.   Okay, this restaurant is strictly for people with big appetites, a True love for starch, and lots of cheese (so, no atkins diet, lactose intolerant people please).  No need to list the assortment of classic Italian dishes like the Fettuccini , Lasagna, and Chicken Parmigiana, but one thing you must know: you have two choices between small and large portions.  Because this is family style dining, you either get a serving for 2-4 people, or 4-6.  This is traditional italian cooking, in a setting reminiscent of a devoutly catholic and Italian home. Pictures of the pope, Joe DiMaggio, Sophia Loren, and everyone Italian, are everywhere.  The particular location we visited had over 2,000 photographs on the wall.   There is unique seating throughout the restaurant.  Reserve a table in the kitchen (seats 6-10), or for large parties, reserve the \"Pope's Table\" that seats 12-18.  With upstairs and downstairs seating, there is plenty of room, and each corner of the restaurant will give you something to feast your eyes on.   Everything Italian, you can hear traditional Italian Folk music overhead, or classic Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.   My Favorite: Antipasti: Garlic Bread  with Mozzarella.     5.95 (small) like a pizza pie of bread, with whole garlic cloves and plenty of mozza Entree: Chicken with Lemon       13.95 (SMALL) two tender pieces of chicken breast, doused in a lemony caper sauce. I get it every time I come here.   go to the website, and they list the entire menu.  see their list of accolades, or make a reservation online!",

    "text": "I went for dinner when I was in town for business and therefore, I was alone. Seeing that I often go to the bar to eat, I was a bit put off when there were absolutely zero people in the bar area... the entire night. That's probably because the bar is completely removed from the restaurant. So that right there sort of made me feel a bit awkward, not even being able to feel the vibe of the rest of the place.   I'll start off that I've been to Buca several times at different locations and have always love the atmosphere, food, vibe, etc. So please note this review is only for this particular Buca.   I started with a cocktail (sorta bland and weak) and ordered a Caesar salad and baked ravioli. The bartender was kind enough to remind me the portions are large and said I could even order off the lunch menu. I really appreciated that. He then brought out some boring soft bread (a la Subway) with flavorless olive oil. I decided to wait for something better.   The Caesar was OK.. nothing better than any average Caesar you would get anywhere else. Probably even less interesting than the store bought Cardini dressing I buy at the supermarket. The croutons were the best part.   The baked cheese ravioli was pretty good. They came in a fresh marinara sauce with melted mozzarella cheese on them. The sauce was a nice fresh balance to the heavier cheese, though the ravioli themselves were light and very nice.   Oh, I also had a glass of their 'best' Chianti by the glass.. ugh.. tasted like two buck chuck.. I don't think so, especially if you're an Italian restaurant.   Overall, three stars for OK.. nothing special, I probably won't go back but won't discourage anyone else. I'm sure I'll check out another Buca again, just not this one.",

    "text": "Went with a friend last night. First time. In my limited experience for restaurants, this is the best Italian food I've ever had. We ordered a apple gorgonzola salad with walnuts and raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Best salad I've ever had. For an appetizer we had calamari that my friend wanted. I've only had it a couple of times at other restaurants and never was impressed. Now I'm impressed. The texture was different than the thin dried crunchy calamari I've had before. Loved the marinara sauce. Had a slight kick to it. Then we had the lasagna. Loved the taste, I don't know if it was the sauce or cheese but it had a taste I've never had in lasagna before. My favorite lasagna ever so far. Our waiter was upbeat and returned numerous times to check on us. Lots of families eating there. I knew it was going to be good when I had to circle parking lot looking for a place to park. Finished the meal off with chocolate cake. Just found out there is another location in east mesa close to home. I hope its as good as the Scottsdale location. Thought it was going to be overpriced until I saw the small portions were for 2 people and the large was for 4. Generous portions. I don't know how anyone single can eat there though as I didn't notice anything smaller for 1 person.",

She gets manager Joshua Gleason to help. He plays with it for about 5 mins and restarts it. Waited for the reboot and still not working. Food is sitting on cart. She finds Joshua again. We have now been here for about 20 mins. He plays with the computer and can't get it to work. Nice girl walks away, Manager does not offer an apology, acknowledge our presence, says nothing to me. He took my card and walked away. Finished the transaction elsewhere and returns my card to girl in the takeout area. Who passes it to me. Very poor example for his employee who was very nice. He never offered an apology, a dessert, a discount. But first and foremost an apology. I was VERY disappointed with his actions. When my kids were teenager and had friends over, I ordered lots of food from Buca in Chandler. They are adults now, and servings are too large. So I haven't been back in a while. I will not return to the Scottsdale store again.",

With 4 kids and a tight wallet my wife and I look for place where kids eat free or the food is cheap and plentiful. While Buca doesn't offer kids free food they do offer GREAT food at a reasonable price with portions large enough to SHARE and SPARE.   The dinning experience is great! The restaurant is split into semiprivate rooms with only a few tables in each space. There is a real family feel here! Although, the photo's and art that decorates the walls have sparked some interesting conversations with my 7 year old the decor is really fun!   I certainly recommend this restaurant!",

There were 20 of us for a party so therefore there were a variety of plates and I had the opportunity to try several of their entrees.   I just couldn't eat the stuff it was so bad.

It was completely inedible.  Other people at our table that ordered it agreed and couldn't eat theirs as well.  I mentioned it to the server and she shrugged it off.  The chicken was decent - not great, but not bad.  When the check came, she had made no effort to take off the soup.  What great customer service!  Before posting on here, I complained privately to corporate.  They clearly don't care about customer service because my complaint was ignored.  If you are looking for medium end Italian food, Olive Garden or Carrabbas are heads and tails above this place.  AVOID!",

Reserved via OpenTable and check in was quick and we were seated about 5 minutes before our time even though the place was packed.   We ordered a family Salad and as we were all about to eat it my 9 year old noticed something on her fork full of lettuce.... A bug.   I examined it closely and sure enough it was one.   So I told a passing waiter who apologized and asked if we wanted another salad.   We declined... Since we figured all the salad had come from the same source.   The manager eventually came over and assured us that we'd be \"taken care of.\"  He said... The \"salad is on the house.\"  My wife said... \"That's good because we didn't eat it,\" and we waited for an offer to maybe comp something else.   The owner explained... It probably came from the supplier that way and he hopes we understand.   I won't say that the bug in our salad totally ruined our meal... But I thought the manager could have done more to make sure we returned as customers.   As of right now... I won't be returning.",

THE FIRST VISIT: After skimming through a friends photo album on Facebook, I saw that they ate here and I decided to give it a try! I went on a Wednesday afternoon with my boyfriend for some early lunching!  I ordered the Linguine Frutti de Mare, its light and hits the spot for pasta and seafood! There are like a gazillion baby clams in that dish I swear. My boyfriend ordered a ton of stuff but I don't remember... He throughly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best Italian food outside his mother's cooking! (He also mentioned that he'd never eat at Olive Garden after coming here.)  Even after we were pretty much stuffed and ready to be wheeled out by our soft spoken and chipper waitress, we had to try the cheesecake, because I love cheesecake.  It arrived, and the first spoonful of the stuff was heavenly, it was rich and almost heavy, but it just ... Melts in your mouth, that it doesn't matter that you're probably gonna weigh six thousand pounds after the meal. It had roasted hazelnuts and raspberry sauce slathered all over it, oh god, I'm probably going to have to go tomorrow... And order TWO slices of cheesecake. Haha!  My first time here was amazing, our waitress was very attentive and humorous. The second time wasn't so awesome, but I'll cut the waiter that we got some slack because it got really busy really fast compared to the quiet lunch I had the first time. The second time our drinks were empty almost 75% of the time and that's no bueno in my book.  The only reason I will come back is for the cheesecake. I hope that stays consistent.",

We passed two trays loaded with multiple plates of food, someone could have easily been injured. The table we were sat at had dirty menus which left my hands sticky so I went to wash them in the men's room. In the restroom were countless photographs of nude men and naked toddler aged boys. The picture about the urinal was of two young boys with their rear ends out. There was also a picture of a naked boy urinating in a fountain. Absolutely profain! Our waiter, Alex, forgot to bring our house bread and extra lemons. He also neglected to refill our drinks. We were told the portions were family sized which limited our options as there were only two of us. The garlic bread was dry. The prosciutto stuffed chicked was not very stuffed. All I tasted was the chicken even though it was sitting in some sort of cream sauce. The only positive was that the food came out quickly which was good because we couldn't wait to leave. Two stars is honestly generous.",

The servers were every attentive and friendly and the food was very good. And the portions were really huge! Most of us ended taking home part of our orders.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is very casual and the low level of lighting make for a more relaxed mood during dinner. One of my main complaints about dining places in Scottsdale - especially in the Old Town section of Scottsdale Rd. - is that parking is difficult to find, but that does not apply to this restaurant. In addition to the parking areas surrounding the building, the restaurant has additional parking just across on the southern side of 1st Street, and of course there are additional parking spaces on 1st Street itself.",

It was disgusting. The salt and pepper shakers were so gross!  We paid about $30 per plate for bland, unimpressive pasta and chicken. The marinara was tasteless. The chicken parmesan was soggy, The chicken limone was bland (mine is way better). We could have gone to a nice steak house for this price! The service was so bad. Every time the server left the table, we knew we wouldn't see him for a good 10-15 minutes, which was frustrating when he took the dirty serving spoon and said he would be back with a clean one, or when he took two of our dirty plates and said he would be back with clean ones, but never returned. We ended up stealing supplies from the dressed tables nearby. It took over 2 hours to have dinner because of his slow service. We were all so tired and really didn't want to be there that long. The tiramisu was nice, but the giant Sunday was about 50% whipped cream with bad ice cream. They sang to our daughter and had her blow out the candelabra of broken candles - very tacky.  The bathrooms were in disrepair with doors that didn't shut or lock.  We will not be returning to Buca Di Beppo.",

The only change is we added artichoke and spinach. Neither of us cared for the spinach or artichoke. In my opinion the artichoke did not taste good and was kind of sour.

Since it was just the two of us, we only ordered one dish - a chicken cantelloni made with spinach and a rose sauce. It was a quality choice. We also enjoyed mozzarella garlic bread which was in my opinion, the best part.  Only downfall to this place would be the slow service we experienced and the delay in getting us seated and waited on.

    "text": "For Mother's Day my folks wanted us all to go here.  My mom made reservations 3 weeks ago for a group of 20 people at 1pm for a private room.  The group setting was 10 adults and 10 kids. We got there (our whole party of 20) at 12:55 and they told us it would be a few minutes until we would be seated.  Well that turned into a long wait.  We did not sit down until 1:45PM.  I spoke with the manager and he said there was nothing he could do until the other table got up.   He did say he would get us a couple appetizers so they would be ready when we sit down. The thing I don't understand is if you have a reservation confirmed for 20 at 1PM why did they put someone at that table? Maybe they thought these people would be done in time for our 1PM.   And why should anyone wait 45 minutes for their table to be ready when they have reservations?    So we sit down at 1:45 with 10 adults at one table and 10 kids at another.  We got some appetizers and salads and food.   The servers did a good job.  The slow kitchen wasn't their fault.  I give this place 2 stars for the food.  Our bill came and the manager only gave us a few appetizers as a comp.  We asked to talk to the Manager.  At that point it was an assistant manager who really seemed like he had no clue what was going on in the restaurant and said he needed to talk to the general manager for a larger comp. We waited for 15 minutes for the GM to finally make it to our table.  The manager did end up taking more off the total bill but did not earn our business of 20 people to come back.  They really dropped the ball from reservation delay to slow kitchen service. The real problem with this place is lacking in management across the board from our experience.",

Not enough garlic. Plenty of fat but not olive oil or butter. Some bland vegetable oil--all the calories and none of the flavor.",

Sometimes you get the servers that want to rush you, but he didn't. He let us take our time and enjoy our meal. They made our experience a great and unique one! Also, as a tip, get the large portion of the pasta dish you get, while I would suggest lasagna, any dish is good, and take the rest home! We're gonna have lunch or dinner for a few days! Lol! Good bang for your buck when you look at it that way!",

Although we had visited Buca many times our dining experience at the Buca in Scottsdale was unmatched!  Their entire staff was timely and professional.    Our waitress' name was Limah.  She was super generous and made sure we were taken care of the whole time we were there.  She had great understanding of the food and drink menu.  She actually suggested my wife to try the Shrimp Florentine while I had the spaghetti and meatball (basic I know), but both meals came out great along with a hot fresh order of garlic bread.    All in all, my wife and I truly enjoyed our dining experience at this Buca location. Next time we are in town we will surely be back!",

Honestly this is our 3rd time here, now we just say don't expect the server to come over anytime soon. Sad this is a known standard of this place. I also had to get new silverware since there was food stuck on them. Maybe they should check that before setting the table. We started with the small calamari for $16.99. I get it's a small but 10 little, emphasis on the little, rings of calamari for $17!!!! That's a joke. Def don't order this!!! They were also burnt. So double the bad value.  Now I will say since we have been here a few times there must be a reason we have returned despite the bad service. The pasta is actually great. The Rosa sauce has a perfect flavor and the family size portion is a great value. This place would have a lot better reviews if they could get the service together",

Meatballs are the size of your head and the tomato sauce tasted more like freshly canned tomatoes rather than one that has been cooked down to stew..  But boy, the portions are HUGE!  We also had the penne with chicken & sundried tomato in cream sauce.  The pasta was cooke al dente and the flavors worked really well together in this dish.  And the chopped salad?  Good.  Stuffed mushroom?  Ok, but the pesto sauce outshined the mushrooms.  Needless to say, we stuffed ourselves silly but still took leftover home to last for a week.  My nephew was happy and had the biggest smile when the entire dining room sang happy birthday to him.  This is a fun restaurant and a great place to celebrate a birthday!!",

Service was fine, but my issue is paying $20 for spaghetti and meatballs and not getting a sald? I mean, come on....the pasta was box-like, nothing special, sauce your basic marinara. I just expected more as I was told this is the BEST spaghetti in AZ. If so, stick to the AZ fast food circuit and use your savings for a trip to NY/NJ where pizzerias serve the same thing for $7.95. With a sald. And hot garlic bread. real bread. I won't even go there. I guess when peopl e are in Scottsdale-Spend mode, they don't care about adding $10 for a side sald.  Food was okay, My search for the best spaghetti and meatballs goes on. As far as the rest of the meal, all good, all overpriced, none NYC quality.",

Our waiter was pretty bad, acted like he didn't want to be there, and at one point when someone FINALLY got his attention after attempting to flag him down twice to ask for a drink refill he actually snarled his lip a bit!   The food. Some was really good, some was really bad. I had the Caesar salad, it was salad, its hard to mess up. I also had a piece of the plain bread...its really \"doughy\". For the main course there was the chicken Marsala which was very sweet, almost to sweet. The baked zitti tasted pretty spot on and was the best of the three. Lastly there was the fettuccine Alfredo, holy blob of white tasteless pasta. I salt and peppered and added more grated parm to it and it still lacked flavor, it was beyond gross.   For dessert there was cheese cake and chocolate cake. The cheese cake had no crust but was decent. The chocolate cake was pretty moist and good.   Will I go back here again? Only if invited by someone else and they are paying, no way would I put my own money towards this place.",

My spaghetti was as cold as Antarctica and my server was as equally terrible. She happened to spill the whole water pitcher on my lap. I would like to say the food made up for the inconvenient service, nut every bite made me hate the place even more.  When I first walked in it has a weird setup. You must walk through the kitchen to get to your table. That is a bit odd but nothing that would make me dislike it. The people there were nice accept my waitress. She had quite the attitude. Once again that does not mean that the whole place is terrible nor the food. Like I said I gave it chances, but they fell through in every category. The food was cold with no flavor. It was a real annoyance and definitely makes me never want to go back to this place again. This was a waste of time and money and gets two thumbs down.",

There were 9 of us for very special 15th birthday party dinner for Ashley.  We also broke Stan (Ashleys Grand Ffather) out of his rehabillitation facility to join us as a family meal would not be complete without him.  For dinner and we had a slew of food, all of which was great as expected, see below.   The down side was the service.  It was just terrible!  The waitress added in the 18% gratuity so knowing full well she was going to get paid well for a large party, paying attention to us was a second thought.  There were far too many other tables to attend to where the gratuity would have to be earned and not just added on automatically.    Both Melissa and Ryan had to play \"waitress/waiter\" and get refills for our water and ice tea, as if this was something they were reuired to do.  Where was our waitress?  Who knew?  As far as the food goes, we had 2 trays of Calimari, Cheesey Garlic Bread and a large mixed salad.  Delicious!  For the entree we chose Lobster Spaghetti, Chicken Carbonara and Baked Ziti.  Again, Delicious!  The Carbonara was the bomb!!    The food alone is what allows this to rate a 2 star evening.  The service tore it apart and stopped any kind of positive statement to be made.  Sorry guys, you need to get your wait staff in check.    We brought  our own dessert, a store bought birthday cake which allowed us to opt out of their offerings.  They are usually quite good though!  Overall, I still love this place for the quality of the food and will certainly go back.  Lets see how they change by the next time we all return.  Enjoy!!",

They tell you that they downsize the entrees for the lunch specials. That's a lie. They still bring you a full-sized dish. If you've ever been to Buca, you know that a full-sized dish is perfect for two people.  I had soup, salad, and a side of spicy sausage in a marinara sauce. Super delicious and very filling. If i wasn't trying to be good, I would've tore up some rigatoni or baked lasagna. I went with a party of 8 and it was terribly tempting. Everything smelled delicious and I heard nothing but good things about the taste.   I was surprised by the prices as well. I would recommend splitting a \"Buca small\" entree with someone. Cheaper, and you'll still have enough to chow. Perfect for a lunch out with your co-workers. The only downfall was the timing. An hour long lunch turned into a 1.5 hour long lunch. The size of the group was a factor, I believe. If I go back for a lunch, it will be for a lunch on the weekend sometime.",

    "text": "I went to this location while visiting my sister in law. I lived in AZ 16 years and never went until I came back in town to visit. I think my first note is that the food is \"Family Style.\" Meaning, the portions are LARGE, so you can't order something just for yourself without having a bunch of leftovers. You will need help, bring a hungry army hahaha.   Parking is ok. Its old town Scottsdale, you have a lot of different nighttime activities and bars going on right in that area. Buca has the parking adjacent to the building, they have additional parking across the street next to Salty Senoritas. Then there's also parallel parking on the street. I always found that parking was good in Old Town Scottsdale, so this was no exception.  Our server was named Steve, he was super helpful and fun, he fit into the ambiance. The christmas lights are up around the perimeter year-round. Inside, the christmas lights are also up with what can only be described as a cluster*duck of pictures, statues, random things you might find at your grandma's house, and the Pope. There was a Cardinal's hat (the Catholic kind, not the football kind) in a display case near where we sat. The pictures were old, some were funny, it was a good time.       Anyway, we get seated in the back, there was a party of 20 leaving. I should have took that as a sign. Me and my fiance ordered the Short Rib Orecchiette in a \"small\"... they said it feeds 3, and we were like \"that should be enough for us\" but OMG that bowl was huge. The SMALL is big. My sister in law (future) orders chicken parmesan. Note - the chicken parm in the small is three big chicken breasts and sauce, but no noodles... which is odd if I'm being honest. And there was no way to order just noodles without another big bowl of something coming out. So her and her eldest son shared the chicken parm and had a side of just spaghetti and red sauce, which was also BIG. Her youngest was probably the closest to having a normal sized dinner. He ordered the kids pepperoni pizza (he's 6 years old at the time). However, the kids pepperoni pizza has tomatoes on it, and he doesn't like tomatoes chunked like that. So, Steve took it back with not judgement (kids will be kids, right?). He brought back a mac and cheese, which looked PERFECT. However, the kid just played with his food, it's fine. I had to get past that, kids will be kids.         Since there were 5 of us, we got the large garlic bread. Mind you, all of this we ordered thinking \"sure, a place will say it feeds X number of people but there's never enough for everyone....\" Hear me when I say \"if they say it feeds 3\".. BELIEVE IT. The portions are HUGE. You need a solid number of people committed to the same dish to get through it. Me and my fiance were leaving the next day, and we ate 2 rounds of leftovers from Buca and only made a dent. I would also say the food was better the next day, but that isn't a commentary of Buca but on Italian food in general. Overall, if you go, just make sure you bring your eating pants and your eating buddies.",

Ordered about $200 worth of food \"to go\"  Suppose to get: Cesar salad, calamari, Mac n cheese bites, garlic bread, spinach and artichoke dip, chicken Marsala, and penne alla vodka, along with the desert option.   The penne vodka and cheesecake were the only good things in the whole order of $175   Get home to find no calamar in the bag but instead some friend mozzarella ball thing. Chicken Marsala was so dry and over cooked. Spinach and artichoke dip was bland.  It was such a disappointment. I called about the calamar and they gave me a $15 credit.  It wasn't worth calling about the other things because they wanted me to drive back to get the calamari and did not even offer to deliver it.  Unfortunately do not think I would be going back anytime soon.",

We had to circle around once.  Inside it's classic Buca.  Same decor, same feel.  The food also was typical Buca.  Much better than other Italian chains in most regards.  It does help to have a coupon, and they issue them frequently.  Meatball Monday is a 50% promo, which really takes the sting out of their pricing.  I believe we had a BOGO lunch this time, but we also recently did Meatball Monday here.  I don't think we ever come to a Buca without a coupon or promo.  Good food, adequate service.  Yes, I remain a fan.  One of the few chains about which I can say that.",

It was amusing to see a booth in the middle of the kitchen with folks dining. It's family-style ordering, so we went with the mozzarella garlic bread to start and the apple Gorgonzola salad for the table. The salad was great, loaded with Granny Smith apples, walnuts, goat cheese, cranberries and greens. We definitely finished the large size (serves 5, we were 7).  For our main entrees, we ordered the chicken saltimbocca, shrimp fra diavolo, and the spicy chicken rigatoni. The first one had a strange texture, a bit wet from the sauce, but I liked the capers. The second two dishes used red pepper to add spice and they were good. I'm not a big fan of pasta in general but the portions were generous and we even had some to take home. Service was prompt and the environment was loud but joyful, with several birthdays and prom celebrations. The deserts looked tasty but we were too stuffed from the food, maybe next time.",

I showed my waiter the coupons I was using right when we sat down and he said he would take them off at the end. I had a )20 coupon they emailed me and the free kids meal.

The girl I placed the order w was extremely polite & super sweet. No complaints on the customer service, it was just the food. The quality just wasn't there. Paid $50 for two orders of Caprese. That was just part of our order, but as you can see the tomatoes were old and we had to toss them out.

Everything was just bland and dry, maybe because it was a big rehearsal dinner, but still. Being that Bucca di Beppo is in downtown Scottsdale and parking is horrendous, we probably won't be going back anytime soon.",

We went for Thanksgiving dinner which is a good value at about 55 bucks for 3 people, however it was served room temperature and the waitress forgot the cranberry sauce, so we had to flag her doin the bar and the bartender was talking so loud it was distracting. The feel is a bit like Oregano's, but with big expensive family portions, so be ready to split menu items, and take a doggy bag home. The host has a spiel about walking through the kitchen that plays like a broken record if you sit near the entrance. They are open on holidays which is a plus, and probably the only time we will go there.",

Had to flag down our server to get it. She threw 2 settings on the table and left ( there were 5 of us). 5 min later brought 3 more sets. She said she would bring bread with dipping oil.  Got the bread, no oil, no butter.  Flagged down a server, asked for for the oil....got it with Parmesan cheese that looked like powder.  Asked for butter, got three pats!  The Apple Walnut Salad looked fantastic but had little to no dressing.  Couldn't find a server to ask for more.  We ordered Chicken Lemone and Veal Parm.  The portion sizes of both were small and we had to send it back because it was tough and served cold.  Hardly ever saw our server.  We flagged down anyone we could to get what we needed.  When we tried to pay the bill and leave it took forever to get our check.  We were there over 2 hours and the meal was terrible.  For what it cost us we could have had a great meal in a 5 star restaurant!  Will never, ever go back!",

First, we had to wait for a seat for about 20 minutes (at 8:00 PM). It seemed that we were being avoided. We then get seated and immediately place our food order along with our drinks. There was a large birthday group across from us but I figured since we were just ordering spaghetti that we wouldn't have to wait an extremely long amount of time. As we wait and completely understand that there is a large group ahead of us, we ended up sitting there waiting for just SPAGHETTI for 30 minutes. Then the manager comes over and said, \"oh we made a mistake on your order and it will be ready in about 10 minutes. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR SPAGHETTI. We ended up just leaving without our food. And with an extremely hungry 2 yr old. There was no \"hey let me give you a voucher for next time or hey I'm really sorry about that\", nothing. I will never go to this restaurant every again and will never suggest it to another person.   This actually happened at the location on Val Vista about a month ago as well. Horrible service.",

    "text": "Last minute decided to go out for dinner instead of cooking and did a quick look through of Groupons and found one for Buca $10 for $20 of food. Great we thought we won't spend so much money! Wrong.. Totally wrong the service was ok, water cups got pretty empty, server didn't seem to know the menu very well but she was nice and pleasant.  Food was ehh nothing super or even great. Ordered a side of broccoli so the kids could have some vegetable with their super greasy pizzas but the broccoli is made with red chili peppers and I think the server should have let us know that. It burned my 2 year olds little mouth the second she tasted it. I tried it after and it was stupidly spicy. If a side dish is going to be so spicy it should have been clearer on the menu. The manager came by and said they took care of that off the bill, which was nice I didn't have to ask. My sister ordered just the mushroom Marsala sauce and pasta with no meat and at first they sent out just pasta with very little Marsala sauce but no mushrooms. 20 minutes later they brought the mushrooms and sauce. The sauce was tasty but with cold noodles not so much. The veggie pizza was decent, again nothing exciting. Big waste of money for one eh not so great meal.   Update! I was contacted by the regional manager who was really apologetic and convinced me to give Buca another chance. He was very sincere and cares a great deal about his restaurants and the customers so we will be giving them another shot and hoping for a better visit. Was really impressed that I was actually contacted by someone and that they wanted to make it a better experience for my family. Will have a new review after our visit!",

That's alright because it is a busy day for restaurants. So that is understandable. What really irritated me was that I requested a booth and it was confirmed via internet AND phone that there would be a booth available for us. But when it came down to sitting down, there was no booth. I asked and they said none were available...even when I pointed to one across from me. The hostess said they need them to seat more people. Ten minutes later, a couple is seated there. I don't know if you can understand my frustration but that made me livid. Our waitress hardly checked on us. Water was always empty. Her personality was the same as cardboard. Overall, food was great. Service and seating was terrible at this location. I definitely have had better experiences with this chain at other locations.",

I was looking into various restaurants to host a party with hor dourves, drinks, ect. The person form the catering called me and immediately gave me bad vibes - not friendly and valley-girl accent. After discussing prices, I told her that I thought Buca would be out of our price-range for the type of party I was trying to accomplish. She proceeded to ask me what my budget was. Keep in mind, I am paying for the entire party and guests will not be buying their own food. When I told her my \"small\" budget, her valley-girl response was \"Ouch\"! And then she seemed very annoyed and short with me for the rest of our short conversation. This is not how you keep returning customers. Just because my budget for this particular event was low, it does not mean that future events that I host, won't have a much higher budget. Hire someone more friendly and down to earth please. I am tired of the Scottsdale snobbery.",

Four stars because you get to walk through the kitchen when you come in and they bring a wine bottle with the menu, I love not having to wait for wine.

Im used to eating spicy and very spicy food but when all you can taste in a mountain of over priced pasta is red pepper flakes until your mouth is numb is ridiculous. I did not notice it in the beginning because of the sauce. I told the server and a concerned manager came out saying something about they had other complaints and that they were training new cooks. Instead of comping the dish they brought me a doggy bag of the same crap ( probably without red pepper flakes) but who knows cause it went into the trash as soon as i left. Omg the heart burn and gastric issues ive been having. To be fair service was ok. Btw for the same $50 average per person you can eat a block away at a delicious place ( the mission), if you can find a table. Bucca is going down in flames and very fast.",

I knew I loved the arrowhead location, so for Thanksgiving my friend and I decided to go here, and for Xmas eve my friend and I decided to return with her out of state family in hand.  The out of towners loved the place, said they never knew it existed until then.  They believed the staff to be friendly as well, and stated that they would look for one in their home state and they hoped it was as nice and friendly as our Arizona one.  They also loved the location, surrounded by old town Scottsdale, great places to walk around if you're into taking a little stroll after your meal.  Both times I've been to this location I made sure to do reservations because I know how busy they get and how the lines get long and ridiculous, which should say something right there on how good they are if that many people are willing to wait an hour or more sometimes.  With reservations in hand, we didn't even have to wait a minute both times, they sat us immediately when we showed up.  Each time we had multiple courses of food, shared of course since the portions are large.  And both times the waiters were right there, they were anticipating our completion of a meal between the 3 courses to make sure the next was out shortly.  So there you have it, friendly staff, no wait if you get a reservation, amazing yummy food, and affordable!!!  Geez, was it nice and cheap!",

    "text": "Bucca di Beppo advertises Italian family style dining....well, I don't know much about Italian families, but I know there wasn't enough food for my Jewish family.  The way the sizing works at Bucca di Beppo is that a small dish feed 3 and a large dish feeds 6...except that those numbers are not very accurate.   My family was celebrating my grandmothers 75th birthday and this was the only place she would even consider going. She loves the atmosphere and she loves the food. I understand where she is coming in those regards. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting  (4/5) and the food is pretty decent Italian fare (3/5-a little skimpy on the sauce). It's really just the amounts I protested.  Our party of 9 ordered 1 large dish and 4 small dishes. By Bucca di Beppo's logic, that amount of food should feed 18 people and yet my family was scrounging for food by the end. We all expected to walk away from that table completely stuffed and regretting that meal the next morning when we stepped on the scale, but we all walked out feeling pretty light and not at all regretful.  My problem is not with the food at this restaurant, but with their measurements. I think I'll go back to Bucca di Beppo, but this time I'll come knowing that I need to order much more than they recommend.",

I'm sick of being penalized with waits or reservations when a group of friends and I want to go out to eat at the last minute. Buca De Beppo however is different. With a family style menu and a mansion of a restaurant I have always got in very quickly.   As I mentioned the menu is made to be ordered in either medium or large portions. The Medium portions are for about two or three people and the large are more around four or five. Last time I was there we had polenta and garlic breadf or appetizers. For entrees we had Caesar salad, chicken parmesan, and the manacotti. This was for six starving people. The chicken Parmesan is unlike any I have had. Instead of a basic fried chicken breast they  grill it and top it off with fresh tomato sauce and a little sprinkled cheese. The manacotti was also delicious and the cheese was so filling I could barely finish one.   Our waitress was a bit flighty but she was nice. The ambiance of Buca is also very interesting you won't spend a dull moment at your table because the walls are engrossed with quirky photographs.",

He was so kind and cheerful, the food was warm, great taste, didn't take forever to cook and the icing on the cake was when we left our keys way at the back out the restaurant and he chased after us to bring them out to us. We will be back, the service is great, the food is amazing, great fun and amusing decor, and the staff really just seals the deal on this location. Thanks for a great time!",

Since we had reservations there and nowhere else to go, we decided to stick it out. The food took every bit of two hours and them some.  It was Christmas, I was not about to be nasty like some of the other grouchy people around us. (PEOPLE, YOU WERE WARNED).   In fact- I heard the host/manager telling \"everyone\" as they were checking in for their reservations that \"your food will take a LONG time, be prepared.\" Clearly some people thought he was joking around.  I feel our server Colin did the best he could, he was serving tables, working the bar and generally running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Our son fell asleep waiting. We laughed about it. Colin kept our coffee hot. We made him smile, I could tell he wanted to hang himself. I thought about his family and how they probably wanted to spend Christmas with him and he's dealing with us idiots instead.  Merry Christmas to the staff that was working so hard and basically abused by the public. I feel for you. I probably will just stay in and cook next year. People are mean.  I knocked off a few stars because the food was \"average\". Certainly not Mom's lasagne, but not Stouffer's either.",

    "text": "Ridiculous. Was given the option when making reservations for 6:15pm or noon for thanksgiving dinner. Arrive at 6:09pm for our party of 2 reservations at 6:15pm and told 30-45 min wait. What's the point of reservations? I have myself and my disabled mother. No place for her to sit. Just had surgery for brain cancer and the hostess couldn't even give us a seat at the bar. We have been this establishment as a thanksgiving tradition for 7 years now, between the Scottsdale location and Seattle. This will be the last year we continue this tradition due to the fact that you have to wait 45 minutes after your reservation. Very unprofessional. Disappointed to say the least. I only make these reservations to take my mom here because she loves this place even though they have mediocre Italian food.  Had to edit this review. We were seated 30 minutes after our reservation. While walking through the kitchen to be seated, a server turned around and ran into my disabled mother and her walker. She then got yelled at by another staff. The table we were sat at was set for 6 people when only 2 of us, the first chair I grabbed was broken as well as the chair my mom sat in. This place has gone down hill. Would compare this place to a Denny's.  7:51pm... no food yet. Took 45 minutes to get out appetizer. We're now 10 minutes past the time our server told us our food would be out at max... normally I wouldn't complain but this is thanksgiving.. not a single face in here looks happy and all we're hearing about is \"how busy we are..\"  Update, food arrived 1.5 hours after we were sat 30 minutes late. Stuffed shells were hard and over done with barely any cheese on top. The stuffed prosciutto chicken had barely any prosciutto inside and was extremely dry. Server took it back. The bread was all cold, frozen butter... desert took 15 minutes to arrive when ordered. Been to these establishments all over the USA, this will be the last time we ever visit. Terrible food, terrible service, terrible management due to the under staffed holiday.",

It was nice to look at all the pictures on the walls :) After looking at the menu we decided to get the fried calamari as an appetizer. It was a decent amount and the sauce was good. I was pleased with this dish. For my main entree I decided on the spaghetti with meat sauce... It took about 20-30 minutes to get to me, I am a patient person but I was really hungry... But I didn't let that bother me :) I got the Small dish thinking it was just a plate and boy, it was a bowl to feed 3 people at least... By this time I was a little full of bread, water, and calamari... But I did like the flavor of the sauce as well as the noodles... I was satisfied with my spaghetti...  Next time I know to take more people and split dishes :) there seems to be a lot of reviews with complaints on proportion so we will keep that in mind...   Ps one of the strawberry desserts looked awful yummy! I need to try it next time!",

As cool as the family style can be, it really seems like it's never easy to decide with everyone or do the math on the appropriate amount of food. I've never left there without multiple extra boxes. Perhaps I just need to go more to adjust my models for Bucca di Beppo ordering? Haha. I suspect this is just built into their business model.  Their food is good, but not amazing. I don't know why I always think it's going to be better than it is. My favorite is the margherita pizza, but you can certainly get better pizza lots of other places in town. In terms of any of the other dishes, same deal. If you have a big party, Bucca di Beppo is perfectly pleasant place to go.",

    "text": "The okay: The food was decent, albeit extremely overpriced. EXTREMELY. $24 for a 2-person portion of chicken, with nothing on the side? Seriously? Ridiculous.   The good:  Our server (bigger guy with long hair) was awesome and very good at dealing with 10 people who needed to eat and be out in 1 hour. He gets 5/5.  The manager I spoke to today was pleasant. Gave me the impression that he is used to handling Snottsdale people with kid gloves.  The reasons we will not return:   I would advise the owner to check out their booking practices, and perhaps do some drug testing on their employees.     1) My friend made a reservation and we were supposed to have the pope room. My boyfriend and I arrived first and were at the bar when a manager (who skeeved me OUT) came up to tell us that they had \"accidentally\" double booked the room and we were being bumped to a table in the regular dining room. My friend was NOT pleased but we rolled with it.   I then Yelped the place, and discovered multiple other reviews of people being 'double booked' out of the pope room. I think they are intentionally doing this bait-and-switch 'double booking' thing, because by the time you get there and they tell you the mistake, no way are you going to take your entire party of 10+ people and try to find another restaurant at 6pm on a Friday. They can smash as many large parties in as possible that way. Clever, clever.  2) We tried to cash out, and the bartender had disappeared. When he returned, his face was bright red and he was sniffling. Boyfriend and I exchanged one look and simultaneously muttered \"Cokehead\". This was confirmed when he ran our card for $147 instead of just our 2 drinks. He reversed it, but the charge still went through to the bank.... because we got hit with multiple overdraft fees today, as we had used the card for several other transactions that night. Now we have to argue with Wells Fargo about this. I know, people make mistakes, yada yada, but had this guy not just obviously done a line in the back, he likely would not have made that mistake.",

    "text": "Its been maybe 7+ years since I last visited and I always remembered this as a distinctly average place with a cutesy decor.   However the food here was so bad tonight (Christmas eve) that is unlikely that I will ever return again. I've had better Italian food at an Olive Garden.   The \"mouse trap\" which brought the family into this mediocre establishment after all these years was a Bucca $50 gift card given to me by a business associate.   After reviewing the menu it struck that prices here seemed sky high - even considering the family style platters. Most pasta dishes averaged $20 for a small plate and $30+ for a large. The selections are all the typical Ameri-Italian fare you might expect - chicken parm, spaghetti and meatballs, Marsala, etc   When we were seated we did the obligatory walk through the working kitchen to the dining room - gee what a clever novelty.   The fact is that if your seeking this type of food experience, the Maggianos chain is far (far) superior to the lousy food being heaped at customers at this crummy restaurant.   We ordered the the Mozzarella Caprese to start - pretty simple. When the dish arrived we all noticed that the sliced tomatoes all looked rather unripe. These looked AND tasted like the cheap tomatoes you might get on a $2.00 burger at McDonalds - certainly not at a moderately priced sit down restaurant where your average bill for 4 is probably $100 or more. Needless to say the Caprese was a big letdown - low grade olive oil drizzled over pink tomatoes with generous sprinkles of salt & pepper.   We also ordered the $8 garlic bread basket -another  massive dud appetizer which tasted like the bland & doughy \"assembly line\" French loaves you might get at a Safeway market in a foil bag. Little garlic to be found, stale tasting bread - no one liked it.   Yelpers let me ask you - even with the supposedly kitschy decor if the food is no good than what is the point? This whole Bucca concept is so cliche with the endless looping Frank Sinatra/ Dean Martin music and goofy photos throughout.   Why is this place so busy? Mystery! Oy vey this place is like Outback Steakhouse but with Italian food - a genuine mystery, especially with so many wonderful and moderately priced restaurants nearby. What is the draw here?   Our waiter was Paolo (who was trying mightily to come off debonair) took our orders and his service was adequate. We ordered the chicken parm and a penne with vodka sauce.  When the plates arrived we all found that the chicken was over-breaded (the breading was literally dripping off the sides of the chicken) with a deep fried taste & consistency, way too much gooey cheese and very little sauce. Just plain yuck.   The penne was just too spicy and too creamy for a rosa sauce - again just meh.   Total damages with one beer was about $90 including the gratuity.    What a joke right? No one liked the food and it pretty much ruined our evening. We all talked about the bad experience here for hours after leaving - that is the kind of impression it left.  Even with our $50 gift certificate we all felt like we were taken to the cleaners with the awful food here.   Why spend big $ here for so-so food when there are a plethora of great places nearby that actually care about serving quality food?   Note to self - avoid this place at all costs.",

I chose this place for a special day since it was on OpenTable and I was looking for reservations which was nice and convenient on a \"holiday\". However, after Mother's Day I'm never coming here again.   First off everything is family size now so you cannot order a meal for yourself. You must share with someone else or with many other people. Horrible business model but I'm sure they love it since for just four people it cost over $80 bucks. What a ripoff for an app, chicken and a bowl of pasta. A tiny tray of calamari was $14 and it wasn't as good as other places. Also they had ran out of basil which was a bummer.  Next, the service was severely lacking. our server was extremely inattentive, would ignore requests when we tried to get his attention. He would look at us, wave and go in the other direction. He constantly forgot to bring us drink/water refills, food/bread/sides, seasoning, etc.. after we had kindly asked. We had empty glasses for over 15 minutes.   The worst part though was when the kitchen undercooked the chicken limone. By the time they recooked it, I had already finished my meal and my mom had lost her appetite. Great way to ruin mother's day dinner! there are dozens of better places in old town and Scottsdale in general. Going to avoid this place from now on.",

We waited for another 20 minutes to get our salad. Another 15 to have our bread brought out and another 30 to have half of our food brought out (warm, not hot), because Colin our waiter informed us that it takes 25 minutes to have their bolognese dish prepared since it is made from scratch. I take it he didn't even bother putting our order in after he took it.   Mind you, we had already ordered ONE HOUR and FIVE minutes previously. What a disappointment.

The Good:  1- I made a reservation on open table and we got in 15 minutes early yet we got seated right away. 2- Were greeted by a hostess and she was very welcoming 3- The food as always is good 4- Our server Paulo was good as he was doing EVERYTHING, literally, everything and see the BAD section for more details.  The Bad:  1- Service was VERY SLOW, and that is not because Paulo, it is because Paulo was doing EVERYTHING. From clearing tables, then cleaning them, getting the food out, checking on everyone to make sure they have everything.  2- Service was very slow 3- Service was very slow   The management at this restaurant seems that they did not care yesterday. As there were no buss staff, clearing  tables or food runners to get t he food out. They did not care to at least pick up the pace and come over an ask at least how things were, knowing that the section the server was serving at is short staffed. I felt so bad for the server, that i really wanted to get up and do something.   A party of 5 or 6 showed up after us an the hostess brought them to the same section we were seated, and Paulo the server was making sure we were taken care of but at the same time he asked that group to wait for a few minutes while he cleaned the table they were being seated at. The Hostess did not even bother to help clear the table. Overall it was bad and we have been to too many different Buca locations and this is the first time i see such a mess.   So Paulo gets 5 stars, the restaurant however gets 3 or less.",

We asked to walk around to check the place out, the staff was so welcoming and extremely nice... traveling through the kitchen was a cool experience in itself, the only reason we were disappointed was because we did not dine-in along the positive atmosphere. We came home, watched game of thrones, and enjoyed the food immensely, next time we will stay to eat and have the full Italian experience.",

    "text": "It's Olive Garden with a personality. Buca di Beppo, though a chain, has more than a few things going for it.   The Scottsdale location can easily accommodate large groups. Family style servings contribute to great interaction with friends and family. The decor is gaudy and creative, with an emphasis on Italian heritage and a touch of humor here and there. Gene Simmons on the celebrity wall? Generally friendly staff. Kid friendly (triangular crayons!). And the food is decent.  Any negatives? The entrees, while solid, don't have the impact of a True fine Italian restaurant. On this visit we ordered the Apple Gorgonzola Salad. It was enjoyed by all. The Chicken Cannelloni and the Chicken Marsala were great. The Baked Ziti, however, was dry and far from flavorful. Three out of four isn't bad I suppose. And a single mistake is less catastrophic since everything is being shared family style anyway.  We had two children in our group and felt pressured to pop for the $4.99 kid's Cioccolata and Pisa Punch served in glasses with flashing lights in their base. The lids were poorly designed, subject to spillage around the straw, but the kids did enjoy the beverages. $10 of enjoyment? Well. At least refills were free.   Ordering the right amount of food from the family style menu can be tricky. The portions are generous, so it's easy to order too much. For example, our server's recommendation to share a small salad for four adults was perfect, even though the written menu would have suggested the larger size. I'd recommend getting some friends together and ordering several small entrees for variety,  I'd also recommend just letting kids share the adult family style entrees rather than ordering from the children's menu (unless they just have to have macaroni and cheese). The four and five year olds in our party were fine with it and it helped them feel fully part of the group. They weren't quite as supportive, however, when we refused to order the giant brownie sundae. I was willing, but...",

We also got a small Ziti with Chicken, but we didn't like the sauce and there was barely any chicken.  The Service: Good. No complaints, we got a younger girl who was very polite and friendly. She stayed on top of our drinks and overall did a great job.  The Decor: Older run down inside. The outside looks fine, but the booths, carpet, and antiques were all outdated and looked like they needed some love. They did walk us through the kitchen on the way to our seats and that was probably the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen.  The Desserts: I got a lemon raspberry cake that was really good. I saw someone else get a HUGE brownie sundae goblet they said would feed 6 or something crazy. It looked intense.",

    "text": "Horrible, horrible experience. Aaron, our waiter has no business working in the industry. He lacked any and all empathy for our food that took over TWO HOURS to be brought out. Every single table around us got their food first even though we had been seated long before them. He continued to fill up my pink lemonade cup with water and acted put out when I'd ask for another lemonade.  The manager on duty comped our entire meal. It still then took another hour for our food to be brought out. When Aaron dropped the bag at the table he stood there, clearly expecting a \"thank you\" and when he did not receive one as we simply stood up to leave, he threw his hands up and said, \"yeah. Thank you\".  We will never be returning to this location again. We very much appreciate the manager handling it, however there was zero follow up after he spoke to us and every time he walked by he avoided eye contact at all costs. Considering we were there an hour after he spoke with us, a follow up would have been nice.",

Interestingly, they start you off for a walk through the kitchen. There's even a booth in the kitchen (by reservation for you foodies out there!) if you want to watch them cook.   My husband is Italian, and he enjoyed the meal, so it must be good. We had an appetizer platter with mozzarella sticks, calamari and stuffed mushrooms, and a special gnocchi with pancetta (I'm pescatarian so I had to pick around a bit). The food is delicious and served family style. We had enough food for lunch the next day!",

Food is expensive, and coming from the N.E part of the country with a great Italian food scene: this food is crap.  -generous portions of cold bread and cold food  -brought my pizza out 25 min before my other parties food. Literally 25 min. (1) dish out of a party of 7. -bartender screwed up a light margarita for a reg. one. Seemingly no big unless you are a diabetic, which someone in our party was. The server (who was great) and the manager were very apologetic and concerned.   I doubt this location will be here in 10 years. I'm sad to relay this: Olive Garden is better. Ouch, that really hurt to type.  If your in Scottsdale just follow the other Yelp reviews to a better Italian restaurant.",

Even though I live within walking distance, today was the first time I've given it a shot because I was in the mood for some Italian food and it was the only place open at 11. All three dishes my family ordered were average, not horrible, but not exceptional in any way. The one nice attribute that this location has is the patio that looks over Scottsdale road. I can't really recommend it for anyone looking for Italian in old town.",
