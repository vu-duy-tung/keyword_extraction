I brought my kids and they even make them special quesadillas.   I am a huge fan of Lengua Tacos and theirs are the best I've ever had. The crunchy tacos are also soooooo good. Our server walked us through the menu and helped us pick the perfect amount of food. She was friendly and even the manager/owner came by our table and made us feel so welcome.   Hoping to go back soon!",

This place was right around the corner from where we were staying, and we can never pass up tacos! I got their house margarita, which was $7, not too sweet, and refreshing! They had a great selection of tequila, bourbon, and whiskey from what I could see, as well as a nice rotating craft beer tap. The street tacos were really good, but pretty small, so be aware. Their crunchy tacos were bigger, and around the same size, so I recommend getting a mix of the two.   Never thought I would be saying this about a bar, but I really like the padded section around the bar. I don't think I've seen this anywhere else, but it made sitting at the bar really comfy! Bartender was very friendly and attentive, the space is cozy but hip, and we will probably be back!

The ahi is the only one I've had that leaves a little to be desired. On that note, their queso is decent but nothing to write home about, but the guac is pretty fantastic.  They have a pretty solid happy hour, and keep their kitchen open until 11 during the week and midnight on the weekends, I believe.  It's a small spot but service is usually on point, both table side and at the bar.",

I had the Crujiente pork taco, pork belly and korean fried chicken tacos. I liked them in that order. The korean fried chicken had too strong of the red sauce flavor for me (the gochujang sauce I think). I tried some of the lamb taco and that was pretty good.   The different salsas were also really good and there was one that was especially spicy but flavorful.   Recommended for some nontraditional tacos.",

Drinks - Met Nate the bartender. Upbeat and fun guy with great stories. Makes a killer margarita. Top Notch bartender. Happy hour does seem to run later on in the night as well.   Seating - on the smaller side, would recommend getting their early to beat the dinner rush. The bar has the best seats in the house in my opinion.   Will be returning. Best times I've found to come in are Wednesday evenings and Friday's after 6.",

Savory grilled street corn is an absolute must and don't be misled by this place being stuffed in a strip center-the moment you walk in you will smile and your tastebuds will be happy!",

The tacos menu is different from pretty much everything else in the valley. Good quality too. You'd think in Phoenix of all places it wouldn't be that hard to get a good taco, but it really is.",

Duck, grouper and pork.  All three of them were very good and flavorful.  After my meal arrived I was noticing that they had a taco of the week.

If you go next door to Sushiholics, you get a full order of Octopus for $7 and a full order of shishito peppers for $5. This place is beautiful inside and the food is good, but not worth the price. I get that it's tapas, but you don't need to gouge people. You're not The Sanctuary, you're in a strip mall.....next to a shoe repair shop.",

I have had it on my yelp bookmarks for a while now because tacos with a twist are my favorite. Don't get me wrong, I love traditional street tacos too but their menu is so creative and sounded amazing!  As you walk in, the vibe is awesome with the lights dim and the front window open to the fresh air. The music is loud but not too loud. Just perfect for a Saturday night. The waiter was also very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  We tried the Korean fried tacos, the lamb CRUjiente taco and the fish tacos. Everything was fresh and beautiful when delivered but way over seasoned with salt. The grouper for the tacos was very fresh and had a perfect texture but I couldn't get past the first bite because it was very salty. The lamb was also very salty. The Korean bbq had the perfect amount of heat and the chicken was fried perfectly but the batter was really salty again. Maybe we hit it on a night where the chef just had a heavy hand on the salt, but we left feeling very underwhelmed. I do hope to come back and maybe try a few other tacos when the \"salt bae\" isn't in the kitchen overdoing it.",

Their pork belly taco won the \"Best of the Valley\" award by Phoenix Magazine. As a thank you, customers received a free pork belly taco with any purchase off the menu.  Sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the owner and friendly wait staff. It was happy hour so lots of great deals to be had, but I had an idea of what I wanted.  The bartender, Morgan thoroughly explained their menu and offered great recommendations. I decided on the Korean fried chicken taco, the duck taco, the beef hard shell and obviously the pork belly.  The tacos arrived quickly and wow, the presentation was special! Morgan advised me on the order to eat the tacos based on flavor and boy were they flavorful! Every bite was pleasing. There is a reason why the pork belly taco won Best of the Valley and it was clearly my favorite. I finished my meal feeling satisfied but not uncomfortably full.  Also took advantage of the 50% off dessert check-in offer and it was well worth it.   This is one of those places that you need to visit and will want to come back for more. I will return soon to try all the other tacos.  Do yourself a favor and come here ASAP!",

This wasn't enough to outweigh the bad though. The food is way overpriced, $9 for chips and guac? And the tacos are miniature. For $16 (three tacos) I wasn't remotely full; my husband was shocked at how small they were. The men in the group all thought the beers were way overpriced. The icing on the cake is that I brought a Costco cake in for the birthday girl, it cost $16, and they charged us $19.50 in cake cutting fees. This isn't a fancy restaurant, not to mention we were one of two tables in the place when it came time for cake. One would think for a party of 13 (all who had never been in), on a Wednesday, in a new restaurant, you might let it slide.",

Their margies are better than the Missions, and they have unique and interesting combinations and that goes as well for their tacos.  Our waitress was helpful, friendly and also spent time talking to us about the food. After we finished dinner, chef, Rich Hinojosa came over and asked how we enjoyed the food.  This place really cares about your experience.  He spent 20 minutes at our table taking about his recipes, his past work experiences and what they plan for the future.

That being said this place is more of a time to really experience more than your average taco and is well worth it. With each taco(tasting a total of 6 different tacos) you can tell the effort that was put behind crafting it with how well the proteins blend with the sauces and garnishes. The set up of everything was extraordinary and service was fulfilled with any questions we had and she checked on us thoroughly (thank you Lauren) overall my favorites were the Korean fried chicken taco that tastes like it came straight from a sushi chef and the 36 hour short rib taco, although extremely spicy so be warned. Overall an amazing experience that you don't do every night but will definitely recommend people for the atmosphere and food.",

The guacamole was exceptional! I had a ceaser salad that was dressed perfectly! Now , the posole, for New Years my mother has guests for two days that show just to have her posole. I told the table that I felt guilty for enjoying the posole at CRUjiente as much as I did, it was outstanding, (sorry mom). The dessert was plated so meticulously it was almost too to beautuful to eat, almost! Only one option for dessert but that was all we needed. The bunuelos were not too thin and we're perfectly crunchy plated with a chocolate mouse and strawberry pico that was the perfect end to a perfect meal. We did not have drinks from the bar however, I will note that one of our dinner guests mentioned how impressive the bourbon and whisky options were.",

The place has a sleek, modern decor and an upscale vibe. My husband ordered the Grand Cru margarita and I had the Strawberry Basil margarita.  Because of National Margarita Day, both drinks were $5, normally they go for $10 and $9 respectively. The drinks were different than any margarita we've ever had, but both were excellent. We also ordered the chips and salsa trio, the chips were served in a brown paper bag and tasted like they had been freshly made - delicious!  We opted for a few different types of tacos, I ordered off the Tacos de la Calle (street taco) menu and had the Pork Belly Taco and the Korean Fried Chicken Taco. My husband also had the Korean Fried Chicken Taco along with the Tempura Avocado Taco as well as the Beef Taco off the Tacos Crujientes (crunchy tacos) menu. Far and away my favorite was the Korean Fried Chicken, loved that combination of Asian spices in a street taco format.  My husband's favorite was the crunchy Beef Taco, the beef was perfectly seasoned and extremely tasty.  We'll definitely be visiting this restaurant whenever we're in the neighborhood.",

In a town overrun with mediocre tacos, I like the modern twist and quality of these tacos. The CRUjiente pork taco was juicy and had the perfect amount of kick. I also enjoyed the melt in your mouth wagyu beef street taco served on a blue corn tortilla with a creamy horseradish sauce. My friend raved about the Korean fried chicken street taco.   We were there around 7:45 on a Friday night and I used the Yelp waitlist app and we were seated right away. The place was packed and the server was still very friendly and attentive. She even brought a cute little deep fried carrot cake with goat cheese cream and candied walnut taco as my birthday dessert.   The owner even stopped by to chat and wished me a happy birthday, a nice personal touch!  Our only issue was being seated by a table of 10'ish that was so obnoxiously loud we couldn't hear ourselves talk at times. Note to self, sit towards the front of the restaurant, it's quieter.  I can't wait to come back to try something else on the menu!",

When we drove up, it was dark and we thought it was closed, but it was open!  We came here right at the start of reverse happy hour at 9pm so we were pretty stoked to get a deal.  I ordered the mezcal margarita, the pork belly taco (soft taco) and the lamb crujiente taco (crunchy taco).   The mezcal on the margarita was light, so I barely got a hint of it unfortunately. It was not on happy hour so I should have ordered one on happy hour instead.   Personally, I'm not a fan of crunchy tacos and I wished I had ordered another soft taco instead. The taco was tasty and the lamb was moist but I was disappointed.   I really enjoyed my pork belly taco. The meat the flavorful and balanced out well with the tortilla.

This baby has the right hint of tequila mixed with orange and lime.  -Guacamole and chips: not just mashed avocados! The flavor hits with every bite.  -Green Chile chicken taco: the best chicken tacos I've had at a restaurant ever. No lie.  -Grilled summer squash taco: a vegetarian's dream. I could fill up on just these alone.  Also had a taco of the week that was incredibly flavorful, I just don't remember which one . Worth the ask though!!  An appetizer and three tacos was more than enough to fill us up. We will definitely be back to try the grilled street corn and more of the specialty drinks!!

The chips and salsa were really good and a good combination of mild to spicy.   For the tacos, I went with one crunchy beef, the short rib, and the fried chicken. I really ended up getting the crunchy just because it was in the name but I liked it and I really like the spicy sauce on top. The short rib was really good and the meat was flavorful. In the end, the Korean fried chicken was for sure my favorite! It won best taco and the taco fest in 2017 and it's clear to see why! From the mixture of sauces, bell peppers, to the perfectly crispy fried chicken, this is one of my all time favorite tacos.   I cant wait to go back...

    "text": "My husband and I had a very disappointing experience this past Saturday.  It was a busy Saturday night and the restaurant was full and we were just trying to get a drink at the bar.  Both bartenders were busy so my husband asked an employee, (who ended up being the owner), if he could order some drinks.  The owner proceeded to tell him \"well, you can try\".  Come on...as a manager/owner of a restaurant, you should never tell a customer \"well, you can try\".  Your immediate reaction should be, yes of course, what can I get you.  He then proceeded to tell my husband we could try and get the bartenders attention or if a server came by, they could take our order.  Fortunately, an amazing server overheard and took our order and had to apologize on behalf of the owner for his response.  My husband did call the owner out on his comment and his response was \"well, we made it happen\"...which again, not ok.  The server made it happen-he had absolutely nothing to do with it.  I grew up in the restaurant business-my parents owned/managed restaurants for 30 years!  A restaurant should never make a customer feel as though they're not important enough just because it's busy.  I would think that a restaurant would want to make money, not refuse it.  We left shortly after as he was so incredibly rude.  I get it-you have good days and bad days, but your job is customer service and there was no such thing given to us by the owner but we are so grateful to the kind server.  To the owner-you should take some cues from her on how to treat customers.  We won't ever return to this restaurant.",

This isn't the place for that, if you're looking for more of a tapas experience then it's great. CRUjiente's specialty tacos are fantastic, I've tried many different ones and the standouts are their Wagyu and Korean Fried chicken. I find that their traditional tacos are pretty basic and not a good value, but if you stick with their specialty tacos you will be much more satisfied. Their guacamole is delicious too and comes with an ample amount of chips which are served in a paper bag to stay warm. I also really enjoy their margaritas which have fresh ingredients, no fake stuff. They also have a great beer selection on tap.",

    "text": "After briefly scanning their pictures and skimming the menu, I was a bit skeptical about visiting CRUjiente Tacos. In fact, in many of my reviews, I often make jokes about the whole naivety of people that blindly pay 4-5 dollars for street tacos that are no better than what you can obtain from a reputable taco truck.  But going into CRU, one must realize, this isn't really traditional Mexican tacos - nor are they trying to be. The focus is on chef-driven creations. Some unique, some traditional, but all consistently executed to the highest level possible. And over the course of the last year, my girlfriend and I have become very big fans of what they're doing here.  Taco recommendations are tricky, because while I've not necessarily loved every taco that I've tried here, poor quality is never the culprit. Virtually everything is made well, it's just a matter of personal preference. My favorite is the pork belly, while the 36-hour short rib and Korean fried chicken are ones that I feel everyone should try at least once. All tacos seem to thrive on their simplicity, using just the right amount of ingredients to create balance, where nothing is too overpowering.  They offer a single dessert (bunuelos). It's fine, although I wish they had more options, as I have a feeling the chef could really do some amazing things on the dessert end if they chose to do so. Hell, even their more traditional offerings like guacamole and cheese quesadillas have become staples during our visits. More importantly, the quality is always consistent, which is more uncommon than one would assume in the Phoenix dining scene.  Parking is a total pain, which isn't necessarily their fault. Unfortunately, there are many instances where there is absolutely no parking available in the entire plaza whatsoever, forcing you to either fight for spaces or park across the street and jaywalk across Camelback.    Despite my praises, I will maintain that the tacos aren't really for everyone. If you eat a lot (and drink even more), you'll rack up a massive bill pretty quickly. These ain't cheap. With this warning aside, I really enjoy the process of experimentation with chef-driven creations - which is what this place is all about. Sometimes, just being given a handful of bare-bones tacos to cover at the free-for-all salsa bar gets boring. It's nice to have a great alternative like this available. As a result, it has quickly become a favorite of ours during the last year. And the more I go here, the more I like them.  Highest recommendation!",

They have an extensively tequila list but I usually stick with the house margarita, which is $5 on happy hour! The beef CRUjiente taco is my favorite! In fact last time I was here, I had to order two! The guac, salsas, and chips are delicious, but I wish the chips were not served in a greasy paper bag. It's not classy and it doesn't fit in the atmosphere of the restaurant. The prices can be a little high for the portion sizes of their tacos, but they do a lot of deals. For example, Wednesday is all night happy hour!",

The fish taco was probably the best out of what we ordered but that's personal preference.  The cost didn't match the flavor overall.  Recommend for margaritas but wouldn't recommend for food.  Would possibly go back for the ceviche.  Restaurant was very clean and ambience and service were what boosted my rating to 4 stars but based on flavor only, it's a 3.",

    "text": "Brand new taco joint in Arcadia, and it is definitely worth checking out!    Let's start with the food/drinks: we sampled the ceviche appetizer, and 3 different tacos.  Every dish was super tasty!  The ceviche was nice and light and came with warm chips, and the tacos (blue crab, korean friend chicken, and 36 hour short rib) were all sensational!!  If you are willing to try something a little different, please please PLEASE try the korean friend chicken: the chili paste on this taco is out of this world good.  For the drinks, the 4 that we sampled were all delicious (2 different margaritas, and a fresh watermelon/vodka cocktail) however they were a bit light-handed on the spirits.  Just a splash more of alcohol would put them over the edge into special-land ;)  I was also super please with the interior decor.  This place used to be the burger joint The Grind, and the interior updates still have cool vibe The Grind had, but with a Mexican street, open feel.  They also opened up the wall to be one giant window, so the beautiful Arizona breeze made it's way through the whole restaurant.  And one more thing: the service we had was awesome!  Our server was very attentive and gave us great food and drink recommendations, and the owner, Jason, was incredibly friendly and informative.  After chatting with us a bit about the concept, chef collaboration, and finding the perfect place to open, he sent us a dessert that was smack-you-in-the-face tasty! I don't remember what it was called, but it was a Mexican chocolate moose with fresh strawberries.  Totally unique, light and delicious.  If you're in the mood for tacos, definitely come and check out this new neighborhood joint!",

Not a huge fan of the fried chicken - Korean sauce tasted extremely chalky. additionally, the portion of horseradish on the steak was out of control. Wife absolutely hated the shrimp taco.  Additionally got a whiskey cocktail, wife got a marg. Drinks were not bad, nothing spectacular.  Honestly, I don't even know why I'm rating this a 4. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great - I probably wouldn't go again. But I feel like 3 stars isn't appropriate.  TTW has exponentially better tacos and drinks. Will stick to that.",

We arrived around 8 and was seated at 815.  It was somewhat full, but no wait by the time we were seated. I fell for the tiny lobster street taco with two pieces of lobster for $15.50, because the waitress said it was amazing! It was not! The flavor was OK, but the lobster was extremely chewy and definitely not worth $15.50.  We ordered the octopus appetizer, not bad, not good, nothing exciting. The octopus arrived pretty quickly and then it was 45 minutes before our tacos arrived. No one stopped by the table to see how we were doing. The manager with the iPad walked by our table at least six or seven times talking to customers he knew, and never once mentioned that we had no food on the table for 45 minutes. After the food arrived, the waitress stopped by to see how things were. I couldn't help myself, so I said does the food usually take this long and she went on with some explanation about getting behind because they had large parties. I get it... Stop by the table of the people sitting there with no food for 45 minutes and say something! Sometimes it actually is about customer service! It was our first time, and we won't be back, because the experience was so bad!  I hope this review at least catches the attention of the owner, so they can work a little on Customer service... It does go along way!",

I truly hope crujiente reads this and gives her some tacos and one of their strongly poured margaritas on the house! Check their nightly features as Monday's and Wednesday's they have killer deals and make it one of the the best dollar for dollar margaritas and food deals around. However despite these deals their food quality remains a cut above your average taco restaurant while entertaining fun and delicious options such as wagyu beef taco with horseradish and a Korean fried chicken option. I recommend you stop in here and experience a nice mix of ambiance, food, service, and quality libations at this Arcadia taco standout.",

When we first walked in we just stood there awkwardly until the bartender noticed and called a waitress over to seat us. The drinks are reasonably priced, I got a margarita for $8. There are lots of tacos to choose from. I went with fish tacos and my husband got fried chicken, pork, and the special of the week, oyster tacos. Man these tacos are small. Our waitress said they are legit Mexican street taco size and I haven't ordered any street tacos from Mexico before, but I have ordered from legit Mexican restaurants in the valley and never seen such a small taco. And most tacos are $5 each and if you're hungry you'll want 3-4 so this is not a cheap taco meal. Anyways the size isn't that important, the tacos were just okay. I enjoyed my fish taco, but I've had better. It didn't have a lot of flavor or spices. You can tell all the tacos are very freshly made and high quality but if the flavors isn't there, that doesn't matter. My husband was not impressed with any of his 3 tacos. His favorite was the crunchy pork, he said the other two were just overly spicy. Not a good place for a date night because it was loud and all of the tables are high tops.",

Grabbed a seat a the bar and started out with a bourbon - excellent selection and prices.  They have a diverse taco selection and I opted for the Korean fried chicken taco, duck taco with mole, and the weekly special which was the green chicken chile taco.  Also got some grilled corn.  The best taco was the green chili one.  Grilled corn was good but a little spicy.  I thought the portions/price were reasonable given the quality of taco you were getting.  Food was $20 but if you  look at just the tacos it was $13.  Will be back soon!",

It has been on my bookmark list for a while now and it is in the neighborhood so I really don't have a good excuse as to why it took me so long to come!   On Tuesdays, their happy hour taco prices go all day which is great! I do think that their tacos are a little pricey for the size normally, but they are unique and delicious regardless. Therefore, Taco Tuesday is a great time to come.  We ordered the guac, salsa, and chips to start and they were all so tasty. Chips and salsa are not complimentary here but that is ok! If you're a salsa addict like me, you'll get them regardless. And their regular salsa was fresh and flavorful!   For tacos, I ordered their CRUjiente beef which is in a crispy shell and definitely bigger than their normal tacos. The shredded beef was delicious!  Next, I ordered their shrimp taco which has a curry sauce and pickled vegetables on it. SO different but I really liked it! It came with one large shrimp, not multiple small shrimps which i've never had before. Way to stay unique!   For my third taco, I got the crispy Korean chicken taco and THIS WAS MY FAVORITE. Yup, I saved the best for last. If you come here, you must get it. It is a flavor explosion in your mouth!   All in all, I would definitely come back here for happy hour! They have great drink specials and the food is decently priced at happy hour too. I just think it is a tad on the pricey side for tacos if you were to just come normally.",

    "text": "We had a subpar experience here yesterday. We went do happy hour which is every day 3-6. Sounded really great! When we got there, not one person acknowledged us. There was no hostess. There were plenty of waitresses buzzing around, and two bartenders. One of which just kept looking at us, but never said hello or offered  directions on what we should be doing.   Finally we just walked to a big long table in the back, and as soon as we were going to sit down a waitress tells us that it is reserved for a party later. I ask her where we should sit, she said we can go put our names in the iPad up front or sit at the bar. So we sit at the bar to wait for a table.   Bartender does come over, but is not friendly at all. We order a margarita (which is by far the best thing about dining here). And order some tacos. We came here because the menu says they use \"organic non-gmo blue corn tortillas\". So we order up since I'm gluten free.  While we wait for the tacos, a few tables open up and are immediately snatched by people hovering. We still get no text that a table is ready. When our tacos come out, one is on blue corn and the other is on a white tortilla. I ask the bartender and he said it's a flour tortilla. Wouldn't you take the time to say this taco comes on a flour tortilla instead of our usual corn tortilla, since he did explain about the blue corn tortilla when we were ordering?  The tacos were okay. Some were better than the others. But the lack of service and mediocre atmosphere, is enough to have us pass on this next time. Also, we got a text when we were leaving that our table was ready.   Pass if you like to dine somewhere with friendly attentive service.",

    "text": "Some of the best tacos I've had outside the great state of Texas. They are small, but delicious! Their green chile chicken taco is to die for - so so flavorful with the seasoned chicken and onions. I LOVED their tempura avocado taco as well - very smooth - and it countered the spice in the green chile taco well.   Their tortillas are house made!!!! That's also hard to come by. We got their chips with guacamole and house salsa. The chips were fresh, thin, and salted to perfection. The guacamole had a kick to it for sure and so did the house salsa. All excellent.   They have some great cocktails, all of which they will happily make non-alcoholic if you ask. I tried a drink that was called \" ___\" Kid (sorry! Forgot what it was called and its not on the online menu) and it was FANTASTIC!   If you cant handle spicy food, let your waiter or waitress know. This place does not tone anything down for you at baseline, if you don't ask - it is 100% authentic.   The service was amazing as well! We loved our waitress who was knowledgeable, kind, and forthcoming with recommendations on what to do in the area!   It is located in a random block with a few other shops, away from the busier areas of Phoenix. It was not crowded when we went on a Saturday evening and we didn't need a reservation! So if you don't have the time for a long wait for delicious tacos, this is the place to go!",

    "text": "I went to CRUjiente tacos by myself on a Thursday night because I didn't want to wait for a friend to go with me to try it. I'm a vegetarian and was excited to see that they had two savory taco options for vegetarians. Here is the breakdown of what I ordered: -Garlic Roasted Mushroom Tacos: This taco had a really delicious savory umami flavor. I've never had this type of a taco before so it was interesting to try. -Tempura Avocado Taco: Also really delicious, but more straightforward taco. I'm glad they have this as a second option for vegetarians to help keep it a bit more interesting. But if I'm being totally honest, I feel like I've had this taco before. -Arcadia Margarita: My favorite item of the night. Their margaritas are so fresh tasting and definitely worth a try. I will need to come back for happy hour to drink more margaritas! Their margaritas are definitely some of the best in the valley.  Service was pleasant, but nothing over the top. I do like the general upscale yet trendy casual vibe of the restaurant. I would definitely keep in mind that if you plan to eat here for a meal, you would probably need 3-6 tacos depending on how much you eat. And at $5-8 per taco, you will be spending anywhere from $20-60 just for food+tax+tip for one person. So if you aren't prepared to spend that much, I would recommend going for happy hour and making the tacos more of a snack. Also side note that Yelp says \"Latin American\" as the type of cuisine, but I would definitely say that it's more \"New American + tapas\" in case that matters to anybody.",

Here the play by play: Drinks - expensive enough that we didn't get any Queso Fundido - like most of the meal, they went for something outside the traditional. The flavor was decent, with an unusual earthy taste. Unfortunately, the consistency was a bit too oily (and the oil felt a little old) Pork taco - by far the best food item we had. The shell was awesome, and the pork was very well marinated and moist. Everything here was on point.  Lengua Taco - dry, bland meat. I'm usually a lengua lover, but this one did nothing for me. Lamb - The super-sweet Birria sauce overpowered everything else. The flavor would have been pretty good, if they just laid off the sugar a bit. I love mole and don't mind sweet with my meat, but this was too much. Service- attentive, but oddly cold. Atmosphere- dark and swanky  Overall, we likely won't come back. With so many great taco places at pretty much every price point. This one just didn't stick out",

He told us all about the menu, was attentive, knowledgeable, great personality and very friendly! I'd sacrifice an average meal for great service alone... However, the food was much greater than average. We ordered quite a few tacos, ceviche, gauc, salsa- it was all so fresh and flavor was amazing.

One thing I definitely hope they change is the fact that they don't do take out. I called to find out if they do and I was told no.. That's a bummer..",

    "text": "So disappointed!!  After hearing for weeks that this place was opening we were looking forward to trying it.  The service was horrible. I really don't know how else to describe it.   We ordered chips & salsa as an appetizer.  It never came.  We had to ask for it after our dinner was served.  Not one person came to ask how our dinner was. We never even had silverware!  Fortunately we were eating tacos but I still would have preferred a fork or knife.  The worst part is the bill. For $50, 5 small street tacos and chips & salsa, way way overpriced.  Yet and still if the service was better we could have lived with it.  Edit in response to Jason's comment below: Breakdown of bill looked like this: 3 hard tacos - $18 2 small tacos - $10 total  Chips & salsa - $5......btw, never went to Mexican restaurant and had to pay for chips 1 cocktail - $10 1 ice tea  Total: $47.63 Tip: $6.50 Total bill: $54.13",

From the moment you walk in, you get a sense of a relaxed vibe with the perfect ambiance for a nice dinner with friends. Several booths and large high top tables are great for enjoying the company of friends or family. Now let's get to the important part, the food!! There were so many mouth watering options I couldn't even decide. The owner was very helpful and was very passionate. I could tell he loved his job as hr was describing the flavor notes of each street taco.These street tacos are not messing around. No take out orders to keep the QUALITY of their food fresh. I finally decided on the Waygu and Korean bbq and I am still dreaming about them! My friend ordered Waygu and a shrimp as well as a fish taco and all were delicious. You really can't go wrong but the flavors and the melt in your mouth beef had me craving more and more! And the best part? The prices! For the quality as well as fresh ingredients and homemade salsas it was very affordable. This amazing restaurant needs to be HYPED UP! It is in an unassuming little shop area! You won't be disappointed and the atmosphere and taste of the food is excellent. I have been raving about this establishment ever since and I am so glad I was recommended to go here. OH and I almost forgot, their Queso! It is Tex Mex style with influences from San Antonio and it was to die for! Also, the chips were hot and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. Every aspect of my experience was phenomenal.",

We got there early, ordered the premier cru margarita, a beer and guacamole and fell in love! Between the six of us we had the Korean fried chicken taco, beef short rib taco, lamb taco, oyster taco, duck taco, pork belly taco, street corn, pozole and gazpacho. We had the margaritas, Spanish red wine and beers.  I am Mexican and like rice and beans with my Mexican food.  Last night I did not miss them.  The food is all perfectly seasoned, a bit hot for one in our group, but otherwise just perfect. Service was excellent from the moment we walked in till we walked out. Chef Hinojosa has created my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  And not just because we are both from Texas where he obviously got his very fine early training.  What a wonderful addition to our Latino restaurants.",

The blue crab tacos kind of reminded me of a fish stick. The fish taco was really good too. We also got their chips & guac. The chips came in a brown paper bag and were nice and hot (temperature-wise). Note that they are closed on Sundays.",

It was tempura fried chicken that was extra crispy.... oh my I'll have another one or two.   Drinks: the drinks were excellent.  The bartender really takes the time to make you a perfect drink.  There are not frozen from a machine she muttells all of the fresh herbs that go into every drink, so a mojito takes like a refreshing mojito!   Is it worth a return visit: most definitely.

I am super picky when it comes to tacos and Mexican food in general and this was the best I have had in a very long time. The taco special of the day was crab, which I ordered in addition to the shrimp taco. They were street taco sized but packed a ton of flavor. My husband ordered a pork belly (YES!!!), Korean fried chicken (super tasty), and green chill chicken (YUM!) tacos and loved them all.   Our table ordered the guacamole and trio salsa appetizers, both we loved. The queso was good but nothing exceptional, our friends let us know that it is generally better than it was that night. We also ordered the grilled corn, which I could easily eat my weight in, yum!   We tried a number of specialty cocktails, each more delicious from the last. I look forward to coming back on Wednesdays for all day happy to score deals on the tacos, apps, and cocktails. It is like Taco Tuesday, but even better!",

The lamb had a great taste to it at first but then later noticed it was super salty. Thankfully it was still bearable.   For drinks I got an old fashioned with bulleit bourbon and that was also good.

Strange policy, but okay.  I recommend securing your time slot online about 20-30 mins prior to when you'd like to dine. My husband went through the online request but it wasn't needed as we were sat right when we walked in. We went in just before 6pm.  We made it in time for HH (ends at 6) and were able to order some discounted drinks and apps. By the way-- the CRU margarita is delicious!  Our group ordered a variety of crunchy and regular tacos and were pretty pleased. The green Chile chicken was a little bland, but the crunchy pork and fish were very good. We took a gamble on their featured dessert taco and it fell a little flat.  Overall, a good dining experience and our friends said they'd try it again. Our waitress was extremely kind and helpful in making recommendations. We'll be back!",

    "text": "Very sophisticated and artistic tacos, it's an art gallery you can not only see but also smell, taste, and touch! The tacos really do look like works of art that are both appealing to the eyes and also palate.   We ordered the Duck Breast taco, the Tempura Avocado taco, Green Chile Chicken taco, 36 Hour Beef Short Rib taco, the Pheasant and Potato taco (taco of the week), and the Lamb taco. My absolute favorite was the Duck Breast, it was otherwordly! Tasted surreal. I never liked duck or pickled anything but almost every taco had a pickled vegetable and it went incredibly well with them. I feel converted. My second favorite was the Pheasant and Potato taco. And third favorite was the Green Chile Chicken taco.   The flavors in each taco are completely different from each other which is refereshing, and the flavors within each are a combination of complementary components. Yes, $5 for a taco might seem like a bit much but it's well worth it. You might end up loving a food or meat that you didn't like before, which is saying something.   We also had dessert which were strawberry tortilla tacos with strawberries, cream, and cake.  The bathrooms were neat and had large complementary images on them and the inside was slightly surreal as well as modern. Keeping with the theme of the restaraunt's concept.  Great execution in every aspect!",

Starting from the presentation to the flavors of the tacos It blew me away. We had Porkbelly, Korean chicken, Ahi tuna, and crunchy beef. All of them was flavorful and delicious!

Guac was very flavorful and they provided nice options of creamy green, tomatillo and a red salsa with mediocre chips.  I prefer super thin or thick like you get in Mexico.  Next course, Ahi Tuna taco with a Taro root shell, delicious sashimi grade simple dish with a few green onions on top.  Not too spicy for the tender tongues.  Three other tacos were served: Crispy pork belly, crispy beef and crispy green chile.  Not a fan of the quick kimchi on top of the pork belly, meat was very tasty.  The beef taco was my favorite, flavorful and the right amount of toppings.  Green chile my least favorite - not spicy enough, strange flavor. My friends and family loved the green chile taco, so it's a matter of taste.  Biggest blunder by the restaurant was they did not provide complimentary 'extra' salsa for the tacos.  I realize the chef has a certain flavor they are looking to achieve, yet for the patrons who are accustom to eating out regularly a side of salsa is a given at a taco joint.  Overall a four given the tasty dishes - know that these tacos are pricey ($5-6 per) so it's not your roadside taco stand!",

Pork belly and Korean chicken were a tad over salted as well but quite good.  I'd recommend going for happy hour, too pricey and tacos too small to make a full on meal.

The salsas were all really flavorful and the chips were nice and crispy. Our server actually ended up bringing out more chips for us since we still had some salsa left. Between my wife and I we tried the Korean fried chicken taco, the beef short rib taco, the pork belly taco, and lastly the crunchy beef taco. Overall, every taco had its own unique flavor. Pork belly was interesting how it was cut into small pieces but it is definitely in the fatty side. My top two were the short rib and the chicken taco. Short rib was super tender and had a good flavor and Korean fried chicken was probably the most unique. It had a very strong ginger flavor and the sauce was really good too. The shredded beef was seasoned really well in the crunchy taco. I will say that the main downfall about this place is the price in comparison to their portions. If you come and visit here I would highly recommend coming on happy hour so you can get more of a value. Tacos are really small and the price is a little high. However, you can tell that they are using quality ingredients so I didn't mind that much. Lastly, I got their happy hour margarita for $5 and that was a really good deal. Pretty strong marg for 5 bucks. Come check this place out for happy hour!",

But they are surely on the path as I do not know any other place here in the Valley which tries to go beyond regular tacos to create something that is fun and different. I hope to find more if these gems. To be fair what I appreciate about this lil taco place is they have dared to be different, hence the one extra star  I have tried most of their tacos and I think I love their ahi poke taco served in taro chip the best. I think the crunch of the chip balances the lovely textures of the poke.   I wish them luck and hope to see more places that bring innovative offerings to the Valley.  Hopefully they keep innovating as at some point I would love to see them bumped to a 5 star. If only they are more consistent.",

We tried several items on the menu- Korean fried chicken taco, pork belly taco, fresh guacamole and chips, beef crujiente, margaritas, and beef short rib tacos. EVERYTHING was excellent- bursting with unparalleled flavored and meticulously placed on your plate. Chef Hinojosa is well know in the valley and can be seen in the kitchen creating your dish. Jason, the owner, walks the dining room making sure everything is perfect. Try out these street tacos with a twist! You won't be sorry! I have been craving that Korean fried chicken taco ever since!",

Then we had the guacamole, delicious. Husband got the shrimp street taco, 36 hour short rib street taco and the lamb crunchy taco. I got the crunchy pork. Guys, the crunchy pork is sooooo good and melts in your mouth like the most amazing pork flavored potato chip you've ever had. Order that. Do it. Server said the beef crunchy is just as good. We'll do that next time. Great service too. This is a great neighborhood restaurant. Will definitely come back. Thank you to our great sever, Danielle! Compliments to the chefs as well!",

They have 2 sizes: 6 inch crispy and 4 1/2 inch soft. Our server carefully explained the menu, so we knew how to order. We started with a very fresh ceviche servicer with thin crisp chips. Next, we had beef and pork 6 in crispy tacos, short rib, Korean barbecue chicken, and fish tacos all of the smaller size. Although our favorite was the Korean chicken, all were very good. They have a decent selection of wine, beer, tequila, and mixed drinks. Happy hour prices are 3-6 pm, later on weekends, and all evening on Wednesday. Prices are fair for the quality, and happy hour will save you some $, too. Give this place a try!",

I've tried most of them and never get tired of this place. They have a Taco of the Week, that's off menu and only available for that week, and they've always been so good. The specialty margaritas are so freaking good I crave them!   It's not a big place and they have limited hours so definitely take advantage of the Yelp waitlist before you arrive. Also, parking is limited so carpool or catch a ride share.   Full bar (I've enjoyed some great beers here) yummy apps, great place to meet friends, bring out of town guests and have a fun night.   100% recommend. I've always had amazing service.",

Loved the margarita options the Arcadia had a great jalapeno kick.   Service was fast and attentive.   The space is fairly small with an open kitchen and some community tables.  Everything is made from scratch. As a vegetarian I found plenty of options but was slightly disappointed by the tempura avocado which I was so eager to try.  The mushroom taco was much more flavorful and unique in my opinion.  Nothing knocked my socks off but this was a fun, casual place to go with friends. Would certainly go back.",

They serve gourmet tacos, carefully prepared with premium ingredients that taste really really good, freshly made tortillas too...my only issue is to pay $6.50 for a taco that after tax and gratuity ends up $9! For a single 3in diameter taco?! See pics  So we had 4 tacos each plus one beer and paid over $110 with tip...yes you saw that just fine, our bill was over $110 buckaroos for 8 gourmet tacos and 2 beers, I'm still confused about how this happened although they were delicious...I'm giving 4 stars only because of their super high prices...",

Happy hour (3-6 pm)- woohoo!   $7 passion fruit margarita.  Wish it had a little bit more passion fruit flavor.  Nice balance of sweet, salty, spicy though.    $5 Garlic roasted mushroom taco was spot on. Lovely roasted gourmet mushrooms.  Garlic wasn't overwhelming,  but a nice balance of flavors and textures.  Definitely on the filling side.   $4 Korean fried chicken taco was tasty and pretty.   $4.50 crunchy pork taco wasn't too fatty,  but rich and delicious,  contrasted by the crunchy,  spicy,  savory cabbage slaw.  Excellent balance and probably my fav.   Little gnat kept flying around my plate, which was little annoying.    This is a hangout place to chill,  not if you're super hungry,  but want gourmet tacos in a cool environment.    Great little spot!",

The location is not the most romantic, being inside a small mall and next to CVS. They were out of Cazadores Blanco and Don Julio. And we almost missed happy hour. But then... it got better, a LOT better.  Our waitress recommended a tequila for our margaritas that was divine. One of the tastiest I've had. They have a larger selection of whiskys than other places we visited, and it seems they are working to expand their library of alcoholic beverages.   The staff worked together and helped us get our orders right before happy hour closed. All the tacos were creative and delicious. My friend and I split each taco so we could try as many as possible. These aren't the huge monsters you get at fast food places, but closer to the palm of my hand. They are filling though.  Highly recommend the green hot sauce. If you can handle the heat, you will absolutely love it. I wish I could take a bottle home with me. They take great efforts to elevate their food. For example, they bring the chips in bags rather than on plates so they stay crisp and warm. The noise level is decent. The interior is nice, and the designs inside the ceiling lamps are quite cool.  Jason, the co-owner, was extremely friendly and informative.  This is a joint for locals, unlike some of the newer establishments that seem a bit too touristy. Definitely coming back!",

The bar is long and the drinks are fancy but wonderful.   We started with the Salsa Trio, and everything about this antojito was perfection. The fresh tortilla chips are served in a paper bag, and served hot. This is served with 3 salsas, verde, pasilla, habanero (hot).  After eating these chips, I was not too hungry so I ordered two tacos - one crujiente and one taco de la calle. I decided to go with the Beef Crujiente with Cheddar-jack, cabbage, house hot sauce, pico de gallo  which was OK to me, I didn't feel like there was anything special about it.  For the Tacos de la Calle, I tried the Fresh Fish with citrus slaw and ancho tartar which I really liked.  The next time I revisit, I am going to try a specialty cocktail and some other tacos.  A lot of reviews I read, pork belly seems to be the favorite, so I might try that next!",

I'd recommend making a reservation ahead of time. We went on a Thursday at like 7 and it was still packed our wait was short but if you're impatient; that's the way to go. I got the passion fruit margarita without the Serranos and my date got the strawberry one without the habaneros (spicy alcohol is so weird to me) they both were strong but I liked his a bit more.   The tacos didn't disappoint. I got the Korean fried chicken, Texas Wagyu steak, and the special Korean short rib. It was such a nice, bougie switch up from my regular street tacos, I loved it! They even have dessert tacos which I'll have to come back and try hoping I like the speciality.   Date Rating: 2 out of 5. Tunde is like straight from Nigeria. Or so that's what he told me. He calls me a \"socialite\" but that's because he doesn't ever leave the area code of Tempe lol (I can't imagine why a grown man would refuse to venture away from a bunch of college kids but I digress) in his whole two years of living in the states so far he's never been anywhere else but a couple clubs in Old Town. How incredibly boring that you don't wanna explore your environment.  You know those kids you graduate with in high school that wanna become rappers and chase that dream well into their 20s? Well my dear friend Tunde is like that but wants to be a professional athlete. I'm a sucker for seeing people get all excited about what they love to do so it was kinda sweet seeing the stars in his eyes. I'm hoping that works out. When he made a comment about Chris Brown being on Beyonce's level in terms of performing, AFTER watching Homecoming; I knew I wouldn't be able to take him seriously.  And then we watched me eat while he didn't touch his food. All of these little things would not allow me to imagine this going further romantically. He was attractive and we laughed but it all just felt too buddy buddy. Or maybe it was because he wanted me to order for him and then I felt like his big sister. He apparently gets tables out in Old Town so I will be making an appearance and putting my friends on to all his friends. Someone around here deserves to get lucky after all my effort.",

The combinations and flavors are outstanding & the ingredients are top quality.  I had the Tempura Avocado Taco & 36 Hour Beef Short Rib Taco.  Both were amazing. I love beef short ribs and this was the most tender and flavorful I've ever had. Yes, they're small-just 3 bites, but well worth it. If you're going for dinner, you'll want to order 3-4, and maybe an appetizer.   Would have had more but we had just come from a pre-wedding party and had eaten quite a fews apps before. Next time we'll come hungry.",

Priced at $10 Let me tell you, there's no skipping on the pour here, it's Devine! The salsa trio, guacamole to die for, and ahi poke tacos, all amazing!  I always say you can tell a Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa, these chips come out in a brown paper sack, thin, crispy, salty perfection! This place is fairly small, but the atmosphere is great, music, bar feel, with cool decor.  Winner, winner, I'll be back!",

I came for Taco Tuesday since they have some pretty good deals on their tacos, and I ordered a Cru Paloma cocktail (it was ok) plus 3 tacos: pork belly (which was basically carnitas), beef short rib, and Korean fried chicken. I liked the Korean fried chicken one the best. It was crispy, fried-chickeny goodness with an amazing sauce. Second place goes to beef short rib, and third goes to pork belly (because it was good but not that different from a regular carnitas taco).   Finally, I got a dessert taco, which changes seasonally. Today's version was butter-fried carrot cake with a sweet goat cheese drizzle and pecans. It was amazing! I highly recommend it.",

We started with ceviche and posole rojo, which is a great meat stew and it is perfect for the recent cold weather. They were amazing but what really hit home run for us were the tacos and their drinks. We tried both tacos crujientes (crunchy tacos) and tacos de la calle (street tacos).   Beef tacos cruijentes - a solid hard shell taco packed with meat, fresh veggies and a little bit of kick.  Pork belly - juicy and flavorful. the kimchi topping, which is not your typical red kimchi but more like a pickled white cabbage, is a great touch.  Blue crab - a great solid crab taco. I love the avocado mousse they use on this taco. it was my friend's favorite. 36 hour braised beef short rib - super soft and lot of flavors this one! My husbands favorite but must warn you, it is spicy! korean fried chicken - I didn't order this one mostly because I'm korean and was afraid that my love for korean fried chicken would make me a harsh food critic. But my friend who's tried it said it was amazing. I'll have to give it a try next time.  As for drinks, they have an amazing drink selection - beer, wine, spirits.. you name it. I don't remember the names of all of them but we each had at least 3 cocktails because they were delicious. Also got to try the best mezcal I've had so far per the owner's recommendation - Crema de Mezcal. Lightly sweet and very smooth.   To top it off, everyone at the restaurant was very attentive and provided top-notch service. I recently moved out here from LA and my husband and I've been looking for our go-to spot. This place might be it for us. Service, food, vibe - Crujiente Tacos has it all.",

The 2nd Taco was the ahi poke. It had seaweed, green onion, kawasaki and sweet taste of taro root. Then I tryed there Taco of the week. It has white bean octopus and chorizo. I have never tryed some thing here and not enjoyed it. The pork belly I would say is still my favorite but the duck and octopus are right behind it. If you come you have to try these three tacos.

What did turn me off was brown paper bag for chips. Wtf, I paid $6 for chips and salsa and you can't give me a plate? That's not creative, that's lazy.   The street tacos are so well thought out! It's Mexican classics with Asian influence. I ordered the following tacos: Korean fried chicken, shredded beef crunchy, and avocado tempura. The best one was the crunchy beef, hands down! Everyone else also really enjoyed their tacos.   The waitress informed us that in 2 weeks they will begin margarita Monday's so will have to most certainly come back!!",

The handmade margaritas for $5 is the best ever. Definitely the best hh margarita I have had in a long time so I would frequent this spot for those alone. I tried the Korean chicken taco which was different, interesting and yummy. It's fried so probably not your healthiest taco but yummy and it's a street taco size so you don't have to feel too bad. My cousin tried the lamb taco which she didn't like but supposedly they are a fav so maybe try it for your self. I also ordered a quesadilla with chicken. It was not  the best. It was nice and crispy but it was gobs of cheese and even for a cheese lover you want more chicken than cheese which it was not. It was a kids and it was $10 so please more chicken than cheese. I would definitely come again but I would stick to the yummy CRU margaritas and the Korean chicken tacos and I would be a happy camper.",

It's a neat setup with plenty of seating for being a seemingly small space. We came on Tuesday so many of the tacos were discounted all night for taco Tuesday! We missed the happy hour cutoff, but ordered their house margarita anyway and it was worth the couple extra bucks! The margarita was simple, but so delicious-you can tell it's made with high quality ingredients. We started off with the salsa trio  & chips which was great. Between my husband, friend & myself we tried one of each of the taco CRUjientes (beef, lamb & pork) which were all delicious. Simple but well seasoned. We also had the Texas Wagyu Cap Steak, Pork Belly, Korean Fried Chicken & the 36 Hour Beef Short Rib. They were all delicious & put together so well! My favorite was the pork belly, but my husband raved about the wagyu steak. Jason, one of the owners stopped by the table and you can just really tell he is passionate about the place they've created. They don't just put any old toppings on a taco, they really do take the time & energy to craft their menu, tacos & drinks. We will definitely be back & can't wait to try their taco or the week!",

We went during Happy Hour (6 Days a week fri n sat too) and I highly recommend if you like trying different foods/flavors- your wallet will like you too! But really anytime works best for me, because it's worth every bite!  From the margaritas, ceviche, Mexican Caesar salad w roasted poblano dressing and ALL the tacos (although we didn't try the taco of the week - sweet potato), we did have every other taco on the menu (and except the tempura avocado and any of the CRUjientes tacos). Each and every bite was phenomenal. The pork belly, short rib and ahi poke stood out, if that's even possible, because just Yum on each and every flavor so different from the other!   As to all the people who wrote comments about size and price - you definitely get your money's worth here! And for the people who write about Bien Trucha or El Toda Madre (40 Miles outside of Chicago) there is NO comparison. Between the textures and differentiating flavors - there's Nothing we've found yet that even comes close to CRUjentes.   If you are a foodie and looking for a genuinely culinary experience, great service, clean and hip atmosphere and at a great price - mark your calendars today!",

Our server was very helpful and attentive.  She recommended doing both the hard and soft shell tacos, which is absolutely the way to do it.  I'm really hard pressed to pick a favorite between the lamb, fish, and shrimp tacos.   The guacamole was very flavorful and the corn appetizer was an unexpected score.  Cocktails were well balanced and delicious (their version of a Cadillac marg was fantastic).  The only constructive criticism I would have is that the hi def TVs at the bar should be larger given the distance from the seats.  Can't wait to come back here.

Great deals on Tecate during that time ($2.50 or $3).   We tried 4 different tacos and they all sounded so good, but were underwhelming.  We had the pork belly, Korean fried chicken, fish and short rib tacos.  The short rib was a bit tough.   My husband usually loves Korean fried chicken, but took one bite of this one and wouldn't eat any more.  Of the 4, I thought that one was the best.  We also had the salsa trio, which also was just OK.   Overall, nothing spectacular, but worth checking out.",

Waited about 15 minutes for the bubbles to settle and was still about one third foam and not even a full glass.

    "text": "(Lyrics - Bananarama - Cruel Summer)  Hot spicy sauce And my palates are burning I sit around Trying to Yelp and  The food is so good and fly Strange voices are singing (What did they sing)  Songs from the 80's  It's too close to my heart This drink has got Right out of hand  It's at Cru, it's at cru! CRUjiente! Leaving me here on my own It's at Cru, it's at cru! CRUjiente! Now with a song!  Tacos and whiskey.....what the funk!?  For me the two doesn't work well, but I had to give this a try.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed at all.  My friend and I started out with fresh made chips and guacamole. The chips came in a brown paper bag and once you open it; like fresh popped corn it was steaming!  The guacamole was thick and creamy with some onions, cilantro, and a hint of lime.  For our entrees we shot for the street tacos obviously!  I ordered the Short Ribs, Lengua, and Pork Belly tacos.  The Short Ribs were tender, but I thought the house hot sauce was so spicy; it over powered everything else on it.  The Lengua, was a bit chewy but all good cause the radish, onions, and cilantro helped with texture and the avocado & guajillo sauce gave it a mellow almost smoky bite.  The Pork Belly was probably my favorite cause it had crunchy bite along with the pungent kimchi sauce and siracha aioli giving it some kick.  As for whiskey, yeah I drink them, but I'm no connoisseur by any means.  The bartender recommended some for me and my friend and he seem knowledgeable about different brands and what we wanted.  There were different whiskey from other countries and well as price points.    In the end, Crujiente was a fun and great foodie experience.  The street tacos were fun since they have different toppings that I didn't get to yet, but plan to.  Whiskey lovers come and get your palates wet - wink! - Enjoy!",

We decided to meet some friends for dinner this time, and we made it just in time for happy hour.  I had the duck, tempura avocado, and tuna poke street tacos, which were all priced in the $4-6 range per taco.  Normally I wouldn't balk at paying this price; Phoenix has a large number of upscale taco restaurants which use gourmet ingredients and therefore charge a little more for their tacos than you might pay in a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.  However, the tacos at Crujiente are much smaller than other gourmet tacos that I've had.  Each taco was approximately two bites, which is fine if you're not hungry, but when you do the cost per bite math, these tacos are more expensive than sushi.  They were good, but not unique enough to justify the cost.  That said, we got the $5 margaritas off the happy hour, and those were worth every penny.    I'll probably find my way back here again, but it'll be for the margaritas, not the tacos.",

    "text": "This is a PHENOMENAL taco spot. If you're looking for tacos with a flare to excite your taste buds this is THE PLACE. TACOS: Their Blue Crab Taco has a light crispiness that is complimented with an avocado mousse that is absolutely AMAZING and goes to show they aim for TEXTURE- a go to for anyone willing to try something different in the taco world. It doesn't end here-their margaritas is a glass of goodness in itself...DRINKS: Arcadia Maragarita is the place to be the jalapeno adds the right heat and is cooled with a slice of cucumber all of which is swimming in top notch tequila....not done, DESSERT: A strawberry pico sitting in a Mexican spiced chocolate mousse with cinnamon sprinkled fried dough that had been drenched in sweetness.   But the food met with the kind of \"let-me-introduce-you-to-my-family\" kind of hospitality makes it a HOME RUN!   SUMMARY: This is a restaurant that presents with QUALITY in their tacos, drinks, sweetness, and service.   I will be back again and that's a GUARANTEE.",

The gochujang sauce on the Korean taco has the right amount of heat for most people without being overpowering. The lamb taco was perfectly balanced. The pork belly taco was good but missing a little something for me. The service was spot on and attentive without being overwhelming.",

Again oh my freaking yumminess!!!!!  My fave!!  Also, had under 'Tacos De la Calle':   Pork Belly (house quick kimchi, cilantro & sriracha aioli) & their award winning Korean Fried Chicken (gochujang, mojo de cebollin, compresses cabbage). Very light & nice flavors.   Under 'Antojitos':  Aguachile (New Caledonia prawn, lime, jalapeno, radish & cilantro.  Truly Fresca tasting: little avocado balls was so clean & fresh tasting almost like off the vine fruit taste. Mmmmm.   And my specialty cocktail was absolutely perfectly balance, clean, & delicious:  Whiskey Mango Foxtrot (Makers Mark 46 Bourbon, ginger, mango jalapeno shrub & orange bitters).   Great music, service (Joe was great) &  atmosphere!!  They are passionate about food & restaurant and you can tell.   PS: no to go orders per chef. He's that proud & passionate that his food being optimal yumminess.   Definitely taste the pleasures!!  PSS:  Mmmmm getting yummier on 2nd time & I swear I can't decide lol: Lamb Tacos Crujientes (flavorful, moist, not gamey deliciousness), the Pisco Kid cocktail (Porton Pisco, elderflower, lime, berry blossom white tea syrup, mint, grapes -save grapes for last because best tasting grapes when it's all infused), Pork Belly Tacos De Le Calle (nice smoky flavor came through tonight).   All of it was amazingly delish!  Also, on special kids menu: munchkins love it with ooooooey gooooooey cheese but still grown up enough w/tastiness for kiddos who usually don't prefer kids menu because sometimes being bland-not here yummm!",

The margaritas are delicious and so is the guacamole.  We visited on Wednesday when it was happy hour all day!  And Tuesday's are all day taco happy hour!

Perfectly spiced and the chips had just the right amount of salt. It was my birthday so we got a couple of the seasonal dessert tacos, which happened to be the cheesecake tacos. The strawberries were fresh and tart, the basil was an amazingly fresh touch, however it was all placed on a corn tortilla which was quite overpowering. The atmosphere was so classy, yet relaxed. The bathroom was clean and bonus points for the playlist! (Puscifer came on!) They offered a couple different beers from a collaborative with The Belching Beaver and The Deftones, which I was very excited to try. The hour drive from Surprise was definitely worth it!",

    "text": "Super delicious! I tried their famous Korean fried chicken taco, pork belly taco, and CRUjiente beef. Loved all three of them.  I would say the Korean fried chicken taco was my favorite.  The display itself was beautiful -- fried chicken coated in orange sauce on top of light colored kimchi, and few drops of decorative green and black sauces.  Note the food is on the spicy side (and I can eat spicy!!) so we had to order cheese quesadilla for my daughter. But it again was dummy!   Overall, I will definitely visit again.  And, great value for the happy hour!!!",

Happy hour is a screaming deal. Margs are so good. Even the house margarita is delish. Literally order anything on this menu. You  will  not  be  disappointed    They have done an amazing job woth seating. Room for everyone in a small space, but it feels huge. The community table is a great touch, and provides quick turnover.   Tacos. Lord the tacos. Order one, or order every one. The flavors blend so well. Our friends tried comparing Crujente to Taco Guild and I about slapped them.   Please eat here. It's life changing.",
