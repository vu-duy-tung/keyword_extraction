    "text": "This was our first time here even though Ive lived nearby for almost 3 years now. The atmosphere is great. We went kind of early, around 9am on a Saturday and it wasnt very crowded. No wait at all for a table. Love the free serve yourself beverage bar. We started with a lemon poppyseed muffin, which was probably the highlight of the meal. The muffin top was sugar-coated and delicious. My fiance ordered the monte cristo, which we had high hopes for. While the french toast bread was great, there wasnt much cheese or meat on the sandwich to properly proportion it to the 2 thick slices of toast. I had the omelette with the gravy sauce which was very good. Only wish it had more delicious gravy for the roasted potatoes it came with! There were plenty of other menu items i would like to try and seeing how this place is nearby and not too expensive i definitely think we will be back!",

    "text": "09/30/12  Had brunch here with my aunts and Mom.  While they placed orders for the American Breakfast, which consisted of two Hickman Farm eggs, over medium, home fries, a buttermilk biscuit, and applewood smoked bacon ($8.95) and the Rustic French Toast, whose description read rustic bread, apple butter, candied pecans, and warm syrup ($8.95), an aunt and I walked over to The Farm Kitchen to order a couple of sandwiches.  When we arrived back to MGC, we were surprised to find a bustling cafe, since it was a very warm afternoon.  However, it's always nice to see local restaurants busy any time of the year.  :)  Mom and I always get the Monte Cristo, or the French Toast, and I swear every time we order the toast, it always looks different.  The best version we ever had it here was the first two times we tried it, years ago.  The photographs were already taken down long ago (?), but no matter- we still remember how great they were.  The first time, I asked if we could have bananas added, and so we were presented with a lovely plate of French toast with caramelized bananas, mixed berries, and pecans.  The second time, the kitchen ran out of bananas, so we just had blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, and chunks of candied pecans.  The last time we visited, we were told absolutely no additions could be made, but Mom wanted to try it, anyway.  Suffice it to say, she wasn't happy with the product.  So, I was surprised when we arrived and was told it was ordered.  It took awhile to arrive, but I must admit that when it did, my aunt and I enjoyed it! I didn't see much of the candied pecans, though... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix?select=-wT5mZbSdPEuVjHRrusuRg#-wT5mZbSdPEuVjHRrusuRg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/morn...</a>  The American Breakfast was a sad sight to see... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix?select=ikrbRBUgz1Q-qYiH2ao_QQ#ikrbRBUgz1Q-qYiH2ao_QQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/morn...</a>  Two thin strips of bacon, ONE egg, a tiny biscuit, and home fries.  Are you kidding me?  I justified the price of the dish by telling my aunts everything on the plate was organic and/or locally-produced.  I've yet to ask what the verdict was on this dish- stay tuned!  Great atmosphere, not so much the heat.  Will come back once the weather cools!",

We ate and thankfully weren't riding together, so we stopped about 3 miles down the road to get something else to eat as we were still hungry.    Staff couldn't keep the coffee carafes full.  Patrons brought their dogs, who didn't like the other dogs so our breakfast time was spent with a ton of barking back and forth.   Self serve beverage is great, if it's free - which it is not and for the prices, should be.   The facilities were upgraded port-o-potties.  At least there was running water and electricity, right.  This place could be so much better.   Oh and PS - staff needs to make a sweep of the grounds/dining area. Huge dead and squashed bugs (yes plural) on the patio blocks in not appetizing and probably bad for all the dogs that visit too.",

For around $14 it was of decent size and very tasty. Today that we visited, we waited for around 30 minutes for a table which was fine because of the scenery. When we ordered our usual we received a plate full of potAtoes and the omelette was nowhere in sight, I thought they had brought the wrong order. Then when it was put down I saw this tiny omelette that looked like they only used one egg. The biscuit was bigger that the actual omelette. In that case, just name it home fries with a side of omelette. We were so disappointed that we had to fill up with coffee. Im sorry but the place cannot forget that people go there to actually eat. I regret not taking a pic to prove why we were so insulted. The worst part is that I looked around and everyones plate looked somewhat decent. While the little bite i got was delicious, we wont be going back. I recommend looking up other places if you are planning to actually eat. The star is for the nice farm and the rooster that was walking around.",

We went for breakfast this week & were surprised to see picnic tables were now the norm instead of tables with full back chairs.  Rebar was used as the \"legs\" of the table which you keep banging your knees on.  Sitting at picnic tables is NOT comfortable at best but with a back injury, unbearable.  The waitress did take it upon herself to find a chair without even being asked.... Much appreciated.  She said the table change was new this season.  Obviously ownership didn't want patrons to stay long.   For the prices, we should be as comfy as possible & be served our coffee.  Coffee was great, water was even great.... That was kinda it.  Muffin a bit dry.  Bacon meh... Salsa omelet was over cooked as were potatoes.   Wish I'd ordered the turkey sausage.   As much as we hate to cross this off our list, the tables are not a positive change.  Replace the few broken \"floor\" tiles, too.  Trip hazard.   We hate to check this off our list but we'll return when you change the tables back to something more comfortable.",

We had our 2 dogs with us and when we put our name on the list, were told it would be ~1.5 hr wait. As the crowd dwindled, and about 1.75 hr had gone by, we realized we had been selectively skipped on the guest list. We learned that there was limited seating (3 tables) that were \"for parties with dogs\". We eventually spoke with a manager as the restaurant has ample outdoor seating (with numerous other open tables at that time) and we were seated fairly quickly. She did provide service recovery, but it was really hard to get past the initial disrespect we experienced. I don't intend to return to this establishment and won't be recommending it to my friends. My expectations would have been better aligned with the experience if I had not been expecting a \"dog-friendly\" brunch. The Farm itself is a neat recreational area with open markets.",

We grabbed some coffee and browsed around the area for a bit since the day was beautiful. They sat us down. The waitress was a bit rude yet tried to be funny. The kind of rude where you don't know if that was a joke or not. Kinda awkward. Out of the 7, 5 of us were eating. None of us had complicated special orders we orders the basic breakfast plate. It was pretty packed so we automatically expected to be a wait for our food. However everyone who sat down after us and ordered after us got their food first. We waited almost an hour and a half for simple breakfast food! It wasn't until the birthday girl got up and asked the manager what was going on to the response she got was \"we are short staffed in the kitchen\" ok that still has nothing to do with why the people around us all got their food first when they sat down way after us. We eventually got our food. My plate was delicious. Others had runny scrambled eggs and cold over easy eggs. I gave 2 stars because my food was good and they took a percentage off our check.",

And though I understand the appeal of eating outside at the farm, it was very distracting to have flowers/seeds falling from the trees onto our table through the entire meal. Were the chefs planning our meals around this additional food from the sky? Also, when I pointed out the decaf coffee was empty they said they'd fill it but did not even though I kept on eye on it throughout our meal.  But these are small complaints. Overall the food is good.",

    "text": "I went to the Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast early on a weekend day.  The patio is very nice for sitting in a garden type atmosphere and the service was good and very friendly.  However, the food was at best OK, and worst disappointing, as I was expecting above the ordinary.  I ordered a sausage, tomatoe and cheese omlette  that came with \"home fries\", and a buttermilk biscuit.  The omelette was OK, as the tomatoes were a puree drizzled across the top of the eggs, cheese was minimal and hardly noticeable, and the sausage spicy and tasty, with the omlette prepared well as light and fluffy.  The \"home fries\" were cold, over spiced and I ended up eating a bite or two.  The buttermilk bisquit was also disappointing as it was hard on the outside and fairly tastless, only butter and strawberry jam made it acceptable.  I expect flaky, soft centered, bisquists that melt in my mouth and this one tasted like it had been cooked 2 days before and left to dry out.  Maybe other items on the menu would have been more delectable, but I was so disappointed in my breakfast I will not make the trip again to this location.",

We were greeted quickly and given menus, which differ on weekdays from weekends: It's more limited. There were still plenty of choices tho.   Our guest ordered the Farm Monte Cristo and coffee. My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros with coffee while I ordered the \"Pork is the New Black\" Omlette plus tea.   Our brunches arrived in less than 10 minutes. Our guest commented on her Monte Cristo: \"Oh, it's not battered and fried\".  She liked the Farm version much better than the traditional one!  My wife enjoyed her Huevos as well. My plate was really well thought out: plenty of meats, cooked perfectly with a bit of char, eggs just right, cheesy, melted goodness on top and smothered in gravy.   I highly recommend The Farm and the Morning Glory Cafe.",

Very cute place to get good food and some fresh air. There are chickens and big fields and lots of good picture ops, the wait was really long though we waited probably about an hour but it's nice to just walk around while u wait. When we did get in, we sat on the patio, I'm actually not sure if there was tables inside but there might have been. But our server (can't remember her name but she had dark hair and bangs) was really attentive, after waiting about an hour we already knew what we wanted. Their menu was decently sized and had something for everyone, I got the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend got the chiliquiles, and we got our dog a side of turkey sausage. it took about 30 mins to get the food out which to us wasn't bad because of how busy it was and how fresh the food was! It was very very good, just the right amount of spicey, pretty large portions I ate half and the side of potatoes and was perfectly full and had my other half to take home with me. The prices were fair considering how fresh the food is and the atmosphere and experience is definitely worth it. Although the drinks are self serve your server does put them on the ticket! Our bill came out to about $40 which I thought was a great deal. The only thing I recommend to this place was our table was right next to the restroom door and it was too close for people to get in and out. Also I was kinda terrified we were gonna get pooped on by the birds over head because the whole patio is pretty much covered with trees which is awesome but it would be great if they could get some umbrellas for the tables. Also the poor hostess at the front needs some buzzing table things to let people know their table is ready  or maybe a megaphone haha.",

After we were seated we were told that we can get our own tea, coffee, water, which was easily accessible.

While waiting for our breakfast we wandered a bit, my daughter and I enjoyed time taking pictures of pretty flowers. At your leisure you could help yourself to water, tea, coffee, or fresh lemonade. I ordered the farm burrito & home fries while my daughter ordered the banana french toast(which gave a few of us food envy) with a side of sausage. Lucky for us the portion was large and she shared, even took some home. Good service and everything tasted  farm fresh and fabulous.",

    "text": "I have to agree with Helen Y. I love the atmosphere at the Farm at South Mountain. However, the Morning Glory Cafe left much to be desired.   I didn't mind the wait, as that's typical during weekend brunch. I especially loved that we were lucky enough to get a table on the outside of the layout so that I could keep my bike near me while we ate. Unfortunately, there is no good way to lock your bike up while on the property from what I could see. And this isn't just because I'm overprotective about my bike (though we all know I am).  The service was fairly good. Our sever kindly answered all our questions and dealt with our crazy bill splitting. Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time and all at the same time too :)  On recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items. For some reason the eggs Benedict just seemed overly spiced to me, and I love spice. The home fries didn't look or taste right either, though I've seen pictures of them looking delicious :-/  As far as beverages go, the revolution individual herbal teas are the awesome. I didn't even know revolution made those. LOVE. Also loved the way my friend's mimosa came, with a small carafe of orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. Individual sized things are also the awesome.  One other small note... crayons for the tables would be awesome if you always use the white paper as a tablecloth!!  Will I come back again? Probably. There were a lot of items on the menu that looked delicious. I had a piece of the apple-wood bacon and it was heaven.",

I did not detect one bit of truffle essence in this dish. My fiance ordered the Cowboy Breakfast. It was like watered down chili with and egg on top. No great.

The Morning Glory Cafe is located at the Farm at South Mountain which has their own organic farm on premise. Their hours are limited to serving breakfast - but, oh my, do they do breakfast good!  I ordered Chef Manuel's chicken enchiladas topped with two eggs over easy. I know, I know - it's a cardio slam, but it was worth every biteful! The enchiladas were filled with an herb roasted chicken breast that was savory and moist. The tomatillo sauce that topped the entire dish was one of the best I've ever had - a little bit of tang, but oh so flavorful! I sat savoring every single bite!  The beverages are self-service. The coffee, tea, orange juice and lemonade are available.",

    "text": "Morning Glory (along with the Farm Kitchen, the other more casual dining spot at the Farm at South Mountain) re-opened on September 9th after being closed for the summer. We missed being able to go there for breakfast, but on the other hand, would not have been happy or comfortable sitting outside with a hot breakfast in the broiling Phoenix sun and my thighs sticking to the plastic chair. Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress.   I have three reasons for my update:   1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right.  2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it.  3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff.   Definitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out. I don't think the lunch spot (Farm Kitchen) is as delicious, so if you're only going to pick one of the two, definitely try Morning Glory. Of course, you could also opt for Quiessence, the formal restaurant at the Farm, which I still haven't tried but hear is awesome. A sign at the Farm said they are now open for lunch and afternoon snacks. But, again, I digress.",

It is a truly special place, with a massage center, little chalets, an artists' colony, gardens (yes, various plants grow in the beautiful Sonoran desert). I could, but won't, go on and on about the scenery and the vibe of the place. Suffice it to say that the Heard Family, of Heard Museum fame, bought this acreage many years ago, in order to preserve its beauty. Recent owners have only improved on the site.  The restaurant itself appears to have an indoors and an outdoors section; we sat on the beautiful patio with ample shade and hummingbirds. Beverages (water, tea, coffee, and lemonade) are self-served and refills are endless. The menu is seasonal and rotational, varying with the availability of produce on the farms. Breakfast is heavy on eggs, though I had savory crepes with shrimp in a bechamel sauce with fresh garden herbs. And bacon.   This location reminds me of why I love the desert, though I never forgot.",

You're paying for ambiance and serenity when you eat at Morning Glory Cafe, which is sometimes worth it. Today was a beautiful day to eat on the patio with friends, however, I found the food overpriced for what it was...and not just because I'm a cheap-ass, even my DINK friends thought it was pricey.  The unlimited coffee was pretty nice, though I heard average reviews from the other 8 people in my group on their food. My taco shells with eggs were good, but I could make something just as good at home for half the price.   The grounds are simply beautiful though (5 Stars for them), so you're paying for the luxury of enjoying their beautiful farm and fresh produce. We walked around and looked at the chickens, strolled the vast lawns, and perused the gift shop. Overall a nice way to spend a Saturday morning in the beautiful weather.",

    "text": "When somebody says \"breakfast in Phoenix,\" this place instantly jumps to the top of my mind.  I'm always shocked when I hear that people have lived in Phoenix and never been here and some never heard of it. I suppose this truly is a \"hidden gem\" as people say. I generally make a point of taking any visiting friends or family here at least once. It really can't be beat; from the food, to the servers, to the whole ambiance, Morning Glory is top notch.  The entire place is outdoors, in the shade of large, beautiful trees. The food is made from fresh, local ingredients. Families and friends are sitting around enjoying the experience. People bike up, and some even bring their dogs. Local vendors can be seen at times selling honey, jam, oil, bread and music unobtrusively in the yard. You can even see and walk over to the gardens and chicken coops where some of the wonderful ingredients come from!  I hope this place never changes.",

Food was delicious. I had the omelette and the gravy made all the difference. Potatoes were tasty. Bloody Mary was okay. The strawberry jam was excellent. Would I return? Yes - if I had nothing else to do and was willing to sacrifice 2+ hrs of my day.",

    "text": "In my past career life, I worked near South Mountain and during my lunch hour, I eagerly searched for cuisines to peak my interest. I'd overhear coworkers chatting about a \"farm\" and I wondered if I possibly worked with a bunch of former farmers? Then I stumbled past the Farm one day and experienced Morning Glory Cafe for the first time. That first time turned into many many more visits and I still try to make my way to the south side from time to time.   Burgers. Yes, I do like burgers. It's an all American cuisine so therefore I don't think I should be judged. Well, the Morning Glory Cafe burger is tastilicious. It's so good I had to combine two words. The breakfast is scrumptious and they have a tasty brunch as well. Full of fresh ingredients, each item on the menu has its own unique taste. And the baked goods. Oh my baked goodness. Try the scones.   The atmosphere is adorable and filled with character. Hidden in the middle of a \"farm\" you could pass by this little gem in the desert and never realize it was just past the main road. Whenever I enter, I feel like I've left Arizona and I've been transported to a little farm in California. I love the quaint feel the Morning Glory Cafe gives me. It isn't a big and open restaurant full of hustle and bustle. Instead, it's a small and intimate setting and I feel like I am having lunch at a friend's home on a Saturday afternoon. It was the perfect escape from the work day. Oh and I could get in and out and still make it back within the hour.   So if you're ever in the vicinity of South Mountain and looking for a little escape from desert reality, give Morning Glory Cafe a try.",

My husband had the eggs benedict and he was happy as a clam. The food was very tasty and presented beautifully. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ, it was very tasty. My husband had the free refill coffee. I love the outside seating arrangement though it was a little chilly this morning. We let our toddler run and explore right outside of the restaurant area while we had our breakfast.  The menu is small, but I'm sure they make everything well, I'd rather have a small well done menu, than a menu with so many options the kitchen can't do it all well. I love that they source locally and I love that they are environmentally friendly. Right up my alley. We'll be back soon!",

We had all read this message on the cafe's website:  \"From 6/4 to 6/19 Morning Glory will only be Open on Weekends.\"  Wouldn't you think that means they are still open on Thursday June 2nd?  Apparently, they meant to say \"closed weekdays starting 5/30\", but aren't so good with the English language.  Oh well, it's a beautiful farm and almost worth driving out here just for the scenery. Ok, not really. If you are reading this, Morning Glory owners, please learn to communicate your seasonal closing dates  correctly next year.",

It has a broken-down rustic charm and is a great way to spend a Sunday morning or afternoon.  I'm disappointed to say that I'm disappointed with the Morning Glory Cafe. The service is just ok and unyielding (i.e. when my fiance asked for a side of chili the waitress said, \"no, we don't do anything like that here\", making it sound like an outrageous demand). And although I LOVE that the food is made from locally produced/grown animals/vegetables, it's a bit lacking in taste and high in price. $60 for one muffin, two breakfast plates, and tip? A little pricey for breakfast in my opinion.  Overall, the experience of the Farm at South Mountain is one you can't miss. My advice, though: bring a picnic. There are plenty of benches and picnic tables throughout the Farm.",

I felt so embarrassed for inviting them without having been there in a few months.    1. They have changed the menu. The breakfast tacos (the reason I picked this place), waffles, and some omelets are gone  2. They changed the french toast. The new version was horribly disappointing with Marscapone Cheese and Raisin Bourbon Syrup. Both my wife, myself, and friends would have preferred the old candied pecan.  3. Disappointing food:   - The \"home fries\" were dry, cold, stale, and very chewy with no seasoning at all.    - Biscuits and gravy were disappointing. Gravy had poor flavor and the biscuits were flat, and burned   - Eggs were very rubbery - I had to cut them with a knife.  4. Some items are way overpriced. $2.50 for 1 egg??. I can but a dozen of the Hickman's eggs that are used at the grocery store for that price.   The one highlight of our visit was the Farm Monte Cristo. It was very flavorful and the Peppered Bacon Syrup was delicious. After this visit, I will not be back for a long time.",

Over the years, I've attended a wedding, shopped their produce stands, visited their art studio, breathed some fresh air and picked up organic greens and chicken eggs. Back to my Morning Glory impressions! Located in back, we drove to its parking lot. We sat outside and ordered juices, coffee and hot cocoa.  My 8oz cranberry juice at $3.50 , l thought was a bit pricey especially when it is served in a disposable plastic cup. I expected a \"greener approach\".   I chose their breakfast special, a meddley of sauteed veggies (bell peppers, squash, potatoes, onions...) topped with over easy eggs.  My friends chose the Montecristo brioche sandwich and my hubby chose the All American breakfast.  Montecristo was a two thick slices of brioche, folded eggs and ham bathed in syrup. All American was eggs any style, sausage, biscuit, cubed potatoes. My \"special\" was not special. Veggies were overcooked and oily, soggy.  I was looking forward to eating locally grown produce but their kitchen killed it. Four very average breakfasts, 1 coffee, 1 cranberry juice, 1 hot cocoa later, (all served in non recyclable cups), including tips totalled $86. Morning Glory is out of line.",

My group of 10 lucked out with not having to wait since we arrived after 12 and they close at 1. Plenty of seating was available with space for us to be comfy. The outdoor setting added to our fun, long-awaited breakfast. The entire place is a beauty!  At first we were told that the self-serve drinks were free.... but not so much after all of us had gotten up and picked a drink and our waitress told us wrong. $3.50 seems a little outrageous for lemonade/tea/coffee. Besides that issue, we loved the meal. All of us got something different off the menu. My \"Port is the New Black\" breakfast was absolutely fabulous. I'm not a fan of ham for breakfast so it was no problem to sub for extra sausage.   Since we were a group of 10 we were unable to split the check. That signage is quite clear on the menus. It's understandable that a small place doesn't want to split for more than 6",

We passed it up the first time around and then parked across the street before realizing we could have driven inside to a small parking lot.   We then had a long walk through gardens and trees but it was nice.  Once there it was peaceful outdoor seating under the trees with birds chirping.  The food was absolutely delicious!  My husband thought his Eggs Benedict were there best he ever had.  The eggs were perfectly done.  I had the Monte Cristo French Toast which was great.    It was get your own drink service but the food was brought out to you.  The amount of food was ample as well so the leisurely walk back to the car was welcomed.  This was a little country oasis in the midst of the city.   If we are in Phoenix again around breakfast or brunch time, we will definitely be back again.",

On the south end adjacent to Morning Glory, resides a quaint gift shop that sells little trinkets and sauces.  Usually the wait isn't too long, but just being able to sit and view the beautiful property will make time pass and you'll be seated before you know it!    I love the juevos rancheros here (eggs prepared over easy) the mimosas are delicious and if you get the Bloody Mary make sure to order it spicy! I used to love Bloody Mary's but for some reason they've all been made very thick and I didn't like that.  After the BM I had here, it made me like them again but I will probably only order them here from now on.  The Farm as a whole is a wonderful place.  You can visit here if you just want to have a picnic.  It is simply a peaceful place where you feel time freezes for a moment and you actually forget that you're in Arizona for a bit.  Keep up the amazing work!",

There are several restaurants on the property and the only one with breakfast is MG located at the far back.  So don't make the mistake we did and stop at the first one - keep on going til you can't go no more.  And be prepared that all the dining for this place is outside under some large trees.  Prices were a little higher than other places BUT you have to consider that they are using a lot of fresh produce grown right there so that's worth something.  I seriously LOVED the biscuit - homemade, tender and very slightly saltyish.  It was fantastic.  Not a huge fan of the self-serve coffee and juice thing but it definitely is efficient for the servers.  Service was great.  Take some time afterwards to walk around the perimeter and visit the little shop and pick up some fresh veggies.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  Situated on a produce farm with huge pecan trees lining the road through the farm, it is an oasis.  Being from the east coast, I miss real trees.  When you arrive, you'll almost always see families having picnics in the grass, people bring their dogs, and you can freely roam the farm.  Several restaurants exist here, pass the lunch spot that is closest to the main road and go to Morning Glory.  Not the deal of the century (average price is $11 per entree), but you can have as much coffee as you want, and it's worth it to sit outside in the middle of green farm.  The food is fresh, local if not directly from the farm, and very good.  I've eaten all the veg items, they've happily eliminated meat from anything I asked, and everything is good.  Ask for sauces on the side to be safe.  The biscuits are wonderful and herbed, as are the potatoes.  I often order these two sides with one entree to share with my significant other - PLENTY of food, especially with a bloody mary (or mimosa).  The real reason to come here is for the atmosphere. If  you can possibly avoid Sat and Sun, do it, because this place may be hidden from some, but the hotels know to send guests here.  Be prepared for a wait, but it's not at all a bad think to explore the surroundings.",

    "text": "I was far too embarassed about my first visit to the Morning Glory Cafe to do a proper yelp.  My advice: don't take vitamins on a empty hangover stomach then allow your breakfast buddy to order really jiggly Eggs Benedict.  Every bump to the table was pure torture for hypersensitive gag reflex. But despite my unflattering visit to restroom trailer, I absolutely loved the food and knew I would be back.  Today I managed to convince my husband to go to the Farm for breakfast, which is a minor feat in and of itself.  But I am happy to report that the breakfast was just as awesome as I promised my hubby that it would be. - The setting is beautiful, green, and soothing - The beverages are far above average.  Coffee that doesn't get bitter as it cools and freshly squeezed orange juice. - The staff is friendly and wonderful. - The meal comes out ridiculously quick.  It makes me wonder what takes so long at other breakfast joints.   - The food is divine.  The omelets are the best omelets I have ever eaten with fresh ingredients from the farm within sight of our table.  We even heard the chickens while we were sitting there because it was early and the restaurant was nearly empty.  The rosemary potatoes are perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The hubby was equally impressed with his simple breakfast of eggs, bacon and pancakes with real maple syrup.  He even noticed that the portion size was perfect and that substandard breakfast restaurants compensate for mediocre meals with a greater quantity of food. - The meal is a bit pricey for breakfast, but I didn't mind one bit.  I can't afford regular visits but I really wish I could.  We paid $37 for two meals, two coffees and 1 screwdriver (not on the menu, but they have the ingredients). - I do have one complaint, but I'm not sure if it's really a complaint or just a personal preference.  I hate biscuits.  They taste like dehydrated unbaked dough and I have no idea why any human would willingly eat one.  Morning Glory Cafe's biscuit is as horrible as any other I have tried.  Maybe for you biscuit-eaters out there it may actually be decent. - I felt like a humungous dork for doing this, but we talked about the breakfast for hours.  It was incredibly tasty and we kept discussing it to verify that we both experienced this perfect breakfast and to reinforce our experience.",

We were a table of two adults and four children - all ordering from the adult menu.  Our waitress was quick to take our order, but the food took exceptionally long and we had to ask twice for something that had been forgotten.  After the meal, we waited a bit to get our check but sent her back immediately with a credit card.  After about five minutes we were told they were experiencing computer issues so it would be another moment or two.  Had she been up front about the delay, we'd have been more understanding but having to track her down on more than one occasion was a little bit of an annoyance.  I'd like to go back, sans kids, to try out both the lunch and dinner restaurants.  I love that everything was separate and we enjoyed watching both a morning wedding AND the farmers picking beautiful flowers while we ate.

Our resident avian expert deduced that their red flesh bald patches were due to pecking each other rather than mange or being bird flu hosts, but that would have scared me off the eggs even though they were probably more decoration than layers.  Well, it would have been a shame to miss the terrific eggs benedict (good hollandaise, not too tart) and S. Mtn. omelettes (made with fresh vegetables from the \"Farm\" portion.  The lemonade didn't taste fresh squeezed, but I can't say much about others' food since we fell upon it so ravenously that we didn't offer any tastes.  The waitress apologized for the long wait which I hadn't noticed because of the good company, pleasant surroundings (except for air conditioning unit whine), and self-serve beverages.  Come to think of it, that was an appalling wait for breakfast fare - maybe the sudden intake of food, advancing heat, or charm of the outdoor setting went to Hostage Gastronome's head, and he left a 30% tip!  I didn't mind the extra few dollars, but felt he sent the wrong message that it's okay to capitalize on one's popularity without providing sufficient staffing.  I'm glad they do offer this alternative to the generic and/or commercial - just get more kitchen help!",

There were 2 pieces of asparagus, 2 pieces of string bean, 2 pieces of carrot strips and 2 paper thin pieces of pepper along with 1 tiny piece of the end of a broccoli floret.  The omelet was luke warm.  I ordered the Morning Glory Benedict.  The eggs were close to hard boiled with 7 small pieces of \"Home Fries\" and my meal was also luke warm at best.  Our small overpriced OJ's ($3.50 each) were slightly cool not cold.  Overall, the service was poor to fair, the food was fair to poor and the prices very high, given what you get",

Husband and I both ordered eggs \"over medium;\" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. \"Home fries\" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, \"yes\" as a reply, but they didn't offer to help in any way.   For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places I'd rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service.",

The french toast was melt in your mouth and the over easy eggs added a nice level of texture.  I was a little scared when I saw the sandwich drowning in maple syrup, but was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't overly sweet.  I also liked getting my own coffee as I felt their service was a little slow.  I have been looking for a brunch joint in Phoenix and I think I found a winner.    Oh yeah, this is also a nice place to bring your 4-legged friend if you have one.",

As we were walking up to the place, I said \"O now this is the kind of place we should be taking our out of town visitors.\". Well, on 2nd thought, NO. We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Quiessence, so of course, I think the quaint farm setting at Morning Glory is lovely, and I truly enjoy the cuisine of Chef LaPrad (for those of you who don't know, both restauarants are on the same farm premises and LaPrad is at the head of them).  Needless to say, the food is far superior & fresher than your standard breakfast diner fare.  It is also better than many other Valley breakfast stalwarts, such as Matt's Big Breakfast (which is quite tasty, but pretty greasy and their menu is nowhere near as creative or interesting as Morning Glory's).    The omelette I ate there a few days ago was, as ever, wonderful - the combination of fresh veggies with goat cheese and home made salsa verde was delicious.  That said, I was very disappointed when I visited this weekend, mostly on two accounts:  1.  The orange juice was not freshly squeezed; it was the Minute Maid style stuff most restaurants bring in pre-made.  This one surprised me because on my first visit to Morning Glory  the OJ was freshly made and natural.  This is a serious pet peeve I have with breakfast places - all too often at other places, servers nod and smile when you ask if the orange juice is freshly squeezed, only to bring you the usual packaged stuff one finds at the supermarket fridge.  It isn't that hard - were the oranges physically squeezed in the back or not?  For a place like Morning Glory that prides itself on organic ingredients, fresh produce, etc, there is no excuse to be serving this kind of OJ.  It's pathetic, and anyone can easily  discern the difference.  If I wanted this kind of juice, I would've gone to a corporate breakfast diner chain like Denny's or Ihop.  Come on.  2.  No pancakes on the menu, which was aparently tinkered with.   I'm pretty certain I had eaten pancakes here before....with them being such a fundamental breakfast classic, I can't figure out the warped reasoning behind not having them on the menu now.  Forget the pancakes....it's not a choice I would have made, but fine.  The orange juice issue, however, tells me their standards are beginning to slip, so I'd be careful if I was the manager.  This is how any restaurant's downward spiral starts: with complacency and lax standards.  I hate giving them a lukewarm review, but other than that, still a solidly recommended place.",

Liked that all food is grown on the property so I knew it would be fresh.  Had a tasty omelet that could've been bigger and WARMER when it hit our table.  Home fries were pretty cold.  Taste was good, temperature needs help by a warming light and/or wait staff to get it to table sooner.  Lots of pepper in food I ordered...I liked it, my friend wasn't thrilled w/ pepper taste.  You can't beat atmosphere at restaurant and surrounding farm area for a lovely stroll.  5 Stars for location and atmosphere, 3 stars for SIZE of omelet and cool temperature of food (so, overall will give it 4*)",

    "text": "This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. But that was when I weighed 200 lbs. Now I follow a very low carb diet, and there is not much on the menu for me. The omelette automatically comes with potatoes and a biscuit. They have NO low carb options to substitute for carbs, and the waitress acted like I had asked her for a bar of gold when I asked if they could do sliced tomatoes instead of potatoes. They could not, by the way, because tomatoes aren't in season. Despite the fact that I had told her I cannot have carbs, she offered fruit, which--duh--is carbohydrate too. I expect people who serve food for living to actually know that! They also didn't offer to charge me less for my meal and leave off the carbs, nor did they suggest any other substitutions. Bottom line, if you have special dietary needs, don't bother with this restaurant. It's the only one in the valley that has NOT been helpful in accommodating my diet, and no omelette is worth $10.95 without at least a side of something. The price of the coffee was outrageous as well, $2.75 for plain jane coffee, and not a packet of Splenda on the premises. They also ran out of coffee. Give me Starbuck's any day, for that price! As for atmosphere, we were seated under a tree that kept dropping crap on our table, hair, and food. The waitress forgot to bring the OJ my companion ordered--all the other drinks were self serve buffet style, meaning you got to stand around in a line and wait to serve yourself. Morning Glory is definitely no place I will go again.",

My partner had the brioche french toast and was so content (and he considers himself a french toast connoisseur).

It's a   short walk as there is not right in front but it's cute to see the farm/greenhouse and little open businesses.

I didn't really read a description on this place before going, but I looked on Yelp and saw it had 4 stars and the pictures showed bomb looking food and a cute patio so I went for it.   Because I hadn't read any reviews, I did not realize the restaurant was on The Farm. I had trouble funding the place because there were only signs for The Farm and none for Morning Glory Cafe. Once I stepped on The Farm though I was blown away! Who knew a place so green and country could be found in Phoenix? There were rows of planted veggies and beautiful trees. We turned a corner and saw the quaint little patio nestled under some shady trees.  The hostesses were very nice. It was a long wait. But there was a cute little shop and some local vendors where I bought a few little souvies while we waited. We walked the grounds and had such a relaxing little Sunday.   The food itself was amazing. It took about 45 minutes to come out, and after the 1.5 hour wait for the table we were starving. I got the Back to Your Roots, which was a plate of fresh veggies and potatoes grown right on The Farm! It was incredible! The best meal I've had in months.   In short, plan to spend you're whole morning there unless you get there early. But the food is worth the wait and The Farm is a super cute place to explore.",

I love the ambiance and am so glad we have this little jewel in the Valley.  From the Monte Cristo to the homemade granola and omelets, the food is solid and I think the portions appropriate.   My only complaint about Morning Glory is the self serve drinks. The price should be posted. I am not cheap but would like to know the ice tea will be included for $2.75. After paying my bill, I made sure to stop by and get a refill.",

I got eggs with cheese and I was happy that my food wasn't soggy with oil or over done. The buttermilk biscut was a treat!   The mimosa was a surprise and a bit overpriced. They give you OJ in a glass and a small glass bottle of champ to mix your own. The upside is that one my second one (yeah I roll like that) I just added the extra bottle of champ to my leftover mimosa and the OJ was a little treat for BCBP.   The service is laid back. You get your own coffee and the server will do most of the rest. The guy waiting on us was cool and overall I was happy.  The location is fun. There are chicken you can go and see and it feels like you are tucked away in another place. It doesn't feel like AZ because of all the green.  Just an FYI if you suffer from allergies, when I was there the pollen was raining down. Take your allergy pill beforehand!",

It is very peaceful to eat breakfast under huge trees. It was windy that day which made it a little difficult to keep cups on our table and tree leaves out of our food and drinks. I had coffee which is serve yourself and the chicken enchiladas. These were pretty good. The breakfast is comparable in price to other brunch places. After the meal we walked around and saw the crops being grown and the chickens and turtle. We also did a little shopping at the artsy vendors that they had our front. I would definitely come here again just for the ambiance.",

Plus they have a lot for you to look at, buy, and see as you wait, so that helps. This gorgeous property not only has amazing breakfast, but they cater to many weddings and events. They have fresh produce and homemade goods to buy in their little shop. On some day's they have a little farmers market to come get their freshly picked produce that comes right off of their farms.   But back to the food... I got the special that day. It was their CHILAQUILES: Crisp tortilla with housemade roasted red and tomatillo salsas, two fried eggs, melted cheddar and Monterey Jack, pico de gallo and a drizzle of crema. Topped with shredded pork. The pork was a little sweet yet had a little spice, and was nice and tender. But my favorite part was the housemade roasted red and tomatillo salsas. I need an entire bucket of that so that I can put it on it on EVERYTHING, or drink it... whatever. It was so perfect. Sweet and tangy. Mmmm...   I highly suggest putting this special on your regular menu. If not I hope you they take requests.",

Taylor was our high energy server and she seemed so excited that her words came fast.     The Back to the Roots dish was an amazing medley of yummy veggies with scrambled eggs on top. There were carrots, onions, yellow squash, zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower. This came with O'Brien potatoes and a biscuit.      The All American came with scrambled eggs, thick bacon, and potatoes with a biscuit. I added some serious sausage gravy to make my biscuit perfect.    The ambiance here is unique and enjoyable. To reach this place, turn into a dirt road with a sign for the Farm then drive back as far as you can. There's parking on the left.    It's said that the restaurant will be slammed by 9:30 AM and I can see why.  This is not an inexpensive place but it is the place for good food and a neat environment.",

I had the Farm Burrito with scrambled eggs, refried Arizona tepary beans,potatoes, cheddar cheese and pico de gallo wrapped in a locally made flour tortilla. They serve it with sour cream, salsa, and home fries.   My mouth is watering right now remembering this. It's one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. I didn't bother talking to my breakfast date. I was more interested in the burrito.   It was a dog friendly patio which created for a great ambiance outside on a beautiful Sunday morning.

    "text": "Ughhhhh, what an awful experience. The Farm is beautiful though so five stars for that. The wait was 1 hour and forty minutes. We only waited because we had a cold, Land Lubber visiting from snow country. We sat at the picnic tables soaking op the 97 degree day. Or at least she did. We were hot.   Then, after waiting all that time we were told to get our own drinks.The drinks were self serve, huh? We then waited 40-50 more minutes for our food to be delivered. There were all types of issues with the food. In fact, what they did was a bit unethical in our mind switching ingredients in the special and not telling us or the servers until it hit the table. They did not inform the other wait staff either. We watched other servers taking orders for a dish that they supposedly ran out of it. But the catch was, they did not really run out of it. It was all very confusing and strange. The chef and managers here need to work on their communication skills.   I ordered the Best sandwich and it was not aptly named.  My food was cold. The only reason I did not send it back was because after waiting almost 3 hours I was starving. It was not good at all. It lacked any type of flavor and again it was cold.   We had a lot of other dishes on the table to try.  The biscuits and gravy were also cold. They did bring us a new one on that one. I must say, they are actually pretty good here. After complaining, my two friends finally got their dish after they said they ran out. Still am confused on that. Did they really run out? If so, how did they make it? They did say it was very good.   I gave two stars instead of one because the other dishes were said to be good and the place has really nice ambience. The servers are also nice. It was not their fault. They tried to make up for it and seemed sorry. I think we would have preferred a comp though. ( And I never ask for that.)  All in all, I would never wait almost two hours to eat breakfast ever again and the food is expensive for what we got. I have been wanting to try Quinessence for awhile. I might give that one a try some day but pass on the Morning \"unglorious\" experience.",

It is part of what was once a very large multi acre farm that the Heard family purchased back in the day to study the Arizona canal systems.  It is still a working farm today providing fresh produce, eggs, crafts and best of all........restaurant services.  The breakfast here at the Morning Glory is always very fresh. The herbs and vegetables are grown here,  the coffee is robust yet smooth and iced tea is always refreshing. I have yet to try the morning libations offered but they are on my list. Lol I typically get the smoked trout omelette with egg whites, potatoes and fresh homemade biscuit. (I hand the biscuit over to my bf since it's not gluten free :(( ). The biscuit comes with a side of fresh homemade strawberry preserves which is DELISH!  After a wonderful relaxing scenic breakfast, it's a joy and pleasure to walk around the farm exploring all that is offered.  They provide three restaurants in one location. (breakfast, lunch and dinner) There are also three areas for events including weddings, showers, birthdays and special celebrations.

    "text": "...recently my interview travels would take me to Phoenix/Scottsdale, a place I'd never really considered before, but a place with a job that just seemed \"right\" and a number of fellow gourmands, foodies, and chow-hounds who really reached out with their recommendations and offers to meet up for meals - a great group, each and every one.  With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.  With bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Cafe would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the \"desert.\"  With signs delineating the location of the cafe (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to \"sit anywhere you like.\"  Selecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all \"help yourself\" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.    With the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me \"you'd better be hungry\" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Cafe Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.  Prebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.  With coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the \"Farm Monte Cristo\" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a \"good luck and bon appetite\" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word \"perfect;\" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.  With Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a \"good job\" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich \"wasn't that big, but it was THAT good\" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not \"cheap\" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular.",

We had a \"Mommy Day\" planned (two out of the three are/were pregnant and the day consisted of breakfast, mani/pedis, and finished up with a baby shower.) which started out at MGC.    The second pregnant pal suggested we go to MGC for breakfast and everyone readily agreed.  When we arrived, our orders were taken swiftly.  I must say that they are very accommodating at MGC.  I had asked if I could order hard boiled eggs instead of scrambled/fried for my breakfast and they were more than happy to oblige my breakfast revision.    My only quibble is the fact that we were not aware that you had to pay for the self-serve beverages.  After trying/disliking the lemonade, I went back for ice tea.  Thankfully, I was only charged for one.    Can not wait to go back once MGC opens back up this fall!",

Coffe and tea is also a serve yourself station so that kept me occupied while waiting for food and was a smart move on the owners' part (one less thing for the already busy servers). . Great cafe outdoors. Takes a while for the food to come out but it was packed.  The Cowboy Breakfast Chili & Eggs (AZ Power Ranches Beef, Local Tepary Beans, Melting Cheddar Cheese, Two Over Easy Eggs, Sour Cream, Fresh Cilantro, and Griddled Bread) was really good. I really liked my Spinach and shiitake mushroom omelet as well. The prices weren't too bad either with all things considered.",

    "text": "My family has been going out to Phoenix for spring training for 30 years now, so we've seen a lot of what the city (and surrounding areas) has to offer, and I don't think I'm alone in saying that it gets a little monotonous. Super chains and greasy mom and pop shops permeate the market, and it gets to feeling like the fresh food revolution hasn't really hit the greater Phoenix area yet. But then you stumble across places like the Farm, and you get a little glimmer of hope that you can get a great meal here that doesn't leave you feeling about 20 pounds heavier-- it's possible people! It really is!  The setting itself is not what I've come to expect from Phoenix-- the Farm is lush with trees, has a bit of a funky Santa Fe vibe, and IT'S NOT ALL BROWN. At the end of the long driveway is Morning Glory Cafe, set amongst flower beds and underneath tall trees. It did seem to be all outdoor seating.   We were seated immediately and our attentive server took our drink orders (two mimosas, obviously), and we both ordered the eggs benedict on the recommendation of our waiter, who said the hollandaise sauce was particularly good that day. And it was! The dishes had just the right amount of it, and left you feeling full without leaving you ready to burst. Well cooked and well executed.   I definitely recommend this restaurant for a change of pace, and a breath of fresh air!",

    "text": "After hitting up the downtown farmers market this past Saturday, the Hubs and I decided to give the Farm at South Mountain a try, since we are rarely in this area.  Although we were a bit confused on which restaurant was which, we ended up landing at the Morning Glory Cafe.  I must add, as other reviewers have noted, the scenery here is wonderful and unique.  That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.  I found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.  I liked the self serve lemonade/tea/coffee, although non were anything to write home about.  So, if you're in the area and want to experience something different, I say why not try Morning Glory Cafe.  For me, next time I will try the deli/grill place at the front.  I love the idea of a picnic here on a beautiful spring or fall day.  Can't beat that!",

The granola was so incredible, I had to buy some to go. My kids had the French Toast (yum) and waffles, which they devoured.y husband had bacon & eggs & said it was great.  We ate outdoors, and afterwards we went into the cute gift shop, toured the gardens and visited the farmer's market.  Possibly  the most perfect morning ever.  Thanks, Morning Glory!",

We had a slight wait on the Sunday morning that we went, which we didn't mind at all because of the lovely scenery at The Farm @ South Mountain. It definitely makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert. We were seated at a 4-top, even though we were only a party of 2. It was nice to have the extra room! I got the American Breakfast, which included 2 scrambled eggs, home fries, applewood smoked bacon and a DELICIOUS biscuit that we had to order 2 more of, they were that good!  My husband had the local Schreiner's sausage, tomato and cheese omelette, which he really enjoyed, but I think he could have easily eaten a slightly larger portion. The food was really great! We had a really sweet server as well. The only complaint I have is that they had what looked like an all-you-can-drink beverage bar, where they were serving lemonade, tea and water from big canteens in plastic cups. Of course, we grabbed 2 drinks thinking \"Oh, how nice!\" Unfortunately, both drinks turned up on our tab. I would have appreciated someone warning us that they charge for the drink bar. But, that's OK. Now I am more informed and I would definitely come back here!",

The grounds are gorgeous and shady, and include an entire farm and green house in which to walk off your meal, and the food was fantastic.   I had the All American Breakfast, which included a perfect sized serving of bacon, two eggs, a biscuit and hash browns. Everything was how you would want it to be - the bacon crisp, the biscuits soft and buttery, the eggs fresh and cooked to order.   My one complaint was the bloody mary, which was WAY too spicy. I'm not one to send a drink back, but it was ruining the meal because it was creating a reaction in my throat with each sip. I flagged down the waitress and asked to add more tomato juice to it to even it out (and she seemed to know what I was going to request before I said, leading me to believe this happens a lot and that they should reconsider their bloody mary mix recipe). But she was more than happy to correct it ... except that they had run out of tomato juice. I left the drink where she placed it back on the table, hoping I wouldn't have to ask to have it removed from the bill.   Smartly, when she came to drop off the check, she asked if we were done and if I wanted the drink. I said no, she then handed us the appropriate ticket. She had the smarts to print one with the drink on it and one without so she would be prepared for either answer, eliminating any awkwardness or time wasting by going back to re-print it. Seriously, it's that kind of simple act of foresight that makes me love a venue's service.  Oh, and they have wi-fi but I couldn't get my phone to pick up the network.",

    "text": "This is a cute spot! It is a bit out of the way next to South Mountain, but the rural farmy setting definitely benefits from that.   You enter by going up a long farm lane, passing between several buildings, an event lawn, a group doing yoga on the other lawn, etc. It is very picturesque and seems like a good place for a wedding or other party. There are several buildings at the end of the lane and Morning Glory Cafe occupies the patio of one of those buildings - you duck beneath a vine-covered arbor and enter the seating area. The tables are patio tables covered with plastic red gingham patterned tablecloths with menus scattered on them. You choose your own table and are advised to help yourself to coffee, iced tea, lemonade, water at the station next to the house. You can also order a few other beverages from your server - orange juice, mimosas, bloody marys, etc.   The menu is relatively brief but chock full of farm fresh ingredients. They have some interesting items - The Cowboy Breakfast Chili and Eggs, The Farm Monte Cristo, and the Chicken Enchiladas were all pretty unique breakfast fare and so we ordered one of each :) Browsing the menu, I learned that if you are a pancake/waffle/french toast/pastry lover, this is not the place for you. The food came out REALLY fast, which makes me think that they have most of the stuff ready to go in the kitchen and just garnish/sauce the dishes before sending them out. Itwas pretty good - I got the Chicken Enchiladas, which were filled with shredded chicken, covered with green chile sauce, and topped with Over Easy eggs. The temperature of the dish was less than great (a bit cold) and the yolks of my eggs were overdone, cooked all the way through. When I've had dishes like this before, the intention is that the yolks are runny and add moisture and flavor to the dish beneath. Since the eggs were overcooked, this didn't happen and it left the rest of the dish pretty dry (most of the green chile sauce was soaked into the enchiladas beneath) I did ask for extra chile sauce which was provided promptly, however it was very cold and did not spread well over the dish (I also could have still used even more of it, as the dish was SO dry)   We had a side of bacon that was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the Cowboy Breakfast Chili.   The setting was nice - we could hear roosters crowing and watch the activities of the farm/preparation for the day's events, etc. while we ate.  Service was decent - the girl who was our server was nice but a little brief - I was having trouble deciding and asked her for her favorite item on the menu. She said the Chicken Enchiladas but didn't really elaborate further, which didn't sell me on it. Her demeanor just came across as pretty uninterested.  I felt like the prices were quite high considering the type of place (outdoor picnic tables), service (serve yourself for the key stuff and overall a little less than friendly) and food (seemingly mass made, okay tasting, not quite right) We spent $60 for three people and I walked away just really feeling as though it wasn't worth $20 per person.  I did want to like Morning Glory Cafe, but in the end it was more of a \"meh\" meal.",

I highly recommend the Monte Cristo, it is definitely the best item on the menu. Just a heads up, there is parking right in front of the restaurant. It seems confusing because there are signs by the street directing you to a dirt lot across from the property.",

    "text": "What a waste. Place looks like a cool spot for breakfast, but that was it. There were about 4 tables, and 2 waitresses, and they waited like 15+ minutes before even asking us if we wanted a menu. They did however stare at us several times, yet never making the jump to offer us anything. After we took a menu from the table next to us that finished, we finally got to order. Once the food came, it took another 5 minutes to get silverware. Non-fresh squeezed OJ(Big letdown!), and food was terrible. I had the breakfast burrito and my tortilla shell was stale. My sisters goat cheese omelet was rancid, and my other sisters scrambled eggs had a very weird taste to them(unedible). Only meal that didn't get too many complaints was the over easy eggs, except the yolk was cooked.   The weird thing was that the neighboring table's food looked so much better than ours. I don't understand, because we werent raudy or disrespectful or anything. We paid our bill, and left, and will never be back. Shame, because of the cool setting. Don't waste your money on overpriced breakfast!",

    "text": "A good friend once said that everything tastes good with truffle oil.  I couldn't agree more, and that's just one of the reasons I love the Morning Glory Cafe.  Let's start with ambience.  It's an outdoor patio, with trees providing the shade.  It's morning on a farm, so the cock will crow every now and then.  Birds actually sing.  And it's Phoenix, so the weather is going to be perfect 99% of the time.  The coffee (serve yourself!) is a decent blend.  But the highlight of the breakfast was the veggie skillet - farm fresh vegetables done in a skillet (this mornings selection included fennel, squash and red onion), together with skillet potatoes, and topped with scrambled eggs finished with white truffle oil.  I know - it makes me salivate just thinking about it.  And that's what makes a good restaurant.",

    "text": "I have loved Morning Glory cafe for YEARS. The grounds are beautiful and while I've eaten at all three of the restaurants at the Farm I love the Morning Glory Cafe most of all because I can sit in the grass nearby while I wait for a table to become available (yes, there will be a wait, especially on weekends) and I feel like I'm not in the dusty Arizona desert anymore.   I've also come to MGC for Mother's Day for two of the past three years and it's almost become a tradition for me and my daughter. However, this last Mother's Day really (really) disappointed me.   When I arrived we were told there was an hour wait. OK... No problem. I was expecting that (at least) and any other decent place would have a similar wait on Mother's Day. However, the issue was bigger than just the hour wait - the hostess who was calling people's names off the waiting list had such a faint voice that I couldn't hear her call my name - even though we were sitting right in front of her and I had gone up to ask her 10minutes prior if our table was ready. (You would think she would recognize me if I had just gone to talk to her and was sitting right in front of her but she seemed either clueless or overwhelmed).  As a result - we were passed up and FOUR other tables were seated before us. After figuring out we had been passed up I went back again and asked if our table was ready and the hostess didn't even apologize. I'm sorry but when you have over 50 people waiting at a time for their table, you can't put someone with the voice of a 9 year old in charge of calling names. I understand it's a farm and a loudspeaker would kill the ambiance but at least get a better system in place for making sure people get seated after they've waited so long for a table.   Finally we were seated, and drinks were self serve so we immediately got water/coffee. The wait staff was completely frazzled at this point in the morning. They were stopping at tables for no longer than 2min at a time and making beelines between tables and the kitchen so you couldn't even get their attention without causing a scene.   We ordered a good 15min after being seated even though we knew exactly what we wanted to order. An HOUR later we still didn't have our food and my 5 year old daughter (who normally has to be bribed to eat) started crying. I asked her what was the matter and she said \"I'm so hungry!\" Not exactly the kind of thing a mom wants to be dealing with on Mother's Day. It was so sad the table next to us started offering us food off of their plates to give to my daughter (how embarrassing).  The waitress walked by a few times and I said \"Is our food almost ready? We've been waiting over an hour.\" Her response was \"Yeah, so has everyone else\" and walked away.   Finally I called our waitress back and I said \"We ordered a cup of fruit. Can you at least bring that? My daughter needs to eat something.\" She came back with the fruit cup which my daughter inhaled and about 15min later we had our actual breakfasts (which were very good and well-made as always. Food never disappoints here).  I will say, that to \"make up\" for the wait, they gave us a complimentary dessert which was a nice gesture in the end but the whole experience has made me question whether I will go back for any special occasions.   Reason being - I've noticed the Farm grow in popularity over the years but there hasn't been any real improvements to their service. They still run the place as though they are getting the same amount of traffic as 5 years ago and that is obviously not the case anymore.   They could have done a better of job of getting us seated at the right time - or of getting a snack for my daughter if they knew the main breakfast was going to take longer than normal - or of telling us when we put our name on the list: \"it's an hour wait for a table and another hour wait for food to be served\" - so we could make a better decision as to whether we should stick around.   They need to find a way to keep it low key and quaint without putting people through the kind of experience we went through. Maybe a reservation system is needed for breakfast? Limit the number of guests? Idk, but they certainly shouldn't just leave people to wait over 2.5 hours to have their first meal of the day - especially when the majority of patrons in the mornings are families with young kids.   Again, isolated incident, but can't say that their seating system or wait staff are any more organized on other days of the year. Wait times for a table can be up to 30-45min on any weekend but normally food does NOT take over an hour to arrive.   Note: they have a separate Mother's Day brunch that you can purchase advance tickets for, and those have scheduled seating times. I have never taken that option because my daughter typically doesn't eat a lot and it would be a huge waste.",

There's an organic farm on the property and the tea and lemonade are self serve. The only main issue is that Arizona is hot and everything is outdoors. In addition there were lots of flies so everyone was swatting them with their menu. At the same time, people willing to overcome both of those issues must love the spot. Very cute. Would definitely recommend it to anyone near the airport!",

An absolute must if the weather is mild and you can get there early.  A bit later it gets too busy and limited number of tables can cause a wait.  Kids loved the self-serve beverages and we loved the flavor and local flair  Only reason it wasn't a five star was the amount of 'nature' that ended up in my coffee...lots of grass and seeds from the overhanging trees.  Guess I should have had a lid on my coffee  Dog friendly and very laid back vibe.  We will probably stop I on our way to airport, making it our only Phoenix repeat during our short stay",

This place could be 5 stars if the staff wasn't so lax and a little more attentive. This was the whole table (8 ladies) first time coming to this place, we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics (water, coffee, juice) we had to figure that out on our own, and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any other drink other then the self serve stuff.

The food was excellent! We shared the cowboy eggs (or something like that) and the french toast. The cowboy dish was amazing, it is a big bowl of delicious, well seasoned, slightly spicy chili with two over easy eggs on top and two pieces of toasted and buttery bread. I thought it was a real gem. The french toast was also very very good. I am not super into sweet breakfast, but I might make an exception for this. The toast had a crispy outside and a soft inside, was covered in syrup and some kind of flavored butter, and topped with nuts...it was crazy good....I only deducted a star because it was my first time coming there and the place is a bit expensive, but there is no question I would come back here again. In fact....I want to go back right now!  Oh, Tip: I saw the parking lot across the street from the farm and parked there BUT it is a long walk from there to the restaurant and there is closer parking...just not a ton of it.",

Self serve drinks, all outdoor seating and a casual, fresh-aired, relaxing environment. We got seated immediately before the church rush, grabbed hot coffee and soaked up the morning sun. I ordered their farm omelette after battling and eyeing up the brioche French toast. The omelette had broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, spinach and cheese covered with fresh tomato salsa. The salsa had a nice spicy after taste and the omelette was so thick and well made. Their biscuits are flaky, buttery and delicious with a slice of grapefruit to add a little tang. This also Come with seasoned breakfast potatoes. My brunch date got the \"pork is the new black\" omelette and was on food cloud nine with the sausage gravy over the top.

Although it was very warm by the time my friends and I finished our breakfast, which we began at 9:30am, it was a great eating experience. Granola with fruit, French toast, corn porridge and my omelet were all enjoyed! Looking forward to going back another time when it gets cooler weather there in the Phoenix countryside, or as close to that as we can get and still just be a few short miles from the city. It is a pet-friendly place. Tables set aside for people wanting to sit with their dog and enjoy their meal. Cool! We must have it hit lucky as we got the last open table when we arrived at 9:30. The man who runs the greenhouse is a fountain of knowledge and will explain exactly what to do with the plant you buy so that it lives a long life, so be sure to check that out, along with walking the property. Just enjoy the outdoors and you will swear you are not even in the Phoenix desert.!",

Have spent Mother's day here @ Morning Glory (not separate buffet) for a few years and like to take friends here when in town or when we want a relaxed, filling, outdoors brunch. Great service and scenery! I would like to say all food is good but I can't pry myself away from the Monte Cristo French Toast to try anything else-- delish! Highly recommend.",

The reason for 2 stars is that management didn't know where the Chicken comes from. Out of principle, I can't support a restaurant when there's a lack of knowledge for the source of the meat.  It was also my impression that one of the staff members and managers was laughing at the fact that I was asking this question.  Strictly speaking about the food, the huevos rancheros was uneventful and my omelette was dry and Seemed as if had been sitting for a while when It reached the table.  I'd happily be back if the restaurant could dial-in this one particular piece of their business.  As of all all of us vote with our dollars, I feel it's so important that we make decisions to support restaurants that have great practices in place.",

There was breeze and I think it was because of the trees and grass. It really is a beautiful place to sit down and relax.  The food was SUPER delicious! I had the green enchiladas with egg and potatoes on the side. Every bite was better than the next! My friend had the farm omelette with egg whites and I had a taste as well. The taste was fresh and the goat cheese gave it that extra yum flavor. I also had a mimosa that was good, but a little overpriced for the size and there was nothing special about it. They also have a self serve station for water, tea, and coffee which I thought was a cute unique touch to the restaurant.   Another plus was the customer service super friendly people. I will be back for sure to try one of their many other menu items.",

I got three bites into the chilaquiles, and was bored from then on. Two bites for the biscuits and gravy. Way too pricey. I might give this place another star if the prices were lower, but I don't pay these prices for that lack of flavor.  We waited more than an hour on a Saturday morning to be seated. It's on a gorgeous farm with plenty to see and do during the wait, just don't expect to walk up and sit down. Only outdoor seating available, so if you have allergies or an aversion to bird droppings plopping down next to you as you eat, be forewarned.",

We had already waited over 40 mins for our food to begin with, it was a large party so that was understandable. When I asked about my plate, it looked as though the waiter, Fausto R., had forgotten. Everyone in my party was almost done when my plate came, to my surprise my order was made incorrectly. I ordered the chilaquiles with over hard eggs but got scrambled.  The waiter said he would bring over hard eggs which took 12 minutes. Eggs do not take that long to cook. By the time i got the eggs the chilaquiles were soggy. I really thought he would at least apologize and give me some sort of reason but he didn't. When the bill came I really thought there would be some sort of apology and discount on my plate but there was not. So I requested that my plate be discounted off, he was not happy about that. My dad was eating my leftovers, so he said he couldn't take it off especially since we were still eating the plate, but would still bring it to his bosses attention and just walked away.  It took another 15 minutes for him to come back. The food was good and I love the setting but Fausto made the experience horrible. My brothers and I were there with my parents bc my moms father passed away and we were just trying to be together. It sucks that someone's attitude can ruin an experience.",

Granted, there was a pretty long wait time but the weather was nice enough for us to walk around The Farm and take some pictures and see everything. From their gift shop with locally sourced items to their sustainable garden and greenhouse it was a treat to be able to see. Once we were sat to eat the servers were patient and kind despite the heavy traffic they had seen all day. There was an array of food to choose from that made it hard to pick, but our family of four all got different things and no one was disappointed! For those 21 and over they served seasonal mimosas as well. Overall, a wonderful brunch with a wonderful atmosphere. While my experience was 5/5, one thing to keep in mind is that it only has outdoor seating, making an iffy place for the summer. There was lots of shade but I am unsure how hot it would get in the AZ heat!",

Enough food so I didn't leave hungry, but not enough to where I had to find a fridge for my leftovers while at work. Just the perfect amount, I felt like Goldilocks right there! Haha!  I ordered the veggie omelette, they use seasonal veggies, this was onion, yellow squash and zucchini. The best treat of all was the goat cheese. I had forgotten after I placed my order that it had goat cheese, which is one of the reasons I ordered it. It was such a nice surprise! So much more savory than cheddar! The house potatoes were also delicious, simple and delicious! This was a such a pleasant place to go for my 37th birthday breakfast!",

Seating is all outside under large beautiful trees, lovely breeze this morning too, it was one of the most relaxing areas I've ever experienced and it was hard to believe that I was still in the city of Phoenix.   We were seated within 10 minutes and our server Carrie was great with answers to any questions we even brought us a menu from the restaurant adjacent Quiesscence and answered questions we had about that restaurant.   Now the food.  I had the chef special which was a braised beef and carmeralized onion omelette with potatoes.   My sister had the Eggs Benedict with the potatoes and of course, being family, we shared.  Everything was delicious and fresh.   After we ate we wandered around the farm and came across a small crowd and we were informed that the goat had two kids yesterday.   Just watching them brought a big grin to my face.   Next to the goat pen was the chicken pen.     It was just a lovely morning.",

As such, I only go to places either very early in the day or on weekdays to avoid being frustrated as some posters have mentioned.  The crowds mentioned speak to the greatness of this place in my opinion.  Will go again in a couple of weeks with other guests.  Can't wait!",

It is 4 stars just because the service is getting a little weak.  I used feel like the people there were tip top, but this last visit they seemed to resting on their fact that everyone loves the setting.  They turned down the customer service thinking I wouldn't notice.    It is True, I did barely notice it, since I happen to be in love.  However, when you have a great server this place makes you feel like, you're dining in Oprah Winfreys' backyard during a big hat party!  Shimmering leaves, mimosas, amidst a organic garden, birds chirping, while couples in love and children frolic on the almond orchard horizon.    This place is great!  I feel like giving it 5 stars again now that I think about my times there.  This setting is so damn good.  I have to drive 15 miles to get here, and it is worth it.  However, I am going to keep it a 4 stars.  If I update, I am sure i will write this one a 5 star again",

    "text": "The Morning Glory Cafe is located at the far end of a very long drive through some really nice land at The Farm at South Mountain.  The area really takes you out of the city and makes you think there might not be civilization beyond the tall trees surrounding it.  It is a peaceful oasis in the midst of a bustling metropolis.  One note to save you some walking - as we approached the are on 32nd Street, there was a sign pointing right that said \"Morning Glory Cafe\" and a sign pointing left that said \"Parking.\"  We turned left, parked, and walked down the long drive to the restaurant...where we found parking available for the restaurant.  Don't get tricked by the parking sign and park in the little lot across the street.  You can go down the drive and park closer to the restaurant itself.  The restaurant was fine overall; nothing terrible to talk about, but nothing amazing to talk about either.   The restaurant is outdoor seating only; there is no interior dining room so if you don't like to sit outside this probably isn't the best place for you.   One issue I encountered while we were there was that the trees (which there are a lot of all over) were dropping little leaves on us whenever the wind blew and they would land on our food.  The food itself was just okay.  It came out REALLY fast (and the restaurant was not slow that morning) which means that most of the food is prepped and ready to be nuked and served.  I had the \"Cowboy Breakfast - Chili and Eggs\" and it was a bowl of chili with two over-easy eggs on top.  Nothing fancy, just that.  Definitely not a lot of thought toward presentation or elegance - and, I get it, I ordered the Cowboy breakfast on a farm I shouldn't expect French Laundry... but, based on that dish and my overall experience, I don't think I'll be going back and if I did I wouldn't order the Cowboy Breakfast again.  There just wasn't anything interesting or special about it.  It really struck me as a turn-and-burn dish.  The beverage setup was a little strange, but I actually didn't totally mind it.  Coffee, tea, water, and lemonade are self serve up at the counter and the server just counts your cups at the end of the meal.  One positive to being able to fill my own drink was that it was never empty because I didn't need to wait for our server to stop by the table for refills.  Speaking of servers, we didn't end up leaving that much of a tip because when you arrive, you find your own table and you get your own drinks.  The server stopped by the take our order and dropped off our food.  Other than that, we didn't see her until she brought the check over.  Honestly, I did half of the work myself by getting my drinks so we didn't feel like a large (or even normal) tip was necessary.  Overall, Morning Glory Cafe was alright, but I have better restaurants to spend my time in.",

The little biscuits and home-fries served with it were delicious too!   My boyfriend had the chicken enchilada and loved it.   Our only criticism would be for the drinks. He had a Bloody Mary. The drinks were premade so they could not customize. He said there was too much pepper and not enough Worcestershire.   They don't serve any pop either. Pop is my caffeine fix of choice so that was a bit of a bummer.   Service was good and it was fun to walk around the property while we waited for our table.",

I booted up my trusty Yelp App, and a quick search yielded this place a mere 30 second drive away.  This is just an awesome brunch spot.  A lot of the ingredients seemed very fresh and delicious.  I got the breakfast burritos which came loaded with rich, delicious chorizo, eggs, and beans, while my girlfriend got the waffles.  The waffles came with the sweetest blackberries I've ever eaten (although the strawberries were not sweet).  Love the atmosphere, service, and the food.

It is all outdoor seating which was nice.  There were outdoor heaters set up so it wasn't cold.   Everything is suppose to be organic, which I'm sure it was.  I can't tell the difference from real food and organic, I just like what taste good.  The food did taste good, but it wasn't anything special for me.     I had the American breakfast.  Bacon tasted like bacon should.  Same with the eggs.  Came with baked potatoes which were ok, kind of bland.  There was no salt or pepper on the table.   The wife had a monte Cristo.  That was good.  It used their French toast which by itself was good and as a sandwich was good.  You can't go wrong with that.",

Sooooo I got the following:  French Toast (Sweet Rustic Bread, Apple Butter, Candied Pecans and Warm Syrup)  + Side of 1 egg and a side of applewood smoked Bacon (3 Slices)   The french toast came out with 3 THICK slices of bread, a TON of apple butter and a sprinkling of pecans. While the bread was fresh and soft... it didnt really have much flavor... I like my french toast to be more cinnamony... Plus, there was just TOO MUCH butter and not enough pecans.  The bacon was MONEY!! It was peppered (which I LOVE) and cooked perfectly.   My friend got the blueberry Belgian waffle which she swapped 1/2 for 1/2 of my french toast.  The waffle was probably the best thing there.... light and fluffy with WHOLE blueberries in it... YUM.  Also, my other friend's meal came with a biscuit and \"home fries\" which she let me try. The biscuit was warm and fresh out of the oven but a bit too dense for my taste... the \"home fries\" are actually just seasoned and slightly mashed up potatoes... they were REALLY good... spicy and very flavorful. I wish I had ordered some!!   I also got a glass of fresh squeeze orange juice. DELICIOUS!!!   The food here is great, but what really makes this place a hit is the ambiance... the little tables under the shade of the trees and the farmy, rustic feel.   GO HERE!!",

While sitting in the cafe or garden waiting to be seated (it can be a while) the sounds of bird song fills the air and enticing aromas from the kitchen flow by teasing your nose and creating thoughts on what culinary delights will soon be filling your belly.    The service has always been exceptional and the servers will always make sure you have a good experience.  One person that stands out in my mind as an example of how to keep things running smoothly is Cliff, he is the best!  He keeps the place cruising along at an unhurried, yet efficient pace with a calmness that is at the core of the experience The Farm offers.    Give it a try if you haven't and keep coming back if you have.  This place is great for biking, bringing your well behaved dogs and just spending some quality time with family or friends.",

    "text": "It is indeed wise to close the patio for the summer, but we will be back when Morning Glory reopens in September to see if we can nudge this 3-star review any higher.   When you set foot in the Farm at South Mountain, you just want to love the place. It is an active farm with gardeners tending to the rows of flowers and vegetables, a magnificent walk to the patio and shops, and my personal favorite, the chicken coop! Lots of chickens scurrying about and bickering with each other.   From time to time you will also notice social events and outdoorsy activities (such as yoga classes, musical recitals, etc.) taking place on the expansive lawn. The grounds are enormous; perfect for a light stroll after you've had your breakfast. Fitting then for this farm to present Morning Glory Cafe, with its exclusively outdoor seating and colorful view of the garden.   The first time I visited (Sept. 2017), I think I was so mesmerized by the plants that I forgot to give much consideration to the food! My meal was undoubtedly good though, so I left with the sole intention to return.   Since coming back, and these times with more and more company, a few things have shifted into focus:   With my respects to Cortez coffee, it is not worth ~$3 to make however many trips you need to the beverage station. In fact, I do not much like that setup at all. A line often accumulates, drinks do run out, and if not, you are likely to dispense old coffee that's been sloshing around for whatever length of time.   Given the proud farm-to-table vittles, the \"local sausage\" initially struck me as a must-try; you can get it as a side to your American Breakfast (classic eggs + meat combo), an omelet add-in, or a standalone plate. But oh my, how very dry.... the ~$4 for our sausage became a table centerpiece, as enduring the dry chewiness was not worth the effort.  These complaints out of the way, it ought to be noted that they do vegetables well over here, and are we really surprised by that? The fresh vegetable medleys add nicely to any dish, and while we're at it, the eggs and toast are good too.   In all, Morning Glory is A-OK; you get breakfast with your scenery (or scenery with your breakfast; depends on your outlook). I do recommend them, but on the same note, I would strongly recommend having coffee before or after breakfast, and order the bacon too. If the weather is agreeable, do take in the garden after your meal. If nothing else, that is sure to be a relaxing and enjoyable experience.   Til September, Morning Glory.",

It's the weekend! Enjoy a slow day and the scenery. The farm is beautiful. The gift shop is sweet. Homer the tortoise and his chicken friends are always excited to have friends say hi while you wait for your name to be called. There are plenty of places to sit and relax until it's your turn to dine. The service in the cafe is FAST! The food is fresh and delicious. I can never pass up some fresh OJ. So go here on a leisurely day and relax. Then stop by the bistro up front on your way out for something sweet.",

Driving through beautiful green pastures to find Morning Glory gave me FOMO for all the other eateries I wouldn't have time to visit in one trip. And I regret not bringing my husky puppy to AZ with me.  At Morning Glory, coffee is self-served, but a waitress comes by to take your food order. I got the classic eggs benedict because it's a pretty good benchmark for brunch places. I wish I wasn't going straight to work right after because the Bloody Mary looked delicious.  The eggs benedict was tasty, and my friend loved her dish too. Everything is so lush and Pinterest-worthy, from the food to the decor. It was surprisingly empty for a popular weekend brunch time, which was good for us. I like that the benches are squished together, leaving plenty of room for large groups and their animal companions.  Overall I'm happy with my experience at Morning Glory. Usually I don't like to repeat eateries when I'm traveling, but I'd be down to come here again. AZ always surprises me with its incredible food and amazing sights. This place is no exception.",

    "text": "I had a weird experience at Morning Glory Cafe recently. The farm is normally such a pretty and peaceful place. However, on this Saturday morning, we were sat next to a very rowdy table. They were clearly drunk when we arrived. They had finished their meals but were continuing to drink. They were so loud. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore and asked to be moved. I explained to the server, who was also their server, that they were too noisy and intoxicated. She was very kind about moving us. Our new table was still within view, but much quieter. Unfortunately, this story doesn't end there. They ordered at least three more rounds of mimosas and continued to drink until one of them puked all over the table. What a pretty sight for breakfast...  I would like to chalk this experience up to bad guests, but the server was just as much at fault. They had been clearly over-served long before the vomit.  Also, the food was bland and lacked any sort of flavor. My friend and I both ordered from the \"South of the Border\" section of the menu but we had to douse our food in hot sauce to make it taste like anything that would be close to Mexican food.",

My friend and I hiked a trail on South Mountain last weekend and wanted to find a place to eat brunch afterwards and stumbled upon this place. Beware, this restaurant is very very busy (at least on weekends, which was when we visited). We waited over an hour to be seated, but in my opinion, it was worth the wait. There is a lot to do around the restaurant: a big area to walk around and chairs/tables outside to sit and chat at.  The food was also delicious and the portions were generous. I ordered the farm burrito and my friend ordered the farm monte cristo. I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito and the salsa was the perfect complement. My friend enjoyed her meal as well, but said that it was a little heavy for her tastes. If you're looking for a cute place for brunch that serves good food and has great service, this is a great place to check out!",

    "text": "We went for brunch on Saturday as a group of eight (plus my Corgi), and I was delighted with my entire experience. They don't take reservations, and when we got there we were told the wait would be an hour. For a Saturday morning I wasn't surprised, I feel like you'd have a hard time finding a brunch place with a shorter wait in most parts of the Valley. Luckily, since we were such a large group there were only so many tables that could accommodate us and one opened up within 15 minutes!   In the 15 minutes we waited we grabbed coffee from the coffee cart and mimosas from the hostess table, listened to the live music, explored the gardens, and checked out the local businesses that had booths. We even got to watch weddings get set up and one happen!   They were busy but our orders were taken quickly and our food brought out in record time. Our waitress seemed spread thin, so it was hard to get the one set of silverware we were missing, but it all happened in time. The food was great, everyone in our group loved what they ordered. It's hard to beat fresh ingredients that come straight from the farm that surrounds you as you eat. If you're going with a group, take note that there's no splitting of checks, but thank goodness for Venmo!   There are giant shade trees that kept us cool in the beautiful April weather, and the entire place had such a relaxed and happy environment. I would've loved to hang out there all day.  I had heard people talk about the Farm at South Mountain for years while I lived in the Valley, and am so glad I finally went!",

I love the atmosphere of The Farm at South Mountain but had always eaten at The Kitchen so it was on my checklist to try out this breakfast spot.  I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo. It was a huge portion, filled with fluffy eggs, potatoes, chorizo, refried tepary beans, cheese and pico de gallo. All the components worked well together, and while I enjoyed the addition of chorizo, I'd probably skip it for next time since it was an additional $2.50 on top of my already pricey $12.95 burrito. The plate also had sour cream, mild salsa, potatoes, and a slice of grapefruit.   We brought the pups along since it's a dog friendly venue. They enjoyed hanging out and taking in all the sights at the farm. They have some mega chickens here that are larger than my dogs. Tricki was very intrigued!",

I had the \"B.E.S.T\" Breakfast sandwich which consisted of Toasted sandwich with applewood smoked bacon, Hickman Farm eggs (any style), spinach, tomato, Gruyere cheese and mayo. Served with Farm home fries.  The sandwich was actually quite bland and I decided to switch with my husband who ordered the Chilaquiles which consisted of Crisp tortillas with housemade roasted red and tomatillo salsas, two fried eggs, melted cheese, pico de gallo and crema.  I took a bite of that and didn't like it either so I went back to my sandwich.  My parents split a chorizo burrito and that was quite tasty.  If I ever come back, that is what I would order.  The 'serve yourself' drink area was a little deceiving as there is a tiny sign hanging above the area that stated the drinks were $3.25 (free refills).  They don't mention this when they tell you that you can help yourself to tea, coffee, water and lemonade at the beginning when you are seated.  I didn't realize that until the very end when we received our bill.  My toddler didn't drink anything from there as we brought his own milk and juice bottles but he was charged anyway.  Again, the atmosphere was great and my kids enjoyed running around afterwards.",

    "text": "What a unique and scenic place to dine in Phoenix! Definitely not your typical Arizona desert landscape. I've been here twice now and I think it will be a go-to spot, in the non-summer months, to bring out-of-state guests. Reminds me of a Cali vineyard - so I think it's kind of cool to show visitors that places like this exist here in the Valley.  The first time you come here it can be a bit tricky to find because you have to pull in and drive all the way back the the dirt road to the gravel parking lot. Once you park, you can walk down to the cafe. The cafe has all outdoor seating so don't expect AC or any other indoor accommodations. I've never used their restrooms so I'm not sure what they are like or even where they are located. They do have lots of shaded tables but it still gets hot so I really recommend coming as early as possible. On my most recent visit, we arrived at 9:30am and by the time we left around 10:30/11am it was already pretty hot! (It's May.) Because of this, their hours of operation are very limited and they close early (11am on weekdays and 1pm on weekends).  Delicious sweet and savory breakfast options. Talk about fresh, this is legit farm to table dining as I believe they even get their eggs from the chicken coop which you have a direct view of at your table. You can even walk over and check out the coop if you so desire (I haven't yet).  Self serve water, coffee, juice in coolers at a little station. In terms of the food, I've only tried savory items but next time I plan to splurge and try one of their sweet dishes.  Both times I've dined here early on a weekday so it wasn't busy and there was no wait. I've heard it gets busy on weekends. The service was pretty good but also not super speedy either time. I think this is the kind of place you're expected to sit, chill, enjoy the scenery, and maybe leisurely catch up with someone. Not a place to come if you're in a rush.  It says it's child friendly but I'd be reluctant to bring my toddler: a.) because of the sun and heat; and b.) because I can almost guarantee they'd want to run through the garden and fields - which is probably ok with management (?) but would most definitely result in a dirt fest. Then again, I am reluctant to dine out with my toddler just about anywhere!  I dream of hosting (or at the very least attending) an event here on The Farm at South Mountain's gorgeous grounds. I'm going to go ahead and add that to my bucket list!   Come here if you want to escape the desert and experience a unique farm to table breakfast.",

    "text": "If I was rating the food alone, I would give them 4 stars. But unfortunately the service we experienced was horrible.   I ordered the smoked trout board and subbed roasted veggies instead of the bagel. My dish was wonderful and I'd highly recommend it.   The service, however, will keep me from returning.   We expected to wait before we arrived, so that was no surprise. We had a party of 6 and a baby, which is already difficult with a restaurant that doesn't take reservations, and Morning Glory tends to run long wait times. We made the best of it and enjoyed some mimosas while wandering around the grounds and enjoying each other's company.   They gave away the first table to a group who had been waiting for less time than us. Once we got to our table, it felt like we were an afterthought to our server. She rarely checked on us and didn't seem to care about our experience. The food took a very long time to come out, some of which didn't actually ever come out, and then our bill took over a half hour. They tacked on automatic 20% gratuity, which we felt was a bit absurd considering our experience  If you're thinking of coming here for brunch, consider going elsewhere or just ordering takeout instead.",

I did feel like they put a tad bit too much syrup, next time I will ask for it on the side. Other than that the food was amazing. The waiter we had encouraged us to explore the farm which was really cool. They have pet chickens for adoptions and a big tortoise!

The lemonade and ice tea options are awful, don't waste your time on the free refills for $3.50. The drinks to order was also around the same price, but much better. We ordered OJ and Cranberry Juice. Eggs Benedict and Trout omelet. Both came with home potatoes which were good and a biscuit. Jam was real strawberries. Yum!  I gave a 4 star because I ordered the peppers to the side but they didn't even deliver those and the waitress was gone so long by time she came I had already eaten much of my meal. She didn't even offer to bring then, even at that time, which seemed rude since they come with the meal.   Good place to eat, just a few service items could improve.",

My boyfriend had eggs benedict and he said the sauce was the best he has ever had - very rich.  He said the sauteed greens on the benedict was a nice touch.  It's very casual and it was packed.  I definitely want to try the dinner restaurant, Quintessa?   It is expensive but would be such a great experience.  They said he butchers his own meat and flies in fresh seafood every day.   Yummy!",

    "text": "I really struggled between 3 and 4 stars for this. The farm is awesome and it was a perfect day. We came here for a baby shower/brunch and were able to sit in the back on the grass. Everyone was excited we got some sun and were able to sit outside in February with such great weather.   We recognized the restaurant was busy, and no one was in a rush, but it seemed like our waitress couldn't handle the stress of brunch as well as having a larger party. I know I can be pretty harsh when it comes to serving, but when you spend over 10 years doing it yourself, you know how things could and should be done.  We had the menu in front of us for not even a minute and she was asking what we wanted to order. No drink order...no introduction...nothing. I had to prompt her that we were good to order drinks first -it being brunch and all we mostly opted for bloody's and mimosas. The bloody was good and refreshing. Not my favorite that I have had around, but not bad. Mimosas were good sized and had freshly squeezed OJ.   When we finally did decide to order, we kept it pretty basic. The menu isn't extensive so that's easy. We all had a variety of things including the American breakfast which was nice and simple with a great little biscuit. Someone had the biscuits and gravy as well as the hash and others had the waffles and other stuff. Generally, for taste, everything was good, but it was cold on our half of the table. Having waited a bit, we all just kind of ate and commented that although it was good cold, it would have been awesome hot. The people who had hot plates had nothing to complain about.   Getting the food was another story though -that took quite a while which made it annoying that some plates were cold and others were hot. If you knew you had to bring it out as it came, then I would rather one person have a hot meal and me have to wait for my hot meal as well.   Now this is where I am a bit more sympathetic: having to split a bill. Some tables can be really annoying and make it a tedious task. Generally POS systems make it fairly easy to split things off of the main bill (if they did 10 years ago, then there's no reason it shouldn't be even better these days!). We asked to have our bill split because she didn't do it from the start. Someone even asked her to make sure she did it from the beginning so we could avoid this at the end. She went around and wrote down what each person or couple had and it took FOREVER to get the bills back. No worries for the most part as we enjoyed being outside but still. Once we got them, they still weren't split correctly! At this point we each just paid whatever piece of paper we had in our hands. Luckily gratuity was already added-but it was 20% right off the bat (FYI).  The silver lining, I guess, was that our waitress also over ordered for our table so we got a free farm omlet which was yummy and a free mimosa.   I was SO excited about this place so I know I need to go back and try it again. Plus they offer so much else as far as dinner or snacks. The hype has to be genuine right?",

We had a reservation for 10 people, plus two infants.  When we arrived, on time, they had given our table to a walk-in party of 11 and told us we would need to wait.  After asking to speak with the manager and several conversations later, plus 30minutes of waiting, they tried to seat us at an 8-top.  There was no way we would all fit, so after all this, they dragged another table over so we could all comfortably sit.   The waitress was nice and it wasn't her fault, but other than that, the experience was not a good one.  The food was mediocre at best, they charged us for the drinks (coffee, lemonade and tea) that they have set up and tell you to help yourself but never mention the price!  The owner was there and knew what had happened with our reservation and never said a word to us.  All in all, I would NOT recommend this place at all!  Sad, because the location is beautiful.",

I was really looking forward to this place being all that it was suppose to be, but it was a little bit of a let down :( ... I'm not one to bash but the food coulda been a little better, omelette didn't have much flavor, potatoes were a little salty, and the French toast was a little rubbery... Over all the place is nice you can't complain when you have Arizona winter weather, while most are in snow jackets and boots I'm wearing t-shirts and shorts ... ;-)  I'll Probably won't be back but it was a nice experience, I'll most likely be at the Waffle House next weekend. Lol... I sure do miss the Grove Cafe - it's closed but they are having a charity event Dec 14 for Salvation Army Christmas Angels - 100% of the proceeds go to the charity! Now that's sweet!!",

I heard birds singing in the trees, horses neighing in the background & the sun was shining through the trees.  WHAT.  WHERE AM I.  This is not the South Mountain I am used to... thankfully.  This place is a little escape... a farm oasis in the middle of the desert.  Me gusta.  i had the South Mountain Omelette.  It had lots of tasty seasonal veggies, goat cheese & a little zing of green chile sauce.  I also opted for the seasonal fruit... glad I did.  Everything was so fresh.  I left feeling satisfied & happy, not overly stuffed like I do at most greasy breakfast places.  You know the ones.  Coffee, tea & water are self-serve.  I like that.  A lot.  Our waitress was very sweet.  A little boy ran out into the gardens & one of the farmers gave him a little squash.  What??  Is this real life???  I didn't think places like this still existed but I am so happy that they do.  :)",

But I would only recommend this place for special occasions or times where you have all morning to grab a bite. The wait time was quoted at 30 minutes but it was really about 50 and the tables are not very comfortable once you're seated. You sit very close to the next table and the service is just ok- not spectacular. I would have enjoyed it more if they had additional shops or local stands out to look through! Beware of falling leaves while you eat though :p",

    "text": "Beautiful outdoor cafe where I am finally okay with going somewhere filled with families and aren't bothered. Seriously though, PHX area is overflowing at the brim with families out to eat everywhere so it was awesome to find a delicious, fresh, local breakfast option where I wouldn't lose my mind over all the screaming children. While MGC does cater to families each table feels secluded and you can take in the nature and beauty of the farm, not to mention eat and chat in peace. Another reason for picking MGC is their use of local sustainable ingredients. As a vegetarian I think its really important to support local farmers so I am happy to see this trend picking up in AZ. I enjoyed the white truffle egg skillet with local veggies, it was phenomenal. Being veg I can sometimes get shafted by just eggs and toast dishes or the occasional bland omlette but this dish was so flavorful and full of deliciously chopped veggies (I know I saw some potatoes, cauliflower, bell pepper and green onion to name a few). I would considering bumping my fav breakfast dish 'eggs florentine' down a notch for this skillet.",

    "text": "To begin, I really wish I could rate the food and the service separately. I would give the service a 1 and the food a 4. I had been wanting to go to The Farm at South Mountain for some time now and waited until the weather cooled down in order to go try out this place I have heard so much about. The organic farm, rose garden, picnic tables, shade trees, and the whole ambiance of the farm was wonderful. It was almost like we weren't in Arizona anymore.         As we approached the hostess she was clearly not the most patient of people. She stated that she was not going to wait long for people to come up to claim their table when she called their name. You practically had to run up there in order to get seated at your table, otherwise she swiftly moved down the list to the next name. I think allowing people a good 60 seconds to make it up to the hostess to claim their table sounds reasonable, don't you? To be fair, it was 12:30pm and I think they close at 1, but still...  She directed us to our table where we sat ourselves to view the menu. The server came over and promptly informed us that they were out of french toast, the Monte Cristo, and that you could not order bacon or sausage on the side. The only way you could get bacon or sausage is if you ordered an item on the menu that included it. Apparently they were almost out of that too! A bit ridiculous if you ask me. I ended up ordering the Blueberry Waffles which were absolutely phenomenal. The whipped cream on top was the best whipped cream I have ever tasted. My dining companion ordered the American Breakfast and asked for the eggs on the side, on an additional plate because he is allergic to eggs. Of course, the plate ended up coming out with the eggs on the plate with the rest of his food. Food allergies should be taken seriously. Obviously, the allergy note got lost somewhere along the line. I ended up eating his eggs, which were really great as well. I also tried the breakfast potatoes that came with his breakfast and found them well seasoned and very tasty.        My dining companion will not be returning to this restaurant. Normally after an experience like this I wouldn't either. I did really like the food & ambiance though, so I will probably give this place another try. I think I will come earlier so they don't run out of the french toast again! I really wanted to try that... I hope that I am able to revise this review in the future.",

The atmosphere is wonderful. It's quiet, laid-back, and beautiful. Morning Glory is set on a farm property near South Mountain. I found it easy to forget that I was still in the middle of a major metropolitan area.  And the food is excellent. I had French toast with apple butter and pecans. The thick slices of country bread were soft but never got soggy with syrup. I also had some locally made sausage, which had a delightful hint of spice that really offset the sweetness of the rest of the meal.  I would definitely recommend this place, especially on a nice spring or autumn morning.",

The parking across the street (don't drive in the ditch thinking it is the driveway), the long walk down the gravel road (something my Father would not be into), to the bark path and hard to read signage.  We went on a Thursday around 9am and shared the place with one other couple. I had the Monte Cristo Breakfast and it was awesome. My wife had the South Mountain Omelet and it was fresh and tasty. The goat cheese along with the salsa verde made the omelet. The coffee was luke warm at best. I asked our server if he could freshen it up a bit, he took it and threw it in the bushes. He said that is what they do on the farm. He returned with a fresh cup. The coffee is not spectacular at all, marginal at best. He was a good server with about 5 tables by the end of our meal. I am not a fan of the limited beverage selection there. I understand if they don't want fountain drinks there, but they should have an old time Coke machine for those that like soda. Either that or a self serve beverage tub with ice. All and all it was a good $32 breakfast. But not something that would draw me back again.",

    "text": "Good place but I am a breakfast lover and would say that it's worth going to but not the place I would make my regular hangout.  We came here twice in a three week span and had two very different experiences.  The first time was mid morning on the weekend.  Very busy as you would expect as it is very popular.  Don't necessarily park across the street and walk all the way up the gravel road.  There is typically a couple few spots right by the place so drive the gravel road and park.  The wait was an hour but we were ok with that because we wanted to try it.  We had the eggs benedict, over medium eggs and home made sausage, and shared the blueberry waffles with vanilla whip cream.  All very good.  The coffee and drinks you get yourself on the back counter.  The service was relatively good the first time even though you could tell she didn't want to be there.  The second time we arrived later on the weekend, still busy, but only a 15 minute wait.  Cool.  We ordered the blueberry waffle again, ham and cheese omelet, and the over medium eggs with bacon this time.  Get the sausage, the bacon was thin and greasy.  This time the server tells us 2 minutes before the food is delivered that they ran out of whip cream for the waffles.  We're like, ok fine.  I'll tell you what, they are much better with that vanilla whip cream.  The omelet looked like they ran out of cheddar cheese too because there was none inside and on top just a sprinkle, strange.  The server was a nice kid but absolutely didn't want to be there and wasn't attentive at all.  Not too mention the table was FUBAR'ed.  No exaggeration, if you pushed on the table table top with two fingers you could flip a drink over because it swayed a foot either way.  Nice.  Look, we were gentle with the table, didn't complain, just wanted the same food from the time before.  Not the case.   Also, don't forget this is outdoor.  So keep that in mind if you don't like the outdoors.  Very pretty area.",

As they don't serve hot breakfast @ The Farm, they told us about Morning Glory Cafe and we walked back.  It is quaint and lovely.  Upon arrival at the desk, the gal said we could grab a coffee or water while we wait.  We killed a few minutes by grabbing coffee (half a cup) and waiting out front.  The food was very good -- my husband had the brisket & eggs and I had the omlette of the day.  My only complaint, and I can see several others have commented on this, is the casual manner in which they tell you about grabbing a self serve coffee.  If they can't tell you they will charge you for it up front, then it should be clearly posted as such at the drink dispenser area.  We would have never gotten a half a cup of coffee each if we had known it would add $6 to our bill.  This is a big no no and has a way of turning people off even when the overall experience was good.  Dear Morning Glory:  please post something indicating the cost of the beverages that are casually mentioned by your hostess.  This feels a bit deceitful.  Thank you.",

Morning Glory  is a great little out of the way place .Seating is all outside and the view is near Maya's Garden and Quiescence. It has that \"local\" vibe , people are streaming in in their hiking and biking  clothes, families with kids and dogs in tow seem to have been here before.   We were quickly seated passing by a waitress with two platters with the French toast / Monte Cristo type sandwich . Big enough to feed a family of five..Holy Guacamole as my 2nd graders say.  We settle in after getting ourselves  either tea, water or lemonade.. can't decide if i love or hate this... get your own beverage..  yeah I can get my own whenever I  want.... oh dang I got to get up again and get my drink ...  I ordered the South Mountain Omelet which has the on site grown veggies from Maya's . Heavy on the zucchini   light on the goat cheese, very tasty.  A small but tasty biscuit came with it.   Friend enjoyed their egg sandwiches and all were happy and content.   Light mental note --this is outside on a \"farm/garden\" there will be bright sun and we had a lot of flies. Off putting for some ..not us.   Cute little place definitely going on my take mom here list. I'll be back.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday which was on a Wednesday in March. The weather was beautiful and breezy. There were some people but there were many open tables so we got right in. We also brought our little dog since we planned to go hiking after and wanted to bring her. It was nice to find a place to bring your four legged friend! Anyways, the first thing we noticed was the self serve coffee, water and lemonade. We actually liked this idea! The only thing that I had an issue with is that they don't mention that there is a charge for the lemonade. They really should have a sign or something that mentions this. While looking over the menu, we noticed that the trees above us kept shedding leaves which we really were not excited about getting into our meals when they arrived. The waitress was really nice and moved an umbrella over to shield us a little from the greenage dropping into our food.  I decided on the monti cristo (over easy eggs, ham, and swiss cheese sandwiched between french toast with maple syrup) and my husband chose the cheese omelet with home fries. The monti cristo was soooo good. The only issue was that I noticed pieces of paper packaging still on my ham. It wasn't very much but it was a bit irritating having to peel little pieces of paper off of my ham! My husband was not impressed with his meal at all. He said the cheese on the omelet was nothing more than velveeta, the biscuit served with his meal was grainy and tough, and the home fries were not very flavorful.  The prices were pretty high for breakfast and my husband said his breakfast didn't even fill him up.  After breakfast, we walked around the farm a bit which was cool. The only thing we noticed was that there were no signs up next to each crop stating what they were. I would have liked to know what each was.  To sum it up, it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere and I was happy that I could bring my little doggie. However, I didn't feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am, I really don't like to have distractions from eating my meals (leaves falling in my food, packaging on my ham...). I don't think we would go back unless our dogs wanted to go our for breakfast. Haha",

    "text": "They had us the moment we drove up the bark chipped driveway, through the arbor, and up to the patio with red checked table cloths.  the day before, we had breakfast at La Grande Orange, and my husband was sure I couldn't top that experience...but Yelp did not disappoint!!  I had the Monte Cristo....slow roasted Black Forest Ham, thinly sliced, and served with an egg-over (had mine over hard...it's a yolk thing) with swiss cheese and sandwiched between brioche french toast....delightful!  Hubs had a sausage omelet with veggies and hash browns....  To speak to the prices...I honestly don't think that paying $10-$11 per breakfast entree is exorbitant. Especially when you realize that they are serving food made from mostly organic, and all premium sources.There is a price involved when a restaurant stays True to a seasonable and sustainable food source, and I'm willing to pay a few bucks extra for \"slow food\" vs. fast.  the $9 Bloodies were a bit steep, but by the time I had mine plus half of my husbands, I was as happy as can be:)  Warning: only visit the Morning Glory Cafe when you have time to relax and enjoy....uptight people need not attend...be prepared to stroll through the Artist's Studio and Maya's Farm....we stayed so long we almost went to lunch at the Farm Kitchen!  We look forward to coming back for dinner at Quinessence next time we visit Phoenix.  Big love to Wayne Smith for creating such a delightful venue!!",

Yes you have to get your own water/coffee and yes the service is a bit inconsistent. If you can't get past that, then I recommend Denny's. They're all over the place. If you can dig a relaxed pace in a very serene, almost bucolic setting in the middle of the desert with the best monte cristo I've ever had, then head over to Morning Glory. Can't wait to try the dinner restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is too cute. It's a great date spot, it feels like you are a million miles away from the city. We didn't have to wait for a table, but if you do, I would take the opportunity to explore the farm. It really is a cool place.  I had the American breakfast and my date had the Monte Cristo. Both were delicious.  A couple of tips, the coffee/lemonade/tea is all self-serve from a table by the building, but it is not complimentary. So if you grab yourself a coffee and a lemonade for example you will be charged for two beverages. Personally I would prefer if they just did away with the self-serve table and had the servers bring the beverages like other restaurants.  It is outside seating so in the cooler weather the meals cool down quickly. Also, you may be pelted with leaves or twigs from the surrounding trees if the wind blows and get a friendly bird or two hoping for a bit of your breakfast. I think it is part of the charm of the place, but yes you may be picking leaves out of your hair as you leave.  Also, the bathroom is a little rustic. It's a step above an outhouse really. It is clean-ish for what it is but you have been warned.",

    "text": "There is a lot of hype for this place but the breakfast was pretty mediocre and over priced for an outdoor only restaurant.  The menu has your standard breakfast items which include sandwiches, omelets, waffles, french toast. Although the ingredients are partly locally grown, the flavors are bland and taste similar to what I would prepare myself in the comfort of my home...and I could take it to my patio if I wanted to eat outside.  All items range 11-15 bucks. Drinks are all self serve which is a little annoying too. I usually like to be served when I go to a restaurant.  It's outdoor seating and it can get pretty warm. At least the tables are shaded but it's like 90 degrees in early April so it's not a very comfortable experience.  Overall Morning Glory is all hype. The food is not the quality of the Michelin star breakfast place as it is of price.  I guess I wouldn't come back unless the prices were more reasonable and the weather was nicer (like month of February only).   There are so many more unique breakfast/brunch spots in Phoenix that also use fresh products that I would rather visit.",

This place can get slammed and they are only open during the bearable time of the year heat wise so make sure to call before heading out there!  Love the American breakfast and breakfast burrito, the eggs are tasty, the produce are fresh.  Go there to feel like you are in the country come back for the food. You can't go wrong with this place.

I would've given this place 5 stars IF they had inside seating, but they don't. Eating outside on a farm is nice, but the Arizona heat and farm flies, made me take away a star! Yes, there's plenty of shade, and they do their best to bust the tables quickly to keep away the bugs and pests.  The food tastes just like everything was grown right on site, as it should, because it is! The fruit was beautiful and juicy and sweet. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The best was the waffle! OMG crispy but fluffy with the right flavor!   This place is a must if you're in the Phoenix area. Great service, beautiful scenery, and delicious food at a reasonable price!",

Do not count on Yelps posted hours go directly to the website itself. Today it was only open 8-11am. Enjoyed our meal (also a very limited selection) we both had the pork omlette which was tasty and a large portion. The extreme amount of flies was kinda gross. If the manager/owner reads this I would suggest some measures about keeping flies away. For example there are plants flies don't like (basil, mint and tansy) that could be added to each table as a centerpiece. Just a thought.",

    "text": "I am yet again a failure at planning anything so when my boyfriend asked me where I wanted to go for brunch when we landed early in Phoenix, it was up to him to save the afternoon! He quickly found this place and it looked 10x better than anything I had book marked so we took our rental car here asap.   Its kind of hard to find because its located in the back of the farm. There is no restaurant sign which is what we were looking for at first. There are a bunch of other restaurants on the premises but this was the only one that was busy the entire time.  20 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. I think they messed up and let the guy after us get seated before but whatever. I grabbed myself an iced tea from the self serve section while we waited and shared it with my boyfriend teehee. The wait didn't seem long at all because we got to walk around the beautiful farm!   I got the farm omelette and he got the pork is the new black omelette because I refused to let him get the same thing as me. Our order took FOREVER to come out. People that were seated at the same time/after us were pretty much done with their orders by the time ours came out. I think they must've forgotten our order or something wtf. Bastards. Our waiter Dexter kept reassuring us our order was on our way though.    The biscuit was bomb! I am so happy our waiter offered us some jam because I pretty much loaded my entire biscuit with enough jam for the both of us. So noms. Totally worth the 500 buttery calories it probably was. I should've subbed the goat cheese in my omelette but I wasn't thinking. It came with cauliflower and carrots and all sorts of veggies I've never seen in an omelette before!   All in all a perfect way to start off our little weekend getaway in Arizona!",

The grounds make you feel like you are eating right smack in the middle of a working farm.  You can walk around the different areas, even check out gift shop.  There usually is a wait, but luckily it has never been more than 10 or 15 minutes. The tables are wobbly and the ground is hard to walk on in many areas (don't bring your heels or wedges here), but adds to the unique, agricultural yet homey atmosphere.   As far as the food goes, I have tried a few different dishes from the french toast, pork omelet, eggs Benedict, and American breakfast.  They are all delicious, I haven't had anything I did not enjoy. Love the lemonade, and the muffins are house-baked.  Try this place out on one of our many beautiful sunny Arizona mornings.   Tip- bring your furry friends, this is a pet friendly patio. Tip- good location for different group events, from yoga to weddings.",

You definitely don't feel like you're in Arizona when you're here. The grounds are surprisingly lush and there's a lot of plant life. I did expect a farm when I visited, but aside from the few plants here and there - there's not much farmland. Moving on to the restaurant, the menu is definitely pricey. You are paying for the ambiance. The service was also very slow. I was actually audibly complaining to my boyfriend (sorry honey) about the long wait when the waitress finally brought out our food.   I had the \"Back To Your Roots\" which is a vegetable omelette, over-easy eggs, and a buttermilk biscuit. The meal was very good. Just a headsup on the veggie omelette - it's quite carrot-heavy so if you're not a fan, I'd reconsider.  Again, I'm so glad we went on a day with beautiful weather. I can't imagine the outdoor dining experience is very pleasant in 113 degree weather. Overall, a great brunch place to visit when the weather's nice.",

    "text": "Went for Sunday Brunch in late December.  It was crisp around 9am, but not to cold, the Sun was out, and the outdoor heaters were humming, so it was enjoyable.    All seating, we could see, was outside, so plan to enjoy the elements.  We were seated quite promptly, and handed two menus by our very attentive waitress Candice.   Coffee, tea, lemonade, and water are self serve, but not complimentary.  The coffee was nice, but found lots of grounds in my cup.    Selection was quite large, with plenty of options, savory, sweet, hot/mild, etc... We decided to compliment our choices.  I went with the \"Back to your roots\", because of the sauteed vegetables with a \"buttermilk biscuit\", and added the gravy on the side.  Sadly, not the Combo I should have gone with.  Mr. Man, due to my savory choice, chose the \"Monte Cristo\" with bacon syrup, a winner on all accounts, savory/sweet, with bacon syrup and powdered sugar.  How can that be wrong?  It wasn't.   The results:   BTYR:  I had high hopes for this one, seasonal sauteed veggies with eggs, potatoes, and a buttermilk biscuit!  Scrumdealyumptious!  Sadly, expectations were not met.  The veggies and eggs were delightful, light and sauteed/roasted veggies, with perfect eggs.  That's where bliss ended.  The potatoes were bland and limited 'breakfast potatoes' you'd find at Denny's or elsewhere, not a knock on Denny's, just expected more from a \"Farm Fresh\" offering.  Freshly shredded hash browns and/or Dutch fries would have been a great touch, not the frozen fried lackluster potato offering presented.    As a southerner, I'm partial to my \"buttermilk biscuits\", they should be light/fluffy and biscuit sized.  The \"biscuit\", was more sconish than biscuit, and dense, not airy like a \"buttermilk biscuit\", should be.   The biscuit gravy, forget about it, the roux was poor consistency and greasy, with some decent sausage chunks.  Might I suggest some southern cooking websites to work with, on presenting an improved gravy product, less grease more 'roux' for the gravy.  I'll bring in the grandmother, if needed.    Suggestion:  Cheese drop Biscuit(s)   2 cups Flour 2 tsps baking powder   2/3 cup of buttermilk/milk 8 oz cheese 3 oz butter/margarine  Mix, drop, bake 400F - 15 minutes.  Light, airy, delicious!  Monte Cristo:  Awesome!  Can you beat toasted/griddled brioche bread, filled with Ham, eggs (over easy), and cheese, dusted with powdered sugar, surrounded by a pool of syrup, doused with bacon pieces?  No you cannot!  Mr. Man shared this delicacy, but gobbled away.  It was delicious!  Definitely worth a return showing.    We're giving it 3.4 out of 5, can't go 3.5 due to the rounding up challenge.  Love the atmosphere, it's fun and playful.  Farm fresh is pushing the envelope in our book.  The potential is there!  Will be back to take on the Benedict and Huevos  Rancheros, will pass on anything biscuit and/or gravy related until the beatings continue and morale improves.",

Would have been nice if they put the syrup on the side instead of pouring it on the toast, so if you don't like the french toast to be really sweet ask for the syrup on the side.

Next time we'll try on a weekday or early morning.  Self service beverages were nice before we got a table. My first coffee was tasty but the refill looked like an oreo blend, guess I got the bottom of the pot.  Our food was tasty. Priced accordingly seeing as produce and proteins are sourced locally. A great majority of the dishes are served vegetarian with the option to add Shreiners meats for a $3 or  $4 upgrade.  Our food took 40 minutes to arrive after we ordered. We then waited another 15 or so for the check. The view was great though and temperatures were perfect for late summer. I just felt bad holding a table for a while when we had been ready to leave.  I almost feel like counter service would be faster and more efficient for the space. Seeing as beverages are already self serve and a food runner brought my meal, I have a hard time supporting a great tip for my server when they are only responsible for taking my order and bringing the check :/  Overall I'll certainly be returning to Morning Glory, but I'll need a snack before breakfast.",

Sometimes I just forget, try things I might regret,  just break the eggs and I'll have it over easy.  I don't want to lose the yolk,  I could never eat it alone  I am a foodie who will try all your dishes, I can give you a review you're dreaming of.  We'll brunch forever, knowing together  that we ate it at the Morning Glory Cafe!  Morning Glory Cafe is one of the gems hidden in South Phoenix area.  It's literally a huge garden and picnic area.  Perfect for a day outing with the family and friends.  I usually go after a hike at South Mts. since its right down the street or around the area.  Walking past the picnic area and organic gardens you wouldn't think you're actually in Phoenix; except if it's super hot out!    Brunch!  My favorite meal of the day when I can get it!  This time around I ordered their Eggs Benedict, which they called the Morning Glory Benedict.  Poached eggs, spinach, and ham on two muffins with hollandaise sauce; seems pretty simple, but damn I love it!  Also free self serving lemonade and ice tea -- load up!    There's something about having brunch right outside over viewing the farm and picnic like scenery.  It's relaxing yet you feel connected with the natural setting.  Someone pinch me.....Ouch!  Okay back to my office....sigh!    Needless to say, Morning Glory Cafe, if I could sing like Peter Cetera that's my anthem to you.  The place is sweet and cute.  No mimosas this time around, but look for me on the next round! - Enjoy!",

Morning Glory is one of 3 restaurants on the Farm at South Mountain.  As you may have guessed, this is the restaurant that serves breakfast.  I bring all my out of town guests here that like to get up and have a nice breakfast.  The atmosphere can't be beat.  All the seating is outdoor/patio seating.  When you are sitting back there, you completely forget that you are sitting in a farm in the middle of Phoenix!  I usually order lite breakfast items like a couple eggs and a toast, but I've tried the French bread there and I enjoyed it.  My friends have all enjoyed their meals as well.  I also enjoy their coffee.    For the novice, you will find Morning Glory all the way at the end of the drive onto the Farm.  I would recommend parking in the spaces at the end of the drive instead of using the parking lot just east of 32nd St.  You can take a walking tour around the section of the organic farm adjacent to Morning Glory.  There's a chicken coop right there and you can see some of the produce.  The green house to the east of the chicken coop.  And you might find that the artist's studio is open that day, it would be west of the chicken coop.  The patio seating is friendly to dogs, but don't take your dog beyond the perimeter of the restaurants.  Maya's farm is an organic farm and you can't take dogs in the area where the plants are growing!  Watch out for the signs that warn you if you bring your pooch to b'fast with you.  Morning Glory is a solid option for breakfast.  I especially like to invite visitors there for breakfast.  You will like it too.  Trust me.",

I ordered the American breakfast with over easy eggs I was given a tiny biscuit to eat the yolk with and was not given the option for any other bread. We had a party of 8. We were automatically charged 20% on our check for tip. Sounds standard right? Well the beverages were self serve. So in that sense I partially paid to serve myself. The check was $130 plus $23 tip for getting up and down to get myself and my children our beverages in small cups. In addition I was also lost when trying to find the place. I drove between 30th st and 32nd st. The entrance is at 32nd st though so we spent some time with that too. The staff did get set up umbrellas when it really started heating up, but we were directly in the sun and our table was not one that received an umbrella, and the flies were relentless which made me want to wrap up brunch quickly. I may try this place again in the future but getting charged a $23 service fee with self serve drinks kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Meh.",

They are dog friendly too so a plus if you like pets as there were many many dogs there. Got the veggie omelet and the berry waffle. Both were just ok. The portions were on the small side for the price but I did enjoy how fresh the food tasted. I was sooo excited for the biscuit but that too was very small. Like half the size of a normal biscuit. I'm a germ freak so I did not appreciate the serve yourself drink as I saw many people dipping their cup into the ice instead of using the scooper that was there. Our server was attentive and helpful since I had never been there before. Will be back again since the ambience was perfect. They also have live music on the weekends!",

They said the farm reminded them of the Valley when they were growing up. The service was great. We sat under a heat lamp on the patio. The little ones weren't too happy with the granola/yogurt dish, but they enjoyed the sausage and eggs. I ordered the gluten-free creamy corn porridge w/ maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples (the sausage had a surprising spicy pepper kick). A nice selection of hot teas. After we ate, we wandered around Maya's Farm, looking at the newly sprouting crops, chickens with \"funny\" hats. Giant squashes and gourds. My aunts bought fresh baked pies and jams from Joe who was warm and welcoming.",

Would've preferred if the French Toast Bread Pudding did not come drenched in maple syrup - much nicer to sweeten as needed.  The country fried steak was unfortunately not as good as Denny's and our favorite version in the Valley at Texaz - this one got soggy quickly under the gravy. My veg and egg skillet with white truffle oil was tasty but seemed a bit small and would've benefited from a side of toast.  Other Valley breakfast eateries like Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast offer more satisfying food.  Come here to get away from the city and stretch your legs on the farm.  For only a few bucks more, eat at Quiessence and get more comfy seating, real table cloths and glass cups instead of help-yourself paper ones, which really isn't as earth-friendly.",

Seriously, I'm not into it, but the french toast monte christo sandwich is an amazing fix for the heart-attack prone.  The setting is absolutely unassuming and casual, with plastic chairs and self-serve coffee.  And yes, it is on a farm with 100% outdoor seating.  There's even an occasional breeze that may blow mesquite leaves onto your plate.  But if this sort of encounter somehow does not relax you, or even bothers you, then I suggest going next door for a wonderful massage at the spa.

I went in early May and found that they only had outdoor seating with no misters/fans which made having brunch in 90' heat unpleasant.  The trees were shedding into the food (there are things known as umbrellas).  The bucolic country ambiance I found nice (though not for everyone).  The food was totally pedestrian. I could cook everything myself and do a better job.  The one of the poached eggs was cooked all the way through.   The cowboy chili and eggs weren't great (the meat in the chili was really grainy and tough).    I had the breakfast tacos, and it was fine -- the chorizo wasn't as good as you can get in the valley.  The self-serve coffee and lemonade was nice.   But there wasn't anything write home about.  In summary this is a low 2* review (I reserve 1* for places that can make you sick).",

There is usually a line for breakfast but once you sign in you can walk the grounds and garden or sit on the outside patio (in front of the other restaurant that's only open for dinner).  This place is also dog friendly and if you get a drink from the bakery up front, you can refill it at the cafe when you sit down for breakfast.  When we come here, we always go for the French Toast and something else.  Have you ever had something so good that it ruins it for you to get it anywhere else?  This is what their French Toast did to me...from that moment on...all French Toasts will be compared to this one.  The bread they use is super light and fluffy, sprinkled w/toasted pecan & served w/warm & silky maple syrup.  It's really simple...yet so unbelievably delicious.  We usually also get some sort of egg breakfast and they've been pretty good.  Their potatoes are also good and I always request mine extra crispy like my bacon.  Another plus is they have fresh-squeezed OJ and the service is always prompt, courteous and mindful.",

We were a bit squished but it worked out fine. I will admit we were a little worried since our taxi driver had no clue what we were talking about but he found it and it was beautiful from the moment we pulled up.   Anyways, the atmosphere was wonderful, really laid back. The drinks (minus mimosas) were all self-serve. My fiance is a bit of an eggs benedict snob and he loved them!

The portions were pretty generous, even though everything was a couple dollars more than I thought was necessary.  Especially since you have to get your own coffee and water.    Also, it was a nippy winter morning, and the fire-stick-heater thing by us wasn't lit.  We had to ask twice before someone brought the warmth back.  That being said, though, I would absolutely come back for brunch on a lazy weekend, and take my precious time lounging in the garden patio, checking out the scenery and being serenaded by happy chickens.",

The setting seems a world away from the city, but it took less than 10 minutes to get to the airport.  Parking signs direct cars to park across the street, so I did, but one can actually drive back to the Morning Glory Cafe.  I didn't mind the 4 minute walk as the grounds are beautiful.  I sat on the patio overlooking the gardens.  Since the waitress asked if I wanted something to drink, I assumed she would provide it.  She informed me that coffee, tea and lemonade were behind me and it was self serve.  No biggy - but all the cups were disposable, including clear plastic cups for water (not necessarily a huge deal if they didn't tout their recycling efforts and sustainability on the back of the menu).  The coffee was very weak... and I tried 2 different containers.  Boo!   Service was good even with a packed patio.  They did use their farm ingredients in many of the dishes.  I ordered the white truffle scrambled egg & local veggie skillet, which came with sauteed cauliflower, peas, green beans, and a couple strips of spinach.  The veggies were fresh, but the dish lacked flavor.  Maybe I was expecting some fresh herbs or more seasoning?    The setting is a 4, the service is a 3-4, but the food which is the most important part - a 3.  I would go back to try one of the other two restaurants.  Lunch on the picnic benches or a nicer dinner at Quiessence, with daily menu changes, sounds appealing.",

My group of 6 arrived at 10:30am for brunch on a Saturday. The place was PACKED! Always a good sign I say. We waited about 1/2 hour to get our table but time flew by with conversations and relaxing/taking in the scenery of the farm. Once seated we all pulled out pens and drew all over our butcher paper table cloth. Us 20/30 something year olds turned into 7 year olds drawing all over the table.   Our service was great! For as crazy busy as they were everything came out tasting wonderful! I ordered up the eggs benedict. All of the egg dishes use the farms eggs from chickens you can see for yourself just a few yards away. Yum yum! I also got to sample some of my friends applewood smoked bacon. OMG! This bacon will make you drool for more! In her words \"They really smoke it with real apples!\" hehe One of the best parts of the meal that really impressed me was that they have a self serve station for water, tea and coffee. I liked not having to wait for our waitress to bring me more water or coffee I could just jump up and get it myself.   Don't try to make this a quick stop for breakfast or brunch. Plan to spend the morning or afternoon there and take in the relaxing outdoors, the restaurant, farm and to local shopping just steps away. Enjoy and relax!",

    "text": "Nice brunch on a beautiful day.  The place was still pretty packed at noon (they close at 1pm).  We ordered the eggs benedict, All American breakfast and egg white omelet.  Everything was very good. I'm not a mushroom fan so I didn't try the egg white omelet (it has portabello mushrooms in it).  But the benedict was tasty and teh all american breakfast came with a great biscuit that was super flaky.  Portions are not huge, but satisfying.  Its nice to be able to sit under large historic trees and enjoy the weather and company.  For those who have dogs you can bring them there!  Its a bit on the the pricey side (its no 2.99 special at Denny's), but you pay for the relaxing atmosphere.",
