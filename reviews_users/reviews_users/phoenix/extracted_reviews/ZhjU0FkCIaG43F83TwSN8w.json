    "text": "On service alone, this place is a 5. Sidney was really personable. As first time customers, she went over the concept of dave and busters with us as well as their philanthropic endeavors. Additionally she talked about the games, menus and specials with us.    The food was slightly above average, nothing really remarkable, though the lobster Alfredo was really delicious.  We ordered a berry cherry mojito which came with no cherry or mint.  While it was delicious and refreshing, I would hardly call it a mojito.  The games are fun and the atmosphere is entertaining, also a good place to come to watch the games as they have dozens of big screen TVs.  All in all, I am glad I checked this place out, pretty much what I expected.",

Oh and we had to wipe out own table down prior to sitting... The staff seems like they don't even want to be here. I get it, you are at work on a Saturday but why not make the best of it and give the customer a good experience. We are celebrating my MIL's birthday and it's kind of put a damper on the night.   My husband had to ask for a server and also grab our own menus. Hopefully the food is worth the wait but I won't hold my breathe.. Might be another hour before we receive. :/  Well got our food.. Took forever. Decent but lukewarm.  We talked with the manager and he and the server apologized.",

We will be back !   If you never been here it is very loud !  And kids running around everywhere but it is great place to go for fun games prizes and decent food !   Good for families and young adults !  I like that they keep bringing in newer games had a blast playing the game called fish bowl ! Lots of fun !",

I would bot recommend eating there!!",

The waiter didn't even notice that a meal was missing. We had to tell him. By the time her food came out everyone was done. It took longer to receive her quesadilla than it took to bring our initial meals. How long does it take to make a quesadilla? Did he even bother to expedite since it was their screw up? We kept seeing all this other food come out but not the quesadilla. It isnt even busy. Also, check if your customers need refills. There's a thought.",

It was supposed to come with a cube light in the drink, but after it was already made they told the lovely server they ran out. I only ordered the drink for the glow part. (Wow factor) makes sense. So the server went and asked his manager to comp the drink and so the cheap manager, Omar just took off the price of the light ($2) :-/ Again, I only ordered the drink for the light! Unhappy to say the least. The rest of the order with the drinks and food was fine I was just baffled that they couldn't just comp the drink. :(",

Even though her parents were there an hour before the party was to begin, the table wasn't ready until Almost an hour past the time the party was to start!      After we were seated, and the obviously inexperienced waitress took our orders, it took forever for the food to come out! Several of the orders were wrong, and one order didn't come out until everyone else was finished with their meals. The price of the food was HIGH! On a positive note, everyone said their food was very good, once it finally came out!    The atmosphere would probably be fun for tweens and teens, but for the rest of us, it was SO LOUD, I was actually afraid it would damage our hearing. To be fair, my grandchildren had a great time, and enjoyed all the games!    I hope this review is helpful!",

The bar is usually short-handed and packed with people wanting a million cocktails.  They offer a rechargeable token card which is both a blessing and a curse.  After a few drinks, losing track of your tokens is the obvious outcome.  At least you can let out drunken war cries when killing zombies with a fake handgun and no one would think twice.  It's loud in here!  They also check your ID at the door after 9PM or something but unlike Los Angeles, they don't search your purse and have you go through a metal detector.  Yay?",

Kyle was our bartender/server and he was very nice and when our drinks were low he was there asking if we wanted another. The service was quick and the staff was friendly.  The food was delicious too. I love french fries and thiers are so scrumptious! I ordered the Bar Chicks which is the chicken tenders top coated with thier buffalo sauce, tomatoes, lettuce and blue cheese on mini buns. It was very good but a little hard to eat cause the chicken wasn't flat. It was thick in some places thin in others. I would recommend cutting your own chicken pieces and adding a little more buffalo sauce.  My fiance ordered the quesadillas and said they were really delicious although it's not sitting well in his stomach right now :-(  We both enjoyed this place and it's well needed fun!!

Well, think about this. You are TOUCHING surfaces that are coated with about 100 layers of kiddy snot, and when was the last time you noticed a kid (or a 18 yr old for that matter) wash their hands after using the lavatory? You haven't and they didn't, so anything you touch is contaminated with a veritable petri dish of bacterial pathogens. Then you are going to eat FINGER FOOD? Bad idea....so I didn't eat and guess what? I was fine the next day, which I could not say for a number of our party who did not study biology in college as I did.  They didn't feel so good. . Just DON'T EAT and you'll be find. And don't touch your face...carry handwipes. You get the picture.",

    "text": "Below I will give you some great advice on why and when to come here.  This will not be a food or service review.  Why? Because it's an arcade.  Regardless of their availabality or eatability of their food, I will come here for two things only, give or take:  \"House of the Dead\" and \"Aliens\".  My friends and I have burned through $100 of gametime on the \"Aliens\" game.  I saw that movie when it was released in theaters in the 80s. It was my first sci-fi movie, the scariest movie I had ever seen, and it had the most incredible machine guns...but they were more than my feeble brain could comprehend.  it still can't wrap itself around these futuristic man-toys - but now I can hold one and shoot nasty, scary Aliens with them, too.  I feel just like Sigourney Weaver with fatigues.  But I digress...Come here with the intent of spending hours on the Arcade games.  Don't come here for the food, don't come here for the \"Eat and Play\" combo.  Yeah, it's $15.99, and it gets you an entree and a $10 game card, but your choices will be BAR FOOD. burger, sandwhiches, dips, wings, nachos, yada yada.  If you come here with the intention of gettin plowed with your friends, then sucking at the Arcade Games because you can't focus...here are the best times for doing so: Happy Hour: Mon-Fri, 1/2 price cocktails, beer and wine specials -  4:30-7p Late Nite Happy Hour: Sun-Thurs, same specials as happy hour  however, i personally can do both simultaenously. and quite well. so happy hour here is a no brainer, as it is also \"power hour!\"  If you are like me and can spend 2-3 hours here, easy, on one or two games, the following are for you: POWER HOUR: Mon-Fri 4:30-7:00, 60min. for $10 (cheap date? half off cocktails and $10 game play in one hour?) WEDNESDAY: 1/2 off all games  other games i will play on 1/2 off game days: feel like i am on jeopardy by playing the super awesome \"Super Trivia\" (oh yes, i believe there is room for four other competitors, and you win tickets) jump into the driver's seat of a nascar in \"Daytona USA\" sweat like a maniac in \"dance dance revolution\"  Finally, if you are a ticket game person and think you will walk out of there with a new stereo because you kick ass at SkiBall, think again.  Three of us played for three hours, had thousands of tickets, and walked out of there with a shotglass, some jelly bellies, and a fart machine.  Expect to spend hundreds, if not more - in order to get something half way decent.",

    "text": "Take a group and go late.  There are two key issues that present hurdles to having an all around good time at Dave and Busters. The first issue is the food is terribly overpriced and the quality was not impressive as I have found it to be greasy at times or overcooked. The second issue revolves around the bloody ankle biters, why you would want to drag your kids to a bar is far beyond me (I do however see why having kids can make you want to drink heavily) so the only obvious circumvention is to go later in the evening to avoid the annoyance. The variety of arcade games is not bad. They have several group play racing and trivia games but they are missing some staple crowd pleasing games like air hockey and strangely absent are the fighting style games (Tekken, Street Fighter, Mortal Combat, etc.).     In a nutshell go later in the evening with a group for the games and stick to a simple faire of bar food or you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Tempe Market Place is a great place to wonder around in this time of year (spring) with a variety of restaurants, shops, etc. Dave and Busters is worth spending an hour or two in but if you want decent food I would look elsewhere.",

If the hunting video game could have given me a negative score, I probably would have gotten it.  We just had to check it out while we waited for a free concert to begin, even if my dexterity and video game skillz aren't quite what they were back in 1989 and even if we had to endure multiple nerd alerts.  This place is predictable.  Great concept, weak execution.  Average food, small weak cocktails and as others have said before tons of video games, skeeball and the like. The Thursday night scene consisted of ASU students, young suburban couples and packs of 20-something dudes, and thankfully no kids in sight.   The rechargeable card thing isn't exactly intuitive. I ended up getting charged a few more times than I should have.  Doh.  I'll probably come back when my 19 year old brother is in town, but for now I'll stick with house get-togethers for video games.",

This place doesn't quite live up, however there's always a place in my heart for Dave and Buster's, no matter how small and cheezy because I can drink ALCOHOL while slamming tokens into a game to win lots of tickets. Whee!   They've got a pretty decent happy hour too. The food is blech, wouldn't eat it again and it's expensive too. Everything else makes me happy.

The games on the other hand are a pretty cool addition to a night of food and drinks. There's pretty much something for everyone, from the traditional skeeball to the more ornate virtual boxing. I have fun skipping around like a three year old from one game to another, collecting tickets along the way like I'm driving through Texas. Georgeann G and I tried the \"what your baby would look like\" machine and the kid looked like Mike TV from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, that was pretty memorable.   Don't forget your fun...",

    "text": "I do not recommend coming here to play arcade games. I came on a Tuesday for their \"Power Hour\" which is advertised on their website as \"play an entire hour of UNLIMITED video games for $10\". See my photo screenshot - there's no fine print and no caveats. Obviously just like any other arcade, it won't work for ticket/redemption games. So I walk in and have to wait for an employee to (as the hostess described) walk to the farthest part of the place to get a Power Hour Card because they don't keep them up front...really? There is nobody else in line, so I wait while the hostess tries to make small talk. So I finally get my card, pay my $10 and I go to the closest video game, Rampage. Notice that I said \"video game\", not ticket/redemption game. I slide my card and start a game. It lasts about 2 minutes or so and I die, so I slide my card to continue. Nope - tells me I don't have enough credits. After a few more tries I go back up to the front and the hostess tells me the only video games the Power Hour Card works with are blue lighted. Now, keep in mind that this is nowhere on the advertisement (again, see photo screenshot) and this was not told to me during the whole time I was waiting for the card. The hostess calls up a manager who admittedly very nicely tells me there is a 60-second delay on the cards and I tell him I definitely played for more than 60 seconds. We walk over to the video games and he tells me that Rampage and a few other video games won't work for the Power Hour. First of all, I ask why it even allowed me to play it the first time, for which he has no answer. Then I tell him that's not on their advertisement - to which he tells me in fact it is - again, see screenshot photo from Dave & Buster's Tempe website. Why in the world would I pay to play unlimited video games for an hour if I can't even play video games. I give up on this guy because clearly he just wants to get me out of the place so without another word I get my money back and leave. Seriously, that is False advertising. It was just me, in between meetings, but what if I brought kids in to play and that's what we're greeted with. This place may be great for football games, food and beer - but most definitely not for Power Hour videos games.",

Whatever it was, I paid $4 for a fancy mixed drink. The only negatives is I wish they had more games to choose from.

Every single one of their *many* TVs had sports games playing on them. The dining area was packed.  The place is seat yourself and as soon as we chose a table we were quickly greeted by our server. He was very attentive and understanding to some altered food requests that we had.  I'm unfortunately on a diet so I stuck to a water, lettuce wraps, and a house salad for dinner. I was super envious of my hunnys food (pictured) and had to steal a few bites that were definitely against my diet.  Afterwards we played some very fun games. Dave & Busters never dissapoints us! They have deals on ticket points to purchase to buy to play. When you purchase up front at the kiosk the employees always make sure you get the most bang for your buck.  I've never had a bad time here and it is part of our regular date night rotation.",

    "text": "I went there with my family, we all did all you can eat wings and free game play. Everything was going  ok. I ordered a dr. Pepper and it tasted very weird and not right, so I just had gotten a new one the waitress noticed the flavor too for I let her taste it. Sounds weird right. We ate some wings and we had a batch left, the waitress said it was fine she wrote on a napkin saying don't throw away. We paid for the food. We where allowed to come back to the table and eat food so we could take a break from playing games. When I had come back to get a drink of my soda, I noticed that there was a half eaten lollipop in the left over batch we had left over that clearly stated that \"don't throw away!\"  My dad and I where very mad at it but couldn't really buy another batch since we had already paid. So we covered up the food making look like trash that needed to be taken away. Now this is the part where my parents had gotten pissed at what he saw while we where playing a game. There was a other family, there was two little boys and a mom. One boy chucked and airsoft puck at his brother, the puck flew right behind me and my sister. If we had moved farther back we would have been hit. The puck never hit his brother but hit the game, the brothers had ended up rough housing. They shock the game, it's rocking back and forth almost falling. While this is happening the mother does absolutely nothing, she just watched. No employees stopped them, we told some employees about a game not working. They didn't seem to care, games where ether broken or just full on stop working. There's no signs telling you games where broken.",

The facility is always clean and properly staffed for busy weekend nights. I'd suggest coming in before 5pm to take advantage of the eat and play combos that will definitely save you some money. They have dining tables, bar tables, bar stools and standing tables in the gaming area for whatever suits your needs. Be sure to hold on to your card to refill credits (or you have to buy another) and save your tickets for something cool. I'd recommend joining their email list- they normally send out buy $20 in games and get $20 free- what a deal!",

The day of the party, there were no slip ups in service - they were working with us throughout the event to ensure all was going well. The food was tasty, the small room we had was decorated appropriately and the servers were the consummate professionals! I highly recommend this as a spot for a couple hours of relaxation and an opportunity to put some fun into your work day/week. Nice work Dave and Buster's!",

I went to meet the two of them one day and my daughter was having a blast.    The Power Card is such a cool idea, letting kids save up their tickets toward a larger prize.  Of course, with a four year old the idea is still a hard pill to swallow.  Still, she was able to redeem her tickets for a couple really decent prizes (much better selection than Peter Piper, for sure).  I brought her back the other day since she was cooped up inside when the a/c guys were replacing our a/c.    With a Buy $10, get $10 coupon, I would have received 100 tokens.  They had an add on that gave me an additional 25 tokens for $3.  So for $13 I got 125 tokens.  Normally you get 50 tokens for $10.  The games are not cheap.  Each game she wanted to play was somewhere between 3.7 tokens and 7.9 tokens.  There were also some games that cost more than 10 tokens each.  And not all of the games guaranteed a minimum number of tickets (important when you are saving up for the SECOND unicorn with a blue mane that costs 925 tickets).    After she'd earned enough tickets for the unicorn (thanks to help from me), she just wanted to get out of there.  That was 45 minutes after we'd arrived.  Fine by me!    She told my mom later that she was bored there with me and she only wanted to go with my mom.    This just goes to show you I may be a fun gal, but I am not \"the fun mom.\"  That's okay.  I make up for it in love.  ;)",

    "text": "Some economists have been predicting the collapse of the world economy. Currencies will be worth nothing and there will be pandemonium in the streets. I, however, will be able to weather this catastrophe for one reason and one reason only. Because in the end times I will be left holding the one asset and currency that will still be worth something....the Dave and Buster's prize ticket.  In case you have been living in the Batcave for years watching John Candy films, which sounds like an incredible life, let me explain how the ticket system works. Anytime you play a game here you have the possibility to win tickets. The more tickets you earn the more stuffed animals, candy dispensers, plastic balls, and crappy toys you can acquire. And who doesn't love crappy toys? Answer? No one. Everyone hates crappy toys. When I was little I used to make fun of this kid because his parents were poor and all he got was knockoff toys. I got Transformers he got Go-Bots. I got Robocop he got Robot Cop. I got a lightsaber and he got a laser sword. I got Pirates of the Carribean. He got Pirates of the High Seas.   What's also cool about Dave and Busters are the legendary skee ball tournaments I put together as soon as I get there. Typically I'll corner off the three lanes on the right and start waging war on innocent seven year olds. Tip; if they start beating you grab one of their balls when they aren't looking so you have one more chance to hit that elusive and legendary 100 point cup.   Bottom line if you want to drop $100 to acquire enough tickets for a Dora the Explorer glow in the dark pen then this joint is your spot.",

We started off with two scooby snack drinks. It had way too much alcohol in it. Thought I was going to fart powdered alcohol or something. I ordered the short rib and Mac&cheese sandwich with tots. The cheese separated from the macaroni so I was eating bland noodles on top of cold short rib which was odd because the bread was warm. Like the cheese had enough of the macaroni's crap so it packed its stuff and slept on the couch at the short ribs house...that's how pathetically bad it was. The tots weren't so bad. The bf had the chicken lime pasta dish and he hated it. So we munched on my tots (hahahahahahaha sounds hilarious when blurted out loud in a store) and paid the check. There was so much food left over and the server could tell we were not satisfied. Just beware of what you order",

    "text": "I came on Wednesday Havana Nights on their roof top patio, so I cannot speak for any other parts of this big place. There is no cover and the dance lessons are free.  Dance lessons were held from 7 pm - 8:30. Two Latin dances are taught -- the night I was there it was merengue and chacha. The lady instructor was fairly good.  Since the dance area is on the rooftop, this is a venue that is only as pleasant as the outside weather. I have been told that summer dancing is intolerable (the tile floor must get hot enough to burn feet).  The dance floor is sizable but unfortunately is made of a glazed tile. So, don't come there with real dance shoes. It seems that the architects of this place never imagined that people really like to dance. Duh!  Most of the dances that night are salsa but there is also a generous amount of bachata, chacha, and merengue. Fortunately there was almost no free style (without a partner) dance being done. This is a place for partner dancing. Music is done by a DJ and as you might guess is almost entirely Latin.   The crowd was large and at times the floor was very crowded. Ability ranged from total beginner to advanced.   There were all ages but most tended to be in the 20-30 age range. I liked the young ladies because they dressed in skimpy hot pants, short skirts, and high heels. Ooooooooo! La! La!  Drinks were half priced and yet they were very boozy. Can't complain about that!  Unfortunately dancing stops at 11:30. The dance floor was full so I'm puzzled why they stop so early.   Overall this venue is a good salsa scene but I can't give it more than a 3 star because it has serious weaknesses. It seems as though dancing at DB was an afterthought after it was built -- either that or whomever designed it knew nothing about the needs of dancers.",

Went last Saturday night and had the worse experience ever.  Do not put photos of your food on a menu and then deliver something that doesn't come close to looking the same. Ordered nachos from the share menu and the plate was a joke.  Not enough for the group, barely had any chips or toppings, and was garnished with brown guac and Lettuce??? who puts lettuce on nachos. I was mad!  The rest of our food was barely edible, had soggy sliders because of the dumb pickle they put on top, gross!  It was busy so they sat us in banquet overflow, we were hungry so went for it, but bad idea, room was cold and away from everything, and ugly! Of course we went for the games, which is so expensive. Spent a hundred dollars on cards for the kids.  Which last less than 30 minutes.  Underwhelming and will not be going back.",

She apologized and sent a server right over who seemed 'just thrilled' to take our order.  Food arrived twenty minutes later and was okay.

D&B was our second stop; we spent most of our time here because it's awesome!!!! Who doesn't like to kick back, have a few drinks then get crazy playing video games? There are enough games that everyone is pretty spread out and you only have to wait for a game if you really want to play it and someone just started playing. Most of the time if you are waiting to play, people play once then let other people go and keep rotating. It's nice to be in such a cool atmosphere, with music, drinks and video games. It's never too packed when I have gone and the food, service and drinks are affordable and good! It's a nice place to go to have a good time without having to go to multiple places and you are able to beat the hear. Everything you really need is in this one place! One tip, keep your players card, because you can reuse it if you don't use all your credits or your tickets!! Save them for next time! :)  Had a great night! Thanks D&B!",

They're drinks aren't the cheapest, but buying 20oz beers is probably your best bet. They give you a rechargeable token card which can be dangerous since you don't realize how few tokens you have left until you need to buy more. Lol but it's nice because you can store that card in your wallet if you're maxed out on gaming for your next visit, the card doesn't expire.  The guy that works the front counter where you buy your coins is really sweet and tries to get you the best deal for what you're looking to do while your there. (His name is Alex I believe?) While they do have a bar it's a cool place to take kids for some gaming during the day. Haven't had a chance to check out their restaurant unfortunately, but maybe I'll check that out at the next visit.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I LOVE Dave and Buster's. I have been to this location many times and always had a great experience. However, last night was not one of these great experiences. We had a group of 18 that was meeting there for dinner and games to celebrate the birthdays of one of my friends and I. I tried to call ahead and see if we could reserve a table for a specified time and we could not as it is against their policy. The employee that took the call was kind enough to check on wait times with the hostess and I was informed that I should expect a wait time of approximated 30 minutes at my desired arrival time of 4:30 pm. So, I decided to get there a bit early to ensure that the rest of our party would not have to wait to be seated. Upon arrival at 4:15 pm I was told that it would be a 1hour and 45minute wait! I explained that I had called less than two hours earlier and was unable to put in my name for a table but was advised of an approximate wait of 30 minutes. I then asked why, if it is a 1hour and 45minute wait, was I not allowed to put my name in when I called approximately 1hour and 45minutes ago. I also offered the solution of just putting in my name three times for three separate tables of six with the hopes that would at least be near each other. The hostess, whose name I wish I would have gotten (she is slender with blond hair and glasses), proceeded to tell me in a less than friendly moderately condescending tone that they just don't do that and that everyone there had to walk in and wait their turn. She went so far as to start pointing out other tables and telling me their stories. I interrupted her and stated that I was not really concerned with the situations of the other guests. I also let her known that she had a very bad attitude for someone that is working in a service capacity and walked away. She followed after and brought me my buzzer. My husband showed up moments later (he was parking the car and missed the exchange) and within 10 minutes of that our buzzer went off. We made our way back to the hostess stand with my husband leading the way. When he approached the hostess he was friendly, said hello to her, and handed her the buzzer. She was very cold, returned no greeting, and informed us that we were put on the wait list incorrectly and would not actually be seated at that time. I suggested that she just give us three buzzers and put us down on the wait list for three tables of 6, and she did. It was not long before one of our buzzers went off and much to our surprise and delight we were being led to a table that would accommodate our entire party of 18! My husband excitedly thanked the hostess to which she said nothing. I then said, \"you must have a magic wand! Thank you so much!\" To which she said, \"yep\" without an ounce of friendliness but an eye roll and a smirk instead.   There are two reasons that this review is still getting 3 stars:  1) I am basing it on the culmination of experiences that we have had with this location and not just this one isolated incident. 2) Our servers were FANTASTIC! Seriously impressive...I could not thank them enough for the job they did.  I have worked in the service industry in various capacities for 20 years. I have worked as a busser, server, hostess, customer service rep, financial aid advisor, real estate agent, and retail associate. Providing an outstanding and memorable guest/customer experience is something that I love to do and do well. That being said, if I were rating this establishment based on this experience alone it probably would have gotten two stars, due completely to the great wait staff and crazy fun games. Yes, I would remove three stars just for the terrible attitude and interaction of the hostess. She is the first impression and point of contact for the guests. Had I not been a returning customer (I have been a repeat customer of this location for at least 5 years) I probably would have left and taken my party of EIGHTEEN ($$$) elsewhere to celebrate. If this were my first experience I would probably never return here to eat again. Hopefully this woman gains some understanding of her position and job description before she drives away customers that could potentially return and contribute to her paycheck.",

It was a small \"party\" nothing to get overly stressed out about...well, unless you are our server who literally looked like our presence ruined her entire year. It started with showing up to zero organization, no one knowing their head from their..and topped off with our server rolling her eyes, acting put out when we needed something or simply trying to avoid our table at every pass. The \"party\" was supposed to end at 5. There was 4 of us adults sitting at the table continuing to order drinks and spend MONEY when we were informed we needed to leave the table due to a shift change??? We got up, moved all the gifts, etc to another table just to look at our first table sit empty. Shift change? We had the SAME server the entire time even after the move. The best part was while moving all the crap over to the other table I had the pleasure of listening to a couple 20 somethings complaining that we were still there when the party was due to end at 5. My apologizes. Spending money at a place of business was so rude. I asked them in the middle of their complaining if they wanted us to leave, looking stunned they insisted no, however had another girl join in the complaining and continued on. The food sucked, the service was bad at best and the only reason I gave 2 stars was because the manager went out of his way to make up for his staff's ridiculous behavior. Thanks but no thanks, I won't be back. I would suggest main event over this over priced circus.",

We could tell that he was not expecting us to show up at the time we did but, he still did an amazing job. Thank you Dave & Busters for the outstanding costumer service and for being flexible with us throughout the scheduling mix up.",

    "text": "This was a fun arcade to hang out at around happy hour (which ends at 7:00). Upon first arrival, we made our way to the back to what the lady behind the first counter called \"the express bar.\" The bartender in the back told us that even though there are no prices listed on the menu, if we pointed out what we wanted, he could tell us how much they are since he had most of them memorized. I'm the type that likes things listed out before my eyes, but I wasn't particularly picky that night and ended up ordering a passionfruit mojito and a frose. It appeared that most happy hour drinks are around $5.00, which is great, but the drinks are also on the weak side. I don't think I would be happy if I was served those drinks for full price (since they tasted like juice), but for happy hour pricing, I was okay with it. Now I am not much of an arcade person. The last time I went to an arcade in Portland, I hated it. This time I found a game I liked and stuck to it. It was the Star Trek game. This was a very popular game because even grown men were reserving seats around the station for other grown men. It was bizarre. But I spent most of my time here. I found it surprising that all the cards (at least the day I went) were characters from the original series. I am more of a TNG fan, myself, but was happy to score the Sulu card. I'm not at all good at the game and most of our money was spent here, but I noticed some of the kids playing next to me were VERY good. You can tell some people here are regulars. Overall, I would say it was a good experience. Drinks were okay. The service was very friendly though. Both the lady behind the counter at first entrance and the bartender in the back were fantastic!",

The waiter told us the kitchen was behind, but everyone was getting food all around us including people who came after us! We were just about to leave when the waiter finally brought half of us food. Then another 8 minutes passed before he brought the kids their food. Utterly ridiculous. He gave us a power up card, however we had already purchased $80 in game play. It was my nieces birthday and the whole thing was really disappointing. 82 on lunch and 40 in game play, was a hefty price tag for such a horrible experience. (Luckily we had coupons for gameplay)",

I must have not really read the menu, just looked at pics, had no idea shaved brussel sprouts, broccoli slaw and a ton of other shaved veggies would be present...score!! The chicken was chicken,nothing special, its alright though, the dressing was good. I asked for a side of salsa, not a Mexican restaurant so being brought out a side of Pace is acceptable.   The burger my boyfriend ordered was some sort of crazy contraption consisting of fried buffalo chicken, blue cheese, a burger and some other stuff, thing was HUGENORMOUS!and it came with TOTS!!! and they were good!  All in all the food was good/average, it is not a big restaurant, it is a big game place for grown ups so all was acceptable and as expected. We enjoyed our time here eating, drinking and playing games and although probably not something to do all the time, we will be back :)  P.S, I got this margarita corona thing...I liked it :)",

I was in a big group and we all got different things and everyone had complained that the food was bland. Maybe the cook just wasn't at his or her best that day but it was very disappointed. The games were pretty fun! It is a bit hard to find the ones that you earn credits on but they are out there. By the end of the day I spent almost 200$ on just food and gameplay for two people which is excessive considering that other places like Jakes Unlimited you pay a set amount and it's a buffet and your game play instead. Overall not my favorite place but if you like to watch the game out with friends and get down on some video games during half time then the place would be perfect for you. Just expect to pay more than what you thought.",

This is a great place to have a drink and entertain the kids. It's like a bar where children are allowed. SO grab a drink, order an appetizer, play some games, keep an eye on your kid, and make sure you have a DD. I guarantee you'll have a good time.   Oh and if you happen to come here with a big group, I suggest ordering your drinks and food from the bar. It will come faster and you'll avoid the gratuity!",

    "text": "yay for dave and busters.   my wife took me here for a \"pre\" birthday celebration. we only intended to stay an hour or so...because if you're not careful, the spending can rack up at D&B's before you know it.  fast forward 3 hours later and we had to pull ourselves away from some skeeball.  the happy hour specials brought us in. they actually have some pretty good drink specials from 4-7pm for happy hour. i had 2 million dollar margaritas. they were very refreshing and weren't at all soppy sweet mixy tasting. i thought they jipped me on the tequila until i started my second one and i could feel the delicious tequila buzz hitting my fingertips.   we split the make your own shrimp soft taco plate. a hearty meal with 4 tortillas and an assortment of fixins...black beans, rice, guac, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, salsa, and shrimp. i thought they were darn tasty.   then off to the arcade where we played video games...something we only do at D&B's, thus we lose quite quickly and quite often. i love the zombie shoot em ups, the race cars and the air hockey. my gal loves skee ball probably because i suck at it. oh and whack-a-mole...scored serious tickets on that.   there are numerous shoot em up games, basketball, and tons of those fair games where you try to roll a token into an impossibly difficult contraption in order to knock more tokens into a slot to get more tokens...argh, it's too difficult to explain. in the end, you spend about 40 dollars to get tickets in exchange for a glass you could've simply bought at the store for 50cents.   but that's no fun, however, Dave and Busters IS!!!!!!!",

Spinach dip is pretty good-came with thin, warm tortilla chips (just how I like them) and also a small side of salsa. I think the salsa comes from a jar but that's ok because the main part was the spinach dip! As for drinks, I've tried the pina colada, lava flow, and snow cone. Snow cone is one of the crowd favorites there but I think I like lava flow better! I have never had a problem with service! Very professional staff.",

I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place, but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down. I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A, it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose, so you're not necessarily going for the food.  But the cleanliness was horrible. I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of children.  Our waiter was a great help and super nice, but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was, \"Don't worry about it we have someone on it\" . I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way. Don't think I'll be making another trip back, anytime soon.",

So this is now the second bad review I'm going to leave for this devastating service experience once again. Had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes of waiting for the server to show up. As much of a jerk as I sound, I'm a server so I'm more than patient but this is ridiculous on a lazy mildly busy Friday afternoon.

When we got our food, my sons sliders were dried out but he did enjoy the wings. I got a bowl of mac and cheese instead of my alfredo. I told the server about the mistake and he did apologized for it and said he would have my correct order right away. When my food arrived, it looked and tasted good except for the chicken was a little dry.   Definitely a cool place for drinks and entertainment, not so much for the food.",

Not to mention we are celebrating 2 b-days with over 8 people. You would think they can bend the rules a little for such a big party and spending so much money.  Long story short, how much would a silly 20$ play card actually cost d&b to play the games at there establishment. ALMOST nothing thanks to the manager Chelsie. Great customer service? I think not!",

We ordered some drinks from the bar in the back and they were pretty good. I had a berry red bull drink that was just the right amount of alcohol to make the night that much more enjoyable. I enjoyed a variety of games and liked that they had newer stuff out there (new Jurassic Park game was awesome). Overall, it was fun and relaxing. I will definitely check out some of the Dave & Busters in my own area back here in CA soon!",

First the kids mac and cheese plate didnt come with a side. As a whole my daughter doesn't eat much but for the amount of Mac and cheese she received a side would have been nice as she was still hungry asking if she could get another order. Second and the real reason for two two star I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. Now I maybe I'm wrong here but when I picture a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich it is kind of a more than you can handle, mouth watering, how am I going to fit that in my mouth kind of picture. Let's just say that's not what I received. I brought it up to the manager thinking maybe they were short on product or in a hurry and I was informed that it is portioned exactly and that she'd be happy to bring me out some extra meat. Which she did do but what about the cheese and peppers? On the bill she charged me $4.99 for the meat and discounted me a customer discount of $4.80. Over all we will not be dining here in the future.",

It is a great spot for some fun and games for everyone in the family. The kid in me loves going for some fun. The games we play on our cells are now larger, more interactive and a lot more fun. Games we would play with regular household items are now score keeping and setup just for us. Kids will have a blast, my son always does. There is tons to do and play to keep kids occupied and happy for a few hours.   The place has food, drinks and games galore so its great for a night out with some friends or a nice, cool spot to take the kids. The one at desert ridge has a bowling alley and area for parties. Great place for company get togethers and social mixers.   Only downfall was the super slow service at the restaurant. We got there and there was only two tables sat but we waited almost 30 min for a salad and pretzel dogs. We had to ask about it twice before our food finally came. If it was busy thats one thing but with only 2 tables before us it shouldn't take 30 min to get out an app salad and 3 mini pretzel dogs.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to any Dave & Busters since we don't have them in the Reno area.  I went with my son, his friend and a friend of mine during a trip out of town to the Tempe area.  The place is huge and pretty exciting when you first enter with a bar in front, games in the rear and dining area on both sides of the bar.  It appears that the right side of the dining area (which is closed off to games) is more for folks who want to just eat and sit away from the gaming action.  The rest of the tables are either bar-side or right next to all of the games.    The hostess took a good amount of time being nice and explaining the \"pay and play\" specials and other options we had.  I ended up buying a $12.00 playing card (which I think loaded up 48 \"chips\") and ordering off the menu.  They have a pretty varied menu although it really is just more creative \"sports bar\" food with a tad higher price.  I ended up splitting a burger with my friend - don't remember the name but it was a beef patty with buffalo chicken strips on it and onion straws on top.  (Yeah - you read that right).  My son got a mushroom burger and asked for no onions.  He and I also split the spinach dip.   Feelings on food changed  during the course of our visit.  My friends soup came out cold twice and once she finally got a hot one she didn't care for it - too salty.  My son loved his burger (even though he had to pick the onions off since they didn't see the \"no onion\" request).  The spinach dip was very good.  The burger my friend and I split was tasty although dry so we got a side of Frank's sauce.  My friend later got sick but I was fine so maybe it was her soup?  Our waiter was very busy and seemed very new - he was also very nice so I personally didn't much mind the small mistakes because he felt so bad about it.  They have a HUGE variety of games.  I just glanced around but saw everything under the sun.  They evven have a horror game that monitors your heart rate!!! (Say WHAT!?)  The ticket redemption center is not like most arcades with a bar of toys an angry teenager behind it.  This was huge and more like a store of goodies than anything else.  You can walk around and touch/feel and pay with the prizes before you commit to spending your tickets.  When all was said and done I had spent $42.00.  That total included 2 drinks, 2 entrees (1 split), 1 appetizer and 54 game chips.  I didn't think that was bad at all and I would go again for sure!   Final thoughts:  1 - I don't love the limited options to re-load the card.  My son only needed 6 more chips to play the game he wanted to at the end of the day and since the re-load machine doesnt offer 6 chips I had to use my debit card twice to get 3 more chips twice.  That was annoying.  2 - The have a huge beer........it's cool.........it's like a big mini keg and holds about 8 beers. I think it costs around $30.00.  I want it.  3 - I seriously wanna get a group of adults to this place and drink and play games.  That is all.",

Female waitress looked disappointed in the first waiter and she went and got the coffee. The male waiter ended up serving a table next to us (not sure what we did for the male waiter to not serve  us). I would give 5 stars for the female waitress. 2 stars is for the rude male waiter.",

Was told by our sever that they were short staffed. I did not see the acting manager assisting this poor guy who was trying to deliver 11-12 families their drinks/food. I was not impressed with my food at all. One member of our group ordered an appetizer and it was never delivered. She walked out. Don't eat here. Just stick to the games and eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "Being that I am a fan of food and video games what better than to combine them both in one building. A couple buddies and I were a little bored on a week night and pondered about what we can do. We were tired of sitting around the house playing video games and drinking so we decided to go to Dave and Busters. We first ate and had some drinks before we hit the games. I ordered the chicken tenders meal thing with the power play card thingy. It was decently priced but just mediocre in the taste department. I've had McDonald's chicken strips that were equally good but McDonalds doesn't have the gaming area that Dave and Busters has, or alcoholic beverages either. So after kickin a few back we decided it was time to play a few games. Of course, as a bunch of young guys, we turned everything into a competition. We shot some hoops, which i dominated, and played the football game too. I wasn't so good at the football game. Who knew throwing a football into a small circle would be so difficult, may have had something to do with the excessive drinking beforehand or so id like to think. They have a variety of fun games to play which is made more fun by the consumption of alcohol. I would definitely recommend this place for a slow but fun weekday night, but expect not to have gourmet cuisine made by Emeril Legasse.",

I went with some coworkers and their spouses.  We chose D&B because we thought it would a fun way to bond as a team.  We started off with dinner. The menu looked promising for American style food.... and then it came out.  Nothing was tasty, not even the French fries, who screws up French fries?  Okay, so we didn't go there for the food we went there for the games and such.  We were told that it was an adult atmosphere, and by adults,  I can only assume they meant over  13?  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait.  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party.  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch.",

The only downside was that my server automatically supercharged my card so it was $21.99 for me.  I ate 3 sets and got a few wings to take home too. Overall it was a great experience. I never waited a long time for my wings. Nor did I encountered any attitudes for wanting more wings. I played a few games and transferred the rest of chips to my main card.

Don't come expecting the moon.  Remember the good ol' days when you could play for hours at Peter piper if your mom forked out a five. Times have changed. To get a solid hour of play time here you'll need at least $20. I'm on their emailing list and they frequently offer buy 20 get 20 for game points which is the way to go.  They have so many cool new games! Including a virtual reality Jurassic Park game. You literally wear the cool thing that goes around your head and everything. Other game highlights are Mario kart & giant pac man.  Sure it's expensive, but it's not the 90s anymore and playing games here with vodka tonics is way more fun than mediocre games at cheaper spots.",

This isn't a food joint, so I expected edible food, but nothing great.  The bartender seemed shocked I had ordered food at all. Whatever, I figured, they can't screw up tater tots and a salad. Even the sleepiest side of the road diners can properly furnish me with a salad that isn't wilting, falling apart and missing croutons.   I sent the salad back, as the leaves themselves were gross enough that they wouldn't even have passed muster as food for my bugs at home.  The poor bartender explained they'd lost their chef to a new, terrible manager. The man said he was embarrassed by the food! I hope the poor guy has found a new job by now, this review is a bit late as I didn't want to get the poor man in trouble.   Two stars because the games were chill, cocktails were good. Just don't get food",

I'm a gluten-free vegan so finding food at chain restaurants is extremely challenging, especially with celiac which means cross contamination is an issue. However, they did have some guacamole and chips I was able to order. And they were very careful (even putting a shield over the tray upon delivery) with my guacamole to avoid any dairy contamination (also and allergy). That part of the service I was grateful for. The chips, guacamole and salsa were all really good as well as the two drinks I ordered (Walk the Plank), also great.   The rest of the service however was super, super slow. Everything was a wait, from placing an order to receiving food/drink.  I'm not sure if they were super busy and short staffed (it was Saturday night) and we had eight in our party, but even the water took about 20mins to get. At some point there was a statement that desert should have been ordered \"an hour ago\" so the rest of my party would have had it after their dinner. The arcade was cool, but if I'd known what I know now I'd have suggested dinner elsewhere.",

When are we are going to go!?!?\" and I guess I should have known from her luke warm reaction (which was a look that said \"ahhh YOU can go anytime YOU want\") that it sounded much better on paper than in reality.  The first time I entered the door the overwhelming sports theme was so obnoxious that I just couldn't handle it and I turned around and left.  Last night my (beautiful) date was up for bar food and this was our only option.  And what do you know?  First impressions do matter! And sometimes you CAN judge a book by it's cover.  I had a $20 steak which was tough, fatty and included NO FRIES/POTATOES and NO SALAD!  Not exactly a great value.  Plus it sucked ass.  That said, I've got to say, my favorite part of the experience was, that even though this place is a huge cheesy sports bar full of harmless bright shinny suburban clones ... for some reason, management feels the need to have, not one, not two, not three but FOUR fat bouncers to greet you at the door.  A very scary place indeed!  **  FYI, if your the type that likes the genre of big shinny sports an/ or dance bars ... you really need to discount this, and all of my Yelps!  Clearly this place is popular (or it wouldn't be a corporate chain).",

We got prime seating over at the end of the deck, away from all of the noise from the other parties. It was perfect temp for being outside and having some drinks with friends. Live music was playing below which was a nice touch but it was a little too loud at times, the band was just okay.   I did not have any food on this visit but my friends had ordered some nachos which were covered in way too much guacamole making them soggy very quickly. My other experiences with food here have been not the best so they lose a couple of stars here. The drinks were pretty good. I just had wine so I can't say to many bad things about wine but a couple of my girlfriends had fruity cocktails which they said tasted like sugar water, yuck. My guy friends had blue moon and bud draft which was good. Overall drinks and food are just mediocre.  We did not play games on this recent trip but that is always a good time especially after some drinks. It looks as if they have added some new games recently so I might be back in a few weeks to give them a spin.",

First the waitress brought me the wrong beer and proceeded to argue with me saying that it wasn't the wrong one. Then we waited for over an hour for our food. The whole time our waitress stopped by and asked if we were ok twice. She never offered a reason to why it was taking so long. After her stopping by to ask if we needed anything else, we told her we never even received our food. She went back and said that they were still making it. We had to flag her down to tell her that we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. She then took more of our time to get the check processed. We still ended up paying for our drinks and the floor leader never once stopped by to apologize for the wait. She \"comped\" us with game cards for the video games. We turned those in to the front desk and the girl at the front was no better. When we said we were not coming back because of the terrible service she just said ok. I'd say save your money and go to a location that actually cares about their customers.",

I liked how there were tvs pretty much everywhere, especially as this was a football night. When we sat down, we were greeted promptly. We ordered a few drinks to start and were given menus. It seemed that it took her a bit longer than it should have to get the beverages. Once we finally decided what we were going to eat, we wanted to order but she was no where to be found. We actually had to wait for the waitress...haha.  When we got the chance, I ordered the turkey burger that came with bacon, lettuce, tomato on a whole wheat bun. I chose to get a side of steamed veggies instead of fries to be a bit healthier. My kids got a hamburger and grilled chicken with fries. My family got tacos and grilled salmon. I was throughly impressed with my burger and the rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food as well.  So overall, the food was not what I expected in a good way, the service was slow and lack luster, but I enjoyed the sporty ambiance with all the tvs. Not a bad place to be for some casual time.",

The food did come out vey quick which was nice but it wasn't anything special it just was good to balance out the alcohol.

First we call ahead to make sure it's not going to be busy and to see if they do anything for birthdays, they told me it would be slow and they would do a dessert. Get there and it is nice and slow, they tell us to sit at the bar area all the way in the back past the arcade, get back there and can't find any kind of server but once we do they tell us to go sit in the lounge up front. They tell us our server will be with us soon, 10 or more minutes pass, no one at all, barely any tables but 5 or 6 servers are standing near by all chatting and just staring at us, two workers were evening cuddling and kissing each other! Our server greets us and I explain it's my boyfriends birthday, doesn't even say happy birthday just seems annoyed. Was grumpy the entire meal with us and I asked him twice for a dessert and then also asked who I figured was a manager for the dessert they had told us my boyfriend would get for his birthday. Finally after sitting forever after our meal wanting to be playing games not sitting, it finally comes. Then we go play games where multiple we're not working and were taking our money and then malfunction, went to the front to claim the free rewards I had in my email and the worker gave me attitude. Just all in all an overall crappy experience.",

    "text": "I've never been to one so I went in for my birthday. The price of the games are normal for larger arcades but the selection is a bit odd. I understand that it's originally geared towards adults but having a TON of casino-style machines (where you play chance with tokens or for tickets without any real skill involved) and only about 30-40% playable games is annoying. If I wanted to play games for coin, I'd go to an actual casino. They had some games that were free (limited time, I'm sure) and a few of the classics but overall, the choices are rather limited.   After a bit of game, we decided to eat here as well. Got The Boss Chicken Club ( grilled chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, creamy garlic-herb cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado/mayo spread and fried onions on a toasted whole-wheat bun) with fries which was really good. Also, they have Angry Orchard (the best domestic hard cider I've tried) on tap (with two different oz. sizes) which is definitely worth some bonus points in my book.  Also, the guy gave us a free brownie with a candle for my birthday without making a big deal about it which was awesome.   A major thing thing that annoyed me what the distribution of staff. I hope a game doesn't break on you because it's practically impossible to find someone to help. The photobooth ate our photos so I went up to the front counter to ask for someone with keys to open it up. There was a short line but the guy didn't even acknowledge me - a simple \"Just a moment.\" would have been more than appreciated instead of just ignoring my existence. What I assume was the manager finally looked away from the TV controller after about 5 -10 minutes of me standing there to ask if I needed something. They need more people operating the floor instead of the staff being mostly wait staff in the food area. There was also a missing puck in the air hockey game but since there was no one around to help, we couldn't be bothered again and shrugged it off as a loss.  Overall, come for a nice dinner if you don't mind the noise and want to play some games - but if you're here for the arcade, definitely go to Gameworks or (for the pinball aficionados like myself) Castles and Coasters instead. Way better selections there.  3 stars for good food quality and fair prices but with poor game selection and service.",

It is in the center of Tempe Marketplace, very easy to find and right next door to the outdoor stage area. This is a nice area to hang outside if you get claustrophobic or just need a break from arcade-land.   As far as the venue, it's a pretty massive area. Bar, billiards, televisions and restaurant are up front; games and Carnie prizes are towards the back. The games only accept credits by way of a \"Power Card\", which needs to be reloaded at various kiosks around the floor. It is disturbingly similar to a Casino... and if you aren't careful, you can blow thru money nearly as fast. I like to negotiate a predetermined amount with my kids before entering the field. Fail to do this, and suffer the eventual sugarcrash-neon-meltdown. You've been warned.  Regarding their party planning service. This is my favorite part of DnB. I have now had two birthday kids parties here with my son's and a few adult graduation/birthday events.  It is such a fantastic venue! The staff really takes care of you. Just book your time slot, confirm number of people and show up. The decor/food/entertainment is all taken care of. There are different packages for any budget and they are very accommodating. If desired, you can bring in outside cake or additional decor. The only challenge is herding the kids, for young birthday parties. I recommend only parties with children old enough to \"return to base\". There are also semi-private rooms with large televisions, perfect for an adult or team party. Plus, the booze. Duh.  Really, nothing negative to say..  a rarity.",

Now...they come in a small, non-fancy glass, but...they get the job done. Luckily I only needed one because I apparently got the last \"Coronarita lid\" so they couldn't sell any more after that. Maybe they should consider the special clips most places use. They're inexpensive and reusable. Just sayin'.  Anyway...this last Friday we went back for dinner, and some of that Coronarita action. This time we were able to get seated in the dining area. That sounds like a good thing right? Yeeeeeah...No.   We were seated in a creepy mirrored booth by an unfriendly hostess. Our menus were sticky and dirty...had to pry some of the pages apart like a high school boy's porno mag. Gross. Then...we sat. And we sat. And we watched servers walk by over and over...not even giving us a glance...for well over 10 minutes. We made our drink and dinner decisions...and nobody came to take an order. So...we finally just left and had a fabulous steak dinner at The Keg. :)    So...I generously give 2 stars because the first visit was okay. That second time though...only good thing about it was that we got to discover a very tasty steakhouse and try something new due to the lack of...well...anything besides being seated.",

The food was reasonable, filling and comparable to a Denny's or Applebee's dining experience.  The games were reminiscent of a chuck e cheese, Peter piper pizza, etc. not many games for adults. I \"played\" a shooting game, paying for the required credits and was displeased to find that the gun did not work and the game abruptly ended as I was unable to defend myself against the enemy. I played several other games accumulating minimal amounts of \"tickets.\" At the end of my visit I was unable to redeem my tickets for anything appealing or desirable. I will probably not visit this establishment again. Thank you.",

I went to the bar first and got a shot, but kind of took a minute for them to get it to us. Well, after that everyone showed up and we got seated quickly. Our waiter's name was Kendal and dude was nice, polite, and professional. I didn't have to wait long for my drink to get filled up so that's a PLUS!   For food,  I ordered the ribs and wings. Wings were alright, nothing over the top. The ribs on the other hand was very moist and juicy with every bite, I was pleasantly surprised by that. After that we went into the arcade. Played some basketball. They also had a sand board game which was cool and little pool hall next to it. So, its a nice place to come and play some games and just relax with good company!",

On a Thursday evening we came in looking for a table for 6, 20 servers and NOT A SINGLE ONE could care enough help us find a table.  An ENTIRE half of the resturant empty with a sign \"Please wait to be seated\", for what?   Seriously, at happy hour they couldnt spare to have someone coordinate tables?? Waiters and waitresses who are cluelesss and/or don't care.  How much does a simple sign cost to tell if a table is still occupied -  I can make one on my home printer!  Best part is the front saying \"Thanks for coming\" as we we're walking out!    Cant even say how good the food was or the experience.  Not surprised to find only 3 stars here.  Good luck if you dare.  Maybe the lunch team cares more.",

Most of time though my eyes are on the big beautiful TV's over the bar. The bar is my favorite hangout spot. There are often great drink specials, especially during Happy hour.  Service has always ranged from good to great. The bartenders usually take good care of us across the counter. I really like the food at this Dave and Busters but that cant be said about the other locations I have been to.  This is a great spot to bring the crowd or just a few friends. There is lots to do, and everyone seems to be having a great time. I need to hit up the craft beer night on the upper patio.",

I will definitely be back to win more prizes since the \"ticket\" games are incredibly addicting. I also do appreciate the cleanliness and the spacing of all of the games. The games themselves are also periodically updated, so that it doesn't get boring! The addition of the virtual reality ride also was a nice touch.  The only qualm I have about D&B in general is that once in a while, the games do glitch up, and finding an employee may be challenging at times. All in all, D&B is definitely worth a visit - Just make sure you have a good budget though!",

The game was showing on limited screens so we asked to sit at a table with a good view which was dirty so I politely asked the waitress if she could clean it so we could sit there. She I guess took it as disrespect and said with some real attitude \"what's wrong with the table behind it?!\" We finally get seated and are there for 2 and a half hours and maybe see her 3 times. Every time the order of wings come they are cold like they been sitting there for a long time which is weird cuz there was only 3 tables occupied  in the whole place including ours smh. Not to mention the unlimited wins deal is sorry. ONE free ranch for all the wings you can eat each other ranch is 65 cents. You can't even choose a flavor it's only one. Probably won't be going back to this place.",

My beef is with the food and service.    First, we only ordered appetizers, which should take ten minutes or less.  Wrong.  They easily took 25 or more.  Then the \"loaded\" potstickers were basically ling ling potstickers from Costco with a little sesame oil drizzled on them with green onions.  And, you only get four.  What a hose.   Then, the guacamole was completely void of taste.  It didn't even taste like avocado...... it tasted like nothing at all.  I told the server and she just said basically sometimes their guacamole is gross.  Then, she went back and told the kitchen and the cook responded by saying he knew it would be gross, he didn't put any salt in it.  Why she told me that, I don't know.  So, they serve subpar food and they know it.......weird.",

They don't charge for their Air Conditioning.  Location was a pretty typical D&B layout, lots of different variety of games, seems like they generally place the larger interactive hoops, skeeball, carnival games on the outer edges, more video games centralized.  Plenty of walking space between and around games, and lots of flashing lights to woo the children - and some adults.  As with all of them, I kind of miss the instant gratification of rewards (machine spitting  out a couple tickets), but I get it - we should be going green.  But how about some alarms and more flashing lights?  Good entertainment for the family and even for about an hour of playing you can still find your way to the WIN zone and redeem your winnings for small trinkets.  We did have an issue with a game, and could not find anyone walking around to help us, eventually we just gave up.",

The service and support we experienced from general manager Trent Averhoff and his team for the Chandler Little League All-Stars pictures was amazing.  Not only did they open early for 20 teams, coaches and parents, but they made the 2 hours of herding kids around to picture stations very easy and organized. His staff was on point making sure tired parents and hungry kids were taken care of.   As a business owner who hosts parties for his staff and children's events often, I have experience the full spectrum of service levels at different venues. This by far was one of the best and will keep me planning events here in the future.   Great job to Trent and his team. Thank you for taking such great care of us.",

The machine wasn't working with the card they had. He was just walking around the whole night making sure everyone was having a good time.   Turns out it was a pizza ranch refill card they were using. He wore a smile and acted like he wanted to be there. He didn't try to make fun of them or crack up like I would of, and did after it all.  He was so cool about it and even gave them a bonus. Joel quickly extinguished the frustration and continued to check on us.   It was pretty busy but they had great food. My wife didn't even complain. Usually she's does so that means it was good! My cheese steak with double cheese was on point.   I'm way too busy to be writing a review these days but it was well worth the visit. Thanks for helping out Joel! You made my night. It's hard to find people people that make a difference.",

And within this place you find ample seating for a open air indoor restaurant, a large bar area, a smaller secondary walk-up bar towards the back. There are so, so many TVs. Playing all sorts of different sporting events as well as some random videos from the 1980s, Christmas, current? Wasn't quite sure what that randomness was about. But seeing Run DMC it's Christmas in Hollis was funny.   Everything was decent.  Food and Bevs:Our waiter, Tom, was very attentive. I appreciate the restaurant manager stopping by randomly to ask how everything was. Both explained all the different choices off the menu and that you could also do the meal/game card combo pack and save money. Every day there is some kind of special. Since we visited on a Wednesday, all the games were half off. There are also happy hour drink specials until 7 PM. Food was tasty. Lots of menu choices. I had a steak salad and my friend had a Philly cheesesteak sub with fries. I had a Tito's and cranberry and my friend had a Hurricane drink. After we finished our dinner and our waiter told us we could walk around with our drinks if we wanted, we went over to the arcade section.  Arcade: They had plenty of different kinds of games. Some old fashioned fair games. And it was great to see some of the 80s classic made into large digital video machines. Like Pac-Man! Super Mario kart! Hey Ghostbusters, Star Wars and plenty of first shooter games. There was also a virtual reality Jurassic Park Experience but that was extra. There were plenty of interactive games such as Connect Four, motorcycle, something called lightning speed, basketball hoops, skee ball, ping-pong, keyboard, the Claw, Danceatron., Air Hockey. You name it. We saw plenty of families walking around, young couples, some teens and college students. There weren't too many younger children which was nice. It was a fun vibe. However it gets very, very loud. And you purchase points that go on a game card. On a regular night I could see burning through a lot of money rather quickly. They make it very easy to reload your card. Ha ha There are also game team leaders which are always on the floor in case a game isn't working correctly or something goes wrong with your card. They were super helpful and reloaded some extra points to our card when the game we were playing on malfunctioned. You earn digital Tickets which you can turn in for prizes. Of course they have some low point prizes such as candies and other tchotchkes but they also had some pretty cool items you could earn such as a Keurig coffee maker, cool stuffed animals and other gear. Your ticket points and any leftover game credits that you haven't used will stay on your card until the next time.They can be used at any Dave &Busters location. You can also rent out large party rooms that have their own D&B catering staff For work meetings, birthdays, any other celebratory events. Etc.",

As a group in our late 20's and early 30's, I was hesitant at first thinking we wouldn't mix in well with the younger crowds; however, alcohol was our saving grace! Go straight to the bar in the back and go before 7pm where mix drinks are half-off! Wednesdays are even better when games are also half off. Overall, this is a very adult friendly place to hang out with friends, drink, and play a few games. I'm giving 3 stars for the full price experience. I would not recommend eating or drinking during non-happy hour times b/c the full price is not worth it. The drinks are fairly dilute as I barely felt the 2 drinks I had ordered.",

After work we got our two year old daughter and headed out here to blow off steam before packing a long weekend. We arrive to sit in the dining area. After 20 minutes with no service we decided to head out. Multiple times servers passed our table, had the time to talk amongst themselves or even take orders of those seated after ourselves! We stopped by the front desk to make sure it's still open seating. We have hosted numerous parties here and the Desert Ridge location. So we are aware of the ins and outs of the facility. The girl at the front asked when we arrived and I told her about 20 minutes ago. We went straight to a table to hopefully eat before we hit the games as we have a two year old and lets be honest- planning to spend hours here so these parents want a drink!!! She apologized and and offered to grab someone. I told her NO, as I don't plan on spending the rest of my night at the leisure of those who work here. We have a toddler and already waited 20 minutes at a table. I suppose their employees are hired to work at their leisure- not the other way around! So we left! They lost a huge sale- not for just dinner, drinks but also hours in gaming.",

    "text": "Location 5/5:  Love Tempe Marketplace and it is a wise idea to have a concept like this in the area.  Between ASU, Families, and Tourists this place must consistently be busy.  I was able to play some games, and then do some shopping.  Concept/Games 4.5/5:   Super jealous we do not have one of these in Vegas.  It seems like a perfect fit.  I loved the mix of arcade and carnival games.  If you are a huge gamer you may not be in love with the selection of games, but I could have spent all day trying to earn virtual tickets.  Sure most of the prizes are your basic stuffed animals and branded merchandise, but it is still fun trying to each the goal.  Also tons of tv's with sports.  Come football season or the World Series I may need to visit.  Food/Drink 1.5/5  This for me was the only real low point of my visit.  I order the Goldfingers as part of the Eat and Play Combo. The chicken was the rubberiest thing I have ever tried to have eaten.  It was essentially inedible.  I can see why they can afford to charge so little for them as part of the combo.  I loved my watermelon shaved ice drink, but will need to try something different next time or just stick to drinks and games.  Price 4/5: I found the prices to be reasonable.  At the end of the day your are paying for the concept, and the chance to win prizes.  I could see where some of the games could been seen as slightly overpriced, but all in all worth the money.  Overall 4/5:  Loved hanging out here.  Plan on coming back.  I just may choose to eat at one of the other restaurants in Tempe Marketplace.",

There's even a cute \"If they made it\" similator, which will show you what your future kid will look like based on you and your date's profiles (Sadly, based on our results, maybe adoption would be best haha).   I've been to several Dave and Buster's locations, and this one is decent. One thing I've noted is that over the years, at least for my tastes, the prizes don't seem as nice now.",

It was late in the evening, and the friendly barkeep greeted is with a warm smile and a hello. I was delighted to see that they have Impossible Burgers on the menu. This kind of forward thinking menu choice really speaks to DB's commitment to both the environment and our bovine friends. The burger was delicious, as were the accompanying French fried potatoes. I had me some of the biggins. After our meal, we retired to the gaming arena. We spent the next hours racing, shooting hoops, and having a generally raucous good time. The games were a real hoot!

    "text": "Got invited by friends, they had some \"unlimited play\" cards and I had not been to an arcade in a while, so it sounded fun. Guess what, the cards only work on about 1/4 of the games they have there (all games have color-coded scanners: red, green and blue... the cards ONLY work on the blue ones). So basically you have Pac-Man, Basketball, Air Hockey, a couple of shooters and a couple of racers... not much variety for an \"unlimited\" situation. Several such machines were out of order due to lack of maintenance and worse still, the cards could only be swiped every so often... like I was playing the basketball game (which is pretty short, the timer lasts maybe 45 seconds or so) and when I go swipe the card again it says \"Sorry, you have to wait another 20 seconds to do that again). Um, ok... not great for an \"unlimited\" situation. After a couple hours of mostly just walking around, playing a game here or there, we were really bored with the lack of options.   We decided to go get a table, order some drinks and just hang out for a little bit together. I saw Guinness on the beer menu so I ordered an Irish Car Bomb (basically a pint of Guinness with a shot on the side (1/2 Irish Cream and 1/2 Irish Whiskey). I hadn't had one of those in a while so I was excited... until it came. They filled a full-size beer glass with about 1 inch of beer (the fill line was lower than the shot glass). I said no... there's got to be a mistake here (I have never had an Irish Car Bomb with that little Guinness before, ever) and the waiter says NOPE, that's just how it is... he double checked with the bartender. I refused the drink and just got a beer instead.   I mean from a business / cost perspective, what's better... throwing out completely good Irish Cream, Irish Whiskey and an inch of beer just to sell a cheaper $6 glass of beer, or just filling the dang glass with some Guinness like you're supposed to and selling the $9 drink the customer actually ordered? I'm still shaking my head at that one.   Overall, this place was a dud.",

Another 20 for the wings.  They give you 5 wings and some fries. Asked for ranch when we ordered. Didn't come with it. Asked the rubber if we could get some. He said \"Yeah, your server has to put in an order for it.\"  Even though we had already asked for it upon ordering, now we were forced to sit waiting for ranch to be ordered. Put in an order for another serving. 20 minutes, Ok maybe more like 15, we asked, hey, did you get more wings in for our table? \"Yep, they should be out in a minute.\" 10 minutes more, amd here come the wings. Go ahead... Put in another order. Another 15 minutes, another \"they're on their way\". 15 more minutes, here come the wings...   Don't get me wrong. The wing sauce was yum! The fries were good and fresh. They had about 15 tables going with what looked like 3 servers and about 4-5 others helping to run food. It was 7:30 so not very busy.   Ok, we're done and ready to play some games! All you can play card in hand, and off we go. Scan first machine... No credits. Hmm... That's weird. Our server said they were ready. Scan second machine. Nope.. Go back ask ask server. \"Oh, it's only the non ticket games. The ones with the blue on it.\" Ok... So not necessarily all you can play. Got it. There are maybe 5-7 games that are blue. I think we were able to play 2 of them. So to play other games, gotta put money on the card. So now I'm in for another $50.   I guess we could've gone and had wings somewhere else, then just paid $50 for games. It would have been much cheaper, and probably less hassle on getting served.",

A few doors down, Dave opened an outrageous place for entertainment and games where adults were irresistibly drawn for fun. The two young guys  noticed people rotating between their establishments, and an idea started to form. They joined the two concepts together.   DAVE & BUSTER'S IS A PROUD SUPPORTER OF MAKE-A-WISH AND HAS RAISED OVER $6 MILLION SINCE 2012 FOR CHILDREN WITH LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESSES  So now my review: Their Mac and cheese is amazing and delicious. Please try it. They offer many choices of food Items. Each have different size portions which is good. If you like to drink come here. They offer many different drink options. Cheap to expensive.   Yes it is loud but just speak louder. Their games are fun and I really like the old school games. You do not have to play games to have fun here. Everyone talks to each to each other. They have many televisions to watch football etc.. great location and venue. But parents please watch your kids. I know you're having fun and think this is a babysitting place and you can just ignore your children, but Please don't.",

    "text": "Last minute gettogether to celebrate my buddies birthday and all he's about is playing games. What better way then get everyone (adults and kids) together stress-free at the last minute and get some good food, cocktails and most importantly play some games. Eat & Drink first and the games shall follow.   When I learned I was coming, I did what everyone else probably does, reaches into that shoebox or kitchen drawer of game cards from years ago hoping to find some magical points, tickets or money loaded to extend the night. I had 6 cards....   Time to eat.. we were undecided on the apps, so we went with the Fives All Around which included 5 of everything (Chicken Wings, Chicken Quesadilla with what I think was salsa and then these 5 Pretzel hot dogs and pretzel pieces that actually were pretty good)  When it comes to dinner the best bang for your buck are the eat & play combos. I went with the Caveman Combo which included ribs, sliders, and fries while others ventured with the Crispy Nashville Hot chicken or took the healthy route with the grilled chicken and kale salad. As far as cocktails, I stuck with my Mule (which was good) and the birthday boy went with the Green Ghost (Crown & apple whiskey) in which it comes with a green glowing cube (that we kept) followed by the Strawberry Watermelon Margarita (which also had a glow cube in it). The drinks were good but more entertaining if you ask me. Then again, when we shifted to games, I think that's when it all kicked it... the liquor that is...   Variety of games are cool and you will find yourself swiping like crazy when it comes to games that say \"you have 10 seconds to continue\"... Overall experience can be fun, a bit pricey, but where else can you find an 8ft Rock'em Sock em game delivering blows. If you're going on a budget, don't... just embrace and have fun. 3.5 Rating overall...",

The queso was too salty and burned our mouths, the bean dip had good flavor but too runny, and the guacamole was perfect. I ordered the summer special asian salmon with white rice and sauteed veggies. I liked my entire meal, it was very good. The salmon was a tad dry but honestly, I'd rather have it served too done than not cooked enough so all was well in my book. Our waitress was great. It took a while to get our food but not too long and it was piping hot. The games area was nice, very clean, as were the restrooms. Lots of fun to be had, all the games were in working order. We ended up spending 3 hours, not realizing how much time had passed since we were having a good time.",

Wonderful outdoor shopping mall, clean, well kept, and perfect for families.  Came on a weekday evening during Spring Break, and there were other few families. There were a lot of date night couples, but it wasn't too much were our kids (ages 8 &11) were in their way. D&Bs is definitely a family favorite, as it's an arcade the whole family can enjoy.",

Kudos to Corina for stepping in and helping me tweak our menu. The night of Cody and his team were amazing. We wanted for nothing...the service was among the best I have experienced...and I gave been planning employee events for 20 years! If you have an event to plan, big or small...let the folks at Dave and Buster's Tempe take care of you, you won't regret it. And don't forget to add the Churro Desert Bar to your menu!!!",

The rest of the food appeared decent, nothing to write home about and not fancy, just average. My guests ate everything but the only thing they commented on being good was the meatballs.  I was disappointed that there were NO vegan options on the menu at all, not what we served but on the actual menu.  I ordered an impossible burger lettuce wrapped to go as the buns had dairy and it. It came with Cheese on it so I had to throw it away. I had specified vegan. Btw - cheese is not vegan. Is it that hard?",

The first time was upstairs outside so it was pretty hot lol. Last night was inside first floor to the right. It was pretty cool actually. I was surprised with how loud the music was blasting last night inside. I just wanna say thank you for hosting us though every Tuesday for country swing dancing. Country swing dancing is one of my fav things to do and I'm just glad y'all are one of the places willing to host us and let us dance around and blast our country music loud inside and give us an unending amount of water hahah. And providing us with fans whether it's outside or inside. It is very much appreciated.",

I've only been to this location twice the last past two Sundays in a row for football ( go patriots by the way lmao) The first Sunday I sat at an actual table and the waiter clearly was annoyed and came over to us way too many times asking the same questions I had to tell this guy 20 times in 3 minutes that I wasn't ready to order and after we did order he still kept coming almost like he was rushing us to get more stuff. I'll break here by saying I'm not cheap by any means I travel the world and go to many restaurants or bars I have no issue spending money however if I say I'm good then I'm good if I'm there for football im probably gonna spend eventually relax you'll get you're money lol anyways at least he did his job even though it seemed all for the wrong reasons and not customer service reasons this moves me to my next experience this past weekend. Came this past Sunday and this time me and my girlfriend sat at the bar I asked the girl behind the bar (blonde hair wearing an eagles shirt don't know her name ) which tv they had the patriots game on she looked directly at me and didn't say anything like I was speaking Chinese or something. When she finally came to us for drink orders she had an attitude and kept this attitude the whole time took my food order and didn't even ask my girl what she wanted just walked away lol I still bought like 6 drinks and food once again I spend money with no issues. Actually everyone behind the bar looked unhappy to be there and customer service sucked. As I said the food was good, they have big TVs everywhere that show all the games and also they give military discounts which I do credit since I'm a service member. I'll be back this Sunday again and will post a follow up review.",

We walked in and immediately were cut in line by another group, but we're fine with it due to we had no idea how many power cards we needed. We ended up doing the four cards for 100$, which seemed like a good deal.   We decided to eat first, so we sat in the bar area and were helped about 5 minutes after sitting down. We ordered drinks and asked about pricing due to not seeing any listed. Margaritas run from 9-15$, which seems hiked up. We ordered three appetizers as well to share amongst us, which took awhile to get.   One of the items we ordered, the pepperoni pretzel bites, came out cold. It seemed like all they did was reheat an old batch. We sent it back, and less then 5 minutes later received a new one. Luckily this one seemed better but was still off putting. Our waitress was friendly, although some of the conversation we had with her was to much information about her.   We started to play games and noticed that a lot of the games were broken down or just flat out not working. We told some of the staff of the ones that we've found and they seemed uninterested. Would most likely recommend going to another location to splurge.",

They hold special paperview events here (UFC, boxing,etc ). Lots of TVs for sport enthusiasts! This place also has a rooftop bar thats a lot more quiter than the downstairs (unless there is live music out front ), but its not always open....I am thinking only on the weekends????!?!! You can rent out one of their rooms for any function you may have ( bridal shower, birthdays, team building, etc ). If you sign up online and register your card, you get $10.00 of free play money to spend on games all the time. When you use your card on drink and food purchases you accumulate points for free and discounted stuff ! They also have specials, but you have to go online to check them out !",

The layout of the place keeps it from being congested when busy. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because there were a lot of machines that were broken throughout the night.  They have also removed the button where you can call an attendant to the game you're at, so if there is an issue, you have to go find them yourself.  With that being said,  there weren't attendants walking the game floor looking to help people so you had to go find a server to call someone to the game.",

With 20 balls to throw total, we have 1450 points after 19 balls. Averaging 75 points(76.31) per ball thrown, I very easily could have got to 1500 points. when I explained this to the staff member, he said don't worry, the next game is on me. Now if getting 150 points was easy, no problem. But in this case I got -475 tickets this way. Thanks for listening D & B. Also fecal matter was smeared about one of the toilets. By who? Its a mystery ;-)",

We had 3 different appetizers and they all were delicious I have to say the Ancho Caesar lettuce wraps with the chicken and bacon were our family's favorite we had 3 orders of them. All the meals were delicious and everyone enjoyed their food. The kids Loved the Blue Raspberry Sno Glowb & the Decadent Chocolate Fondue was a special treat. Very well staffed and family friendly :) We will definitely be returning . Thank you Dave & Buster's and Jack for making our birthday celebration the best!!",

It begins with a free lesson with a teacher, Brenda Smith, that is hilarious and makes it easy and fun to learn.  This lessons is from 7-8:30 every Wednesday and Sunday night on the roof of Dave and Busters.  You must be 21 to go as there is alcohol up there.  Then after that there is a DJ, and it's salsa all night until I think midnight.  It gets super packed up there as it is a popular event, which makes it real fun, but it gets super hot due to it being outside.  Sometimes they do mists and that helps a little bit.  Brenda also often have dance contests for a dave and busters giftcard and performances by her dance teams.    Dave and Busters:  They have alot of games and I enjoy coming here using a coupon if you sign up on their newsletters.  The coupons are usually buy $20 and get $20.  I like to go on Wednesdays because it's 1/2 off all games!  This place doesn't get over crowded where you have to wait long for games either.",

Not to mention that a roll of sweet tarts cost over 200 tickets in the store. I wouldn't waste my time or $ again. Tried to order an appetizer but waited forever and ended up leaving and going to get fast good.  Had issues with the card too. Had to have the tech's come over and fix games... Buyers beware!!!",

She followed it up with a wet rag. My stomach did flip flops, and I wanted to leave but we had already ordered and my husband had a plane to catch. Food was mediocre and equivalent to buying processed junk at Circle K.  My Thai salad was clearly salad straight from the bag with tiny nuggets of chicken about the size you'd give to a very small dog.  No peanuts and dressing was non-existent.  My husband's turkey sandwich was simply a few pieces of lunchmeat rolled up and slathered with mayo.  My kid's chicken fingers were small pieces of chicken encased in a lot of breading.  One of the worst dining experiences ever!  Amazing too because my husband said he had a really good burger here when he went with coworkers when they were considering D&B for an office party.",

    "text": "I want to be the mayor of my own little electric wonderland!   As mayor I promise to offer a fully stocked bar of spirits and fountains of cold beer to allow my constituency to quench their thirst while drunkenly lobbing skee balls down the lanes, spilling beers on the air hockey table, and riding bitch on virtual motorcycles. To remind them of their stay in my land of delight, I'll let them redeem tickets for cheap-o trinkets with the name of my wonderland plastered all over 'em. I'd be the kind of mayor that brings back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycophants on a lazy afternoon and I'd give teenage hooligans the boot, telling them to go frolick in Tilly's or Charlotte Russe because my electric wonderland is a den of iniquity and requires a chaperone over 25 for anyone under the age of 18.   Too keep the masses happy I'd offer a massive feast at reasonable prices, with appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, seafood, pasta, chicken, steaks and sweet, sweet desserts. And to make them feel like they're getting their money's worth, maybe I'll create little indulgences like happy hours and meal deals. Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.  And I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free! And I'll let 'em accumulate their ticket count over time to keep them coming back for more, more, MORE!  As mayor I will create a land where divorced dads with their kiddos, young couples looking for some goofy fun and video game nerds can coexist, with a happy beer buzz and over stimulated pupils the size of dinner plates due to my flashing lights, whirling colors and jaunty winning noises. It'll be like a casino, but it won't be a place where dreams go to die. Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games. There will be skee ball, air hockey, basketball free throw games, streaming water races, those games where the horse runs fast when you roll little balls into holes, virtual bowling, wacky drop the coin games, old skool Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders, House of the Dead, motorcycle and racecar games, virtual boxing and my personal favorite, Super Trivia, where six people match wits against one another and get hundreds of tickets if they're super suave like me! Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!  Ooo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top. And I'll even let 'em keep the shot glass, class act that I am. I can see it now, my own personal funland...  What? Dave and Buster's already snaked my idea? Those sneaky fucking bastards. I guess I'll just have to go there if I'm feeling the need for a little goofy fun.  Edit: By no means order anything that can't be produced by the divest of dive bars' short order cook. The food blows harder than a hooker trying to make rent on the 30th of the month. The games turn me into a giddy little girl, but the food turns me into a surly wench. Don't do it.",

    "text": "After receiving $35 in game cards for Dave and Buster's from my workplace for winning a contest, I invited my boyfriend to come with me last night for dinner and games. The dinner part was a mistake.  We first approached the hostess stand to try and get a table in the main dining area (not the bar). The hostess seemed really clueless when we asked her how long it would be. She just said \"ummmmm.....\" and turned around to stare at the dining room (for about 5 minutes). There were clearly a few dirty tables and some empty ones that were clean, but she told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So, we tried looking for a table in the bar area and found one immediately that another couple had just gotten up from. I hailed the bartender to ask if he could send someone over to clean the table. After waiting another 5-10 minutes or so, our waitress finally came over and cleaned the table for us.   The service was fine; nothing to write home about, but I do understand that a) It was a very busy saturday night, and b) we were sitting in the bar area and not drinking, so I wasn't expecting stellar service. We did get everything we needed within a pretty reasonable amount of time, considering the previous factors.   The food, on the other hand, was completely underwhelming. I felt like I wasted $40 on that dinner, to be honest. I ordered some kind of seafood and steak 'trifecta', and it was anything but that. It was kind of lukewarm, the steak was super tough and well done even though I asked for medium rare. Although they were small pieces on skewers and I do understand it's harder to cook those to a specified temperature, they were decidedly overcooked. I thought the shrimp were supposed to be in some kind of sauce and grilled, but they just looked like plain pink cocktail shrimp somebody had stuck on a skewer popped in the microwave for a few seconds. The best part of the meal was the rice pilaf it was all served over. My boyfriend got a chicken parmesan sandwich which he was pretty happy with, but I tasted it and thought it was kind of gross too. We skipped dessert and went on to play some games.  The games were great, no complaints there! At the end of the night we earned 1450 tickets which got me one pretty awesome stuffed elephant and a shot glass for both myself and my boyfriend.  Bottom line: Go for the games (and maybe booze); get the dinner somewhere else. There are way too many good options nearby to waste your money here on subpar food.",

My husband and I met up with a big group that was visiting from out of town and it was great for that.  They have some good deal where you buy a dinner for a certain amount (i want to say $15.99, but don't hold me on it) and you get a $10 game card.  Not bad, especially if you have a lot of people into playing the games.  We also ended up in the bowling section and had a blast.  Wait staff good and attentive.  Also, a big plus about them...you don't feel like you're being police patrolled...or that someone is going to walk up to you in 5 seconds shining a light in your face with a Breathalyzer just because your on your second drink in an hour and a half.",

    "text": "My previous experience with D&B is all East Coast, so I had some pre-conceived expectations prior to this visit. Those establishments were the size of small countries that I've visited in Europe! This one... not so much. I would actually rate this location a solid 2.5 stars, but since I wasn't overwhelmed, I rounded down.   I took a single-mom friend and her kids here for a night out. We went on a Thursday night, so it wasn't overly packed, but there was a nice crowd. Having experienced D&B food before (not that there is really anything wrong with it, just meh and way overpriced), we ate at the nummy Cheeseburger Cheeseburger down the way. Definitely a good choice.  Upon arrival we navigated the maze of tables to the \"card charging station\" and loaded up our plastic. The kids ran amok like junkies in a poppy field for about 45 minutes - tickets filling their little buckets. Mom and I trailed behind, people watching. This was by far the most interesting activity of the night. There was the scary man at the boxing game that had seen one too many steroids. His neck was two feet wide and the GUI boxer opponent had no choice but to pummel that huge target. My friend and I actually considered giving this one a try until we saw his display. His grunts and thrusts had us looking for cover for fear that he would turn on us and our laughter would definitely give away our location. There was the skeletal like goth-anorexic girl that had doubled her size by applying thick layers of black makeup. And there were the high school jocks that all walked with that inexplicable bounce that teen boys have. Like I said, for us it was all about the people watching.  The highlight of the evening happened at the jump rope simulation. We all discovered that jumping over an electronic eye posed far more of a challenge than anyone could imagine. Seriously this thing was way too funny (not so much for the jumper, but rather those watching the jumper contort and pounce).  Seventy-five minutes after entering, we were all out of money and selecting our \"prizes\" from the D&B store of crap. All in all we had a decent time. So why you may ask would I give this a 2 star rating? Well this little 75 minute trip into game land cost me $175 dollars and all I got to show for it was a bruise from when I was hiding from the roided dude on the boxing game. Yes there were 5 of us, but if I'm going to throw down this kind of money on games, I'm definitely going to Game Works!",

I also sampled the fried shrimp which was incredibly yummy but overpriced at $13.49.  Each cocktail was around $7 which was fair for the quality and alochol content.  Boyfriend had the chicken wings and loved 'em!  We also played $35 worth of games and spent a solid 3 hours gaming.  We also played with the photo booth in the back to find out what our future child would look like!  lol  The photo booth uses 20 gamer points and is WELL worth it!  This was a huge place great for big groups!  Not as many games as I'd like to see, but it's definitely a better deal than a night at Gameworks at Arizona Mills.",

But during the time it took to figure that out (3min or so), there was a manager-looking type man right there at the front desk who never even looked at us.  And there was another employee explaining something to another customer so she was busy.  Alright semi forgivable-  so we sat at the bar thinking that would expedite things.  The bartender brought food to the people 5 seats away but didn't acknowledge us.  We waited, and could hear bottles clanking, ice digging and gabbing ( bartenders i guess?) but on one came.  Nevermind! We left.  It was not as if they were busy - it was quite dead.  Customer service is a no brainer- can't respect this kind of lameness- no excuse!",

    "text": "Almost every time I've come to this location, the boneless wings are never cooked all the way through and are completely lukewarm. This has happened at least 3 times in a row now. Additionally, during my last visit, I ordered a vodka strawberry lemonade. I'm not sure what was so hard about that as a vodka lemonade is a common drink. I was once a server and I'm knowledgeable that all it doesn't take much to make that drink. The first time the server brought it to my table, it was in a different cup than another guest at my table who had gotten a vodka cran. I then tasted it and could clearly tell it was only strawberry lemonade, no vodka. I then go to the bar and tell the bartender that there's no alcohol in the drink when i has ordered it to be in there. He says he made the strawberry lemonade and put the shot of vodka on the side and the server must not of seen it. He then says he'll speak to the server. The server then comes back and says she poured it in there. I'm not dumb, there was absolutely no alcohol in there and she was just trying to save herself. My mother in law who has never consumed alcohol before tried the drink and said there was not a taste of vodka. She then brought me another when I ordered a second and said \"you should definitely be able to taste it this time, as it was in a large sized soda cup. I'm not sure what was so hard about putting it in the same cup the other alcohol beverage came in that was at my table. Once again, not a taste of alcohol. Mother in law tasted it again and once again couldn't taste a thing. Was then charged for both the \"vodka\" strawberry lemonades. Such an embarrassing look for the restaurant.",

Service- 4/5- I say this because it was a busy Saturday night and our waiter was slammed in the bar area, but still made sure we were somewhat taken care of. I came with one other, so our ticket wasn't going to be too high, so I can understand paying attention to bigger tables.  Games 4/5- the games were decent, most worked as supposed to. The only bummer was for the DDR game, two guys played it for a hour straight. They were sweating profusely all over the game, and set up a water station with them. They didn't rotate out for others to play, little annoying.  Food 2/5- Ok, as a chef I get it, it's a busy Saturday night, tables are packed. That's no excuse though for cold pizza bites, Luke warm chicken tenders. I understand most of the food is microwaved or thrown under a salamander to brown. But for it to come out cold like that is inexcusable. I was really upset to spend 30 bucks for cold food.   Overall- avoid high periods of activity. You'll get cold food, sweaty people taking over games.",

But I feel like we had a 2 star experience dining for dessert here, which is all we came to do really. We are not Dave & Buster regulars, on this particular evening we were searching for a big dessert to share, so we gave them a shot. We didn't know it was open seating, being newbies, and there were a few staff members who passed us and surely noticed us, but maybe they missed our confused expressions? We were waiting for a hostess, before realizing there were none. So we grabbed the first open dirty table we saw, there were no clean tables. We waited just under 10 minutes to get our drinks ordered, another 6 or 7 minutes to get out drinks delivered. We ordered our dessert, which unfortunately took an hour until it was brought to our table. Although delicious, there were too many signs telling me to avoid simple dining at Dave & Busters on a Saturday evening.",

I know running a restaurant can be expensive but THIS - is America. We comp incorrect orders here. I ordered a burger plain no cheese and it came with double cheese, then I'm told we're gonna get that taken off the bill for you and bring you the RIGHT order. So they do EXCEPT it's a rush order so it's medium rare and NOT \"well done\" like I ordered. Another burger comes out (NOT MY FAULT) and they drop it off to me, explaining the one prior to that is a \"rush order\", the next one was more done than the first. It's my understanding they're correcting their mistakes. Multiple. The mng in training and waitress come over to me and say I can \"have the extra burger if I want\". That to me means FREE. I wouldn't have taken it if they didn't say I could have the 2nd one. I know I have any food I want but the restaurant ONLY mentions it explicitly if it's meant to be complimentary. They TOLD ME it was THEIR mistake for bringing 2. The waitress told me I wasn't charged for the messed up burger or the 3rd (final) one but for the 2nd replacement one WHICH WAS THE ONE THEY WERE TAKING OFFFFF! for the mistake, duh! I'm NOT trying to get free food just trying to get them to keep their word. If they did it right the FIRST time I'd obviously pay for it. Smh.",

I was NEVER bored here. Outside on the District Stage was  SNOW falling. Well the appearance of snow falling. Inside was True fun. The food I will rate as a 3, servers a 5 and the entertainment a 5. The food gets a three because I gave the salad a True 5! The spinach and mixed greens were fresh and tasty. The mozzarella in salad was fresh as well. The candied pecans were delicious and fresh as well!! The salad could have been chopped smaller, but that is just my preference. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The potatoes were just ok. The rolls were very generic. Now onto the real winner of this party. All the games!!! There was skeet ball, video games, trivia games, shooting games, huge Pac-Man games, etc. This place was amazing. We each had $30 on a card and were alerted to all virtual games were unlimited play.  We played all night long. Won a new toy for the pooch and went home happy. Great company party!",

    "text": "I go here a lot, usually on Wednesday because they have the best happy hour with half off games and drinks.   The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because the food is hit or miss.  The buffalo chicken sliders are good, and so is the calamari.   Some of the other items were disappointing. I got a meal on the menu it was ribs, fries, and one other item, I think wings. From the picture you can see the ribs and the fries are in the same container, I don't care if my food touches each other my issue was they don't toss the ribs in sauce they pour it on them when they are with the fries so your fries are covered in BBQ sauce. Not a good combo to me, I usually give my son the fries but he wouldn't eat them with so much BBQ sauce.  Also the food can be inconsistent, the first time I got the nachos they were huge, last time I went they made the plate so small, that by myself I ate over half and I'm not a big eater, the first time I didn't even make a dent in them. (They are supposed to serve 2-4 people).   Also the first time I got the pizza bites they were awesome, another time the bread was hard.   There is one bartender who always waits on us, I wish I had his name, he gives the best service and is really attentive even when it is busy. I always sit on the side he is serving. The drinks are always awesome even when I say \"I don't know just make me something\".   My friend was in town for one night and I told her we should go here and we did and she was surprised at how low the bill was and said I'm glad you thought of this place.   On a side note I left my phone on one of the games one night and was almost in tears thinking I'd never get it back. (When you get iPhone through pre-paid services you pay full price so my outdated iPhone cost me around 350) I went to the front desk and someone had turned it in. It's good to know even the other people who go here are kind hearted.",

I ordered another appetizer separately which I also told her and when I asked her how much the TOTAL for the appetizer with the card she said the 28.99 along with the other appetizer and soda I ordered.

    "text": "This is pretty classic spend $40 for a stuffed toy, or in our case, some play sand. Dave and Buster's is a place that our family is familiar with and is a place that both the kids and adults enjoy. Located in the Tempe Marketplace, you won't get away without dropping some cash, but the entertainment value is where your money goes.  Arriving for a late dinner on a Sunday night, we could hear the salsa music from the patio upstairs which is unique to this location and haven't seen in any other D&B. It was Havana Night from 6:30-12 where ladies get in for free before 7:30 and there are free salsa lessons with $3 dos equis and $4 mojitos. We were seated immediately in a large booth in the dining area with clear views of UFC Fight Night on the many screens throughout the restaurant. We received great service and I would say the food was pretty mediocre. The food menu is large with American fare along with an equally large drink menu which includes a full margarita, tiki drink, tea, and snow cone beverage section. My wife likes sweet drinks and her strawberry watermelon margarita was perfect for her.  I ordered the steak salad and was pleased with the combination of bleu cheese, candied pecans, and herb vinaigrette to go along with the steak. The meal was part of an eat and play combo which got me the salad plus a card with $20 in play for $30 which was a good deal in my book. Keep your card to reload when you're done because you'll have to pay an activation fee for a new one and the card will also keep track of your ticket count. Also ordered were the: roasted turkey avocado BLT ($10.49), chicken parmesan alfredo ($12.99), and boss chicken club ($10.49). Everyone else finished their food and there were no complaints.  After we bought a $20 card for the kids, we spent about 90 minutes playing games. The nice thing is that if you get a little thirsty there are bars bordering both sides of the gaming area. There are plenty of driving and shooting games where you can compete against your family or others. The younger ones won't be left out either as there is a section of games for them.  If you bring a group, you're not leaving here without spending a chunk of change, but you'll have fun. Every night there are food and drink specials to go along with weekday early and late happy hours. Half priced games on Wednesday nights will take your dollar a little further so you won't have to spend as much for that little stuffed toy.",

Aside from the salmon being super salty, I had this uncomfortable, unsettled feeling all day. Went home, took down the Christmas lights to keep active thinking I might feel better. NOPE. I had developed a headache, took Exedrin,  and then finally tried Pepto. I have not thrown-up in a long time but last night's experience made up for it. That is still very fresh in my mind right now. Even though the server was nice, I can't get over my horrible day after eating there. And since that was the only food I ate yesterday, I am pretty confident in leaving this review. I felt instantly better after I threw up.",

Found our way to a small private area in between the game room and restaurant.  A small buffet area and a long table with 20 chairs and a large screen tv playing a variety of music videos occupied the space.  Waitress was attentive to our beverage needs. Food was served buffet style with our choices being mini sliders, chicken tenders and make your own nacho bar. Food was really good and a notch above standard bar / pub fare.  At the beginning of food service all of us were given a game card to play at our leisure. The place was wall to wall people but there were plenty of games and most didn't have a wait and if it did it was mere seconds.  Overall this was a great time! Beverages cold, food hot and tasty, service top notch. I never knew Dave and Buster's offered private rooms for parties. We will definitely keep this in mind for our next get together!",

They had $.50 tacos so we were able to stuff ourselves silly - I could even afford to buy dinner!   We were excited to see that D&B was having a Taco Tuesday, and then we got there, ordered 4 tacos @ $1.00 each, and they came out all on one plate. They offered no other plates, so we were essentially eating off a trough in the middle of the table. Waitress was like \"can I get you anything else?\" I thought, how about a couple little plates.  That's not all though. They literally had a mere pinch of cheese in each taco! WtF?!?!?! The meat didn't taste like it had any taco seasoning in it. The tacos were dripping grease, like it hadn't even been drained from the meat. I'm all for a greasy taco experience IF and only if there's enough stuff in the taco to make it worth all that grease. Otherwise? Gross!   This place gets one point for the games, one for having an upstairs bar (rather awesome), and one point for the chocolate fondue dish. This dessert (which we had on another night than Taco Tuesday) was truly yummy and we probably could've had it as our main course because it was so filling. Not entirely unhealthy, either as they had fruit along with the other stuff to dip in the chocolate.  For Taco Tuesday, we'll be going elsewhere.",

My girlfriend adores Dave and Buster's and will never turn down an evening here because of the atmosphere and games.  So there's a plus.  However, 30 or so dollars spent on \"power tickets\" will have you running back to the ticket venue for more fairly quickly.  Usually I end up with about 50 dollars worth on the first couple of times going.  (on just tickets, not including dinner)  Wednesdays (as far as I know) are always half price ticket days (meaning that the machines take half the amount of tickets).  So my honest suggestion, if you have a group of friends looking for a great time and a laugh, head down on a day that might save some cash.",

We were a group of about 20 with prior reservations and they had a separate room awaiting our arrival. There was one main waitress who was assisted by a couple of others when the food was served.  If I didn't look around at my dining companions, I wouldn't have felt like I was in a large group. The drinks were brought out quickly and promptly filled. When the food was brought out, the orders were correct, the temperature was excellent and it didn't take long to serve everyone.   I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion, good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price.  I would definitely order it again.  While we were eating the store manager came out and gave us a background on the company's history, the business model, how it has adjusted to the recession and described the length of time and number of staff it requires to open a new location. The newer models are smaller and require less time and resources to open - 45 days and a new store can be ready to go. This location is approximately 53,000 sq feet, while there are smaller ones around 15,000 sq feet.   After lunch, we broke up into teams and played 5 different games in a head to head format. Everyone had a good time and enjoyed not only the dining, but the gaming experience. I have been to the location in Atlanta and this was just as fun.  It was an excellent team builder and gave me the opportunity to check out this location. Bravo to the bosses for picking this place.",

They order the UFC fights & show them in the conference room. There's no fee to get in, but once seated, there's a minimum $20 per table which is the best deal I've ever heard for fight night.",

Most of the crowd is probably the ASU salsa class and friends, as its their instructor leading the lesson.  That said, it is a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere... I didn't see any of the die hard salseros, so perhaps they left this venue for the newer, fresher crowd.  Great place to take beginners to medium level.  DJ also played bachata!!!",

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the salsa night on the top floor. I visited in spring, so the weather was just right (I can imagine it may get too hot even at night during the summer).  There is no cover, and it comes with 2 hours of instruction which is awesome and rare.  There are all levels of dancers and all ages as well. I found most people to be friendly and willing to dance. They have a an informal dance contest which is fun and not intimidating. On the night that I came the place was packed. They play mostly salsa and bachata, with a sprinkling of merengue and cha cha cha. Towards the end of the night as it gets closer to closing time they start to play some hip hop and top 40.  If I am ever in the tempe area again I will definitely come back.",

The games are all run on these rechargable cards.  They have tons of video games, and of course skee ball and those silly basketball hoops.  Bring friends, get silly, and play some games.  You're not likely to meet a girl here unless she's working.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother the help unless you're just so fabulous that they cannot resist you.  In which case, you and I can be the two exceptions.  Or you could be daring and lure a girl here.  Come on, video games are almost cool now!  Ladies, if you're looking for an eligible geeky guy who's possibly socially challenged but likely trainable, this would be a prime spot.  When I was there it wasn't all that busy (Monday night) but the staff seemed friendly and eager to please.  There was a slight incident with an overly friendly guy who wanted to be our personal trainer on this game that resembles DDR but is too hard for words because of all the hopping skipping and jumping in different directions.  Anyways, I'm pretty certain by the lack of uniform that he was not working there, just trying to be friendly.  A little too friendly.  But back to the game itself.  Man it was hard!  But hey, if you don't mind looking retarded in public,  which I don't, -especially when playing video games - it's great cardio.  Play Time Crisis 4 at least once.  Tell them I made you.  Edit:  I hear what Max is saying.  There were no kids there when I was there.  I suggest you go later and drink more.",

Where most D&Bs have well planned, permanent eating areas (booths), this one has an empty area with a bunch of tables and chairs thrown in there. There is more comfort and ambiance at Chuck E Cheese!  The food and service here is also worse than any other D&Bs I've ever been to. I think they abducted their wait staff from McDonalds.   The games are standard, nothing special there. Overpriced as always.   I suppose if you're some drunk college kid who doesn't know any better, this place is heaven, but for the rest of us it's a waste of time and money.  P.S. I have to laugh at the dumbass who complained about the fact that there are children at an arcade! Oh the nerve!!! How dare parents bring children to an arcade!?!? Get a life snigglenuts!",

The viscious cycle has been removed.  I can set my beer right next to the arcade.  Gameworks is fun, sure, but I think that little kids are gross.  They have boogers on their fingers.  There aren't any booger-fingery little bastards running around at D & B.    This place can be a little pricey, but it's not overly pricey.  These aren't dive bar prices.  The way I see it, I'm paying a little extra so as to remove myself from the threat of having a baby scream right next to me, right when I'm about to shoot a zombie.  Also, one time, I won enough tickets to get a Star Wars film cell.  Dorky?  You're damn right, it is.  Is that shit hanging up on a shelf at home, right now, as we speak?  You're damn right, it is.",

So we reloaded our cards played a few games, putting the annual spanking on my gf in nascar. our friends arrived and we sat down for dinner, and so did a large (20 or so) group well it was happy hour and you can't pass up 1/2 off drinks right?! we put in our order and it was just taking awhile, as it turned out our order was in after the large group, and we had to wait. well not long after the train of wait staff brought out their million dishes we recieved ours, both our waiter (Jason i believe) and the manager (i'm assuming) came and told us that dessert was on them, SWEET! (no pun intended). our food was good also only problem being that one of our chicken wings had a lot of fat on it. I had trhe southwest grilled chicken salad, I'd say that i should have handed over my man card but when a salad is that good (and considering the crap fried food i had for lunch) i held on to it.   now If we could just get rid of all the kids after 9pm...",

I got a chicken sandwich, pretty safe usually and it wasn't half bad.. it just wasn't half good either. They serve that crappy syrupy iced tea which I hate, and on top of that they disappear when you are out of your drink which is even more insulting when the place is empty.   I suppose this place does what it is supposed to at a basic level- they feed you and you don't die, but I will make it a point to head somewhere else.

It was 10pm on a Saturday night and Gary and I had both been working non stop since 11am, we were hungry and wanted to do something fun... I said video games??? and got his attention right away.   We took a stroll through the arcade to peruse our selection.  We found Ms. Pac-man, the only game Gary wanted to play.  So we had dinner first.   We split a Spinach Dip, 4 mini hamburgers and the fondue.  It was all just.... okay.  There were WAY more chips than dip, and the chips by themselves sucked.  The mini hamburgers were pretty good but only because they were on hawaiian rolls.  The fondue would have been better if we had more melted chocolate.  We ended up with left over marshmallows, brownie bites, graham crackers and bananas....    Oh, his martini was pretty good.  I had a couple of sips and really liked the glowing green sugar rim.  For what we ordered, it was pretty expensive and the portions were not divided accordingly.   THEN we went to play some games.  It took Gary three tries but he blew the high score that was on Ms. Pac-man out of the water!  So he was happy.  That was his goal.  We also shot some hoops, I even made 6 whole points! Yay!  We played a helicopter game and that sucked because I didn't get it... and we finished up on the motorcycles and raced each other about 5 times.  I do like video games but he always beats me...  We checked out the shop where you trade in your tickets but since we don't need anything we gave our tickets to three little kids to share.  If I was looking for something to do late one night, they close at 1am, I might go back to play video games... but I would never eat here again.",

I'm not usually a fan of D&B food, but today I tried the Parmesan Chicken Alfredo ($11) and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  The portion was large, so felt like I got my money's worth.  The others ordered the Goldfingers Eat & Play Combo ($15.99 / chicken tenders & fries) and the Buffalo Bar Chicks (pretty much buffalo chicken tenders on dinner rolls).    This D&B's gaming area is smaller than the one I go to in Arcadia (CA) and there are fewer games too.  My sister assures me this D&B is pretty happening during weekends/evening hours, but right now I have a hard time believing this.  I'll go with friends next time and have a few drinks at the bar during evening hours.    It feels nice to not have to \"fight\" other patrons for the games.  I like to \"cheat\" and get loads of tickets by spinning that huge ticket wheel...always a line for that one.  I hit the jackpot and got 1,000 tickets...yay!!!    The prizes aren't worth much, but hey, we go here to have fun and pretend to be kids for a few hours.    I love that this D&B is located at the Tempe Marketplace.

    "text": "The arcade is pretty awesome (SKI BALL!!! YES PLEASE!!!) and in the few times I have been here, the games seem to be well maintained.  Sometimes, I just want to pretend to be a kid again yet still be able to be an adult and drink a beer while being one (uh, wait.  What?  Eh, you get what I mean).   If you want to waste a couple of hours and have some mindless fun, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "Well, don't let my gender fool ya. I love to play video games and romp around like a kid on Ritalin. Yep, it's True. So imagine my sheer delight when my creative work cohorts and myself planned an outing to the newly opened D&B's in Tempe Marketplace. I was so excited, I arrived like 10 minutes early to scope out the place.   Sure, I had been to Jillian's at Desert Ridge. I had fun, but wasn't impressed with their games. That's why I thought D&B's would be, like, so much better. (cue the rolling of the eyes...now!)   Why can't I have my adult playland? Why do I have to be surrounded by crappy arcade games and whirling, twirling stupid sound machines? No, I don't want to actually be 10 again and be amazed by cheap arcade games. I want to be amazed I can go someplace and pretend I'm 10 again. Make sense?  So, my friend and I started at the air hockey table. Uhm, since when did the air hockey puck not float and get stuck in the sides of the board? Talk about a killjoy. After that, we headed over to the fenced in basketball goals. You know, those crazy ones that moves back and forth and shout obnoxious things at you? Yeah, those. Eh, after a couple games, I'm bored. I don't want a moving target. I want a real shoot out competition. That's why I was glad to see real basketball goals, two of 'em, so I could have the shoot out I wanted to badly. That's where you'd find me, if I were to ever go back to D&B's. Forget the air hockey and motorcycle video games. Nevermind the boxing game that's surely rigged (I was totally ducking, a$$hole!). I'm camping out at the basketball game. To me, it's the only one that feels like a grown-up game.   Yeah, the trivia game is fun, but one round is, like, 5 questions. It takes me longer to tie my shoes. Sheesh. Rip off. Let down. Talk about a premature... Ok, so maybe I'm going overboard.   Back to the games. With air hockey, trivia, boxing and both b-ball games played, what was left? I went on a hunt to find the martial arts game, cuz, let's face it, I love that game. I love pretending to kick the livin' $hit out of somebody. Well, I couldn't find it. Talk about the rest of the air deflating from my wanna-be balloon.   So, the real question is this: Did I have fun? Yes, I did. I admit it, but I spent a great portion of my time wandering around, hoping and wishing for more adult games, like virtual reality and the kind you'd find in a \"Must Be This Cool to Play\" arcade. I wanted to throw real punches and kicks. I guess I was hoping for a total fun experience (simulated skydiving anyone?) and expecting more of a wii experience than one that offers me silly games that you can find in any ol' place, like GameWorks. Or worse, the state fair.",

    "text": "We went here Sunday to watch the football games, eat, play some games, and get our drink on. We sat up at the bar. Ryan, our bartender, was lovely. He was totally adorable and took care of us. We ordered the food and game deal, which I think is really cool. I got the Philly and a $10 game card for like $15. They also have happy hour during games. Blue Moons were like $4. After drinking heavily, we hit the game room and had a blast. The best game to win lots of tickets is the Nascar game. After playing so many games our heads hurt and giggling like fools, we stumbled into the store to exchange our tickets for awesome prices. I ended up with a Patrick stuffed animal and a pixy stix and I was extremely happy. No one bugged us and let us enjoy ourselves. I look forward to going back on Wednesday nights for half-priced games.",
