The negatives: The food. -The steak was very average. it didn't have much of a char sear on it. It was not very tender, and the flavor was very, what I like to call, supermarket. It didn't taste like it was seasoned at ALL. Maybe I am spoiled.  I lived in Dayton, OH for 19 years, and am used to eating steak at a top 3 steak house in the US, The Pine Club.   The presentation didn't help.  I wish I had taken some pictures. The steak was on a HUGE white plate, with some green beans thrown on it.  Very boring, plain, and unappetizing. I will not be going back. I hope to find a good, solid, non-chain steakhouse soon.",

From the moment we started up the hill to the restaurant they were excited. They loved seeing the bull outside and the cave like entry.  My niece looked like her eyes were going to pop out when the giant bowl of Mac & Cheese was put down in front of her.  The highlight of the night was our visit to the dance floor to listen to the band and do a little dancing. The guys in the band do a great job interacting with the kids and really made their night by giving my niece their autograph.  The reason for 4 stars this visit is because I think the food has gone down a little since our last visit although the beef ribs were  still good. Regardless, we will definitely be back for the view and the band.",

We ordered the cowboy meal for 2 and feasted on barb q chicken, ribs, beef skewers chicken skewers, corn on the cob, fried shrimp, pineapple cole slaw, salad, biscuits and cowboy beans. While the view is probably great during the day, at night all you see are city lights. There were several families and kids were literally running around the restaurant and to the indoor slide. Not the place for a quiet, cozy romantic dinner. But definitely good food with a relaxed atmosphere.",

He also recommended I get the rattlesnake app, but I didn't have the stomach to try it.  I didn't end up getting an appetizer, but the bread was nice.  The basket includes biscuits and fry bread.  The fry bread was definitely the highlight and was quite good with the cinnamon butter.  The biscuits were solid and better with the honey that was at the table.  Soon my entree arrived.  I ordered the sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak also came with carrots and corn on the cob.  I didn't try the carrots, but they looked fine.  The corn was good.  The steak was okay.  The cook on it was fine, but it could have used more seasoning.  Just a little bland.  What I struggled a bit with was the mashed potatoes.  I like mashed potatoes.  Just potatoes in general.  Maybe it was in the gravy, or maybe they put it in their potatoes, but there were onions in mashed potatoes.  That threw the flavor all off.  Couldn't really taste the gravy or the potatoes.  Just onion.  I didn't care for it and didn't finish.  The server, Brooklyn, was super nice and attentive.  Nothing bad to say about her.  The view was spectacular!  I was sat next to a window and got to look out and enjoy all during my meal.  Not a bad place at all.  Just to my taste, I wish it was better.",

It took nearly 2 hours to actually get our food and when we did, both steaks were horribly over cooked. Our food resembled camp slop. The \"salad\" was disgusting limp iceberg lettuce drenched in ranch with some croutons and a couple of slices of cucumber. My steak came with an enormous pile of carrots. I don't know a rabbit who could eat that large of a pile of bland carrots.  Our waitress was kind, but rarely present when needed and never offered drink refills. I wasn't inclined to wait another hour for a new steak so I did eat my over cooked steak, as did my husband. I'm a local and was on a staycation, so I really hope this isn't what our tourist think we have to offer. Phoenix has some amazing restaurants, this one is not. It's all a gimmick, tourist trap, eat a rattle snake, etc etc. So many better places to go.",

This year we decided to eat Christmas dinner at Rustler's Rooste and we were so disappointed. The Turkey dinner literally tasted like it was left over from Thanksgiving...it was that bad! Everything from the potatoes to turkey was VERY dry. The turkey was in tiny little pieces and they tried to cover up the dryness by drowning the entire meal with gravy! The worse part was when I told the manager my concern, he was very condescending and tapped me in the shoulder and said \"thanks for letting me know, but I just did a quality control check and the food wasn't dry.\" Neither my daughter in law or myself even ate the meal because it was so disgusting. We weren't the only ones complaining. I heard several tables around us complain to the servers. What a disappointing holiday dinner, and even more disappointing was the customer service. Don't waste your money...go somewhere else! A frozen dinner is higher quality.",

The magician 5 star! The band 5 star! The balloon guy 5 star! The Food 5 star!  The waitress Jennifer handled my Dad's 65th birthday party of 18 (with a few extras here and there) like a champion!!

Order the Rattlesnake (because hey-your at Rustler's Rooste-they have Rattle Snake dang), and of course have STEAK! Uh-mazing! And if you are wondering... yes they have awesome ranch and yes they have sweet tea, full bar, shuffle board, pin ball, dance floor, an indoor bridge, indoor slide, a Christmas Tree, a running fountain and walk through cave to enter the reataurant and.... a live bull.

AN HOUR!? holy moly....i wouldn't wait an hour for bianco pizza, much less a kitschy tourist restaurant....but....i could hear my father in my ear saying \"wow, this place looks neat!\" and thus...we waited...an hour....at the bar....for our table.  the bar was basically empty at 5:30 so we had a couple of beers (around 4bucks each...way too expensive) and bided our time. at 6pm, the line out the door was enormous, along with the clientele. after an hour, we were taken downstairs and seated right in front of the band, which was fun. the sawdust covered floor added to the appeal of the place and to my father. i ordered the swordfish which was cooked perfectly. my father, the T-bone, and he said it was cooked wonderfully. our dog thoroughly enjoyed the bone afterwards.   our server was prompt, friendly, and was always available without being overbearing. even with a huge wait list to get in, we never felt rushed to finish our meal. prices are a tad high, my fish was 20 bucks. but you get a basic iceberg salad, a basket of really warm and tasty rolls and biscuits, and a pot of baked beans (with pork), so it's a decent deal for visiting relatives.   but some things to consider....walking up the hill from the lower parking lot proved very difficult for my aging father, but they do offer a shuttle from the lot to the door. even to get to the concierge can be challenging (it also is a slight uphill walk inside the restaurant) for elderly or handicapped persons. the concierge girl is NOT friendly at all, but that's almost to be expected with the throngs of people that come here. prices are a bit high, especially for drinks. the sheer mass of people eating here can be a bit overwhelming, and there are screaming kids EVERYWHERE! parents don't bother to tend to their ill-behaved kids, and it can be a nightmare if you don't have the ability to drown out their ever present running around and screaming.   but....the place is neat. exposed rock wall, a slide, and the view of phoenix from the hillside is amazing!",

Rustler's Rooste was complete with an indoor slide, indoor wall-fountain, performers, amazing city views, a photo-booth, silly cutouts that you can put your face through, and an overall western vibe. Coming into this place, I had great expectations for the food. Sadly, the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the steak, which came with beans and corn. It was alright, but tasted like any other meal. The steak was a bit too chewy, the corn was... well, corn, and the beans were just 'okay'. Something was amiss. Also, it was difficult to have a conversation because it was quite loud. I'm not sure if this was because of the location of the table.  The restaurant didn't have a sit-and-dine kind of atmosphere, but rather a louder, rowdy wild wild west kind of atmosphere (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending).   Bottom line: -I would recommend checking out this restaurant if you want a new experience and a fun atmosphere, especially if you're new to Phoenix or Arizona. Also, this place would be good for parents with kids to visit. -I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're searching for restaurants with exquisite or scrumptious foods.",

Kids loved the slide, the balloon guy and the sawdust on the floor. Neat place to take your family.",

    "text": "I was very excited because I had won a gift basket at La Noche de Yelp Elite Event in March for Rustler's Rooste and thought well my mom is coming from Washington for a visit in April why not take her there, it would be a 1st time for the both of us! Sounds like a great plan right!  Mom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her.   We got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.  Well 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.     We were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs! Going to have to come back from some more of them!  I have to say Jennifer and the nice man at valet parking showed get customer service, but the hostess left me with a bad impression and she is where the dining experience starts.",

The only knock against them is that I had to salt and pepper the steak because it was lacking, but the beef was real good.",

Unfortunately what I got was a really, really well themed restaurant that seemed to feature quantity over quality and gimmiky stuff (candy floss on check) which, while nice, doesn't really enhance the meal.   To be completely honest, the food itself would have been a 2 (yes, the steak really wasn't that flavorful) however the staff and live band made up for it.   I wanted to love this place, but couldn't :(",

The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...",

We made reservations for 5 pm, arrived at 4:45 and did not get seated until 6:20 pm. Many families were in same boat! It was a chaotic scene yesterday! Service was horrible, mashed potatoes were WAY too salty and pumpkin pie was super soggy / sugary! The only thing they got right was the turkey and yummy salad. For next thanksgiving, please honor your reservations! People don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes... But really an hour and a half??? You got the view going for you but that is about it! A total disappointment Rustlers Rooste... Why?",

They do have a few things to keep you occupied while waiting like the poor bull locked up outside and the slide in the restaurant. The panoramic windows inside do give an amazing view of the skyline although we waited so long we missed the view of the sunset. When we finally were seated it took forever to order food and then took even longer to get the food we ordered. 3 of us in our party ordered the Nacho appetizer as our entree. When it came the chips were stale and the cheese looked like the dish had been sitting there for a good 15 min before it was brought to our table. Food was blah, prices were expensive, nice views and still had a good time with family. Probably will not be back.",

After waiting 70 minutes I checked with the hostess and was informed the wait would be seated shortly. After another 30 minutes I checked in  to no avail. My party had become restless and Hungry. We did contact a manager who said he would get us a table next, but after 2 hrs waiting without being informed of  any extensions in wait time or reasons given, we left and will not be returning. I am soo disappointed that what was supposed to be a fun excursion with family and friends went so badly and ended up going home without dinner. Driving in from the West valley and friends from Mesa  left empty bellied and disheartned. Please review your protocol for seat times so others are not given a False hope",

    "text": "Let's be clear: this place is a gimmick.  It's a corny, western-themed place to take out-of-towners who haven't been to the Southwest.  They do the gimmick thing well, and it is what it is.  If you want an absolutely delicious meal in a pleasant environment, go elsewhere, but if you want somewhere silly to take a family member as a funny 'intro' to Arizona, this will work.  I'm definitely NOT knocking the gimmick thing.  It has it's place and is great for a laugh.  That's where the two stars come from, because they know what they are and you get exactly what you'd expect: mediocre food at a high price while surrounded by heavily-themed EVERYTHING.  As a foodie, though, I do have to knock the prices and food quality separately from the 'gimmick' side of this place.  It's not bad food, but it definitely isn't great either.  Very mediocre.  On the plus side, my steak was cooked perfectly (med. rare) which I always appreciate, but that's about the only thing that stood out as positive.  The salad was way too heavy on the dressing and the biscuits in the bread basket tasted like canned biscuits.  The real downside to this is the pricing...very expensive! It helps to think of it as you're paying for the gimmick experience and the great view, not just the food.  I've heard their cocktails and margaritas are good, so that's a plus.  Overall, come here once when you want to bring out-of-towners, but don't plan on it becoming a regular favorite.  They do what they do relatively well, but it's not really worth multiple return trips.  Come at sunset!",

It has a nice western atmosphere and the cow out front is a nice touch. Everything else was miserable. My husband got the steak and enchiladas. He was fairly happy with it. My grandma got some wings and she was happy too. I got the prime rib which tasted awful (and was exceptional chewy) and they paired it with corn and carrots for 23.95 - are you freaking kidding me? Their \"fries\" are way too big and my kids refused to eat them. Their kids mac and cheese is practically easy mac. We splurged and got some rattlesnake as well. We got 5 itty bitty pieces for almost $20. The wait staff was rude to us and the place was uncomfortably packed full of people. I'm sure other people had better experiences but I though this place was quite awful.  I might have been able to write a better review had I not paid over $100 to not enjoy my dinner at all.",

I ordered the 10oz Rustlers Cut Steak was amazing. It was very juicy and properly seasoned. The beans they served them with were great as well. One thing that they served that was amazing were the sweet potato fries. These bad boys were sweet and tangy, tasted just like curly fries. The atmosphere is kind of like a dance hall set up. The have a slide you can ride on to get to the second level. Yes a slide. Definitely a great family place to hit up if you are in town.",

The waiter will charge you if you want a substitute food!!!   The burger meat was dry and underwhelming for that price!   Others at the table ordered fried chicken, white meat, for $16.95.  The chicken breast was massive,  dry and rubbery.  Included were mushy vegetables, that were unrecognizable.   The place seems worn out and dirty.  A western band took up the rest of the sound in an already chaotic place.

Over the next 15 minutes the servers and management did nothing and avoided the scene. My wife and I stood by and didn't know what to do. The parents didn't want us to call an ambulance but pretty sure management should have as soon as she passed out; I would think this to be protocol.   During this incident, I lost my seat to the girl's father who was taking care of her. The mother was panicking and crying. Her friends didn't know what to do. Why didn't management come out and assist? So strange.   To top it off, our server let us stand to the corner without a table and didn't once offer to seat us somewhere else. In fact, the server only came by one time throughout this ordeal even with a girl and her father on the floor...  I finally flagged down a different server and asked for a seat since ours was occupied. To top it off, the quality of the food was low and overpriced and they made a bad drink for my wife. I will never go back to this restaurant.",

If you have never been, it's a must, at least once.  We made reservations for 5 pm because it was a Friday.  It probably wasn't necessary that early in the day.  There was already a line started for service when we got there.  You can opt to slide in or walk down the steps.  We slid.  We requested a view.  We got a table next a window with a beautiful view but the table was tight and because you are seated at the side it is a limited view.  There was a horseshoe table right across from us which would have allowed everyone to have an almost 180 view.  They start with biscuits and donut type biscuits with regular whipped butter and cinnamon whipped butter.  They didn't taste freshly made, but they were good.  We ordered the rattle snake appetizer with cactus fries.  The first batch came out cold.  Mind you, we are here when they opened.  They brought out a fresh appetizer.  The salad comes to the table in one big bowl to be dished out.  The 13 y/o ordered the filet and loved it.  The 23 y/o ordered the all you can eat ribs.   He ate what he had, none of the sides, and didn't get any more.  Which is very unlike him.  He said they were ok.  My husband tried it and said they didn't taste fresh.  Like maybe they had been left from the night before and it didn't sell. The waiter brought a small dish with rolled damp clothes which I thought was nice.  They weren't warm.  I thought that would have been nicer. We shared the bone in ribeye, which was cooked to perfection.  Baked beans come as a side for the table and no one even tasted them.  Corn on the cob came as a side which tasted over cooked and dry.  They don't offer a military discount but in lieu offer a slice of chocolate cake.  This slice is HUGE.  I didn't count, but maybe a 15 layer cake.  I didn't try it either, so I don't know how it tasted.  They also bring out some cotton candy, bubble gum flavor, as you leave.  Lots of cute ideas here, but overall we were disappointed.",

    "text": "Nestled above the Arizona Grand Resort is this fun restaurant. The restaurant is huge and can accommodate many large groups which worked well for us. As you enter it can be overwhelming because again, it's huge, and there are a lot of ppl which means a little noisy too on top of the live music being played.  I ordered a margarita at the bar which was fast. He said it was the least sweet of the margs yet it was still a little sweeter than I had hoped for but still good. When you order food, you get a choice of ribs, chicken, beef or shrimp. I had the beef and it was very juicy, tender and tasty. Hubby had the ribs which had meat that fell right off the bone and was really delicious. Dinner comes with bbq beans, corn and a basket of bread.  After dinner you can delight in some cotton candy (you can see it being made fresh as you walk into the entrance of the restaurant), live music and dancing on the first floor. If you're feeling up to it, you can even take a ride down the slide that takes you from the 2nd floor right down next to the dance floor!  Great fun place to go to have dinner and some fun with the family. If you're staying at the hotel, there's a shuttle that will give you a ride; it's not far but that AZ heat is no joke!",

She was so attentive to refills, checking back on our meals, and she did it with ease and a smile. We were so appreciative for the service and overall beautiful Arizona experience. Thank you Crystal and the whole Rustler's Rooste Family.",

    "text": "I grew up in Arizona I frequented Rustler's Roost over a few decades.  I have since moved to Portland, Oregon and wanted to share the experience with my kids.  After reading all of the negative reviews we almost didn't go.  I was worried it would cost a fortune and leave me feeling unsatisfied.  So glad I rolled the dice.  My husband and I arrived with a small army of kids: 2 little guys and 6 teens. Yes we travel with 8 kids. Lol.    We all loved it.  Drinks (with refills) bread and family style table salad came out quick.  While we waited we got up danced to the live music and went back down the slide.  Portions were ample.  Even with 4 teen boys we couldn't finish it all.  We hit the jackpot with our server, Bobby.  He has was warm and friendly.  He managed the table like a pro.  He took our order with no notes and nailed it!!! For all 10 of us.  I ordered the combo platter with ribs. Super good.  But the real home run is their bacon and jalapeno mac n cheese.  It's a side and only $5.95.  I could have made a meal out of it.  A couple of my boys ordered the hot wings.  An appetizer for $9.95, they couldn't eat all 12 of them.    Don't listen to the nay sayers. This is still a place to go.  Ask for Bobby Brown's section.     We ordered drinks for all kids,  3 margaritas and 10 meals. Our total was less then $250 with a 20%+ tip.  Where can you have fun and eat dinner at a unquie place for that?",

The server Nichole was so friendly and attentive. We both ordered the \"Wrangler\" (a bone-in Ribeye) and I asked for it to be cooked medium rare but with a nice charred crust - not an easy thing to execute but they nailed it. My dad's steak was also cooked just the way he wanted it. The sides were equally tasty. At the end of the meal a bunch of servers came out and sang happy birthday to my dad, and gave us the biggest piece of chocolate cake I've ever seen (with candles that would not blow out!). It was rich and delicious. The manager said the cake is one of only 3 things on the menu that they don't make from scratch at the restaurant (they have a bakery they use). Apparently, they also have their own Butcher on the property. As far as the building goes, it has a lot of history and was used as a mineshaft long ago. It's on the grounds of the beautiful Arizona Grand Resort. It also looks to be a good time for kids with a slide down into the dining room and there's live bands that play on the weekends. I recommend this place and will definitely be going back soon to try their menu item \"Cowboy Stuff\" - which is a variety of chicken, seafood, & beef. From the looks of the menu everything seems to be priced at a good value.",

The cactus was a surprise as it was tart and juicy. Almost addicting. Almost. Also chowed down on the BBQ ribs. Overly abundant and apparently all you can eat. I could only it 4 but our spunky yet charming waitress said she thought i could tackle 2 more.  Added value was the wandering magician comedian and general welcome guy (much like the Wal-Mart greeter). And for kids the ever popular balloon animal folks. But what made the meal complete was beyond the western ambiance, it was a spectacular view of the mesa during sunset.",

She took our order right away and kept coming by table to make sure we were good or if we needed anything. She brought the boys' food out quickly and then our food arrived shortly after. We were very pleased with the service that she provided to our family. She understood how it is dining with kids. I hope next time we come we end up with the friendly and very customer oriented Jen L she was 5 stars.",

All the usual corn beans and bread etc. Staff was great, the facility is lots of fun and everyone had a great time. Hoping they do it again next year.",

My sister, brother-in-law, my fiance and myself all had the fillet mignon; we all agree it had no flavor. My sister likes her steak cooked well; hers came burnt on one side and red on the other! My fiance's food was supposed to be medium and was pink on one side and well on the other. Mine was supposed to be pink throughout and was not pink at all. My niece and her kids did enjoy their food.  One had cajun steak and the kids had the kids steak and mac n cheese which was ok!    Each meal comes with a piece of corn on the cob, veg of the day, a bowl of baked beans to share and family style salad to share as well as dinner rolls. Unfortunately we were not impressed.",

I yelled at them to stop and THEN the attendant came over. I asked him what was wrong with him? Why didn't he stop them? And he replied \"there's nothing wrong with ME - there's something wrong with YOU - you're yelling at kids.\"  Huh, ok. My father-in-law is an officer with the Tempe police department so I went and asked his opinion - turns out pelting defenseless caged animals with rocks is considered felony abuse, but yelling at kids to stop hurting it? Nope, that's just human decency.    Yes, the view is great, but this place with its shady staff, long waits and mediocre food does NOT deserve your hard earned money.",

The menu is difficult to read and could be much better designed. The steak I had was so-so. The kids' food was also so-so. But there was a lot of it. And the kids ate free. How can you complain about that?   I couldn't enjoy the view much because the light of the window backlit the others in my party. I couldn't see my own kids or my husband.

I parted ways with my daughter at this point.  I didn't need The DVD player to entertain her this meal, the slide entertained her till the food arrived.  She came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision, and then went back to sliding.  With some older kids present, letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious, but sipping my water in silence left me unconcerned.  I ordered a kids meal, grilled cheese, for her and I had meat.  My daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.  For my part, meat is good.

The atmosphere was not bad. The decor was overall cheesy but not terrible.  Live music was a nice touch and the outdoor area was the best part of the place on a nice night with a great view. Food was okay, our steaks were cooked well, nothing blew us away culinarily but we weren't completely disappointed. My largest complaint would be the service. I would say my three stars are for food and atmosphere. Service was awful and warrants zero stars. Our waitress, Brianna, greeted us with a \"hey\" and before we even indicated that we were interested in more than drinking she set down a bowl of salad and a huge basket of bread (which was way too much bread for two people) then walked away. We later overheard another server explaining the homemade dressing, biscuits, fried bread and the different butter to her table. Our server did not give us that information, probably because she was way more interested in her bartender coworker. She stayed at the bar chatting with him while another employee set our food on a tray in front of our table. That employee abruptly walked away while we just starred at our covered food for 7 minutes until Brianna came back. When she did come back she didn't even acknowledge that we had been waiting for our food while she was socializing. Maybe we did just get the one bad server or one bad night but it definitely affected our entire experience.",

Out of 4 steaks ordered only one was cooked correctly and all four were luke warm. The veggies on the plate were cold (the butter would not even melt on the corn).  Everything seemed like it sat in the kitchen for a long time before being served.  My steak was really tough and I watched everyone pouring salt on the food trying to find some flavor.

We had to park in the bottom of the hill parking lot but they have a shuttle that we didn't take. Take the shuttle if you aren't wearing sneakers.  We showed up (6 of us) around 7 and were told it would be an hour wait.  After 15 minutes they had a booth for us. We walked past the live cow and got to take the slide downstairs. The hostess waited for us at the bottom of the slide. It was a booth that fit all 6 of us easily and we are not little petite people. The only drinks on the specialty menu had tequila but the das boote was recommended as a particularly girly drink. It is supposed to taste like melon but it tasted like Jello and came out on fire and you get to keep the boot glass! We ordered rattlesnake as an appetizer and it tasted like fried whitefish. It came with the snake's spine? 4 of us ordered the Cowboy Stuff where you get everything for $22. Then the balloon man Frank came to the table. Even though we were all adults he made us balloon animals. He was fantastic! I got a giraffe with a different colored mane. My friends and BF got a T-rex, a monkey with banana and a motorcycle. I went outside to get a close up of the views and by the time I got back  our table was filled up with cowboy stuff. The sauce on the meat was delicious and the seafood was well cooked as in tasty. The potatoes made me feel as if I had died and gone to carb heaven. The beans were bland and the pineapple coleslaw disturbing but if that's the worst I can say about a place is that two of their sides weren't my favorite then I think it's all right. My friends that didn't order cowboy stuff got ribs. Deliciously tangy sauce with a little bit of heat. I was originally terrified by the idea of their live band as usually those are so loud you can't hold a conversation but they had their own section and rocked out. There were a lot of kids around but none I would consider obnoxious. They seemed to burn off their over-stimulation riding down the slide and going up the stairs again. Our server was incredibly fast and somehow managed to see our drink glasses  through all of the stuff on the table and keep them filled. Basically it was fun enough we plan to come back within a month to celebrate a friend's birthday with a giant hat and an eclair the size of her head. Well worth it and the views from our table were incredible.",

I loved the Real Live 900 ton Texas Long Horn at the front door, Was a little fragrant though. The best thing i did in this place was, take the Slide to the bottom half of the restaurant., And i was in a dress too..lol. ok very cowboyeee looking, saw dust the whole thang. i had been wanting to come here for a min. My Honey took me for a romantic dinner. My steak was WELLLLLL done shoe leather. The entire meal was luke warm. Like the forgot to bring it. It wasn't cheap, I wont go again.

The food was pretty good I give the food about a 3 and a half but I was more intrigued by the atmosphere. I mean they had rattlesnake on the menu for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! They also have a balloon guy who walks around and makes balloon figures and stuff; well get this, he made me a shotgun and it gets even better, he made my friend a mini toilet. Another cool thing is that it is like inside a mountain and they have a live band. The kids will love it! They also have a slide down to the restaurant area for the kids! All around fun! They also have a bull in front of the restaurant!",

Three orders of prime rib were all done medium rare perfectly and the au jus and horseradish were excellent. The order of salmon and the bountiful fresh family style salad was crisp and fresh. Beer & wine refills were a testament to the outstanding quality of service. My spouse and sister-in-law also enjoyed the pumpkin pie. The country band \"Peso Dollar\" added a sw feel to the faux western decor. The patrons at other tables appeared equally pleased. The scenic carpet of lights view of Phoenix added to the total experience. With management and attentiveness to detail like this, we will be back.",

Horrible Service, Extremely Long Wait to take food order, deliver food, and bring out our checks (Total of 1hr just in waiting throughout the night), food came out cold, and the waiter forgot the Kids meal, brought it out last! Poor thing had to snack on my fries while she waited for her food. The checks even came out wrong! I was charge $60 for my $15 burger and $8 Drink.. waiter added 2 extra drinks and a kids meal onto my bill. My friends were visiting from out of state, and the waiter messed up their check, didn't explained to them beforehand that he would be voiding out the first charge and recharging their card for a higher amount before handing it back to them, and because they're from out of state, the bank ending up locking up their card due to fraud, and the waiter had the nerve to ask them \"what you don't have an extra $28 bucks in your account?\" And to top it off, the Manager (after a few times of asking for him), Don Gonzales I believe was his name, finally came out and did absolutely nothing at all to fix this. He wouldn't even refund my friends for the first charge and told them that there was nothing he could do, they were going to be charged twice. It was just such a horrible experience overall, I will never go back! The great view and atmosphere just isn't worth all of the trouble and headache this place caused.",

    "text": "I didn't take in the full effect of this place, but I definitely would like to go back and do that. This was my first experience, and the first thing you notice is the amazing view. Being on a mountain, it provided great views of the city, over looked a golf course and was even nicer once the stars were out.  It definitely had the Old West feel. Walking to the entrance I smelled and noticed the large bull outside. Ahhh Smells like Ohio...at least the part of Ohio I used to hang out in...Going into the restaurant felt like a mine shaft. Wood all around, except for the large jagged rock jutting from the wall on the left and walking up a rather steep inclined ramp. When I emerged at the top, it was really cool. I felt like I was in Paint Your Wagon...the bartender was very cool and pointed out they have free happy hour buffet apps until 6. They had potato skins, veggies and a guy was in the process of changing out ribs for little chimis...He gave me a few ribs before taking them away.  Once my friend showed up, we grabbed a table that provided a good view. The drinks kept coming, and we ordered the appetizer sample that included somewhat rather skinny chicken wings, nachos, and fried mushrooms.   The downstairs had people in the steakhouse...and the steak smelled wonderful! Upstairs in the bar was basically just me and my friend. The waitress came around about every 5 minutes because she had nothing else to do. Not good to be that dead on a Friday night. She ended up getting to go home early because it was so quiet.  What would I do next time? Try the steak. As I said, it smelled great. Try the fried rattlesnake...never had it and I would rather bite one than have one bite me...try that big-ass slide that went from upstairs to downstairs...and after several drinks maybe join in the line dancing downstairs with the live band.   I had a good time here, but there were definitely more to be had. I will give it another go-round in the future.",

Any way, the food was terrible in the fact that it was over cooked (especially the fries). I ordered the Rattlesnake starter as I had never eaten s snake before so wanted to try it, unfortunately, there was barely any snake meat in the dish! It was all batter with tiny pieces (and I mean tiny) of meat! Absolute rip off if you ask me. Anyway, other than the food, the service was just awful! It took 30 mins to get drinks, we were all constantly asking for refills as he would only bring half the table drinks.   At the end of the meal, which had us all exhausted from waiting around, it took 20 minuets to give us our bills, and when he did, they were wrong! After another 15 minuets, he finally came back cards!   On a positive note, Rustlers Rooste is beautifully located high up with give fantastic views of the Valley, but other than this, it's just terrible!   Good luck.",

The restaurant provides a fun atmosphere but our adult guests were hungry and felt that the food lacked in every way.  So if you just want to kill both money and time....this will do it !   It was much better years ago but now they have allowed the quality to deminish.

The hostess seemed stressed and unfriendly, however, we were with her for a matter of 20 seconds for it wasn't a big deal to me.  Don't forget to take the slide down to the dining area!  We were a party of 4 and were seated at a table that was very small!  We had a heck of a time fitting everything and you had to be cautious were your hands and arms reached during the meal.  Over server, Joe, was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  I order \"The Tombstone,\" a margarita with huckleberry juice in it.  It was very tasty, had salt on the rim, and you could taste the tequila.  I recommend it.  The biscuits with cinnamon butter and honey are to die for!  It's their standard bread service along with fry bread.  I had the 16 oz prime rib for dinner.  Salad was served family style first...a little underdressed for my liking.  There was less fat on the prime rib than I expected which was nice.  The au jus added a nice flavor.  I expected a horseradish cream to be served with the prime rib, however, there was just a side of plain horseradish that was enough to clear you sinuses!  The meal would have been a notch up if horseradish cream was served.  The carrot coins came that with it were far overcooked and lacked flavor.  The cowboy beans tasted much more like chili.  The corn on the cob was buttered and juicy, just not in season so I thought a different side would have been more appropriate.  Their menu selection is average.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely request a booth next time!  Take full advantage of the views too!  I would agree with reviews in that food's flavor profile needs work.  Overall, Rustler's Rooste is great for those who enjoy a view with their dinner, but do not expect a huge selection or knock-your-socks-off flavors.",

I ordered it anyway and was extremely disappointing. It was a piece of shoe leather steak that was tough.  Of all the great steak houses in Phoenix I unfortunately chose this place.

We had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.) We started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...) There's sawdust on the floor, and the decor screams \"Disney Design Company.\" All the cliches of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards. When we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what's wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing! This is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there's no possible way it's great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there's a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials. I had discreetly mentioned it was my friend's birthday (because I put the \"B\" in subtle!) I wasn't down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an eclair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle. We went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast. Rustler's Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it's not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!",

A real bull. If you get seated downstairs, feel free to take the SLIDE. Yes a SLIDE. The food portions were HUGE. I could barely eat half my meal. Rattle snake is on the menu with a fabulous cucumber sauce. I got a 'I ate the snake' t-shirt as a souvenir. When the waiter brought the bill, he also brought a bucket of cotton candy for us! How cool. The view of Phoenix from our table was spectacular. However, a bit of warning. Your clothes will smell of this place for a good 2 washings. Walking around the next two days, I would pass people that had eaten dinner at the Rooste the night before. It was quite obvious.",

    "text": "I give them 2 stars because the idea and ambiance is really good. My date and I had Long Island ice teas which were really watered down and it wasn't a great start. Tried the onion rings and they came out burnt.   On the meal she got the filet and I got the rib eye. Her steak was good and cooked well while mine was dry and over cooked. The cowboy beans were dreadfully awful compared to steakhouse or western standards. The salad was watery from too much ranch. The corn on cob was very nicely done though.   Service was slow but adequate. Adrian just seemed overwhelmed by the busy atmosphere. He was really nice though and did what he could to make the experience better.   I would say that you can come here for the ambiance and great views from the patio but if you are expecting above quality service and good you will be disappointed.",

He was very attentive and everything flowed so smoothly. Our food was really great too! Loved the prime rib. 4 of us at the party ordered prime rib \"med-rare,\" and we wanted it to be cooked a little more \"done\" when it came out and he did take them back to be cooked a bit more for us without a problem. He also made sure we tried the cotton candy! Great service. There were very reasonable wait times on Christmas which was really nice too. It was super busy by the time we left. This is the spot for my family on special occasions and we love it here. Request our server!",

To start we received a large bowl of \"house salad\" with ranch dressing that was more like milk, no flavor and the salad was obviously from a a bag of prepared mixture but was limp like it was tossed hours before serving. The bread basket that accompanied the Saks was cold. The bisquits tasted good and were soft but the fry bread was hard and tasted like oil. Now the meal. The steak was poor quality and tasteless and the ribs tasted old like the were reheated from the previous day. The meal cam with corn on the cob that was so over cooked the kernels were collapsed and mushy, the carrots were Akari so over cooked they were dark brown and mushy. Dessert was offered free as it came with the meal but based upon the quality of the other items I declined. This was the worst meal I have ever received. Definitely will not go back or recommend to anyone! Oh, yes the view was nice.",

I must confess that it has probably been twenty years since we last ate there (we are tourists and it's obviously been awhile).   I remember it as being a bit nicer. We were early for dinner so we began in the bar and enjoyed chatting with our server, Haley.   She did a nice job for us.   The potato skins were a very good appetizer.  I'd highly recommend.    We then moved to a nearby table so Haley could still be the server for our meal.   We had a wonderful time visiting with our friends, but I thought the food was just so-so.   (Okay....so the fry bread with the cinnamon butter was the excellent exception.)    I ordered the large filet mignon and it just didn't give me the texture and/or flavor that I was expecting.  In fairness to the place....maybe my expectations weren't realistic.    A country band started playing before we left.   They were a pretty talented bunch of good old boys.   I enjoyed them.   The view from South Mountain was also pretty spectacular.       The atmosphere was nice and comfortable, but the place seems to be really showing signs of wear....but then again, after 20 years...so am I. :-)",

The day of the reservation i got another call confirming the reservation.    I had a table for 10, including visitors from California, Wisconsin and Australia. We all had an enjoyable time, and our Server I think his name was Brennan was amazing and he was training another server, and that did not effect the speed of order taking and food delivery. Great Job.   Food was a bit bland, but that is okay, we all had different dishes, and i did not take many pictures but  the highlight of the evening was the rattlesnake appetizer with cactus fries. The dish looked interesting, we all got to try some, I would say may be have a little more sneak and less fries, but it tasted OK. We were not sure what to expect and when we got it, the batter was so heavy i hardly got any meat on my bite. any way, the experience was great. Waters were filled constantly and Brennan asked us multiple times if we needed more drinks and if there was anything else we needed.   We ordered other appetizers (Nachos, and Onion Rings) and everyone really really enjoyed the nachos. The onion rings were a bit soggy.  As for my dish, I ordered the big burger with sauteed mushrooms, and that dish was amazing. Burger was cooked to order, and I really enjoyed every bite of it. Thanks to your team for a great experience and will definitely come back",

    "text": "Our family of four likes to hit this restaurant whenever we're in Tempe. The atmosphere is fun and the view from the terrace is amazing. The food is typically standard cowboy fare, but the service has always made up for the average cuisine.   Not so during our last visit a couple weeks ago. We joined the waiting list via yelp, which was super convenient. Once we arrived, the hostess estimated our wait would be 30 minutes. It ended up taking twice that long, and the hubby and kids were grumbling and hungry by the time we were seated. In defense of our server, it was a very busy night, and I know she was overwhelmed, but the service was terrible. Our drinks didn't arrive until we asked about them twice, my husband's corn on the cob was dropped on the floor when the food was being served, and the replacement cob did not show up until we were done with our dinner. The ranch dressing my son requested never materialized.   Bottom line: come for a drink and appetizers and enjoy the view, but don't order steak or prime rib. You'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'll start off this review of how we have been to this place every year for spring training.  This was our 5th and last time. Tosh was our server and was quite non-existent the entire meal.  She's the main reason I wouldn't come back. The foods not bad, but as foodies it's nothing write home worthy about. The only reason I gave 2 stars vs 1 is all the other good times we've had there.  Their wait system has come along way as there by is always 30-60 Min wait.  But I want to go back to our service.  We we're sat and the busser dropped waters immediately which was nice but the waters were never refilled.  Sodas were refilled upon asking but we didn't see her again to even ask about waters.  That was the only time we saw the busser. We cleared our own plates and put them on another table to make room.  You would ask Tosh to something and she would disappear for 15 min then walk by with nothing in hand and come back another 5-10 min of what you asked for.  When the food runners drop the food, the server is supposed to serve it. Luckily the manager was walking by and served it instead because Tosh didn't stop by to check on us until we were done. She asked us twice if we wanted boxes.  If I didn't want it the first time, why would I want it the second?  And to top it off, orange cotton candy? Gross. Bring back the grape or original.  Guess we'll just have to find a new regular spot when we come to town.",

    "text": "Came here with my boyfriend for date night and I was pretty excited when we were driving up. Parking was easy and we headed in. First thing I noticed when walking up to the entrance was that it smelled like manure. Couldn't figure out why until I saw the cow in the enclosure literally by the front door. I thought it was kind of cool that they had a little friend there but be warned it does smell a little funky walking up. Walking inside, the place is super themed. It kind of reminded me of one the lines of the rides at Disneyland. I thought it was super cute. They had a live band playing below and that added to the restaurant for sure. I had really high hopes for the food here. I ordered a prickly pear margarita to drink and that was good. It wasn't too sweet and was nicely balanced between the prickly pear and tequila flavors.  For dinner, we decided to share Cowboy Stuff, which is made for 2 or more people. It came with ribs, steak kabobs, salmon kabobs, half a chicken, fried breaded jumbo shrimp, fresh veggies, jumbo potato wedges, bbq beans, and corn on the cob. Cowboy Stuff also came with a salad and a basket of bread, which had biscuits and fry bread. The salad was good nothing special. The biscuits and fry bread came with a cinnamon brown sugar butter. The biscuits were not fluffy at all. They were almost like little pucks. The fry bread was my favorite and it was good with the butter. The butter could have used additional cinnamon and sugar because the flavor was very light. I would say the rest of dinner followed that theme of needing more flavor. Everything we had was moist, tender, and falling off the bone, but it seemed like nothing had any seasoning or flavor. There was BBQ sauce that was on the platter for dipping but that sauce lacked flavor as well so that was disappointing.  The beans were gross. I had one bite and that was more than enough. They tasted like they came out of a can and hotdogs were added to it. One of the two things on the platter than I really enjoyed was the breaded and fried shrimp with the cocktail sauce. That was really good and I should have just ordered a plate of the shrimp. Also, I really liked the fresh orange and purple baby carrot. The portion size was huge so that was a great aspect but unfortunately, the food needed some help.   They have fried rattlesnake and I didn't realize that until after we finished dinner and kind of wish I tried that.",

And if you get stuck parking at the bottom...like me at 7/8 months pregnant...you better not be afraid to hike up the hill. They might have a shuttle but the parking and everything is such a hassle. Second surprise, it's a fun western themed restaurant and they always have a billion people everywhere. Third surprise, there is a slide. So if you are at a table next to the slide you can watch the live band and dancers while getting a million kids screaming down a slide towards your table. Surprise number four: a magician will pester you for money while you're eating and he does really lame tricks. Unless you get the balloon animal guy. Continuing on with the next surprise the food is okay, but nothing crazy great. My stakes haven't really ever been consistent any of the times I've been there.  Think that had to do with the large number of people and parties and private events and patio bbqs going on all at once. Also, the sides are family style. Then here is also a gift shop, a real live bull out front, cotton candy, balconies, a great view of the valley, and so much more. I think it's fun, but too much going on that it hides the fact that everything happening is just meh.",

I even had my mom's surprise 65th birthday party a few years ago which was top notch.  We recently went with family friends from out of state after not going for quite a while. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the quality this time. My mom and her friends steaks were tough. I think the biggest thing we/I was disappointed with was the main dishes only included (along with the family style ranch salad and beans) was carrots and corn on the cob. There is no potatoes options  to go with especially the steaks and no substitutions were permitted.  We ended up ordering the appetizer potatoes wedges with dinner to have with our steaks. I felt for the price of each dish there should be side dish options, and I feel the carrots and corn which were mediocre and no one at our table either ate or finished.  The salad is made with iceberg lettuce which has really no significant nutritional value.  And I always feel makes for a cheap salad.  Overall I feel like the cost of the meals weren't justified by the quality of the sides and flexibility of choices.   The staff were very friendly and as usual it's a fun atmosphere and the view is amazing. Five stars for family entertainment and atmosphere, and staff courtesy.",

    "text": "My friends took me out for dinner, and it was a fun, special night.  We sat at a table by a window on the second floor, and we had a fabulous view of downtown Phoenix, Camelback Mountain, and Tempe.  Our waitress was friendly, and the service was perfect -- not rushed, but also attentive.  She brought bread (biscuits and little fry breads) and salad (nothing special) right away.  I only had one biscuit, but I ate an entire little pail of the cinnamon butter with it, because it was delicious and I have no shame.  I wanted to order the \"Cowboy Stuff,\" which has a two person minimum, so my friend agreed to order it with me.  I enjoyed getting to try a lot of different foods.  The ribs were amazing.  They were served with a side of bbq sauce, which I didn't try because the flavor of the ribs were too good to bother with sauce.  We each got one shrimp, which surprised me (I expected more), but they were enormous and perfectly fried -- nice and crispy.  (I saw the same shrimp arrive batter-free in a shrimp cocktail that came to the next table -- it's really the shrimp that are huge, not a massive amount of batter.)  The fish kabobs were just lovely.  I don't like coleslaw, so I didn't try it, but props to the beautiful presentation -- it was served in a halved pineapple, with huge spears of pineapple as fresh fruit garnishes.  I was too full to eat the steak kabobs (which I had actually planned to eat first, but I was enticed by the other food and lost track), the corn on the cob, the chicken, and the beans, so I will have leftovers tomorrow for lunch, and probably dinner.  Considering the quality of the food (very, very good), I was quite pleased with the amount that we got for the price.  Also, my old fashioned was a surprising color (rather red), so I wasn't sure about it until I tasted it.  It was so good that I commented a few times during the evening.  The live music was entertaining, and the ambiance was fun and moderately loud (my friend who is hard of hearing had a bit of trouble, but not as much as at some other places we've been to).  Being at the window made it particularly special, but I would have enjoyed the evening even if we hadn't had such great seats.  I definitely look forward to my next visit!",

I never left this place impressed and for the dollar, there are a lot better places to visit.  Meal:  I have had the ribs, ribeye, and burger here.  I almost always have a mason jar full of beer!    Taste:  It isn't that the food is bad, but its expensive for what you pay for it.  I wouldn't grade the quality of the meal any better than say an Applebees or Chilis.  It is medium quality food that has been crafted more towards pleasing simple appetites and a board base instead of really striving for something wonderful.  7 out of 10.  Value: Meal is overpriced given the quality of the meal.  Portions wise, its ok.  But if I am paying for near Ruth's Chris or Flemmings prices, I expect better meals than what I received in the past.  2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  I have never had bad service here but I haven't had service that really stood out either.  7 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  This is what makes Rusler's Rooste \"Rustler's Rooste.\"  The views of the city are amazing.  Even though I dislike country, the live bands make the experience enjoyable.  And how could I forget the slide?  I do take the slide to the dinning area every time I go.  And those who don't are schmucks!  5 out of 5.  Overall:  I could take it or leave this place.  I am not upset that I got a meal here, but I am not planning my next trip.  I think the only reason I would go back is if a friend or family member from out of town really wanted a different, unique Phoenix dining experience.  But if you are willing to pay an extra $10 per plate for an exceptional meal, I recommend taking that option instead of going to Rustler's Rooste.  20 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "The service was great and the food was pretty good.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The potato skins and nachos were like the ones at TGIF's or BJ's.  The ribs and prime rib were delicious.  My burger was huge and I was only able to eat half.  The fried bread and cinnamon butter were so good (I had to stop myself after eating two of them to save my stomach).  The strawberry frozen margarita was so good!  Highly recommend it on a hot Phoenix day.    The views of this place were awesome.  The live entertainment (band decked out in cowboy hats, etc.) was great.  There was a dance floor where people were twirling around with their kids.  The kids can slide down a metal slide to the bottom floor, which is really cool.  There was a balloon man who was efficient in making flowers, elmo, spiderman and princesses.  This is a GREAT place for kids.  Kids eat free as long as one adult orders with them.   Also, there was a longhorn in the front of the restaurant and you get blue cotton candy at the end of your meal (like Alexander's Steakhouse!).    Great place!  Would come back!",

They had previously been to the Arizona Grand and they loved every aspect of it. When nightfall rolled around on the third day, we were dragged to Rustlers Rooste, AKA Satans' shitter. The first thing we saw walking up was a cow. The last thing you wanna see before you devour a cows' intestines Is a living cow. Now to the intestines part. I ordered beef ribs and it literally tasted like they pulled out the calfs' small intestines, sauteed them in some hot cum, put them in the microwave for 9 seconds, then dropped them a couple times before serving them to me. Let's not forget how the mashed potatoes tasted like what I assume chum tastes like in SpongeBob SquarePants. I hated this place. Everyone on here is saying the atmosphere is nice and all this shit, when in reality the atmosphere is simply a few sweaty dudes playing awful music while you look at the out-of-season Christmas lights dangling above your bodily secretions. Did I say bodily secretions? Sorry I meant my Rustlers Rooste meal.",

The view from the restaurant is beautiful, as it overlooks all of Phoenix.  I came in a group of about 25 people but since we didn't make reservations it would have been an hour before they could sit us.  So we decided to divide and conquer.  They do have a slide near the inside entrance that goes to the lower floor, though reviews made it seem like it was huge. It's very short.  Live band was decent and a decent volume, not too loud.",

Good thing they have the resort next door to get fresh customers - if we lived here we wouldn't be back.  The steaks were on par with Denny's meat. And to serve boiled carrots and a small corn on the cob with it instead of a baked potato, which you could pay extra for, is just criminal.",

Woud Def go again but more for an event they have or holiday  or with out if town visitors.  The dancing  was cute but blocked a small bathroom (3 stalls)  which their was only 2 of and the place is HUGE ! That kinda was crappy  especially  because my 2 year old and j were waiting for a stall in a cramped bathroom with a bunch of drunk ladies..... NOT COOL!

When it's less busy,  they have a good menu and a good kitchen,  the ingredients and portions are all very thoughtful and high quality.

    "text": "This was our 2nd visit to The Rooste and I was not disappointed (for the 2nd time).  I look forward to seeing Horney on the way in and this time took the slide down to the table. We got there right after it opened on a Monday so we got in right away and didn't have to wait long for our meal either.   The magician guy was pretty fun and he totally still has me wondering how he switched the coin I was holding with the one he was holding without touching me. I even studied it after the trick and it really was the opposite coin. Crazy!  Our server was Kevin and he was really attentive and down to earth. I ordered the filet (got the same last time) and it was absolutely amazing. Very tender and flavorful. I didn't even use steak sauce which I normally do when eating steak.  I forget which cut my boyfriend got but he did enjoy his as well.  We got green beans and a corn on the cob on the side and we ordered a side of mashed taters which for the 1.79 it cost, was way larger than expected. Although the sides were kind of average, the steak itself is what made us come back for more.    At the end you get cotton candy! I love it! The ambiance of the place is really rustic and very country. There is a live band that plays there every night I'm guessing (they played both times we've been) and it was actually the same band as last time because I remembered the lead singer looking like Greg Brady, lol.    The attentiveness was different than the first time we came in (it was a Saturday night) so maybe it had to do with the place not being packed, but maybe not.  I suppose we'll find out next time!  We were seated right next to the window so we got a beautiful view of the valley. Awesome!  I would totally recommend this place to everyone to try at least once.",

    "text": "I can honestly say that I don't remember too much about the food, but the experience. Now that's a whole 'nother story.   Picture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight).   Well, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture.   Once we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying.   Fried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said.   We're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. \"COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL\"   Oh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6\"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit.   This platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie).   Oh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked.

I go out of my way to bring people like Shawn M there for two reasons.  First - Great View!  Second -  the cornball notion that I might actually get one of my guests to eat its featured rattlesnake!   To be clear, I have not taken a bite of the snake...nor will I.  But it would be neat to see one of my guests order it.  This place is pricey for what it is, but the servers were kind and there was enough to listen to and dance to.  It is family friendly but not on the pocket but... you wont leave hungry and you'll really feel like you accomplished something since you need to enter just past a caged steer of some sort that seems to have been captured there for some time.",

Our hosts live in the area and took us to the Rustler's Rooste for dinner.   The decor while gold-rush themed, was very contemporary in a gold-rush kind of way. The staff were very pleasant and friendly. We sat outside on this beautiful Phoenix night. It was 8 PM and must have been 110 degrees. I noticed as we drove around that everything in Phoenix was air-conditioned. I'm glad my hotel room had AC. I bet if everyone in Phoenix turned on their AC and opened their doors, Phoenix would be a lot cooler. Just a thought.   Picture a Hawaii boy in shorts and t-shirt in Phoenix at night, sweating. It reminded me of Hawaii without the humidity. If they had a pool and hula dancers, it would have been perfect!   The food was wonderful! But the best part was the Fry Bread. Yes say it with me, \"Fry Bread.\" One more time, F_R_Y B_R_E_A_D! It's the next best thing since sliced bread. OMFG! This night changed my life forever.   I'm now a certified Fry-Bread-making-fool! Thank you Rustler's Rooste! 5 stars for the F_R_Y  B_R_E_A_D.   Oh and Phoenixians, try the AC and open door thing and let me know how that works out for ya.",

I went there with my wife, in-laws and three 11 year olds.  The kids actually donned their menu (which converts into a longhorn crown-like hat) on their own and went down the slide several times.  All of it (including the fried rattlesnake) is a bit gimmicky, but the gimmicks worked on us.  Their BBQ sauce was very smoky and savory.  I actually would have bought a bottle but forgot to do so before I left.  The rattlesnake tasted like chicken only tougher.  The steaks were cooked as-ordered (i.e., a medium rare = medium rare).  The service was good, and the kids loved having the balloon artist (he made a fire-breathing dragon, an armadillo and a sea turtle).  He was very personable and even provided a one-night warranty on blow-outs!  Of course, we had a nice view of the city, including a lightning storm. Was the food the best I've ever had, probably not, but the overall experience is definitely worth a trip.",

Waited almost an hour for a table(no biggie, it was a Saturday nite).  We ordered our food and one of chose the special that was posted on the table on a placard.  When our 4 entrees came out, the person who ordered the special(my GF dad) got something completely different!  The waitress apologized and said that special was from feb, this order was on MARCH 8.  So when the food finally came(e3 of the meals) the kitchen runner set it table side.  The waitress never came over to disperse the plates of  food, so I HAD TO DO IT.  3 of the 4 ate dinner, while the fourth entree was almost 20 minutes late to make up for the mistake, he had to choose another entree from menu.  The GM came over and wasn't too accommodating, offering a free dessert.  I wanted the persons meal who had to wait comped and he offered a 20 percent discount on it.  I will NEVER eat there again. The food was so-so.  Service was terrible.  AVOID!",

The first 5 seconds of the experience was negative as I was very put off by the poor cow that was eating grass heartily by the entrance to this steak house. The restaurant was a good size but finding a table didn't require a reservation on a Monday night around 8:30.   Also, if you don't like kids, this should be the last place for a choice of dining for you. There was a slide *in* the restaurant. A mob of kids were screaming and running around wild when we came in.  We got a seat by the window, which had a beautiful view of downtown Phoenix. But the service was painfully slow. We had to look around and flag down a server... any server everytime... from ordering to a refill to asking for the check...   One look at the menu.. and again, I was disgusted with the \"fried rattle snake\" listed under appetizers. The food was \"eh\", but not great.   Oh and they had a live county music band...which added to the deafening noise from the kids.  The exit was separate from the entrance so the jury is still out on whether the cow was still up and eating by the time we left. Not to mention the gross display of dead rattlesnakes on the right side of the exit.  If you don't mind seeing your meal alive before you sit down... or better yet, seeing dead snakes around, I still say go at least once.. just for the bizarre experience..",

There are tons of rattlesnake souvenir's to purchase, the slide was a lot of fun going down (the menu tells you why they had one --  it was used as an escape route back in the days), the lights used pans, they used jars for cups, people dressed up, a band, your appetizer plate was a small aluminum plate, etc, and etc.  It was FANTASTIC!  :D   This place is pricy and reservations are highly recommended at a weekend night.  The rattlesnake appetizer was good.  With the cucumber sauce, it.. tastes.. like... chicken, lol.  But I was brave and I tried it and I liked it!!  I highly recommend coming here for the experience and to try rattlesnake!! :)  One side comment, the bull outside the restaurant needs a friend.  I think he's lonely.",

    "text": "Crazy, over-decorated, huge, kitchy, tourist-trap kind of experience. Should preface with the fact that we are vegetarian and were meeting a friend here who has wanted to check it out for a while.   Drove up on a Saturday night at 7pm (apparently can't make reservations until after 8pm) and couldn't find any parking by the restaurant, weren't feeling in the mood for valet, so went down a decently sized hill to the extra parking lot. This resulted in us basically hiking to dinner, up a steep sidewalk with no stairs. Not sure how a family with any disabled or elderlies would handle this. Would have to pay for valet, I suppose. Walked to front door, hit with wall of \"cow smell\", and sure enough there was a HUGE longhorn just chillin out about ten feet away. Walked in, more ramps to hike up, finally made it to level ground at the front desk area. All the hostesses were basically wearing American flags for shirts and the servers were decked out in cowboy gear. We had a hard time getting the attention of the hostess taking names which was a little frustrating. We were surprised to be seated immediately having no reservation on Saturday night, but I suppose this place is SO HUGE that it isn't much of a problem for smaller parties. It took a couple minutes to get through the labyrinth and find our table, on the way passing the oh-so-popular slide that you can take from floor 2 to floor 1.   Sat down and tried to start a conversation, and were immediately interrupted by the triangle-wielding server army that came to the table next to us to sing Happy Birthday. Lots of banging and clanging served for a poor conversation atmosphere, and this was only the first of several birthday celebrations throughout our meal! We ordered a pitcher of the Arizona margarita to split between two people, and it was pretty darn huge. However the margarita was quite disappointing - all sugar and no alcohol. We finished the whole pitcher and felt nothing except slightly ill at the sugar content.  We ordered the one veggie menu item, the veggie burger. Our friends got the prime rib. The meal started with a large basket of fry bread and biscuits with regular and cinnamon butter, pretty standard but yummy. Then the server brought a huge salad for the table to share, tossed with ranch dressing. That was a nice touch that we didn't realize was included. The meal came, and we were pretty shocked to see that it included green beans, corn on the cob, steak fries, veggie chili, AND the burger!! We couldn't finish one meal between two people, and we are good eaters. Everything was good, but nothing special. The green beans seemed fresh though the corn did not. The steak fries were yummy. The burger was good (housemade I believe) but nothing special. Our friend really liked his prime rib. It looked well-prepared and gigantic, just like everything else in the joint. The meal ended with the server bringing a tin can full of cotton candy. Man, they just don't want you to live past 40 around here!!!  For vegetarians who never go to places like this, I'd say we had close to the best experience we could have expected. It is a loud atmosphere and everything is pretty pricy - however, you are paying for a MASSIVE amount of food, so I suppose it works out. Our takeaways: Definitely split a meal, do NOT get the margaritas, and don't come here for a classy place and intimate conversation. You are coming for the experience (and the pretty spectacular view!). We won't be back, but can't say the same for our meat-eating friends!",

    "text": "This restaurant give me a profound case of chronic eye-blech and the only cure for this is severe eye-rolling.  It makes me feel silly being in here, the corniness of the grounds, down to the \"slide\" into the restaurant and the token longhorn out front.  Its one of those places that you smile at your company and pretend that the BBQ ribs are delicious and not massively fatty as if the steer was fed in the corn varietal Cap'n Crunch.  I feel slightly embarrassed as a Phoenician that THIS is the place they choose to host the participants of the Valley bowl games, as it does not represent the authenticity of the gorgeous valley cuisine.  It's beginner Texas Bar-B-Que, which, if its a style you're unfamiliar with, tastes adequate.  I'm not sure I even saw a pit or a smokehouse on the premises, so in retrospect, I would actually think about sticking with the chicken.   But there ARE some positives to Rustler's Rooste.  The views are second to none for a Phoenix-area restaurant.  And they serve Shiner Bock on tap, into a mason jar, and down your gullet.  Their happy hour specials seem really good, and you know, when discussing the matter of your middle-aged co-workers in Friday jeans and hair buns, The Rooste's thematics actually works in a charming way.  As a bonus, you actually get to avoid the throngs of MidWesterners and their children during this time of the day.  Overall, this place is a very uncreative knock-off of Cattleman's Steakhouse in Fabens, Texas.",

The bull in front was fun for the kiddos. The slide was a hit! Kids eat free all summer long!! They bring you free salad and rolls AND free cotton candy at the end of your meal. Not to mention everyone who works there is SUPER nice and friendly!! This will definitely be one place we will miss when we go home! Thanks for making this a place that my kids will NEVER forget!!!",

I've been to the Saddle Ranch many times in L.A. on Sunset Blvd.  This place reminds me of the Saddle Ranch, but less pretentious and less party-party.    Good food...good times...good view.  4 stars from me!!!",

    "text": "Can't believe people are giving high ratings to this place.  Rustlers Rooste was a huge disappointment compared to the past visits.  We waited 45 minutes for a table when sitting in the bar and saw no less than 8 tables empty for 20 minutes and not being bused. They were intentionally making people wait to make the place seem busier.  When i checked on our table the hostess checked the time we arrived then her clock and told me we had 15 minutes more to wait.  She never once looked at how many were in front of us making it clear there was a prescribed wait time and it didnt have anything to do with how busy they were. From our point in the bar we watched in amazement as one of the hostess staff kept pulling a burger and fries from a cupboard to eat while people were waiting to be seated! The fry bread and salad came quickly but then it took forever to get our meals we had to ask twice for a second drink.  When our food did finally come it was just okay.  The burger looked the best but the ribs one of our party ordered was disappointing and the \"steak\" fries were really only one potato cut in four wedges and deep fried - they were just terrible.  And did I mention the forced cheerful cowboy ya'll of our server?  It was clearly faked and odd.  The view is great and the place is fun for kids under 10. That's the only reason i didn't give it a 1.",

It is so incredibly loud you had to yell for people to hear you.  It was so dark we had our phone flashlights out to read the menu.  My steak and enchiladas were horrible.  The sauce looked more like gravy that had a skin on it,  and the medium steak wad so overdone it was black.  Several people in group had the ribs that also said they were too overdone,  ribs should be falling off the bone.  Definitely will never come here again or will not recommend it.",

Ok, maybe impress your  out of town friends with the rattlesnake, but dont go any further. Our meal was atrocious! The \"family\" style salad provided us each a generous single leaf of lettuce and an entire cherry tomatoe...no refills! The bread basket boasted of Indian fry bread on the menu, this however looked more like a turd of some sort, and tasteless to boot, (sorry about the pun). When I ordered up my bone in ribeye, I asked for it Pittsburgh style, the server had never heard the term. (And she wasnt new in the job) I had visions of a thick cut (it did say 20 oz.) of well done prime rib steak.  What I got was a tepid piece of meat that was at least 8 inches in diameter and only about 3/4 inch thick, full of fat and, due to it being served almost lukewarm, the fat was beginning to solidify. In their defense, the green beans were tasty, but I had to wait for our party of 7 to finish eating before making my rounds, inquiring, \"Are you going to eat your beans?\" Yes, I managed to make a meal out of the green beans, since that was the only good thing on the menu. When we left, I noticed 3 tour buses in the parking lot with what appeared to be out-of-towners lining up at the entrance.  I can only deduce that this place is still in business because of its promise of old-west lore and the charm that goes with the scenery and view. I will never repeat this horrid experience. Oh, I did give it one star due to our extremely pleasant young server who was all too anxious to please...but God help her, even she couldnt fix this mess!",

I was off playing with our son, he loved the silver slide, whe our food arrived. When we returned to the table there were those little silver covers on my dinner and son's dinner. Husband was already enjoying his burger. I uncovered my steak and was about to dig in when hub said, \"There is a huge hair wrapped around your steak.\" I looked and didnt see it right away but, BAM, there it was. I wondered if it was mine but it couldn't have been. No opportunity for my hair to get there and not exactly my color. The waitress was a sweet as could be about it and brought me a replacement burger.  The burger tasted amazing but I kept finding bone chips. Gag!!!  Anyway, when we got the bill, the waitress had NOT taken the steak off the bill! What??  My husband asked to speak to the manager and the guy was like, \"You wanna come into the kitchen and look at my cooks? No long hair there!\" as if to say that we had made the whole thing up and planted a hair! Anyway, he ended up taking the darn thing off the bill but I will NEVER eat there again.",

We had to walk down the stairs by the slide to go to our table and one kid tripped and was almost stepped on and another child pushed me oitnof the way. Finally was seated and our waiter otook ten minutes to get our drink order and we received our salads before our drinks! The food was AWEFUL! I am no food snob but my chicken was dry. Oh and if you like your meal decided for you, this is the place unless you want to pay up. Your entree comes only wit sweat potatoes, gross, steamed vegetables, from a frozen veggie bag, and corn on the cob that has been sitting all day in water. Barf. Meanwhile, 2.5 hrs later we were free of that place with a fat bill overy $100. Ridiculous and I'm still hungry. Don't waste your time and money. P.s. views not that great anyways.",

    "text": "I'm a Californian, but I ate here last Friday night when I was in town. I had only been there once before, in 2006, and it was so memorable that I promised myself that if I ever visited Phoenix again, I'd eat there.   I tried so hard to convince my friends, who were in town with me, to check the place out, but they were too tired from all of our traveling. Guess what? I went by myself anyway, as a party of one!  The restaurant sits on a beautiful hilltop with a great view of the city. There's a live bull just hanging out' in a bullpen near the entrance...yes, a live bull, literally, just chillin'! The place is at least two stories. You enter on the top level and have a choice to take the stairs down to the first level, or you can take the slide...yes, a slide, literally. I wish I had that kind of setup in my house. It's magical!   There was a talented live band playing country music on the bottom floor, and there were people dancing. Good times!   I was pleasantly greeted by the hostesses and promptly seated. I ordered the 12 oz. prime rib w/mashed potatoes on the side. A basket of two kinds of bread and two kinds of butter was brought out to me along with a delicious salad. One minute later, my dinner arrived.  The prime rib was PERFECT! The au jus that came with it was unique and delicious. The mashed potatoes were yummy. I had the biggest smile on my face the whole time I was eating. It was all very reasonably priced and high in quality. I had the rattlesnake the first time I went there. You should try it at least once, and then you can buy a T-shirt there that says you ate the snake.   The service was EXCELLENT!  Need I say more? Whenever anyone mentions Phoenix, I rave about this restaurant, and I will continue to do so. I'm also impressed by the fact that it's been nine years since I last ate here and it's still as amazing as I remembered it to be. What a glorious dining experience!",

    "text": "I read a lot of reviews before eating at the Rooste.  I was worried, to say the least.  The reviews I saw were terrible.  My parents, my son and I went together at about 5:30 pm on a Monday night.  Here are the points: 1. Our waitress was attentive and very adorable. 2. We enjoyed seeing the longhorn at the front door.  He was lying down, so his odor was at a minimum. 3. The \"mine\" entrance was fun, and my 14 yo had just toured a mine the day before, so that made it more interesting to us. 4. My son wouldn't go down the slide, but my dad and I both slid into the restaurant.  The little kids sliding there were adorable. 5. The upstairs bar area looked nice, and had a better view, so next time I might opt to stay upstairs and just go for the appetizer menu if that's what they serve there. 6. We were seated quickly at a window seat down stairs by the patio.  The view is good.  We could see Camelback Mountain.  The view upstairs would be a lot better, in my opinion. 7. There were a lot of small children.  A lot.  But they were well behaved and it didn't get too noisy.  Some have complained about the noise, but being early on Monday, the place wasn't full 8. The live band was good and where we were seated it wasn't too loud for talking to each other. Overall, we enjoyed the Wild West theme.  It isn't too overwhelming if you are ready for it.  The view and the theme are the reasons to go to this place.  Now for the food.  Remember that this place is more about atmosphere, and less about the food.  And the food is meant to be simple cowboy food, not gourmet.  It was good for me to start with very low expectations. 1. We were served a bowl of bread.  The Indian Fry Bread was really pleasant.  I would like to learn to make those little breads.  The biscuit was not good.  It was dry and hard.  I ate mine.  It was a waste of space in my stomach.  I recommend skipping the biscuit. 2. A family bowl of salad came next.  It is pre-tossed with ranch dressing.  The salad was fine.  It is like a standard iceberg/red cabbage mix.  We thought it had just the right amount of dressing tossed on.  It was not drenched in dressing.  Thank goodness.  After all the terrible reviews I had meant to ask for the dressing on the side, but forgot. 2. I ordered the Big Burger  It was definitely good.  I ordered medium-rare and it as perfectly cooked, and was large and juicy.  It came with fries and onion rings.  I love onion rings, and I felt the onion rings at the Rooste were very good.  The french fries on the other hand, were just OK.  I didn't finish them because they were not really crispy.    3. My Dad ordered the veggie burger.  It was just OK.  Unless you are a vegetarian, don't get this.  It was more expensive than our delicious real beef burger.  He said the vegetarian chili was good. 4. My Mom ordered a steak and vegetables.  Her steak was medium-rare just as she ordered.  It was big and juicy.  She loved it.   Very good.  Her vegetables were steamed, not seasoned, but she said they were good.  The corn on the cob was good.  Not over-cooked. I wanted to order dessert, but was too full.  I doesn't get a four or five star because the food is western, which to me is rather plain.  There was nothing outstanding or exotic about the food.  Plus it was a little expensive.  $14.95 seems like a lot to pay for a burger.  Although, it was huge and came with a lot of bread and salad...  Overall we had a great experience.  When we left there was a cowboy roping metal calves on the patio, and the band was singing pleasant country music.  I would definitely go back.",

We accidentally left something that was very important to our daughter behind and the staff did nothing, could not bother themselves to help us. It was gone and no one cared to check where we might be able to find it. Too bad, this place has so much potential.",

He spoiled our birthday group and played along with all the jokes.  Great-grandma was ready to take him home with us!  The restaurant is definitely great for families!  With the live Longhorn, waterfall, wooden bridges and of course the SLIDE! We had a blast as well as a great meal.   We started with the rattlesnake appetizer, drinks and fry bread. Our table enjoyed the biggest cut of prime rib, hot wings, fillet, pasta, chicken fingers and ribs. Talk about stuffed!  We celebrated two birthdays with the giant eclair!  They clanged the dinner bell and announced to everyone as well invited them to sing along!  If you have kids and live in Phoenix, this is a must!  Traveling to Phoenix for vacation, make it a point to enjoy the Rooste's Hospitality!",

    "text": "Rustler's Rooste is that triangle of white lights (not the take me to your leader kind) you see on the hills in Ahwatukee at night. You park at the base of the hill or at the top if you are early enough and a van will take you to the top (if you are in heels you may want to wait for that van - although stilettos are best left at home duh). In a nutshell, the place is over the top rustic cowboy; every surface is covered in wood. The food is ok - the bread (biscuits, corn bread etc,) basket is the best part.   You wanna order the rattlesnake? Prepare to shell out $20 for it - let me save you the money. It's little scraps of chicken-like meat (the size of a nickle) deep fat fried and served with chipotle ranch. It literally tastes like dark meat chicken.  There's a live band (we were here on a weekend) playing the old classic country western (imagine that scene in Blues Brothers - Good Ole Boys style). No chicken wire cage though - bummer.   After several drinks (which I recommend) go out on the patio and gaze at the city below. Then after more drinks, push the kids out of the way and take a ride down the slide - dare devils go head first.   Overall - there is much to see even if the food is \"eeeh\" - even the giant beast of a bull in a pen out front, great for tourists looking for a hokey night out, or if your family is in town, take them here and explain this is how AZ is - all covered in wood, stale booze, cowboys and old timey country music.",

First, there is a cow at the entrance in a filthy, tiny pen and it had a bot fly on his rump that had not been tended to.  Second, we got run over by children playing on the slide.  Third, even though we had a reservation, apparently there was a party later that trumped any attention we would be getting from the hostess.  It was so dark we could not read the menus, even the waitress had to pull out a little flashlight to see what we were talking about.  The salad was pathetic, the Indian flatbread was not.  I got a chewy, nasty little prime rib with boiled carrots and a tiny piece of corn on the cob that had been boiled at least a week.  My poor husband got a tasteless, tough filet, boiled carrots that he can't eat and the same nasty corn that he wouldn't eat.  We got the prickly pear margaritas that were not, then a glass of Merlot that was skunky.  Overall, service was so, so, she probably could not see us.  Food was meh, atmosphere was annoying.  Price . . . Overwhelming",

I thought it was pretty neat for the atmosphere with a big long horn outside, the crazy decor, a live band playing country tunes, a big slide for kiddies to goof off on. I could go on and on, the place is just neat in a silly sort of way.  The food was sort of meh. We ordered the rattle snack appetizer which tasted like fried (insert whatever here). I would have to like to have found out what rattlesnake really tasted like, I already know what fried (insert whatever here) tastes like thank you very much. The stuff was like 20 something dollars too, phew glad that work was picking up the tab!  For my entree I had the rib steak. It's wasn't very good quality but it was passable. I thought a place like this would have had better quality steaks though.  The place is pretty cool though. If I ever find myself back in Phoenix with my family I would bring them here because the place is pretty cool.",

The views are awesome too. Last night the food was even pretty good. Husband had steak and ribs, tender and tasty. Our visitor had steak and enchiladas which she said were delish. I had a hamburger with fries and fresh onion rings...burger was over cooked but still very good, the rings and fries were the best!!!",

I know a lot of people just come here for special occasions or to take out of town guests, but I cannot help coming here often.  The view of the valley at sunset is spectacular.    You cannot go wrong with anything beef here.  I happen to prefer the AYCE beef ribs (I never eat more than a plate, but I like the option) without extra sauce at the end.  They're tender and delicious.  And who doesn't like the cornbread or fry bread you get along with cowboy beans (caution: contains pork) for the table.  Every meal includes a salad, the beans, and usually has sides such as corn and green beans or rice.    A reasonable meal for four is around $100 and you leave with leftovers and feeling full.  It's a fun place with a fantastic view.    And, if you're up for it, you can finish off your meal with complimentary cotton candy.",

    "text": "I would've likede to make this a 2.5 starts. I like kitschy places and this place is like Hee Haw on crack! For those under 40, paste this link into your browser:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHee_Haw&s=d55d9e01ddacae6000d8bc0471d71b3add4bfb18061fc1330a09056fee568346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He...</a>  then go to YouTube, watch some episodes, then you will have a point of reference and finally get the joke. The location is fantastic with incredible views. I've eaten here three times and it seems that each time I go, the food gets a little more mediocre. Perhaps the first time I went I was too bedazzled by all the kitschy cowboy-ness to realize the food was not that great. They have a massive stinky bull penned outside complete with the flies going in and out of his nostrils (whom I feel kinda sorry for) Think kid from UNICEF commercial but replace the kid with a bull with massive horns. (Bad joke I know, but hey comedy is sometimes cruel.) There is a slide you can go down. There's a live band playing country music in the center of it all. There are cowboys and cowgirls serving. They have a gift shop where you can buy funny and gross things like scorpion in a sucker and chocolate covered horse turds. Well not really but the sucker is real. You get cotton candy with the bill. A gimmicky whirlwind of Southwestern yee-haw! Good for parties, great for kids, huge corporate BBQ's held in a massive building outside blah blah blah you get the idea. The food: well, kinda underwhelming considering how hard they work to create a fun atmosphere. I have tried the deep-fried rattle snake. Don't bother. It's mainly tiny chunks of tasteless mystery meat  (snake? gopher? lizard?) over-breaded and over fried. You could hack up your worn out Old Navy belt and cook it up the same way with a similar result in terms of food experience. I have had steak, fried chicken and the beef ribs. All were just ok. The ribs have way too much BBQ sauce. The fried chicken was kinda dry. My steak was cooked just right, but sat waiting to hit the table too long and was almost cold.  The last time we went we took my mother and her friend who were visiting from back east. It was around xmas time and kinda chilly outside. It was also pretty chilly INSIDE as the place is drafty and I don't think they even bother trying to heat it. All of our hot food was tepid by the time we strapped on the ol' feed-bags. The salads come out family style and are literally drowning in dressing. The salad however is probably the only item on the menu besides maybe desserts that comes out at the right temperature. Everyone on Yelp is right: that for what you get, you pay way too much. There shouldn't be anything on that menu over $20.00 a plate. It's just not that good. However, the cocktails are good and it is an interesting place to take visitors as I said the view is worth at least one visit. I suggest you head up for happy Hour, have a couple cheap appies, then head down the mountain for a quick drive downtown to a nice steakhouse like Durant's  for the main event. I get the impression that this place has been resting on its' laurels for many years, and has stopped even trying to put out good food. It's slop-n-drop at best.  They figure diners will be too overwhelmed by the Cowpoke Carnival going on all around them to notice the food is meh and the prices are YIKES!! Think I'll mosey on to greener pastures when I got a hankerin' to sink my teeth into a nice grilled slab of cow!",

About three minutes later they said our table was ready! We wouldn't have ordered all the snacks if we'd known the wait would only be three minutes!

They also have a fun birthday package (get a cowboy hat, and HUUUUUGE SLICE OF CAKE) could be really fun for a birthday. They also had live music the night we were there.  My daughter had fun looking at the live bull out front and walking around the beautiful area behind the restaurant. Inside the kids can go down a slide into the restaurant.

Upon receiving our order of the ribeye, the steak was COLD & So undercooked/raw it was astonishing. Because it's dark in the restaurant I put a flashlight to it. It was not medium. It was cold. It was undercooked. We brought it to the attention of the manager who was trying to be helpful by offering another steak yet also nonchalant about it. I was astonished. He informed me he does not accommodate for refunds (because it was partially eaten (my friend hates to waste food) so he brought a petite filet to the table. GUESS WHAT? It was COLD again.  I guess third time was the charm, but at that point it was just disappointing. Moreover, I heard the table next to me expressing the same concern with their steak. They literally said their steak was quite underdone. I understand restaurants can have bad nights. What's worse is both of us got food poisoning and have been sick for the last two days. High temperatures, violently ill. At Doctors. What's so disappointing is the way the Manager handled the situation. He should have returned our funds for the dinner and been more empathetic. Unfortunately will not be back, and I so liked the atmosphere there. it's so disappointing because I heard so many great things long ago.",

This place is packed to the rafters every night and I don't envy them the human game of pinball I watched them play for the almost 3 hours we were there.  We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to be seated.  I am now 100% positive that people go here out of curiosity and nothing more.  The food is sub-par, marginal at best.  They start you off with homemade biscuits with cinnamon butter and regular butter and that is the best part of the meal.  The salad came next and was premade and over-dressed. The chicken was dry and extremely overcooked.  The ribs, well -- Lets just say the McRib has better flavor.   They too, were overcooked.   The filet was a baseball cut and not bad, but for the price, not worth it.  I doubt they do a lot of repeat business here.  If only the food were 1/2 as good as the staff.",

No one told us our reservations were outside in the fucking barn.  There were flies and the smell of cow shit everywhere.  We didnt get bread until 15mins AFTER we sat down.   We didnt get salad until 25mins AFTER the bread.  We didnt get drinks until 10mins AFTER the salad.  We didnt get silverware until just before the food came.  ALL THE SILVERWARE WAS DIRTY. Dried food and dust particles were caked on the silverware.  When the food did come, the steaks were undercooked, the turkey was overcooked, the gravy was salted so much it burned.  We are NEVER EVER coming back. The service was terrible, the management didnt care, the atmosphere was god awful. Would give no stars if possible.",

They come with a family style salad and sides. We also decided to get the potato skins. That wasn't the best idea because I also ordered a NY Steak and it came with corn and additional sides and I was completely overwhelmed and stuffed. Second, the scenery is unbelievable. The restaurant is literally built into a rock on top of a giant hill and overlooks the whole city. Incredible. Third, get a margarita. They are delicious and strong. Fourth, they give you cotton candy at the end. HUGE WINNER Fifth, live country music. AM I IN HEAVEN?  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that when you walk in and leave you are greeted by a bull pen. There is a poor cow there giving you eyes of judgement and I felt guilty after the steak.",

I understand it was busy, but you need people who know how to keep their cool and can greet everyone with a smile.  Besides that,  the food was delicious, atmosphere is great.

    "text": "We dined here on a Saturday evening, while attending Spring Training (nearby.)  This joint came recommended, and although I'm giving a median score of 3 stars, I DO recommend that you try it.  Here's why: We were seated immediately for a Saturday night, of course, we came EARLY (5P.)  By 7 of course, this place was NUTS! Our server was VERY quirky.  I am not going to reveal his name, because quirky to ME is kind of fun, but he DID not bode well with others at our table.  A little TOO tongue and cheek so to speak, but I thought he was kind of cool. Our drinks came right away, but server did ask to take our order a second time, after he had already punched in our drink order (no big deal, and BETTER than being forgotten entirely!) He was very thorough in explaining complimentary sides, and what was available by ala carte.  He did NOT necessarily recommend the rattlesnake (which my Husband insisted on), and it was MEH at best.  The cactus fries were good, the rattlesnake I think was a 2 oz. portion, and almost ALL breading.  NOT recommended! We all ordered steak OR the beef ribs.  He was EXACT in explaining that the beef ribs are HUGE, but have little meat (they were \"all you can eat.\") The beans were a little \"weird\" my Husband thought hot dogs, but I'm thinking sausage was the meat.  The salad was pre-dressed in a DRENCHING of ranch like substance, just no. The fry bread and the biscuits were just fine.  Even though I EXPECTED people at our table to completely dismiss the cotton candy provided post meal, we ALL rejoiced. Here's the thing:  The ambience was FUN.  The view is outstanding, and our table was along the upper deck windows, overlooking the dining patio.  The sunset was amazing, and we would return again just for that.  WORTH a try, just go with an open mind!",

If you go downstairs yo the other at, only two small tables. Not sure where one would go to listen ? The diner area is ok, good is good. I'm not sure i would go back, the main reason was yo listen to the band .  Came back 2nd time    Had a drink at the bar . We were told can't make diner reservations until 4:45. They make you wait inline instead of placing you on the list as you arrive and sit in the bar. Then the hostess still won't put your name down until she had her light on.

    "text": "First time in AZ and was told this place was pretty good despite the 3 stars they have we said why not.. we did the wait list via yelp said to arrive by 6:30 for party of 3 we arrived 10 minutes early checked in around 6:15 told we would have a 30 minute wait. The wait area which is basically where you check in can get a little overwhelming especially since it was a busy night so you have bodies amongst bodies waiting of course unless you can go to the bar area, We were seated around 7:10 not bad pretty close to the time we were quoted...  So here's where it got to me I happened to look towards where the server was walking caught him kind make a face and say yo himself why ? I took it as why do I have these people at my table, I gave him a look  like I saw that and his face was like oh I was caught but I kept it cool and under wraps didn't want to make a scene plus we were hungry and didn't want to have it ruined, so we ordered and politely would say thank you when needed since we're not rude people and can imagine how a servers life can be at times serving people, maybe he had a customer that was rude or stingy in their tip or didn't tip at all... who knows  The food... they start you  off with some bread  and 2 kinds of butters, yummy! Then you get a salad  which was tasty also, then comes the main course the chicken was flavorful and not dry at all the steak was cooked well as requested all and all food was delicious, then you get topped off with cotton candy which is complimentary for the meal. We ordered for dessert the sundae but the ice cream didn't fill some parts of the cup so it looked empty in certain spots but it was yummy so we didn't mind..  All in all the food was great the service was fast the place had a cool vibe and they have a slide for the kids, the price is reasonable not pricey at all, the band was cool so the only thing was the servers face and the wait area.. my daughter said not to tip the guy. It i couldn't do that this is his job but i think if you can't keep your facial expressions to yourself especially since you chose a job to serve people maybe this isn't the gig for you..  I'm giving 4 stars   for the food, and the cool looking place they have..",

The bartenders are nice. It is very much set up for tourists. It has what I call, \"A tourist propaganda story,\" about it being a rustlers cabin in the old West and the slide is for the rustlers when they fled the law. The tourist eat it up. Actually it was build, I believe, in 1976. Tourists come in from the bus load. The Japanese tourist men are especially funny thinking this is the real West.

I tried it and couldn't chew it.   I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken and it was TERRIBLE.  DRY!!!  Ate three bites.  My daughter ordered a cheeseburger which was okay.  Fries were cold.  We all had the salad which wasn't anything special.  Head lettuce with their \"own\" ranch dressing.  The biscuits were dry and cold.  The green beans were cold and mushy.  The corn was cold.  The baked beans were gross.  The fry bread was good.  After waiting an hour for a table, I'm convinced that our food was sitting under warmers, hence the results.  If we'd been wasted, as many patrons were, we might of thought the food was acceptable, but we weren't.  Also, the bull in the front of the restaurant didn't exactly help my appetite. The smell was unbearable, even inside.  We will NEVER go here again.  The restaurant was cool and the band made the atmosphere but the food was simply BAD!  The view was really pretty.  *We didn't complain to the waiter simply because we didn't want to try ANYTHING else.  Figured we'd pay and NEVER go back!",

Not only can you see almost every location of fireworks from their outdoor veranda, but if you have the right seat, you can dine and watch from indoors as well!   My fiance and I love to swing dance and it is typical for a waiter to come by to deliver our food and we are off on the dance floor, swinging to live country music.   I do love the free biscuits and fry bread they bring, as well as salad. And the drinks come in mason jars!   Basically, this place is an experience-not just a restaurant.

It was the most inferior fillet ever served   YUK! Our guest ordered a medium rare New York strip.  It was served well done. Our guest was too polite to complain.

The live music, slide into the dining room, and gigantic bull outside all combine to make this a unique adventure.  The  views from the outside patio are stunning and it's a good place to take hyper, fidgeting kids to let off some steam before or after dinner.    The steaks are good, though I can think of a few other restaurants that have better.  The rolls and fry bread served complimentary with your meal are excellent, as are the cowboy beans.  Service can get a bit backed up a times so bring a little patience if you're going on a weekend or holiday.   Overall, this is a fantastic place for a family dinner!",

    "text": "So, I've lived in the valley since 1996 and I just had my first visit to the Rooste. My friends were in town staying at the resort, they invited me out, so up the hill we went.  First impression-stinky cow by the front door...? Yuck! Our wait was about 5 min. Not bad (it was a Thur, around 8). Our table was great, the view of Phoenix was awesome.   As for the food... first they bring out a basket of strange little flatbread things that weren't very warm. Almost like hockey pucks. Then out comes a salad with wilted iceberg lettuce that is covered in ranch dressing. Not great either.   Everyone at the table ordered steak. My friend said her tenderloin was really good but I didn't taste it. I ordered the sirloin, it tasted good, it was tender, but it was just barely warm. It was obviously sitting in a warmer, and I would have liked a fresh cooked steak better.  The meal came with green beans, which I didn't even taste because they looked awful, and corn on the cob which looked like the little frozen cobs you get at the grocery store. The best part of my meal was the baked potato. It was delicious.  We ordered a kids meal sirloin and the steak was cold and tough.The kids burger was decent.   Now, the end of the meal was the strangest thing I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The busboy comes and motions to us to hand him our plates. He proceeds to dump ALL our food into the salad bowl, utensils included!! It looked just plain nasty. SO weird.   Now that we are finishing up, the THREE kids are asking about the cotton candy they keep seeing go by. I tell our server we will take 3. She says \"you only get one.\" I say \"well, then we will purchase 2 extra.\"  She says \"you can't buy extra\" I'm like fine whatever. I'm all about kids sharing, but you're out to a nice dinner.. maybe a special occasion.. give each kid a cotton candy for cryin out loud.   Then you leave and pass the stinky cow again. Fun. If I was staying at the Grand, I'd pass on this place and hit the Claim Jumper down Baseline....",

    "text": "My fiancee and I were looking for a decent steak or slab of prime rib last Friday night. To ensure a table, I called Thursday and made a reservation with a resounding \"Sure thing!\" from the girl on the other end. After arriving and giving them my name, however, they said it would be about 45 minutes until we'd be seated, and that they \"don't do reservations.\" Apparently, it's more of a waiting list, so whoever took my \"reservation\" probably should've said something.  A bit miffed, we sat in the bar area being bombarded with a deafening roar of country music. I had to yell to the server that I wanted a Blue Moon, and she said they don't serve it. (Really? It's a full bar; at least get bottles.) About 7 minutes after getting my sad replacement, our buzzer luckily jumped to life and we were off. Evidently, my unintentionally blurted-out comment of \"WITH a reservation?\" to the hostess after she told me the 45-minute wait-time suddenly made the line much shorter.  On our way down to the table, we kept bumping into kids who were literally running up and down the staircases and crashing into the hostess leading us. (The look on her face was priceless!) Apparently, people just let their kids run rampant through the restaurant and nobody tells them not to, and that's just normal -- you've been warned.  We were relieved to find that our table was along the edge of the restaurant, right next to the windows overlooking the valley. It was a bit quieter over here and the view was great, but then we realized our server hadn't seen us and it had already been 8 minutes or so. Isn't the target goal to make contact within 2 minutes or less as wait-staff?  She seemed overworked and was taking quite awhile to come back and take our order/check on us throughout the night. She was still polite, though.  We had a coupon from their email club for a free-ish appetizer, so we chose hot wings. Some random dude brought them out to us and couldn't tell us which were hot and which were mild. As it turned out, 10 of them were hot and 2 were mild; go figure. They were okay; nothing to die for and I definitely wouldn't pay $10 for them.  The salad was dismal. It was pre-bagged iceberg mix with some sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh-from-the-box croutons. I tasted zero dressing whatsoever and wound up using the leftover ranch from the wings. The biscuits were a bit dry and needed butter desperately. The frybread was actually tasty, but the cinnamon-butter it came with was really unexpected, and the flavor combination with my meal once it came was awful.  My fiancee and I both ordered the prime rib. The prime rib itself was decent (again, like the wings) but I've had much better for less money. It was tender but definitely past medium, which I ordered. It was pretty dry, too. There was no juice even puddled under the cut. Any True fan of prime rib sees this as a warning flag. Sides of seasonal veggies were blah; overcooked and needed salt and pepper. Their tacky, little pot of ranch beans just tasted like hot ketchup and brown sugar. We barely even touched them. Corn on the cob was waaayyy over-boiled. Pro-tip: Fresh corn on the cob only needs to be boiled about 3 minutes. Any more and you're killing it.  Portion sizes were huge, but I would've much rather had less food and actually enjoyed it thoroughly. Large portions at average quality make me kinda feel like I'm being bought off as a customer. The worst part about that is they're still charging you a lot of money for the average quality you get.  With children running by us every 2 minutes and jumping all around the booths without anyone telling them not to, we got fed up by the end of our meal and had enough. Check took awhile to get to us, but again, our server was polite and apologized. I get the feeling either their management needs to be more proactive or someone didn't show up for work that night.  PROS: - awesome, valley-wide views - live country music with dance floor - seems like a great happy hour place - polite server  CONS: - no reservations and is absolutely PACKED on weekends; be warned - average food at steakhouse prices - big portions of food you won't fully enjoy - kids (like, not one family's, but a ton) running around everywhere like they own the place  BOTTOM LINE:  Feels really touristy and tacky and forced. Another restaurant pretending to be a casual steakhouse but sacrificing quality food for a family-restaurant atmosphere. Might try it again on a weeknight, but I'm not exactly dying to go back.",

When the best part of dinner is the magician who does card tricks, I guess that tells you what you are paying for - it ain't the food.   We ordered the rattlesnake and zucchini sticks for apps, and they were average.  While we were eating, a funny magician stopped by our table and played a few tricks on us, and it gave us all a laugh and some old school entertainment.   I had the filet, and it came with, green beans and another side.  I have to say, my dad can cook a better filet than this place.  My steak was very bland, and didn't taste like the steak I was expecting.  Not for the price.  The portions were huge, and the experience was fun because we were in a large group.  Unfortunately, it wasn't due to the food. The view from the restaurant is amazing!  You look out over the city and out into the mountains, and it is very serrene.  They have live music, and even a slide that gets you down to the restaurant.  It's fun for kids and adults.  So, when the company is paying, take a trip to Rustler's Rooste - you'll be in for a good time.",

When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training.",

    "text": "My husband and I recently got married and are unable to afford going out often. We wer ever excited about going to Rustlers Rooste and had been saving to go for a while. We were very excited about going. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed. We went on August 16th and we were a group of four. We had called ahea to make a reservation. We were on time and second in line, the hostess seated at least 6 groups/couples before us. We were finally seated at a very small table near the window. We were so confined and when asked if we could move to a larger table to have a little more room we were rudely told they are reserved for larger parties (there was no reserved sign on the table we requested). The waitress came and took our drink order as well as appetizer. The waitress was kind and professional. As we got our bread and rattlesnake the table behind us all got up and were causing a stir. We noticed a huge cockaroach on the wall. It was disgusting. My family assured me at probably just came in from outside and it was fine. I was still appalled by it. I did, however try and continue eating my bread. That was when I found a hair in my butter. I understand accidents happen but I was about to pay a lot of money for the food I already ordered, that I thought maybe it would get better. We ordered burgers and chicken and the enchiladas. Everything was bland. There was no flavor, the \"chicken that will make me forget the Colonal\" made me wish I was eating fast food. We were all extremely disappointed. We hardly ate any of our dinner. Thee were too many patrons who seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves to cause a problem while we were there. We paid our bill and altogether we spent over $100. We were walking out past the gift shop and it smelled like feces and gross food. After leaving all four of us felt ill. I am not sure how you handle these things but I am looking forward to your response. We will not be returning and I will be posting this email on several different sites.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to Easter brunch for a few weeks since we made reservations. I would usually prefer the Hyatt Compass room, but we thought we would try something different for the family and guest. Unfortunately, it was a mistake. We were met with a very long line, after we finally got to the hostess desk we were asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating. We opted for outdoor seating and were lead to a dirty, rickety picnic table in full sun. We asked for shade seating, only to be told they were all reserved. We had not been asked when we made the reservation if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating. Despite all this, as it was very loud inside we thought we would try the outdoor seating, and were told we could move if it became too warm in the full sun in our Sunday best. At first it didn't seem too bad, we went in and got our food, ok selection but some fairly rude servers who would glop food on the plate, not caring where it all went. After about 20 minutes it was becoming too warm in the full sun, we were waiting for a family in the shade to finish and leave. When they had left we asked the server if we could move to that table, since we had been seated in the sun the longest and were quite uncomfortable. To my disbelief the waiter said we could not be moved, as they would surely be seating someone else there shortly. About that time we noticed another waiter helping his already seated table move to the table in the shade. My guest ordered coffee and it was brought to her in a soda cup, with the explanation that they did not have coffee cups. She could not drink it as the glass was too hot to handle. We had made 10:30 reservations in an effort to make sure we would be there early and have better service. As it was too warm to continue to sit in the sun we did not enjoy any further food or dessert, chose to pay the check and leave. The waiter actually had the nerve to complain that he still had 8 hours of his shift left! It may be a kitschy place to dine and have a great view, but do not count on any degree of service to the customer. It was by far the worse dining experience, and very embarrassing for our guest.",

The restaurant is located way up on a hill, and walking inside is a chore for her.  There aren't any steps, but just because someone isn't actually in a wheelchair (she can walk small distances), doesn't mean they can walk up very steep ramps.  When we finally got up to the check-in desk, we were told that our table would be located on the bottom level.  We requested a table on the main level, because I didn't think my mom could make it back down that ramp.  They were very kind and changed our table.  The food was ok - think of Rawhide without the town - food is basically the same.  You go for the food and atmosphere - not just the food.  Steaks were cooked correctly, drinks were refilled and service was attentive and pleasant.  If it weren't for the hastle of trying to get my poor mom up and down the ramps, we would probably come again, but sorry, just not worth it - once was enough.",

We returned to the hostess when the restaurant dining opened and were told to pay our bar tab and wait by the railing.  We did that.  We requested outside seating, but were told by the hostess that she \"didn't have her sheet yet\".  Not sure what that meant, but we were not seated at any of the many open tables outside.  Several parties were seated out there  as we dined inside and watched.  We also sat and watched as all the tables around us were served bread, but we did not get a bread basket until we were 1/2 way through our entrees.  Two people in our party of 6 were brought the wrong meals, so rather than giving them the option of eating the mistake or waiting for the correct meal, the incorrect meals were whisked away..  We were told we could only put  everything on one check....which is ridiculous! They seemed kind of angry that we even suggested  a check for each couple.

The casual attire is nice, kids love the slide, my daughter loved looking at the city lights also, workers are very hospitable all in all one of the nicest places I've been to and I would love to go again whether its for another family outing or just my husband and i.

They all \"annoyingly :)\" followed the rules and you can clearly tell it is well managed.  We got a mix sampler and as always the food was fantastic.  We had a huge plate of food neither of us could eat half of and it was around 13.00 (i can't remember exactly)  As we worked the event the staff worked seamlessly to put on a huge event for 400 people.  Wasn't the only party there that night.  I was impressed and I recommend big events there!  Jana",

    "text": "Very disappointing! Made reservations for dinner of a party of 4 for a window seat in order to view the fireworks throughout the valley as they promote on their website. Confirmed reservations per their calls 3 times to be told by the manager that we still had to wait 30+ mins because they only take reservations of 8 or more and mine is considered a soft reservation; meaning I'll get first consideration for the next available table. My question is why confirm and take if not honored upon arrival? Manager was rude, condescending and didn't seem to care that this was our first time. As for viewing all the valleys fireworks shows; well if I would have brought a telescope then yes you'd see them. The service was not bad considering how busy our server was but the pricing was a bit high for what you actual received in portions. The patio does offer a nice view but definitely not one that highlights the entire valley or the various firework shows. I will not be returning or referring anyone. I'm a former regional restaurant manager and would replace the current Manager immediately he is not customer focused or accommodating, let alone polite. My current job entails hiring nationwide and relocation,as well as, recommendations of various restaurants and this will not be one that I add to my list. Very disappointed in the entire experience! They're too many others worth spending your valuable time and money.",

    "text": "FUN vs. FLAVOR ( the lowdown on Rustlers Roost)  1. They do not take reservations!  What they do take is ONLY a call ahead.   Apparently, guest are viewed like cattle they need an estimated number of how how many are coming so don't expect to be seated for a while even with a call ahead. But like good cattle hearders they real then in and out pretty darn good.  2. This place gets  stars on fun but not food- at best mediocre. The nearly foot long piece of cake adds to the table fun and is generous on the calories.   3.Atmosphere -The American stage with live western style music, the games, the  \"honey bull\"  that sits outside watching guests leave, the motif -  rustic and the well thoughtout option of stairs or a slide for those who may have endulged in a drop or two too many of the libations seated on the second floor was genious or a suggestion of a seasoned drinker.  Lastly, the spectacular view from the patio provides a lasting memory that will impress any guest   4. Staff with an attitude - reminiscent of  the Old West as portrayed by Garrison Keillor stories In the Lives of Dusty and Lefty. They are True American Characters.  5. Cleanliness - ABOVE average from what I saw on July 4th 2016 while they had served 1,700 people that day it was very clean.I couldn't find a dirty spoon or glass and I pride myself on spot checks.   6. Management approaches you with caution like a Sheriff from an Old Western Town that John Wayne might have played portraying a sense of fairness with a reasonable but not too accomodating attitude.  Passerby and Locals alike need to come here at least once to  experience a bit of The Old West and Tourist to Arizona need to ink this into their itineraries.  Price is about a 3.5 stars",

If you want to kick up your heels there's country music every night. The restaurant portions are GINORMOUS. On a recent visit I actually shared the burger & ordered a side of the best bacon jalapeno mac n cheese. Every entree comes with biscuits, fry bread & their amazing cinnamon butter, a salad, veggie, beans, corn & potato. So you will not leave hungry. The table also gets cotton candy for a sweet ending.They have beyond giant portions of delicious cowboy food.  Can't beat this for a special occasion with the fam, romantic views for a date night or an event. This place can hit all of the marks for a cowboy steakhouse.",

Maybe it's the incredible staff; we always ask for Brooklyn and she always takes great care of us. Maybe it's the huge portion sizes. Maybe it's the great value. Maybe it's the view, which as a phoenix native, I can say is the only one like it in the entire city. Maybe it's the live country band. Maybe it's the perfectly smoked meat or the signature barbecue sauce. Regardless of which one of the many reasons we keep coming back, we absolutely hands-down love this place and take every single one of our out-of-town guests here and will continue to do so. This restaurant, brings me back to my childhood days, when Phoenix was the still the old west. There is really nothing quite like it left in this city. It's rare for a restaurant to be around for so long and do such a consistent job, but this place gets it. From top to bottom, inside and out, this is truly a gem.",

Thank goodness we skipped lunch and were all so hungry we just made do. Had I not been with a large party I would have sent every single item back. It was that bad. The steaks were awful. You couldn't tell the difference between a filet and a sirloin. The rice pilaf was disgusting. The burgers were over cooked. The salmon was dry and tasteless. The best part of food was the rolls, salad & bread. At the end of the meal I hated signing on the line for that $590 meal. Worst food we have had in AZ out of all of our trips here!",

Went in for my daughter's 18th Birthday- party of 5- you might think after telling the waitress it was her birthday that she might actually wish her one.. nope:(  Food was warm at best and none of our steaks came cooked as ordered. Waitress was too busy to come back and check on our meals- bring steak sauce and more bread  ( ask asked for) or refill drinks. Also I would've liked some paper napkins on the tables for all of the fat I needed to dispose of that came  with my Prime Rib. But.... if you like bagged salad- carrots and corn that tastes frozen.. beans that are overly sauced and over cooked steak- you might love this restaurant. Nothing has any flavor! The quality of food for the $$$ price tag was ridiculous as stated by many other reviews here. On a positive note, 2 people in our party ordered the burgers and said they were great! That poor bull covered in flies on the way in... the smell of poop does a lot for the appetite- NOT!  Manager took 20% off of the bill and did acknowledge that the steaks looked over cooked. Worst experience! SO SO sad that owner/management doesn't care enough to respond to any of these reviews....",

As my husband put it, it is a glorified Denny's.  The hostess was short and sort of dismissing.  Understandingly there was a huge party coming in (3 tour busses full of senior citizens), but that does not grant her the right to be rude to other patrons. We decided to wait at the bar since she said there would be 30-45 minutes wait for our table.  I was not even 1/3 of the way down my lemonade when we were called (less than 15 minutes away) and got rushed to our table.  The place was very noisy (a big turn down in my book) with lots of children running around unsupervised.  Our waiter took his sweet time to get to our table (almost 10 minutes).  He was sort of pleasant, and he graciously took our order.  I am guessing that because of the super large party, the food took a while to get to us.  Apparently the servers are not supposed to serve the dishes to the table, it just gets delivered.  Our waiter took a few more minutes to put our meals on the table and by the time I got to our steak, it was kinda lukewarm.  The beans were really yummy, but the carrots look over cooked and soggy.  Presentation is not their forte.  At the end of the meal we were treated to a yummy bucket of cotton candy, even though we had ordered dessert.  All in all the experience was not bad, but I would not bring any friends visiting to that restaurant, and I would not go there again.",

The drinks were fruity and refreshing, with The Clooney Margarita having a nice balance of easy to drink and bite to it.  When the food came, the portions were enormous. I had difficulty finishing a fraction of it.  Best fish I've had, better than either coast. The steak was juicy and soft, and the beans and corn were some of the best I've ever had.  Here's where I speak on the mashed potatoes.   They were legendary. I've never had any their equal. Such a flavorful dish is rare. Garlic, butter, salt. All the usual suspects, but in a balance you've never quite experienced. Art. Do not pass up the mashed potatoes.",

All the staff was kind and courteous.  It might be a little to tilted toward tourists but the night I was there there were a ton of locals.

First, the parking is kind of crazy; I asked a guy I assumed was valet about spots that had cones blocking them off and he told me they were for VIPs, all throughout though, then I saw people sliding him money - solved that mystery.  The menu is pretty limited to steaks, so I thought they'd be great. My family ordered ribs, 3 filets and prime rib. Everything was barely lukewarm. The cuts of filet were odd, and we know because my grandfather was a butcher from the south. They certainly weren't your traditional center cuts.  It's pretty pricey, and that wouldn't be bad if the food quality were indicative of the price - we actually eat out often at a $20+ per person price point. Also, the service was horrible. Our server had no knowledge of the menu and always seemed overwhelmed - even though her other tables seemed fine - all three tables (us included) we in different points of service. Plus, tables as far as we could see never seemed to get cleared off. The worst part, the AC was not good upstairs, it felt better downstairs, but I don't want to sweat while I'm eating.  I'd have to agree with a review I read before going, it's more of a tourist trap. Not for a family in my opinion. Maybe a fun place to grab a drink and appetizer, if there's something that appeals to you. Otherwise, a great steakhouse it is not. Gotta pass on this one.",

One of plates of food was even dumped on the floor as it was being served, the new one was made rather quickly but was served cold, then it was double charged on the bill and I had to ask for the remade food to be removed from the charges. We had a large group and not one of us at all of the food and not because of the portions but due to it being inedible (don't try and eat the corn on the cob that sat in a pot all day) The salad had so much dressing it was a sloppy mess. The kids eat free meals do not come with drinks but don't expect the waiter to tell you that when you order, and the juice refills for the little ones are not free but they will keep refilling them without letting you know until the bill comes. We had 18 adults and only 4 small kids in our party.     It was a terrible experience and will not recommend taking family here for a special occasion again. I completely understand how hard it is for a large group and I would never expect anything but friendly service and this was just so bad.",

Almost didn't know there was a band, except we saw them when we walked in! We sat a party of 12 at a table that would seat 8 comfortably. The chairs were wobbly and VERY uncomfortable. Start to finish was 2 hours & 9 minutes long. I am still waiting on getting my glass of water refilled. The one we sat down with was the ONLY one.  We told our waitress we were there for my friend's birthday and she asked if we bought the package. We said no, we didn't know. She said she would go & get a pamphlet. That NEVER HAPPENED! We were never offered deserts. I see some people were posting \"you get cotton candy at the end, for the table\". We saw that many times! NOT US THOUGH!  Both my wife & I ordered the Cowboy platter. The beef was so tough that I could not chew it!  When the waitress brought our food, we had to make room for her to put down this basically cookie sheet. Our plates were literally hanging off the edge of the table. She acted like we were in her way. I was born & raised here! I have been here many times. I haven't been here in the last 15 years or so, though. WOW, sure is different. I am saddened!! Because of that night's experience, I will now expressly recommend against going to the Rustler's Roost restaurant!",

    "text": "This place was an absolute blast!   We were staying at the Arizona Grand so we were dropped off and picked up by the shuttle from the resort.  Very Convenient!   Walking up there is a Huge Bull who's name is Horney! Fitting as he has two HUGE horns...  hehe. ;) The smell was less than appetizing, but then again it brought me back to the country a bit..  And well that is the theme of this place.  We got over it as we walked in!  The Restaurant is decked out Country!   We all enjoyed entering the Restaurant on the slide, YES I enjoyed entering the Restaurant on the slide!  I would have kept going, as all the children were doing, but I was reminded that we were in a restaurant so I acted appropriately (aside from the first slide where I literally shrieked with pleasure!!.) My daughter did suffer a bit of rug burn, but she got over it!   So we sat down and ordered our food-  the girls ordered Spaghetti and Macaroni (I did remind them we were in a Country restaurant and they could have BBQ!? But they were in the mood for pasta, ok!) Their portions were very generous!   Boyfriend and I shared the dinner for two, which came with a bunch of options.  Ribs, BBQ Chicken, Shrimp, Swordfish, potatoes, cole slaw (served in half a pineapple), beef kabob, etc... you get the picture? It was A LOT of food.  $21.00 per person but it was a LOT of food. Tons of Leftovers!    OH did I mention that we ordered the Rattlesnake App?  We did, it was delish.  They are cooked kind of like pop corn chicken with a chipotle sauce.  And they deliver it with part of the snake bones for \"show\".  It was good, we would order it again.   It was Khaira's bday so they gave us an option of dessert, they serve cotton candy so we stuck with that.  It was a great way to end dinner!    They also had a live band playing, which was great for a week night! It was a very fun experience. Beer in a mason jar, and a fantastic view!   The best part was that we happened to show up on kids eat free night- so the girls' meals were FREE!!!  Nice surprise!!     We will be back!",

There is a huge slide for the kids enjoyment.  There is also baloonatics and magicians that go around to your table and entertain you.   It's extremely fun and I highly recommend this to anyone.",

However, never a problem when you're grumbling for a great feast! I was skeptical at first, but the first thing I fell in love with was the bread they bring out. Not the biscuits, but the actual bread itself!! I always want to go back and just get a large order of their bread. It's sweet and just the right amount of chewy, doesn't fall apart. The cotton candy is an added extra ;) it's my fiances favorite place to eat out of everywhere we've been. We cannot wait to return!",

When you first arrive you're greeted with 360 views of the valley. It's an excellent spot to take some pictures--especially at sunset.   We were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant after a trip down the slide. We had a great view even though we weren't right beside the window. That was nice. I hate going to a place with great views and staring at the back of the kitchen all night.   We started with the rattlesnake and cactus fries. I'm glad I tried these unique offerings but I'm not sure I'll try them again. No trip to the Rooste would be complete without them. I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious. My husband had a burger and his parents had pork chops and prime rib. The cowboy beans are the best I've had. Everyone left happy with a full belly and leftovers to spare. The beer is reasonably priced and served in giant mason jar \"pitchers.\" The best part is that every meal ends with complimentary cotton candy.   This is a great place for families and they have a full bar for the adults. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Phoenix and if you live here, why haven't you visited already? Say \"hi\" to Horney the Bull!",

From the moment we walked in through the entrance door it was like going on a Disney ride. Even though the place was packed the hostess sat us right away by a window with a view. The hostess took us to our table, on the way there you can either go the the stairs or go down the slide, of course my 30 year old daughter and I chose the slide while my husband took the stairs and took pictures of us having good old time and laughing hard as we slid down.  After we sat down the waiter greeted us and took our drink order, a minute later someone brought us a big bowl of salad, basket of biscuits and fried bread to share. I ordered the pork chops, every bite I took I was in Ecstasy!  My hubby and daughter ordered the Filets and they enjoyed it too. My hubby said he can cut it with a fork it was so tender. After dinner they bring you a bucket with cotton candy in it to share. Did I mention they have a country band playing while you're enjoying your dinner and looking at the beautiful view! We had an awesome time and if we travel to Phoenix again you bet your a$$ we'll be going there again.",

Finally an hour and 25 minutes later after 2 times asking what's hold up we finally get table. There are 5 vacant tables for 2 and 2 vacant tables of 4 within seeing area where we are seated and there's at least 30 people still waiting for tables. We ordered 2 Pepsi's from our waiter while looked at menu. Short time later finally got 1. Then had to flag down another waiter to get other. Waiter for our waiter to come back - finally another waitress shows up to get our order. We order there 2pd porterhouse to split with salad and loaded baked potato. First we get large bowl of salad that is soggy ( water in bottom of bowl) and salad isn't even fresh. When we finally get porterhouse it looks more like a small T bone. I'm gonna guess it was maybe a 20oz tops!! So I tried to cut it with steak knife to give half to my wife and the steak knife wouldn't even cut it -- I basically ripped it off bone with my fingers. The baked potato was still hard and cold -- the butter wouldn't even melt when put on it. Also our meal was served to us now by our third waitress of the night. In closing had we had 2 beers and 2 mixed drinks at bar for total of 35 dollars and both mixed drinks were 99% sprite and 1% crown! Definitely not a place I can recommend. I believe my wife also wrote a review on this place!",

An entire tray of food was dropped (not Bobby's fault). So when the new tray of food got brought out everyone had their food but me. I literally sat the entire meal watching everyone else eat. My food finally got brought out as everybody was boxing up theirs. So I ended up boxing up mine and taking it home. I will say Bobby was amazing with the drinks. With that many people he was smart and brought out two at a time per person. Also the check was incorrect 4 times. By the time we got done sending the check back because of things that needed to be fixed, it was almost $100 difference. It was embarrassing that I had suggested we go there for a great experience and my parents, who picked up the tab for all 15 of us spent more time making sure the bill was correct then enjoying family time. They tried to compensate with so much dessert, that everyone went home with chocolate cake for days. It really is a good restaurant and we might go back again but never with a party of more then like 4.",

The fried Chicken was succulent and moist.  The beans were tasty and the corn, perfection!  Everyone in our party loved it so much that we went back a second time during our week long visit.  The people that work here are very nice and really go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience.  The lady that was making balloon hats, etc. made a spectacular Elvis, that was just amazing!  There is a slide for the kids that goes from the second to the first floor, yeah, adults had fun too :)  The live music was well played and fit the venue.

I played it safe and didn't order steak because the reviews were so bad; I had the Garden Veggie burger which came on a white bread bun with tomato, lettuce, something I couldn't identify because it was so dark in there (they were beans) and then some overdone french fries.    As a group we got a huge bowl of salad which would have been better without a creamy dressing but it redeemed itself because there were cukes and cherry tomatoes.  Our waiter never refilled drinks and getting someone's attention in a dark, noisy place is hard.  I can't believe anyone would rave about this place.

Although not the best steak I had for 24 bucks you get bread, salad, steak, potato, corn, carrots, and baked beans. Pretty solid. Beer in mason jars. Just a fun local place. I'll always come back when I visit",

I called today to say can I get on the wait list I was driving over now and I am 15 minutes from you. Nope can not do that. My grandson arrived ahead of us and he said I would like to get a table for 3. Nope, the whole party must be present to get on the wait list. So he asks how long is the wait? 60-80 minutes unless you sit at a picnic table outdoors.   I have been in the restausant business most of my life. This is no way to run a holiday meal. Nothing scares away customer more then a 1-2 hour wait. I will never come back nor ever speak of you again Mr Rooste. You are dead to me now. I am thankful for other options today.",

Luckily we had a great server who took care of me after explaining my medical issue. The food you got a lot of it, but it was just \"eh\".

My three friends who had the fried chicken ended up really sick a few hours after dinner with food poisoning and are still recovering. My partner also got sick from the food the next day. My ribs had no meat. It was like they dipped the bones with BBQ sauce and cooked them. It was so disappointing. We paid way to much money for bad food. No one deserves to get as sick as three of my friends did.",

Sadly though the food was honestly terrible.  Guys - how do you screw up BBQ beef ribs?  What was that nasty mess?  It was as if you attempted to make a hybrid of beef jerky and BBQ.  These things were so dry, it was like eating an old shoe, and they hardly had any sauce.  I'm not hard to please with beef, I'm a frequent diner at the Sizzler and they put you to shame.  Also, were those carrots canned?  They tasted canned and they were small and weird, as if they'd been in a can.  I notice none of the colleagues I dined with finished their food either.    All in all a really cool restaurant with absolutely terrible food.",

The sides werent very appealing, boiled carrots and bbq beans, didnt eat those. But the desert was fantastic! A cookie with ice cream...sooo good. They were also giving free cotton candy but im not sure if thats a regular thing or just because they had too much left over for the night? We passed.   The atmosphere is fun and very country-like. Live music plus a slide to go down to the 1st floor....so cool! We'd come again but we'd be more careful about ordering and skip on the rattlesnake and sides.",

I went here for dinner with 3 other adults and I must say, there really is a nice view of the valley from the restaurant. Other than that...well. As advertised, it is a themed restaurant with a live \"country\" band.  We were seated at a table with 4 chairs and we were very crowded with a condiment holder, butter, rolls, appetizer plates and drinks. Our legs under the table were also crowded. When the sun set it got dark in the restaurant fast with just a few high lights and a candle on the table. Had to read the menu by cell phone.  The potato skin appetizer was a simple with cheese, bacon and green onion. The dish could have been served at any chain restaurant. I ordered the beef ribs with the standard \"family-style\" accompaniments (salad, carrots, corn on the cob and beans). The others with me ordered pork ribs, fried chicken and a steak and enchiladas. The beef ribs were \"fall off the bone\" to the point that they were probably boiled or steamed. One of the ribs was a little \"gamey\" tasting but the 2 others I ate were decent tasting. The BBQ sauce that was drizzled over the beef ribs wasn't meant for beef (too sweet) and was also on the pork ribs that my wife has. The 1 steak that our table did order was cooked correctly. The pork ribs were overcooked. I didn't try the fried chicken. The carrots were overcooked and unseasoned. I thought the beans had a good southwestern kick of seasoning but others at the table didn't care for them.  For the location, I would have liked to see a restaurant that is more focused on the food and diner comfort then the western theme and unique quirks (no were did not order the rattlesnake).",

The view and patio are also great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the meats we were served at the luncheon. The steak was more than well done and the chicken was dry. I know if I came back to the restaurant and had the chance to order something else, I would be happy. Also, for some reason, I couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi. I would have loved to post on social media that I was there but my phone wouldn't connect.    I want to come back sometime in the evening to enjoy music, the view and the company. I will return!",

( A Gordon Ramsay moment) Haha!      The waitress was quick to correct the problem, they definitely made sure it was cooked! The burnt salmon was evidence that they resolve the problem ha ha! I understand they're really busy, but at least make sure the food is cooked, A suggestion maybe clean the broiler often!! Everything had a burnt taste, IMy hamburger tasted like it was cooked directly on the coals,,         Love this place,,But clean the Grill !!!!       O, PS.   Ask your bus boys , slow down , they where literally running around and plowing through Guest. . Just Saying,,",

    "text": "Heard about this place from my sister. As a person that lived in Phoenix most of my life, I am amazed I had not heard of it before, but better late than never!   When you first walk in through the main door, you feel like you are in the most awesome mining cave going up towards the dining room on the second floor. Once you get there, the dining room really opens up to all the western decor seating and bar areas. This place is huge! We went in on a Saturday right after opening (best time to go) and there was live country music playing. One thing I truly appreciate is the fact music wasn't too loud and didn't drown out the conversation between me and family members.   On to what we ordered: We were brought fresh biscuits and Indian fry bread (Absolutely delicious). Appetizers- Fried mushrooms and zucchini logs (which were super good), authentic rattlesnake and prickly pear cactus fries- this was actually really good! The rattlesnake tasted like chicken to us and the prickly pear cactus fries were really tasty.   Dinner Entrees- First, it's good to note to come hungry. Dinner comes with a family sized salad and if you are ordering ribs or steak, also comes with corn on the cob and cowboy beans. We ordered St Louis Style Pork Ribs, Big Burger, Impossible Burger and New York Steak. I will say everything was really good! Mom loved her burger, the ribs were falling off the bone and the rub on the ribs is absolutely amazing. The impossible burger is a vegan burger which I wasn't impressed with but maybe it's just not for me (but a great option for Vegans) and the New York Strip Steak was cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of seasoning.     We truly had a wonderful time here, it is a beautiful place inside and out. The views and the food from this restaurant makes the drive to get there well worth it. Will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "We were in the area within the last few weeks and decided to stop by for the first time for happy hour (Monday-Friday 4pm-6pm). As we walked in we went down a hallway that felt like a cave. We were greeted by the hostess and asked for a booth but she explained that they were seating all customers in a certain section of the restaurant at that time. It was slow so we were seated right away.  We began looking over the Happy Hour menu which was pretty weak. I believe it was $1 off certain food items? My boyfriend ordered a Coors Light (bottle) for $4.50 while I sucked down free waters. The waitresses carry around a huge mason jar full of water for refills which was really cute!   For an app we ordered Frank's hot sauce wings. We also ordered the cheeseburger chipolte ranch which had jalapenos on it. It came with a side of french fries. The burger was very tasty while the french fries were bland and tasteless. Our meal also came with biscuits, indian fry bread, a huge dinner salad coated in ranch dressing, and bbq beans. They also brought out cotton candy for free after dessert. It felt like we were eating at a buffet! All the sides were tasty and I loved the salad.   We had a lot of leftovers to take home and for all of that food we only paid $31 before tip! The views of the valley from our table were also amazing. While we were there during the day I would also like to check out the view at night as well. Service was decent and we will likely return in the future.  *They also have a slide, full bar, music (not sure during what hours), shuffleboard, and arcade games.",

We ordered the rattlesnake and not only were there so few of pieces but they were hard and overcooked. Not tasty like the first. The pieces were also so tiny. I then ordered the shrimp dish and it was no good I was so sad and disappointed. It doesn't help that the place is kind of dingy and smells weird. Beat thing about it is the view but honestly you can get a great view at many places around town.",

I get it, you're serving tons of seniors, but my ribeye was just boring. The onion rings were VERY over cooked. A few of the others had a burger n fries, nobody was thrilled with their food. Having a 12oz burger just so you can charge $16 is a joke. They were over cooked and also flavorless. How does a restaurant not have cheddar cheese?   With the growing fantastic food culture growing in Phoenix, I probably won't be back.   But can you beat these views?!",

We called to make a reservation and were told they could not book us a table and it would be better if we arrived a bit later, as its a family restaurant and families with kids dine early. We arrived at 9 pm. The host was friendly and sat us immediately. We were close to a window and the view was stunning. I was excited to share this place with my friends. our waitress was a disappointment.  she dragged her feet and made it very clear she did not want to be there. She was not friendly or attentive. She did took the order and left. Did not come back once to see if we wanted more drinks, or if everything was well. The food was ok. By 10 pm they turned off the lights near us and we noticed all chairs were up near by. we were obviously not welcome.  Very disappointed and embarrassed after i told everyone what a great place it was.",

    "text": "My family and I went for their Easter Brunch today.  Overall I give the brunch 3 stars.  The service was good, and although they do not take reservations per se, they did have an online preferred seating system which we took advantage of -- we waiting only 15 minutes to be seated.    In general, I thought the brunch was OK, especially for the price.  But there were some things that were good and some things that were average at best.  Let me try to summarize.  They had an omelet station which was OK.  Standard offering and nothing exceptional.  Other breakfast foods were OK -- bacon, sausage, potatoes, etc.  They had something called diablo eggs, which was their version of eggs benedict.  Instead of ham they used chopped beef with bbq sauce....I thought it was OK at best.  My eggs were hard boiled which is a negative, since they are supposed to be runny.  And the sauce on top had jalapenos in it which was OK by me.  Other things like mac and cheese, chicken fingers, beef bbq ribs, chicken Monterrey, etc. were only OK.  Salad bar was rather routine with no outstanding salad offerings.  The only seafood dish on the whole buffet was what they called shrimp cocktail ceviche, which was citrus marinated veggies with a few pieces of chopped shrimp in it. I expected more seafood offerings; at least some fish dish or something.  The carving station had three offerings -- roast baron of beef, smoked brisket, and baked ham.  All three were pretty good.  They had creamed horseradish and au jus for the baron of beef; rum raisin sauce for the ham; but surprisingly they had no bbq sauce for the brisket.  The brisket was good and not tough (but not super tender either), but was rather dry without any sauce or bbq sauce.  As for the roast baron of beef, I liked it very much.  It was a huge roast haunch of the beef, and it was rare!  I love rare beef, but for those that don't like it that way, you might have been disappointed since I would say that 90% of it was rare.  Lastly, a few comments on the dessert bar.  While there must have had at least 20 things on the dessert bar, my family and I sampled only a few of them.  My daughter said that her choc fudge cake was good (it looked too heavy, dense, and rich for me).  My wife had a custard Danish and she said that was OK.  I took a slice of regular cheese cake with a choc cookie crust -- that was good.  I also took a slice of strawberry cheese cake and that was nasty.  The strawberry glaze was bad, the cream cheese filling was frozen with ice crystals in it and tasted bad.  I also took a slice of what I would called walnut cake (sorta like a banana nut cake) and that was excellent.  Oh yeah, the last comment I have is that they only had one cooked veggie on the buffet -- steamed carrots.  I found that a little strange.",

From old time triangles clanging, to live country music to an actual steer outside, I've never seen anything quite like it. What a gem. Its a fun and rustic place, no pretentious people should come here. I give the atmosphere a 5 and the food a solid 3.  My prime rib, while tasty, was a bit tough. The sides were all good, corn on cob, sweet potatoes, and dinner salad.  Was offered (but declined) complimentary cotton candy as a desert. Kids would love it.  Service from 3 different people was all excellent.  While here there was a private event on the spacious patio so that was bad timing. Would love to come back and sit out there some day.",

To begin with they limit your side choices (which are plain carrots and corn) the steaks were over cooked, and the Mac and cheese tasted like straight valvetta!!! Service was good but for the price we paid we expect better food. Hope this helps improvements!!",

    "text": "First, the food. I ordered the bone in ribeye. That is my go to at every restaurant. My sides included sweet potatoes and green beans. I also got the sauteed mushrooms. Dinner also came with rolls and fried bread. The mushrooms were drenched in so much oil and the garlic was so overpowering. I love garlic, but I ordered sauteed mushrooms, not garlic oil. The main thing I came for was disappointing. The bone in ribeye was tough. I had a hard time chewing the pieces lol. I always have leftovers and the meat off the bone is usually so flavorful the next day. Not this particular steak. There was hardly any flavor. Even the steaks I make at home has flavor the next day.   Next, the parking lot. It can get pretty packed and some people don't know how to park so they end up taking 2 spots. I used to drive a full size truck and never had a problem parking it. People who can't park in between the lines should be forced to drive smart cars. I had parked at the bottom and walked up. Lemme tell you, I hike and that walk up is steep. It took my breath away. I don't know how ppl out of shape do it. There needs to be a better way to manage parking. Maybe offer complimentary valet and force everyone to valet. There is a sidewalk on the left side but the trees and bushes are unkept. It's like a frigging jungle.  Finally, there is a pretty bull hanging out in front of the restaurant. I didn't really check him out before I ate, because I didn't want to. I did take a look at him as I was leaving. He was very pretty. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge steak eater. Maybe more so than any cowboy. But I'm not sure it's a good idea putting a bull out there. It may turn people into vegetarians lol. I know the restaurant has done this for years, but I never really paid attention, or maybe the other bulls weren't as pretty. Times are changing...",

Ok no problem then the manager added that he would not be able to split the check it would all need to be on one check...

    "text": "THE AMBIANCE - 5-stars Let's start with the reason to go, the ambiance. This place is cool, and fun. You get to ride a slide down to the dining area, there's live music, we were offered balloon animals, the whole place is themed, there's a live bull outside, there's a gift shop, etc. We came while entertaining some family from out-of-town, and entertain it did.  THE FOOD - 4-stars The four adults ordered the Cowboy meal (a bunch of stuff for $25/person, all brought out on a platter for the table). The food is tasty. The ribs, in particular, were mouth watering. Our chicken was a little dry. We might have had better luck with dark meat. The salad was just a salad. The potato wedges were nothing special. Not too shabby.  THE VALUE (PORTIONS & PRICE) - 2-stars For $25/person, or $200 for us for the night, including tip, I expect to go home full. None of us did. We all left wanting a little more food, which makes the value quite low.  THE SERVICE - 1-star The service here was complete rubbish, from start to finish. When I called to make a reservation, the host was snooty, condescending, and couldn't wait to get me off the phone. Once we were at our table, we rarely saw our waiter, who was not nice, talkative, expressive, or present. I asked for a refill on my lemonade and never got it. Rustler's Roost adds a mandatory gratuity to \"large\" parties (we have 6), so he was getting a great tip even with crap service, and he knew it.  THE VERDICT - 2-stars The service made the experience bad enough for me that I will never chose to go back, not recommend it to visiting family. If someone were to pick it themselves, I'd likely go along, but otherwise, the horrible horrible service experience, and leaving hungry, and paying $200 for all this, was enough to overshadow everything fun about this place.  Would not recommend. Won't be back anytime soon.",

It is not the best steak place I have ever been to, but I have always enjoyed the steaks and the prime rib is very good as well. When in season you can get rattlesnake bites as an appetizer, but I prefer the fried mushrooms. Service has typically been friendly and fairly fast.

    "text": "I went to RR with my 5 year old on a daddy daughter date night on Saturday.  She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.     I ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.  Our dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.  When we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entree and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.  Did I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.  Overall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree.",

I think I'd rather go somewhere that values my business and treats me like they appreciate me being there. If you want great food with horrible service, I highly recommend this place!!!",

Well, now that I am an adult, I finally understand why no one ever wanted to go to Rustlers Rooste but me. This is not the kind of place that you go to for the food. This should be a drinks only stop. The food was below average and took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. We ordered our steaks medium, they came out lukewarm and bloody. Nachos were generic, tasted like they had been microwaved to melt the cheese. Several tables around us made complaints and sent their food back. I will say that their saving grace is their fry bread, drinks and view. After \"dinner\" we were able to take our beers outside on the patio and watch the sunset. It was beautiful to see the valley from the top of the hill so at least the night was not a total waste.",

    "text": "Growing up in Tempe, I've been to the Rooste a few times. Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.  One of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.  My next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.  If you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had. The view and atmosphere is what makes the restaurant.",

For about $20 a person, you get ribs, steak, chicken, fish, fries, corn, and sides. Plenty of leftovers since you will be snacking on the Indian fry bread. The staff are always friendly and service is fast.  There is live entertainment and very family friendly. A great place to take out of town visitors.  I recommend making reservations if you want to sit by the window which has the best view.",

The corn on the cob was more like creamed corn on the cob, been in hot water a long long time!  Their cowboy beans were average at best,  My wife had the all white meat fried chicken, fairly good and lots of it (3 breasts with the bone deep fried) but we had to ask for some gravy twice and then received half a shot glass of tasteless milk and flour white gravy, enough to sparely cover one breast.  The salad needed more dressing but was refreshing.  Best part of the meal was the Indian fry bread. The green beans were semi cooked and unseasoned.  The place was extremely noisy and on top of that a band played in the background.  I left with a headache and a resolve to never return for a $40+ meal.",

    "text": "Went to the Rooste for a Christmas Eve dinner among a small group (9) friends. I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe.   Been intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is True. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet.   You pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring.  First stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star.  From the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans.   Moments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed.   Our waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20.   While waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic.   The food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice.   All in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal.   I highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.",

    "text": "My wife and I were very disappointed with our experience at Rustler's Rooste last night. We were there to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary and our visit there was our first experience at the establishment.  We ordered the big cowboy dinner platter that came with many different options from the menu. Our fried shrimp were burned, the ribs were the same way. The fish kabobs were raw and the beans were cold. The coleslaw, the fresh vegetables and the dipping sauces were warm as if they'd sat under a heat lamp the whole time the rest of the food was being cooked. All of this food was served on a bunch of warm, wilted lettuce that made the dish look unappealing to even eat.  Our waitress did an ok job. She was busy as it seemed like she was attending to too many tables so it took long periods of time to get to us. Not her fault. We should have said something last night but our waitress was so busy that she didn't have time to come over to ask about our meal so we asked for the check and left.   Having spent $22 per person on this meal we expected much much more. Yes, the view of the valley was great but the meal and the service received a failing grade from us.   I submitted feedback to the restaurant through their website last night and received a call this morning from the manager. I was impressed that he called me back so quickly. He asked if we would give the place another chance so that they could make it up to us and offered us a VIP experience AT A DISCOUNT.  I called my wife and asked her if she would be willing to go back to which she replied \"No Way\". I asked the manager for a refund instead of the opportunity to return and his response was that they do not offer refunds. I appreciate his attempt to make things \"right\" with a discounted meal if we were to come back but pretty sad that they aren't willing to make things right with a refund.   I hadn't planned on writing this review until after speaking with the manager and hearing that they do not offer refunds for a horrible experience and that he wanted to have us back for a DISCOUNT, not a complimentary meal. No need to go back and spend more money on a poor quality meal.",

    "text": "In my opinion, one of the neatest restaurants in the valley that doesn't get enough pub. Yeeeehaw!!  Located on the top of a little hill in the middle of the Point, you get a great view of the valley. This is a Western style eatery, with a real bull sitting outside pretty much every night. Gives it the \"authentic\" smell i guess. When you enter, you can decide to choose the \"fun\" entrance, which is sliding down this slide instead of walking down the stairs! haha...I loved that, definitely makes you feel like a little kid again.  There's a nice live band playing on most of the nights, so pretty lively place. When you get to your seat, it's in these traditional wood benches. Along the floor, you have the typical western style hay thrown about. Nice touch to it.  Their menu selection is the classic Western food. If you are adventurous, I recommend trying the Deef Fried Rattlesnake as a starter. They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake, which is also deep fried. Meat is nothing too unique, just a tad bit chewy, however very neat presentation.  The rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food: steak, beans, etc. After a hearty meal, I recommend standing outside the patio (when the weather is cooler) and enjoy the view of the valley.    If you are looking for really high quality food, you probably won't come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food. However, this place gets excellent ratings for the atmosphere. Perfect place to take any guests that visits the Valley for the first time.",

I don't recommend going at the end of the night cause you'll get looks from workers as if they want you to leave (felt a little rushed and awkward). AND I actually recommended going there and took family tonight with kids and mentioned the cotton candy we can get at the end so the kids were excited about it, to come to find out that they turned off the machine so we couldn't get any. Which I would think if you see we have 3 kids with us you could make at least some for them before closing. But I guess it was just bad timing. recommended but not 1- 1 1/2 hrs before closing.",

    "text": "This review is for the newest waitress at this establishment. This was my daughters 4th birthday I read plenty great reviews on this place to help me choose this place to be her birthday dinner. We walk in see the bull the kids were excited we took the slide down to our table they absolutely loved that and then we get to our seat... We sit for awhile (10 min) waiting for someone to come over and the girls have to go to the bathroom so they leave to handle that I sit for another 5 minutes before the new waitress stumbles by and finally notices me. Asks what I'd like to drink I give her my order and tell her it's my daughters birthday and I'd like to order the birthday package (cake, photo, hat=$15)  yes that's right $15 for something other restaurants do for free. Anyways I order it while my daughters in the bathroom she said ok I'll go write it down right now I say thank you and we move along with our night. We had a decent dinner great band kept the kids happy it was sort of busy so we were patient with the waitress who mentioned she was new when we asked how to get the free meal for kids that's printed on the kids menu to ask the server about the free meal lol she had no idea. My daughter order a hot dog and fries it took 20 minutes to get ketchup but like I said it was busy so we were patient anyways they brought out our check brought out cotton candy I paid the bill and waited.. After 20 minutes or so after paying the bill we finally see the birthday song coming in our direction I pull out my camera to capture the special moment and it stopped a table before us hahaha jokes on us after they got done singing he waitress walked over asked if there was something else I needed I asked if they were still going to help us with my daughters birthday celebration and she started to apologize and say she completely forgot which is ok because like I've stated twice before it was busy and she is human so things happen she then asks if we still wanted it or if we just wanted the cake lol I respond I mean if it's alright with you id still like more then just the dinner for my daughters birthday thinking I had already paid for it .. By this time both my kids heads are on the table from being tired it's 9pm and they have school/daycare tomorrow so they come back 15 minutes later sing the birthday song give us the cake and take the picture our waitress says they will be right back out with the picture and again apologizes for the mix up and keeping us waiting I say it's ok ask for a box and box up the cake because my little one was being crabby as you can see in the video so it was just best we left. We're headed out and the waitress runs up and gives us a new ticket saying that she updated the price since she forgot about the birthday I'm thinking how nice of her to fix her mistake lol she updated the ticket and charged us for the horrible celebration that she forgot. Listen in the video as they stop in the middle of the song to ask her her birthday then asks how old she is . I told the lady she could get the manager because I wasn't paying for it and she responded Rudely saying \"well I guess I'll just pay for it out of my tips\" I left her $12 on the original ticket yes you should have to pay for your mistake the worst birthday dinner I've ever seen. Great establishment but horrible waitress we will not be back. Sorry for the rant but she bummed a very important day for us. Did I mention after talking with the manager he apologized for her and also mentioned we don't get a hard copy of the photo like she said we just get to download it off their website lol the strangest $15 bday package I've heard of.",

Probably one of the best views of the Valley and big outdoor patio that is great for photos.  Cons: the food. Ugh. My burger was overcooked and the bun was hard. The fries were barely warm. My husband wanted a steak for his birthday which he described \"was okay once he reached the middle.\" Vegetarian friend was served Mac and cheese with meat in it but server was very apologetic. Other friend said her beef ribs were pretty good, but, all in all, very overpriced for the quality of food. All that saves this place is the ambiance which, for some people, is enough.   I personally, wouldn't return.",

    "text": "This is a great place to go with your family. They have pretty standard, average food, and lots of gimmicks.  First, the place is huge. It is two stories, and each floor has a bar. Downstairs, they also have a little stage where a live band plays and there's a dance floor. After you are seated, you are given a basket of complimentary fry bread and biscuits, which are pretty delicious. They have lots of choices on the menu, so even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. That being said, there's lots of meat and potato type dishes. You get a family-style premade salad with your meal which is a pretty standard lettuce/tomato/onion/crouton/ranch salad. Ours was cold and the lettuce was crisp so I really liked it.  The portion sizes are pretty generous. We ended up not being able to finish our meals.  We had a couple of cocktails from the bar, and they have alcohol versions of limeade which are pretty delicious and reasonably priced, for alcohol. When you get the check, you will receive a complimentary spool of cotton candy.  The restaurant sits up on a hill, so it has pretty good views of the valley and if you get there at the right time, you'll see a nice sunset.  I wasn't expecting anything truly extraordinary from this place, because I had read the reviews beforehand, but we went, it was packed, we had pretty decent service and decent food so I have no complaints.  If you're expecting a fancy schmancy steakhouse, this is not your place. It is a family-friendly, loud, casual joint which I think a lot of people would get a kick out of.  Oh! Also. If you are staying at the Arizona grand resort, there is a shuttle which will run you up to the restaurant and will pick you up after. That was a great convenience.",

    "text": "We've been a few times and think it's a fun place to bring people from out of town. I honestly felt that the steak quality was no better than Outback, but at least they have ambiance and live music. AWFUL PARKING THOUGH!! Use the valet, it's totally worth a few bucks (they work on tips).  The sides are good sides, with big portions. They charge a plate sharing fee, which covers the all-you-can-eat salad and beans. Salad dressing is excellent, and I like the biscuits (not so much the fry bread).  But I had to knock them down from 4 to 3 stars because I called ahead at 7pm and was told I was put down for 7:30. We arrived at 7:20 and weren't seated until 8:00 and that was after talking to the manager. The manager tried to tell me I \"can't hold him responsible\" for the delay. I'm sorry buddy, but responsibility always falls with the manager, especially when there were tables open that the hostess was trying to reserve for 4-tops even though we were waiting a half hour past our reservation.   Once seated we had a great server, and the manager did stop by and apologize at the end of our meal.",

The sides are average at best. Green beans overdone, rice is tasteless, the only thing worth mentioning was the salad was actually decent!  BUT...Only have ranch dressing or oil and vinegar. Really?!  Finally, the view is spectacular, but doesn't make up for overpriced food with no personality.  Service was mediocre at best.",

Much to my surprise when our checks returned and each and everyone of us had been charge incorrectly we realized we had a problem.  To make matters worse a \"manager\" came over to \"help\" and insulted the young men and women at the table and was very condescending; if he only knew that each one of the young people have professional jobs as pilots, teachers, and brewery managers.   And to further insult them in front of their parents and grand parents - very bad customer service.  Too bad, this place has SO much potential, it really is a Phoenix ICON, yet it has lost something - it is now just a cheap imitation of a steak house, with poor customer service, catering to tourist.  I would like to add a positive, the General Manager did attempt to make things right and did his best to sort the mess out...  I compliment him on his effort at trying to make things right, too bad he even had to do that in the first place...  The food was eeh, the appetizer of rattlesnake and prickly pear fries was the best part of the meal...",

Its a shame as it is a great property but I guess they believe they continue on due to bus loads of tourists that are overwhelmed By Being in AZ and the view and Not knowing they are getting served sub par food and service.

I see why so many past reviewers said the sunset was to die for!  We started off in the saloon for happy hour.  Discounted prices on their appetizers ($3 each) and a brewsky.  They serve all the adult beverages in mason jars which added a nice flair to the place.  The zucchini logs were to die for...  I was looking forward to dinner!  I ordered the top sirloin that was \"prime\" that they had highlighted on the menu.  It came with homemade rolls/biscuits, family style salad for the table to share, green beans, beans (tasty!) and corn on the cob.  The steak was cooked perfectly (rare) but I didn't feel that it had too much flavor.  Don't get me wrong -- I still ate almost all of it!    My favorite part of the evening had to be the magician that came by our table.  He really was entertaining and had me mind boggled  in the 5 minutes he was at our table \"tricking\" us.    Definitely will be visiting the Rooste again!",

    "text": "Oh man.. well overpriced drinks, and small portions (including on drinks) makes me laugh. One person in my party got crown on the rocks, i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses.  RIP OFF!  The view is good (not great), the bull is real. the servers are good people, the atmosphere is typical for a steak place. That is where my positive experience ends.  While scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix, it was nice to see all the \"mountains\" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah. not really mountains to me). Back to the important part everyone...the food. They were greatly overpriced...well my first thought was okay priced high food must be great!...hmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed, well they need to give a bunch of refunds.   The burgers my friend got, looked dry and zero character. It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburger..you know that dry fake looking one. Obviously the burger wasn't that huge, but it looked lame. The pork chop was also VERY dry. Like yeah, i know we are in arizona and most things are dry, but leave the food out of it. It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it. Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible. I got the prime rib. OH YEAH! well thats what i thought. Horse radish was old, lost its pizzazz and kick. They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone.. and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot.. booo). Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can't get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money. The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob, and a skimpy helping of green beans.  And just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me.. Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse.. I've had SOO much better before. It was lacking in all areas of its life.  Want to know where you can go and get better food, same ambiance, and decent service (but no view of phx)...Texas Roadhouse...yeah i said it..i am bringing a chain into the discussion.. I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of here.  End of the line 1 star because the food was blech! 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good service...yup two stars...(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one..

We were unfortunately sat under the air vent so it was rather chili. We asked to move and they were more then happy to let us. Great..better seat...No freezing. So we waited and waited...finally our waitress comes. Very friendly! We order.  Tatar skins are AMAZING! Get them. They are worth it!  Got saled...very limp...like it had been sitting for a little to long...not great...but we ate it. Well picked at it..  Bread...ok...that Indian Fry Bread...good stuff...the other one...good too!  Steaks...both ordered med-well. Moms was more medium. A little to pink. Ok whatever it was eatable. Mine was well...sent it back cuz it just wasn't good. If I wanted an overdone steak I would make it at home. 2nd one was still A little to done but it was good and I moved forward with my dinner. Mom said the corn was very tasty and beans were to spicy. I had mashed potatoes...seemed a bit dry. Only ate about 1/2 of them. Carrots were very good! Cotton Candy was a nice treat!  Overall we left full with tons of leftovers.  The view...stunning! The staff...Very Friendly. The music...a nice change. The decor...very fun!  I wish some of the food was a little freasher for those prices. I also wish they had more info about the history. I had to dig it up online. And it wasn't much.  It's a fun place. I can't wait to drag the whole family there! My kids are going to love trying the slide!  I have high hopes that my next review will be worth more stars!",

Our server, Brian, looked as though he would rather be dead than working there, and I frankly don't blame him. We never got rolls when we first sat down, which isn't a big deal, but we were watching other tables in the section eating them, so....? I ordered my steak medium-well (I know, I'm a monster) and it came to me rare. I mean, RARE. I had to wait about 10 minutes for the server to come back around only to get back a hockey-puck of a steak. The baked beans are disgusting, the green beans were terrifyingly overcooked and the carrots were.... well, it was all just gross.  It's an overrated hillbilly Disneyland type of themed restaurant and I won't be making this mistake a third time. Shame on me.",

I called and asked the young lady on the phone if anything was going on for the Mother's Day, and that I preferred an 11 am. She replied that the restaurant didn't even open until 4pm and 4pm was the earliest we could come in EVEN ON AN THIS SPECIAL DAY. Hmmmm okay fine, since my Mother loves the view , I told the hostess , alright if that is the earliest you guys open for MOTHER'S day put me down for 4pm right when you guys open.  My family and I sat at home, anxious for a yummy dinner! Waiting for 4 pm!  Now the four of us show up, I approach the hostess, without receiving eye contact I inform her we have a reservation, she says (while looking down) \"name?\" I reply with my name and she looks up and says \" Alright, move to railing and a host will come grab you\" No smile. No greeting. Not even in a nice tone! I think to myself, it is fine, I am not going to acknowledge this, I am here for  my Mom and I do not want to ruin the mood.  We are led to a SMALL table. Great view. TINY table. Oh and ALL booths are EMPTY.    My boyfriend is very tall, therefore he goes back to the host and asks for a booth, IN A SASSY manor replies to him that those are only for guests of 5 or more.   He comes back saying we can't move. HUH!? Our salad and bread comes out and now his legs are hanging out and the food wont even fit.  My sister gets a manager , THEN we are able to move. Unbelievable !!!!  We get our drinks, And the waiter explains he has been on the clock since 9 am...  UM WHAT!? YOU GUYS WERE OPEN?!  AFTER BEING TOLD ABOUT THE MIMOSAS AND OMELET BAR I AM PISSED! MY poor mother is bummed!  We order food, it literally comes out in about ten minutes FASTEST food I have ever gotten brought out. I assume it is not fresh. Literally in ten mins everything was out.   The bill came out to $140.00 for four. I tipped our server generously.   The Brunch was $34.95 with a buffet AND MIMOSAS.   Such a disappointment.",

The server made it a point to tell us, \"I have 50 other checks so no problem\" when he assumed my check was split, very rude to start the night. When my colleague, his wife and children didn't even get their order taken let alone there food arrived at the END of EVERYONE eating including myself after the rattlesnake they brought our was cold & the Chipotle sauce they initially forgot to bring out with the plate looks like it was sitting all day, DISGUSTING! After talking with \"Tom\" a so called manager of the restaurant, after his egotistical conversation with me I couldn't even finish telling him what happened and he went off to replace my food and still others didn't even have their dinner over 1 hour being in the restaurant. They ended up cancelling their dinner after being irritated and loss of appetite from the unprofessional & down right rude service from the server and now the manager. His excuse to me was \"I wasn't there to see it so I can't say what happened\" EXCUSE ME? So you won't take responsibility for your employees actions, not even an apology or offer to rush their food or compliment them with something? His ending conversation as the food was coming out over an hour late that we cancelled was, \" No problem, we will take the food and eat it in the back no problem\" My colleague ended up taking his family somewhere else to eat after the group finished eating. Tom, please get off your high horse, learn how to listen to your customers who have built businesses beyond your recognition and take constructive criticism because your business will fail with that attitude. I feel bad the owner doesn't know how his business is being run. Please get it together for the sake of your business.",

    "text": "My wife and I had been to this restaurant several years ago with a group of co-workers during Christmas season.  We enjoyed it.  In our quest to find some good prime rib we decided to visit again.  All the other reviewers who spoke about the view are correct and I won't repeat those comments here.  We requested and received a nice table with a view.  We were there on a Friday night at 6 pm.  Big mistake.  The place was loaded with families with kids.  I don't know if kids eat free on Friday night or whether there was a deal with the next door Arizona Grand Resort, but there were kids everywhere.  Fortunately, most of them were well behaved but there are always a few squawkers.  If you are looking for a romantic place for a nice dinner with your sweetie, this ain't it.  This is a country and western themed restaurant with a live band blaring C&W music all night.  Servers all wear cowboy hats and cowboy clothes.  Most male customers are wearing baseball caps.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that, just know what you are getting into before you go.  When our server first approached our table he said, \"I'm a little backed up so it'll be a bit before I can get to you.\"  Okay.  About 15 minutes later he came back and took our drink order.  Fifteen minutes later the beverages arrived.  Another 10-15 minutes passed before he returned to take our dinner order.  It was another 20 minutes before our entree arrived.  We ordered our prime rib medium rare, which according to their menu has red inside.  The two slabs we received looked as if they had been under a heat lamp for 15-30 minutes with brownish spots covering the meat.  Cut open, both pieces were at least medium, if not medium well.  Reluctant to spend more time in the cacophony of noise from the kids that inundated the place, we took a few bites.  The meat was totally unseasoned and needed a healthy dose of salt.  I had a huge pile of cooked sliced carrots on my plate.  They were also bland and cooked nearly to mush.  When the waiter came back we asked for to-go boxes.  He commented that it did not seem as if we had been very hungry.  I don't usually say anything because the server has no control of what comes out of the kitchen, but we showed him our meat and he agreed that neither piece was anywhere near medium rare.  He graciously thanked us for our comments and said he was going to send a manager over.  Within a minute the manager was at our table.  After explaining our situation he stated that he wanted to bring us each another piece of prime rib and he would ensure that it was medium rare.  Within 5 minutes he was back with two full plates of food.  Both pieces of meat were medium rare!  We thanked him for his assistance and he thanked us for bringing this to his attention.  We were very grateful for the way in which this situation was handled.  If it had not been for that I would have give a 2-star rating.  We were not impressed with the quality of food, emphasis seems to be on quantity, and thought the price was very high - $100 for two dinners and two drinks, including tip (which was 20% to the server who handled our concerns with grace).  So, if you are looking for a steak house to take out-of-towners whom you think will be impressed with a \"Cowboy\" atmosphere, this might be your place.  If you are celebrating a special occasion and want to impress your sweetie with your elegance, go elsewhere.  Different strokes for different folks.",

    "text": "I rarely ever write a negative yelp review, but this one needed to be done. We went on a Thursday at 5 pm thinking it would be easier because it wouldn't be as busy, boy were we wrong. First my wife attempted to ask the hostess if we could have a seat by the window, but before she could even get the words out of her mouth the hostess was already barking orders and yelling table numbers.  Next we sat for about 15 minutes without even being spoken to by anyone. When I finally caught a waitress's eye she told me our server would be there shortly. It was at least another 5 minutes before our server arrived and she in no way acknowledged that we had been waiting for so long. She took our drink as started to leave and we let her know that we were ready (as I said it had been a while) and she got visibly irritated that we wanted to go ahead and order. For the entire night we seemed to be an irritation. When our food finally got there it was depressingly bad. We both ordered our steaks medium rear and they were brown all the way through. When we sent them back the manager came out with the replacements and asked us to go ahead and cut into them. Mine was obviously medium well and he says \"Yeah, that looks better.\" I told him it was close enough and choked it down. No seasoning, no flavor, not worth the price.  They've obviously decided to become a one stop tourist trap and are ok with poor quality and terrible service knowing that you're probably not coming back anyway.",

I wouldn't go back here, but it was fun to try once.  Saving Money Protip: I'm not sure if they let you split a meal, but if so, order a meal and add a baked potato (only like $2 more).

I had not been to RR for quite some time, but decided that it would be a great place to take my dad for his Bday and mom for Mothers day, two birds with one stone so to say. Had reservations for 6:30PM, didn't get seated until after 7:00. We all ordered the filet and each one came out cooked incorrectly. After notifying the waiter he says he will get us all new steaks. In about 20 minutes, the steaks arrived and were the same original steaks and nothing had been changed on them. At this point I asked for the manager, he comes, grabs the steaks and says \"6 minutes I'll have all new steaks\". While waiting, the sweet potato fries we ordered finally arrived and 25 minutes later still no steaks, I catch the waiter and ask for the check... the manager never did come back to the table. It appears that a restaurant that used to serve pretty decent food is now depending on its view and name recognition rather than food quality and/or good customer service. On a side note, when I made reservations I told them it was my dad's Bday and they said they do something special for birthdays, which I was excited about... I guess the something special is no mention of a Bday and bad food/service. Additionally, the manager never did offer an apology (but the waiter was very apologetic). I will never return to Rustlers Roost and have made sure to pass on to all of my friends, coworkers and employees about the pitiful service/food from Rustlers Roost.",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review. Ever. But having read other recent posts and especially from the same night we were there, 05/05/18, I feel compelled to agree, not worth the time or money except for the lengthy and lively conversations it provided us for the next 3 days talking about how bad the service was. 6:30 reservations, got there on time, still had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes or so. The add'l bar tab while waiting for the table, must have been a plus for the restaurant's profit margin? Got seated finally, the lighting was so dark that most guests were using cell phone flashlights to read the menu. Kind of comical really that management didn't even seem to notice because the lights remained that dark. The waiter whisked salad plates out like he was dealing a deck of cards reaching across the table for the last few. The premixed salad was floppy and mostly went uneaten. The fry bread was good at least. Drink refills were not offered, had to ask. Requested a wine menu, the waiter said, \"oh that's those cards behind you if you want to grab one\". I think our order did not get entered sequentially because two tables around us were seated, ate, and checked out before we even got our steaks, at 8:10 pm. The view was nice of course, and at least my 11 year old had entertainment in playing on the slide while we waited and waited for our meals to be served. By the time our dinner arrived, two of us did not even touch our food, not hungry any more I guess. I tried contacting management as well, but oddly, the CONTACT US button on the restaurant's website goes to an \"error\" page. I think they really don't want to know what their customers think.",

They ruined our close friend's surprise birthday party with their 'call ahead, and when you get here you'll only wait 25 - 30 minutes for a table, rather than an hour like the folks who have walked in' policy. The worst part of this experience, is that we called ahead to verify we would be seated by 7PM so we could surprise our good friend on his birthday. No one stated that there would be a wait to get seated, being fully aware of the situation, and that this is a surprise birthday dinner. They dropped the ball with communicating this. We spoke to the manager, who provided useless solutions like \"we'll get you a table as soon as possible... yeah... sorry. Terrible service. Please don't bother with eating here. It's way over priced, the management is terrible, and not worth the crappy atmosphere, and experience. You've been warned.",

    "text": "This is a place that I would NOT recommend to anyone. Upon arrival we waited for 5 minutes just for the hostess to acknowledge our presence. She took us to a table against the rear wall when most of the tables by the window were open. She left us standing there while she returned to the hostess podium. We were finally seated at a window table. We waited 10 minutes for someone to take our order for drinks and our entrees. Five minutes later our server bring out a bowl of salad and some bread. The bread had a burnt taste to it and it was not able to be covered up by the butter. We served ourselves salad and tried to decide if there was any dressing on it or not. If there was any dressing it was so little than it definitely didn't touch every piece of lettuce and it was very bland...basically tasteless .My guest had ordered a filet mignon done medium rare. When he received it, the meat was so tough that he could barely stick his fork in it. Another 10 minutes trying to find a server...finally got a server and explained the problem...ok several minutes later he brings another piece of meat that isn't much better than the first but he manages to eat it. I ordered the prime rib medium rare but by the time I received it...ice cold! The vegetables that were served were overcooked and pretty tasteless.  The one redeeming quality of this place is the view but good dinner should be a part of it. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone",

I will give tell you of my experience as I have no dog in this fight one way or the other. I only tell it like it is.  \"The Facts and Only the Facts.\" The names won't be change to protect the innocent or the guilty. This past weekend  my wife and I were in town for my daughter's graduation and wanted to enjoy a celebration dinner. We had reservations at Ditka's That review will have to wait for another day. But moving on. my daughter recommended Rustler Rooste. Saying it was a bit more kid  friendly. She was right on the mark. Very down home country. Not stuffy and or  upscale. Family oriented from the Long Horned Bull outside, to the entry way access, the slide/staircase, to the country band and huge dining area. Service on our visit was prompt, accommodating, and very attentive. As we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we had this guy hopping and slinging bread and drinks that never seemed to run low. Finally we ordered. Food came out quick,  Hot and correct. A rare occurrence normally with a large group and large order. But it was right. Everyone enjoyed their meal, conversation and drinks. The place is noisy lots of movement, bands, a wedding party, kids on the slide. Cotton Candy flowing out of tin cans. Just a good light hearted night out with the family.  Serving sizes were good, price was moderate. Menu had something for everyone. Family style servings too if that's your thing. I really enjoyed it.  The Prime Rib was on point I might add. The last item if you're going for dinner. Sunset is the time to go. The view was amazing. Definitely would come back again. But Ditkas is still on my to do list.",

We had a large group of 16 people and we were all served our food quickly and refills came even quicker.  The portions were perfect, you definitely don't leave still hungry. The drinks were poured with a heavy hand and tasted delicious.  The entertaining saloon atmosphere was perfect, especially the indoor slide for the kids to play on while the parents danced the two-step if they felt the urge.  The fun cotton candy deserts impressed both the kids and adults alike.  The outside has a beautiful hilltop view that you could see from the inside dining area even if you're sitting in the back and the sunset is gorgeous.  It was definitely a exciting place to go and if I'm ever in the area again it will be a must to go again.",

    "text": "This place was great - many years ago.  Sadly, it's a shadow of its former self. Sure, the place still has terrific views but that's it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren't cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.    My wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it's made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.    Then came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be \"Overcooked and Flavorless\" because the trend started with our son's unfortunate kid's meal was consistent across the entire meal.    My son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn't even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We'll wait, thanks.    Getting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, \"I already told her I'd replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?\"   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.  So sorry to be an interruption to your evening of overcooking and underseasoning everything.    We won't be back again.  Ever.",

Neither were finished.  I should have known it was going to be bad when the waitress asked if I wanted A-1 sauce.    My steak was less than 1/3 inch thick and severely overcooked.  I would have returned it but didn't see the waitress again.  It had absolutely zero seasoning and tasted like cardboard.  I really was wishing I had asked for that A-1 Sauce (which I hate)   I have had better steaks at the Waffle House.  If you want  a steak, go elsewhere.  A Big Mac would have been a step up from the meal I got at Rustlers Roost.  The restaurant has a nice view but the food is EXTREMELY sub standard.  I will NEVER EVER, EVER dine there again.",

    "text": "First off I would like to say that our experience was like night and day compared to the last time we were here. It's funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has. Let me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother's Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, \"This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here\". Well I'm not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here. We ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit.  I do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I've been a GM for some time, and I don't believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses'. Rustler's Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.  Tom, First off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler's Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience.  I pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn't take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate.  The overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time.  I appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler's Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn.  Thanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don't think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler's Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee's in the late '80s. It used to be some place special to take out of town visitors, kind of a land mark if you will. I just think that time and expectations have changed.",

I made reservation on Thursday for Saturday night and 630pm and 8pm were available times, I took the 8pm, but then called back 5 minutes later to change to the 630pm time slot, gal on phone said no problem. My husband, son and I arrived just before 630pm and our name was not on the list. Hostess said it must not have came up from downstairs yet. We were given a buzzer to wait until a table was ready. Once the buzzer went off and they walked us to our table, which was a booth I said my reservation specified a table, not booth, which when we were not on the list 20 minutes ago stupid me should have men-tioned that AGAIN. So we were given another buzzer and 30 minutes to wait. At this point, offering a drink or dessert would have been thoughtful. Plus the fact that we had flowers and pre-sents should have been a clue that this was a special occasion.  Buzzer went off again and we were walked towards some tables which were all filled and then returned back to the waiting area for another 2-5 minutes then finally taken to a table on the other side.  We order appetizers, which were pleasing. The sodas come in small jars, I mean two good sips small, tell server to leave a pitcher, especially if you are thirsty! Once our food came out a runner sat it down on tray table and we waited a few minutes until server came over and delivered to us.  For birthdays, they offer an eclair with ice cream. Kind of odd, I would have thought a brownie or cake, maybe cobbler?  Atmosphere and view are great, but last few visits, the food quality seems to be lacking",

The food is typical but not at a level that I would consider a normal steakhouse to be at. The meat was cooked close to correctly but lacked any real flavor. The sides seem as though they are an afterthought and lack any real imagination or flavor as well.   Overall, I would say that this is fun place to take your kids or a friend who likes country to. It is not a restaurant that I would take anyone who is looking for an affordable and delicious meal.",

    "text": "There was an episode of Full House once where the Tanner family dined at a pirate-themed family restaurant that was completely decked out in pirate decor from the waitress' garb to a plank that misbehaved kids could dive off of into a sea of balls. Rustler's Rooste is the western version of this place. A cowboy's dream; a steakhouse for dates and family parties. When you drive up the hill to get to this place, you immediately get the feeling that you're in for a treat. As you walk towards the entrance...and get a whiff of the huge cow hanging out in front, you know this will be quite an adventure. You walk into a cavernous corridor decorated with plastic rock....sort of like the walls inside the Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland. Make reservations, as this is a popular place, or wait at the bar until your beeper lights up.   On the way to your table, depending on where you sit, you can even choose to take the giant SLIDE down to the first floor. If you're lucky, a live band will be playing country rock jams on the elevated stage right next to the slide and you can high-five the bass player on your way down...this is truly a cheesy place...but at least the food delivers.   Steaks and bbq are plentiful here, but I cannot recommend their prime rib or their ribeye any higher. Marbled meat that is tender, juicy, and indulgent. Good sides (I opt for the mashed potatoes and each meal comes with a tossed salad, bread, and cowboy beans. Wait staff are incredibly friendly and the view out the window is beautiful-- desert sprawl and Arizona mountains at their finest. Now this is no CUT or BOA Steakhhouse or anything so keep your fancy expectations aside. This is just a darn good place to get your fill of meat, beer, and fun while throwing peanut shells on the ground.",

Super disappointed and I will not be returning anytime soon. This place needs to focus less on the decor and atmosphere and more on the food.",

First I called in the morning to see if they took reservations.  They said no, but I could do call ahead seating.  I said I'd call back after I confirmed a time with my friends.  We figured out a time and I called back only to be told they were not doing call ahead seating tonight. Ok, so we go anyway because you'd have a wait most anywhere.  We get there and the hostess asks if I did call ahead seating.  I tell her I tried but was told they weren't doing it tonight, so we get on a 40 minute wait.  60 minutes later they finally seat us.  We got menus and water right away.  30 minutes later they still haven't taken our order!  We flag someone down and get told they seated us in a closed section.... We order, get out food, which was so,so.  One order under cooked, carrots and corn over cooked.  No discount offered for the hassle.  I'll skip the tourist trap and take friends to a better place next time.",

The bull totally fits the idea - setting the scene for the old west and showing you what you're about to be eating, but the smell is far from appetizing, particularly after the \"rain.\"  I was taken off guard when the soft-spoken server mentioned the slide, and wasn't really in the mood to try it myself, but I did see some others give it a go later.  We were promptly seated by the window, where we could get a good view of the guys who were lassoing the wooden calf out front.  It was charming to be served beer in Mason jars, even though the selection of draft beers could have been larger.  The fry bread we had while waiting for the rest of our party was good, though the chewiness indicated that it wasn't that fresh, but the cinnamon butter made up for it.  I opted for the Vaquero,a smaller steak served with cheese enchiladas.  The steak was decent, but the tortillas of the cheese enchiladas were quite chewy.  I think I should have opted for the filet, which my dining companions all got, and it came with green beans and corn.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I had kids and was passing through town.  Otherwise, I'll be looking for somewhere with more focus on the food than the theme.",

    "text": "For my boyfriend's 27th birthday I wanted to take him to a nice steakhouse. He suggested Rustler's Rooste as a nostalgic visit. As a kid, he remembers frequenting the restaurant to celebrate anniversaries, weddings and good company. I was very excited to take him to the restaurant for that purpose and it would be my first visit there. It will also be my last. When I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws. When I picked up the cup, I looked inside to find it was coated with what appeared to be paint chippings and dirt. It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet.  Our food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible.  I never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless. I think that reflects more on the restaurant than his skill sets.  When we left it was a relief. The only reason I will go back is if I am asked to participate on Restaurant Rescue, or to save my unborn child's life.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were in Phoenix and #1 daughter took us to Rustler's Rooste for Sunday night dinner.  I was not favorably impressed.  The drive to the restaurant after dark is confusing and we got turned around more than once trying to get to the parking lot.  The upper lot with the handicapped spaces is much too cramped, especially when the trolley/bus is there.  A negative.  Having the bull in a pen just outside the front entrance door was a turn-off for me.  Smelling bull s---- before I walked in the door did nothing to whet my appetite.  A real negative.  The stairs are somewhat steep and I felt very vulnerable going down the stairs (no slide for this old lady).  A negative.  We were lucky enough to be seated at a table over looking the city.  The view is spectacular.  That was a positive.  We waited for our server to arrive to take our orders.  We waited for our beverages to arrive.  We waited.  When our entrees were finally delivered to our table, they were put on a tray and left to sit for about 5 minutes before yet another server came to serve us.  It was pretty obvious that the plates had been allowed to sit for more than a minute under the lights in the kitchen, and adding the 5 minutes on the tray made for a steak that was only lukewarm.  A negative.  My filet was tough and had a lot of gristle in it.   A negative. The beans were good, but I can't say I was impressed by the meal.  I took the largest part of my steak home for the next day, and when I got it into good light to slice for a sandwich, I found a thick streak of gristle through the middle, which pretty-much negated the idea of making a decent sandwich.    We had trouble finding someone to refill beverages, and we didn't see the same server at our table but twice--when she took our order and when she brought our check.  It was somewhat confusing to have to repeat our drink orders every time someone came to the table.  A negative.  My feeling is that a restaurant of this calibre, at the prices they charge, shouldn't have to entertain its patrons with someone who is making balloon animals.  The almost-constant popping of balloons, along with the ambient noise, was a real negative for me.  I've had a better meal at Texas Roadhouse!",

I let the bartender: 'Fire' know it was my birthday weekend and my family was anxious about getting a 'good' table and he was kind enough to take pity on us and put our name on the reservations list even though it was a little late for that. A+!   The slide...its cool! Not sure why parents let their kids play on it like we're at chucky cheese but whatevs....did I mention the margaritas?? :)   Dinner was delish and served family style. Youre basically picking a meat. Band started and that was neat...a real experience for my out of towners. Servers were friendly and they sang and gave me a cowboy hat and a giant eclair for my B'Day. I love cheese! We will definitely be back. We felt welcome and the view was enthralling.",

Upon arrival we used the valet because there seemed to be no parking (a tip for anyone heading out on a Saturday to the Rooste)  When you first go into the restaurant there is a big bull in a fence, it was interesting but it added onto the theme and it was just pretty cool The entrance itself is pretty cool, feels like youre walking in an old mine... Second tip, I happened to call ahead to put my name in, which is pretty much a reservation.  We were seated and I took in all of the surroundings, the inside was really cool and then I saw a slide... I loved the mason jars everywhere That stood out to me the most and I was really puzzled as to why it was there but the only thing I kept thinking was how original and fun that the slide added... We sat close to it so I got to see pretty much everyone go down, there was a lot of children who went and very many adults even slid down So you know I had to do it too, if the older people were  :D As we sat down the server brought us muffins and little frybread  Im Navajo so I dug into the frybread, it was thick and doughy but I didnt mind that at all, I thought it was cool that they offered it, kudos. She also brought us salad as an appetizer which I thought was pretty yummy I ordered the fried chicken which came with green beans and corn on the cob We also got to split some cowboy beans which was beans mixed with hot dogs I liked it My food was actually really good so I would recommend this dish Another cool thing was that after our meal we got free cotton candy which was super cool  All in all if you would like a new, different place then I would suggest Rustlers Rooste OMG I forgot to mention that there was live music, a nice band of country singers That was my ultimate favorite part, I am a sucker for live music After reading my entire review, I shouldve just started it off with the live music The bar looked pretty cool too  Go here, enjoy it",

Service was okay.  The location and ambience of the place was very nice; located on top of hill with a heck of a view of the valley and the interior had a very authentic western feel.  A magician came out to entertain us at our table.  I will not go back unless someone else is paying.",

I love starting off with their freshly made biscuits and fry bread and applying the most amazing cinnamon butter on them!! Their house salad is by far my favorite house salad since their home made ranch is delicious, which typically I do not enjoy ranch but here I could drink it! I also recommend their onion rings that are amazing, yet another item I don't typically enjoy at most places!! Their steaks are amazing! My favorite is their tenderfoot filet! For dessert I would recommend their Cowper which is my favorite or their chocolate cake! The view here is incredible! Especially for the sunset! They have a live band which sounds amazing! They have stairs but I recommend taking the slide ;). When you first walk up to the restaurant you are greeted by a real life steer!! The atmosphere is very lively and family friendly! Hey also have a magician and balloon maker that will come around the tables! Overall I highly recommend eating here!!",

I decided to wonder in, after a day basquing in the sun all day at the resorts waterpark.  the View is amazing, the smell of the damn cattle in front of the door, unpleasent.  But once you pass that, walk in thru a mine like entrance , almost upwards a tight shaft, then you are greeted my sweet gals that offer you to either walk down the stairs to your table, or slide down the slide.  I chose to slide down the slide, in short shorts..oooopssssies camel toe.  ;)  Old wood floors covered in sawdust and men in cowboy hats.  There is a live band playing while kids are dancing around having a blast.   The theme is working....  We have a great seat over looking central phoenix.  AMAZING!!!!!   Geoff and I decided to order the HUGE SAMPLER which almost bascially has everything on the menu.  21.00 a person.  Great choice and damn I was full!!!!!!

They have a smelly bull outside that looks cute and pointy. The entrance has quite an incline when you get inside. There is an option to go down the slide but it is mobbed by kids going down it and then climbing right back up the stairs. You will have to stake your claim because that line is fierce! :)   The prime rib was good and the Melon Margarita was better then good. The Beef Nachos were AWESOME. I would get that for my meal and not miss a thing. The band that was playing was a great older country band that had people dancing. It was a relaxing country, not the put on stuff. Not that I'm a country fan but there is a difference from the country on crack(pop?) music and the older style.   They have a very talented balloon guy that makes great swords, motorcycles, hats... etc.. for kids, for free.  LOUD. VERY loud.  Lots of people, lots of kids!  Good place to take a group, call ahead.  Cotton candy is served at the end whether you order it or not. It is free and I even tried some even though I swore I wouldn't.   TLDR: Novelty spot.  LOUD. Worth the visit to try once to see if it is your thing.  MUST try the Shredded beef Nachos. I'm a fan of the Melon Margarita. The entrance has a steep incline when you go inside.",

They have live band, a good bar @ the second floor with a great view of the city. When you enter the place , you might get overwhelmed with stuff. Like there's a cow in front, a slide for kids, the band might be playing or people dancing to the songs. It simple has that \"let's do party\" atmosphere!  Now with the food. For the times I ate here, I can tell that the best food that they offer is the beans. Other their beans they don't offer anything that can make you remember the place forever. Big portions but unfortunately the flavors are are not that delicious:(  For the price that your paying I think its more of the atmosphere than the food that you're actually paying. But its still something that everyone has to experience!  At least try it once I am pretty sure you're gonna love the experience.",

I would like to introduce you to a couple of modern inventions:  Salt & Pepper.    The salad was sauced perfectly with ranch dressing. Not overpowering.  The live band was awesome.

I wouldn't normally write a bad review but I have a feeling that management knows the food is bad (how can't they?) but just don't care. They're making money regardless. I believe most place that have substandard food, try but just can't pull it off. Rustler's is probably pulling in the cash and just couldn't give a crap which is what their food tastes like.",

    "text": "A little background information: we went on Sunday 4/17/16 @ approximately 4:30-5pm. The place wasn't that busy, so we thought for sure we'd get excellent service and great food in stellar time.   We sat down and the waiter seemed uninterested in taking our order and being at work all together. We didn't order anything extravagant or needy, just standard menu items (nothing customized at all), the waiter cut us off as we were ordering, and acted put-off in general. The waiter then brought us our drinks, a basket of biscuits&frybread and slapped them down without saying a word and walked away.   When our food arrived 45 minutes later, the steaks were way over cooked (example I ordered mine to be \"medium\" and it was definitely closer to well done), and NOBODY's food was hot (and NOTHING tasted good enough to justify the price I paid). The food was on the lukewarm side, but on the cool end of that spectrum. If the service couldn't get any more subpar (at least from our waiter), we had to get out of the booth to track down different servers to ask for things like butter (simple things). To top it off, the only time the waiter ever even offered to top our drinks off was when we asked for the check.   Needless to say, I'll never be back. I will however share my experience with my friends, coworkers, and anyone else who mentions this place. It was pretty disappointing to say the least. I hope the manager or owner will read this review and make some changes. This place definitely had the potential to be a neat experience... It fell way way short. You'll get a better meal & service at just about anywhere else.i",

But surely no one comes here for the food, let alone the steaks.  I ordered the \"USDA Prime\" 10oz. sirloin and had a hard time believing it was anything better than Choice.  There was no flavor to this steak. There was plenty of food, so no one went home hungry, but this place is nothing to write home about - thus, this entry! ;)  Oh, and despite the novelty, don't bother with the rattlesnake appetizer. It has to be one of the worst things on the menu.  No, it doesn't taste like chicken.  I'd rather eat alligator any day!

Took forever, our table was almost done eating. STILL NO FLAVOR! .......REALLY!!  This is a steak house for Pete sake. Spend some money on a salt and pepper shaker. Sister and spouse tried it too and agreed. Manager said they season with salt and pepper and are usually heavy on that, then followed up with \"a filet usually has little flavor\". Huh?? Asked him to try it but he refused. But just continued to argue the point but would not try it. He Just liked to continue to say I was wrong. So I was done! Sooooo done! And manager did nothing to make it right I mean NOTHING! But he got out of there quick. Maybe he was not the manager!  Just presented us with the rest of the expensive bill. So after we left our party. We went back to our hotel the Wild Horse Pass Resort so I could eat something. I was so starving since I had only bread and my husband sat and watched. REAL FUN NIGHT!!! So maybe the General Manager should call us if they care.",

We dine at Rustlers Rooste on a monthly basis; but unfortunately, today will be our last. Dan Garcia (restaurant manager) ruined our daughters birthday by yelling at her with his finger in her face to get off the slide because she was sitting on a sweatshirt while going down. After my daughter explained the her father said it was ok he then said \" does your father own this restaurant, is your father the manager, I didn't think so\". After having words with him he proceeded to be a complete ass and ruined the night for the entire group. We all got to go boxes and took our dinners to home to enjoy.  Dan Garcia should not be in a position that he deals with the public.",

We came here because a friend of ours wanted to try the rattle snake which was over breaded, the pieces were very tiny and it came with breaded cactus which we couldn't tell between the rattle snake or cactus sometimes since the lighting was dim and it tasted over cook.  Overall the ambience is nice but I don't think we will return for the food.",

    "text": "I have lived in the valley for 23 years and this was my first time at Rustler's Roost.  I have heard about many times over the years as it is somewhat of a tourist landmark restaurant but never had the opportunity to try it.  The perfect opportunity arose last night when we had family in town and decided to give it a try.  This restaurant is situated at the top of a hill at the Arizona Grand Hotel.  The views are incredible and the feel and theme are really fun especially since we are right of the I-10.  It feels like you are in a small cowboy area in the middle of the city.  This is a family friendly place that is actually really good for kids as it is loud and your little ones won't be bothering anyone.  There is music 7 nights a week and it can be very crowded, despite the fact that the restaurant seats at least 500 not including the patio.  We were able to get a reservation as we were a larger group of 10 so that was nice.  The restaurant is very dim and we needed our smartphone flashlights in order to read them.  Thank goodness for technology.  The menu is what you would expect from a theme steak house.  The usual fare; steaks, chicken and some seafood with the typical side dishes.  I decided on the mixed grill which was very tender filet medallions and you had a choice of another meat and I chose the ribs.  They were also very good and tender.  The side veggie were carrots that were tasty but some were not cooked enough so they were tough.  We also all got cowboy beans (eh) and salad for the table as well as rolls that were kind of yucky.  For dessert, we opted to try the cowpie (how could you not?) which was basically chocolate covered coffee ice cream.  The description definitely sounded better than it tasted but it was ok to satisfy our sweet tooths.  The meals that my family had they enjoyed as well.    This is definitely a place that I would come back to.  I would say it is a place to enjoy with friends or out of town guests if you are looking for something different.",

You are not allowed to sit at a booth unless you have five or more people in your group. Instead you are placed at a tiny table that is quickly overloaded leaving no elbow room whatsoever. They are extremely inflexible with your food choice not allowing for substitutions. Instead you are adding to your already crowded table with side baked potatoes or fries while a heaping plate of rice sits on your plate. Ridiculous waste of food. It's too bad. Lots of potential here but they rake it in so there's no incentive to improve. Unfortunate.",

    "text": "Ok. So. There are lots of poor reviews and a few outstanding reviews. I've been Elite for a couple years. Been to a few 5* restaurants and a few minus* restaurants. I frankly rate this place a 3*.  When you consider the history of the place (on their literature) it used to be a den of robbers, literally. The place is there for the fun & novelty factor. Def not for its culinary delights.   The parking lot is large. The place seats almost 500. They have a live steer right next to the outside front door and he does what bovines do. But hes a novelty and lets face it people, most people have never seen a real, live cow/steer. I'm sure he doesnt have the most exciting life and I'm sure if the Arizona humane society thought it was inhumane they would make the place rehome \"Horney\". Yes, thats his name!   When you walk in you'll be greeted by loud, live country music and some nice Hostesses. The place looks all 2x4 exposed wood beams and beer signs. The stories you've read about are True. There is a metal slide that you can ride down instead of taking the stairs to the lower level main dining area. Ride at your own risk especially if you're wearing shorts! Its a fast short ride with a carpeted landing. The Hostess waited patiently while my whole crew went down. I thought better of it and took the stairs.   We were shown to our table down next to the windows. The area has a delightful view of the city and was a nice backdrop. Btw, we made reservations and were seated promptly. There seemed to be a large adult birthday party going on and the \"Happy Birthday to You\" was sung with gusto and a loud dinner triangle.   The kids menus are standard and written on the back of a cute set of horns that you can put on your kids head. Mac & cheese, chicken fingers, etc for $5-8 dollars. Our Waiter Josh gave us good service. He explained the specials and was attentive to our requests. I ordered the Prime Rib Special $24 which was about a 8-10oz cut with a half corn, long grain rice and 3 shrimp. There was au juice and horseradish on the side. Josh also brought out bread with butter & cinnamon butter, a large bowl of mixed green salad and a small pot of Busch's baked beans. My friends ordered the beef ribs. So here's my critique. We didnt go to Morton's or Ruth Cris Steakhouse.  We went to the Rustlers Rooste. Lets consider & keep that in mind people. The buns were decent but the butters were tasty. The salad did indeed have a generous helping of ranch dressing applied but I would not say it was doused and limp. The iceberg  lettuce was crunchy and there were a decent amount of cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices & croutons on it.  We received our meals fairly quickly even with how full the place appeared. My Prime Rib was very rare and barely hot. The corn looked like standard costco boiled and my long grain rice was chewy. The horseradish was very full bodied and the au juice tasted like an oxo cube dissolved in warm water. The beef ribs looked decent. There seemed to be an ample amount of meat on each rib. It came with the half corn cob and boiled carrots. The carrots tasted bland and kinda chewy. My friends reported the ribs tasted decent. Afterwards they were given a nice warm washcloth with lemon squeezed overtop to wash their BBQ sauce fingers. Nice touch. Better than a dry shredded napkin. The kids ordered mac & cheese which came with garlic bread and the chicken strips which came with french fries. The portions were surprisingly large and we took home a large doggy bag. There was nothing special about the kids meals at all. But thats not necessarily bad.   At the end of the meal Josh came back with a cotton candy in a coffee tin can for the table to share. We politely declined cuz of the hour of night. Also, we chose not to order their deserts either. So I cant speak to that. I didnt use the restroom so I cant speak to that. Sorry about that.   They have a little Rustlers Rooste gift shop downstairs tucked away by the restrooms and they had t-shirts with Horney the Steer and another with a reference to eating their rattlesnake entree. They had kids small figurine horsies, shooter glasses shaped like a boot, hats and you could buy the button-up American flag shirts that the wait staff were wearing. I purchased a t-shirt and it was about $17.   So, all in all, our experience was pleasant, Josh gave us good service, the food was not overly impressive but we figured \"what the heck, we'll go there for the fun\".  That, friends, is how you need to broach this place. Simply for its entertainment value. Period.",

CONS: -Staff, not very attentive, I understand we had a large group, but you also had notice of our reservation... staff up. -Food, nothing special. It was by no means bad, but for these prices I've had way better. The free biscuits and cinnamon butter were the best thing I ate all night. -Lack of vegetables or other alternatives on the menu, although I am a proud and happy meat eater, this would NOT be the place for your vegetarian friends, or friends that prefer to have some greens. -Waitressing staff at the end of the night went back and forth for what seemed like an hour, on whether or not they could split the check. Either way, we just wanted to go home. She finally split is by table and comes up and tells us, \"so these aren't 100% accurate but this is what it's supposed to cost.\" I kid you not. She charged us for what she \"thought\" the bill was supposed to be rather than what we actually ordered. Major fail.   Clearly the cons outweigh the pros. If you're going here for the food, don't. If you're going here because you want an awesome view and atmosphere and you don't mind the mediocre food and service, just know what's in store for you and your party. From the other reviews on here it doesn't look much different if you're a party of 2 or a group of 30+.",

This is definitely the go to place to take visitors and has been for a long time.  Being a near native, I practically grew up here and it is still a wonderful experience.  The food is just okay in my opinion but the ambience and view more than make up for it.    On our last visit, we started with the potato skins.  They make the best I've ever had.  Perfection.  I had the big burger and it was just that - big.  I made it through half of it before calling it quits.  Very cute that they give complimentary cotton candy at the the end of the meal and the kids loved getting balloon butterflies.   Loved that we could go outside, relax and visit with family at the end of the night.  Our visitors always end up leaving with one of the $35 rattlesnake head keychains.  Pretty unique from where they're from.",

Don't forget to take the slide instead of the stairs, it is well worth it and makes the night start of right. You can't help but enjoy your food after you go down a 15 foot slide on the way to your table. The hamburger is amazing and my bro had the fried chicken, which he enjoyed. The view is killer and it is worth the trip if you like honkey-tonk and ranch style scenery. If you are into Texas, love America, and love country style settings, this is the place for you. Enjoy!",

The positives: -a big bull outside the bar/restaurant -a SLIDE from the main level down to the lower level! -live music  -decent drinks for a fair price  The negatives: -the bull smells  -the little kids hog the slide -the music is country  -nobody was there  I imagine this place would be tons more fun if you know how to line dance and there was a good crowd.

The kiddies like it so its worth the smells.  Checking in with the hostess has always been an issue and it was no different this time around.  It was about a 30 minute wait for a table and a bit unorganized to get your name in with the waitress.    If you can get a table along the windows, you will get a fantastic view of the valley, sunset and the air traffic into Sky Harbor.  Worth the trip just for the views.  Once you get buzzed that your table is ready,  you get to walk down steps or take the slide to the dining level.  The slide is a zoo with lots of kids...and some adults who act like kids...so that is part of the fun.    Live country music and a smallish dance floor and sawdust, a classic touch.  This is not your new country music. You will get your Johnny, Willie and Waylan which is the way I like it.  Decent menu with options for the kids.  I ordered the 16 oz. Prime Rib (Marshall), medium rare.  The meal comes with bread/butter before hand.  Family style salad and cowboy beans as the first course.  And corn on the cob & green beans with the entree.  The prime rib was every bit of 16 oz, but it was over cooked.  More toward medium than MR.  That was disappointing, especially since 1/4 of the front page of the menu was taken up describing how they cook their meat.  The sides were OK.  I think they are making a mistake by serving the meal on a plate with a metal cover.  Condensation builds up on the inside of the lid and drips onto to the entree.  It just make everything soggy.  The service was good, although I had so many plates at my smallish table, that i ran out of room to put things.  For a table of four, (two of which were kids under 3) I had 9 small plates.  We had a stack of them left on the end of the table for about 10 minutes before someone stopped by to pick them up.  Just a weird experience.  There is also at least two people walking around making balloon animals, for a small fee.  These guys/gals are fun and kids certainly got a kick out of it.    Lastly, we were offered cotton candy as we left.   Definitely something my 3yr didn't need, but it was a nice touch.     Overall, the food was a 2, but the experience was a 4 especially for the kids....so they get a 3 from me.",

    "text": "Thanksgiving dinner DISAPPOINTMENT! WORST SERVICE!  Every year my family cooks but this year we decided to eat out and try out this restaurant. The thanksgiving dinner special  is $139 feast for 6 to 8 people, a little pricey but we thought hey it must good portions.  We were only 6 adults and a kid. Before getting into details of the experience.  I would like to say I have been in hospitality and have been in restaurant business for 10+ years for major hotels. So our experience begins with a  \"reservation\" for 7 people at 4 pm. We get there and there is a line out the door. No separate lines for  reservations and for walk ins. They said sorry its not a reservation but priority seating only. We will have to wait for 30 min +. It ended up being an hour!  No really apologies and the hostess were completely disorganized and lacked good service.  There was actually one hostess that was amazing and kept her composer.  I apologize for not getting her name but she had straight hair and I believe she is African American. She deserves to be hired at a fine dinning restaurant.  If she reads this post I hope she applies to a fine dinning place. We get seated and our Server Dale is beat already.  But he was nice and we tried to be positive. He brought us the first course with no utensils.  He apologized and we understood they were busy and I bet the dishwasher was running behind. We order our drinks and a few were alcohol beverages.  He never asked if we wanted more drinks or check on us that frequently.  Again I am a part time server so I kept positive.  The food i do have to say was delicious but the portions were really small. Not sure really worth the price. When my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser. He didn't say excuse me. So rude. When my family and I wanted to split the check a certain way he rolled his eyes! We were going to give 20% or even a little more but soon dropped it. Then we asked for foil to cover our leftover pie he just threw it on the table and walked away without asking how was our dinning experience.  We informed the manager/owner Karen I believe and she seemed genuine but only said sorry and next time just ask for her and she would make sure we would have a different experience.  I live in California. I highly doubt I will ever come and if I have friends who visit Phoenix area I would never suggest this place.  I would probably warn them. I honestly think they need to hire a new restaurant manager and reevaluate their staff.",

Then as you walk up the trail to the front door your nose is assaulted with the other kind of meat: alive and pooping in a pen. Dang, that  bull had the biggest antlers I've ever seen - oh, like I know what  you call those pointy things. Upon entering you're offered a choice: stairs or slide. The 11 kids in our party uniformly opted for the slide. Over and over and over again. So did most of the moms. The 2 dads and one boyfriend all stuck with the stairs.  The family style pork ribs were great. And can I have two of those delish Margies, rocks with salt, plskthx? Nummers.  The establishment itself was gracious to the point of absurdity. We had a 5.30pm reservation for a party of 22. Due to bad traffic, getting lost, missing turns, and just general bad planning, half of us were 45 minutes late. On Valentine's Day, no less! And we were the early ones! The other half of us arrived another hour later. Half of those in our party were girls between the ages of 6 and 14 and no one batted an eye. (And yes, now you all know how pitiful my life is that I spent Valentine's Day with a giant group of kids.)  The band was excellent. The dancing was fun to watch but I'd never participate due to my 17 left feet. The only thing I'd change were the gray mealy beans.  Great place to greet then eat your meat.",

All of the staff was very nice, our server Rebecca wasnt at all. No enthusiasm, it took forever to bring the bill so i just handed her my form of payment.  She came back with the bill, no credit card, no pen...and then decided to walk past our table a few times then chat up another table.  My boyfriend had to get up and tell her that she had my card while on his way to take our 4yr old to the slide bc we knew it would be a while.  She was tired and was getting cranky.  Rebecca looked lost for a minute then walked away to process the payment and return with a pen.  The steak had no flavor but was cooked perfect, like i have seen in previous reviews.  I use to be a server and know how to tip...that was the hardest tip i had to give.",

And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!  Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.  Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the \"rustic\" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?  No. No. And no.  From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes.   They were helpful with extras (can you say \"More gravy please?\") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.  The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time.   Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful.   I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks.   Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.  Oh. The. Holidays.",

In the past the food has always been mediocre and ordinary service, again I come for the ambience. I'm a local. However we visited on December 19, 2014 and the place was packed, however I must say this was a much better experience. We started with drinks and then moved onto the rattlesnake appetizer, which was delicious. We all ordered steak.I had a fillet mignon medium which was cooked perfect. My two friends had prime rib which was cooked perfect. The sides were amazing. We had the balloon man make us an Arizona Cardinals player out of balloons to compete with another table who were Seattle Seahawks fans with their own balloons. It was a competitive environment between the two tables. They brought us free Cotton candy to end the evening. I really enjoyed this experience with my out-of-town friends and had a great time. I feel they have been reading the reviews and have upped the level of food and customer service. Keep up the good work!",

Our server forgot to order a drink, forgot a dessert, forgot cotton candy, took 15 minutes to get extra scoops of ice cream, and in general was just missing at the end of our meal. Then when the check comes, it's auto gratuity, which is calculated wrong AND calculated on the after tax total. Apparently it's done on the computer, but it's wrong. Despite all this, the manager did not seem to care. Not sure we'll come back after this experience. It's been an annual tradition, but we'll just go to Aunt Chilada's and spend less. I mentioned this to a manager who could have cared less. Such s disappointment!",

It was like a maze getting to our table with the hills and turns and stairs inside the restaurant...There was a band playing country music, which isn't normally my preference but it suits this place perfectly. And the band wasn't so loud you had to shout over them, which is also nice. I ordered the garden burger and it was decent enough. I substituted sweet potato fries which were good, but not spectacular.  The rest of the table ordered steaks, mostly filets which came with green beans.  The salad the comes with the entrees is a house salad and they have one dressing, a house-made ranch. I'd have to say they definitely save the best part for last... A big can (yes, i said can) of cotton candy!!  Will I go back??  Ehhh.... It would have to be the right circumstance.",

    "text": "Invited out of town guests to Rustler's Rooste for dinner last night. I selected the location primarily for the view and a solid menu. The website indicated that the restaurant takes reservations but when I called, I was informed that there is a \"call ahead\" list rather than an actual reservation option. The purpose of the call ahead list is to shorten your wait time.    I arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy. I was given a buzzer to notify me when our table was ready and told the wait would be 20-30 minutes. I think our wait was around the 30 minute mark.  When we were seated, we had a decent view but the restaurant was so amazingly loud, we had to practically scream at each other to be heard during the entire meal. We were competing with what felt/sounded like thousands of other diners who were all doing the same. There were a number of birthdays being celebrated while we were there and for each one the staff would come through with an insanely loud dinner triangle, accompanied by a shouted announcement and singing. It was impossible to have a conversation when this happened.  Our waiter was clearly run ragged. He did what he could to keep up with the drink refils but that's about it. Ordering was a chore because he wasn't able to hear us over the din. The food was pretty basic. I had the salmon, which was good. My  husband had the ribs, which were good and our guests each had steak. Neither of the steaks were cooked as ordered.   Along with being loud, the restaurant was very dark and our table lantern was out. We inquired about getting it lit and that took our overworked waiter almost the entire duration of the meal to manage. Once we got it lit, it was still very dark.   My husband and I had been to Rustler's Rooste once before for Easter Brunch and we were pleased with the service and food. Last night, however, was a less than enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Last night my family went to dinner here for my 40th birthday, it was one of the worst experiences ever.  We had 7 people, 3 adults and my 4 small children.  The first 5 minutes were great (the only reason for the 2nd star) as my kids loved the slide.  But just like the slide, it was all downhill from there.  A server brought us water, but he only brought 6 (because our party of 7 was placed at a 6 top), when I asked for another one so all the children had one, he said \"the little ones can share\". He never returned with another water.  Our waitress was overwhelmed, as it looked like she had 4 party's of 7 or more, and obviously did not feel like dealing with my children.  Once she rushed us through our order, not explaining that you got carrots and corn no matter what, she was gone.  Food came out very quickly so that is a plus.  But the food should have been given more attention.  The kids simply had Mac and cheese (can't mess up Kraft). But the 3 adults had steak.  I had a bone in ribeye that was over priced, but that isn't the issue.  It came out and was cooked to a fair MR, but the meat itself was super fatty and grissly, had no seasoning on it and was super tough.  My wife's prime rib was over cooked.  I ordered a \"bucket\" of sweet potato fries that came out burned.  I could not get anyone to get us more drinks so the small children were not happy, this make the waitstaff want to come over even less.  The only good thing was that 3 of the kids ate free with adult purchase, so my $120 wasn't as bad as it could have been.  I say save you money and head down to the casino, you have a better chance of a winning night.  Certainly won't forget my 40th, just for the wrong reasons.  :(",

    "text": "Stopped here for dinner while we were visiting Tempe.  The following review is based on the group meal we had in which I brought my 1yr old daughter.  -First of all, not matter what the reviews say, this restaurant is best for large groups or family gatherings.  It is quite loud and I would find it difficult to have an intimate dinner.  However, it is perfect for family and kids and should warrant a visit if you are vacationing with family/friends.    -For the kids they have a live steer as you are walking in (just warrants a quick look), a slide (kids absolutely love it) and some old fashioned video games.    -For the adults there is a dance floor with live country music, and REALLY GOOD FOOD!  Everyone in our party loved their food, even the vegetarian (I know how cruel can we be to bring a vegetarian to a BBQ joint).  I shared one of those GIGANTIC meals for 2 or more with a friend, and each item (ribs, chicken, shrimp, etc) was somehow falling off the bone with amazing flavor.  -The only compliant I had was the service was a little off the longer we stayed.  When we first got there the service was amazing, someone stopped by our table every 5-10 minutes.  But after a couple hours of eating and drinking the server couldn't be found.  -Overall, if you are visting the Tempe area for a couple days (like going to Spring Training) with a group of friends or family, you really should try it out you will not be disappointed.",

It was held out in the big barn, and I gotta say it was a great venue for a concert  I should qualify that.  It's a great venue if you're on the taller side.  I'm 6'2 so sightlines weren't a problem for me, but the stage is only a few feet off the ground, so if you were a shorter person you were kinda S.O.L.  One of the nicest things was how cool it was in there.  There's plenty of AC being pumped down from vents all along the ceiling, and a great breeze coming in.    And then there's the view again.  Fantastic to step outside for a beer or a break and have the whole valley spread out before you  There was one downside, though I don't know if it's an issue normally.  All the tickets for this concert were Will Call, so there was a ginormous clusterfuck of a line to get into the show because they had to find every freaking person on a printed out list.  If I didn't love RCPM as much as I do, I may have bailed and left  Once you were in though, I loved it.  The Rooste is a great concert venue, with plenty of beer/liquor stations so never a wait for a beverage",

Even though it is a beautiful view do not expect what you are paying for you get $5 service and good at a $25 price. The bus boy was the most attentive person at our table :)",

    "text": "Definitely a horrible disappointment.  In short, wish I'd never been.  We went there because some in our group liked the place and said it was a must do.  First off, the service was lacking.  We had made reservations for a party of 6 (for a weeknight) and arrived on time.  We were told by the hostess that the wait was 20-30 minutes.  It seemed beyond them as to what a reservation was for.  Thankfully we only waited 10 minutes before we were seen to our table.  I appreciate what they're trying to do with the lamp lighting but it causes an issue.  No one could read the menus.  We grabbed another lamp from a table that wasn't being used, fished out cellphones and a lighter, then made our dinner choices.  I observed many tables later doing the same thing, so it wasn't just us.  Noise was another issue, as we couldn't hear each other talk.  Now it might seem considering the area and how we were having problems with seeing and hearing each other, that we might be some old grouchy people.  This isn't the case as my wife and I are 30/29 and another couple is in their 40's.  Our waiter showed up pretty quickly but seemed absent several times throughout the night.  They started us off with as many rolls as people and had to ask twice before we got any more.  This was a trend, having to ask for things more than once, as we had to do this for refills (the glasses hold about 1/2 a liter and still went empty), things we ordered that didn't arrive with the rest of our food, and to-go boxes.  Most everyone thought the food was alright, definitely not worth the price tag.  My steak was better in an omelet than as a steak.  Someone else bought dinner for my wife and I and we still didn't think it was worth it.  This is one of the few places I wish I could give 0 stars.",

    "text": "Very disappointing....our party of 6 ordered a variety of items and the majority were unhappy.  The Cowboy \"Stuff\" for two is way more than the kitchen staff can handle and serve fresh/warm.  The chicken was old and served dried out, the medallions of beef were unchewable, including the second attempt at them, the seafood skewer was some type of overcooked fish pieces but the two breaded shrimp on the tray were great, along with the seasoned potato wedges.  Those that ordered ribs were pleased.  The steak person was also disappointed with their overcooked and tough meat.  Even the Manager had to apologize saying \"the medallions of beef are tough to cook properly\".   He was used to giving a 20% discount on the food knowing that their meat quality is inferior and the staff can't seem to get it right.... Far too many other good dining options in the area.  Good luck to you....",

    "text": "I have lived in the East Valley for nearly thirty years.  I've been very curious about this place, & went with out of town visitors for the first time last night.  2 of us ordered the cowboy special.  First of all, I thought that all of the was way, way too salty.  If you have heart trouble or kidney trouble do not eat here.  The only thing on the platter that was good was the ribs, beef kabobs, & corn on the cob.  At $25+ per person, this is way way too expensive.  I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't overreacting, so I asked my guests, & they were in total agreement with me.  This includes a 10 year old who got a cheeseburger off the kids menu & he didn't like that.  I forgot that I have mobility issues at times due to a bad back.  This place has very poor outside lighting.  There are no signs indicating to drive up the hill to park, so I parked at the bottom of the hill, & ended with probably a quarter mile walk up a very steep hill.  Also, trying to get into or out of the restaurant, good luck.  Getting out I was clutching onto the railing on the left side because the incline getting down to the parking lot was very steep.  If my cousin hadn't been right with me when I stumbled, she grabbed me to keep me from falling.  I hope the management considers something about addressing these issues.  Next time I want a steak, I won't be going to Rustler's, something like Stuart Andersons is much better.",

We were seated by the exit door on the lower level.  During our entire dinner all we listened to was the dropping of bus pans, glasses hitting the floor, trays banging, etc.  We mentioned to the waitress, Kayla, to see if they could not make so much noise.  It did not stop.  No manager even came over to the table.  I finally walked backed to the area and asked them to not make so much noise.  This really spoiled our special occasion.  Our bill was $62.88 plus tip.  This was a very unpleasant experience.  Contacted Rustler's Rooste on 4/1/19 and spoke with Patricia, no call back from manager. Contacted Rustler's Rooste on 4/25/19 and spoke with Ashland. Manager finally called back.  Would only give us 20% off and VIP seating if we came back.  This was very disappointing and very poor customer service.  Will not go back again.",

The feel of the place is cowboy and really fun, family friendly place with a live band, a slide, and a great place to bring your family. We ordered a prime rib and the cowboy dinner for two with lots of meat! The bread was great but the meat wasn't. All of our meat was over cooked and dry. Which was highly disappointing. Maybe it was the night that we chose to go, but as of right now it is not a place that I am aching to come back to. Our waitress was fantastic, she was cheerful and on top of everything.  Now, as for the bull that they keep in a tiny pin out front...not so great. Although it brings in attention, I don't think that it's a great place to keep an animal that size in.",

The steak, I wonder if it was even steak?  The chicken was so dry I had to wash it down.  Equivalent to Applebee's with a price tag that matches Charleston's. Waste of $180.00. Save your hard earned money.  So disappointed we don't go out often so we try and make it special when we do.  Never again, back to Charleston's!!!",

First of all, the two stars are all for the food. The food was good and brought out in a timely manor. Now, maybe because I worked as a waitress for 5 years so I kinda have high expectations on service? But the service we've received, Not worth the three stars. We are a party of 8, so it is mandatory to be charged at least 18% tips. Which is fine, and we expected that. But the service was not worth I would say even 10%!  The waitress did not greet us or acknowledge us until maybe 15 minutes after we sat down, asked us if we need anything other drinks besides water, then nowhere to be found afterwards. I have to hunt down our waitress and tell her we need to place our order. During the time when we were waiting for our food, most of our water are empty. Our waitress at this point, were standing literally 5 feet away from us, just standing there, not doing anything. So if she can just stood there and not doing anything, why can't she come over And check on our drinks? I don't know. I waited for a good couple minutes until I literally have to wave at her and ask her for water. And THAT was the ONLY time we got our water top up in our cup during the whole time we were dining there.  She checked on us ONCE after the food came and asked how it taste and THAT IS IT until she bring us the check. I mean, does that mean if you know you're getting the 18% mandatory, then you don't need to provide any service? There's more to this dining experience that we were upset about the service, and I am planning to call them tomorrow to speak with the manager since I didn't get a chance to do so because I had visitors with us and I don't want to make the situation awkward. I would not go back there again, even though food was good, but it wasn't something that I can't find anywhere else.",

    "text": "It's the Year of the Rooster every single month!  This restaurant can do no wrong!  Ordered the Prime Rib (Medium Rare), Loaded Baked Potato, and Ribs.  The Prime Rib was cooked to perfection.  Typically when we ask for the meat to be cooked rare, rarely does that happen. Well, it happened at this joint.  Well done!  The Loaded Baked Potato looked like a Rolls Royce with all the trimmings inside this luxury vehicular potato.  The butter and sour cream hit the seam of my gut.    The BBQ ribs had an awesome tangy sauce that required me to order Round 2.  It is an all-you-can eat dish.    Great tasting beans.  No flatulence.  Corn on the cob did not make us feel robbed.    All in all, a great meal for $77.  Located next to the Arizona Grand, this Cowboy joint has as large of a presence as John Wayne on the Silver Screen.    Yes Haw!",

We had a reservation for Saturday night and still had to wait an extra 20 minutes past the reservation time for them to set up our table.  The hostess who seated us had long blonde hair and clearly had zero interest in being at work that day. She was pretty much the opposite of inviting.  Thankfully our interaction with her was short-lived.  Our server was a really nice guy who was efficient and honestly did a great job.  I did not catch his name but he had a full plate because this place is busy all the time and Saturday night was no exception.  He kept his composure in the face of the general level of chaos of the restaurant and really did his job well. If you are looking for a nice quiet sit down restaurant, this is not the place for you.  This restaurant has always been very loud every time we've been there and just packed full of families with kids.  We were a large party and I had no chance whatsoever of hearing what was going on at the other end of our table.  There is also live music playing, which is actually cool but it does contribute to the noise level.  The views from the restaurant are amazing - you see right across the east valley and have perfect views of Camelback Mountain as well.  Now for the food... I ordered the salmon which came with some kind of rice dish.  The salmon itself was fine but the rice was gross.  Your meal comes with a little piece of corn on the cob, which was good, and then they serve some family style stuff for the table - a bread basket containing biscuits and fry bread (all of the bread in our basket was stale), a salad which is absolutely drenched in ranch dressing (if you like ranch I suppose this is fine but there was no option given for those who don't like ranch), and beans, which had tomatoes in them and were a little too spicy.  I honestly only ever come here with my in-laws who like the restaurant but it's just a little too loud, too full of small kids, and the food just isn't that great.  Some of our party had burgers and said they enjoyed those.  My husband had a steak that he liked.  My friend had a side of mashed potatoes and I actually liked those.  Kids seem to love the restaurant and it's definitely a spot that tour buses frequent.  If you have small kids they should enjoy themselves here.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what the reviews less than 5-stars here are about but this place is a national treasure! I'm so glad that we experience this...experience. From the moment you approach the front door, the fun begins.  The first thing you see is a bull in his pin, next to the front entrance. No big deal, but the kids thought it was pretty cool. Then you proceed through what looks like a mineshaft. I dug that, no pun intended. Then you enter the two story-saloon/restaurant that is Rustler's Rooste.   You start on the second story, and first up is a slide you have an option to take down to the first floor. Unique, but we took the stairs. The kids, however, had a hay-day on that slide, going down it too many times to count. Live music in that old-school country style plays as your host/hostess seats you. We opted for window seating, which, being on the edge of South Mountain, gives you a pretty scenic view of the city.   The servers seemed to all be dressed in cowboy attire, to fit the theme, and they're very friendly to boot; again, no pun intended. As busy as they were, we were shocked at how fast the food was in front of us after ordering. Let me rewind though just a bit - complimentary delicious rolls with your choice of butter and cinnamon butter are served before you even order. After you order, you get an enormous bowl of salad, also complimentar, brought out to you. By this time, you barely have room for the food you ordered, but that's okay, I don't dislike being spoiled, and bringing home leftovers is always a viable option.   Ok, so the portion sizes are generous, and by generous I mean HUGE. Needless to say, my wife and I did not come close to finishing our plates. Oh and our kids also given a  complimentary steak and fries because that's how they roll (when parents order something), although I believe that policy may be changing some soon. So how was the food you ask? The ginormous burger was perfect-o, thick and juicy. Their wings were large and flavorful, and not fatty like other places I've had with bigger-than-normal portion sizes. The salad was the opposite of some of the dry salads I've had elsewhere, drenched in their house ranch. I really enjoyed everything. 5-stars, 10/10.  As mentioned before, Rustler's Rooste is not just a restaurant, it's an experience!   P.S. The (also complimentary) Birthday (peach mango?) Cotton Candy was also something to be had!",

    "text": "Went there last night for an early dinner.   Definitely a place set up for bringing our out-of-town guests.   There is even a bull right outside the front door, which makes for an ambiance of a ranch -- if you know what I mean. ...  The place is three stories, top, middle and basement.   We asked for a table with a view, which means we went down to the basement.   I suppose there are views at the top and maybe even in the middle.   If it is cooler, we could have even sit on the patio, which we did later as it got dark.   I decided on the double barrel margarita after asking our server, Craig, which was better: the double barrel or the Clooney margarita.   He said the double barrel.   My companion had the Arizona prickly pear juice margarita.   My drink tasted like a margarita.   Nothing special, nothing different.  He wanted to try the rattlesnake on the appetizer list, as well as he got the shirt.  When it came, it looked and tasted like popcorn shrimp.   Or maybe popcorn chicken.   Dunno.    It tasted mostly of the fried batter.   It was hard to find the snake.   It came with fries, which aren't bad.   At $18, dunno.   It could have been popcorn chicken. ...   The dish even had part of a skeleton.   Were we supposed to eat it??   I've seen rattlesnakes in our 'hood.   Don't know if that little skeletal system was that of a snake or what.   I had the t-bone steak dinner and he had the half slab Memphis-style BBQ pork ribs.   Dinner comes with a family-style salad as well as corn on the cob and beans.   Oh, yes.   I forgot to mention we had biscuits and Indian fry bread to begin.    Not bad.   The fry bread was, well, fried bread.   The biscuits were flakey and all right with the whipped margarine.  Gosh, by the time I ate the biscuits and the fries, the snake and the fries, I was kinda full. ...   As well as after sipping on the margarita.   Therefore, I picked at my steak and sampled his ribs.   His ribs weren't bad.   They were moist, and smokey, and the sauce on top gave it some flavor.   He wasn't impressed, though.    My steak was tender and, well, grilled.   What I would expect with a t-bone steak.   It came with the carrots, beans and corn on the cob.  Craig was efficient and professional.   Not friendly and charming, that's for sure.   Just efficient and professional.   We sat on the patio as it got dark to watch the city views.   That's what I liked.     It's not cheap -- a typical tourist trap.   I've tasted better food and had better service.   Would I return?   Only if invited.   I don't know if I'd even bring my out-of-town guests for the ambience.   Too fake and the food is expensive and the service and views aren't all that profound.",

    "text": "Hello,  I am writing in regards to my dining experience on August 3rd 2019 at 6pm. I made a reservation with the help and flexibility of the staff at your establishment that same day for my party of 14 for my daughter and husbands birthday. It was made with ease and I was anticipating the same type of environment once we arrived. Our servers name was Joe (female, I hope that name is correct) , and the manager assisting was David. During our time in Rustlers Rooste we did have to wait to order until a number of our party members arrived, this was understandable to our waitress and we appreciated that. At the time of payment, which our bill was sizable of course, only one check option was offered and we had to split our payments. My grandmother, amongst others, had separate forms of payment, which again was communicated as agreeable when I called to make the reservation and upon arrival. My grandmother handed our waitress her card, at the same time as my aunt, both clearly expressing what to charge. Upon her return the cards were charged incorrectly as noticed by the receipts provided. The waitress offered to rectify the charges, but only returned one card to my aunt. My grandmother did not receive her card in return, without the waitresses assistance as well as her vehemently insisting she handed the card back to my grandmother, the card was misplaced. We asked the waitress to check the register, also her pocket to be sure she didn't have it, as we believed it was last in her possession. The majority of our party of 14 were looking for the card, as my grandmother is 80, and this was upsetting to her. The waitress returned again, stating she gave the card back to my grandmother. My aunt then politely asked for a manager, we expressed our problem in detail to David asking for his help, that we cannot leave until the card is found, in which his reply was \"well it looks like you guys are going to be here all night\", but did not offer assistance in searching or at least trying to facilitate a resolution. We then find the card laying in the hay on the floor under another table 6 feet away from where my grandmother was sitting, but in the pathway of the register and our table where the waitress walked back and fourth to tender our forms of payment. On her way back to the table we pointed out the card, which it was retrieved and returned to my grandmother, but this was after about a 30 minute search for the card with little to no accountability on behalf of the staff. Even when we asked for the table to please be cleared so we may look nobody came to clear the table. I took it upon myself to see if there was a way, especially being the first (and now the only time) we visited Rustlers Rooste, to try to speak with the manager so there was some clarity provided on what happened and how it was handled poorly at every stage. He was unwilling to accommodate us to any extent at this visit or the next. All that was said was he was \"wrong for saying that\". My family and I were just out seeking celebration for two of our loved ones, including my grandmother that, tried her best to stay that late to enjoy our time together. I'm very sad to write this because I did have high hopes for our first time there, but the wait staff and manager could have done much better in being understanding and trying to help. There was also no apology offered on behalf of the waitress.  I'm writing simply to communicate our experience, in hopes that no one else has to endure this type of service in the future.   I'm sure your experience may be better dining in a small group or alone. But this was simply a mess.",

Every table around us had at least one kid with them. Which is fine, because we ended up knocking over an entire glass of water and needed to stand and bop around with her. I'm at the point in my life we're we now eat in the kid's corner.   So the food is pretty good, very large portions for very affordable pricing. They also bring out fry bread, rolls and salad even before you order. So come hungry.   The view is beautiful. I would recommend coming right before sunset, so you can see the valley during the day and watch the sun go down.  There is a slide. And a bull outside the front door. And there is sawdust on the floor (which helped our spilled glass of water).",

Food quality is so so.  Salad at start for whole table to share, but salad was on the wet side causing dressing to be diluted. Steaks are barley seasoned with salt and pepper,  mashed potatoes were bland with hint of seasonings.  Get the loaded baked potatoe, that was very good.  Beans included with dinner is baked beans in a BBQ sauce.  They offer complimentary cotton candy at the end for a nice sugar rush if so desired.  Dont forget the indoor Slide by the live music stage, a huge hit for the kiddies and even some adults!",

So if you want a touristy, loud, family-friendly place to grub then this Western themed relic is your stop when in Phoenix.   Honestly most locals don't even come here!   Sawdust on the floor and a live country band welcomed us in. We were seated right away (we had reservations for 10 people). But even if there's two of you call ahead because this place was packed.   No rattlesnake! Bummer! Maybe the wranglers had an off day? So this was disappointing because it's a trendy one of a kind menu item.  Service was super friendly. Our kids had fun going down the  slide while going downstairs and cotton candy was a fun treat. Food was great and views of the sunset spectacular.   The only downer was the the bussing of the table which was super duper slow. We had finished our meals ready for dessert and our giant salad bowl and appetizer plates were still on the table, I had to wave someone down. So there was a major disconnect.  Nonetheless, a fun place to visit for a special occasion.",

Then you approach the hag I mean hostess, no I mean HAG area. When we walked up there were 4 girls standing behind the hostess desk & not s single 1 said hi or welcome to the restaurant. They all seemed wayyyyy more occupied in other things than greeting a first time customer with a smile. The main girl taking the names & party info for people was so grump she made you feel like and inconvenience when requesting a seat.   The wait time was quoted at 45-1hr, but we were sat sooner which was nice.   Then, dealing with our waiter..... the guy was so incredibly soft spoken we honestly couldn't hear barely anything he was saying. All in all we will be back because the food was really good and the restaurant is fun. The hostesses I hope have changed their attitudes & the waiters listen to the customers especially if it's in regards to foods they can or can't have.",

I ordered a filet done medium; I received a well done shoe-leather piece of strip steak without a word. Needless to say, I kept it, which I regret. There was no flavor with the steak and the corn came from a frozen bag.  My wife ordered steak medallions and grilled shrimp. She got 2 small medallions and steamed shrimp on a skewer. This is the second chance for this place and will not return.",

    "text": "What a fantastic experience!  While visiting Phoenix, some friends who live there took us to Rustler's Rooste because they wanted to show us something unique in Phoenix.  The restaurant is up on a bluff overlooking Phoenix which offers breathtaking evening vista views.  The old southwest theme is masterfully carried out in all aspects of the restaurant, from a long-horned steer stationed near the entrance to the live country-western band playing in the center of the restaurant.  Bring the kids and let them zip down the slide to get from one floor to the next.  Us three guys all ordered the Barbecued Beef Ribs, which were all you can eat for only $19.95. I was only able to eat 1  1/2 servings because the family-style salad and fresh-baked biscuits were very generous and tasty, and the beef ribs were monstrous.  My only slight critique was that their sauce was a touch salty for my taste.  I'll go back every single time I'm in Phoenix!",

However when you first walk in there's a lonely live bull at the entrance in 103 degrees. I was told it's their mascot. It's a steak house, I think he would be happier hanging out with his cow friends. If you're an animal lover it will make you lose your appetite! We went with co workers so it's ideal for a social gathering. Right ambiance with a country live band. The food was average, some not well seasoned other dishes too salty.",

    "text": "This place must've been awesome in its day. I hear there's quite a view but giant parties of 20 stopped from being able to enjoy drinks outside. A group of six and we ordered potato skins, quesadillas, sliders, zucchini/fried mushrooms, nachos, and wings. The people who ate the mushrooms said they were okay at best and left many in the taco shell it was delivered in. I tried to enjoy a fried zucchini but the batter fell off leaving a limo mushy vegetable in my hand. Nachos-there were about a dozen or so chips smothered in congealed cheeses. Skins were the best plate on the table. Wings were good if you e had really good wings but weren't cooked long enough to have a crisp skin so definitely request that if you order. There were quesadillas left over because the meat 'tasted weird' the others said who split one leaving all the other pieces on the plate. Service was great full star for that. Skins were decent full star for that.  All the food made my stomach a bit off just a few hours later which is why I felt the need to write this review. Be picky.  Parking is tight-ambiance is strange because it wants that ranch feel but it plays off as dated instead. The lanterns on the table are awkward in the bar area because the tables are so small.   There's a bull in a pen when you approach the front door named horney and it looked bored and trapped which didn't help lift my spirits about my birthday celebration.  Strange little place with a lot of potential for updates to add more seating and perhaps help by reconstructing the entrance to the building so it won't be so steep would be a great improvement. I hear there's a slide somewhere in there too.",

Be sure to call ahead for reservations and make sure to confirm the morning of (they mixed up our time with our party size).  We arrived about 20 minutes before our 7pm reservation and hung out on the upper level near the bar. From there, you can look down at the stage, dance floor and tons of families eating with kids having fun taking turns going down the slide adjacent to the stairs. Even some young-at-heart adults were using it. Once seated, we admired our fairly scenic view from atop the Arizona Grand.  The menu that night displayed several sizes of prime rib, a New York steak, several seafood options and a turkey dinner. Three of us opted for the New York steak and my future mother-in-law had the turkey. I enjoyed the flavor of the medium rare cut, albeit chewier than I like. A dab of A1 sauce was a nice complement, or even the sauce from the Cowboy beans given to us to share. The turkey plate was the most attractive of all incorporating your usual Thanksgiving fare.  Though I'm used to a Christmas dinner hosted at home, Rustler's Roost was a highly suitable alternative that could become a family tradition.",

We already had our drink and snack at the bar and we were full by the time our food got at our table. There was live music but it was so crazy busy that you were not able to enjoy the country music. Kids were crying and running all over the place. I have a 6 year old son but this was beyond tolerable.   The steak was ok and very very over priced. Our host was nice and courteous. Portions are big and very American. No sophistication and no flare. Nothing especial.   There are magicians and ballon folders walking among the guests. You have to also pay them because it is not nice to be jerk. It feels like you are in a big carnival and nobody cares for you and they just want you to pay more.   I believe if you come in the middle of the week, you may have a different experience. This was my first and last. I can go to 2 nicer restaurant with the money I spent here. I am so mad and disappointed.  If you are someone who cares about your food and ambience, this is not a place for you.",

    "text": "For years I heard about this place and always wanted to go, so I thought for a \"date night\" it would be a nice change of pace.   First off, the cell phone GPS got us lost. It took us through a community and right to a locked gate. I could see the restaurant on top of the hill but could get to it. I ended up calling the restaurant and spoke to a confused young girl. She didn't understand how I could be lost and had no idea houses were right below them.   After a few minutes of searching, I located the place. The parking lot was packed (it was Saturday night) but there was a nice gentleman there with a shuttle to help us to the top of the hill.   The restaurant itself is pretty rustic. There's a huge long horn steer outside, so the smell was a little strong but manageable. Inside was a live band and unique designed layout with a kid slide and all.   We had a nice window seat which overlooked the city lights. The view was great and so was the friendly staff. The issue I had the most was with the food.   I was not impressed to say the least. We ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" which was basically a sample of ribs, chicken, fish, shrimp and filet mignon. The sides were potato wedges, spicy baked beans, pineapple coleslaw , corn on the cob and a side of veggies. The meal also came with rolls, biscuits and a salad. Overall cost was $47 and with a tip, about $55 total for the two of us.   Everything was pretty bland and nothing that stood out as great tasting. I would much rather have gone to Pork on the Fork, a local BBQ place two minutes from my house. Instead I drove 40 minutes across the valley for this? Very disappointing to me.   If it wasn't for the cool atmosphere and helpful staff, I would give this place a two star rating. Save your money and enjoy something close to your house instead.",

    "text": "This is one of the strangest places I have ever been.  This restaurant has a cow that lives at the front of the restaurant. He looks concerned.  The space is split into two, but I'm not sure how. I know this because when we asked for a table, the lady said that we could sit in some seats now, but other seats weren't available until later. I wasn't clear on which seats were available and which weren't, which concerned me greatly because then she said I could have a seat, and later I could have a different seat, which meant I had to figure out which seats were ok so we just sat near some other people. Eventually we switched to other seats, at which point, luckily, someone showed us where to sit.  The entire theme of this place is like, inside a barn or something. \"Western Cowboy\" or something like that.  Lots of wood, lots of steaks and meats, and people dressed 'country' style or something like that. People were wearing boots and I don't think it was because they were outside hanging out with the cow.  The food was pretty good. People complain about their meat not being done like they ordered it, but for the love of dog, you're sitting in a giant barn and there's a cow outside - the strangest thing going on here isn't your meat being cooked a bit off.  The service was ok - they weren't busy at the time, but when we needed a spoon to dish out the sides with, that took about 5 minutes, which isn't a long time, but it feels like a long time when you've got food sitting in front of you. I'm also not saying the waitress didn't have something better to do - she did a good job - I don't know what was going on during those 5 minutes. Might have been problems with the cow or something. Just saying - it wasn't speedy.  But hey, the place has a great view. I'd say to check it out, but it's not the kind of place I'd bring a date unless I was already drunk. More of a family place or maybe there's some whole kind of country-western thing I don't know about, so if you're into that you might like checking it out too.  Check it out!",

Now in the winter not sure about the wait time.  We got there just before sunset and it was amazing. The view is beyond breathtaking and worth the drive alone.   Once at our table the menu was a bit confusing as it looked like a newspaper with nothing inside. They charge for soda water which is a bummer...but plain water is okay.   The salad is served family style with the dressing already on it. I just asked for more plain salad to mix with the other salad. The dressing is very good. I ordered a steak well done and I should have ordered either pork chicken or salmon. I am not a big steak eater. Of course it was a bit dry and chewy. The corn was to die for as were the steamed veggies. The cowboy beans were okay just not my thing. The biscuits were a bit tasteless but the honey butter added flavor but I wasn't wanting to eat that much of it.  They do have dessert but the stock standard is bringing cotton candy to everyone. You can line  dance and enjoy the patio overlooking the city for as long as you want too. Will come again.",

Shuttle from nearby hotel was perfect as we were very unfamiliar with the area.  Many choices but we eventually settled on the swordfish and ribeye.  Both cooked to perfection.  More food than we knew what to do with but all of it so very wonderful. Staff friendly and quick.  Noticed near us at a family table there was a guy making balloon animals and one doing magic tricks.  Nice easy shuttle back to our hotel.  Next night we had a very large group of hungry gymnasts.  They had the best time, was so much fun to watch them soak up all the entertainment.  I requested the magician to stop over as well as the balloon guy.  That magician was AMAZING!  Food was wonderful, even the kids enjoyed the rattlesnake and cactus bites.  Fun slide inside that even the adults enjoyed.  The view was pretty, hard to see if you are deeper inside the building but still breathtaking.  Would love to stop again if ever in the area.",

    "text": "Kind of like Disneyland (Frontierland actually)  The prices are pretty low for the food described, but the quality and prep is mediocre at best.  Stuck at the AZ Grand Resort for a family wedding and avoiding the rehearsal dinner by saying I arrived too late.  Naughty me - maybe this is my punishment. Well, it's not that bad, but I would only come here for a birthday party for a child under 10, or when I'm a captive audience, like now.  We tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries.  Definitely the highlight of the night.  Prime rib was cooked as ordered, but the meat was awfully chewy.  Sides included: Biscuits and fry bread with butter and spiced butter:  only had it one other time, but this definitely didn't measure, and the biscuits were not very good Green salad:  Fresh greens, but flavorless dressing and very little of it Green beans:  Overcooked, but tasted as if they were fresh Corn on the cob:  Watery, soggy Baked beans:  Pretty good, but very small quantity Baked yams:  Fresh, and well prepared, unfortunately, I'm not a yam fan Service was very artificially friendly.  Everyone raved about the view, but I was unimpressed with the lights of Phoenix.  I think I'm jaded.  Food:  20/40 Service:  15/20 intang.Atm:  14/20 Value:  16/20 Overall:  65= D+= 2 stars",

    "text": "Love the rustic cowboy western atmosphere. Okay so it's a little kitsch with the sad lonely steer out front in the mosh pit and taxidermy rattle snakes, but it's fun; especially with the indoor slide that big boys can go swim too.  Large cavernous space with plenty of room for indoor and outdoor seating.  Live country western music every evening and dancing for those so inclined.  Love the evening view of the camelback mountain and other ranges in the distance.  Can also accommodate very large groups.  I have been here with my son several times on our annual Cactus League spring training trips and haven't had a bad meal yet.  Food is reasonably priced and generous portions accompanied by all the fixings including Indian fry bread with cinnamon butter or hot biscuits with honey. A few good choices for non red meat eaters too.  I have been satisfied with the mesquite grilled marinated sword fish; tender, fresh and juicy! My son loves the wrangler bone in ribeye. Smoked on the grill and cooked perfectly.  The compliment of cooked carrots were surprisingly good as they were crispy and slightly sweet.  Cotton candy a nice touch at the end with the bill.",

Unfortunately I was dissatisfied with our server Adrian (sorry to call you out man) he wasn't very attentive or engaging with us and several times throughout our stay he either didn't clarify with us and mistakenly took away our salad plates when we had asked him for another family style salad and we all just felt awkward. My mom asked for a scoop of ice cream and he said \"sure no problem\" but sadly it never arrived. The beans we got weren't very tasty and they were served almost cold because it seemed like they must have been sitting out for awhile. We did however still enjoy our stay and the steaks we got were good not great. The fun part was getting some cotton candy at the end of our meal and all of us getting to tear into it like we were at a state fair! 6.5/10",

    "text": "Boy, where to start. If you are from the Denver area this can be compared to a steakhouse version of Casa Bonita. No cliff divers here, but you will find a bull, complete with smell at the entrance, a slide going from the main level down to the dining level, a live band and a dance floor that may or may not be flooded with a Sweet 16 party. The only thing this place is missing is a mechanical bull, which would definitely bump it up to four stars and guarantee repeat business from me.   The food is average. We were brought biscuits and fry bread with two different types of butter. I found the biscuits to be too dry, but the fry bread was good. I mean, it's basically a donut, how can you not like it. I ordered checken with bbq sauce and a baked potato. All of their vegetables are pre-made and soaked in butter and the only salad dressing available without dairy was oil and vinegar. So, maybe not the best option if you are allergic to dairy or lactose intolerant. They bring a gigantic bucket of what tasted like bubblegum flavored cotton candy at the end of the meal. None of us asked about dessert, so I am no help there, sorry.  The service, live music and the view were the best parts of this establishment. Our server had been working there 26 years and was so kind and helpful in making sure nothing I ate had dairy. They also have a bus that will take you back to your hotel, even if it is not close! So go ahead and have that top shelf margarita and cut a rug!",

Ok with that even though it means standing in entrance hallway. 30 minutes later checked with hostess, she tilde 3 people in front of me. Then seated at least 5 tables. Checked in again, she told me I was next to be seated then seated 3 more tables. By now over an hour has passed, it is after 8pm. This time hostess gives me the line that she asked her manager 10 minutes ago to find us a table. Only 3 in our party, could see empty tables by the window the entire hour + we were there. Left hungry & not happy. Be prepared for a long wait.....",

I was with a group of about 7 people. The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good...if a little too saucy...with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL!!! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat...the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs....Just Awful.  The Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare.   The atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars, but it is a restaurant after all...so good food should be the focus",

    "text": "Rustler's Rooste is a venerable Phoenix tradition.  Many people have come here and had a great time.  I last came here for an event with former students from my college, so my experience is probably atypical.  Our event was part update on whats happening on campus, part memorial, and quite traditional.  We do it every year.  This was perhaps, the wrong venue for us.  We did not have the solemn atmosphere that the memorial part of the event demands, and the other groups around us were having so much fun that I could barely hear the speaker.  No wait staff were required for our group, so I can't tell what service might be like as a regular diner.  Our meal was a buffet style bbq chicken dinner, which I probably would avoid if I could. It was a bit overdone, to the point where it may have been better to skip the chick half and make do with the beans (bland), corn (waterlogged cobbettes), rolls (good for crumbs, but not much else), and the afterthought salad.  If I didn't know that much of my fee was going to scholarships, I'd think that I got ripped off.",

It was very tender and juicy! The atmosphere is also great they have live music, magicians, and people making balloons. The magicians they have are awesome!! I go to Rustler's Rooste a couple times a year and have had the pleasure of watching both magicians and they always leave me scratching my head wondering how they did that. Of the multiples times in my life I have been to Rustler's Rooste I have never had s bad experience it's always a great time!! If you have people visiting I would definitely take them there as well as if you are visiting Phoenix you should for sure go!",

I got the T-Bone steak, which was reasonably tasty. But, ultimately the food was very similar to going to your backyard and throwing some steaks from QFC on the grill. Certainly nothing wrong with that, but maybe need to go further when you call yourself a steak house.  The outdoor eating area was amazing. The view was for miles. Inside is very \"Texas\", but I think that's what the people come for. Pretty good joint.",

I mean they have a bull out front at the entrance. Once you get in there is a slide or stairs. You can choose which you prefer to get down to the first level. They have live bands. They are usually older bands playing country music. They start you off with bread and it is delicious. The food on the other hand was decent but maybe not worth the price. It's fun to try once but the novelty quickly wears off. Parking somewhat sucks. Hope you don't have a hard type getting up stairs because you have to go up about 3 stories of stairs just to get from the parking to the restaurant.",

Denver has Casa Bonita (don't try and disown it Denver, you know what I'm talkin' about) Boston has the Oyster House and others, New York has Sardi's and any number of other unique places.  I guess Phoenix has Rustler's Roost.  They capture the old west, the cowboy mythos and gitsch all together in one location and pair it with decent food, friendly service and a great view of the city.  I wouldn't dine here regularly but it is a good place to bring visitors.  They definitly get packed and there is not enough parking on the hill top so you may have a hike if they are really busy.",

    "text": "Rustler's Rooste is unique. I went with a large group as part of a conference but I can't even imagine going here as a regular dinner table of 4 people. The place is huge & loud.  When we arrived we went in the door marked handicap access with my elderly mom. There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we'd entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going \"past the slide\" & we'd come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes.  The area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside.  The food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I've ever tasted on a separate buffet.  One of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition.  Would I go back on a return to Phoenix? Likely not...this is more of a one stop novelty for me.",

    "text": "We ended up visiting this restaurant one day, after our barista at Starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her 'other job' weren't tipping well, forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant.  So we show up later that evening.  Anyways, the decor is rustic but outdated.  The menu is limited, and you have no options.  \"What do you mean by no options\", you ask?  What type of salad dressing would you like?  Ranch?  Not a fan of Ranch?  Are you sure?  Because that's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix.  And to spice things up a bit, they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes.  And do you like corn on the cob, and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar?  I hope so, because that's all you gonna get.  Sound appetizing?  Sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward  your meaty centerpiece.  My wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib, which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having, and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth, void of flavor.  I ordered the 'Trail Hand' T-Bone, because I like T-Bones.  You should just call me 'T-Bone'.  Anyways, I asked them to serve it rare, because I had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak.  It was incredibly bland, and destitute of the juice I craved.  It wasn't dry.  More like a raw piece of steak.  Wanting to salvage the evening, I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem.  Strike three.  The apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever.  The dough was either overkneaded, or cooked in a microwave.  Kind of stretchy.  A few bites into this, and we knew... prognosis negative.  This review gets 2 stars, with one of those stars coming from the entertainment.  Yes, the one bright spot was the live music.  The band sounded great.  This trip turned out to be a complete WASTE of money that would have been better served back at the Seattle Conglomerate.",

We had reservations, so we were seated right away - which is good because the brief interaction with the lead hostess was not pleasant.     The views were fabulous and the atmosphere is festive.  Live band was fun and people were line dancing.  We ordered a filet and mixed grill.  Steaks were cooked to perfection and high quality.  The filet melted in your mouth. Daughter's pork ribs fell off the bone and had plenty of sauce.  Bread came out warm with choices of butter.  Our wait staff, Sandy, was right on point and very friendly.  You could tell she liked her job, knew what she was doing, and wanted you to be happy.  Portions were huge but we ordered the \"Cow Pie\" anyway.  The combination of coffee ice-cream and oreo crust was awesome!    Had a prickly pear drink that was a bit stiff, but lovely!  Nice to have a drink not watered down.   Overall, this dinner was quite a bargain for what you're getting.  It would get a 5-star if not for the sad greeting from the hostesses.  Great food, fun atmosphere, wonderful views, and fabulous service.  We will definitely be back!",

What an awesome experience from the cowboy theme, the fun atmosphere and spectacular view, we had a very memorable time. We had \"Cowboy Stuff\", a virtual feast of food, more than we could eat. It was all good!  No room for desert for us. After dinner we stepped outside to take in more of the view and get some photos. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats. Reasonably priced too!  We arrived at opening time and within 30 minutes it was filling up fast. When we arrived there were only a few cars in the lot but was full when we left.

Now as I sit here writing this review I wonder if I will be able to keep the food down tonight!   Honestly, the food for the entire table was unremarkable. It sounded good on the menu - the Mac n cheese... loaded potatoes... cowboy beans. They were over priced and low on flavor.   Honestly, the best part of the meal was the bread and salad. I regret not eating more of that so I would have at least been full for the $30 I spent on dinner.   To make matters worse the waiter seemed to hate his job or maybe it was just our table.

The atmoshphere of this place is its winning charm . few places like a steak house or similar give you the vibe they want you to have fun . this place with its built in slide and band that plays makes you feel like your having fun at dinner . not enough places do that, or some places over do it and get corny or cheesy .",

    "text": "Rustler's Rooste is expensive and the food isn't that great, but what they lack in flavor they make up for in personality, especially if you're bringing someone from out of town. It's got a cowboy atmosphere, a slide to get to your table, all that jazz. We started with the rattlesnake (very fried) and prickly pear fries, which were bland, but had a flavorful chipotle ranch dipping sauce. Next I ordered the chicken, which was not good, but it came with corn on the cob and cowboy beans, which were tasty. Decent drink selection and you get cotton candy for dessert.",

    "text": "First things first- This place is astronomically overpriced for the quality of food they're serving. My husband and I got the 1/2 BBQ chicken platter. Chicken was decent, not dry but not a whole lot of flavor either. It was served with half a plate of what looked like canned carrots and some plain corn on the cob. Aside from the food there are much bigger issues here. Our waitress was very sweet and appeared to be trying her best but definitely should have asked for some help. We had a party of about 20 and she had no help at all. As you can imagine, it took quite some time for our large group to order, about 45 minutes after we ordered she came back and said that she lost the entire order. After reordering our food, we waited about 20 more minutes. They gave one parties steak to another table so they had wait ANOTHER 15 minutes while letting all of their sides get cold.  FYI- They will not split checks. So our party of 20 had to go down the line and separate what each of us had and give her about 7 cards to run. As you can imagine, this did not go smoothly. All in all we were there for 5 hours..not by choice. Spoke with the manager who was completely blase and could care less of our troubles for what was supposed to be a fun night for my in-laws anniversary.   Tourist trap, food overpriced, slow service, bad management. You're better off going to a nice steak house and making it worth your money.",

My family of 4 spent $120 and that was with waters and 2 margaritas, no tons of liquor. I order the fried chicken and it was massive. I asked for no carrots, so of course I got a plate full of carrots. The chicken skin was good and crispy but the chicken itself was super bland. It had zero flavor at all. The cowboy beans that came for free was disgusting, I honestly would have been happier with a can of pork and beans and a can opener on the table. We also tried the rattlesnake.. you barely get any meat for the outrageous price tag.  I enjoyed the views and the building itself. The cotton candy was a nice and unexpected touch. I might come here again but I would split a meal (since they are so massive) and would try something else on the menu.",

All of us ordered steaks and they were run of the mill, tough but wasn't fatty, honestly have had better at outback (and I'm not a fan of that place).

Low key beer with a buddy? Sure. Family dinner? Uh huh. If you're reading this debating whether to go, do yourself a favor and just do it.   The theme here is laid-back, very Arizona. The restaurant itself was an old mineshaft, and it is HUGE. There are multiple levels, rooms, bars, indoor and outdoor spaces, and you really can't go wrong no matter where you're seated.   The dinner menu is steakhouse fare with some twists (I'm looking at you, rattlesnake, cactus fries, and cotton candy) and portions are tremendous. Just like those favorite jeans I mentioned, you won't be wowed by the food, but you won't ever be let down either. Steaks are all great and the beans and jalapeno mac are phenomenal, while other sides aren't particularly memorable, but still solid. Everything is also served with rolls and family-style salad.   There's live music most, if not all, days of the week, and if that's not enough to entertain you, check out the metal slide. No matter when you come, take your time walking around outside to take in the spectacular views of the entire valley. If you can, come at sunset!",

I tasted the proteins - and the brisket was absolutely the standout. I haven't had brisket in years and this was excellent. The chicken and ribs were really good, too. My colleagues enjoyed the food and the employees were terrific.   There was line dancing, live country bands and I heard that there was a mechanical bull onsite somewhere.

    "text": "We took some family there that was visiting from Wisconsin. I had the cattle baron filet medium rare, and the rest has that and a variety of steaks and ribs. It came with salad, cooked carrots, fry bread and biscuits, beans.There is no choice of sides that do not cost extra, baked potato for example. This can raise the bill substantially if not aware.  The main event, the filet, was cooked perfectly and was the most tender filet I have ever had. My wife's was slightly over cooked and had a fair amount of gristle for a sirloin. Mother in laws ribs were very good and tender. She had trouble eating them because they fell apart, indicating they were over cooked some.   The sides were ok. The cafeteria style carrots were sub par to be paired with a prime steak. The beans were delicious making up for the carrots some. The salad was good and came in one large bowl tossed to share with the table. Hope everyone likes the same dressing. Bread was delicious and warm, served with sweet butter and honey or plain homemade style. Drinks were the usual.   The atmosphere was very nice with a good view of the city lights. Live band wasn't overly loud and in tune. All in all, it was a good meal with good people. Prices are a bit on the high side considering the carrots and lack of side choices without an extra charge. Check it out for a special occasion or date.",

    "text": "Although this restaurant has been here since 1971, I had yet to visit until recently.  I don't often venture further in this area, as this is a mostly residential neighborhood. However, tucked atop a butte in the foothills of South Mountain, sits this restaurant.  The restaurant has a western theme, and the local lore is that it is built in a pot where local cattle rustlers used to hide, hence the name of the place.  It was just us for Christmas this year, since we'd done everything with our families on the previous Saturday. So, we drove around and finally settled on giving this place a shot.   The view is pretty spectacular. You may have to take quite a trek up the hill if you come when it's crowded. Happily we came before the rush. It became much busier afterwards.   Our waitress was professional and efficient. Our dishes came out promptly. You can't say that this place scrimps on food. We were given a big basket of rolls, plus a huge bowl of salad before our meal.  The entrees were humongous as well.  My Beloved loved her ham dish but I found my turkey dish to be a bit dry.  The sides were quite tasty.   Despite the dry turkey, we loved the restaurant and will be back again to try the normal menu. The menu we had was the holiday menu, so choices were limited. We look forward to seeing how things are on a more average day.",

The first thing we ate was the salad with the bread, the bread was good, the salad extremely full of creamy dressing to the point that it was mayonnaise with lettuce instead lettuce with dressing, all I could tasted was mayonnaise, terrible.  Steak kabobs really boring, no flavor.  Bbq chicken boring as well, dry and definitely lacking flavor.  Fried shrimp ok   Baked beans not my favorite Bbq ribs were burned on the outside and soft inside, nothing great but not terrible.  Coleslaw was really sweet mixed with pineapple and a cherry on top, I didn't like that mix, too sweet for a coleslaw. I didn't like it at all.  Fish skewers dry and burned   Potatoes were extremely salty too much salty seasoning. I literally couldn't eat them.  In other words I notice some places go crazy making greasy salty food thinking that it's going to make food tasty but actually it's not. Extra fat and extra cream or salt it's not necessary when a food is well done.  There's nothing more disgusting than greasy food.  I truly hope they change that extra load of cream in the salad, that's one of the things that I dislike the most.  Service was nice , the staff really friendly and the place has a nice view and nice ambiance.",

Our waitress Tosh was not the worst. However, Tosh was very bipolar. She had attitude one minute and the other minute was very nice. She barely came to check on our drinks and we had other waiters ask and retrieve things we needed. I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The ranch was astonishing and the wings were delish. My friend Kelly told me the Mac n cheese was Stellar. We were very disappointed when there was a one stall bathroom because we all had to pee so bad. I did indeed choose the three star rating because tosh did end the night off pretty good and again the ranch was phenomenal!",

    "text": "I've been to Rustler's Rooste on a number of occasions but was recently here on Saturday for a birthday dinner for a 3 year old. We had reservations so there was no wait. I did notice that throughout the night, there was a little wait but did not see that anyone was irritated. The slide was a big hit for our birthday boy and he even danced to a few songs the band was playing. The lighting in our area was pretty low so it was kind of hard to look through the menu, but I already knew what I wanted to order. Our waitress was nice and our drinks were always full. I ordered the prime rib and it was ok. I had to trim alot of fat off but the meat itself was good. The au jus was tasty although a little salty. I ordered the mashed potatoes but didn't care too much for it. It was bland, very chunky & the gravy didn't help much. Since we were celebrating a birthday, my friend ordered the birthday package. The staff came over to sing Happy Birthday with a cake and later on, we heard the band singing Happy birthday with his name inserted, so that was cool.",

Country music by a great band and accompanied by a slide on the right side of the stage.  The kids were having such a great time on that thing.    A couple of great things: The deep fried snake (tastes like chicken) The brew on tap The cotton candy afterwards  A couple disappointing things: The steak was done alright. The value of the meal It's definitely a tourist trap.  Ya'll come back now, ya hear...or maybe think about it.",

    "text": "Very large parking lot, I was wondering where they were going to seat all those people but the seating is on two levels with an outdoor patio, seemed to be plenty of room. We were seated fairly quickly for a Saturday evening. My only complaint about the seating is the restaurant is so dimly lit with low power bulbs that we all had our phones out with the flashlight feature on to read the menu. The live band that was playing was good, they played many cover songs of older country music.... the kind I think of as country, without the new age hip hop mixed into the song. We all tried the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus appetizer and although the cactus had a nice tang to it, what they say is True, rattlesnake tastes just like chicken.  The salad came out and it was just ok, not as crispy as I would have liked. The rolls and biscuits are good and the cinnamon butter is very good on them. I had the small filet and the texture and tenderness was great, very easy to cut and chew. It was cooked just right but definitely needed some salt to help bring out some flavor. The carrots were ok but the beans, I really liked the flavor of the beans that went along with dinner. We didn't have dessert but the kids got the cotton candy and shared some of that. All in all, not the best steak meal I've had but certainly not the worst. Next time I'm in the Phoenix area I would be willing to try this place again.",

    "text": "Very dissapointed in our experience. My wife ordered a sirloin, medium rare. It came out medium to medium well. She tried to eat it but it was so tough she had to send it back. The waitress asked if she would like the filet instead. It took 30-45 minutes for her meal to come back out.  The rest of us were finished eating already.  When it came out it was closer to medium  than medium rare. Very underseasoned and bland. And still so tough she only ate a couple of bites.  I ordered the prime rib. It was cooked to order but almost 1/3 of the piece was fat and grissle that couldn't be eaten.  It, too, was bland and not seasoned and so tough I had trouble cutting it with the provided steak knife.  Our waitress checked back with us about 10 minutes after she delivered our order, then we didn't see her again for about 45 minutes when she brought my wife's replacement meal. We had to ask for water, she didn't offer to refill it.  We asked for our check and waited about 20 minutes to get it. Once we put our bills down for her to pick up we waited another 10-15 minutes for her to even pick them up.  We paid full price for our meal. There was never an offer to comp my wife's meal.  This was definitely NOT a $140 meal.  We won't be returning and I strongly suggest you find somewhere else to eat.",

The building and slide was just how I remembered it and not much has changed over the years.   Was recently there for my HS reunion and was kind of surprised that the reunion was held outside on the patio in the middle of Nov at night. While they did have heaters your really couldn't venture to far without being cold quickly. We arrived and received one food ticket. My boyfriend and I had the steak (chicken was the other option) and the sides were beans, corn a roll and salad. The steak looked good until we cut into it...man was it DRY and COLD! I love a good steak but I could barely cut into it much less eat it. I was so hungry I managed to eat 1/2 of it before I was so tired of chewing this tasteless piece of meat. What also wasn't good was that we couldn't get more sides so we were both hungry and after paying $70 each it was very disappointing.   One good thing was the great view from the restaurant!!",

Couldn't get drink refills, the waiter's attention . . .nothing.  After an hour, he told us 3 or 4 times it was almost ready.  He kept telling us he \"had our back\".  Why do you need your waiter to have your back in a restaurant?  Were we competing for food/service??  Our table was never bussed between courses - I flagged down a busser to take away our salad plates,  dinner plates and bring more water. Evidently, the kitchen can't handle a dining room full of large parties.  Don't book them is you can't manage their orders without the rest of your guest's meals suffering. Thank goodness for the balloon guy and the magician coming by to entertain our 10, 11  and 13 year old.  Salad was iceberg lettuce swimming in ranch dressing w/ bad croutons.  Prime rib was served rare (ordered medium), baked potato (cold) was extra $$, all meals came with 3 cups of overcooked, flavorless sliced carrots.  Corn on the cob was frozen, baked beans were vinegar and ketchup out of a can.  Fried shrimp was cold and had way too much breading.  Fried zucchini served in a tortilla bowl?  Why?  Never offered dessert but brought cotton candy.  Waiter took the automatic gratuity off the check . . .before I told him too.  Our table was in a far corner of the restaurant away from the dance floor (good) but we all had to use the light from our phones to order and eat.  So dark we couldn't even see what we were served.    I'll call the restaurant directly tomorrow and speak to a manger.  Yes, it was that bad.",

Looking back at the reviews, we aren't the only ones complaining about food being served cold! Then the manager came up and asked to replace our meals, after we've waited for our original order. Really?! So he decides to give us complimentary dessert which was a GIANT slice of chocolate cake- ridiculous! They served us bread that could feed an army, which was hardly touched. So wasteful!

On the way to the Rooste I pulled up my Yelp app and perused through some pics. If you have never been here before I can safely say that the Rustler's Rooste not only live up to but exceeded my expectations of the pictures online.  Here are some highlights: *There is a massive longhorn in front of the rooste. You can smell it from the parking lot. *The slide down to the lower level is worth taking. The slide is short and fast (that's what she said) *Views from the outside are spectacular! Definietely a great venue for large parties. *The live music is a nice touch especially for the line dancing. *Staff was fast and friendly.  Overall I'm glad I was able to \"experience\" Rustler's Rooste. Although the banquet style steaks were a bit tough and the fried rattlesnake was a bit weird, the rooste was a fun time. I'm not sure how I'd like this place if I wasn't in a large group but for the setting it was fun. If the food was better I'd consider giving the rooste 4 stars but at least it earned a solid 3.",

Waitress was very friendly and attentive, double barrel margaritas (~$10) were well made and had a good balance of acid, sweet, and booze. We tried the rattlesnake because it seemed like the cool thing to do. The taste and texture was similar to frog legs mixed with chicken. It was fried which pretty much makes any protein taste the same. The accompanying fried mushrooms were tasty.   Pretty much our whole table got the bone-in ribeye (~$26 IIRC). The steaks were cooked to the right temperature, but were not seasoned well. The meat was good quality, however a little salt and pepper before grilling would have gone a long ways.   The strangest thing was \"VIP\" parking where someone directs you to a parking space and indicates that they work on tips. Not a valet, just someone pointing you to a spot and telling you that they expect a tip.   Overall I wasn't too impressed and have no plans to return.",

    "text": "I was pretty disappointed in my steak from here. I got the prime rib and it was not what you would expect from a steakhouse. The bread was good. The salad was good. So they give you a lot of food, but my steak was sub-par and the sides (carrots and corn) that came with it were nothing exceptional. The rattlesnake was a very small portion with more cactus fries than rattlesnake. I was disappointed from the last time we stopped here because we thought it was excellent.",

    "text": "My friend wanted to go here for her birthday, so we did.  There were three of us.  One gal ordered the fried chicken.  When it came, it seemed like two half chickens fried. I'm not sure if that's what it actually was, but it took over the entire plate.  She said it was good and moist.  My friend ordered the sirloin steak, and I ordered the filet.  The only sides that come with the meals are carrots and a small ear of corn.  I asked that no butter be on the carrots or the corn.  When my steak arrived, it sat alone on a very large plate.  Carrots and corn are already in butter and cannot come without, so I got nothing to go with the steak.  I asked if I could substitute something--\"NO\" was the response.  OK....I ate the steak alone.  It was good and cooked the way I requested.  A family style salad is served before the meal and a small bowl of beans (family style) is served with the meal.  If there is a birthday to celebrate, for $15 the birthday person can get a cowboy hat, bandana, cake and the band will sing Happy Birthday.  We had a birthday to celebrate, but didn't want all of that stuff (nor did we want to pay $15).  The waitress DID bring a large can filled with cotton candy and a lit candle on top.  It was a nice and different touch.  This place really is for tourists.  I've been there and don't need to go back.",

There's a bull out front in a small pen that looks pathetic and smells like poop. Let the poor thing live a better life somewhere else! After the 45 degree hike up to the hostess station we were greeted with silence and staring. We initiated an introduction with Hi!!! They silently asked, \"just you two?\"  Then another exploration up and down stairs and slides and weaving in and out of 43 kids to our table it was almost impossible to squeeze into the seats. And we're not big people. The menu was still all gimicky from the 80s in a newspaper style that was hard to understand. The live band was loud and terrible. We left before our server came. Horrible experience.",

    "text": "One of my fondest memories of growing up is eating at restaurants on my birthday. It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle.   My twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the \"good old days\" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.  Rustler's Rooste was suggested and it is True - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.    But!  You also get a cowboy hat.  I have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).  As for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.  For the meal, I had the \"catch of the day\" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband's steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.    But this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating?   Probably not.  But I will give it a few points for having such large, curly horns.",

    "text": "We visited on a Sunday evening for dinner. I had read the reviews and I thought let's try it.  The view in the early evening was quite nice and since we got there early we had a drink by the windows and enjoyed the view as the light from the day began to fade it was a great experience. It would have been awesome if we could have sat on the patio all night but there was private party down there.. Darn. The people looked to be having a great time down there and it was decorated festively and the grub was looking good :) The way the tables are arranged inside allows everyone to have a wonderful view and that's how it should be.  Ok, the restaurant is a steakhouse so for non meat eaters the selection is sparse but I found cheese enchiladas that are a side dish and you get salad and rolls served family style. We ordered the dressing on the side as others have suggested.  My other half splurged on the porterhouse steak (he was dying for!) and when it arrived it was cooked as ordered. No complaints from his side of the table, lol. My side dish was 2 small enchiladas, so if you are a bit more hungry order 3. They were all right . I will try the veggie burger with veg chili next time. Dessert? Wowsa! I ordered an eclair since it was for my birthday and that guy is HUGE!  We cut into it  for about \"small\" size servings and still had almost all of it on the plate! Order when you have a large party or eaters. Great part is you can take it home. There is a band that plays at 6 p.m. and they were pretty good  There's a small dance floor that some people chose to use.  Mostly Mom's and kids and the occasional couple.  The music is County and on the mellow side , not too wild, not too loud, so I suspect that's to let you enjoy your meal leisurely.  Cotton Candy.. last had this when I was a teen so we both decided to try it and it was better than we thought it would be when it was delivered when we finished our meal. Not sticky sweet like we both remember. I was surprised.  This is a place to celebrate an event, take visitors to  and of course enjoy the view with  company you enjoy. Don't forget to visit Horney the Bull outside.",

He told us the steak would be a little cold and walked away as my fiance and I were trying to tell him that the sides were cold too. We ended up sending both our meals back. The waitress  brought the bill and I told her we wouldn't be paying for that food. The manager came back and tried to tell us that we were responsible for the bill because the food never made it back to the chef. I explained to him that we gave both meals back and that it wasn't our problem that the waitress didn't give them to the chef. The manager said \"ok whatever\" and walked off again.  Very unprofessional.   We will never go back to this steakhouse.",

At $23 for steak you are better off going to ponderosa / sizzler / etc and saving $10 per meal for better food. Another alternative is paying an extra $10 and go to Steak44 or Donovan's - you will pay more but get a fantastic meal.   Ordered the rattlesnake and cactus fries appetizer. All fries and very little snake. NY strip was thick bland and poor quality meat. Beans were made to hold bricks and not for consumption. All Other sides were bad. I would like to make myself throw up - I feel the food polluted my body.   This place makes its living because of proximity to Arizona Grand and nice view overlooking town.

    "text": "We went on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. So the hour wait was not at all a problem. We got drinks at the bar & wondered around to explore the place. We really wanted to try this place for my birthday. We were not disappointed. Even though it was super busy the waiters and staff took their time to ensure you felt focused on vs rushed. Everything came out super quick! Mark & Kevin our waiters were very nice & personable. The vibe is very laid back yet you can get a little dressy if you wanted. I'm from MN & cabins were a big thing growing up. I felt very much at home! Slide indoors for kids is a smart idea!!! Balloon guy and magician also? Heck yes! We were like kids again and loved every min of it. The food was AMAZING!!!! we had the rattle snake, grilled chicken, & endless beef ribs. We will definitely come back. I already text my family and friends bragging about this place! My fiance & I are very impressed.",

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, and the veggies and beans were good. A bit expensive for what you get, but I guess you pay for the experience.  The negative though is that when we went outside to see the view after the meal, there were several employees outside smoking right next to us. I realize its not illegal or anything, and people smoke, but they could see that we were not liking it, and did not offer to move, or relocate to the other side where they would not be in customer view.  Sort of tacky I think, but that really is the only negative I noticed while there. Maybe next time will be better. We still definitely plan on returning.",

The appetizers were fine, $20 to try rattlesnake and cactus that was over-breaded and then deep fried....and that was the highlight of the meal!  Then there was the dinner. There was seven of us so we ordered a variety of items off of the menu.  Steaks were chewy and lacked flavor, burgers were blah, fries were soggy, and the corn and carrots were like what I used to get in the school cafeteria!  Our biscuits were literally rock hard, the rice had an awful taste and the swordfish was dry and tasted fishy. I suppose they have a great gimmick going and don't necessarily need to have good food to keep people coming in. Maybe I'm just too much of a city slicker to appreciate this cuisine!   I could only imagine what sort of business they could do at a location with so much potential!",

They were packed-- waited an hour--  still not seated-- we left and figured we would try again in the future.    The future was last night!  made a reservation for 6:30.  Got there at 6:20, no valet parking and very tight parking spots, but we made it in.  Go the front desk and they had a difficult time finding the reservation in their system even though they had texted us during the day to confirm. No biggie, the found it.  They then told us it would be 15-20 minutes until table was ready--  We were like cool---  even though we had reservation, 15-20 minutes was not a big deal.  At 6:55 we were still standing there and the kids were getting fussy so we asked again seeing as it had been 25 minutes...  They said it will be about 30 more minutes.  I am shocked!  Why have a reservation to wait an hour?  We left and will never go back.  Good luck, I can't comment on the food as I have never once been able to try it!",

Very cool setting, gorgeous view and looked to be promising but the food was pretty disappointing.  My girlfriend ordered fried chicken, which even though was plentiful, was also terribly over cooked and dry. I ordered a sirloin that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't like. I don't know if I've ever had a rare steak with so little flavor ever before. I expected so much more from a place such as this.   I brought up our displeasure and management gave us 1/2 off on our bill. I was ok with that at first but in hindsight it was hardly good enough and I feel it was quickly offered in order to diffuse any arguments in a very busy dining room.  I don't see us going back again.",

They serve rattle snake and sell shirts saying you ate the snake. Between that the live band and the slide inside I'd say thats the draw to it. Overall pretty dark in there and loud kids kinda run free all over but its one of those places everyone goes to at least once. Alot of people don't care for the pen beside the front door but we thought it was neat.  If you are looking for a typical steakhouse this probably isn't the place. The service was good but can be a little slow, seems hard on the servers just because of how the place is laid out they are walking miles all shift. I'd say It's not them it's the building.",

There is a pretty sweet slide that takes you down into the main dining area, live music in the evening, and beautiful views of the valley. So, the ambiance is fun.  Negatives: In my opinion, the food is NOT worth the price. First of all, you have to pay extra for sides like baked potato. This kind of a side is typically included at most steakhouses. They do serve bread which is super yummy. However,  the salad is a bagged salad,  not at all fresh and tastes horrible. I ordered the prime rib, I liked the seasoning but it was not medium rare as ordered. Like my vegetables, it was overcooked.  The veggies were not fresh and again, overcooked. When you pay$20 for a plate, you expect much more. Our waitress was inattentive and disappeared for a significant amount of time. There is a magician that comes around to the tables which I find annoying and uncomfortable.  I never carry cash, so I just sat there hoping he would skip us which he did.  As he passed by I got a huge whiff of cologne...nothing goes together like Old Spice and steak.    I will say that my son enjoyed the fried chicken and my husband liked his enchilada and steak plate.  However,  we could have had better food for less at Outback. Bottom Line: you are paying for the experience, not the food. Fun to do once, but $75 was a hefty price tag for subpar food. But hey... you do get cotton candy at the end of your meal,  so that's a plus!",

We would have been better off in three neighboring booths.  The slide was fun, the views are fantastic. The band was great, although they stopped playing before we were done dining. Very bland steaks and the pepper container wouldn't work. For the prices of the steaks , they should have had a pepper mill. I know I am not the only one who found those steaks bland. Diner beware.",

There was 10 of us and only 2 people ate their food somehow we still had to pay almost 400 tab. Don't get me started on the tab. One couple split their food off and the server took their payment and still tried to make the rest of the group pay that tab. Luckily I took pictures of tabs, server ripped them off the table before we even had a chance to calculate. He stood over my shoulder while waiting for me to sign. When brought to the managers attention he told us the server has been with them for 10+ years. Nothing was done. No one but the 2 touched their food. Now my husband has food poisoning from spoiled steak. Also there's 3 extra charges on my account. We will not be returning.",

Other meat dishes also look good and portions seem adequate. Though, that \"rattlesnake\" appetizer for $18.95 seemed light on the rattlesnake and heavy on the cactus fries. (But I haven't exactly been pricing \"rattlesnake by the pound\" so what do I really know?) Anyway, I have tasted rattlesnake! Tastes like chicken? Nope. Calamari! The rubbery type. Had I not myself seen an intact snake skeleton on a recent hike, I'd not have known that the spiny fried thing on the plate was the bones. (Um, don't eat that.)   Most entrees come with sweet potato chunks (pretty sweet but delicious) and corn on the cob. Be sure n visit the other options available like: Jalapeno mac n cheese, baked potato, vegetables n so forth.   You may just have room for the cotton candy and another bourbon at the end of the meal!",

Moved my family out here a month later.  Fast forward to May 5th, 2018.  I made early reservations as we were bringing another couple and the wife was celebrating her birthday.  When making the reservation, I opted for an add on birthday surprise for my friend.  Hat, cake and staff singing to her.  The service was horrible, the food was worse and to top it off, there was no mention of the birthday. Large salad placed on our table when appetIzers were half finished.  When we began our salad, our entrees were brought out and placed on a waiters table next to us.  The $28 bone in ribeye I ordered was tough as shoe leather, full of gristle and barely above room temperature.  The filets that were ordered were as bad.  My wife's 8 oz was raw in the center and temperature was almost cool.  I can only imagine how long those steaks sat in the kitchen before being brought out.  While Rustler's Rooste was once a place I would bring out of town guests, it has become an overpriced restaurant with lousy service.  No, I didn't complain to mgmt.  They should know the quality and temperature of the food they serve.  They've obviously lost track.   No doubt this was my last visit.   Enter at your own risk.",

Floors and steps that creek and a (good) live country band AND a dance floor and the view is spectacular.  This place takes people by the bus loads - and have things arranged and prepared to push a lot of food.   Unfortunately, the food is not good. I've eaten food from a chuck wagon (literally!) that had more love and care - never mind flavor - than anything I ate today. The steak was supposed to be prime sirloin - but it was not even choice by any grading scale I've seen - very tough, connective tissue (not marbling) throughout. The carrots and corn on the cob were boiled to death - and a long, long time ago.  The mashed potatoes were good and loaded with garlic. The gravy was better than the baked beans but I wouldn't or either one again.   If you're looking for a relaxing place with loads of character and great views - this is a place for you. Just eat dinner before you come.",

We had great seats with views of Phoenix.  The service was good and so was the food.  The second time we went was a little over a week later.  It was our anniversary and we were anxious to try the steaks.  Again, the service was good.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  Our only wish was that they had been seasoned.   We ended up at a window seat with a group of 7 or 8 at the table next to us.  It was obvious they were in the area from out of town and on business.  How did we know?  Each one tried to talk over the other and we couldn't help hearing every conversation they had.  Obviously, we moved.  Rustler's Rooste is a unique place to visit.  We love the decor and the view.  We also liked going down the slide.  The first time we did and the second time a family had several kids that thought it was a toy to go over and over again.   Oh well, we would go back.",

This was not the case - I got prime steak and you have to get corn on the cob and beans on the side you can't even change that if you want, you can only add sides. It just did not taste good, I am very happy that they didn't charge me for my plate because I didn't like it. I would go back for the view, music and mango margaritas, not food!",

If you are looking for an interesting place, sure, come.  If you are looking g for a steakhouse and/or great service. Don't come.     I ordered their top sirloin, medium.  Below is the picture of my steak, from a center cut.  In my mind - Medium rare.   The waiter offered to replace it but by the time he got to me, i had eaten around the edges and didn't want to send it back.   Another gentleman (the manager) came over to offer to replace it and i told him that i didn't trust a chef in a steakhouse who couldn't could a steak medium.  He then told me it WAS medium which blew my mind.   First, even if it was which from the picture it wasn't.   You NEVER tell the customer he is wrong.  You suck it up and move on.  I told him if he really thought it was cooked medium, he needed to goto chef school.",

You get a different answer to every question depending on who you ask but then it always comes back to no, we cant do that. Food was bad, nothing I would expect at a steakhouse. Both steaks were overcooked!  We went there on a Thursday night as a treat to ourselves. Hadn't been there in years. We had our 2 yo with us since it was kids eat free, we thought it would be kid friendly. Saw that hh is only offered in the saloon upstairs so we decided to have a drink and app before going down to eat. The hostess let us know we could sit at any of the low top tables w/o a reserved sign or any hightop table. We chose a low top by the window because of our child. We sat there for awhile wondering if we had to go to the bar ourselves. Finally a lady comes up to us and says she was sorry and nobody wanted to come tell us but the table we were at was actually reserved. I guess if they have a red napkin it means reserved, the hostess was not aware either. So we ask where else we can sit. She says any of the high tops or at the bar. So I ask again to confirm that there is not a single low top table we can sit at with our 2yo?!? So since they can't accommodate us, we ask if we can get hh downstairs, no. They cannot do that, but we can grab our own drinks now and take them down with us, fine. So we get our drinks and take them to the table. Great view!! Skip ahead to ordering. Be prepared to pay extra if you are a meat and potatoes lover. All dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob. Both were gross! Table gets a dish of cowboy beans that look and taste like they are just a few beans mixed into tomato sauce. My husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot!! A side of any type of potato is an extra $2-5 and hopefully everyone at the table agrees on one because they are huge sides. He ordered his prime rib med-rare and I order the filet med- well. When they showed up, I would have ate his steak! Both were overcooked. Mine had no pink at all but thats fine to me but his was so tough looking for a prime rib and had a sliver of pink only in the middle. In any other moment he would have sent it back but since at this point it was such a bad experience, all we could do was laugh and so he sucked it up and ate it. To top it off, the waiter tried to sneak one by us and charge us for the child meal. When we pointed it out he says,\" oh oops I gave you the old copy\". Ya ok. We will NOT be going back to Rustlers Rooste!!",

Me on the other hand i like to let meat speak for itself.   The bad is the bathrooms. Think bus station in Deming that is probably cleaner.  Floor seemed like uneven in alot of the restaurant so elderly stay away.

The waitress wasn't as friendly as her cowboy hat and boots led me to believe she'd be, nor was she very attentive.  They were mostly able to accommodate my food allergies.  The rice has butter, the corn is pre-buttered and for whatever reason I wasn't able to sub fries for my rice, but whatever.  The steamed veggies I had were good, and obviously way healthier than fries anyway.  But this place earns its two stars based on the fun \"extras\": a slide that our kids loved, a kids menu that doubles as a hat that looks like bull horns, a guy that makes balloon animals, a band (that happened to play some of my fave Willie Nelson & Johnny Cash songs), and a spectacular view (really, all of this is where the money goes when you buy that $15 cheeseburger).  A few final words about the bull at the entrance: Really, the last thing I want to see before I eat a meal of beef is a sad, lonely bull lying in a little pen that stanks of bullshit.",

All the appetizers came out quickly and were delicious as usual, however, we waited close to 40 minutes for any other food to come to our table, and noticed that no one else seemed to be getting food either. When the food finally did come out we had: 2 cold steaks, 1 set of lukewarm ribs and congealed mac and cheese. That was half our table. The food was cold enough that I could feed it to the 10 month old straight away without cooling it down. We sent one steak back, and it still came back semi warm. When the manager came over to talk to us about it he did offer to take things back again, but at that point we were over it and wanted to have dinner as a family. He said he'd take the kids meals and 20% off the bill. Our bill came and he had taken a total of $20 off. Not much of a dent in a bill that was $280 anyway. It was so disappointing for a Father's Day dinner. On the positive, our waitress was nice and apologetic for the wait on food.",

    "text": "It has been several years since I've come here and it's still a mixed bag. Overall, our dining experience was okay. Not bad or awful, not great, more like: mmmmmeeh leaning slightly towards a frustrating okay. The waiter was friendly but we would go 10 - 15 minutes before seeing him again, although he didn't do a bad job and was knowledgeable of the menu and when we did see him he did a decent job. I remember having a sub-par steak before and after reading the recent reviews prior to ordering, I decided to order the prime rib on the waiters recommendation. It honestly was not that bad at all and was tender and flavorful. It's not world class mind you, but it's decent. The salad and other items that come with the meal are also just okay. The Indian Fry Bread however is superb. The star of the whole meal in fact. It comes with cinnamon butter and is really good. The reason however that I am giving two stars is because the meal took two hours when it should have taken one. Everything is so slow and with young kids, the slide lasts only so long. By the time the check finally came the kids were bouncing off the walls. The bill was a lot more expensive for an \"average\" quality meal at best and it kind of felt like a final stamp on the overall experience. I just wanted to get out of there at that point. Overall - I don't see myself ever going back, which is a shame because it could be so much better with a cool atmosphere.",

Second visit I took my parents when they were visiting, with my two kids. We got there twenty minutes before dinner was served and the staff was rude about not being able to sit until the dining area officially opened and made it known we were less than welcome in the bar area. We went back again last night just my husband and I. Terrible service again. Waited eight minutes for a greeting at our table, then saw our waitress once to order, when food was delivered, and then for our check. The steaks looked great, nice quality, but zero flavor. I was embarrassed to ask for steak sauce because in my opinion a good steak shouldn't need it. Bottom line is I would maybe go again in another year or so but just for a fun atmosphere.",

I know there are always unforseen obstacles a dinner crew faces at a restaurant but in Rustler's Rooste case things will happen such as a server dropping the food on a tray stand in front of the table without any word of what to do when it is clearly your food and then walking away. Almost every time I've been they forget someone's entree or side and the last time they outright forgot my entire table's salad. Basically you'll see your server about ten minutes and then be stuck to fend for yourself.",

    "text": "Touristy, gimmicky, and great for kids- but definitely worth a go to try rattlesnake!  Most enjoy their first time but wouldn't prefer to go again.  Firstly, you walk up to a stinky cow at the entrance... Not a great way to kick start an appetite if you ask me.  After holding my breath and being led to our table, there is a slide you can take down instead of a short flight off stairs.  So bring out the inner kid by sliding down (and later finishing with some free cotton candy dessert).  The view is pretty spectacular and we had the pleasure of dining come sunset.  Our pictures looked like they were already instagrammed with the way the lighting hit.  The food- worst free bread I think I've ever had, no fluffiness, no texture, hard and cold.  The rattlesnake was super chewy and honestly you get more crunchy fried batter than snake in each bite.  The presentation is awesome with the rib cage for sure.  I'm just wondering if they have someone out on then hill hunting them or what?  Definitely the closest I'd ever get to a snake by choice.  Anyways, I had the prime rib special which was pretty delicious and average.  The mashed potatoes and the jalapeno Mac and cheese though were definitely something to write about.  The Mac n cheese was a perfect balance of crunchiness and a little kick without being too cheesy or liquidy.  If you decide to order mushrooms on your steak, it's a huge portion so I'd recommend sharing one order amongst the group.  Finally, the cotton candy... Such melt in your mouth goodness.  It didn't melt or stick to your hands and it's spun perfectly so you can actually tear off layers.  I don't think I can ever go back to squished, prepackaged, overpriced ballpark cotton candy again...",

    "text": "Happy Hour Trickery! Be aware that the happy hour only applies to the \"Saloon\" area.  This is an area that has practically no view to the lovely outside surroundings.  I went thinking I could enjoy some discounted prices on food and drink while enjoying the sunset with my wife.  False.  Pick 1.  You can't have both. Beyond this trickery, the place is pretty cool.  The slide is fun, and it's neat to do some dancing by the live band.  The cotton candy is for dinner guests only, so they won't give you cotton candy if you enjoy the happy hour prices. The saloon area did have table shuffle board, which is fun. So I liked the experience, but I felt like the happy hour promotion was a bit of a bait-and-switch scam.  Also, I really did not like the tri-tip pieces slathered in red-hot spicy sauce.  The beef tasted like tough chunks of chuck roast, and the sauce tasted like burning.  That's it.  It was too spicy to know whether or not it tasted good.   The Philly cheese-steak sandwich and fries were bland.  Once we added salt to the meal, the flavor was dramatically improved.  The sweet potato fries were good (we got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer before we realized the sandwich would come with fries).   There was only one waitress serving the saloon area, so I had to go on several missions to get more water, find salt, and eventually pay my bill. The place is a mixed bag.  My advice would be to eat before you go, and then just enjoy the live music and the view of Phoenix from South Mountain.",

My girlfriend cannot climb stairs very well due to a disability & I was told she could wait downstairs, but would still need to come up once the table was called (?).    After being seated at 7:15, we ordered drinks & then food.  Their one and only localish beer (Grand Canyon) they were \"out of.\"  When my lady friend asked if green chile's could be put on the side for her burger the waitress said \" I guess so\" my girlfriend smiled and said that'd be great, the waitress said \"that wasn't funny\" and walked away (???).    The \"authentic Western band\" was playing that well known cowboy trail song \"The Theme From Dukes of Hazzard.\"  Yes, I'm not making this up.  A couple was then seated behind us and within 15 minutes had their food and were eating.  8:10pm our food arrived, a hamburger and a steak.  The couple seated long after us had already eaten their steaks and gone home.  The food was lukewarm and nothing memorable.  After dinner we placed cash with the bill and set it on the end of the table.  The waitress looked at, made eye contact with me, then kept walking.  5 minutes later, she did the same with my girlfriend, another 5 minutes and she did it for a 3rd time with me.    I normally tip 30% for decent service and 20% for bad.  But this time, I scooped up the tip, left the exact amount for the bill and we left, for the first time in years.  When you open the exit door the lovely smell of fresh cow dung wafts into your nose from the steer they have in a pen nearby for the tourists to do... whatever they do with cows.  There are 20 better steak places I can think of off the top of my head in Phoenix.  If you want an \"authentic\" Western experience, well...try Rawhide in Phoenix or Triple C Chuckwagon in Tucson.  The West from TV is gone and never really existed but you'll have a better time, service, and food at either one than this place.",

I heard that the restaurant had a great view of the valley and was ideal for sunsets.  I finally got to go recently and I was kind of disappointed.  First, parking was strange.  The restaurant is on a hill and there was limited parking at the top near the restaurant and so there's additional parking down the hill, which you either trek up/down by foot or take a shuttle.  Second, I was expecting a romantic atmosphere but there were kids running around every where and even a slide for them inside.  Third, the food was expensive and not that great.  The food reminded me of the food you get at a buffet.  The place felt mainly like a  tourist attraction and is something you only do once. However, the view was nice, the restaurant had an old west feel with a live band and they give you free cotton candy at the end of your meal.",

Rustler's Rooste is THEE place to take out of town guests who need a little wild, wild west.  After attending the last Elite event, I came back a week later for the full Rustler's Rooste experience outside of the hosted event. It was a Wednesday and the place was filled with energy; the tables surrounding the band and dance floor were full of European visitors.  The sun started to set over the Valley as we enjoyed the best fried mushrooms the valley has to offer. The view from the restaurant is unbeatable. Atmosphere and view (and FRIENDLY service) is what gives Rustler's Rooste its 5 stars.  However, the fun truly begin when our dinner arrived. Yes, the Filet Mignon was great, but watching the foreigners learn to line dance was priceless. As we dined and watched, I couldn't help but think about the 'Arizona' experiences these visitors were having - and how something so simple to us very well could be the highlight of their U.S. adventure! Some even had dressed for the occasion with bandannas and cowboy hats. Adorable. As the beer and wine kept flowing the visitors got more brave and started dancing their own mixed version of the 2-step. What a spectacle!  The food fits the atmosphere. It's not fine dining with foams and porcini dust - but - considering the old barn feel, sawdust on the floor, music/band, slide, bull at the entrance (p.s. I also love the new cotton candy in a tomato can touch) I'd say yes - rattlesnake does taste like chicken.  Forget the out of town guests, I'm comin' back when I need a swift reminder of what the wild, wild west means to me!",

I walk in the doors and I'm immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams \"take the slide you coward!!\" OK, what the hay right? After I've recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers.   You have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler's Rooste.   Rustler's Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you're in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I've been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it's endless hours of childhood fun.   The food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you're really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics.   I've been to several events at Rustler's Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It's a romantic must.   As if the night couldn't possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler's Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the True southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler's Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler's Rooste!",

We got our table for nine people right away, despite it being Saturday night.  The place was pretty crowded and noisy but that is the kind of place it is with a country western band and lots of kids.  Our group consisted of four adults and five kids ranging in age from 6 to 11 and they had a ball on the slide next to the entry staircase and chasing around outside on the patio.  The view of Phoenix at night from the patio is really nice.  They have a kids menu and our bunch had a variety of food with no complaints.  Same with the adults who mostly ordered steaks.  The steaks were done to order and for the price were very good.  The family style salad and bread baskets worked out just fine for our rowdy group.  Our server was quite busy but made sure we had refills on drinks and anything else we requested.  Rustler's Rooste is a great place to take out of town guests with kids for a fun time.  Very kid friendly.  Just don't expect to have a nice quiet dinner and also don't expect a \"Morton's\" grade of steak at Rustler's Rooste prices.",

    "text": "My wife has never been here before so I figured it was about time.  Every Phoenician should go here at least once.  So, last Friday night as a monsoon was \"supposed\" to roll in, we decided to pay the Rooste a visit.  The parking lot at the top was full so we parked at the bottom.  I wouldn't have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe \"saloon\" doesn't do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.  The place was pretty packed but we didn't mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style.   Our waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don't understand why places can't hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.  I love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn't get much better than that.  My wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.  I know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don't like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don't come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.  Anyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.  Kids also seem to love the balloon animals, magic, the slide, and the little paper bull horn hats they give them.  Also, when you go, I would recommend sharing your entree.  The amount of meat they give you is more than enough for 2 people.   Although a monsoon didn't end up rolling in which would have been nice to watch up there, we had a good time anyway.",

Our server was the best art of our experience. He was efficient with a good sense of humor. As first timers he explained the menu and asked f there were any questions. Bread and butter arrived quickly. Ou orders were promptly taken. So- so iceberg lettuce salad appeared shortly there after.   There was one order for Prime Rib medium rare and five orders for various steaks. The meal came with green beans and corn on the cob. There were two orders for baked potatoes.    The food came in a timely manner. The Primr Rib came medium well, was dry with little or no flavor. All of the steaks were over cooked. All of the food was Luke warm at best. We came to the conclusion that ths is a VERY LARGE restaurant; and it is difficult to individualize orders. We are not likely to return to this restaurant. The view, the magician and server were the best parts of our dinner and not the food.",

The view is amazing, the staff is great, the slide is super fun, and an all around great time.   I have been here several times in my 25 year stay in AZ and always new memories. Many times as a kid with the folks, you know I went down that slide like a million times.... dad made me get off cuz it was time to eat. Dang it! Then in more recent years I have been for some work functions. They have a great patio that holds like 500 people or something like that. We had a charity event with dancing, food, bar, auction and mingling.... went off without a hitch. I would defiantly recommend this place for any corp or work function you might have. Book it early though, they fill up fast!   Outside the main restaurant they have a great view of the city on their huge patio with a great fireplace. I will be back for sure when it gets cooler outside. You should too! and don't forget your boots for some boot scootin and boogie-in!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I wish there was an option for  a 1/4 star rating. Went here with another family during our \"stay-cation\" at a nearby resort. It was HORRIBLE! First, you can't miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That's fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn't have to work for it since it's mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn't even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there's a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party's dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn't very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said \"it happens\". SPEECHLESS! At least he was consistent with the rest of the night.  We had better service, treatment, and food from McDonald's the next day.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I wanted this to be a great restaurant....I really did.  However, contrary to my wishes, Rustler's Roost was a grand ole disappointment.  The bull on the way in was probably the best part of the whole experience, though he did look slightly mortified to be seen in such an establishment.  First off, the place is huge and filllllled with kids, which I was willing to accept.  We sit down and immediately order beers and snake.  The snake comes out ASAP, but instead of reveling in a new tasty delicacy, I am confronted with some room temperature, chewy pieces of a once noble creature.  Oh well.  Then some fry bread, biscuits and salad.  The butter was odd tasting (the reg one, not the cinnamon one), the biscuits were incredibly dry and tasteless (how the hell did they manage to pull that off?) and the fry bread had seen better days.   On to the meal...I ordered BBQ pork ribs.  I took my first bite, and bingo!!!!!!!!  I got a prize.  I reached into my mouth, to extract it from my teeth, and I pulled out a lovely blonde hair (I happen to be of the brunette persuasion).   That was the straw (hair) that broke the camel's back.  We immediately called for the bill and told her to remove our entrees, which she did.  Then, the icing on the cake...the dude busing the table had the balls to say to us...:Better luck next time\".  I called him a douche bag, and went on my merry way.  The only thing this placed rustled up was my disdain and a bad yelp review.",

They had a live band which was nice but also made it hard to hear each other at the table.  All 4 of us had \"a little of this, a little of that\" which was 2 fillet medallions plus your choice of shrimp, swordfish or 1/2 rack of pork ribs.  Between the 4 of us we had every combination.  The meat comes with corn on the cob and either rice pilaf or green beans depending on your add-on meat choice.  Baked potatoes are extra $2.  Salad is included with the meal, but no choices of dressing.  It came pre-tossed with a ranch dressing.  It wasn't very good.  They bring baskets of rolls and biscuits.  They were ok, not nearly as god as Texas Roadhouse.  Our entrees were good and the view was beautiful.  The ambience was very nice other than being a little loud and we would definitely go back again.  We each had 2 beers and our total bill was $150 for 4 people.",

The bull outside was cool- it was unfortunate that he was housed next to the front door so as you are walking in to enjoy dinner- you smell bull excrement....not very appetizing if you ask me. The staff seemed a little dull- the hostess was some bored twit curling her hair with her fingers and chewing gum. The waiter was a total ass. He was rude and seemed like he didn't give a shit about his job. The view from the dining room and balcony is pretty amazing-you can see the lights of the city and it looks amazing in the dark. One thing that was not so great in the dark was our table! We sat over looking the huge balcony and view of the city but the are of the dining room we were in was dark. Our table didn't have a light over it so we had to use the light of the oil lamp on the table to read our menus- lame-o! As for food- We got the Cowboy thing where you get a little of just about everything on their menu- its for 2 or more people @ $21.95 per person- a pretty good deal for what you get- there were 3 of us and we all left with our tummies satisfied :)",

Imagine my surprise when everything was delicious! From the fry bread and biscuits brought before the meal to the well seasoned veggies and the excellent steak! I had the filet and my boys had the porter house and a sirloin cut. Everyone enjoyed their meal!   They fell short in  few areas. The side of sauteed mushrooms I ordered were not good. They were not seasoned at all. I sent them back. The potato skins we had ordered for apps never showed up. We asked about them and when they showed up they had green onions on them we had asked to be left off. Also, they had wandering balloon sculptors and card trick magicians going from table to table working for tips. It was kind of irritating when they didn't take the hint we were not interested in them coming to our table.   All in all a solid experience though really. Better than I had expected :)",

We were escorted to a table near the server's desk to the far back of the restaurant.  In order to view the menu we needed to use our phone flashlights.  We had some younger ones in our group but they could not read the menus either, it was soooo dark in there.  Five of us ordered the cowboy platter.  It is $26/person.  They delivered a bowl of buns that tasted like they came from a bag, just reheated.  The salad came in a shared bowl with soggy lettuce and few fresh tomatoes.   One person in our group found a very long hair in his salad as he was eating.  That shut down our salad appetite.  Cowboy platter was served on one cookie sheet that we all had to reach from.  We received 5 plates to use for our platter, but 2 of the plates had larger chunks of leftover food on them and hadn't been cleaned properly.  Maybe more of them were dirty but it was so dark it was hard to tell.  The plates were replaced but it took excessively long for fresh plates to be delivered so the rest of us were ready to eat but 2 people were still waiting for clean plates.  Steak tips were extremely small and flavorless.  They looked almost boiled rather than grilled.   We only received 4 pieces of shrimp even though 5 of us ordered the platter.  The seafood skewers were very overcooked and dry.  Chicken was also dry and flavorless.  Ribs were large but very fatty and not much flavor either.  All in all the food was extremely disappointing.  I wish I could say that one thing was excellent but there wasn't anything that we ordered that I would ever eat again.   The setting of the restaurant  was unique but our group will never go back because of the quality of the food.  It was one of the worst food experiences that I have had.",

It wouldn't be like that if they'd put the dressing on the side or put the dressing on right before they serve it.  The carrots are overcooked.  I had the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye.  Their seasoning is lacking and the steak was bland.    This is a great place if you've got kids since their kids menu looked good plus they serve complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  It's good for a drinking crowd and tourists too, just stay away from the steaks.  You'll have spent your money more wisely and with better food at Texas Roadhouse.  They have call ahead seating.  This place gets a lot of people going through there, so you'd think the food would be awesome, but it's far from it.  I had such high hopes.",

    "text": "I ate here 2 weeks ago. We were a party of 9 so we called ahead to make a reservation. They asked what % we wanted to tip our server which I thought was odd since we didn't know what we were going to eat or what type of service we were going to have. However our waitress was super sweet and helpful. She knew the menu and made suggestions which helped since 6 people in our party had never been there before. We got to the end of dinner and I knew the cotton candy would be coming and the kids were really excited. Well the machine broke earlier so we didn't get any. We asked the waitress if we could possibly get ice cream instead. The manager came over at that time. Wow. What an ass he is. He made 2 of the kids cry. Said no to giving us ice cream and then compared the cotton candy to the free mints you get after your meal at other restaurants. What a joke. But it was more his tone and body language that ruined our experience. I understand things happen but there is no need to be a complete asshole. Needless to say I used to love bringing my friends and family there but I will never go back. There is no excuse for an adult in the service industry as management to act like that.",

The cinnamon butter was a nice touch to it. Next came the salad and the salad was awesome. They have a home ranch that is awesome. I ordered the New York strip and it was the driest most disgusting steak I've ever had. We had 5 others that ordered the same thing and 4 felt the same way. There was no seasoning so we drenched it in A1. The reason it's not a one star is because the waiter and service was very good. The experience inside is fun as well. It's children friendly and even has a slide inside to entertain them.",

The food was good, meals come with delicious biscuits and cinnamon butter and a big salad for the table.  Our food was good and quick, and you get good value for your buck.  What really put the service over the top was that I forgot something on our table right before heading to the airport.

I have to admit that the manager did offer to replace our \"cold cuts\", cold corn, and cold sweet potato mix with warm food items like we had ordered...but who wants to wait for another set of 8 properly cooked dishes when we already OVERWAITED for them in the first place????? RR, I honestly don't know how you stay in business? Your saving graces are the views and the attentive wait staff. In my opinion, Mr. Manager gets a 0 or - star rating for his poor \"resolution\" - he acted like he didn't care that a party of 8 are spending $167 plus tip on a less than mediocre Christmas meal.

Meanwhile we went to the bar and waited in a 30 minute line for a $25 double vodka & soda. Insane pricing! The server wandered over and only took the orders of half of our table and walked away. Huh?!? We had to flag down another server to finish taking the orders. We were there two hours and still didn't have all of our food. She didn't bring three entrees and when I questioned her about it, she said we never ordered them. What?! When the bill came, we were charged for the food that never came out. Nice try. We told them to go back and take off some of the charges. They did. As we left, I handed the $400 in cash to the manager because I don't like to leave cash on the table. He asked how everything was and I told him it was terrible. Rather than apologize, he said it was our table's fault and we must have forgotten to order those entrees. When I told him he was wrong and that two of our entrees were actually cold and our server was extremely rude, he again said that it was our fault. I told him it was an awful experience and we will never be back. He said \"Ok have a good night.\" Condescending server AND manager. You'd be better off giving your business to Claim Jumper down the road. They are friendly and the food is good.",

Basically here is the warning, if you come here, you better come here with a Cowboy appetite! The portions you get are pretty good size (I didnt get it, but saw they have a 2 pound steak!) the service is real good, and prompt, they had a live (I guess its better then a dead group? LOL) Country Music group that I thought was pretty good. The only negative I can find with this place is that its a little dark inside, so had to have wife use her phone flashlight in order to get the pictures here. A huge plus in my books, is that they have Pepsi products, but this time went with a Beer, and it was the blonde beer from some brewery (I forget the name)",

    "text": "Delightfully Dissatisfied.  A tourist attraction at the very best.  Like many other Yelpers we showed up and saw that the parking lot was surprisingly full.  I drove to the front of the building to drop off my party.  A guy came to my truck and pointed to a few open spots very close to the front door and then told me he works off tips.  It was a valet your own car of sorts.   But I didnt want to park all the way down the hill so I gave the guy a few bucks after I parked my own car.    We walk up and yes there is a live steer roaming a stall right by the front door.  Hey kids this is where your steak comes from.   When you walk into the restaurant it is all about the wood beams and cowboy country decorations.  We were seated immediately  despite the overcrowded parking lot.   The view was absolutely the best part of the evening.  We arrived right at sunset and the view over the valley is great.  But that's where it ends.    The food is terrible.  I ordered a steak that was supposed to be a filet cooked to medium and it was just bad.  I've purchased better filet from the grocery store.  And then this is where it gets kind of weird.  They dont let you choose your sides.  all meals come with corn sweet potatoes and carrots.  first I dont care for those sides and even if I did the potatoes were mushy and gross and orange (sweet potatoes are orange) and I didnt touch the unappealing orange carrots  strictly from a visual point of view it was unappealing..orange potatoes, orange carrots and red steak (ordered medium got rare)  and then the taste was even worse than the look.  Its too bad because this place could be really really good but they have screwed it up and basically made it a cafeteria with a view.  I would be scared to see the kitchen because I can just imagine large vats of mushy sweet potatoes and carrots.  Everything tasted and looked as if it was prepared the day before.  It was just a shame because like I said earlier, This place could have been amazing.    And then there is the entertainment.  When we were dining a balloon animal guy interrupted us keeping in mind we were dining with two 14 year olds.  Last time I checked 14 year olds were not into balloon animals.  and then there was the magician.  he interrupted us twice before clearing the table to make room for a card trick.  OK i will give credit where credit is due.  The card trick was pretty cool.  But not in that environment.    Sorry Rooste I will not be coming back!  Oh and lastly it is really expensive for junk food.",

Dessert menu look awesome but I didn't have any room. 4 stars",

    "text": "The highlight was the prickly pear margarita. Pink and icy and yummy! The gals went with that while the guys opted for brews. The server was attentive and friendly. Once our table was ready, we headed downstairs to be seated viewing a wedding in progress. Okay....different but not bad. We started by tasting the rattlesnake (which comes combined with prickly pear fries). Hard to tell what you were eating. Deep fried and crunchy. Not bad. Can say we ate rattlesnake now (okay, four out of five of us did - one abstained). Then the actual food was ordered. We tried a variety - southern fried chicken, steak and ribs. The salad served family style with ranch dressing was, well, ordinary. The chicken was wonderfully crispy and (darn!) BLAND. BLAH. Each meal came with over cooked carrots and over cooked corn cob pieces and about half a cup of beans for all five of us. Oh, and biscuits and fry bread with a choice of plain or cinnamon butter. The ribs were voted the best choice, but only because they actually had flavor. My suggestion? If you want to experience this iconic place? Come and enjoy the bar and view from there. Then grab yourself a bucket of KFC (or your choice of takeout), drive up to a hillside with lawn chairs and REALLY enjoy the experience. Cuz, after dropping a couple of $100 bills, the best we can say is YAWN. Seriously, get a 'well seasoned' chef!!!",

    "text": "I wish I would have been in the mood for a place like this but I was tired and hungry and irritated that they didn't do take out.  However, I decided I'd go it alone (I was traveling for business), make my order, get a to go box and be on my way.  This is the kind of place you don't want to go it alone. Not because it's scary but because it is TOTALLY lame when you're alone.  I had no idea it would be so, hmmm, country and lively?    The building sits atop the city on a hill.  Would love to have seen it during the daylight as well.  And it's big! As soon as you get to the entrance you're greeted by a longhorn steer named Horney.  When you enter you climb your way into the restaurant through a wooden path that looks like an old mine.  Think amusement park ride.  Then when you get in it is BUSY! People everywhere. Floors are uneven. Loud, live music.  It would have been a 45 minute wait so I opted for a seat at the bar.  However, the woman who sat me didn't explain that if you sit at the bar you can only order appetizers. Well she was in luck because that's all I wanted, but it would have been nice to know that was my option!  I came for the rattlesnake bites and cactus fries, but ended up also ordering some wings because you only get about an ounce of meat with the rattlesnake bites.  The bartender, though busy, did find the time to take my order and tried to accommodate me. Looking around at the sea of bodies, I completely understood why he wasn't super attentive.  The food was ok. I just wanted to add another unique food to my list.  The rattlesnake was heavily breaded, chewy and kind of like chicken. Not much meat in those bites, though. The accompanying sauce...ick.  There were plenty of cactus fries and they reminded me of fried pickles.  The wings were delicious!  So glad I got those because I wasn't a big fan of the fries after the first few bites.    If I make it back to Phoenix, I might give it another go (but will try a steak or something else). Like I said, it's better with company.  If you're looking for a quick to go order on a business trip on a night where you're dead tired, I'd just avoid it.  It sounds like this place could be quite an adventure. From the website:  Rustler's Rooste has it all.  Our critter out front, an enormous long horn steer named Horney greets you upon arrival.  Open the door and enter part of an old mine shaft to the top floor to our Mountaintop Saloon.  Saunter over the indoor waterfall and take our Famous \"Tin\" Slide into the dining room. (for the faint of heart, there's a staircase).   Enjoy the live country western band and our strolling cardshark/magician.  The building is bordered on the north side by plate glass windows so there is a view form every seat in the house. Rustler's Rooste was founded in 1971 and is still family owned and operated.  The legend goes that the original site, atop a butte in the foothills of South Mountain, was a hideout for cattle rustlers.  Today it is firmly established as the valley's highest and brightest beacon of the total cowboy western experience.",

After about an hour we were seated, our waitress wasn't friendly but she wasn't mean either. She was just working, never asked us if we had been there before, if it was a special occasion or even mention her name, never even greeted us . Just asked to take our drink order. My husband had to stop her because we wanted an appetizer. Food was great! We didn't know that cotton candy was  complimentary until we walked out, because she never offered it to us. From looking at website I now know my husband and I could of taken pic for our Anniversary to be on their website. Maybe next time our visit will be superb.  We will be back.

Great view in the evening when the sun starts to set (if sitting outside or near the window). Free wifi for your pleasure but plenty of entertainment in store. Video games are present and shuffle board available to play. Indoor and outdoor settings. Two story Restaraunt with lots of fun.   First time at this location but Food was ok for my family tonight. I personally loved my half-a-rack ribs with carrots, jalapeno bacon Mac n cheese, with corn on the cob (definitely a must). It fell off all the bones and that's the greatest test for any ribs. That speaks volume in itself. Great flavor and epic BBQ sauce. Zucchini logs were really great as well. Had a taste of the Salmon and it was coked perfectly and tender but flavor needed a little work. Like it was missing some butter or lemon. It was still good to me. Big Burger was good. Coconut shrimp was a great size portion but seemed a little over cooked. Seasoning was perfect and brown rice was great.   Overall experience for me allowed me to give this location a 3-star for the live entertainment, fall-off-the-bone ribs, the outside view (location), and friendly hospitality.",

Nothing compared to the view at Compass Grill, which is pretty close to the same price. Goodness.

We have reservations  and we're promptly  seated we could see that they were extremely busy we were greeted and brought our drinks we decided to order an appetizer because we knew our dinner would take a long time unfortunately that's where everything went downhill the next time we saw the waitress was 30 minutes later after we received our appetizer. We ordered the combo shrimp & medallions , the swordfish the salmon and a sirloin steak it took another 30 to 40 minutes before dinner arrived the house vegetables were undercooked and nearly raw the corn on the cob was mushy and my $20 sirloin steak was so chewy it was completely unedible and flavorless. And then medallions and shrimp came only with the shrimps it had to be reordered to get the medallions. They were cooked properly but was also extremely chewy too seems  the best part of the experience was the cowboy chili beans and sopias and biscuits needless to say I don't think we shall be returning  But the waitress seemed to try to do her best so we did leave her the 20%tip it  seems very pricey and overrated only for the ambiance.",

The negative points include the quality of the steaks, the seating, and the service. The steaks were expensive, of poor quality, tough, and with poor taste. The seating was uncomfortable and cramped.

The restaurant does have an awesome view of the valley and my husband planned our reservation to take advantage of sunset.  My hamburger was good as were the ribs my mom ordered. However, my husbands filet was not cooked properly and cold when it came out, his mother's filet was over cooked and tasteless. Our salad was old, wilted and soupy. The bread basket was good as were the other sides.  The service was slow and we sat without refills on any drinks for excessive periods of time. The place was too busy and without proper staffing.

Certainly not for someone who is about to celebrate his 78th.  At first impression, the place is Chaotic and LOUD.  Did I mention that it is LOUD.  If you like your dinner with a side of Screeching Teenage Girls and sing a long Happy Birthday, then welcome home.  Of the 2 hours that we were there, about an hour and a half were spent listening to that musical, over and over again. My uncle was not amused! I was embarrassed that brought the family in to this spectacle.  What is ironic, is that the food wasn't actually bad at all. My medium rare filet was very tender and flavorful.  No one at the table complained about the food.  Unfortunately, the setting made you forget the nice meal.",

It seemed like a blackened piece of char but he tried it. He said it was hard to describe, but the absolute worst steak he's ever had. This place needs a new chef or something. The steak doesn't come with a baked potato, but it came with cut up carrots and corn on the cob. The carrots didn't look appetizing and I didn't see anyone who had finished them- what a waste. He ordered the baked potato at a charge but he shared it with me. They give you a huge salad that's drenched in a dressing- Italian maybe. Service was ok- our guy was nice. What I was very irritated by was the staff yelling Excuse Me! every time they needed to get by you. We were a group of 8 trying to make it to a point where we could grab a nice pic of the couple, and so as a group were trying to make our way thru this crowded place. I found it rude the way the girls usually would yell from behind us, Excuse me as they tried to get by. Of course, we moved aside after being yelled at. That is just poor taste from a service stand point. I don't get why this place could be so crowded, except for the view. It's overpriced and low quality. The guy did remove my hubby's steak dinner from the bill so that was good and we appreciated that. We did pay fifteen dollars for the baked potato and my side salad (our table had 18% gratuity added) but I was grateful to not have to pay for his entree.",

    "text": "Rustlers Rooste  On September 6, a group of my friends and I went out to eat at Rustlers Rooste. Rustlers Rooste is a restaurant that has an upbeat country theme. It is very rustic looking and gave me a good vibe when I walked in. Although, the seating and tables are very close together and hard to move around in the over all set up is very pleasing to the customers. Not only was it just a normal restaurant but also there was a band playing fun country music where people could country line dance on the dance floor. And there was a fun slide, for all ages. Last but not least the overall view of the restaurant was stunning. While my friends and I were eating we would look out the window and look out on the beautiful view of the city. There were many things going on it was definitely not a boring dinner!  Not only was the overall appearance of the restaurant stunning, but also the food was very delicious. I am a very picky eater but I decided to step outside my comfort zone and try something new. I decided to order rattlesnake. I was very nervous to try it but after I did I was very surprised.  It was breaded over and tasted nothing like I expected it to. It came out looking very presentable which made it more appealing to try. I think it was very well cooked and it almost tasted like chicken. I would recommend someone who has never tried rattlesnake to try it. Eating something so out of my comfort zone wasn't as bad of an experience as I thought it would be. One thing I did not like about Rustlers Rooste was that the costumer service lacked. Although, it was extremely busy on a Saturday night it was hard to get the waiters attention. I had to ask many times for a refill on my water and repeatedly ask for things. Not once did the waiter come ask me how my meal was or if I needed anything. And after waiting thirty minutes after I was done eating I had to find my waiter to ask for the check. But the waiter was still very kind and apologetic. Even though the costumer service did not meet my standards I would still go back. The overall experience was very fun and defiantly one to remember. I would recommend someone who has never been there to go there, not only for the entertainment but for the delicious food.",

The second night the place was packed, it took even longer to get our food, it was unbelievably hot inside BUT our waiter was great and the good was good.  The BEST things about this restaurant is that it is part of the Grand Arizona Resort which means they drive you from the resort to the restaurant and back and  you can charge food to your room.

Both of the kabobs were much better than the rest of the meal.  Even the garnish and cru de te was old.  The lettuce garnish was dried out crispy, the radishes were soft and mealy, and the celery was soft and bendable.  I would not recommend this dish at the end of the day.",

First of all, lets talk about the ambiance (because that is the reason you show up).  The view is spectacular.  The magician that shows up at the table is amusing and fun - kids love it.  Now the slide.  First time we showed up a year ago, my kids (4, 6 and 8) slid happily for an hour.  The second time there were new rules and a mean woman that yelled at my 30 pound daughter and made her cry (yes, I carried a child out of the rooste crying).    Food.  Well, its pretty bad - very fried.  The side salad and biscuit were decent.  Everything that followed was overpriced and nasty.  First of all, I had kids that didn't want the normal hot dog and chicken fingers kid's meal so I had to pay $3 for a meal share for each of them (really????).  The steak was not good.  The kid's spaghetti was sent back (and the butter noodles that replaced it were welcomed).  They couldn't bring us the check quick enough and we are done with our annual trip there.",

Between the rattlesnake appetizers, fried shrimp, bbq chicken and the many libations, we had good time.  The food was only mediocre, but the service was good and the tourist nature of the spot was entertaining.  One plus for the family folks is that kids...LOTS of kids are welcome.  There is a fenced-in bull when you walk in and a slide with lots of screaming kiddos.  The prices are a little steep for the quality but it is a tourist trap, so be prepared.",

Like it was sitting around for hours before serving  even the baked beans made canned super market beans seem gourmet . Dried out ribs, something that was supposed to be steak and seafood that was a war crime . Pass on this place and enjoy many of the other fine places in town. They clearly don't care",

    "text": "We were from out of town, and this was the best restaurant we hit all trip. The dining experience starts off with a quick hello to the huge cow outside the restaurant. Once inside, after checking in, you are guided to a slide you can go down to enter the downstairs/eating area of the restaurant. There's also stairs, but the slide was fun :) all the staff is dressed in cowboy attire, which is cool. We go an awesome table at the window with an awesome view. Our dinner started with a bang... 1. bread/butter: they brought it out, Indian fry bread (which is SOO yummy) and biscuits, which are also great. there's a normal butter and a delicious cinnamon butter, or honey to top it off with.  2. salad! it had a lot of dressing but it was good. served family style  3. THEN we ordered... among my whole family, we were able to try a lot of foods.. I got the grilled chicken and I loved it! bbq'd to perfection with great sauce. the corn was great, and my family was all very happy with their meals too (ribs, shrimp, etc). overall awesome food.  4. finally they brought out complimentary cotton candy! it was funny to get, and you can't go wrong with cotton candy.   just remember.. - Come early or make reservations! (We tried to go on a Monday night during spring break, around 6:15 pm and there was a 45 minute wait. We made reservations for Thursday at 5:30 and it wasn't crowded, but I'd still say reservations are a safe bet, or arrive early!) - Parking will likely be full in the upper lot, unless you want valet parking, the lower lot is good. there's a shuttle that goes up and down too, but it's a quick and easy walk too.  - It can be loud, if they have a band playing.   Quirks we loved: - the cow outside - the slide - the views - the Indian fry bread - cinnamon butter - the cotton candy   Overall it was an awesome experience and had super BBQ. Great family restaurant, fun time, amazing view... loved it all!",

Sounds bad but I was thankful for my Mom's disabled parking tag.   I do have to give it props for atmosphere (do people give props anymore?) the view is great, the drinks were tasty (long island iced tea) and the staff mostly attractive.   I ordered the prime rib, it has some fancy name for the size like \"ranch hand\" it was the 16 ouncer done medium well. It was done to perfection with the exception of the fact it was cold, visualize 16 oz slices of medium well prime rib sitting in a 90% oven waiting to be ordered.   The veggies were piping hot and the baked beans were tasty. My mom later claimed that her chicken wasn't very good and my Dad liked his steak OK, but nothing to go back for. Since it was my Aunts B-Day we all just went with the flow (she thought she was paying). BBQ? There wasn't a smokey flavor to anything other than the beans, my Dad's steak didn't have any \"BBQ\" flavor.   There was a \"good\" (is there good country music?) by good I mean talented, live country band that allowed a few very good guests to sing, while people scooted their boots, young and old. This was fun to watch.   For the price, I would expect much better food. But if you go, go to have a good time, around folks also having a good time and don't expect the best food ever. P.S. don't be a wuss, and take the slide down to the dining area.",

There was a live country band when we visited which was fun. The food is hit or miss, some of our steaks were cooked perfectly and others were overcooked. They serve a big bowl of iceberg lettuce salad family style with a tiny bit of dressing already on it. Mixed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) were served with our steaks as well as a small corn on the cob. Baked potatoes or fries are an extra charge. Skip dessert (especially the apple pie with the toughest crust you'll ever put your fork in).",

The bartender was super swamped, I felt bad for the guy. He was trying his hardest to keep up. They finally got him some help but it took 25 minutes to get our drinks. After that we went upstairs to the other bar and were completely ignored by the bartender and he definitely saw us.( the drinks were way over priced anyways! ) We finally got to our table. The waiter was nice and very attentive. The food was absolutely terrible. Ordered the all-you-can-eat beef back ribs but when they came out they were all fat and charcoal black. We were there a total of 3 hours almost    NOT worth the wait  NOT worth the price And definitely NOT worth the food.!!! Cool atmosphere but Won't go back",

There's a fair amount of kitsch here with the slide down to the main level and the over-the-top cowboy theme from the wait staff, decor, and even the menu, but that's what they're about!  The food is pretty good quality.  You get the salad, biscuits/fry bread, beans, and then your main dish.  I had the ribs/filet medallions and the medallions were pretty good.  The ribs were overcooked and the sauce was a little sweet.  My friend had the bone-in ribeye and it was cooked properly and had great taste!  I'll have to lean toward the steak next time.  Staff was really good about recommendations, having a great attitude, and clearing the table.  The cotton candy was a nice finish to give you a good attitude as you left.  Definitely a good place for out-of-towners!",

But I would prefer not to be greeted by the smell of cow pies when I walk by the entrance.   The decor was cool. Definitely felt like I was in a ranch style restaurant.   The food was OK. In my opinion it was a little overpriced for what you were actually getting. My steak was cooked perfectly - which I was really concerned about. The rattlesnake appetizer completely lacked any hint of flavor. The rest of the food was also OK. Nothing terrible, nothing great.   Overall there are definitely better places in Phoenix to eat. This place might be worth a try - but don't go into it expecting a lot.",

    "text": "Well let me see where do I start.....well I guess I will start with the view. The establishment sits near South Mountain here in phoenix and I must tell you the view is simply breathtaking. There is plenty of outdoor seating and that is a must do if you visit this place because again the view of the city and the surrounding mountains are not to be missed. My wife's company IKON office solutions hosted there annual party for the employees here and it was first class all the way. The gave away tons of prizes....check the photos I posted.....and everyone was so friendly.  This establishment is huge, which makes it great for hosting huge office parties like these. We had our own venue out back large enough to hold about 300 people or more and we still could move around. We didn't have to worry about disturbing other customers....because they were in the main dining hall of this establishment which is a throwback to the western days. There is live music and even an old school slide that you can ride down from the second level to the main eating level. There is also a huge steer out front as you come into the establishment....that's right a real life Texas steer....maybe not from Texas though....LOL.  Now as for the food....well they served us BBQ chicken and ribs and I must say the Chicken was great....didn't try the ribs however....sorry....but my wife liked them. There were also baked beans...while not great...were not bad either. They also served homemade biscuits....corn on the cob...and there was a great garden salad as well. There was an open bar  for everyone to enjoy.....and I must say again the service....atmosphere...staff....food presentation....and ambience of this establishment were top notch.  WARNING......WARNING.....WARNING....be advised that the parking here can be very bad. There is very limited parking on the \"Main Hill\" i will call it....right in front of the restaurant. There is plenty of parking \"Down Hill\"....which means you have to walk back up to reach the establishment....and trust me that is more than a notion folks. If your not in fairly good shape I recommend letting them valet park your car which is free....but tips are accepted....and you may have to wait awhile for you car when your ready to leave because they are pretty busy.  The other option is taking there shuttle bus....but you may be waiting for it as well. Since I am in pretty good shape I just walked back up the hill...but I would not advise that. Just wanted to put that out there because this city and state has a lot of elderly people and I would hate for them to come to this establishment and face this problem. So if your even in the mood for a little western adventure and great southwest cuisine visit rustler's Rooste and as always Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!",

They have a big longhorn steer in a corral near the front door, so the entrance smells like cow pies. Not appetizing!   We were seated right by a door that kids were shrieking in and out of, and the hostess refused our request to move to a nearby clean, empty table. The waiter was fine, but the food was completely disappointing -- nothing was seasoned. The salad and fry bread were OK, but the sauteed shrimp had not seen any salt, pepper, herbs, anything. They tasted boiled actually. it came with rice mixed with mushrooms, celery and green beans, no salt or flavor in that either. My colleague's bone-in rib-eye, ordered medium-rare, was chewy and bland. I guess we should have been on alert when the waiter placed the bottle of steak sauce on the table first. Why wouldn't they at least salt a nice steak?   Prices for their tasteless entrees were high, from $25 to $35. This place is awful. Even if you go expecting Western fun and music, you should at least get a great meal for the price. Not here.",

    "text": "Absolutely terrible. Terrible food, terrible service.  We went to the Rooste last September when we were staying at the Grand for my husband's birthday and were disappointed from the moment we walked in. We went to the hostess stand and stood there for 3 minutes (I timed it) before one of the four hostesses even looked up to acknowledge us. The girl that helped us acted like she was doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. It was a busy saturday night, so we had to wait a bit for a table. No problem, because we could grab a drink at the bar and then let our kids go down the slide a few hundred times.  We get to the table, order from a very nice but stressed out waitress. After much more endless sitting and waiting, and joking with the table next to us about the ridiculous wait, our food gets dropped off by a food runner. Not dropped off to our table, mind you, but the runner puts the tray of food on a stand nearby, and tells us that our waitress will be by to serve us momentarily. After more waiting, we served ourselves, ate, and put our dirty dishes back on the serving tray before our waitress came around to see us again. Glad we didn't wait to be served. The food was airline-quality. We both ordered the steak and enchiladas (a weird combo to offer but it sounded good at the time). I could have easily made something better at home. Maybe the point of having you wait for so long for your food is to make you starving enough to choke it down.  We were so over the whole experience by that point that we asked for the manager. What a mistake. Most managers in a customer service setting are cordial to the customers and care about their business. Not this guy. He stormed over to our table and practically yelled that they were very busy that night, and we should be more patient. We hadn't even explained our issue by that point. As my husband tried to explain the numerous issues that we had encountered from the rude hostesses down to the nonexistent waitress, the manager seemed to get angry with us and again told us to be more patient. To which my husband replied \"Are you f***ing kidding me?\" Well, that didn't sit well with the manager, who said he wouldn't even speak to us further if we were going to cuss at him. I took over and asked us how he would feel if he were in our shoes. How he expects to be treated at a restaurant, and what kind of service he expects when he dines out. He simply said that they were just too busy that night and there was nothing he could do to help us. We weren't asking for anything, we were just trying to make him aware of all of the issues that we had encountered so he and his staff could try to improve.  I've had poor service at other restaurants, but I've never had a restaurant manager act like such a jerk. It's no wonder that place has such bad reviews. It's terribly run, and the food is terrible. The only thing it has going for it is the slide and the view.  Don't waste your money.",

My daughter turned 35 yesterday and she asked to go there for her family birthday party.  There were six of us and we had a great time.  Were the steaks Flemings quality?  Nope.  Was the salad the best? Nope again.  But the place has one of the most drop dead good views in all of the valley, sawdust floors, a bull outside, and tons of awesome old west atmosphere.  There is even an awesome slide you can take from the upper level to the lower level.   I have been to this place 20 times or so and I am never disappointed.   People who go here expecting an amazing culinary experience are going to the wrong place.  One look around the Roost -- just being there puts me in a good mood!",

You need to come here hungry because you get a lot of food. They always Bring out salad, bread and biscuits before your meal. After you dinner they give you cotton candy!!!   Their prime rib is so good. You are able to choose which size you would like. They offer 4. If you are brave enough, you can have rattlesnake for a appetizer. I still haven't tried that yet.",

Food was mediocre.  View was outside amazing and the outside fire pit was neat to sit by.  The ambience of the restaurant was fun.

I had the BBQ chicken and hubby had fried chicken. First they delivered a family served salad that consisted of just iceberg lettuce that had bagged croutons on it with literally only 2 tomatoes and 2 cucumbers. Next a food runner delivered our food and it sat on a tray for several minutes with many staff passing by and not one of them served it. Our server, Amy, was nowhere to be found, in fact she was MIA for most of our dinner. We served our own dinner and then had to move the tray as well since they all continually walked by it and not 1 staff member moved it, ridiculous!! The food, was disgusting, bland had zero seasoning and the corn and carrots are definitely frozen. I had about 1/4 of my meal only to satisfy my hunger and when the busboy asked if we wanted it wrapped I said no, it was disgusting, he said sorry and that was it. My husband had 3 bites of his fried chicken (which is actually worse then the roasted chicken). The server finally returned to see if we wanted anything else, we said no, she offered to wrap hubby's dinner we said no, and stated it was terrible, then further stated everything was actually quite bad. She said sorry and that was it. Gave us a bill and disappeared. We had to go  to the host stand to actually pay the bill since she disappeared again.  Neither the busboy or server said anything to a mgr., but I found out why, mgmt. doesn't care either. The GM never apologized, never offered to remove anything from the bill, he only said he would be happy to make us a future reservation, I said no we would never return, he said in a snarky tone \"OK\" and then just walked away. Don't waste your hard earned money here, go somewhere else!!",

Only thing I would ding them on is the porterhouse is only 1.5 pounds at best and not 2 pounds, but its advertised as darn near 2 pounds. I have a BBQ vending business and compete in BBQ competitions and know quite a bit about meat. A 2 pound porterhouse needs to be close to 2 inches thick to be 2 pounds.  Mine was an inch. I can never finish a 2 pound porterhouse anyway so I gave 5 stars for the flavor and doing right. It was only $35.00.  Well worth it for a real mesquite grilled steak. I read other reviews and conclude that the poor reviews are competitors or people who know nothing about steak.",

Not sure when we might be back in the, area but will recommend and keep on our radar",

    "text": "Saturday night birthday party and this was the place to be! We were a party of 11 and we were more then ready to take on some good food!   Being my first time here, I was excited to see what the fuss was all about. We arrived at 6pm and there was no parking in the front of the entrance, so we decided to drive down to the extra parking spaces. We walked up a very steep steep hill and by the time we made it to the top, we were sweating! Ugh!   Walking towards the entrance you have to come across \"Horney the Bull,\" as he is right by the door to get in. I'm so sorry Horney but you stank!! You walk right on in and you then have to walk another steep hill to go up to where the hostess will tell you where to sit.   We were pointed to the direction and told where our party was at and so we made it right on over. \"Turn left, then right, then go down the stairs/slide, take a left then keep walking then you will see them on your right.\" We sat down and looked on over our menu. We were brought biscuits (these were as dry as some feet I've seen) and fried bread. (the fried bread was so hard I almost broke my tooth)   I decided to order the salmon that came with rice pilaf, a corn on the cob, and I got an extra side of mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of the potato skins and my mom decided to give the fried chicken a try. The food looked so delicious and I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, the food had NO FLAVOR. I became great friends with the salt and pepper that night.   Everything was flavorless. Why? Service was great as our waitress was very attentive. We were there at 6pm so we were able to see the sunset! Beautiful!   No entree here is less then $16 so keep that in mind. Portions are pretty big but again, the food has no flavor.. we received free cotton candy at the end of our meal!   Our bill came out to $70.84 for the salmon, potato skins, fried chicken, and two drinks. Come here for the cool cowboy experience, not for great food.",

They have a slide for the kids to go from the top level to the bottom level when being seated.  I was surprised how majorly busy it was for just a Wednesday.  People were coming in droves.  They also had a magician that was amazing and also a guy making balloons for the kids.  I had the 24 Oz. Judge prime rib.  Sometimes prime rib can be really fatty but this was probably the leanest prime rib I ever had.  Very good.  My only complaint is that it took forever to get our bill settled but other than that it was a super joint.  They also had live cowboy/country music and it wasn't too loud which is good.  I will definitely be back!",

First of all, the server cleared away all our bread baskets and bread plates before the entrees arrived. One minute I had a half-finished biscuit in front of me; the next minute, nothing. My 8-ounce fillet arrived grilled to perfection (medium rare) but was barely lukewarm on the outside. Fully half my plate was heaped with mushy sliced carrots. My corn on the cob (only half a piece) tasted as though it had been sitting in warm water for a couple of hours. The baked beans were hot but tasted suspiciously as though they'd come out of a can. I ordered (and paid extra for) a side of mashed potatoes; the gravy was missing, and the potatoes were nearly cold. A friend had potato wedges, which were rubbery, as if they'd been sitting in a pile under a heat lamp for a while.  On the way out, I passed by the longhorn steer in the corral. It was dark, but there was a bright spotlight shining on him as he stood there with his head hanging low. Shame on you!",

    "text": "The night started out with us arriving right at 6pm (our reservation time), and being stuck in line behind a few other families. The hostess had to keep alternating between talking to customers on the phone through her headset, and serving people in line. Maybe they were understaffed, but she looked like she was used to having to do both jobs at once, which really slowed down the line. Despite making a reservation and only getting to the hostess about 10 minutes later than our reservation time, we still had to wait for another 15 or so minutes, which I found rather unprofessional. However, aside from that, our service was great and experience memorable.   First, the food. Man, was there a lot of it. We got the rattlesnake and prickly pear appetizer. Probably because it's snake, but the meat was in super small pieces, and I felt like I was just eating a lot of breading that I didn't want. The pieces of meat that were bigger had a chewy texture that I quite liked. The prickly pear tasted strange, in my opinion, but I hear it's not for everybody.  For my entree, I ordered \"Some of this and some of that,\" which included 3 steak medallions (not very big, but definitely enough food) 3 large fried shrimp, corn on the cob, and rice. My steak was cooked perfectly, and the rice was delicious as well. The shrimp was overdone, and there was too much breading for my liking, however. I would recommend getting them grilled instead (or get another side altogether, I'm just partial to shrimp). In addition, we were served a house salad to share, a bowl of \"cowboy beans\" (which were delicious!), 4 pieces of frybread, and 2 biscuits. The frybread and biscuits came with an amazing cinnamon butter, which I highly recommend. We didn't realize that getting leftovers packed up was an option, so we left quite a bit of uneaten food, but we know now for next time! There's also complimentary cotton candy at the end of the night, but we were too full and didn't want any. It looked like some other tables really enjoyed it though!   Our table wasn't right next to any windows, but I could still enjoy the views from where I sat, which were spectacular. I also got to watch the family next to me celebrate the birthday of their 7 year old little girl. The guy who made her a balloon and chatted with them awhile seemed to really make her day, so that was also cute to see. There was also a live band, that we were seated pretty close to (which I was nervous about), but the volume was just right.   All in all, it was a good and memorable experience. But now that I've done it, I don't think I need to do it again.",

Sandy was our server and was super fun and engaging. However, when I sat down I asked her to please add the birthday package and gave her my friends name. After our meal the cotton candy came, but no song or anything :( Nobody at the table knew any different, but I was disappointed. That's the only thing holding me back from a 5 star review.

I'm taking off one star because they keep a bull right next to the entrance. The bull himself is majestic and beautiful and surprisingly tame and well-behaved. However, the inevitable smell of manure poop is a bit of a mood killer as you're walking in and then as you're leaving the restaurant.  I think retiring the bull to an animal sanctuary would be the best move here.",

When you first check in it is fun for the kids because they get to go down the slide which they loved. They wanted to keep going down it every 5 seconds once we sat down.   The food and service was just meh. I should have used my better judgement and chose to go somewhere else, but this was a super quick drive. We could have even walked from where we were staying.   I personally thought it was over priced for the quality of food you get. The portions and big and you do get a lot of food, but it wasn't worth it to me since I didn't love it.  I know my kids loved it, but only for the slide and the cotton candy which was great. I love cotton candy.",

Filling was good crust was like cardboard. Plate was so small everything overflowed. We were looking forward to a great dinner. What a let down",

The staff was all very friendly. Our waiter in particular, named Jacob (or Jake?) He was kinda quirky and fun. The food was great. Expect to spend a pretty penny on dinner but it is worth it. My boyfriend and I both had the sirloin, which was fantastic. His dad ordered the beef ribs which were absolutely out of this world. Smokey and practically melt in your mouth tender. The sides were good, not much to say about corn and baked potatoes although the baked beans were really good. We were also brought cotton candy, and Idk how anyone can make cotton candy any better than your regular cotton candy but it was delicious. We will definitely come back.",

    "text": "Arrived couple minutes before 5pm but the hostess still seated me near the window with an amazing view. My server came by soon to take my order, which I already knew exactly what I wanted - prickly pear juice (alcoholic) and the rattlesnake with prickly pear cactus fries. For the drink, you get to choose to have it frozen or on the rocks, with sugar or salt.  She came back with some bread, and butter - regular butter and cinnamon butter. I loved the cinnamon butter, in fact, it's the first place that I have been to that offers it! The bread is more on the oily side, don't think it was perfect to start a meal but it tasted decent. What I didn't like, was that there was no butter knife. I had to use a steak knife to spread my butter on the bread.   My drink came shortly and it tasted amazing. Sweet, but amazing. Then my food arrived about 10 minutes after. Massive portion I have to say, I was only able to finish about 60%. Both the snake and the fries were deep fried, not your McDonalds fried food, but your KFC fried food with a extra layer of breading then fried again. The fries were..interested. I kind of liked the weird texture it had. I could honestly barely taste the rattlesnake since it was so deeply buried in the thick breading. I bite into one in half to observe the meat - it was definitely a tiny piece, which explains why I couldn't compare it to other meat since it was hard to tell the texture and the flavour.  I asked my lovely server about the rattlesnakes and why/where it is offered. She said it's almost like a delicacy, they have their rattlesnakes delivered from Texas, and in fact, they are the only store that sells them in Phoenix. I can imagine many tourists in Phoenix visiting Rustler's simply for this dish, yet it is priced reasonable. Really appreciate it!",

Sadly, we were quite disappointed. They are known for their bbq, but  the meat choices for their brunch are not the best, except for the brisket. The Prime rib was dry and overcooked. BBQ ribs had no meat on the bones,the ham, dried out. Also, It was quite expensive for brunch, so I feel there should have been more than 1 mimosa included. We were seated upstairs, it was overcrowded, and clumsy to make our way downstairs for food, it was difficult to find the serving stations. We have crossed this off for future brunch options.",

The carrots were half cooked, one of our steaks was cold and  not cooked properly. Be careful walking around there, because the flooring is uneven, there are bridges, and slanted walk ways, really silly.  As you first approach the restaurant, you smell the real bull they have in a pen. Not really what you want to whet your appetite.  The live band was ok, but too loud for dining. And the table for 5 of us was too small. We had to wait for a table on a Tuesday night, even tho there were plenty of tables ready. For 3 of us it was $100....not money well spent at all. We will not go here again. Complete waste of money, time and dining experience.",

We went today for our anniversary and reserved a spot at 5 pm.  Got sat right away but our waitress took a while to get over to us. Our waitress was a bit slow, her name wasJasmine.  You expect for a place that you have to make a reservation for and pay a high price to eat, they would ensure the waitress's are excellent. This one was not.   The other pro was that the food was delicious! We had the nachos for an appetizer, salad, fried bread, biscuits, baked beans and the steak was Devine! It was cooked perfectly and very tender. My husband was left at the table and paid but the waitress never gave us the cotton candy that we were supposed to get.  We waited for around 10 minutes after asking her for it and ended up leaving without it.",

This is so shocking because this is a steak house, but I could literally make steaks better on the stove top in my kitchen.   One other thing that rubbed me wrong about the visit - my young children were all in line for the slide. They range in ages between 2 and 9. They waited and waited and waited for their turns, they were so excited. Out of no where an employee came up and roped off the line and proceeded to allow himself and a party of 20-30 drunk adults cut all the children and go down the slide. My four year old was bawling her eyes out. We teach our children to wait and here are all the adults cutting them. Many children were already at the bottom of the line waiting for their siblings while these drunk adults came down the slide laughing. Some were wearing dresses and everyone at the bottom could see EVERYTHING!! No class at all.   After a $700 bill for horrible food and a bad experience with the staff cutting kids in line- we will definitely not be back.",

That and the cactus fries. Both were not bad. The salad is basic and enjoyable. The lettuce was crisp and it wasn't over dressed. The side of beans were lacking....maybe some good salsa would have helped them. The pork ribs were the best thing we ordered. They had a good amount of meat and BBQ sauce. Personally I prefer to taste the meat a bit more then all the bbq sauce but again this is a touristy place. The carrots were completely over cooked but my daughter has braces so she liked them. The nachos were very basic, the jalapeno made it work. My group enjoyed the slide and the magician. He was very entertaining. The live music was also enjoyable. Again it's touristy and there was a bit of everything including the live bull out front named horny. Service was good. It however must have been our table location as two servers tripped at our table when bringing us our food. One ended up with the dip all down him. He never did bring us more dip, now that I think about it. The second server almost ended up with the tray on her also. When we left I notice they were cleaning up broken glass. So I'm not sure if there is just not clear walking paths or what. Portions are good sizes however it's a bit pricey for what you get.",

    "text": "We went to Rustler's Rooste as a team dinner for my daughter's volleyball team while attending a tournament in Phoenix.  The best things about this place is the atmosphere as the team and parents are not used to this western style motif restaurants with sawdust everywhere.  The other thing was the magician who comes to the tables and entertains the guests.  He was up close and personal, but yet was able to amaze us all with his tricks.  Our server, Ricky, was especially helpful and nice as well.  Our group ordered the rattlesnake appetizer and each person had a taste of the rattlesnake. What can I say?  It tastes like heavily battered dark meat chicken.  I ordered the All-you-can-eat spicy beef ribs.  First of all, not spicy, and I thought I could eat two or three plates of these ribs when I first got mine.  I couldn't finish a single plate.  They were okay.  They were kind of bland, but slathered in a bbq sauce.  If you can eat a lot of beef ribs, for the price, it's not a bad deal.  The best thing on my plate was actually the corn on the cob.  Many of the people at my table said the same thing which tells you what they thought of their main course.  All in all, this place is more of a novelty and a gathering place for people to drink, but not the place for a fine dining experience.  The girls had fun while the parents complained about the prices.  I can officially cross this off my bucket list of restaurants that I've experienced.  Cheers!",

    "text": "Great place for out-of-towners!  This is the atmosphere they are expecting when they first get to the Valley of the Sun.  Many folks are shocked when they learn there is more than just cacti and cowboys here is the desert.  Once they get over it, I find it fun to end their trip with the vision they had in mind when they first arrived.  Ever since I was a child, I have enjoyed waving hello to Rustler's Rooste official greeter, Horney T. Bull, before walking up the ramp to the hostess stand.  Another staple is the slide to get down ground floor, hours (OK, minutes) of fun for children and adults alike.  Sawdust on the floor, country band on stage, probably some two-stepping going on the dance floor, and a spectacular view of the valley.  Oh, and don't forget to get your picture taken with your face as Horney or a cowboy (be sure to check out mine too)!  At my first Yelp event, I won a $50 gift certificate to come back to the Rooste.  We decided to use it on one of my favorite holidays . . . Christmas Eve-Eve (December 23).  Long story . . .  We started out with the fried rattlesnake.  Tasted like chicken, yet a little chewy like calamari.  The mini fry breads they brought out before the entree were one of my favorite parts of the meal.  The salad came pre-dressed with a ton ranch, but c'mon this is Cowboy food, what do you expect.  I ordered the Mixed Grill with fillet medallions and sauteed shrimp.  The portion wasn't huge, but it was enough to fill me up, and it tasted good, so I was happy.  I have also been to the Rooste for happy hour more times than I can count (way before \"check-ins\" were around, so I don't have the stats to prove it).  This is for sure an Arizona classic and will always have a special place in my heart.  From childhood fun, to family gatherings, drunken sliding during happy hour and Yelp events, I've had a blast!  Thanks again to Yelp for the $50 gift certificate I won at the Hoe Down and thanks to the Rooste for providing that cowboy atmosphere when we need it!  YEE HAW!!",

I was a little disappointed when I realized the restaurant was at a resort because sometimes it's hit or miss with service. We did call ahead seating which is a great idea and recommended. We had to wait maybe 20 minutes once we showed up but that was fine because there was lots to see around the restaurant. You could kind of smell Horny, the cow, from outside but it wasn't too bad. The bartenders were very nice and friendly. Once we made our way to the table we were pleasantly surprised with a great views of the city. Our server came almost immediately and throughout the entire meal he was attentive. The four of us ordered steaks and they were absolutely beyond delicious including the sides. I could have just eaten the bread alone with the honey butter. The vegetables were at the right temperature and the beans melted in your mouth. We took the nine layer chocolate cake home. Frosting was creamy and perfect with coffee next morning. I highly recommend this place when you have guests from out of town or when you just want a great steak. Right on Rustlers Rooste. By the way try the rattlesnake it tastes like chicken... It really does and the side sauce is very tasty.",

    "text": "So bummed!  We had been waiting to hit this place up- the fam was excited too!!  We called to find out if they accepted reservations this particular evening they were doing walk ins only, which was fine. But our hotel clerk said make sure we get reservations. The hostess over the phone said, \"as long as your here in the door seated by 10, you will get service.\"  WRONG!  We got there at 9, our waiter was super bugged we were even there. Offered the special- which was fish or something then he proceeded to say, \"well- it was the special, but we're all out.\"  Then brings out bread and salad with no plates, says he will be right back and doesn't come back for 7-10 minutes So we eat bread and biscuits off napkins as the kids (2 of em') were starving. Finally brings plates gets our order and about 20-25 mins later brings our food. It was pretty good, we finish and he TELLS the kids,  hey kids do you want Cotton Candy- comes back and tells the kids. Sorry!  COME ON!?!  don't tell the kids your bringing it and then tell them never mind!!!!!  They get a balloon made, which was pretty cool and the server is quick to push us out the door. We tell them we are staying at the resort so they can call us the shuttle. We wait outside for 10 mins, go in and tell the bartender that we have been waiting. He proceeds to tell my husband, \"just look for him, he's out side. I know if I call him he's just gonna tell me he's outside.\"  He wasn't. We waiting another 10 and finally made it back. Service sucked, people except the balloon maker sucked, food was pretty good. I guess my suggestion is go in the middle of the day or not at all!",

This past Saturday (Jan. 14, 2017) we went there for my 60th birthday.  I regret to say we were disappointed.  The place was overly crowed.  This was not their fault.  Due to crowding we got the worst table in the place, right next to the kitchen door.  It was very noisy.  The usually good house salad lacked enough dressing.  Our water glasses were not kept full.  The waitress was okay, but somewhat inattentive to our needs.  This was probably due to the crowd.  My Prime Rib was tough, although the 3 others with me said their entrees were good.  The children in the place were allowed to run around and crowd on the slide.  I will give them one more try.",

The view is fantastic if you can somehow sit by the window. I was there on a Friday around 530pm. Place was pretty empty but within an hour it filled up pretty good. They have a cool little slide to go down when on the 2nd floor. The ambiance is really nice. It has a real western theme. I had the salmon. So much food. So, much, food. Came with a salad. Minus points for only having ranch or oil and vinegar. Came with a real sweet bread and biscuits with cinnamon butter and regular butter. Came with rice pilaf and corn on the cob which were pretty darn good.  And....if you act now, it also came with beans. The beans were cooked with cut up hot dogs or something and some tomatoes in a tomato/barbecue like sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It had a nice sear to the top. The happy hour is pretty good. All in all, this place is a great find.",

Kids love it here and will always remember the \"place with the slide\". For the adults, well you pay for the view and that's it. The food is a poor trade of price, shameful that they know it too. No server seems to take pride, and obviously the cook doesn't either.  Don't expect a southern cowboy chuckwagon feast; instead you'll get kraft mac n cheese, dry chicken, dry salmon, and decent rolls. For even a $35 steak, you'll get iceberg lettuce with bland dressing and dirty, tiny bathrooms. It's a shame they've let this treasure go so downhill.",

Having brought several friends and family members to Rustler's Rooste over the years to enjoy the view of the valley, the average over-priced food and carnival atmosphere (pushy magicians working for table tips) were often overlooked.  My last visit was on 4/1 and will definitely be my last.  The Rooste was quite busy for a Sunday, we had been told it would be a 45 minute wait to be seated (despite empty tables), which turned into an hour long wait, and then with a 3 month old baby in tow, we were seated above the band, which was obnoxiously loud and wasn't the most appropriate choice for a newborn.  It was IMPOSSIBLE to have any kind of conversation.    Our waiter gave us some bread and butter and then told us he'd get come back shortly and take our drink orders, but after passing our table a half dozen times in 15 minutes, he didn't seem too interested in making sure we had beverages, so we got up and left.    Consider checking out other local establishments in South Phx/Tempe, like The Farm at South Mountain, Los Dos Molinos, The House at Secret Garden, Amano Bistro, and etc before considering this tourist trap.",

The bartender was fun to talk to, and I wish that we had just stayed and ordered dinner from him. We started noticing people that came in after we did were being seated, so we asked and they finally seated us. We were served the saddest looking iceburg salad with watery ranch, and some cold fry bread pucks. We ordered two medium rare NY stripe steak, and they were brought to us cold, well done, with some nasty over cooked veggies. At this point I'm so hungry I want to cry. My poor husband had worked a 14hr. day, and this was our anniversary! The waitress was nice and took back our steak, commenting that maybe the restaurant was too dark for us to see if our steak was medium rare. Really?! We gave up and walked out. I don't know how this place has stayed in business this long?",

They sat our party of 7 in a booth for six and told us we would have to wait longer for a bigger table. Oh, wait... What about all the other 8 person open tables. Well those sections are closed. We have been sitting at our table for 20 min. now with little sight of our server.... Keep you posted. It has been 30 min now and 9:05pm the kids are pretty hungry. Wait there goes our server again... Well maybe next time. Dinner ordered its 9:15, let's see how long it takes. So the dinner came pretty quick 9:35. 3 in our party ordered chicken fingers and onion rings. The server failed to tell us the onion rings only come as an appetizer, so we have 3 full baskets or rings and plates of fries and chicken fingers. We also got a garden burger, steak, and 2 kids chicken fingers and fries. The steak was pretty good and my wife said the garden burger was good. It is now 10:00 pm. We are waiting on the bill now... 10:05, we are walking out. Very bad experience! Avoid this place!",

Because it comes with the snake's deep-fried SKELETON!  I give it 3 stars because although it is a superb spot with unique food and even a slide (embarrassing or fun, you decide), the decor is overboard western kitsch. The hanging skins and taxidermied snakes are ummm...ok in smaller doses. Plainly put, it's not a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant, but the rattlesnake was mouth-watering.",

    "text": "Took mom to @rustlersrooste for Mother's Day Brunch  Probably won't go back for a buffet any time soon.  We were seated on the patio. Nice view today, neglible smog impediment. Misters, and a nice occasional breeze, kept us quite comfortable.  The buffet had a decent selection of items, including roast beef, roast ham, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, Eggs Diablo, fajitas, spanish rice, etc.  Let me just say that the Eggs Diablo was delicious!  Moving on to everything else; The bacon was overcooked, to the point of being almost black The biscuits for the biscuits and gravy were a bit dry, and the gravy was sweet. I have no idea whose idea that was, but it most certainly doesn't work. The wafflse station had cream cheese, strawberries, I believe cherries, and cinammon-backed apples. The apples were superb! Perfect consistency of slightly tender but not mushy, and VERY flavorful. The strawberries should have been capped, or at least cored, but they were tasty, and did not appear to have been sitting for a long period of time. The beef fajitas had no spiciness at all. It was the blandest fajitas I have ever tasted. The roast beef was cooked properly but was also bland The selection of desserts looked visually appealing, but all those I tasted gave the impression that they were purchased off-site and delivered, not prepared fresh on-site. Of the desserts and the entree selections, nothing stood out, except the oatmeal cranberry cookies, which stood out for being hockey-puck hard.  The server was attentive, if only barely. I gave her a bit of a break, however, as it seemed that we were the only table she had on the patio. (Not the only people sitting on the patio, only people she was responsible for)  Given the price, I expect better quality, but I suppose perhaps I shouldn't, given the reality that rustlers is a cowboy steakhouse. Having eaten there in the past, I can attest to the quality of the western/cowboy type meals they serve.  I will visit Rustler's Rooste again, if only for the joy of seeing my daughters enjoy the slide, and the view, and some good cofort food.  But I will not likely return for their buffets, and I would not likely recommend anyone visit them for a buffet.",

There was a concert here and the line for that was extremely long and full of drunks ! They were blocking the handicapped parking spaces And reluctant to move so we could park. When we did get parked (2 of us are disabled and could not climb the hill) we were accosted by the drunks verbally.  We had a nice meal and when we came out there were beer cans on my bumper and some idiot had placed a beer bottle behind the rear tire of my pickup. Great behavior for an adult !  My wife and I ordered the \"Cowboy Stuff\" platter and it was decent. I think next time we will stick with a steak though, they looked great and the platter we had was a bit lacking on actual meat. it was more veggies, potato's and filler. Look forward to returning and next time we'll make sure there is not an event going on so we don't have to deal with all of the drunks !",

    "text": "We had a big family get together and came here, all 16 of us, 8 being kids under 12. We had a great evening of visiting and being together in a fun western atmosphere. Appreciated that the wait staff accommodated our reservation and placed us at a big table by the slide so the kids could play, which they enjoyed.  The fellow who did the balloon art for the kids was great and had their full attention and was kind to our kids. The service was slow but we were a big group so...food was okay but not the excellence they mentioned on the menu.  Had ribs and sides served with it.  Had ribs and rib meat was tender but drowned in BBQ sauce, corn was soggy and sticky from being over-cooked and then cooled and rewarmed, carrots were-bland no flavor or seasoning.  We waited too long to order but the atmosphere and being together outweighed so I didn't mind waiting.  Will come again because it's a fun place to bring guests but I hope the food improves--it could really be much better and then I would give it more stars.",

I am not sure if this is a beef freshness indicator or just for the kids, but it is a cool touch nonetheless. The view of the sunset was fabulous.

    "text": "It's so sad that I have to give this place two stars because of the service. I have never been or even heard of this place till I Googled family friendly restaurants. I saw that you can enter the restaurant on a slide and knew it was a go because the kids would dig that. We walk up and pass a huge stinky cow or ginormous something in the front. Kids were loving it. We walk up to the hostess stand and there are 3 hostesses and a manager standing there. One of them is blowing her nose into a napkin very loudly the whole time we stand there. Um.....aren't there bathrooms for that? My stomach did tiny somersaults of protest. We sit down and our server just sucked. She completely ruined my experience. The view is freaking amazing,. You can see the whole valley. It could have been my little hidden date gem but even that is not enough to lure me back. The server was rude to both my mother and I. She never told us about the specials, she never asked if I wanted my soft drink refilled, she never asked if I wanted dessert....she just plain sucked. Bland, slow, no personality. Then I had to hear her complain that the manager wouldn't give her Christmas off and how some other guy got it off claiming he was visiting family but his family is here etc................Dude! Take it to the kitchen!  The food was good......I had the Fillet, mom - T-Bone. The steaks were cooked perfectly.....the bread was good with the pumpkin butter, not a big fan of the green beans and beans. After the nose blowing and attitude, I can't see any super compelling reason to return, even the sparkly city views. :(",

We arrived at about 6:30 and had a tough time finding parking sober decided to use valet. It's no charge so it's really a no-brainer. We were seated right away. Server was friendly and food came out pretty quick. I had ribs and steak medallions. Flavor of the ribs was spot on but the cut was awful. A lot of gristle and fat. Steak was incredible. I was disappointed with the sides though. They didn't really give you any options. You get whatever they roll out like it or not. Anything extra and you have to pay. Kid had a burger (a $16 burger!) and it was good. Pricey but good. Wife had fried chicken. It was also pretty good. For dessert we had the cow pie which is ice cream under a chocolate shell. This thing was so frozen solid that we needed to break it apart with a knife to eat it! It was way to big of a dessert! No way a small party could eat it all. We didn't even get halfway through it. All in all dinner was OK but the service was a bit slow and the prices were waaaaay too high for the quality. Drift drinks, dinner and dessert came to $80 with tip. Next time I'll stick with Aunt Chiladas or go off site.",

Our food was worse, we ordered baked potatoes and never got them, the salad was drenched in ranch and soggy.

I honestly was preparing for the worst but everything was great!   Our sever served as water right away and after taking our orders he served us a bread basket, my son loved their sweet cinnamon butter spread. Then we were served their house salad, which was also really delicious.   Our food came out pretty fast, I ordered the Garden burger and finished the whole thing, it came with a very small size of their vegetarian chili which was very flavorful but I was hoping for a cup sized not a sample size, it also came with lots fries, which I did not really care for fries. They were not crispy or any flavor.   My husband got the bbq ribs, he loved it! He finished the all the food on his plate, it came with a corn on a cob, carrots, n bbq beans.   My son who normally don't eat, ate most of his meal (huge consider it was a kids meal) he have giant chicken tenders, fries, and a slice of fruit!

Steaks are fine (a 3.5/5), but you're there for the beautiful view and fun atmosphere. My family has been going here for years, as my mom loves the views at sunset. In fact, we threw my parent's 25th wedding anniversary party here. Staff is fun and they don't over-do the cheesi-ness of the southwest (as in, they're not saying HOWDY PARTNER all night).   Here's what we like to order:   Endless Ribs. Say what!?! Yes, endless ribs. And last time we were there, they were only $17.   Sliced baked potato fries (or whatever they're called). It's pretty much a baked potato, cut into 4, and served with the most delicious ranch ever.   Someone in your group should order a steak, just because it's a steakhouse. Good, not great, but I've never had bad steak here.   Most meals come with salad (typical, starter salad), bread (ok bread, but the cinnamon butter is delish), beans, and I believe corn on the cob.   If you make it for happy hour, they have a good menu as well, and nice bartenders.   Overall, great value, and a fun place to eat.",

We had the  nachos and onion rings as apps. Everything tasted fantastic and the place was super fun. We'll definitely be back on our return to Poenix.",

    "text": "The hostess staff and food were lackluster. I came in excited to try the place out and it was disappointing to be greeted with someone who clearly didn't want to be there. Our server was nice. I ordered the Rustler's cut. The meat was pretty flavorless, a little over cooked, and pretty dry. I had higher expectations especially since steak makes up a good portion of the menu, so you'd expect it to  be something they've perfected over time. Truly disappointing. The view was really beautiful from the outdoor area, but overall- that was the only thing that I felt good about.",

    "text": "A solid 3 stars. Neat concept. Pretty good food but it was hit or miss. Our order is as follows:  * Complimentary Bread Basket - biscuits and fried Mexican bread. It was just ok.  * Fried Rattlesnake and Cactus appetizer - it was good, though we liked the cactus a bit more than the rattlesnake. Rattlesnake was nothing special but a must try for us since we love trying new things.  * Entrees include Beans, Family style salad, and cotton candy - beans were not good. Salad was very tasty. And who doesn't like cotton candy? * Mixed Grill entree with Filet Medallions and Ribs - pretty good. Ribs were tasty.  * Rustler's Cut - definite pass! First time my steak came out dry dry dry and was sent back. 2nd time they brought it out first bite was good and manager came to ask about it. He left, I took a second bite and reached a very raw steak. I guess they tried to cook it too fast and only 'seared' the outside. At that point I was pretty full so didn't say anything.   Service: Our original waitress was flighty and couldn't seem to concentrate. Took bf's order then ran off. Brought us the salad and I had to ask to put my order in. Come our entrees and they brought out 3 plates... Wtf? Never came by to refill anything. Thankfully another nice waiter jumped in after seeing our frustration. From then on smooth sailing.",

Some people expected a top notch eating experience, and that's not what it is.  1.) Good atmosphere- live music and southwest feel 2.) Spotty service- felt like I was being ignored a little bit 3.) Decent food- aside from the rattlesnake, the rest of the food want special. It was nice that they kept us busy with bread and salad, and even brought cotton candy out after our meal, but the streak was subpar and the vegetables were undercooked  While this place wasn't awful, it wasn't amazing either. Little kids won't know the difference and it might be a pleasant experience for you.",

    "text": "This place was a joke from start to finish.  First off, I took my wife here for her Birthday.  I was looking for unique place that had a good view and I came across Rustler's Roost.  As far as the view goes, it definitely delivers.  The place is very cool and has nice \"date night\" atmosphere.  Unfortunately that's where the positive experience ends abruptly.  We were promptly seated at the table and given our menus.  The place is very dimly lit and the menu, for some strange reason, seems to be printed on brown paper.  As a result, you need to use your cell phone in order to read the menu, without holding it directly to your nose.  It was comical to see everyone else doing the same around the room.  Hint: this might be where, oh I don't know, a manager has the menus or lighting changed in order to avoid future embarrassment, but that is small potatoes compared to the issue they have the food and kitchen.  Our order consisted of an app of the Buffalo wings and steak entrees (both me and my wife) with a side of mash potatoes.  The Buffalo wings appeared at the table within 3 minutes of ordering, which immediately had me suspicious.  You guys really can't cook wings to order?  Seriously?  They were soggy, luke warm,  and tasted very bland (this will be a theme).  We actually got our appetizer a full 15 minutes before we got bread to the table.  Was the fry bread and rolls warm?  NO!  Why did it take so long to get out?  Crickets.  I tried to remain positive that the steaks would make up for the starters and bread, but alas I was struck down.  This was literally the worst steak I have ever had in a \"restaurant\", for one very basic reason.  IT HAD ABSOLUTELY NO SEASONING!  NONE.  Wow, not only did I ask for it medium and what they brought was rare, but it had zero seasoning.  No salt, no pepper, anywhere.  The plate had a large amount of mushy cafeteria carrots and corn on the cob that tasted like it was microwaved.  Oh and, no seasoning on any of those items either!  I have seen a few positive reviews on this place, and I am dumbfounded.  Our meal came out to $85 before tip and we hardly touched anything on the table.  I took 3 bites of steak, 1 bite of carrots, and 3 bites of corn and that was all could handle.  You would think the waitress would notice that our plates were still full when we asked for our ticket, but she said nothing, which tells me this is a common occurrence 'round these parts.    I walked in on a date with my wife and walked out dejected, having been robbed of $85 and still very hungry.  I mean for that money you would think I could have gotten at least a little salt and pepper, but no.  Owners/Management need to take a closer look at who's in their kitchen and serving their food.  Or maybe themselves, I'm not sure who's responsible but when you find out, tell 'em I want my $85 back.",

We just finished dinner here for my birthday and not only did our services suck but the food was even worse! The corn and carrots tasted like they were boiled in dirty water and that water seeped onto my very tough steak. YUCK! So we complained about it and the manager asked if he could bring us out another one but we were no longer hungry from how disgusting  the food tasted. So we sat with our meals in front of us for a good 20 min. When the bill came our steaks were still on it. When we asked the manager to take it off he argued with me telling me that if he had something to take back to the kitchen he could do something.... they just cleared our table. Finally he took them off when we said we might come back but I really don't think that's going to happen. Learn how to handle a complaint.",

Food quality: rolls and salad tasted good. Nothing mind blowing but good. I ordered the rib eye. Not bad. Also not good. Imagine buying the lowest level grade steak from the store and cooking it without much thought. No crazy spices. Edible but not great. Came with vegetables that didn't look terribly healthy. I wasn't expecting fine dining but was hoping for more. Was there with 4 other people and the feeling towards the food was mutual among us.   Ambiance: it was ok. A bit loud but I was sort of expecting that after walking past the huge smelly bull out front :) I did take the slide which was funny.   Would I come back:  unlikely. I'm glad we tried it so I can say I've tried it but the food wasn't terribly enjoyable and it certainly wasn't cheap so there are much better options in that part of town.",
