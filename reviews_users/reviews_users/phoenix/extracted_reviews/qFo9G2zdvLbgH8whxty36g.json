We arrived later in the evening and everything was messy...the floors, the bathrooms, even the hibachi and table still had bits food on it from the previous service. Host staff were pretty much indifferent and were jokingly throwing things at each other while we stood there and waited. Our chef was really nice and warned us he was new, but he hadn't been trained well and messed up orders/overcooked or under seasoned everything...that's not on him, that's on management. The food was ok but the whole experience was not worth the price paid. Won't be back to this location.",

    "text": "The worst service I have ever gotten. We made a reservation for a birthday party and everyone showed up on time; however, the hostess made us wait another 30 minutes because she mistakenly thought we need a table for 24 (the reservation was for 12). We finally got seated, only to find out 10 minutes later that 3 complete strangers would be sitting with us (after we specifically asked for them not to do that). Then, only 1 of our servers for our 2 tables came over and proceeded to take drinks orders only for the first table. When we asked her if she could take our drink orders for the second table (one of whom was a child), she refused because \"it's not my table.\" 45 more minutes go by before our second server finally came over to take our drink order. Honestly, the only reason I gave them 1 star is because I can't give 0. Once we finally got the food, they'd mixed up our orders and it was insanely overpriced. I will never be returning to this restaurant and I suggest you dine anywhere else but here!",

    "text": "After hearing so much scuttlebutt about Benihana, I had to jump at the chance to try it out for myself.  I am glad I did.  I ate dinner there in a small group, a second group of people was seated around the same hot stove.  Although our two groups did not interact much, it was evident from other tables that there was some intermingling going on.  This made for a fun, lively atmosphere.  There were many birthday celebrations being had, and by the end of the night I could sing Happy Birthday in fluent Japanese.  The cook arrived shortly after our orders were placed and put on quite the show as he prepared our food.  The meals were all oriented around some form of meat, I got the feeling that a vegetarian would not be happy here.  Portions were very large and served piping hot.  Though nobody at our table consumed any, \"adult\" beverages were available but pricey.    The filet, lobster, new york steak, and fried rice were all excellent.  Two varieties of sushi that we tried were excellent as well.  A caveat here is that if you are arriving hungry, you will be starving by the time your food is ready.  The only downside to having your food prepared before your eyes is that you are presented with wonderful aromas during the entire preparatory process.    Yes, the meals are pricey.  Yes, the wait times can be obscene.  But with a reservation for a special occasion, this is a fine place to dine out.",

The bartenders weren't mean or anything, but they didn't really seem to care either. They took the wings off the bill and apologized but it still seemed disingenuous. Not really impressed.",

We had a 7:30 reservation, and were seated at around 7:40 (why they make reservations, who knows?).   There were six of us, and another couple was seated at our table. One of my gripes with this style of cooking, is that the dining space is super tiny. With all of our drinks (one each) at the table, there was hardly any room for error. Either way, our server was super nice and took very good care of us. The meal was good, albeit expensive, which is what one should expect when going to Beniana's. Everything was cooked great though, very fresh and yummy. This is definitely a place that you come for the experience as well as the food.",

The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.   But the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade.",

This night, it wasn't up to me so I joined a group of 6 on a Friday night around 7pm.  It was packed and we had about a 20 minute wait.  We were sat with 2 strangers at the community table, which seemed kind of awkward.  As a vegetarian, I saw one large slab of grill? skillet? and could only think of meat juices touching my noodles.  Sure, I get it, my grilled cheese at another restaurant may be made on the same surface as a burger....but at least I don't have to see it!    Anywho, my edamame and noodles were tasty for what they were.  The service was pretty attentive and the cook was somewhat engaging (could've been better).    Overall, it just wasn't my cup of tea.",

(We spent around 1500 dollars at this place) we got a random white dude as our chef..he didn't do any tricks... And any that he did try he would mess up and say \"cmon guys to have to cheer me on here!!\" Sorry man, we are not going to cheer you on if you can't even do one trick on the grill. There were people I was with who had never gone to something like this before... So it was disappointing. He even stacked the onions up and I told my friend next to me, get ready he's going to light it on fire!!! So he got his phone out to record it (other places do this) only to find out that random white guy was just going to scoot it slowly across the surface of he grill and pull out a whistle that sounded like small child's train toy, and act like the onions were a train.... Super lame dude. The food and show is better at AH SO and its less expensive and it's centrally located instead of driving all the way to chandler.  Waitress was nice, food was good, oh, and the bartenders need to learn how to make drinks, I shouldn't have to explain how to make any shots I order that are pretty standard...

I made reservations for 730 on a Wednesday night for a table of 8 . It was a birthday get-together . When we arrived we had to wait 30mins to get a table & another 30mins for our server after being seated . I understand if the restaurant was busy but it wasn't . Our server first asked if there were any birthdays & we replied yes . She said happy birthday & took our orders . It took about another 15mins for our cook to arrive . Our cook, Juan was amazing & the food was good . I enjoyed the food but I felt like the server wasn't very attentive . After our cooked arrived & he started on the chicken fried rice he had to run all the way back to the kitchen because our server forgot the rice bowls . While, eating I was wondering why we didn't get a happy birthday song at our table because everyone else seemed to be having a birthday . After eating it was time to pay . We asked Tania, our server to split our checks & she asked everyone if there was anything else we needed . We simply replied no because we were all stuffed . When it was time to pay, I handed her a coupon & she had an attitude and said \" that's why I asked \" but she didn't ask us anything about coupons she jst asked if we needed anything else . So I was very confused . She had an attitude but Ignored it and paid my bill . Upon leaving our server says to the birthday girl \" happy early birthday! \" & that's why we didn't get a birthday song because the server thought it was an early birthday dinner . Overall, my first experience there was HORRIBLE & I highly doubt I will be back .",

    "text": "Went here on Wednesday to take advantage of the $30 certificate. It was quite busy, which probably shouldn't of been a shock, location and all, so had to wait awhile but that is the risk of not getting reservations right? =P.   Anyways, spent time in the bar which was nice, the bartenders were willing to answer questions, though not always the most chatty, but I think that was due more to how busy it was then not being friendly. The happy hour prices looked pretty good, $2 hot sake, $3 beer, $4-5 cocktails. Sushi was also on the cheap, Nigiri was from about 1.25-2 dollars I believe, and the other rolls ran from 3-5 dollars at the worst. They also have some non-sushi appetizers on there.   Once we got a table, we were paired with another group, which was actually a nice experience as I do like the communal type seating stuff. Granted if you have a small group and not a fan of eating with strangers, might not like it much.   Since it is a place I always consider more about a show then the food, going to start with that first. The show was eh, they do some of the knife play stuff, and a few things here and there, but honestly it wasn't all that exciting compared to the other place I've been (Sakura). The chef was friendly though, and the server was personable so that is a plus. Otherwise was a bit disappointed with the show portion of the meal.   As for the food, I had the Filet Mignon and lobster tail. The filet was supposed to be medium, but came out more medium well in my opinion. It was lightly seasoned, leaving mostly a beef flavor then anything else. Now it had a good beef flavor, so by no means complaining just like a bit more seasoning personally. The lobster tail was good, buttery from the butter, but more importantly nice and sweet. How it is to other lobster tails? can't really tell you as I don't eat it that much (college students don't exactly have that sort of cash you know? =P). But again thought it was good, wasn't fishy and nice and sweet.   At the end it came with a choice of ice cream, I tried the green tea ice cream which about the same as any other green tea ice cream I've had. Basically its sweet, with a hint of green tea taste, and that is about it.   They have to sing to you of course, and they take a picture which they give you with a code you can access for up to 60 days (I believe) to download it, which is a nice touch.   For the money, I really wouldn't go unless I had the certificate, however I would go back for the happy hour, probably my favorite thing of the whole night.",

If I spent any more, I would have been really sad.  My other friend ordered the fillet with teriyaki sauce instead of the garlic sauce, and while it was decent, it definitely wasn't worth the price tag.   While the show was nice and the service good, the food was obviously overpriced and not tasty. They have a program where you sign up on their email list and get sent a $30 gift certificate during your birthday month.

Thankfully, he had fam in town so we were able to sneak away to Benihana for some eats. Let's be honest, you know I had some drinks, too!  He had dined there before, but I had never tried out the establishment.  I made our reservation for 5:15, but when we arrived we were informed that they were running about 15-20 minutes behind. No biggie to us, we just bellied up to the bar and enjoyed some happy hour priced bevs (a peach sangria number and a patron margarita -which wasn't a happy hour item).  Once our table was ready, we were seated with a family of 6 at a spot near the entrance.   There were quite a few options for food and we both ended up getting the filet (mine with steamed rice and his with a double order of the chicken fried rice). The server was nice and was careful to take down everyone's order correctly.  All of our meals came with onion soup to start and then a small salad with a ginger vinaigrette, followed by a shrimp appetizer. We were having a gay ole time and then our chef, Stephen, came out.  He was good at keeping us all entertained, cooking the food at a perfect pace and made our steaks gloriously medium rare!  I loved the entire meal (and so did my boo).  I wouldn't say this is a place I'd go to all of the time, but I'd definitely come here for the occasional \"dinner and a show\".",

My steak was supposed to be medium well and my boyfriends medium rare. They put my steak on his plate and then we had to wait even longer for his steak to come out. After all the mishaps, we were ready for our check, we waited around 20 minutes before the waitress even realized we were ready. Terrible night not sure if I'll be coming back, the last few experiences have not been good.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to having lunch here in January.  We were unfortunately very disappointed.   We each ordered the lunch special.  I choice scallops and steak the others in the party chose steak, chicken and shrimp.  The cook at our table seemed nice and engaging.  He started cooking the vegetables and seafood first.  I was a bit surprised since scallops,shrimp and vegetables only take a short time to cook.  Our seafood was served a short time later.  Without any rice or vegetables.  He then started cooking the steak and chicken and finishing the vegetables.  Still no rice.  Vegetables were then served with steak following.  Still no rice.  Apparently the prep cooks in the back did not start the rice.  The cook left our table and came back in approximately 10 minutes.  He proceeded to cook the rice.  Meanwhile my scallops are cold and the steak was too.  We spent a significant amount of money as drinks were bought also.  In the cooks defense he was friendly and some what frustrated I am sure about the lack of rice.  We wont be planning a trip back anytime soon.",

The second time I called for a reservation (on a WEDNESDAY) a few hours from the time we wanted to celebrate my mom's birthday (a 5:30 pm time). I was told there is no availability at all from 4:45 to 8 pm.  I guess this is good for the Cheesecake factory nearby. Haha. Party of 8 coming at ya Cheesecake Factory!",

We did, however, go to reminisce on this sort of restaurant, and expected a decent well-priced meal with a fun atmosphere.   While the filet was delightful (shockingly so), and the yellowtail sashimi sufficient for our expectations, the Las Vegas roll was severely lacking, and the rest of the meal was served after apparently sitting around for a while.  Lukewarm food just doesn't cut it.  While we had hoped to enjoy the visit, there were just too many reminders why we haven't been in nearly ten years.  Nor will we return.",

Both the times we did not get a table on time and had to wait for atleast 15 mins. But once we are seated the service was excellant. The cooking table is a real good experience especially if it is your first time.  The servers were fast and the chefs are so energetic and funny that they will create a laughter riot throughout the cooking session. The food is cooked in front of you so you know exactly what goes into your stomach.   I am a vegetarian so I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING DIFFERENT SPATULAS FOR VEGETARIANS which is not the case. Just one used for anything and everything from prawns to tofus.    My husband is a lover of the chicken fried rice which he says is a must try. Quantify is very very minimal for the meal portions so be prepared for a huge bill. The meal comes with a complimentary ice cream and a birthday song sung by all the servers.  Overall a good experience and a must try place but with a lot of flaws.",

It took them until 8pm to start the grill and 8:15 until the chef started to cook. I will not be returning to this establishment anytime in the near future.

We showed up and the rest of our group followed. 8 of us were present and after 15 minutes past our time, they refused to seat us because our 9th was not there. Seriously!? ONE PERSON? We left and went to cheesecake factory.  Experience #2: This past January, my wife and I felt like we would walk in and use her birthday coupon on a Wednesday evening. With our last experience 2 years behind us, we went in with a fresh slate. The place was very busy and there were a handful of people waiting in the lobby. I was told it was an hour and a half to two hours to wait for the two of us to be seated. I turned to my wife and she said we'll pass, and once I turned back to the hostess and began to spoke, the girl turned around and walked away from me. What?! How rude!  So we make a reservation knowing its a busy place, and won't be seated (estimating: $25-30 a plate = nearly $300 of business) and just the two of us show up and we may not be seated for 2 hours? Like a previous review mentioned, they care more about overbooking reservations and leave no wiggle room for walk ins. Who in their right mind would go somewhere to eat and be told, you won't be eating for 2 hours! Absurd. The only way I'll give this place a third chance is if it's free, or someone else invites me to join them.",

But I guess when you cut it so thin, less than a quarter inch pieces it has to have something to hold it together. The salmon roll was the width of my little finger. The teriyaki could have been anything. Not going again. Spoke to the manager before I left and explained our disappointment but he did not seem bothered and offered no recompense. Service meanwhile was fine.",

We had a reservation at 7:00 pm and we were barely getting seated by 7:45pm! Im sure this happens so people will go to the bar and order drinks! Who trained these jokes? Im so tired of all these franchise companies to  get a bad rep because each location is doing their own thing and half ass the job not do what their job is supposed to be designed to make customer happy! Our chef also didn't have a personality at all and he dropped one of the cooking utensils when he was trying to show off his skills before he started cooking fried rice. How did he get hired? Makes perfect sense management is jacked up and employees are also jacked up with them. Definitely not coming back until they wake up and learn how to operate a simple restaurant business!",

Honestly, I've always thought this place was over rated and more of entertainment rather than fine dining. BUT the happy hour deals and because it's close to home has always kept us coming back when we're lazy to cook. We recently were here for boyfriend's birthday and found out they changed the $30 birthday deal. Used to be towards any menu item, but now you have to order any teppanyaki meal full price and then get $30 off additional  items. Which is still not bad, but I liked old desk better.",

Food took a long time to get started as for some reason our grill wasn't turned on so when they cook came it wasn't hot and he left until it was ready to cook on. Honestly, our server (Vanessa) was sooo rude to the other party sat at our table it was almost hard watch. She forgot half of our drinks twice. She never took empty salad or soup bowls off the table so the cook had to take them off and find somewhere to put them while trying to cook for us. She then argued out loud so rudely with couple next to us who had thought they ordered lobster. But she couldn't even get an ice cream order right at the end...(took her 3x) to bring 6 people ice cream, so who knows if he had ordered the right thing and she just was trying to cover her butt. She clearly didn't want to be there and doesn't know what customer service is. I've never seen anything like it. Never smiled, was rude the whole time. She missed out on a great tip. We made sure to tip our cook out in cash. As we weren't pleased at all with her service.  I'll probably never come back, she left a sour taste in my mouth when I now think of this establishment. It being our first time and all. 130 dollars spent for what?!",

I'm traveling on business and today, this was my treat to myself.  \"There's open seating over there with no wait or you'll have to wait for 45 minutes.\" Was the immediate response. I guess she wasn't expecting me to agree to wait because her hand was still pointing to over there. When she realized I was still standing there, she took my name to add me to the list. 10 minutes later I was being escorted to a table to sit along with 3 other parties. So much for that 45 minutes, huh?  The waiter comes around, introduces himself and takes drink orders. It takes him about 15 minutes to bring out drinks. And then it was about 15-20 minutes between soup and salad. Finally, the cool comes out an hour after we were seated. Drinks are empty, soup and salad is gone.   The cook was nice, he seemed a little bit nervous. I think he was fairly new. It took the cook 1 hours and 7 minutes to finish cooking from start to finish. As you can imagine, you had to eat your food separate unless you wanted it cold. Rice first, then shrimp appetizer, then zucchini, then the protein, finally the onion. By the time the onions made it to my plate (roughly an hour after the rice) I had no more food on my plate.   Do I even have to tell you what waiting for the check was like?  I already contacted google, FB, and your guest relations. (In case you want to ask me to contact guest relations to make it right)",

I'm very disappointed to read the growing list of bad reviews for this location, for years it has been a great place to go for celebrations, birthdays, etc. but it has lost its edge. I posted the details of my bad experience both here (I removed the details after speaking with location management by telephone) and on the web site Mr. Lee keeps directing people to. I received a call from someone that said they were management level at the location. They did offer to send me something to use on my next visit and to ask for a manager on my next visit so they could make sure I had a better time. I appreciate that but I declined both and told them every guest should have a great time, each time, and should not have to advise management that they are there due to a bad past experience. The person I spoke with told me that all the managers were having a meeting that night to discuss. Hopefully they will do so and get this location back to what it once was. As someone else mentioned, we did not have our pictures taken nor did we see anyone else having their pictures taken, which is too bad because we have been collecting ours for memories of our celebrations there. The manager I spoke with said they do still take pictures and that someone else must have had the camera. What?? On another note: Love the Garlic Butter, goes great with everything it is put on.  UPDATE: 5/23/19 - Lee C. of Benihana said they would follow up with me soon. I have not heard from anyone at Benihana other than what I wrote about in the above review. So, if someone was to follow up with me again, it did not happen.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Benihana during my birthday month (because of the birthday coupon) for the last 11 years. This year I've already been twice to celebrate both my birthday and another friend's birthday. When I came for my birthday a few weeks ago I was rather disappointed by both the server and the chef. The server was clearly busy with other tables. It took nearly 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and it was nearly impossible to grab his attention again. The chef didn't display the skills that chefs in previous years have.  Last night I came a second time and my experience wasn't much better. While the server was better, it still took a significant amount of time for us to get our drinks, soup, and salad. Overall, we were there nearly 3 hours and most of it was spent waiting. Like my previous experience a few months ago, this chef seemed to lack the skills I've seen in the past. I brought my boyfriend's son who's 8 because I thought he would love the experience but I was disappointed when the chef didn't display the showmanship that I expected.  I don't really feel the excitement in coming here that I've always had in the past. Basically, they need to hire more servers so drinks and other items come out in a timely fashion. They also need to either hire or train chefs better to maintain the caliber I've seen in previous years.  Just an FYI, teppan entrees include green tea but you have to ask for it. They don't automatically bring it out.  Also, not that this is a big deal because I'm pretty indifferent to it anyway... but they seem to no longer be taking the birthday photos.",

Other people Came in without reservations and they were sat before us wow!!!

I had to walk up to tell them I had a reservation and the hostess almost looked at me In disgust for saying that. So immediately we were given terrible customer service, they called my name when I got up the hostess laughed \"haha not you so soon sorry\" It was quite embarrassing. Maybe she should have specified which David she was calling.   Now let's get cracking on the food side... I ordered the hibachi chicken which I heard was great! So I was excited to start eating and thought maybe the food would out weigh the horrendous customer service, I was wrong. The onion soup was as if someone crumbled up a bag of funions and went to the local pond for the broth and just mixed It together. My chicken was absolutely flavorless and let's not forget chewy... I couldn't finish It. It was like the chef was focusing on his comedy routine more than making sure the Sam and Ella was cooked out of my chicken. I just wanted to leave as soon as we could, terrible experience and highly disappointed. (They also didn't offer any green tea at the end of dinner like they said they would on the menu)",

Well, since it was the only place we ate that night I don't think she is trying to save their ass. She also refused to honor my original gift certificate/coupon. I highly reccommend other places. At the extreme price  they charge for mediocre food that everyone should go elsewhere. There are other amazing places out there.",

    "text": "Well, we had a 4:45 pm reservation we had 7 of our 10 people waiting 10 mins ahead of schedule and they wouldn't seat the party until everyone had arrived. The remaining 3 people arrived at 4:48 pm. By 5:15 - 5:20 we were still waiting to be seated. We were here for a birthday celebration and I was extremely surprised that with more than 1/2 of our party and time to spare that they wouldn't seat us. We had a few small kids, a baby in a carrier, an 89 year old woman and they made us wait long afterward to be seated.   This was my first visit to Benihana and I wasn't completely impressed with the start of our visit. However, by the time we were seated things eased up a little bit. Although, interesting that no one made any mention of the hold up or the reasoning for the hold up since our table was open that entire time. Our chef was awesome! I wish I could recall his name because I actually saw him mentioned on here and was super excited when he was assigned to our table.   He did a stupendous job of impressing the kids and was very enjoyable to watch. I had the Yakisoba, the salad and the miso soup. Yes. it was amazingly good. I had bites of everyone's dish and they were all good. Really really good. I couldn't finish my entire dish so I ended up taking it home and upon reheating it, it was still very very good.   I wasn't responsible for paying the tab but from what I hear it really is expensive. So, as long as someone else is covering dinner I am totally in. HA! Seriously though, it's worth the experience even if it isn't a regular occurrence.",

It's currently 9:34 and we are still waiting for our chef while the table next to us got here after us and their chef is cooking their dinner.   I should have had my wife make me a sandwich",

Upon arriving there instead of greeting us with a welcoming \"hello\" she says \"do you have reservations?\" with a cold attitude, but being new to the restaurant we weren't aware that a reservation was necessary. She then states \"it's going to be an hour or so\" as though she didn't have time for us and wanted us to leave, which she accomplished. My husband did get a hold of the manager over the phone to complain about the hostess. The manager promised a return phone call by 5pm on Thursday but never called. So, this place is getting one star due to poor management which probably explains the lack of customer service skills. Needless to say we will not be returning.",

    "text": "We were a group of 3 people & were excited to go to Benihanas for a birthday celebration. My first shock was that they charge an extra $3.55 for chicken fried rice. We asked about the price if we did not order it with chicken, as some of us plan to have chicken as the main course. The price was the same!  The shrimp appetizer was a nice touch & we enjoyed it very much. Then came the steam rice, but wait!, we had not been service any of the main entree. By the time we had, the rice was cold. They could solve this by either waiting to serve the rice fresh or serve it with a lid on it. Our Chef's name was Nico & we were the 3rd. table he had ever cooked for and it showed. I ordered the steak & lobster. He cooked up a bunch of steaks, when I noticed that they were being cooked well. He then served me the steak. I informed him that I ordered medium rare. He smiled & giggled & then acted like he did not understand me. My wife tried to let our waitress know, but she walked off, because she said she had to take care of the table next to us. I grudgely ate it, as I did not want to upset the table, due to 2 other birthdays were also being celebrated.  When Tania, our waitress came by at the end, she asked how everything was & my wife explained that for $37.00 for a steak & lobster, I should at least get it cooked the way I ordered it. She apologized & asked if she should get a manager. We said yes. Well she came back 10 minutes later with the bill & then ran off again. We got tired of waiting & just wanted to pay & get out of there.",

If you are going to make fried rice for 8 people there should be more than a half piece of chicken breast in it.   3.) Just because the chef cooks in front of you doesn't mean the food will taste good.  4.) This is not authentic Japanese food. Sarku Japan inside the mall food court has more authentic Japanese food and Fry's Marketplace has more authentic sushi.   5.) The hibachi chicken rice is not worth the extra $3.50. Save that money for when you leave and you're still hungry.   6.) If you cook vegetables before meat then the vegetables will be cold by the time the meat is done cooking. This is common knowledge.  7.) Food is mediocre at best and I don't like being over charged for mediocre.",

Service was slow but our server was very nice- our chef was really disappointing to be completely honest. You could barely understand him- he really wasn't a showman at all and couldn't cook the food well! The scallops were torched, meats were overcooked. The best thing I ate that night was the Rainbow Roll- which was very fresh! The white peach saki sangria was also tasty! We decided to leave before dessert (take it to go) because I ended up not feeling well half way through the night.   Oh and on top of a $30 off coupon, we still didn't get out of there without spending close to $100. Medicore food for a very expensive price tag.  I think I'm done with Benihana.",

The food was great and our chef, Jeremy, put on a great show though I did notice some of the other teppanyaki cooks were a bit more animated.  The onion soup, salad and shrimp appetizer were as good as ever and the signature Mai Tai in a Buddha mug was delicious. I ordered the Splash 'N Meadow and asked for my meat to be cooked medium rare. It was the perfect texture and temperature. The shrimp were great, too. My husband had the mango shrimp and really liked them though he did mention the sauce was a bit sweeter than he'd anticipated.   The staff was really great and made sure we all had constant refills. Our server was very attentive and helpful when ordering. Go here for your next birthday but make sure you go online and get the free birthday coupon first.",

We knew there would probably be a wait, and we were about 20 minutes away. The girl who answered the phone said they couldn't take reservations for less than an hour's notice. I was fine with that and asked if it was busy and she said \"there's only two people in the lobby, but that can change any minute.\" I said we'll be there in 20 and hope to beat the rush, and we hung up. When we go there they said the wait was 2 hours! I asked them why they they didn't say that when I called and they first said I must have called the wrong location. I hit redial on my cell and it rang right to their front desk. So I said obviously I called the right place. Then they RUDELY said they never said that to me on the phone and asked who I talked to. I said it was a girl and they said there were only 2 girls answering the phone, but neither wanted to admit it. Then, one eventually admitted it, and I said \"so you did answer my call, then?! Why didn't you tell me how long the wait was when I asked instead of misleading me by saying there was only 2 people in the lobby?\" She only halfway said she was sorry and the manager was literally standing right there. I basically left because they made no attempt to make it right. Apparently they are willing to lose customers. Way unprofessional, and the decrease in their Yelp ratings over the last year shows I'm not the only one.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Benihana a few days ago for a birthday celebration. We have visited this restaurant several times in the past years and enjoy the treat of the teppanyaki. The food is always delicious and the meal is quite complete.  During this most recent visit, we were seated with a party of four and a party of 2. The party of 4 did not realize that we were all going to sit around one table. They were seated along the bench part of the table and were obviously displeased that they had to cram together so that my husband and I could also sit around the table. They were rude about this and because they made little effort to scoot together, my husband ended up being uncomfortable because he was not fully able to sit on the bench.  The meal was good although because I have an allergy, the chef said that the mushrooms would be cooked at the end. There ended up being no mushrooms cooked or served at all. In addition, the chef had forgotten to prepare my steak with the others and therefore I had to wait for it to be cooked toward the end of the meal.  I also noticed that over the years, the birthday treat has changed in value. I remember when I would get a boat made of pineapple and other fruits. Then it was simply a pineapple. Now it is simply two scoops of ice cream. While the meal itself is filling, I wonder if the economy has impacted this change.  This chef was new to cooking and while I'm glad that he is able to learn and practice, his tricks weren't as smooth and some of our food ended up cold because we were waiting to eat it with the rest of the entree.  The service was wonderful and our server Junko was always prompt and willing to refill our glasses and remove dishes once we had finished each course.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went here on new years day to have lunch along with another couple.  We called to make a reservation but were informed that they are booked up and we would have to wait to get seating.    When we first got to the restaurant we found the wait was only 15 minutes long which was great.   We got seated pretty quickly and were informed that a server would come to help us.  While seating we felt that the location wasn't really that busy  as there were 3 teppenyaki tables on our side that were empty. After waiting about 20 minutes at the table a server finally came to take our drink orders, we ordered two different lemonades.   Later he ordered our food items: colossal shrimp dinner menu with fried rice, Las Vegas roll, spicy hibachi chicken.   After ordering you wait for a cook to come to the table, that was an additional 15 minute wait.  When the cook comes to the table he confirmed our orders and began cooking up everything in a grand presentation.    So, my personal opinion is that they take a long time to get you seated drinks and food served.  I was starving so I may not have been that happy considering I had to wait not for the table but for everything else, however I give them a PASS since they stated that it would be a wait.  The food did not taste that great, and the side sauces they give to dip things had NO flavor.  The Las Vegas roll that we received I thought had no flavor either.  Maybe my taste buds were off but I definitely didn't think there was enough spice in anything that I ordered, and my food was supposed to be spicy!   On a positive note - my kids would have loved this place.  They really take the time to create a performance while cooking and I am positive that my kids would enjoy :)   Maybe next time I will request a LOT of heat on my stuff and then it will be different.",

We received better service from both our waiter and our teppanyaki cook this second time around. However, it should not take a poor experience to receive a good one. I believe and always have that there is ok such thing as a VIP table/ guest as everyone deserves star treatment when they decide to go out and pawns their money on not just good food but a memorable experience. Thank you to the manager and staff for attending to us and making sure it was done right but please remember that it should be like that every time.",

They are great for small events like birthdays, anniversaries, etc.    The food is always and will forever be over priced and slow to get on your plate.  The chefs have dialed it back over the years, however they still put on a decent show.  Don't skip the fried rice, it's delicious.  I promise not to go back because of the over priced average food and slow wait service .... yet.... I will inevitably find myself back at the hibachi table for my grandmothers next birthday... :/",

    "text": "Where do I start? This is the worst experience I have ever came across with this company. It was terrible from the start and continued on to the finish.  First, I had a reservation for 7:45 and arrived with my girlfriend at approx 7:30. We were told it would be about 10 minutes (which is acceptable as we were early for our reservation), but ended up not being sat until 8:15. I had approached the host stand numerous times asking the progress for when it would be our turn. Every response was \"You are the next table! We are just setting it up\". Meanwhile, I would watch a couple more tables be sat... without me. The fact that I was forced to have a late dinner, along with being pulled along to stay was very rude and unnecessary.  Next, my server, Tania, was absolute garbage for many reasons. To start, I had to BEG for her to come around and fill my empty water glass that eventually had no ice due to her lack of urgency. As she was taking the order, she asked if I wanted the fried rice which was cooked by the chef or something else. I stated I wanted brown rice when everyone got their fried entree. Not only did I not receive my rice until 80% of the way through my entire meal (30 minutes after fried rice was served), but when I asked for soy sauce she did not supply me with some until several minutes later. In fact, she came by the table to clear plates in the meantime and I had to AGAIN remind her for my needs. It was actually humorous as to how bad her service was, considering it was a relatively slow night for the restaurant. Yes she was nice, but man was she inconsiderate at my needs as a customer.  Moving on, I get the check, which I also gave her my coupon for coming in on my birthday. She redid the total balance and gave me my revised check. The total was correct than and I, being a prior employee for 3 years in the restaurant industry, tipped her over 20% on the amount before any discounts applied knowing this is her form of income. I left and was happy to be out of there and finally have food in my stomach.  Now the nightmare begins. As my total (before tip) was roughly $33ish dollars, and after tip just under $50, I get an email from Chase, my banking provider, stating I was charged well over $130. By the time I got home and noticed the screw up the store was closed and I figured I would call in the morning to have it resolved.  In my hunt to get my bill adjusted properly, I had talked to some female manager on duty who was far from friendly. She told me that what I was charged was correct and that I am \"crazy\" for claiming I was charged over $130. She was beyond rude, arrogant, and overall left a terrible taste in my mouth to ever come back. I than had no other choice to call my bank who is now disputing my charge as Benihana could care less about the mistake that took part on their employees account. I am currently still getting it resolved, out of the additional funds they made a mistake on, and had no urge for reimbursement from them. All I want is to be charged the total I came in and dined in for but I guess in the world of Benihana, and the female manager in particular that is too much to ask.   I will never go back to this location as they are unkind, disrespectful, careless, and beyond rude.   On a final note, do not order shrimp from this location. My girlfriend and I were very uncomfortable with eating their dish as it was uncleaned shrimp and contained the black string of you know what in their contents. Very gross, but honestly after my experience with them yesterday and now today, I am not surprised.   Overall stay away from Chandler Benihana, you will do yourself a favor. Terrible store, ran by terrible \"leaders\".",

So tonight we went here knowing it may be a hours wait so we got there at 4:55 pm. They open for dinner at 5. When we walked in the place was empty and they still quoted us a hour. We waited the full hour in the bar ($57.00 for two MaiTai and 2 house wines). After the hour was up we asked how long the wait was and they said \"your Edward right?\" I replied no John and that is when they let me know they dropped us off the list. They did not know why we were no longer on the list. The only thing they could say was \" we don't know why this happens but it will now be another 35 to 45 min. I had let them know my whole party was there at 5 and we would wait the full hour in the bar.   Needless to say I'm done trying this location. I also saw 4 other parties leave as soon as they walked in and got such a long wait time quote. All of this happened when the restaurant was 65 to 75% empty!!!  Fire the hosts or manager ASAP. It really seems like the host was doing everything to keep people from filling up the restaurant.",

We got seated and comfortable, and then we were asked to move to accommodate other people joining the table. Umm..ok.   Our waiter, Zach, was either new or inexperienced, or both. The other party had to ask for their drink three times. He forgot about my fiances sushi roll that he ordered, and finally brought it out 30 minutes later..WARM! Then managed to take the wrong ice cream order that my fiance requested..and to top it off never took our picture (they are always supposed to). Overall, very slow and inattentive.   Our cook, Saul, was mediocre. Nothing special. Certainly did not entertain or connect with any of us at the table.   The food was also mediocre. Definitely not worth the price. Nothing comes out at the same time. Which makes absolutely no sense. Why would you cook the rice, serve it,then the veggies, meat, and then a side of onions? All were served 10+ minutes apart. Makes zero sense.   Sigh. Never again.",

I made reservations approximately 2 weeks ago to ensure we get a table on this special day. I made the reservation for 6 pm and arrive here at 5:45 and checked in with the front desk. We kept noticing people walking in after us being seated and we were just curious as to why they were getting seated and we haven't even been called upon. I gave them several minutes assuming since it was Mother's Day they might have just been a bit backed up. But once 6:30 hit I started to make my way to the desks and asked what was going on. The lady asked what my name was an she looks at her screen and leans to the other girl next to her and asked why hadn't we been seated yet. Needles to say they over looked my name and never called us, with that being said they squeezed other people in our place. So after we waited another while so they could find us a table, we didn't get seated till 6:40. Once we sat down we didn't see the waiter till 6:54 to ask us about drinks. I'm still here sitting patiently waiting on our drinks parched as can be. I guess we will see what happens next. Just figured I'd write about my experience while I'm sitting here waiting......................",

When we got there we waited 30min to be seated, I understand a wait for no reservation, But that was not our case I had planned this in advance and still had to wait. Once we were finally seated it took another 35min for someone to take our order. As I was placing my order I had pulled our waitress aside to let her know that it was my sons birthday, she then proceeded to ask \"can I say happy birthday\" in an obvious and loud manner. We then spoke with the hostess to make sure our waitress understood we wanted the birthday experience (song, ice cream etc). When our chef came to the table he was great, very interactive and the food was good. That was probably the only enjoyable part of our night. As we finished our meals we were waiting for the birthday experience. Nothing! The other family at our table had left and our party of 3 sat there waiting another 30 min for a song, desert, even our bill! Our waitress finally came by and we again had to remind her we had a birthday. She looked at us like it was the first time she heard that, unbelievable! We gave her one more chance and told her yes we'd like the ice cream and song. Again another 10-20 min passed and we got up to leave, we'll guess who was making her way back as we were walking to the door. We skipped the song, had our ice cream and left as soon as we could.  I'm very disappointed with the services from Benihana- and what made it worse is that we chose this place for my sons birthday. They had done nothing special for him. It's safe to say my family and I will never go to Benihana again and this is our first time going to this location.",

    "text": "I love Benihana's, their food is always delicious. However, my recent visit to this particular location was a complete disaster.   I had made a reservation for 8:00 pm on a Thursday night. I arrived at the restaurant early by 7:30 pm and was followed by the rest of my party arriving by 7:45 pm. I made sure to let the hostess know that my entire party and I were present, which prompted her to respond that we will be sat shortly. Fast forward to 8:00 pm when I check in with the hostess again, and again am told it'll be about 10 minutes. Another 10 minutes go by so I check in again, and was still told that they would seat us when they were ready. My party and I were finally sat around 8:30 pm. The waitress quickly got us our drinks, but then completely disappeared. By 8:50 pm, after no staff member has approached our table since us being sat, I went back up to the hostess and asked what was going on and where the waitress and chef were... I was again told they would be there shortly. By 9:05 pm my party and I still had not even been served soup or salad. By this point we were considering leaving, especially since we were celebrating my birthday that night. I pulled aside a random server and asked what the issue was, he was pleasant and understood my frustration. He went to talk to a manager and came back and said it would still be about another 15 minutes. Which it was. My party and I did not end up even being able to eat until 9:45 pm. No manager ever came to apologize. No discount was offered. No one ever acknowledged just how long I had to wait.   Because of this experience I will more than likely NEVER be back to this location. And I advise others, even with a reservation, if you are not okay with waiting 2+ hours to eat, STAY AWAY.",

We didn't get the birthday service. They also rushed us out at the end, and the people next to us felt like they had to leave. So, they asked if we were being rushed out and then asked for boxes to pack up. I've been to several of these locations throughout the states, and this was the least satisfying. We tipped our cook handsomely but we were disappointed in everything else.",

We only went because we were treated to a meal, but upon entering realized it was overpriced for the yucky atmosphere!  I will compliment the staff for their polite and kind demeanors, but everything else was really disappointing and the bathrooms were frankly disturbing. Sticky floors to the point where I had to consciously use a great deal of effort to walk, and the sinks and toilets were LESS clean than a hole-in-the wall gas station! Obviously hadn't been cleaned properly in many many months! We paid $100 dollars for less than impressive steak and seafood that was seasoned with nothing more than salt and pepper and then dipped in bland sauces that were OK at best.   I admit the Father's Day pictures were a nice gift but after dropping $100 and feeling nervous with how dirty the restaurant and the staff looked, it was the least they could do.  I Do not recommend this restaurant! Please do not support this place or refer it to friends. Dirty, overpriced and disappointing! Should be out of business!",

She took forever to take out orders.  Just not the quality of service you expect from Benihana.   We come here for most of our birthdays and sadly this one was not enjoyable.  Even the guests we invited to dinner mentioned the service was subpar.    Thankfully, the chef was very fun and saved the evening from 1star.  We tipped him directly to insure he was not subjected to her poor service.      I think we'll be moving our birthday celebrations to another restaurant.      After 2hrs 15min we decided to skip the singing and ice cream and head home.  I hope things improve,  but at this point in time I cant recommend you visit.",

After they sang to us they brought out ice cream for just the birthday person, no ice cream was offered to the kids which I'm not sure if their menu has changed but the children used to always get ice as well as the 6 course meal which was what my husband got. Was also disappointed that the customary photo taken during special occasions wasn't even offered, again I'm not sure if it's changed since the last time we where here which was in April but we where a bit annoyed to be rushed during our meal.",

    "text": "08/18 and 08/19  Came to check out Benihana's happy hour and sat at the bar.  One bartender was more eager than the other to answer my questions regarding my food issues, but both were gracious and friendly.  I wondered if they split the tips evenly?  Tried a few plates...  Some were 50% off, and some were slightly reduced.  The menu pricing was a little confusing, and I hope that this is corrected in the near future.  The seaweed salad was OK.  Don't know if I would pay the full price of $3.75, though.  (And for 50%, or was it $3?, I don't think it was worth that, either.)  The gyoza was also just OK- a bit on the bland side and a bit lacking on the mouth-feel aspect.  The asparagus tempura plate was a nice surprise; However, the greasiness got to me, and in the end, I was stripping the batter off of the spears more due to necessity, and not w/ the sadness I normally would be feeling from having to trim off delightful cruchiness, bec. otherwise I couldn't enjoy the meal knowing I'd ingested all of that excess oil!  The tuna sashimi was very good and substantial, compared to all of the \"light\" apps that I tasted before it.  The spicy yellowtail was also very nice, although the jalapenos were a bit too much, so I just scooped them off to the side.  Really liked the acidic component of this dish!  With all the HH reductions, I wasn't thrilled w/ this meal, but at least I know which to revisit and which to pass next time.  Lunch was also a bit disappointing.  Both lunch boat and duet came w/ many components, but Mom and I only truly enjoyed the salad, the chicken (it was good, although I couldn't eat much of it), the salmon sashimi, and the runaway hit, beef julienne (both off of the boat).  Since these came, for the most part, in two-bite portions, we didn't feel like we received our money's worth.    Looking back, I know we won't be returning any time soon.",

Since it was our first-ever visit to Benihana, we had the old stereotype image of serious chefs tossing deadly knives in the air.  Our chef wasn't quite as aggressive, using more blunt cooking utensils, but he was really good at it, and pretty funny as well - very good entertainment.  We had a group of 12, but they wouldn't seat us until I could explain why a couple were not there and might or might now show later.  I just don't get that (anywhere, not just here).  We were at one table, so it's not like we were going to hold a table hostage and not eat if they didn't show.  Nonetheless, we had a great time and will probably go back again.",

Last I was there the service in the sushi lounge was poor, the entree I ordered in the sushi lounge was nothing like what you would get at a hibachi grill. The chicken was rubbery and tough and had some spicy sauce lazily drizzled on top it wasn't even cooked in it. The sauces have diminished over the years to being bitter runny goo and the dressing isn't much better. Wish they would get their act together and return to their former glory. I have forgiven them time and time again, even when one meal I had sand in my salad but I'm kind of saddened that I won't be returning until something changes. Also worth mentioning my friend was there a week ago and there was a large cockroach crawling on the floor inside the dining room.",

    "text": "Last night I went to the Benihana in Chandler for my birthday. It was the worst experience I have ever had a Benihana and I felt as if I had to write in. It wasn't my first visit, I have been there many many many times. I have a group of friends and we all go when its our birthday. We fill up a table each time. Last year my sister had a baby and as such we've had to adjust the time we normally go. I made a reservation for 5:15pm so she could come and it wouldn't interrupt my 1 year old nephews routine (and he would be in good spirits because as much as I love him I know that kids are emotional sometimes). All 6 people in our party left work early so we would all be on time. My sister and brother in law were waiting in the bar when I got to the restaurant. They had been there since 5 and the bar was empty expect for two tables.  They hadn't even been greeted by the bar tender for the 10 minutes they had been there before me. I checked in with the hostess at 5:15pm and she said it would be a few minutes so I went to the bar to order drinks. After about 10 minutes of being ignored by the bartender, I finally caught her attention and she snapped at me \"I'm the only one here in the bar, I'll help you when I can!\".  Finally able to get a drink, we were starting to wonder how much longer for the table. At 5:35,  with the incredibly rude hostess, in an almost completely EMPTY restaurant, we finally walked back up and asked how much longer we would be waiting. The two girls had been mainly ignoring the guests and talking to each other and the lone male host. They weren't smiling, or friendly, or nice in any way shape or form. We were told ,rudely, that it would be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes after that, with my nephew getting antsy, I walked up and said that we need a table (in the now still half empty restaurant and full lobby). She said they would be sitting us 'right now'. I verified that it was in fact 'right now, right now, not right now in another 15 minutes.' And she said yes. My two sisters had walked outside to keep my nephew busy and I brought her back inside, and I pulled our other 3 people from the bar (who had been buying drinks and appetizers). We stood waiting in the lobby another 10 minutes. A full 50 minutes after we had checked in on time we were finally shown to our table. Where our waitress asked if this was our first visit. We told her that we were old pros but she still felt it necessary to go over the ENTIRE menu with us and ignored us trying to tell her that we even knew what we wanted to order. We wanted to get our order in so my sister could actually eat dinner before she had to leave since it had taken us SO long to be seated. The restaurant wasn't full at all and yet the waitresses service was still so slow and she ignored us so often that we ended up stacking our own used dishes up off to the side. She didn't even refill our drinks. My sister had to leave without even eating her meal. Her husband stayed behind to bring it home for her. We finally had to flag our waitress down for our checks and she forgot to use my coupon so we had to flag her down again. We gave her our cards and she forgot to run one of them so we had to flag her down again to run it.    I have a lot of sympathy for service (especially during the holiday season) but it was the attitude of the hostesses and the lack of involvement from the manager that really upsets me. The manager (who kept walking by the hostess desk) didn't bother to talk to the girls who weren't seating people in a restaurant that was empty! The reason we made such early reservations was so that my sister and my nephew could have dinner with us. I know that my group and I have decided to not go to Benihana's anymore after last night. Had it been only one person with a bad attitude, we would have absolutely been forgiving but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I won't be going back.  **Update in response to the company contacting me, I had actually emailed their customer service first. But didn't hear anything back. It appears that Yelp is monitored more often than the customer service email?",

I figured an old chain restaurant like this would be resting on it's laurels and really crummy. What a surprise!   It's a four star \"experience\" with three star food and fun/interestig/good service.   Food - It's fresh and nicely cooked but that's it. This is not a foodie restaurant. But if you are a foodie and you don't want to eat crappy food, this is a nice substitute.   Service- Very congenial, prompt and FUN. We sat at a cook table, and why else would you go here? We were seated with a young couple who had two tiny kids who were rambunctious and loud. And again.. that's the kind of place this is. So be prepared to actually deal with other people. if you want quiet go somewhere else.   Our cook chef was amazing. Really talented and charming. Made the experience wonderful.   It's different and fun, with nice people, nice service and decent food.",

My bill was almost $200 for three people and two were children!! Very disappointed in the service and the quality of the food. The chef didn't even bother to cut off the fat from my meat which ended up being over a 1/4 of the steak. (They don't give you knives). They don't serve egg yolk sauce either but the waiter told me they had it and would bring it out. Won't be returning to this location nor this chain. Japanese Steak House is a million times better. They care about their reputation and it shows in their customer service as well as the quality of their menu items. Don't waste your time or money at Benihana/Chandler.",

Benihana's has a dress code which this man was obviously not adhering to but his gun flopping around on his hip made our family (with young children) feel very unsafe. I am surprised they allow firearms in their establishment. We went in regardless. Made a reservation for our family but Waited 10+ minutes to be seated with another family. Unfortunately we were seated with the man carrying the gun so we decided to leave.  I support your right to open carry but please be responsible and to Benihana's I would suggest enforcing some safety codes along with that dress code you don't seem to care much about.",

We also order the Benihana special for teppan.   The sushi always taste fresh and delicious. It was my first time getting the Hibachi steak  and lobster, both had a lot of flavor. It's  seasoned with butter, salt, pepper, and Japanese butter.   They accidentally gave us the wrong sushi roll so we got one for free, that was pretty cool.

Here, my first time visiting this place was an epic tragedy.  As I walked in, the hostess was smiling and had a bubbly personality and was cordial. I was told it was self seating, so I found a nice little table all to myself.  My waitress is a whole other story.   She didn't greet me or ask how I was doing, instead she dropped to different menus and asked, \"Just you?\"  \"Yes.\"  She took away the other place setting and walked away.  No smile. It looked like she was pissed. Perhaps it was permanent resting B---- face.  She came back and quickly asked what I would like to drink. Tea of course.  Tea came out and then the big question, \"you want to order now?\"  Good news, I'm in a really good mood and I wasn't going to let this persons mood get to me.  I ordered for the lunch menu and asked that my steak be rare.  Soup arrived, it was good. Nothing that blew my palette. I did asked for a little wasabi and added a little piece of it to add a slight kick to the broth.  When my plate arrived, I saw immediately that the beef was fully cooked.   I did not bother the waitress to have it sent back (yes, I'm that nice of a customer and not petty).  Even the manager came to ask how was everything, I didn't have the heart to tell him that my waitress forgot to bring her personality with her to work.  Now, the table next to me, I have to say, made me a little jealous. Their waitress was smiling, she attentive, and anticipated her guests needs like bringing extra napkins, took away the chopstick wrappers off the table, etc...  Overall, the food was not what I remembered, it was just okay.  Ultimately, the service with my waitress was a horrible experience. I still tipped her and have her feedback, I let her know she didn't even look at my steak to notice that it was fully cooked - not rare, and still proceeded to serve it to me. I also said it would help if you smiled at your customers. Besides myself, she had three other tables and she was the same with them.  You may have a different encounter than I did, I will say, customer service here is like. Roulette game!  #GoodLuck! :)",

I ordered the hibachi Filet that came with the five courses. The soup, salad, rice, veggies, and meat. Oh, and a small amount of shrimp for an appetizer.   Now maybe I'm spoiled because I'm used to Kobe's steakhouse when I lived in FL and NY. I have yet to find another Kobe style steakhouse that's good on its own let alone as good as an actual Kobe's   This place is no exception. The soup was good.  The salad was not. The dressing had to much of a ginger taste. Obviously subjective. You might like it. The rice was very overlooked and bland. Same with the veggies and the shrimp. My wife said the same thing. It just had no taste at all.   The Filet was a different story. It was excellent. I don't know how the cook went from making everything tasteless to making the Filet perfect but he did.   Speaking of the cook on to the service. Is was very good. Our experience was a bit long (two hours) but they were busy so that's to be expected. They were professional and courteous. The cook did his part to be \"funny\". He wasn't bad.   Having said all of that I'll never go back. One, the bill for everything was $100 and like I said 90% of the food was tasteless. Our drinks were good. I'll give them that.   The other reason is their posted signs. One you see outside basically says they do checks on everyone they hire and the won't hire illegals. Only Americans and immigrants here with a work Visa. You know, the proper way to do it. Not sneak in and stick your hand out for free stuff and demand rights.   That sign was excellent. The anti gun sign was not. And that's why I'll never go back. I'm not going to bring my family into a victim zone. Criminals simply do not play by the rules. I'm baffled that anti gunners actually believe signs and gun control laws work. They don't. Criminals don't care about signs and laws.   And the only other reason not to allo guns is to not \"offend\" the anti's. I'm sorry but who cares about the feelings of people who are so naive they are basically children in grown up bodies. It's time to stop placating the children who's gun knowledge comes from Hollywood and agenda driven politicians and anti gun groups funded by Soros and Bloomberg.   The restaurants that post these signs should be held accountable if a criminal comes in with a guns and hurts people. It's not like this already doesn't occur. Restaurants have to follow rules and codes so people who visit don't get hurt. Bad food. Poor construction. Basically a restaurant can't fall into disrepair and hurt someone. So how is it different if the owners willing create a place where patrons have no defense against a bad person with a weapon?    It's time to stop supporting places that do this. It's time to punish restaurants who cater to criminals and naive \"grown ups\".",

    "text": "This is probably my sixth time visiting this teppanyaki restaurant. Why do I keep coming back? Certainly not the food nor the high price.  I come here because of the show that keeps the kids entertained and allows the adults to hang out for a leisurely two hour dinner.  Depending on your chef, the experience can be less than stellar.  We were lucky to have a True entertainer, Kevin, who added another star to this review.    Reservations for 11 at 730pm, we were seated at 750pm.   Service was very slow, as usual .  We ordered salmon, lobster, shrimp, steak, scallops, chicken, fried rice along with the soup, salad, edamame, and green tea.  Ginger and mustard sauces were given to everyone.   The tap water is not filtered or the filter needs to be changed.  They provide lemon wedges to mask the taste.  The lobster, as usual, was tough and chewy.  The salmon comes out overcooked due to the high heat of the grill.  The fried rice, mushrooms, and onions were all tasty having been spiced up with Salt, pepper, butter, and soy sauce.    I ordered sherbet, the server made sure to tell me there was an additional charge.   Our bill was in excess of $450 dollars.    We were  overcharged, they charged us for my sons meal twice.   Food / service 2.5 stars  Kevin / chef / entertainer 4 stars Cost 2 stars  I keep coming back though.",

To be honest, I don't really care for the whole teppanyaki experience. It is a novel idea but it gets old after seeing it for every family birthday. Thanks sir, but no offense to you but I've seen the flaming volcano before.  The food is all over the board as far as quality goes. Sometimes you get a good mix and other times it is just OK. I've never had bad food at any teppanyaki restaurant, but don't expect the food to knock your socks off. This place is about the experience over the food.  The chefs are normally pretty good. If they hate their job, they they always put on a good face and put on a solid show for everyone. Good on them... or maybe I'm simply the only one that hates my job?  Is probably give this place a 3.5, but I can't do that here so I'll round up. OK food on the grill. OK sushi. Expensive (I got one roll and an adult beverage and it cost me 25) as all hell. Overall fun experience.",

    "text": "I am so dissapointed in Benihana Chandler. Last night 6 of us dined there for 3 Birthday Celebrations and shared a table with a couple who was also celebrating a Birthday. We had a 715pm reservation, got seated on time, got a Chef at 845pm. Our waiter came at 830pm n said that his Manager is giving free appetizers for the wait, this is after we had our Soup n Salad. Around this time we let the server know that two guests found hair in their soup, he said the Manager will be over to discuss. The Manager never came so my friend flagged him down to inform him n he disregarded her complaint and walked off. We found out that this was the District Manager.  He never comes back as requested. Our Chef comes rushing us through the service because he says there's only 5 Chefs for the whole restaurant and he's being yelled at in the back to quickly finish our meal. Burned food, not enough rice prepared, waiter was overwhelmed and I blame Management. Instead of seating more tables they should have delayed others reservations or turned people away. Three out of six of us was first n last time guests. We got 15% off the bill but that's not sufficient at all. The Chefs portion of the meal is the main attraction n Benihana Chandler failed last night.",

I felt it was very mediocre. The food didn't have much flavor and lacked salt. Of course, there is no salt on the table.  My favorite part of steak anywhere is the steak sauce. They have no steak sauce. None. Period. Finally they serve Pepsi products and I'm a Coke fan. Just wasn't at all what I expected. The chef was fun, entertaining and funny, but we just paid $175 for four people to have dinner!",

When you go through the trouble of planning for an event, making a reservation, you would expect at the very least that a table would be ready when you arrive at the designated time with your party. Not the case.  And, the hostess lacks customer service skills.  No eye contact, no caring attitude.  And, really, why do all of the employees congregate at the hostess stand?  In this case probably because of the complete incompetence of the hostess, certainly not because of her warm demeanor.  After being pushed aside and ignored for 20 minutes, we left.  Don't waste your time here, it us as enjoyable as being stuck in a traffic jam.",

    "text": "The decor/lighting at this Chandler location leaves a lot to be desired but aside from that, it's a perfectly adequate experience for a teppanaki-style dinner.  It's always more enjoyable with a lively group but the cooks are always entertaining, in a cheesy, G-rated kind of way.  As for the food, I agree that the SUSHI here is always tasty but I've gotten rolls where the rice wasn't sticky and the roll fell apart (never a good thing). Sashimi always tasted fresh and a decent portion for the price.  I always upgrade to the Fried Rice and I recommend eating it right after it comes off the grill; otherwise, there's not much difference from the local Panda chain. The seafood/steak combinations are best but everyone knows that grilling shrimp/scallops/lobster is the quickest way to dry out/overcook seafood so it's never as enjoyable as sauteed or steamed seafood. But, alas, it's the experience of having it cooked in front of you that brings people back and that's probably why I go back 2-3 times a year.",

Scott, our white but swears he's the brother of a Japanese chef, was cool.  Prices are high, to be expected with high end meat and seafood.  And yes, we must always upgrade to the chicken fried rice.  I love the ginger sauce over the mustard based sauce.  It has a nice tang and goes well with everything.  Your chef will give you more if you happen to use all of yours over the fried rice as I did.  I recommend going with 8 people.  Take the whole table and take all for yourselves.  I suggest any meat and seafood combo.  i recommend upgrading to the fried rice.  And if you have a whimsical side, get the drink that comes in a ceramic Buhdda.  Cheers.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to one of these places where the food is actually cooked in front of you.  Ultimately, it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works, but it kind of backfires:  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price.     The layout here is kind of weird.  Forget anything intimate--I was kind of fearing the placement of our largely dysfunctional get together near the rather normal couple, but it worked out well enough.   Problems arise in the layout of the place--everybody faces out a window with the majority having their backs to the entrances (I hate that).  The \"view\" is a massive parking lot bookended by a La-Z-Boy store and a Chili's.  Switching the layout of the place might have been a small salvation.    What you're really getting is the cooking show, worthy of a sixth star:  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked.    But it's not a grand luxury, it's just Eastern efficiency.  You don't wait for your food, they don't have to hire expos, and they need less kitchen infrastructure.  As soon as the food is done, it's on your plate--the tradeoff of the show as I would have liked to have it all out at the same time.   Something is slightly taken away from it when the other chef on the other table does the train sound again with his butcher knife; It feels like a pre-programmed repertoire to go with the pre-programmed food.  This is why chains leave me bitter, even good ones like Benihana.     The ingredients are nothing special--for a table of 7 they bust out a few zucchinis, a couple handfuls of generic white mushrooms, a couple white onions, small slabs of steak and chicken, etc.  What really gives this place its Denny's-plus quality was immediately apparent in the side salad--a bag of store bought mix and a couple tomatoes.  It appears to add up to a lot of food, but I've spent less at other restaurants and usually bring home a box.    The sauces they use are what saves the place food wise, but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot, at all.  On the other hand, the two ginger sauces, a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, this place severely loses on price and service.  The server was basically gone the whole time.  Fuck her.  She splits her tip with the awesome chef and drags his performance down.    At one point I got up and went back to the front end to ask for the bathroom, waiting impatiently for the hostess to finish chatting with a friend who came in with another table.  What the hell?  The bathroom itself was a sticky-floored mess--something I would expect at Veterans Memorial Coliseum or some douchebag bar, not a place that charges this much for dinner.  Drinks were extremely expensive, charging $9 for a 22-oz bottle of beer.     The magic here is the presentation, the sauce, and the overall delivery, but it's severely hampered by food quality, prices, and poor service.  It would have been two stars, but I couldn't be angry at the place after having such wonderful ice cream and a picture (scantly offered as it were) at the end.    Overall, Benihana is worth the one-time experience but needs significant improvement to happily lure me back as a repeat customer.",

    "text": "I went with my friend for his birthday. He ordered 12 oz New York and I ordered the 8 oz tenderloin. I knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like. I meant business when it comes to steak!!   Our cook prepped our food in front of us, I noticed how each steak has different cut, while NY was chunky and short, my tenderloin was thinner. While I turned around in middle of the conversation, the steak was served onto my plate, and the first thing I noticed was how chunky it was. After trying the first bite, I know immediately that was NOT a tenderloin. Just to make sure, I tried a piece of what was served to my friend, and I noticed my \"tenderloin\" was chewy and lean (what NY steak  normally taste like) while his \"NY steak\" was soft and fatty (what tenderloin normally taste like.)   I brought this to the manager's attention, he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if I requested to have my steak cooked with Garlic butter. I informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat/ garlic butter makes all the difference. (Keep in mind, my friend also didn't request the garlic butter.)  Lastly, he walked away with \"But I will see what I can do\" and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table. I left my steak untouched simply cause I wasn't sure if they will correct my order... And end up leaving the place $40 short and hungry.   I feel I was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully.  I wasn't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly. Though getting me what I ordered correctly would be nice (which didn't happen), an apology would be highly appreciated (which also didn't happen.)   As much as I love tepanyaki, I will NEVER return to this location.",

    "text": "My husband and I had never been to Benihana but I had been told by some former co-workers that they do a special birthday promotion if you register online so we went ahead and did that and ended up going for my husband's birthday dinner. Initially we had gone on, I believe, a Tuesday evening and it was pretty packed so we opted to make reservation for the next day and just come back. Off the bat, the seating is NOT my cup of tea. I understand it's communal because they cook in front of you on those big grill tables which can fit a ton of people but I am not outgoing at all and if you get the wrong table neighbors, you're in for a world of uncomfortable small talk. We were sat next to a very nice family who was also celebrating a birthday and I could just tell the wife wanted us to be more engaging but sis, we weren't even here for that kind of party. Our waitress was super sweet; I wish I could remember her name because she was on it. Our chef was funny too, he wasn't showing off as much as some of the chefs around us but I get it, he's just a laid back kind of guy. Everyone stressed to me how good the fried rice would be and how it was worth the upcharge and while I do agree it was worth the upcharge, it really was just basic chicken fried rice. If I recall correctly, I got the Benihana special and my husband got the hibachi steak. The cook on the steaks and the lobster was definitely over and everything was so salty, too too much soy sauce. It was just a miss for us. My husband said he's glad we tried it but he does not want to go back but I think I'd go back for Happy Hour or maybe treat my younger brother for his birthday since it's a fun experience. I think I'll probably try a different location next time.",

My sushi rolls seemed to be unraveled when they came to my table. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bothered by the bartender singing loudly behind the bar.

Not sure if he was new but nothing he made was good. The fried rice had no flavor and we had to add soy sauce just to make it edible. Most of the group got filet and chicken. The chicken was so dry it was like eating beef jerky and had no flavor. The filet was cooked good but again zero flavor. No one in are group even ate it. On top of that it was so freaking hot in there. I understand there is a lot of cooking going on but we literally sweat the whole time we where inside the restaurant. Are waiter knew something was wrong because nobody ate any of the food so he called over the manager. I explained what happened and told her that the cook was not pleasant and the food was barely edible. She did take like 50 dollars off the bill but we still paid 200 dollars for food we did not eat. We actually left the restaurant and went to another one because everyone was still hungry. Please avoid this place you will thank me.",

Our food order was taken about 7:10 pm.  I sat and watched my tiny little yellowtail roll die in the window for almost 30 minutes while the waiter was missing in action.  He would disappear for a minimum of 15 minutes at a time.  The soup and salad finally came.  The soup was barely luke warm.  It was so full of fried onion strips that I could not force it down.  The broth was very bland and the mushrooms were raw due to the cold temperature. The salad dressing was terrible, as well.  It was like cold shredded ginger root with a dash of sugar and vinegar.  Our teppan chef was a big dud.  He was very robotic and disinterested.  The food was only mediocre.  Nothing like what Benihana used to be.  I ordered the Land and Sea, which is filet mignon and scallops.  The dish was just over $38 and I received 5 tiny little scallops no bigger around than a quarter.  I was very disappointed as was my dining companion.  I will not make the mistake of going to this place again.  It was over $100 for two people for very mediocre food and terrible service.  We did not get out of the place until after 8:30 pm.",

Once seated, our waitress came over to take our drinks and appetizer orders.  Drinks and appetizers came out quickly and we all placed our orders..   Las Vegas roll Sashimi platter   Two Benihana trios Hibachi steak Spicy hibachi steak Rockys steak and shrimp Kids steak and shrimp   The Las Vegas roll was so good! Dip it in the soy sauce and bam, party in your mouth! I kinda wanted to just eat the Vegas roll all night long!   Okay, so the food is pretty simple. You get rice, (either steamed white or chicken fried rice) and of course a protein or proteins. My Benihana trio consisted of shrimp, steak, and chicken with the chicken fried rice. It was a five course meal so we also got a soup to start with and then came the salad, then the rice, shrimp appetizer, our meats, mushrooms, and then our onions. The only ingredients they seem to use are garlic butter, garlic, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Nothing too fancy but the flavor is good.  All in all, what your really paying for is for the experience and the food is just what you get from it. We spent about $200 for a party of 8 so it can be pricey, but hey they put on a good show!",

Don't order the combo plates as the portion size of the seafood was for kids. The fried rice wasn't edible. The shrimp was over cooked and 4 little pieces was laughable at best. $160 for two people between a drink, appetizers, and dinner was disheartening to say the least.

My family went Thursday night and just walking in the door it was obvious that something was very different. It usually has lots of people cheering their chefs performance and clapping etc. It was very quiet other than the wait staff singing g happy birthday. The usually smiling faces at the chef tables were all stern stone faced. There was a lot of disappointment. I started to be concerned but hey this was Benihana's they just must be difficult to please right? WRONG!! I have never been disappointed here before. Well the chef we got was depressing complaining about how other people complained about him, well he deserved it. Everything everyone ordered was so over cooked it was bordering burnt. The only thing cooked properly was the steak. The lobster, shrimp, sea scallops and chicken were rubber. The fried rice bordered on crispy it was so over done and dried out. The chef chopped all our meat to the size of peas so you didn't even taste it it was like having rubber peas in your food. Then he cooked up three thin length wise slices of zucchini and 5 slices of onion and about 7 mushrooms that was all cooked and chopped to bits and then decided by 7 people. Then as he gave us our meat (aka rubber bits) the server came around the table to tell everyone they ran out of steamed white rice would they like brown rice or wait, everyone chose to wait as brown rice is very chewy and sticky. Then the manager shows up at our table with bowls of brown rice and tells everyone it is good for you and to eat it. One person tried it made a face and waited for the white rice like the rest of us. It came after we were all pretty much finished eating. The food was just bad the seasoning consisted of copious amounts of soy sauce. Yuk! The evening was ruined and sad to say my nearly 15 years as a customer has ended. NEVER AGAIN at approximately $30 a plate we felt totally ripped off! The pathetic soup was the best part of the meal.",

You do not get that place by simply meeting needs and doing what is expected. You honestly do not even get that place by going a little above and beyond. Timothy is a reflection of the most exceptional customer service because in the face of adversity and extreme abuse from our table mates, he not only kept his cool he responded with a level of kindness that is uncommon! Timothy not only displayed phenomenal customer service he exemplified beyond what is typical leadership skills and patience. I genuinely hope that he gets the accolades that he deserves. Believe me when I say had you been at that table and witnessed the abuse and the most exemplary response to that abuse you would be asking the restaurant to be named after him. Amazing job Timothy. If they allow you to read this just remember how those people decided to treat you says far more about them then it could ever say about you.",

I like good food, and good service together, I used to come, because my kiddo liked the show, she was little. I thought the food tasteless and unedible. but we had fun, the sad part is the service is ALWAYS HORRIBLE tonight no exception. I am far to tired to get into it, but OH MY GAWD oddly enough the food has much less \"crud\" on it, basic steak salt pepper YUMMY, I used to feel guilty saying I need less salt etc... soy on the steak blah, and tonight yippy, but our server was on drugs or just plain and simply put an idiot, I nearly left twice, I  decided to stay had fun, chatting and taking pics. my sushi was made wrong, I ordered first, so it came last and it was wrong, which makes me want to say forget it, but they bring it, and it's wrong again, I say this isn't what I ordered and blonde person claiming to be a server says no they changed the menu, bam she is gone. I ask for paper napkins, bam I never see her, other servers walk by over and over ignoring me and my Voice CARRY\"S! I have sushi after the chef arrived, They came with the Birthday  stuff, but for this kid at the table next to us, I had my birthday certificate open on the table the entire time, she says\" I asked if anyone was celbrating\" OH MY GAWD I then get a 45 dollar bill that says 78  ... she stands there arguing with me, I called Manager , he fixed it, and didn't fight,   I also usually bring cash , but last I was there they put a manditory 18 percent tip. and I was giving the waiter cash, and the chef cash, and then bam i notice the 18 percent gratuity , I can't say give me back the tip, so I tell manager, and he took it off. GRRRR so I figured it was a manditory tip, well it isn't anymore, so I tipped 15.00 cuz I enjoyed the chef, and I suppose someone else will get part of it, but I am exhausted getting bad service, I am not too thrilled the food was good, because what is the point if you have to fight for a napkin, the right food, and of course a lousy candle in some ice cream, (My 11 year old was disappointed on me. ya know) I worked for tips my entire life, and let me tell you, I have been known to tip like mad for great service, imagine if I tipped 15 for this LOUSY SERVICE~ We might be back next year for something, but I won't miss them if I don't go. GRRRRRRRRRR  Training for chefs a must, why not train servers, or is managment to blame cuz  they all look like the worst, ignoring me etc etc I finally got those napkins after begging PLEASE!  well 3 stars makes sense if they own Ra... nuff said, next time I want sushi and service I know where I go for good food and service, and it won't be Ra or Benihana.",

I said all that to say...BUT once you get past the awkward moments, the evening at a Benihana's table for a teppanyaki meal becomes entertaining, relaxing and fun.  But it's best when you bring your own cool crew, but you probably knew that.  The food was okay for my taste, but a meal always tastes better when shared among good company. I'm just sayin...",

Our chef at this location even made a 'Mickey Mouse' out of the rice, per my daughters request, just one of the highlights.   I don't understand the negative comments or reviews regarding waiting to be seated unless the entire party is there, or sharing a table at teppanyaki. This is common practice at all locations I've ever been to.   I have learned this particular location is busier on the weekends, so I just call for reservation. If I need one great, if I don't, then I'm happy I checked. I have been during the week and reservations weren't needed, so it just depends.  I love their ginger dressing, it's not like anything I've ever had. Over the years I have even purchased it. I am a fan of shrimp and this restaurant has my favorite shrimp.   Our family will continue to come to Benihana's, as we have for many, many years. This is one of our favorite places to eat.",

I made a reservation at 7:00 and was not sat until after 7:00, strike one. We browse through the menu and we decide on our dishes. My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Rocky's choice (chicken and steak) there were two other parties sat with us (I know this is normal and I'm not upset about this) both gentleman that were also at the table both ordered the Rocky's choice as well. As the chef was cooking, he cooked two and a half chicken breasts for the 4 meals that included chicken. I'm thinking to myself that hopefully he is going to put more on the grill. He portioned out one whole chicken breast for my wife's dish which I was pleased about because it was her first time and she was really enjoying everything. He then proceeded to cube up the remaining one and a half chicken breasts for the remaining THREE chicken dishes. Strike two. I paid for a whole portion of chicken and received about a third of a chicken breast. I am highly disappointed in this restaurant and will not be returning. I did not complain as it was my anniversary and did not want an issue, but looking back I should have mentioned it because the dishes cost way too much to be served like I was. This was supposed to be a special night for my wife and I and there was nothing special about taking her to Benihana.",

    "text": "Unbelievable!  My son had the \"Be the Chef\" experience. We arrived at 4pm, and the chef (Ananda, a.k.a Smile) worked with him for over 2 hours teaching him how to cook teppan style. When I arrived for dinner with the family 2 hours later, I was handed a picture, and my son was dressed in full chef clothing with the big red hat included. I was amazed that he was given so much attention.  We were escorted to our table, as it was just for us. My son came out, did his introduction and bow. He started cooking and really did a great job. His mentor stayed within earshot, but did not hover. My 16 year old had total confidence and even made a few jokes that he had been taught. The entire time, it was as though we were given person attention. I felt as though we were the only ones in the restaurant. I could not believe how much they went out of their way for us.   After dinner, we were treated with a birthday song, desert and another picture as a family. Even Ananda was in the picture. I was amazed.  You would think that this experience would be experience would be expensive. It cost no more than just dinner. For my son to be taught and cook, it was free! Amazing!  As a single parent, outdoing the last birthday is always a challenge. This was the 16th, so it was even more special. I would have to say that the team at Benihana made our day. This was a day my son will never forget. Five stars would not be enough for all that was given to us. Benihana Chandler, you are a perfect 10!",

We had reservations and was told if we didn't arrive early our reservation would be cane led.   We waited one hour after our reservation time to be seated.   Upon being seated, it took 30 minutes to get our orders for drinks.   Another 40 minutes before cook arrived at our table to prepare food.  Not only was the food flavorless and dry, it was terrible.  The cook was had no personally and was very boring during the preparation of the food.  In addition to poor service and very poor quality of food the manager / general manager wouldn't except the birthday coupon for our grand daughter and was exceptionally rude to us about the quality of service and food.  Three hours later we left needless to say very sad we made decision to dine at Benihana.  We will tell all our friends.",

Luckily its everyday! Couldn't wait to have our massage and sushi date night!   Now, we've been to Japan, have had awesome sushi, love 202 Crazy Fish Sushi in Tempe and decided to try Benihana's...big mistake. I should've learned after we had gone to Kabuki, knowing that it's a chain and that the sushi is, well, bad. The variety was good, the fish wasn't its freshest fish and who puts mayo on their sushi? Why does this happen at chains? The sushi chef was Japanese, as was our waitress, so we talked to her a bit abt our visit to Japan, my sister in law, etc. But the sushi was warm, fell apart and the fish, bland...I'll just stickl w/ Crazy Fish, who does his sushi with love and knows what my husband and I like.",

I talked up the place all the way there - they will cook the food in front of us and do tricks - you won't beleive it! Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food.   I was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!  Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, \"cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!\" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?  SO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there.",

I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air.  So we decided to try Benihana's.    Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke.  His \"performance\" was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat!  The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty.  You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold.  They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats.  They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls.  They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out.  This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for.",

The hubby-to-be and I went to eat more sushi.  The sushi bar was totally dead, and the chefs didn't really talk to us except to ask if the sushi was good.  I lied a little, because they were a little on the warm side, and they fell apart when picked up.  We had the typical warm edamame minus salt?!?!?  How can you eat edamame without salt?  I guess you have to ask for it to be salted.  We decided to take a trip around the country and ordered a CA roll, Phili roll, Alaskan roll, Boston roll and added the Shrimp lovers roll.    The server missed our empty iced tea glasses on a few occasions (it is darn hot here in AZ and we were thirsty!) and she wasn't the most pleasant person.    If you have a group of people in town, this is a great place for food entertainment.  Make sure you budget your time, as the \"show\" and eating can last a couple hours.    They have their own parking lot, and lots of indoor seating when there is a long wait (make reservations on the weekends!)",

My experience at this Benihana was definitely a great one, and I will be coming back.  This restaurant was excellent in my opinion.  The bathrooms were as clean as the rest of the restaurant.  Our service and food were excellent, I don't really like Southeast Asian food but this was amazing.  Having it prepared right in front of us was definitely a treat.  The price was very reasonable as well, we have gotten away from other lesser quality restaurants with a bigger bill.  I ordered the Chicken Yakisoba, which was the most familiar thing for me on the menu, and was great.  The chef made us little 'appetizers' as we watched so we would not get hungry while waiting.    The manager kept around us making sure we had the best experience we could.  For that I thank him, my family and I really enjoyed Benihana.  The food, service, cleanliness, and even price were all reasonable/exceptional.  We also didn't have to get all dressed up to go out for lunch either.  We will definitely be returning.",

The food was excellent and the price was ridiculously low. We enjoyed beef dumplings (~$3.50), rainbow rolls ($5.25) and another appetizer that was so uninspiring I already forgot what it was.   Our server, who was also the bartender, was getting worked by the non-stop mass of people waiting for tables, and making drinks. She had another bartender to help but he seemed to focused on grumbling and giving the bar a really negative vibe.   Overall, we all have bad days, so being my first visit to Benihana, I'll take it as that. The good prices and pretty good food will have me returning soon enough.",

It takes a while for the cook to show up and get prepared, so if you don't have much time, don't come here.   Very nice to see that your food is cooked fresh in front of you, but it's too bad they use the same oils and sauces to cook everything in, makes it a bit bland, but not horrible. Fried rice is the best! Sushi, not so much.  Been here a couple times and secretly wish they could do maybe a slightly different version of entertainment... possibly? Don't wanna sound mean, but I know everything that they're gonna do already. Not saying that I can do any better, but it would be nice to see a new trick once in a while.

Anyway, I am a huge fan of teppanyaki and have been to several other places around the valley who do it quite well.  I mean how can you not love flaming onion volcanoes, shrimp acrobatics and other food awesomeness?  It's like a circ du solei of food!  Yet I didn't listen to almost everyone I know or 2/3rds of the Yelp reviews saying this place isn't all that wonderful.  Ok, ok - one point Yelp and my friends; zero points Jason.  Benihana isn't in fact all that great.  Benihana is however good at making a teppanyaki place that runs like a well oiled machine or at least a ride at Disney Land.  They shuffle you in, wait until your table is full, put on a little show, charge you way too much then shuffle you out the door to make room for the next group.  Aside from the food being waaaaay overpriced, the service is excellent and meals tasty.  The \"show\" isn't bad either.  Except now they aren't allowed to do any of the cool stuff because people were apparently getting hurt from flying shrimp and flaming onion volcanoes.  And Benihana being a corporate chain behemoth decided they better do away with the \"dangerous\" stuff.  Bummer!  In my option the food and service is on par with just about any other teppanyaki place around.  So, if you have a hankering for the stuff you are probably better off going to Ichi Bahn or some other place that may be cheaper, not feel like a Disney ride, and do cooler food tricks n' stuff.  But, if you must go, sign up for Benihana's birthday club thing because they will give you a $30 gift certificate which is pretty solid and the reason why I went.",

    "text": "So this is my first time to a Teppanyaki restaurant. We came for a friend's graduation reception, large group with friends and family (I'd say about 30 people?)   It's pretty cool to see the chef cook right in the front, our chef was entertaining enough to show off some of his skills to get our laughter. The food was decent, I had the Land n' Sea (filet mignon and scallops), especially with the 'meat sauce?'. The veggies were pretty good too, but our combination had a bit too much of onions, I think.  Overall the night was fun, however, with a pre-selected menu special for the graduate, I can't tell about the prices. I might have to come back my own to know it, lol",

Our waitress ignored us for about 15 mins, just until we were about to leave (her section was not busy) and wasn't very friendly when she did arrive. We picked 4 or 5 sushi rolls off of the happy hour menu and had to repeat our order to her 3 times because she couldn't remember it and wouldn't write it down. She went into the kitchen, came back and asked is again which rolls we wanted. She came back with 3 sushi rolls and asked us which ones we were missing. We asked her which were the 3 she had just given to us and she didn't even know what they were. Went to ask the kitchen and sent the Manger out to talk to us like we were giving her a hard time. He of course couldn't help us because he obviously didn't kno what rolls we had, and didn't kno what we ordered because our waitress didn't write it down. 10 minutes later she brings out one more roll and doesn't say what it is and walks away. Never refilled our drinks. Didn't come back to check on us just dropped our tab as she walked by. Charged us for 6 sushi rolls and never came back. We had to go to the hostess to flag down the Manger to correct our tab.",

Now while some of the chefs are better than others they are all pretty good in my book. Make sure you upgrade to the chicken fried rice its well worth the $3 extra. Every month they have a different special for two and its usually a good deal. This last time we went it was the chicken and steak for two and it was tasty. Make sure to ask for garlic butter on your entree if you like garlic because in my book it makes everything taste better. Overall we enjoy going to Benihana but not too often because it can get expensive quick lol... be sure to sign up for their email club and they will send you a $30 gift certificate for your birthday!",

Over the years, we always get the same lady trying to upsell all the food and drinks.  I always go with the mojito (two or three) followed by a Kirin.  Yum Yum.    I had the filet mignon and shrimp. Awesome.  The best part, of course, is the chef.  Here, it's either hit or miss.  One year we got a Mexican woman and it just wasn't the same.  This year, we had Chu and he was excellent. (Though he told us how to say I Love You in Japanese and I pointed out that it was Chinese - he was a little surprised :-)  Also, my 6 year old came up to me during dinner and whispered, \"mommy, if you made salad like this I would eat it every night.\"  Quick, get me the recipe!!!!  Something I've always wondered is whether you're supposed to tip the chef, so I asked on the way out.  The manager told me that the chef and waitress split the tip 50/50 but the chef always appreciates something extra.  Don't we all :-)",

    "text": "Review from now 2018- wife got an email for her birthday so we went to celebrate although we tend to go to other more proximate non corporate establishments.  Despite reservations we were seated about 10 minutes late, and when we were, God Bless the server but it must have been her first night. We were stressed for her and patient, we were worried that she'd drop something and at one point she actually did. At one point she disappeared and we were joking that she quit and was driving home!  Now, if you, our server are personally are reading this, don't take this personally- that's what happens when you are new, but the fact that the company allowed this to happen makes you wonder about the training program. Luckily she had a trainer who was clearly a pro and was letting the trainee try her best. But guess what, it was my wife's birthday and the birthday of a girl who was with another family at our table.  It literally took an hour from our reservation time to even get our soup. We joked that we should go get some hamburgers to tide us over. Eventually the chef came out and he was very cool and very capable and did a great job. The food was good but each person got served at different times so at one point 2 people in our group were done eating before the last person in each of our groups even got their food. Then he offered us onions- after half of us were completely done with our meat- so who wants a plate of onions after dinner? So the timing was a bit off and from experience at other restaurants this is not normal. I did speak with the manager and he gave us a fair and greatly appreciated discount. Hey I worked food services when I was young and any new job can be stressful but for a big company like Benihanna to miss it this hard is a mystery.   Review from 2010- The best dining experience in a long time. It's more like the Jungle Cruise but with food.  Great service. Great (right at your table) chef. And we got out if there spending less  than we planned. I forgot that its kid friendly too. If you've never tried it, I highly recommend it",

Every single employee from the hostess, to the server, to the chef, to the manager, asked us if we celebrating a special occasion. Why didn't they just say we're so over priced, no one would eat here unless it's their anniversary or birthday.   There are so many other teppanyaki restaurants around the valley that are just as good, if not better. I would probably go to one of them (many of which are not chains) before heading back to Benihana.",

Wow!! Oh and edamame...ridiculous portion! Everything was really good. Salmon was cooked and portioned well. Teriyaki not bad. Shrimp good, well everything was surprisingly good and all for $10....that's right $10....the price for the portions and taste was deserving of 3.5 to 4 stars..service was also excellent...",

    "text": "Been to  Benihana's a couple of times, but this last visit was a complete disaster.  The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and they got their drinks, soup, salad, and food before us.  They also left 40 minutes before our table did.  Our waiter apparently failed at being a chef, and decided to try his luck serving.  He didn't know the menu, he asked me three times about the Salmon Nigiri that I ordered, twice confusing it for sake.  It's a Japanese restaurant, you'd think he'd have basic sushi nailed down.    Instead of serving his single table, he was singing happy birthday to a few other groups.  The fried rice was literally....fried.  Afterwards I spoke with the Manager.  I'm usually not one to complain, and I wasn't rude or anything, but just wanted to bring up the situation to management.  He wasn't surprised at all, and even told me that he knew this particular server was lagging...horribly.  For the life of me I can't figure out why NO ONE stepped in to help the poor guy throughout our 2 HOUR dinner fiasco.  No trainer, no help, nada.  I can tell you I won't be back until I get my free birthday meal, but even then, for the price I'll pay just for my spouse's meal, I'll consider a number of places before stopping here again.",

It's not spectacular per say but the spectacle of watching your food get cooked in front of you is worth it. There are many simple ingredients and the recipes are straight forward. The meat and seafood are of a good standard. The dishes are classic tepanyaki/hibachi. Similar food can of course be found in smaller independent japanese and east asian places. Tasty and colorful but not necessarily novel. Their sushi and sashimi selection is good and a nice addition to their menu choices. Service is attentive and polite and the restaurant looks fine. Prices are reasonable for this type of place. All in all it's a nice place to go out to once in awhile. If you have never tried this type of dining then it's a must go at least once!",

After 40 minutes we checked back in and were told that we have only waited 40 of the 90 minutes. They had six open tables and only the walk ins waiting.   I would understand this type of reservation based seating at a high end place in Scottsdale but in chandler, come on! I called the manager and complained but he stated that they need to plan an hour and a half ahead and that's why they keep the tables empty. I guess I didn't understand the Benihana seating plan.   my advice is to make reservations and only show up with reservations, otherwise you'll leave pretty pissed just like me.

We waited for over 20 minutes!  Not cool when your restaurant is empty, and I had a reservation.  The hostess offered zero explanation or apology for the delay either.  Upon being sat, we did have an overall pretty terrific waiter.  He helped us to choose one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had, a Coconut Mojito.  Very Tasty!  We started with a sushi roll appetizer which was also very very good.  The only feedback for the waiter would be that he was trying to sell us on upgrading to a better cut of steak, but in the process basically explained that their standard steak cut was crap.  I get an upsell, but don't completely chastise the other product in the process.  The food was terrific, and our chef did a very nice job.  You could tell he was probably new, but it makes sense to have the less experienced guys during the slower hours until they are pros.  Overall this was a great experience!",

We were sat at our table at 5:30...waited for 20 minutes for just water and our server to take our order. Then waited 45 minutes for the chef to come to our table. It was ridiculous! We were all starving at the point and soooo annoyed! Our server \"forgot\" our rice in the beginning and we had to constantly ask for water. Then we had to ask him twice for a to go box...flaky! Over priced and NEVER going back!!!!!",

    "text": "I have mixed feeling about this place. I have been here twice and had two completely different experiences.  First time was pretty upsetting. We had to wait ~45 minutes for a dinner table, at which point they sat us in the bar area. The waitress was rarely to be seen and served me won-ton soup in a chipped bowl (serious health code violation - took a picture). Half-way through our meal, they sat some people with us at our small table which made it somewhat awkward.  Second time was much better. We made reservations and got seated at the Hibachi table. Chef was quite exciting and entertaining, keeping everyone involved. Had some good cold Sake with apple flavor, the rest of the food was pretty standard.  Be sure to sign up for their birthday promotion ($30 off one person's meal), but keep in mind that it is for one person only (they are pretty serious about that)!",

I too, of many, was tricked into coming here for the first time with my $30 Birthday Coupon. Called before and asked if I had to print out or if I could show my phone because my printer was acting up. The gentleman on the phone told me I could just show my phone, no problem. And then I called again because I realized it expired yesterday( before the end of the month like it advertised) and So I call back, again he tells me no problem. I make the drive out, we sit at the table when the server tells me it has to have a bar code.. the coupon they emailed to me did not contain a barcode, and the manager then tells me because its expired. None of this was explained when I clearly did my part, calling ahead, asking before I even bothered to come out. Needless to say, they didn't honor it, the lady we sat next to said she had same problem, so my family made the decision because of the poor experience to dine elsewhere.. (the Chili's next door was AMAZING!) normally i'd pass on Chili's but they changed up their menu, Cowboys game just started and the server was so great!! Food delicious as well..it all worked out in the end. But I would NOT Recommend Benihana to anyone!",

He said let me check he walked back there and not even 30 seconds later walked up with my order. I was beyond upset no sorry no apology from manager.

I would say the cooks were just a little cheesey and most of what he said was just telling us what he was doing \"cutting the chicken\". That part isn't that important to me though so I wouldn't let that ruin the experience. The food was just ok, I would say it was not seasoned near as much as we are accustomed to. Most places like this give you the vegetables together but for some reason he served them separately, seems strange to give someone a pile of grilled onions when they dont have anything else on their plate to eat it with.  Overall the I have paid less for better flavored food, but I didn't hate it.",

Chef continually served us last and in doing so our portions were smaller than the rest. So small we were shocked. The \"appetizer\" was basically the amount if you had sliced up one small shrimp into four pieces and put it on our plate.  Realize that they put everyones portions on the cook surface, cook it and distribute it.The rest of the table at least two pieces of shrimp I'm sure we were all supposed to receive more than this as an appetizer. Amazing what they give you versus what you are charged. Chef took so long to cook each item by the time you have everything and you played most of it was cold. I have gone to other Benihana locations on for years and have enjoyed it. We will not return to this one.",

    "text": "We had the second experience in a row of terrible service and below acceptable food at this Chandler location. Benihana's has always been a family favorite of ours. Unfortunately, the last two times we were there to celebrate a family birthday we had the same chef. He was a nice person but completely unskilled at delivering quality food and although nice, he was so awkward in his delivery that it made us uncomfortable. Both times we waited at least 45 minutes to an hour until a chef arrived. This time we had hair on our shrimp appetizer and each prepared item was served several minutes apart. (We know the routine at Teppanyaki, not our first rodeo) we can go on and on but perhaps THE MOST disturbing encounter was the manager on duty Ryan M. was completely not accommodating, never apologized, never offered to make it right and engaged in negative, defensive behavior the entire time which of course did nothing but enrage our guests and RUINED our birthday experience so much so that we came straight home to write this review. Service 101 - take some accountability, fake compassion, APOLOGIZE even if you don't mean it, make it right to protect your consumer experience and your business!! Conveniently, there is no corporate email to address the concern so here it is YELP, thank you for providing a platform... to alert other consumers not to waste $200 on subpar food, ZERO entertainment experience, and the most pathetic managerial service ever!",

    "text": "I starting coming to Benihana in 2010 and would consistently visit until 2014. That year I had a rather unpleasant birthday experience that left me not wanting to return.   ::cue flashback::  I had made a reservation for a set amount of people but had a few additional friends show up as a surprise for my birthday. This upset the manager at the time and he chastised me in front of all my guests for being unaware that there was going to be extra people. An honest mistake but the manager made such a huge deal about it being a safety issue that some of my friends left to appease him. However, throughout the meal that followed, other restaurant guests (not from our table) were walking directly behind our chef while his knives were out and in use. If safety was such an issue you'd think something like that would not happen or the manager would do something about it. Nope!  ::end flashback::   Needless to say, I swore off Benihana until this year, when I decided to give them another try...or two, to be exact.    Both visits were around 7:45/8:00pm. Both times we were early for our reservation. Both times we had to wait passed our reservation time to be seated and guests without reservations were sat before us. Why even make a reservation at all? Perhaps as a courteous to the restaurant so they can attempt to staff properly? Thanks?  Teppanyaki is communal dining around a grill so you will be sat with others you don't know. If that bothers you, I suggest gathering enough of your friends and family together that your group will take up a whole table. The other guests we were sat with during this year's visits have been great so no issues there.   Visit A: Friendly and entertaining chef, plenty of drink refills, great commemorative birthday photo, and very accommodating of dietary restrictions.   Visit B: Felt bad for the chef who seem overwhelmed, issues with multiple orders, lacked drink refills, not a great photo and special requests were ignored.   Both times dinner took us until closing time (10pm). Two hours for a meal seems a bit long to me and the younger kids at the table during Visit A were practically asleep by the time the check arrived.    Also, green tea is offered as part of the dining experience. The first time I accept it and stayed up WAYYYYYYYY too late that evening. The second time, I declined. Maybe a decaffeinated option could be offered later in the day?  During both visits the bathroom was gross. Three stalls and each had issues: gross, messy, unflushed, and no toilet paper. Dirty bathrooms make you think dirty kitchen. Yuck-O!   Thank goodness for their genius marketing with the $30 birthday coupon or I doubt they'd have as much business as they do. Both visits, almost every table was sung \"Happy Birthday\". We are now pros at joining along with the song set to the tune of \"If You Are Happy and You Know it Clap Your Hands\"...Which seems like a subtle subliminal messaging now that I think about it. Touche, Benihana, touche.",

We had made a reservation and arrived a little early so we grabbed a few cocktails at the bar.   Drinks were perfect, and then dinner started. The wait staff was happy and throwing off positive vibes. The seating arrangement is 8 people around a cooking station. The chef Nathan aka Nate had us rolling in laughter the whole time he was cooking.  This last visit was probably one of my favorite visits.   We had the chicken and steak meal and the shrimp and steak meal. And it was all cooked perfectly. This place is not super cheap so make sure it's a good celebratory occasion to make it worth while.   We will definitely come back to this location I recommend that you try it out if you like Asian cuisine. You will have a great time.",

We had a reservation, and we were seated right away when we got there. Our chef was good and he was entertaining. That is pretty much the pros.  Now the cons... Our server sucked! She forgot to put in my Las Vegas roll. And when I asked to follow up, she keep saying there was a mix up on the order. That is my fault because?? We had to flag her down for drink refills. The restaurant was not even packed!! Moving on, I ordered the spicy hibachi chicken and my boyfriend had the teriyaki steak. Both were under cooked. The veggies was super greasy and it wasn't seasoned right. For a $30 a plate, at least give us a good quality meal. Did I mentioned this meal was our one way ticket to the bathroom? YEP! It made us sick shortly after we left the restaurant! If you want to get sick, get crappy service and an OK teppan-yaki experience, by all means, come to this Behihana! Otherwise, you're better off taking your business else where.   WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!",

To be fair though two of our party were late but still our table should have been ready when they arrived.  It wasn't.  Once we were seated the experience began and an amazing experience it was.  We were surprised the lunch prices weren't as much as we expected.  Service was excellent.  We were entertained by the Japanese cook preparing our food at our table.  He had a super personality, amazing skills and knew what he was doing when it came to preparing delicious food.  The food?  It was absolutely delicious.  As a matter of fact, their filet mignon was probably the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was tasty, delicious and extremely tender.  Not only were we served amazing food, we were also entertained through our whole meal.  It was an amazing experience and we loved every minute of it.  I can hardly wait until we can go back again!!",

    "text": "I'm disappointed that this location has the Benihana name when they are not living up to the standards. The bad reviews are valid and I wish I would have read them before booking.   SERVICE: Our waitress was good but didn't provide nor ask everyone if they wanted the green tea that is supposed to come with the meals. Also she should have offered the miso instead of the onion soup to everyone that comes with the meals. Other than those things, she was a good server.   CHEF: He did not seem interested in being there and was distracted the entire time. He kept looking at the other tables or around the restaurant while cooking. I get it, they do the same thing with each table and it can get monotonous but part of the appeal is an enthusiastic entertaining chef and we didn't get that.   FOOD: Horrible and overpriced. The salad dressing and the sauces in the bowls were the only good things. The onion soup was salty yet flavorless. Like someone else wrote, it tasted like boiled funions.   The salad was fine, hard to screw up lettuce, carrots and dressing.   Shrimp: disgusting is the only word I can use. They were not cleaned nor deveined and they were overcooked. Rubbery and gross. See my photo of the dirty shrimp. Couldn't eat it. This should be a health violation.   The zucchini, onions and mushrooms were not chopped or sliced well and usually are cooked together but were served separately. The zucchini pieces were thick and not at all the way Benihana restaurants in NY/NJ cook them. This used to be my favorite part of the meal in NY but not here.  The rice wasn't cooked at the table except the fried rice. Since when does Benihana charge for fried rice? That's supposed to be part of the meal. The fried rice was cooked at the table but they charged extra for it. Otherwise the meal comes with stale white rice.   I didn't have the ice cream. Wish they had fruit or something else as a dessert option.   If you're a manager, please don't write me to apologize and provide a free meal like you're doing with others. That won't solve anything and I'll never return so don't bother. What you should is fix the issues or shut down. You're giving Benihana a bad name and provided me with the worst birthday meal.",

They should be ashamed of themselves for giving me nothing for that price they charged me. I'm pissed, never again. Can I give negative stars???",

It was my wife's birthday and she got a $30 coupon, it was really good, our table chef Geoff was funny and explained everything to us as we went along. It was fun watching him cook the fresh food in front of us. They seat you with other couples which was fun because I felt like we we made some new friends. We will be back on my birthday!",

    "text": "I'm not sure why this location has such low ratings.  I went to Benihana for my annual birthday meal.  (If you don't subscribe to the birthday club you need to, free $30 credit every year!)  I made a reservation in advance for 7pm and I was seated at approximately 7:10pm.  The restaurant was waiting for an open chef table so this was not an issue.  Once we were seated, the waitress instantly came and explained the menu and went over the specials and her favorites.  Afterwards, she took drink orders and gave everyone time to review their menu.  After drinks arrived we began to get our appetizers.. soups, salad, etc.  From the time we first interacted with the waitress until the time the chef came it was probably about 15-20 minutes.  Again, not an issue at all which is why they give you appetizers.  The chef was pleasant and entertaining.  He was interactive with each of us.  The food was cooked to perfection and each part was placed out in order, first rice, then vegetables, then meats.  Of course with any Benihana meal, by the time you get your entree your rice and veggies won't be as warm as they are.  (I wonder can this ever change in the future)  All in all, great experience and great service!",

    "text": "Overall, I'm giving this location a 3 because the chefs can be hit or miss. Some don't seem to be up to par and provide a high level of cooking experience. Tonight, for example, was one of those nights. Our reservation was at 5:30 and my stomach is still uneasy. I am not sure what is was, but both myself and my husband started feeling unwell near the end of dinner. I had to run to the restroom before leaving (not a good feeling). I couldn't enjoy my dessert (green tea ice cream) as a result. Over the several times we've been to this location, we've had our share of \"odd\" chefs and that's not the first time we've had an experience that left us a little stomach sick. However, overall, we like the food and taking advantage of the birthday coupon offer (if you sign up for Benihana emails, and provide your bday, you receive a $30 coupon good for a month to redeem on Monday-Thursday). You have to bring at least one person with you as it is a spend $30, get $30 off offer. It's been a tradition for many years now. Overall, we've had some good experiences, but the few times we haven't is why I give a 3 star review. I recommend requesting an experienced chef when making a reservation to avoid some of the bad experiences my husband and I have encountered. When cooked right, I enjoy the hibachi chicken, hibachi streak, colossal shrimp, California rolls, chicken fried rice, and mushroom, french onion type soup!",

So I decided to try HH to see what's its all about, nothing fancy. I arrived around 6:30 pm to plenty of space at the bar, so I sat quickly. After being seated for several minutes I was offered the opportunity to order.  Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Shrimp Roll and a Tokyo Raspberry....Meeeh! Tasted like watery juice.  By 6:50 pm I'm ready to order, but FIRST I must have another drink. I quickly ordered a Yozu Margarita (I think thats what its called) and mom ordered another Benihana Punch.  We then proceeded to order our food. I opted for a bowl of shrimp fried rice and side salad, mom ordered the Sea Bass. After quietly waiting 20 mins with no second  beverage, I made note to one of the bartenders about our drinks. By 7:40 no food and no drinks. I watched 3 people behind the bar make drinks and clean. Where in the heck are my drinks?! When inquiring about the food, we were advised that it was almost done (someone told me that 15 mins ago). Now I'm hungry and thirsty. What makes it bad is that I ordered the drinks TWICE! At this point we're ready to go, so we ask for the food as such. 10 mins later the food arrives...Plated. I THOUGHT I ASKED FOR THIS TO GO! Why is it so difficult to get good service?  Benihana is hit or miss these days. More miss than hit.",

She said it was under my name, then said \"come talk to me when it's closer to 7:30.\" Befuddled, I just gave her a blank expression. I then cancelled our reservation and walked right out. I don't have time to tolerate rude unprovoked behavior like that.  Peace Benihana. I guess I'll never know what deliciousness you have to offer.",

We decided not to stay because we noticed a customer with a firearm dangling on his waist which appeared to be improperly secured. This customer walked right in and was escorted to his table despite the firearm on his waist. The restaurant does not enforce the \"no firearms\" policy. I simply don't understand the need for civilians to have firearms in places were families gather. It is safe to assume that the average civilian does not know how to use a firearm during a stressful situation , such as responding to other firearm threat. It is more likely that armed civilians accidentally shoot innocent bystanders. It has nothing to do with listening to Hollywood or the media. It's common sense. For this reason my family and I will never set foot at this establishment again.",

    "text": "First of all, I just want to say THANK YOU to Benihanas.  I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.  But I have to calls em like I sees em.  Let's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.  I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing.  The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size.  This would be a great place for HH.  I came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.  Their yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.  When we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.  For dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.  And to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.  Once again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts.",

The hostess was not friendly, we waited a while to be seated, even with a reservation. The server was a little more friendly and became gradually more attentive (I think because she realized everyone at our table was getting frustrated), but never really hit the service mark. It took an unreasonable amount of time for the drink orders, and for courses to begin coming.   Then the chef. God bless him. He was new, not Asian, exhausted, and really slow. He kept misreading the ticket, kept serving food we'd ordered to the strangers at the table with us, he missed about every little \"trick\" he tried, and he was clearly nervous (and apparently gets chatty when he's nervous). He was sweating over our food profusely.... until the server came over and turned the vent on 3/4 of the way through the little show. The meal was served so slowly that it was cold and you couldn't enjoy your food. Portions were small and the flavor was bland... I had the hibachi chicken and it was overcooked.... the veggies were burned on bottom and zucchini was slimy on top.... There was so much to be appalled at that when the lady came and asked how our meal was, we just said \"fine\" so we could leave quicker and never return.  I'm pretty sure if we'd complained we'd have just gotten another card for corporate... We were very disappointed and I felt really bad for the experience my son DIDN'T get to have for his special day. You can't have that moment back, you know...  but I wish I could. I would definitely have chosen more wisely.  It was not worth the money spent.",

We get to the table, and there are only enough spaces for the others and when we asked to pull up two more chairs, just for half an hour, the employees just stared at us for a minute, whispered to themselves, and told us we couldn't stay.

First off had a chef just cook the meal and skip all the cool performances I guess thats not that big of a deal but when they distribute the servings I feel the guy with a $20 meal got morr than my $50 meal had two lobster tails about 2 shrimp choped up and rice allways good but never got mushrooms and onions and zucchini had 3 bites so to bring to light I had 2 lobster tails good  And fried rice that's it all else was devided to every one else.  I dont think I will go back.  If I pay for my portion of a meal I expect a full portion or my deserved portion of the meal. Taste is good portion size is like a gamble of rolling the dice and I craped out. Hope you dont have the same dining experience. $150 for food for 2 people. Don't think I will return hope you dont get the same treatment.",

We ordered just about everything except the shrimp. Noodles, rice, chicken, beef and veggies. The portion size was perfect and the taste was great. Along with the service.  They have children's portions that are written on the chefs hat. Cute and creative way to get the whole family in to dine.",

Look possibly under staffed but man did they make it work!   The food was excellent and cooked to perfection. The veggies were so different then when I had gone to a Benihana in California (back in the early 2000's) haha. I loved them though amazing and you can't go wrong with sesame seeds!!! Juan was so fun to watch cook. He made my mom jump several times, even though he was trying to get a kids reaction. To say the least we had a great time and we were so stuffed!!  HOWEVER, unfortunately I have to add how the night ended. This brings me to the 5 star review that I think is really a 4.5 star. Rieko and Juan deserve a 5 star though which I had left for them.  My only negative:  When we were walking to the front after being so stuffed and had a great evening we never had gotten a \"have a great night.\" I'm not sure why these two ladies never acknowledged us. I think they were too into their conversation with each other about how someone is not texting one of them back. However, my husband and I who have worked in a grocery store knows the importance of leaving a final impression. We were at the front desk finding a toothpick and they both kept on with their conversation, not even turning from each other trying to hide it. Hopefully next time we come we have a better ending.  Thanks Reiko and Juan for the great start off!! We will be back to see you both soon! :)",

There is one lady in the bar area that always does a great job and we love getting her.  The rest of the staff is a hit or miss, more miss.  Maybe it's because we use a coupon but we always tip the full amount so it shouldn't matter.

The True Benihana experience is a five course meal prepared on a griddle in front of you, while the chef entertains you with acrobatic knife wielding and jokes. The Benihana chef we had today kept the teenagers entertained which allowed the adults To relax and enjoy their meals as well. Our chef was no exception. He was fantastic and our food was delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and met all of our needs, frequently refilling our drinks and removing plates during the show!    Benihana is great for special occasions. A five course meal with drinks, a carafe of Pinot Noir, a sushi appetizer including tip only set us back $130.",

I love restaurants like these; I love that they cook in front of you and entertain their guests while cooking. The chefs always include their own jokes and personalities while cooking, and I feel as though it really makes going to a restaurant a memorable experience.   We came here for a friend dinner, and the waiter who took us to our seats were very accommodating to our large group, and was patient with us the entire time.   The food here was okay. Nothing too extraordinary or exciting. Definitely filling though. The highlight of this experience was our chef and the chef behind him, working at another table. They would toss jokes at each other, and were very comfortable with cooking in front of us, and made us laugh a lot with all their food puns. Overall, it was the people who served us that made this restaurant a great experience.",

    "text": "This is the second time my family and myself have come to this location, and this truly was the only time that was extremely disappointing. We came here for my moms birthday, and had a reservation at noon. We all came a little early, not realizing that they didn't open until noon. Odd to be a restaurant taking reservations for right as you open, but alright.   Once we were in, one of the hostesses \"greeted\" us, and checked us in. It didn't take long, thankfully, but as we had already sat down once we were called upon we started to grab our things and started to walk towards our table, as the same hostess called out to us and said that our table was ready. Now, it doesn't sound like much but her tone was rude, and unnecessary.   I thanked her as I helped my family and we went to our seats. Our waitress was training another, and was nice about it. Introduced everyone and the menu, talked about upgrades and such, although she talked fairly fast.   Our drink ordered were taken immediately and shortly after our food orders. My dad ordered two appetizers for our family to share, which were the main disappointment with the food. We ordered gyoza which was cold, bland, and had grill marks on it that were obviously not real. We ordered tempura which was so expensive for how little we got. Two shrimp, one asparagus, a piece of onion, and a piece of sweet potato for 12$. The rest of our meal was good, just the beginning portion of our night was disappointing and most likely would not return.",

I had the New York strip steak (cooked medium rare) and the included shrimp. Both were tasty and buttery good. The fried rice was also cooked pretty well and the soup was also seasoned well. Now you're likely going to ask why the two star review then given the above mentions? Well before we were seated we were asked to wait somewhere between 30-40 minutes for seating. Mind you the half the restaurant was empty and even more of the hibachi type grills were open. What we ended up finding out was they were essentially waiting for a larger group to eventually come in so that they could seat us more efficiently for their benefit. I wasn't really happy with this and wish they had just told us the truth instead of \"we're really packed and there's no availability right now.\" Also during the meal we never got refills on water even though they had plenty of servers literally just waiting around near the kitchen chatting. Overall, not sure I'd return again as the service as drastically decreased since the many years ago when we had experienced Benihana.",

What is the meaning behind throwing shrimp tails into your hat and front left pocket?  Am I still writing coherently (he'll check later anyway)?  When did my daughter fall asleep on my shoulder?  Is my grandmother-in-law going to pay even though we came for her birthday?  When will the check come?

I was in a party of 4, and 2 other couples were seated with us at the Hibachi Grill. I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, Rainbow Roll and shrimp tempura Hand Roll, as well as a Bottle of Sake. The sake was delicious and had a hint of nutmeg and apple peels. My sushi came out timely before the rest of the tables food was beginning to be prepared so we passed the sushi around for everyone to taste. The cream cheese in the Philadelphia rolls was scrumptious. Our chef Christian was entertaining and funny, he did the volcano trick and the shrimp tail in the hat and pocket trick and recieved plenty of \"ooh\" and \"aahs\" from me and the others. I was rather impressed with how fresh the food was and how nutritiously \"clean\" the food was prepared. For a party of 4 including drinks and appetizers our bill came to only $107.  I would love to go to Benihana anytime, especially if someone else pays.",

    "text": "I don't get why there are so many haters of Benihana! If you are looking for good teppanyaki japanese cooking, this is a very good place for it. I have tried many things here but you know what they don't get enough credit for? Their sushi! The Vegas roll at Benihana is the best vegas roll I have ever had and might actually be my favorite sushi roll ever! Now, onto their regular food, I have tried many menu items and all have been good. That includes: teriyaki steak, hibachi chicken, hibachi shrimp, spicy hibachi chicken, and colossal mango shrimp. However, the best dishes I ordered here in addition to their Vegas Roll are the yakisoba and the hibachi scallops. These are both delicious and some of the better values on the menu I felt. The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!",

To our surprise, the restaurant was virtually empty with just one other table occupied.  We therefore had the entire hibachi/tepanyaki table to ourselves!  It was fun, and the fact that it was just the two of us sped up dinner service considerably.  I ordered Benihana rolls as an appetizer; they were basically tasty California rolls, loosely packed but a real bargain at only $4.75.  For my entree, I went with the Hibachi scallops.  Now unlike Kyoto (the Japanese restaurant I usually hit up on my birthday), there are not a whole lot of veggies prepared as sides with your entree.  In a way, that was a good thing, because I didn't waste any food.  I got a ton of scallops, and I took home what I couldn't finish.  It was great value for the price!  Still, my chef was not Asian and the emptiness of the restaurant did make it feel a little weird.  Perhaps I'll add a star when I update my review after the next visit...",

When I went to the other side of the restaurant she saw me walking and they had just mopped the area and she ran over to me saying \"be careful mommy\".  How cute is that?  My husband, son, his girlfriend and I went for dinner and had a great time.  They took my son's and girlfriends picture because it was a special occasion for them.  We ordered filet, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The only complaint I have is their drinks are weak and extremely pricey.  I don't mind paying more for a good drink but theirs were definitely lacking.   Their food is also overpriced but it is always a fun time having your food cooked for you as you sit around the table and are entertained by the chef.   We will be back.......................

The Phoenix franchise was never quite as good as Benihanas in Chicago or Florida or many other places I've tried but it was always quite acceptable.  They must now be trying to cut costs by mixing everything liquid with water.  The salad dressing has gone from tasty to untasteable...and the dipping sauces that used to be thick and delicious are now so weak that you can almost see right through them.  THis definitely was our worst dining experience of the year (since we go for the food and not the show -- which was fine.)  Forget this Benihana unless you want unseasoned processed-tasting food.  Watch the show through the windows and then go anywhere else to eat.  If you don't know how good they once were and how bad the food is now you might credibly compare it with cheap hamburg joint food but we know what it was like even just a year ago.  This establishment has definitely gone way downhill.  Don't waste your time or money.",

I think this is a kind of place that is great to go to once for the show, or maybe if you're taking someone that's never been before, but after that, I don't see any reason to pay the price they expect for the food.  It's a great show, and the food I had the other day was pretty damn great, but I wouldn't pay that amount again.  The service at this one was ok.  It took forever from when we palced our order to get the chef out there to start cooking (Yes I know he probably has to get his mise en place ready once he receives the order from the waitress), but we were waiting for quite a while.  Also, at the end of our meal, it took an equally long time just to get the bill.  One nice thing they do is if it's someone's birthday, they take a picture and print it out for you right there...so that's a kinda nice touch.",

I believe Benihana is one such place. If you're coming for the show, great - I've seen it. You may enjoy it.  I come for the food and service.  I have been consistently impressed with both.  Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops, sashimi, sushi, sushi rolls, the onion soup, the vegetable tempura, and so on.  I have infrequently had issues with the food. I told them it was unacceptable and it was whisked away to be replaced with more than acceptable food. No grumbling, fussing, evil looks, or exasperated sighs - just a quick fix of the issue.  I have never had any issue with the wait staff.   We had an issue with one chef once. He simply couldn't get things right, he even dropped his knife. We didn't even say anything, but the manager showed up, brought us desert AND comped our entire meal. That speaks to the watchfulness of the management and their commitment to quality.   My spouse can be a very particular eater. Yet we have returned time and again here because they get it right.  The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars are the hours (they're closed between 2pm and 5pm right in the middle of MY lunch time), and they can be a bit pricey.",

We wanted time between our soup and salad, and salad and main entree.  Kase said he was really good with the timing.  Well.......our soup came immediately and the salad the minute I put my spoon down.  I literally had 3 bites of the salad when the dinner came.  I said to the server (not Kase)-\"that had better NOT be our dinner.\"  At which time he put the dinner down.  The steak was ordered medium and it was WELL DONE.  The chicken fried rice was dry. I was so mad that it ruined the night.  My husband always tips 25%  He left a 10% tip. We were in and out, including drinks in 45 minutes.  It will be a long, long time before we go back.

    "text": "I've been here for the live cooking and loved it. I went last night to use my birthday certificate and found them to be really crowded, with a wait for everywhere. I was bummed, but I had to use my certificate that day. I got put on the list, but the hostess didn't ask which list I wanted to be on (chef's table or regular) and I assumed that meant I would get the first available. However, we went to check and she said that there was a wait for the regular dining and would I like to be on that list too. Well, yeah. I didn't come here to sit. I asked about the lounge area. It had a wait too. Basically you can go get a drink and take it back to the waiting area. Ugh, ok. Thankfully when we got seated, the server was really cool. I forgot his name, they don't seem to have name tags. He was great, the food was good, so the experience was saved. Just dealing with that hostess who didn't want to willingly provide information was a pain. I've seen perkier people working at Denny's. A place of that caliber should make better sure that people who are paid to make you feel welcome in that establishment at least smile.",

I recommend the hand rolls and philly rolls.  I usually get 2 hand rolls and a philly, and it costs less than 10$ and is pretty filling! The fish tastes fresh and they use the best seaweed and rice.  Sometimes I will also get some nigri if I am extra hungry.  Best of all, dont forget the free hot green tea.",

We ordered the hibachi chicken and steak for two for $45.00, which came with soup, salad, shrimp, chicken fried rice and some veggies.  The soup, was a basic broth with a couple of fried onions and green onions thrown in...the salad was iceberg lettuce with some grape tomatoes, shredded carrot, shredded purple cabbage and a dressing that was a bit bland.  Then we watched the chef grill up some shrimp, it was fine but nothing fancy there.  The chicken fried rice was prepared first, I ate it when given to me so I could eat it hot.  Then the chicken and steak was cooked up, with only salt and pepper, so pretty bland there...we were also given grilled onions and zucchini, also bland...so I won't be going back...perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but it wasn't too exciting for the price.",

My friends and I arrived at 7:52PM and we let them know we were ready to be seated...since one person who was with our group was not there we had to wait to be seated...ok that's fine. So at about 8:20 the last person arrives and we ask to be seated. The hostess told us that we could not be seated since our reservation had to be given up. I asked why and she said cause our entire party wasn't here by 8:15. I couldn't believe that they didn't tell us about this rule!  We were given free appetizers and some free rolls for the incontinence (which makes me think they double booked our table). At 9:25 we were FINALLY seated!  I asked a hostess if she could bring me some soy sauce since I had ordered rolls at the bar and she said sure. 15 minutes later I still had not gotten my soy sauce so I got up and looked for it myself. I have been a hostess before and MANY MANY times I have accommodated guests by getting them little things that they need even if I was not their server. I finished my rolls and shortly after I was sick. Seriously horrible customer service, horrible food and I will NOT be returning and I highly suggest that no one else visit this Benihana!",

The hostesses were giving me a hard time when I told them that we needed to be seated before my friend (hence, the surprise) even though we had made a reservation in advance and explained this to them. They kept telling me that the entire party had to be present and I reiterated that we would be a couple people short until the birthday girl arrived with her boyfriend. I had to get slightly rude with them and tell them that I had just received a text that the birthday girl was parking and we needed to be seated NOW. Once we finally got seated, the dinner was fun, delicious and entertaining, albeit over-priced for the amount that you get to eat. I also felt like we were rushed out of there after the grill was cleaned, but I will give Benihana 3 stars because I would recommend it to people who have never been before and don't mind spending $100 for 2 dinners and a couple drinks. I don't think we will return, but it was a fun experience, mainly due to our friends making it memorable and the chef putting on a good show!",

There was one point where  the waitress got busy and a few drinks sat empty for a minute but I was impressed that the manager was walking around throughout the time and caught the dry drinks.  There's almost nothing worse than DDS (dry drink syndrome)!  We definately had a nice time but for the price, I would only go there if I had a discount--especially in this economy where my dollar needs to go a lot farther.",

I was delighted that we were seated at a chef table with another group who were also celebrating birthdays.  It turned out to be an awesome evening.  We all had so much fun.  The Chef was friendly and really did a wonderful job.  The little touches like a mickey mouse shaped pile of rice was excellent.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I had the chicken and shrimp which was wonderful.  I also tried spicy tuna sushi (for the first time) and loved it.  They were very organized and attentive to our every need.  We were so full and got so much more food than I had expected (my entree included a soup, appetizer of shrimp and a salad that was excellent).  I was happy to use my birthday coupon they sent to me via email.  It saved me 30.00 off the bill.  This is a fun place for a special night, lots of energy going on in the room.  I cannot wait to go back.  I also noticed they had a huge drink list.  I did not drink any alcoholic beverage that evening but when I go back I plan to try one of their fun tropical drinks.  One of them was a huge \"fish bowl\" type glass. It seemed the entire place was celebrating birthdays.  Oh they also sing to you and give you a free ice cream if it's your birthday. All around fun.",

    "text": "First and last time coming to Benihana. Very disappointing experience, esp since it was our first time here. I have had hibachi style food many times and I have not experienced such slow cooking service. I hate to write negative reviews but my husband and I along with other customers at our table dreaded the experience. Our reservations were at 8:30pm and we didn't get our whole entree served until 10:30. 2 whole hours of waiting for the chef to first show up at our station, then very slowly the chef cutting and sauteing. After rice is served it took another half hour for vegetables, and another half hour for meat...it made no sense to eat portions individually, the purpose of the entree is to eat it as a whole instead of having cold rice and vegetables by the time your meat/seafood is done grilling. There were a total of 3 guests at our table with birthdays, they did not sing or anything for us because by the time we got our food they were closing up. Tables surrounding us who started MUCH later ate and left an hour before us? At the end those of us who got our food 2 hrs later just got it packed to go and no one ate at that moment, we were all sleepy by 11pm on a working night and were just baffled by the whole experience. I feel bad for the chef who hosted us, but he should only cook for a party of 4 max if he is in training or something causing for the lack of skill. 8 guests were too much for him to handle in the matter of 2+ hrs. I hope they can work together as a team and improve their service.",

Hour and a half later we finally sit. Looking around 5 other tables were still waiting. The cook didn't start cooking until almost 9:15. His food cart was not stocked. He didn't have enough shrimp and vegetable appetizers for the whole table. My husband didn't get vegetables because he ran out. The guy made it seem like a huge inconvenience to get more since he already made it for everyone else so my husband didn't get any even though I asked him to please get more since we are paying for it. The guy could not keep track of who ordered what and was putting the wrong food in the wrong plates and just kept making jokes about it. He was also making a bunch of racist jokes and comments. He also let us know he was just fired from his last job a few weeks ago. Once everything was done it was past 1030 and we were just trying to leave and we asked for the bill and no desert since we were there so long and the waitress took 15min just to bring our checks back. (she told us her coworkers played a joke on her and locked her in the freezer). We finally left right before 11pm. 4 hours and $100 bucks later..safe to say our whole night was ruined.",

    "text": "After many years of being a Benihana regular and testing several locations in different states, I can say that the AZ locations have ruined it for me. I know it can be a lengthy dining process however our table was fairly swift with ordering and getting organized etc, although the staff and chef were NOT. Our 1.5 hour expected dinner (post seating) turned into a 2.5 affair--even after the doors closed. The waitress visited us every half hour--not a good look. The chef overcooked the shrimp appetizer, the colossal shrimp, and my filet. Not to mention another customer requested a ton of extra seasoning which the chef felt compelled to add to my filet. So not only was their pricy filet overcooked and brittle with every bite but overseasoned, not per my request.   Once everything was done, the first items were ice cold, which is sometimes common but didn't help their case tonight. If the chef had cooked (like the chef we saw at the table next to us) and stopped talking and joking the entire time, we may have had some well prepared and warm/hot meals. The chef made an inappropriate joke or two. Bashed a previous customer about their eating preferences and also for some reason thought it was appropriate to ask my guest why they are vegetarian. This put an already uncertain first timer on the spot and was, to be quite frank, none of the chef's business. If they cared about why people have certain eating preferences, go ask your friends or someone on the street. Don't put customers on the spot for ordering items off of your company's menu...??!? I've noticed the chefs at this location take the friendliness to another level and become TOO familiar and playful with guests--this not only can make other customers uncomfortable but can be inappropriate and obviously unnecessary.   Overall--Just a ruined birthday experience. Even if I got another $30 certificate (which was a waste this time around) I won't be back to this location and probably not others. Also done promoting/recommending this chain to friends.",

Then as we sat down to enjoy our meal, where we were given a bowl of soup. My wife's soup was given with a complementary hair in the bowl. We opted to trade that for one thin sliced zucchini strip. Finally we made it to the main course where the cooks are rationing the garlic butter during the cooking procedure. It turns out, that they were now using garlic butter only on select items. Mmmmm I found out their food really taste different without seasoning. Everyone at the table was asking for more garlic butter, but we were advised that we had to pay $.50 extra and we can only get it from the waitress who never came to the table. After our meal, the waitress asked if there was anything else we wanted. We told him it would be nice to have extra butter when you're cooking, or at least come by and bill me $.50 so I can get more butter. I they have gone down hill? What do you think. It's risky if you go there.",

I asked if that was really reasonable, given the size of the waiting area and the unlikely happening of all 40 people showing up at the same exact time. The manager was so nasty - he flat out said he won't do it - he will NOT sit a table until at least ten people are here.... I said, 10? Before you were saying 40.... so is it 10 or is it 40? He finally agreed to seat us once 10 people arrived... thank god. Please note that it wasn't so much the message that was so awful - it was the nasty tone and the body language. Granted, what he was saying wasn't what was agreed upon during the two phone conversations and the one face-to-face meeting about the event - but the issue truly was in the delivery. He was down right nasty.  Moving on to when we finally got seated...Our server Ryan, was AMAZING. He was SO friendly, full of jokes and always smiling. From the moment we got seated, the experience completely changed from an F to an A.  Carlos and Kevin were our chefs... again, amazing!! Friendly, accommodating, great at what they do... telling jokes the entire time and engaging their audience.   I am amazed that the three servers/chefs were able to turn this around and make it such an amazing experience. They took a completely ruined baby shower and turned it into the party it was supposed to be.   The manager needs more training.",

Then the waitress told us that we could come in with the physical printout and they would credit us back. Well we went back in and the manager said she couldn't do that. Talk about lack of customer service, absolutely absurd. We also shared a table with other people who had the same certificate and they gave them a hard time as well. Don't bother wasting your money on mediocre food.",

I ordered lunch to go, the restaurant took a while to run my gift card, then after waiting for 15 minutes, and having 3 people say my card had $0 balance the original associate says it just took a while for it to run, then they gave me my order which was incorrect.  I asked for a shrimp tempora roll, and they gave me shrimp tempora.  It's understandable how an error can occur...but then it took more time for the correction to be made and my bill wasn't corrected to the lower price, as the roll costs less.  Then I asked if the roll should come with eel sauce (as it does in every other restaurant) and I was just told no.  The service was just lacking...and again I've been there before and really enjoyed it...maybe its a place that you can sit down and eat, but I will never order out again.",

Despite notifying and reminding the waiter, chef and manager on multiple occasions, my daughter's birthday was ignored while another child, who was at our table, birthday was the focus of the entire meal. The other family even pointed out that there were two kids with birthdays at the table. That was a bummer - so much for going to Benihana for special occasions.   Also, the carpet is very dirty which makes you feel that other things may be neglected. That being said when you are sitting at the cooktop and the chef is doing a good job obeying all the food-handling regulations you worry less.   I ordered Seafood Diablo and several of the ingredients listed on the menu were missing. I asked for this spicy dish extra-spicy. My dish was cooked last (no big deal) but then when it was served and others were finishing, our waiter started working another table and I couldn't get a drink to save my life.    Also, I know the chefs have to learn but our chef was noticeably less skilled compared to the other chefs on shift this evening. That's just bad luck of the draw, but seemed to be the way this night was going. All in all, it was a very bad experience.",

My friend and my main course were already served. Yet, the appetizer was still not ready. I asked the waiter what was going on, and he told me that the kitchen was very back up. This wasn't his fault but I did end up canceling my order. Our server did come over to check up on us, but the entire time he was busy stocking up the bars for the night.   I'm probably come here again for the food....but definitely will not expect any great service. It was disappointing since I haven't been here for a while and hoping that things would change for the better. Apparently not",

NEVER again will I ever go here or any other Benihana location.  and to top it all off, our waiter was rude, careless, and seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. Definitely not a welcoming environment. below sub-par not worth $10 bucks to eat here let alone $70 we wasted here. serves me right to eat at the Mall location. I should've known better.",

And the (California Poppers) appetizer we ordered while waiting for out table was pretty tasty. Cheap (both meanings) sake during happy hour too. However, everything else about our experience was \"meh\" at best.  The dour-faced greeters didn't do much to foreshadow a good evening. And their \"lackluster\" temperament is the word I would use to describe most of our experience that night at Benihana.  The bartender was content to stare blankly into the distance; and the selection of beers was equally as drab as her personality. If I had it my way we would have walked out already. I could just tell from the attitude of the staff that this isn't an establishment that prides itself on...much anything at all. If the staff isn't excited (or even trying to fake it), then that speaks volumes about the quality of everything the restaurant does.  The food was edible. That's about it. Not very flavorful. Boring. They give you dipping sauces, but even these weren't fantastic. The \"show\" of our food being cooked was nice, and Scott was great, but the food was not. I've had better meals at national family restaurant chains...and at less than a quarter of the price.  What's the point of this Benihana? Is it supposed to be a place you try once to see the show? Cool. Done. No need to come back. Or is supposed to be a place where the food and service is so great that I can't wait to return? If so, they've got some serious work to do.",

After deciding what we wanted from the menu (two sushi rolls and entrees) our sushi came first. We tasted it and it was a tad dry so I figured id ask for some eel sauce. Our server was nowhere to be found for a good 10 mins. So i got up and asked for sauce from the sushi chef. Fine. After we finished our rolls, finally, about 15 mins later our salad and soup came out. Im not skilled with chopsticks and it took another 5 mins for our waiter to be spotted and more than 5 mins for forks. Plates werent cleared from our small table either. About 15 mins after we were done with soup ond salad our fried rice and shrimp came. By that time i was just ready to get out of there. I was annoyed. The food was good but didnt enjoy it because the service was so bad. After we ate i asked for the check and had to flag him down again to give him the card. I think they need to hire more servers. Service seems to be the biggest issue here. Very upset.",

Skip ahead 20 minutes and the whole host staff was able to find the reservation but it had been canceled in error. The host that canceled it admitted fault but they had no available tables. Naturally, I argued that we shouldn't have to suffer due to their error. The host girl said \"well, at least you don't have to wait an hour, be grateful.\" I was so appalled at the disrespect and awful customer service. Luckily we were able to find another establishment \"Osaka Japanese\" and they were able to seat us immediately and my niece had a great rest of her birthday.

    "text": "No. Not part of our usual lunch rotation. Not even close. Benihana might have been hip about the time Godzilla and Bruce Lee were in their prime. A time when Japanese cuisine might have come across as exotic to most Americans so all the mystical kung fu clown aspects of the Teppanyaki restaurant food preparation process were quite the spectacle and even a reason to come to a Benihana in the first place. Nowadays nobody other than some hermit from Appalachia would find this exotic. It is, unfortunately, old hat. So when a rep from a vendor that is currently figuratively bending us over and letting us have it like we were the proverbial large minority inmate's new bitch - decided to treat us to a lunch at Benihana it almost felt like a slight. Like hey you little short bus riders - you may find this spectacle awe-inspiring and a great lunch. Either that or maybe he really didn't know any better and finds the whole thing fascinating and awesome himself like he fell out of a short bus himself. So anyway we all show up at Benihana except for our department's resident tard (you know the type - there's at least one in every group) who we had to wait for because they would not start until ALL guests arrive. They wouldn't even SEAT us until he did. Pssht. Once he finally got there we were taken to our table where we pretty much were able to order immediately. Once all our orders were taken this guy comes over to our table and begins the show. He mumbled something in what was probably Japanese really quickly as he started and began his chopsocky cutlery show. His whole schtick was adding a sauce or spice and each time he added something he would pretend it was something else when he announced what he was doing - chocolate instead of soy sauce or gasoline instead of sake and so on. He chopped all of our vegetables up and he chopped all of our vegetables down. It was an ancient Japanese art and everybody knew their part. Everybody was... quite entertained. Food? Definitely had better. Benihana is for kids, you silly rabbit! After we were done eating it felt like the staff wanted us not to linger and GTFO so they could prepare for the next wave. Probably won't be back unless some other vendor decides to treat us like their bitch and bring us here for lunch. Plenty of parking as it shares a lot with other restaurants in the restaurant row on the south side of Chandler Blvd (just north of Chandler Fashion Center).",

    "text": "Benihana is the best place ever.  Keep in mind this is the kind of place that is not cheap, however there are more affordable choices if you look for them.   This location is pretty good however the waitresses are slow to refill drinks. You sometimes have to ask for refills because the waitresses are off talking to each other. Also I would suggest making reservations when you go. It is hit and miss crowded. Sometimes you go on a random Tuesday night and it's a 2 hour wait sometimes you can just walk in and sit down. If you make a reservation you aren't always seated right away, you typically have to wait at least 10 minutes, which is better than 2 hours.   The food is excellent, I recommend the seafood diablo dish and its only about 20 bucks! Its has scallops, shrimp,calamari, veggies and noodles. It is a little spicy but you can ask for them to not put on the sauce that makes it spicy.   Our chef was Scott and he happened to be the head chef. He was amazing and hilarious, unlike any chef we have had before.   To top it off, if you sign up on their website you get $30 to spend there on anything! AWESOME!",

    "text": "Everything about it was so wrong.  Don't waste your time or money here, it is very disappointing.    WAIT TIME:  We went for our daughter's 18th birthday mid-week.  The greeter knew this was for a special occasion.  We waited over an hour.  We even opted for the cook table for a faster seating, only to be offered to be seated at a tiny side bar with 4 chairs in a row near the prep area which we declined and continued to wait over 45 minutes more.    STAFF:  The entire staff seems very young and/or inexperienced, not apologetic or accommodating in any way.  I asked to speak to the manager and had to wait 20 minutes to talk to him.  After speaking to him he told me where I could wait- I had been present at the bar enjoying a beer after waiting for over an hour.  Rude.    FORGOTTEN ORDER:  The server forgot the order for my husband, so he waited with an empty plate most of the night until we had to say something to the chef.   If you see an empty plate in front of someone you are serving, would the chef or the waitstaff not be attentive enough to ask what that person ordered?    APPETIZER:  I ordered a dumpling at the bar when I was waiting there.  It was nothing special, we get the same kind at Sam's Club, frozen.   THE SOUP:  Very skimpy on ingredients.  Only some very thin green onion slices and one slice of mushroom.  Nothing special, tasted of water and soy sauce, that's about it.   The other party at our table asked for additional mushrooms.  Good for them and they were raw, the chef didn't offer to soften them. .   THE SALAD:  I enjoyed the Asian dressing.  This was okay.  It's kind of hard to mess up salad.  THE CHEF:  Seemed up tight.  He spent most of his time on the fried rice.  We ordered white rice and when ours came, it was colder than cold.    I ordered scallops, the menu said they were the sea variety which you expect to be large sized.  When they came they were on the small side, more like the bay variety.  No seasonings were put on these scallops and I had to ask the chef to please give me some onions.  He had served the scallops to me without anything else on my plate.   After 2 hours of waiting.  I would prefer to have the entire meal ready at the same time, promptly and correctly.   This was well after 8 p.m. by now.   UNDERCOOKED:  The zucchini was not well cooked, on the hard side.  He could have taken some time to steam it to soften it better, but all he did was fry it, which does not make for tender zucchini at all.  My husband ate most of this off my plate, as his plate was still empty.  He did not seem very into his cooking at all.  If you have ever tasted undercooked zucchini you know it is on the sour and rubbery side.  Yuck.  When things are prepared with a good attitude and with attention and care, they are a whole lot better in taste.  The chef dropped some of the utensils on the floor towards the end, he was very not into his craft.       REFILLS:  I could not get a refill of water and after all the salty soy water soup, I could have used it.  The server was not around much to check this for me.    SUMMARY:  Did I think this was worth it for a bowl of cold rice, rice water, a few tiny seared scallops, with 2 bites of hard zucchini and mostly a plate of caramelized onions?  What a rip off.  I should have stayed home!  The server tried to make up for his oversight with extra bowls of green tea ice cream.  Our daughter loves it, but I didn't care for the taste at all and neither did my husband.  So my daughter made out with 3 bowls; she does enjoy it.      CLEANLINESS:  The bathroom:  Yuck!  Trash on floor.  Dirty floors.    I won't be back anytime soon.   Zero stars if I could.",

They were not terribly busy at that time, but the restaurant soon filled up, I couldn't believe it on a Monday night the place was packed in a matter of an hour..  Service was great, quick, courteous, but the chef wasn't very entertaining.  He seemed to rush through preparation and was always very busy, but he only managed to cook one thing at a time.  I have been to many hibachi bars over the years and this particular chef wasn't very well organized.    The food was ok, not very flavorful.  I had the filet mignon and shrimp, both we're good, but a little on the bland side.  I was surprised to learn that the meal came with steamed rice, and if we wanted fried rice it was an extra 3.50 per person.    In the end the meal was pricey, and we didn't order anything from the bar.  Food was on the bland side, and the chef was not very entertaining, but the service from the wait staff was fantastic.  I can't give it more than 3 stars, there are better places to go for hibachi.",

    "text": "First, I love Teppanyaki restaurants. It is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants. Benihana was my second choice, but Option A was closed. Being a chain, I knew I had a good shot it would still be in business. I prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost, but Benihana is typically good and it is open.  There were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy. He was nice, but he wasn't as good as the ones at the other tables. This isn't him, because the other chefs didn't do it either, but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill. Probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire. Instead of volcano with flame, it was a train with smoke.   Benihana is more expensive than other places, but considering it is like dinner and a show, it isn't bad. The show part was not as good as it could be. The chef was okay and for the first timers with me, they thought it was good. The flavor of the food was okay, but not the best I have had. It was just kind of ho-hum for me. Interestingly enough after he was finished with our table, the chef went to another table that was all Asian customers. I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed.   For 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water, it was $65 ($80 after tip). A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food. I would recommend finding a smaller local establishment. At least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it.",

I went with my friends on a Thursday night, we had 6:30 pm reservations, we got their early so we hit the bar for happy hour, let me tell you I think I have found me a new drink!! The Mango Saketini!! Ohh mmmyy goodnesss its sooo yummy! Had me about 3 of them that night, man why is it that Thursday nights always feel like it should be a Friday,,,I don't get it.  We got to our table and come to find out their where 2 other birthday girls! So 3 at one table! Leos rule I say!   Our chef for the night was Roberto, he was cute and put on a good show, our servers I didn't catch their names, one was nice eye candy, ladies let me tell you Benihana's has some nice looking eye candy!  Of course our server kept calling me ma'am must have had my grandma gear on haha.  But about the food, let me tell you!! I ordered  1/2 rolls of the Boston & Philly sushi rolls, both where delish and so fresh, the salmon and tuna was soo dang good made me wish I ordered full rolls.  For dinner I ordered the hibachi steak, my friends ordered the Land n Sea and Deluxe Treat, now let me tell you  on the land n sea the scallops where buttery good and the shrimp appetizer, I don't even like shrimp, but was very sad to see mine was all gone, it was that good.  The lobster on the deluxe treat wasn't that good to me, it was fishy. The veggies where very fresh and grilled just right, I didn't care for the dipping sauce for the veggies, it was a little too salty for me.   But overall the place and the food were great! I'm guessing Benihana's from what I saw is the type of place you goto for a special occasion and the place had a great vibe and great staff, can't wait until I get to help celebrate a friend's birthday or whatever reason that brings me back to Benihana's...Shoot might just goto Happy Hour to get that dang Mango Saketini!",

I didn't even know you were allowed to sit children in the bar section, but they do. It ruined my lunch and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  Sushi can be hit or miss, especially when you live in the southwest,  but there's no reason to have to feel like you're eating in a McDonald's playground.",

We asked to share one Rocky but she said it was for one person so we changed it to two Rocky's. She submitted only one to the kitchen and when the chef came out he questioned the ticket saying two and quickly went and grabbed the additional meat. That's fine except that we did not get the other stuff that comes with it, rice, soup, salad, vegies, shrimp etc. only double meat and full price. Not good. The other thing that was not good was some young twenty something year old and her boyfriend thinking it's ok to stuff your new puppy in your Coach handbag and sit down to a dinner table. NO, it was not a medical issue puppy, it was just a pug puppy. Completely unacceptable behavior. The manager saw the puppy and did nothing. If I wanted to sit down and eat with dogs I would go to the park not to a somewhat fancy restaurant. There were several other mistakes with our food but it did taste good.",

Our chef was Seth and he made for quite an entertaining and enjoyable show for us.  As for the wait, we made a reservation at 8pm, got there at 7:55 and still waited about 30 mins, so that was disappointing. What was the point in a reservation, to prevent an hr wait?? Plus it was Tuesday, not a huge outing night.   Now the food on the other hand is not as great as I was expecting. This was my first time at Benihana and with the huge reputation and high food cost; I was really expecting the food to be better. It lacked seasoning and was mostly bland so needless to say it fell below my expectation and I failed to understand what the hype is about. Could've just been me and my families singular experience but that's my opinion.  Great fun, average food.",

    "text": "Every time I go to this Benihana, they lose 1 star and this time. I think I had enough and it went beyond the point even if I can get a free meal, I won't go back to this Benihana.  This time we went to celebrate my husband's birthday and we had the $30 certificate.  The quality of the sushi fish became worse. It's very watery, tasteless and not fresh but I won't complain much about it as there are many other sushi restaurants that serve the same quality of sushi in Phoenix. I think it's mainly because it's hard to get good fresh sushi grade fish in Phoenix although there are some Japanese restaurants that serve good fresh sushi.  The thing is their service. We waited about 15mins before the waitress took our order although we decided what we wanted to eat very quickly. She just didn't come back for that long.  Then she made a mistake in our order. My husband said \"Sushi and Sashimi combo\". She repeated the order as \"Sushi combo (without sashimi)\". So my husband corrected \"No, not Sushi combo, I would like to have Sushi and Sashimi combo\" and pointed out the item in the menu. She said \"okay\".   But.....yes, she brought the small \"Sushi combo\" instead of \"Sushi and Sashimi combo\". I told her it's not what my husband ordered. And surprisingly, she said \" I thought you ordered Sushi combo\"....and seemed she just wanted him to eat that. Hmmmm she \"thought\"..... So I told her my husband already corrected her mistake once by pointing out it in the menu. Then she said \"There must be some misunderstanding but I can change it.\" I thought \" Hmmmm....misunderstanding?\" I think it's a obvious mistake, though.  I didn't say anymore as my husband got what he ordered in the end and it was his birthday. In the end, she said \"Sorry for the misunderstanding\" and I think that is the best we could get from her.  After we finished our entrees, we again had to wait for about 30mins for the waitress to come by.  There's one thing we enjoyed which is the performance of the chef at our table.  So I give them 2 stars instead of 1.",

Parlayed that $30 into the Benihana Delight and of course, the chicken fried rice. Ordered ice water and grand total with 18% tip was $6.36. This can only be accomplished by using the solo dining option, therefore avoiding any female to bump up my tab. Oh yeah, this place will never get five stars unless they bring back the bean sprouts from the 90's. Lost another star due to that weird thing on the sides of colossal shrimp not being taken off properly. Had to peel those suckers off on my own. Huge bonus though for the chef keeping my steak on the grill until the last moment for well done status. I had to ask him twice not to take it off the grill, but I am probably one of a handful of people who would request this situation.     Funniest part of night was when young dude spilled entire glass of water on another woman at the table, not in his party. Hard not to laugh. This Benihana is also pretty ugly and needs a remodel - it looks like it's been awhile.     Oh yeah, the cute (but ditzy) blonde at the table had the best line. Chef puts some garlic Butter on the rice and calls it Japanese Peanut Butter and the girl (who didn't oder the rice) says, \"i never had japanese peanut butter, wonder how it tastes\"",

First, my daughter and I checked in and the hostess said to give them a moment...a moment later another hostess called my name and escorted us to a table that already had people sitting...no problem, in this type of restaurant you sit with strangers, it's part of the experience. Well the 2 empty seats were on each ends of the table and the host that was speaking to the table already seated would not ask them to shift in order to accommodate my daughter and I. So back to the front we went...thanks for the embarrassment. Next we were called by the host to follow him to another table and we were seated at the same time as another family...thank goodness for that! The family was super friendly so that helped a lot! Now for the food, they had a smaller 'Mother's Day' menu with only 2 sushi choices, both of which I didn't like. So I ordered filet and scallops while my daughter ordered shrimp and chicken. I'm sad to say the food lacked flavor...big time. The cook prepared our meals while he put on the typical show but I was extremely disappointed with the food. I came to AZ from Florida and they have Makotos and Fujiyama and I was looking forward to those types of favors in the food especially for a $84 bill for me and my daughter. We probably won't go back but we will try other Japanese teppanyaki style restaurants in the future. I give it 3 stars because the food is ehhhh and the host embarrassing us made it a horrible start but the nice family we sat with makes me feel the need to add the third star.",

I let her know I had a reservation and my name. She asked me if my party was all accounted for and I let her know we were still waiting for a few. Maybe 5 minutes to by and the rest of our group show up. I go back to the same girl and let her know. She looks at me and asks me if I have a reservation...Now during this down time nobody checked in or was sat. It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 and it wasn't very busy.  After I gave her my name again she let me know my reservation was for 7:45 and we would be sat shortly. So 18 minutes go by, yes I was timing it, and she comes over to me and asks me if I have a reservation and for my name... At this point I just shake my head and ask her if she is serious. One of the other girls calls my name for the group and we go back. Unfortunately I will not visit again on a Wednesday night because of sheer incompetence that is presented as the first experience a guest receives. I wish I could move past and give a better rating but this girl has zero customer service skills and that makes me sad.  During dinner a few tables were complaining of very slow service and at one point an entire table got up and left and it was a birthday party. Sorry Benihana it just wasn't your night.",

Our evening was closed off with a Vanilla Sundae and a picture of us together taken by the manager. Overall we had a GREAT Evening and would return again!",

We walked in at 3 pm on a Saturday so the place was not busy, and we were ignored by all 3 people standing at the host stand. When they finally decided to greet us, we were sat at the bar as we had requested. Everything went downhill from there. The bartender, \"DelBetty\" as she was named on the receipt was less than pleasant. She deliberately ignored us for a few minutes before greeting us by saying \"are you waiting for a table\"? We were the only people in the bar, so you would think she would have been happy to have some customers. Her attitude and lack of personality couldn't have pushed us out sooner. To top it off the food sucked too. BYE Benihana.   Overall rating = D, for DON'T eat here.",

    "text": "Teppanyaki is not really my favorite style of cooking. I always feel it's a little over priced because the food itself is pretty boring but you are paying more money since the chef puts on a show for you. It can be a fun experience if you are with the right people and in the mood for it but I have never really been wowed by a meal at one of these places. Our last experience at a teppanyaki place up in Flagstaff was so awful that I was not really looking forward to our dinner at Benihana but we had received a gift card for Christmas so we decided to go ahead and give them a try.  Style wise, the place is on par with the other restaurants around Chandler mall. Nice looking but somewhat trite Asian decor. Not surprisingly, they were quite busy on a Saturday night and we had to wait at the bar a little while for a table. While we were sitting there, I observed that there were a surprisingly amount of families there. I would have thought that this was not type of place you would bring kids, partially because of the hibachi grill and also the price. But there were a ton of kids of all ages. Most of the families were on their way out, though, and the late night crowd was arriving. This seems to be a popular date spot for college age couples. There was a good lively crowd in the bar area so we didn't really get a whole lot of attention from the bartender... they definitely need to staff up behind the bar. Since I found the wine and beer list very lacking, I decided to try a couple of their specialty cocktails. These were mediocre at best. The Cucumber Collins had a good, fresh flavor to it and was pretty enjoyable but it could have done with a little more lemon and less club soda. I decided to switch to something stronger and so made the mistake of ordering a Beni-Tini. This drink was overly sweet and not enjoyable at all. I could not detect any hibiscus flavor so I have to assume that they use a syrup rather than brewed tea. If you like sweet drinks this may work for you but I guess I should have just ordered a regular martini. I did notice they had some top shelf (well, mid-shelf anyway) liquor bottles so next time I'll just stick to the basics.  Once we were finally seated, my hubby and I had no complaints about our chef or the food. The mushroom soup was tasty, though it took me by surprise since most restaurants like this serve Miso Soup as a starter. I also really enjoyed the salad; it had plenty of other vegetables, not just lettuce, and the dressing was really good. The hubby got a surf and turf thing with steak and jumbo shrimp. I tried one of his shrimp and they were very sweet and delicious, much better than the smaller ones we all got included with our meals. (Those were cooked well, but just inferior quality shrimp). For my entree, I ordered a noodle dish, Seafood Diablo. This was not as spicy as I was hoping and the sauce was a bit too greasy for me (lots of oil on my plate when I was done) but overall it was good. The seafood all tasted delicious and I was actually amazed that chef managed to make sure that the squid, shrimp, etc in my dish didn't get overcooked while at the same time tending to everyone else's chicken and steak. We ended the meal with the fried banana dessert with vanilla ice cream and a scoop of chocolate on the side for me. We were both pretty happy with that!  Overall, this is not the best teppanyaki place I've been to but it is far from the worst. I would probably eat here again if I was with a group who picked it but I wouldn't necessarily suggest it myself.",

    "text": "Let's call Benihana for what it is: Expensive entertainment. We took our family to celebrate a birthday (which it appears everyone does this as we heard the birthday song screamed about the restaurant through the entire evening) and were seated with another couple (they do their best to fill all seats around the grill). Our 6-year old daughter LOVED the \"performance\" - the onion volcano of fire being her favorite part. And she tried everything, which was really cool to see! Our server was a little bit impatient or short with us, not saying more than a few words- but she was attentive and always made sure our water glasses were kept full along with our alcohol orders.   It's fun watching the \"show\" as your food is cooked in front of you. Our chef had a good personality and chatted through the evening, making small talk and cracking jokes while he prepared our orders. The table ordered shrimp, filet, and chicken with fried rice (you gotta get the fried rice) so we all had plenty to eat. I believe most meals are served in five courses. You'll start off with a Japanese onion soup, move to a ginger dressed salad, then on to fried rice, the main course (protein with grilled vegetables) and finally served a scoop of ice cream. It's a lot of food but your given plenty of time to enjoy it. Between the ordering, setup, show, and eating prepare for a 2+ hour experience. But again, it's fun and the entertainment is what you are paying for. The food is obviously fresh since it's cooked right in front of you, but you are limited to your options outside of the protein.  Our party of five, with drinks, ran about $300 with tip so it's not a cheap meal. Benihana is one of those \"every 5 years on a special occasion\" kind of places. See you in another five years!",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews but this was ridiculous. My fiance and I have one night a week where we don't have our children and we decided to spend it at this location. The table that we sat at had an employee who was off work that day, and her boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday. To start off, the boyfriend had his tire slashed in the parking lot apparently by an employee of Benihana over some drug dealing dispute. This was all told to us by the other employees while the two came and went from our table frequently from going outside, to calling the police.   So then, the police showed up inside to investigate what happened. They were right next to us inside the lobby area discussing all while our chef was making the food. My fiance and I, as well as another couple are confused at this point and a little bothered that there's so much commotion by our table.   The couple returns to the table while the police are still there in the lobby. The boyfriend yells at the chef and said he wanted his food well done. The chef said that he wasn't there to tell him how he wanted it done so he played it safe. The boyfriend began yelling at the chef and then we defended the chef by saying he wasn't there and it wasn't right to do that. He then began yelling at us (by the way, he was very drunk and maybe high) and at my fiance. The girlfriend who is also an employee at the location then started cursing at us, and the other couple.   The police had to come over and break up everything and asked the couple to leave. The boyfriend threatened us on the way out and eventually cursed at us in the parking lot on our way out. His girlfriend (the employee) was arrested in the parking lot.   To top it off, the manager came over and only offered us 25% off of our bill! We paid (a little over $100) for something that was absolutely atrocious and I will likely never return here if it wasn't for our amazing chef Kevin and the waitress Shizuka (spell check)! Thank you both. 5 stars for the chef and waitress, 0 stars for the leadership team! :(",

    "text": "Even before you walk inside, the atmosphere is created by the exterior of the restaurant which is made to look like a Japanese-style building. When greeted with staff, you notice that they are wearing special outfits that appear to be from Japanese culture with symbols on them. This small addition adds a touch of sophistication to the restaurant, making you feel as if you're getting the full cultural experience.  At a good restaurant, there should be background music playing just loud enough to be noticed, but not loud enough to the point you have to raise your voice to speak to your friends and family.  At Benihana, there was no music playing at all. Whether that means the music was too soft of there was none at all, I would have liked more music to be playing as I was enjoying my food.   At a restaurant with good service, I expect a server who is respectful, attentive, asks how the quality of food is, and does things in a timely manner. During my experience at Benihana, the waitress was pretty attentive, coming by a decent amount of times, but when it came to quickness and accuracy of what was needed, the service was not up to par. For example, my friend asked for lemons for her water, and only after she asked three times did she receive them. While taking our food order, the waitress wasn't able to understand exactly what we wanted, and when she offered her opinion, was rude about it.  The chef was pretty cool... He also was very involved with the whole table, asking everyone what they needed and catering to what they asked. What made his service above average was that he got personal with us, getting involved in our casual conversations and giving his interesting input on whatever we were talking about. At other restaurants, they chefs can be tired, not wanting to do the usual tricks or lazy, and not interacting with the customers. This aspect of Benihana was definitely above average compared to most other teppan-style places.  Compared to other restaurants with the same style, overall Benihana is an okay restaurant that has some good qualities that make for a good dining experience. Although they need to work on some things such as music, parking, and service, I would suggest Benihana to families and couples looking for more casual yet interesting dining experience.",

Then our chef showed up, and right when he started the \"show\", he accidentally tossed a spatula into my daughters lap. From there, no tricks at all! It was a 110% boring experience.  The entire table (my husband, my 2 kids & I), and another family of 4) sat there quiet waiting for some kind of entertainment from the chef to take place. That's what Benihana is all about, right!? And to top it off, the food was under seasoned and had no flavor.  I honestly think our chef was new, and needed some training. But in that case, he shouldn't be placed on the floor on the busiest day of the week (Saturday). We paid over $220, and it was not even worth it... I'm sorry to say. :-(",

Some pieces almost tasted spoiled to me. Few things worse than gross sushi to me. The fish just looked cheap and sloppy. The tuna roll was the same thing, the quality of fish just ruined it.   25 bucks on lunch isn't too common, so I expected a high quality lunch. Left with a bad fish taste in my mouth. Not cool bro",

Its now close to 7pm and I am starving. We ended up eating things randomly as they came: a bowl of fried rice. Then a few shrimp. Then a slice of zucchini. My four scallops. The onions and mushrooms kept cooking on the grill and I wound up eating bites of plain steak because I did not want them to get cold in the interim.   I watched the others play pass the baby down the line because our chef barely spoke with us. I had more fun watching the table next to us being served.    Its after 8pm at this point. I am waiting for our check and asking for the dessert to go because I don't think I can sit here any longer. $80 with tip and I even used a birthday coupon.   There's a lot of \"maybe's\" here: maybe the chef was new. Maybe the girl up front was new. Maybe three hours to eat a meal is a long time.  Maybe I should have asked for a no kid table since I left my THREE kids home so I could enjoy my dinner. I am disappointed. MAYBE they can do better if I decide to come back. Maybe...",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This place wavers between 3.5 and 4 stars, depending on who's doing the cooking.  In the world of teppanyaki, this place is definitely better than Kobe in Tempe, but it is not as good as Tanaka of Tokyo in Hawai'i (although the wait there, even with a reservation, can be ridiculous.)  My wife and I come here twice a year, every year, for our birthdays.  (Free $30 when you sign up for their e-club.)  Occasionally we'll bring a guest who wants to go.  The quality really does depend on the chef that day, so the quality can be uneven.  We don't come for the \"show\" anymore, seen too many.  But if you have kids, they will enjoy it.  You don't come for an amazing steak.  You come to get a decent sized meal and a serviceable steak for around $32.  We will say, the chicken fried rice is typically amazing, you just have to ask them to really go heavy on the garlic butter.  Even with a reservation, the most we've waited is 20 mins.  We've also been seated immediately, it all depends on where the chefs are at in their table rotation.  Service has been fine for us, though the staff typically looks like they're running around to cover all their tables.    Like I said, you're not coming for a phenomenal meal, and without the free $30, I'm not sure I'd go so high as to give 4 stars, but as it stands, it's a decent steak and sides with great fried rice for a reasonable price.",

We arrived and waited just a few minutes to be sat.  Unfortunately, they tried fitting us on a corner of an already full table. I am short and petite, but my boyfriend (who was celebrating his birthday) is 6'5 and over 300 pounds. We did not fit well in that corner and felt cramped.  Our waitress was nice, the chef was entertaining and skilled, and the food was delicious (especially for how picky my boyfriend is). The chef cooked everything perfectly. There were times that refills took too long to come through and other random requests because our waitress seemed overwhelmed. Our chef even had to call for her.  We finished off with some ice cream and an acapella version of Happy Birthday (because there were no available singers). We did not get our picture taken nor did our waitress ever come back so I could ask her about it. I was disappointed.  I will come back, as this location is nicer than Scottsdale's, but the service was below average. Please improve!",

    "text": "Okay so I went here for my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend and I made a reservation so they were aware. Also a guy at my table was celebrating his birthday so you'd think we'd get exceptional service. Nope not even close. I want to give them 1 star but my waiter Gregory was trying his best to keep us happy. First of all my boyfriend doesn't eat meat which I clearly stated in my reservation and when I mentioned it to hostess she seem clueless on what to do. I mentioned it to my waiter then and he stated he would let the chef know and give my bf extra veggies to suffice for no meat. Hence the reason I loved him. The chef comes out. He didn't seem to understand because the first thing he throws on the grill is chicken and throws the egg for my bfs rice right next to it. So I stop my waiter because I don't wanna be rude to chef. I just confirm is he aware my bf doesn't eat meat so therefore meat product shouldn't be cooked with his food. He then whispers to chef which the chef gets very snappy and says they aren't touching and kinda gets a attitude with me and the waiter about it. All in all. The experience was horrible. The chef name was Juan he just threw food on the griddle which chicken grease was popping all over my bfs rice he just chose not to eat it. But it made me really upset because he's paying all this money to not eat because of this careless chef. My bf didn't want me to complain anymore so I let it go. However there were no tricks done, he simply cooked the food and exited as if he hated his job. As I'm watching other tables get the full experience we didn't receive half of that service. Very disappointed at the service and at the chef. They shouldn't be allowed to just cook and leave. At least make the experience enjoyable for the patrons. No one at the table tipped him that's how bad it was and usually everyone tips a good chef. I wanted to call and complain but my bf said no so I'll just leave a yelp review. I wish their managers read these. Truly. But again my waiter was over worked and still tried to make it the best experience for us and accommodate my bf the best he could. & I really appreciated that just wish the chef cared enough about non meat eating customers.",

We sat at the table and waited until 8:50 pm and was finally told by our server that the chefs are behind and won't be with us for another 30 minutes. We asked to see a manager to simply ask why wasn't we notified when we first arrived for our reservation that the chefs were behind to give us the option if we wanted to stay or not. The manager was very rude and unapologetic and nonchalant about the situation so we decided to leave. On our way out we asked the hostess for the store number.  The manager told the hostess not to speak to us and to leave the front counter. He also told us to leave. We replied we will gladly leave all we want is the store number. He then proceeded to call the police on us and told the police we were yelling in his face, harassing, insulting and threatening him. He also stated that we were drunk although we didn't even have a chance to enjoy our drinks because we left the table before doing so. I do believe that him calling the police on a group of black females was racially motivated. We was not once rude nor did we raise our voice. We simply would've left if he would've gave us the store number. The cops finally arrived and the manager choose to ban us from the restaurant. Before this incident, Benihana's was truly my family's favorite restaurant but after being treated this way by the manger we will never eat there again.",

The \"enticing\" $30 birthday certificate allows you the $30 off their teppan specialties with a purchase of a full price teppan dish Monday through Thursday.   Cocktail: Benihana Plum Wine - from Berkeley (me thinks) $7.50 for the glass. This is a regular plum wine.   Specialties:  6 course meals comes with: Onion and mushroom soup, salad, sauteed shrimp, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served with their mustard sauce and ginger sauce. Steamed rice. Hot green tea. ice cream or sorbet.   My pick: Deluxe Treat $38. - Filet mignon (medium rare) and a cooked lobster tail with garlic butter and lemon. This is a normal surf and turf meal cooked before your eyes.   The teppan chef first started with cleaning the teppan top. Oil, then made the beating heart fried rice (which is an optional for an additional $5). Next up is cooking the zucchini, mushrooms and making the onion volcano and choo-choo train. Then was the chicken, steak, filet mignon and lobster tails.   Menu books changed from the nicely bounded one to the economical thin and easily replaceable, cleanable menu books.   Overall: 0-star rating Minus a star: Server failed to provide the hot green tea.  Minus a star: Server forgot about the ice cream.  Minus a star: Server didn't take, nor offer the birthday pictures Minus a star: Server never refilled waters Minus a star: Server messed up the checks  I doubt the birthday recipients enjoyed the birthday experience.

She had to be the most disrespectful and rudest person I've ever encountered in the restaurant business. Her attitude and demeanor reflected poorly on the restaurant and if I was Benihana corporate, I'd sue her for representing my company so badly.  My family and I immediately walked out and I proceeded to call the manager from my cell phone. The person who answered the phone claimed to be the manager and apologized to no end about the poor treatment we received. She took my name & number down and promised to call me back the next day in order to get my mailing address because she promised a gift certificate in response to the issue. Its been 3 days since we visited this location and still no phone call from that manager.  I am making it a point to contact their corporate office to advise them about how this location operates.",

    "text": "Benihana is usually a good time, but our most recent visit fell short. After being seating almost 30 minutes after our reservation time, we waited another 45 minutes for the chef. The food was great, but our waiter seemed to be struggling. He forgot several things on the chef's cart (which annoyed the chef), failed to bring the complimentary dessert (ice cream) to everyone at our table, and seemed frantic and rushed the entire meal. When it came time to check out, he returned our booklet without returning the credit card used for payment. We got up to look for the waiter and found the credit card on the ground, under another table across the restaurant. Overall, our Sunday night out turned into a frustrating, three-hour endeavor. Disappointing visit at this location.",

    "text": "The last 3 times we went was terrible. we were Seated at our table more than 30 minutes after our reservation time everytime. There were Ants @ our table. The Server broke a plate and there were glass shards everywhere.  The most recent visit was the worst in my opinion. The Manager talking rudely and degradingly to the hostess. After waiting 30 minutes after our reservation time, we were seated and then we were forced to wait an additional 20 minutes because the remaining 4 people being seated with us didnt want to come from the bar. Our food wasnt cooked the way we ordered it. Our server had a bad attitude with us and really wasnt around much when we needed a refill on our drinks or things of that sort. We didnt get silverware to eat with until we had already had most of our food on the plate getting cold. There was old food on the floor under our table. When there was a birthday the manager would run around the table shaking a tambourine in people's faces and around there heads while yelling the song abnoxiously. Next time we would like to eat at Benihana we will travel the additional 45 minutes to the Scottsdale location to see if they are any better but that also means less visits to benihana because we will not want to travel that far. The chandler location is already a ways to drive for us.",

I've gone twice to the website for Benihana to make a complaint and no one has ever contacted me back. The experience was for a birthday and several of members of my family had never been there so this experience was not the greatest",

When I asked for the manager, she decided to \"fix the situation\" by taking the fried rice off the bill--just the fried rice. I couldn't believe it. Also, they should offer an option to sit at a table without children--what a great way to destroy a nice dinner.",

Someone asked me what if they sat me (and they mix tables up. .. doubt that they were all full) and reservations came in? then they would have five upset people because they didn't keep their reservation.    Well I was explaining on my review earlier, that I was upset that they booked so many reservations that they couldn't seat any walk ins for an hour and half.   Think about it.   No one was waiting in lobby.   People were walking out.   You don't overbook reservations like that.   You always make sure to have room for the walk ins.   Doesn't matter how busy or popular your restaurant is.  That is bad for business.   Unless it's Valentines or Mothers day.  You don't see that kind of response from a restaurant.    They have tons of tables.   And they were all full with reservations???? And the fact that my group was just two.   And they mix tables.   Hello???",

Word of advice for her. If you can't smile, be cordial, have a personality then quit and find another line of work but obviously interacting with the public is not your calling.   Very long wait to eat.... The servers are slow and you have to wait forever just to get drinks and refills...  I think for $100 I can spend it elsewhere and get better service and food...",

(I asked twice when we could expect to be seated and mentioned the fact that we work early and would rather reschedule our reservation if it was going to be much longer and I was assured both times that our table was \"almost ready.\") Once seated we placed our drink orders and later our food orders. Our chef was alright, although the \"show\" is the same every time at Benihana. Our server, on the other hand, was terrible. Our foursome was empty on beverages for the entirety of the night. I shouldn't have to flag someone down three times to beg for a glass of water when I'm paying $30 bucks for each tiny portion of food. Now for the GOOD STUFF. After I finished eating, I ran to the bathroom. What I saw in there was worse than most porta-potties. Every stall was clogged with feces and the floor was a sticky, wet mess. There was blood smeared on one of the toilet seats. Honestly, I don't feel we got anywhere near our money's worth this time and I doubt we will ever be back. Terrible service, filthy bathrooms and floors, and subpar food. Would not recommend to my worst enemy.",

    "text": "I'd never been to Benihana so I was excited to try it. My cousin comes here every year for his birthday and suggested it when I was in town.  Upon entering, we were told that there would be a 2 hour wait (not sure if this is the norm, but it was around 7 PM on a Sunday) so we decided to seat ourselves in the lounge, which was relatively empty. A server came to us soon after we sat down, which was nice.  My cousin and I got sushi for ourselves and I ordered hibachi chicken rice, chicken yakisoba meal, and rainbow and salmon rolls to take home to my family. At the restaurant, we had the crunchy roll, spider roll, 1964 roll, and Gotham roll. The crunchy roll was by far the best; the Gotham roll was okay but not especially fresh-tasting or flavorful. I was not a huge fan of the other two.  My take-home order was placed on a piece of paper which they rewrote to confirm when the bill was brought to me. I had asked for two orders of the hibachi chicken rice which was also indicated on the paper written by the server but only one was brought out. I was not charged for the second one (which was my fault because I didn't check the receipt clearly and assumed the order was correct based on the paper they wrote). However, it didn't take them long to bring the second one out, even though they kind of had an attitude about it.  My father was disappointed in the rice; brother said the yakisoba was good but the soup that came with the meal was simply terrible. He took one sip and wanted to throw the rest out. Mom was okay with her sushi except... the salmon roll had a TON of bones in it. To me, this is unacceptable. I understand finding an occasional bone in a fish dish but having so many bones in a simple roll is terrible to me.  Would have given 3 stars, because service throughout the meal was good and the food was okay. Removed a star due to all the bones found in the salmon roll.",

    "text": "This used to be 4 stars, but last night things took a dive...  Here's why.  We've eaten at Benihanas 5 times in about the last year.   None of these times involved sharing a table with \"questionable\" people.  Let's just say they appeared to be oblivious to the fact that anyone else was in the room.  I don't want loud braggarts at my table.  I simply do not want to see fat parents let their fat kids suck down 4 sodas each.  It made me feel complicit in the poor upbringing of those kids.  There was more, but this was the first time we'd had to share a table with people we completely disliked.  There happened to also be possibly the noisiest woman on the planet in the dining room at the same time.  It made our experience less fun.    Not the restaurants fault, but it's something to consider.  Now, onto the next reason... Somehow, and for some reason, they did things out of order this time.  They served the soup, the the shrimp and fried rice, then the salad, then the entree, and finally the vegetables.  Issues with this:  (1) Mostly because I am used to soup, salad, shrimp/rice, vegetables, entree, dessert.  (2)  They didn't serve dessert.  It wasn't offered.  Nobody asked for it, so I thought maybe they took the free ice cream off the menu.  We did get ice cream because my daughter had a birthday.  I've got to check on that for future reference.  (3)  My entree, (The Trio which has Filet Mignon, chicken and shrimp) was prepared first, alongside someones lobster.  I was served all 3 of my meats before my daughter's entree was even started.  Before I was halfway done my food was cold!  This is not how it's ever been done.  Plus, I don't think I actually got a filet this time.  It was a pretty crappy cut of meat     Then there was a consistency issue between the chef we got this time than any other time.  This chef was stingy on the salt and soy sauce and butter.  Which is ok in my book, but restaurants need to keep it consistent.    Last reason, and this may have been done before and my husband never noticed, but they add a tip to your bill, even if it's just 2 of you.  And it's a small line item.  Nobody points it out.  I happened to pay in cash and they gave me the kind of change you would get if you needed to leave a tip.  Whether True or not, it appears they are trying to get extra tip out of the customer.  And that's bad.  We'll give them one more shot before we write them off entirely.  As I said,  this was pretty good before.",

The Sashimi was really good with big slices and the Sushi was very yummy. Due to this, I ordered Sashimi Combination again for my another visit.   Most people go there for the Teppanyaki. However, don't miss out their Sashimi and Sushi as well.",

Also I found their meat and rice to be much drier than other Benihana locations I have been to.  I love Benihana, just not this location.  If you feel up to the drive I would suggest skipping this one and heading north to the Scottsdale location.  If not there are a few local Teppanyaki places in Chandler that are just as good and cheaper.",

We've been to this location twice and the food was great both times. Shizuka was amazing. We never had to wait for drinks the entire night. Jorge's food was great, but his show was the best. My wife and I have had Hibachi many times before, but his performance was outstanding. We went to the one in Scottsdale first, but the one in Chandler is much better if you get the right people. Jorge made us feel like we were at a table with friends, rather than being served. Well done, and we'll be back.",

I made reservations and was greeted and sat within minutes. We were seated at a table with another family who were celebrating their daughter's birthday. The food is in the $30 - $40 price range and come with soup and salad. Our orders were taken pretty quickly. The food was good but nothing fantastic. I realize that part of the cost is the \"show\". The chef seemed hurried and barely cracked a smile. The entire point of coming here is the \"show\". Once the chef started, the waitress disappeared so if you want another beer, order before the chef starts.  Once dinner was served, we were hurried along. For $110 for two people (2 entrees, 2 beers, an iced tea, and the fried rice up sell) I expected more.",

    "text": "I love Japanese food. I love anything Japanese. The culture everything. I really want to go there one day. I even have my own pair of chop sticks in a fancy box. I also love Teppanyaki. I would eat just about anything cooked on a hibachi grill. I would love to have one built into a counter in my dream house. Now I know Benihana's is a corporate place but I think they are great. Are they the best ever? Probably not. I'm sure there are places out there that could cook circles around them and put on a better show. But for what it is it is pretty good. It is a little on the pricey side and definitely not a place you would go to even once a month. It is definitely a special occasion place. You can tell that from the 8 renditions of Happy Birthday that you will here while you are there. I have heard it so much I have the Japanese version they also sing memorized and I can't even speak Japanese. But I would love to learn. That is the top tip for this place by the way. Whatever you do join the Benihana Chef's Table Club. So worth it. A free $30 gift certificate for your Birthday month. How can you beat that. I have been here many times and I was here again last night with my girlfriend and a friend. It was my friend and I's last free Birthday thing. There are a lot of places that will give you free stuff on or around your Birthday. This was the last one we had and we went out with a bang. Sam was our cook and he is one of the better ones. He puts on a good show with funny jokes and is a very excellent cook. You start with a mushroom and onion soup, which I think is great, then a salad with their fantastic dressing on it, move on to shrimp appetizer, grilled onions, mushrooms and zucchini. Another tip, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the chicken fried rice. Sure it is $3.50 extra but so worth it. The little bowl looks small but you swear it never ends. So good. Love their chicken fried rice. Did I mention I love Japanese food. I ordered the steak and scallops. The steak melts in your month and the scallops are buttery good. Everything was great. I love their mustard sauce. It goes best with the steak and seafood. So good. I usually have to ask for more because I use it all up. Sam did his usual great job of cooking. My girlfriend had not been to a Benihanas in about 5 years. She thought it was good but maybe not quite worth the price. I do agree it is pricey but it is so good. In my opinion. I probably won't be back until next year but I will be back. I love Japanese food if I didn't mention that.",

So disappointed that I just couldn't keep eating it anymore for the sake of being full.  I actually went somewhere else, because I was still hungry, and got a sandwich.    The reasons why I didn't enjoy my meal:  1.  Rice was super mushy.  Eventually, every sushi they served me had medicre rice, which totally ruined the whole meal.   2.  They put so much rice in their sushi so that AYCE diners will get full sooner.   I actually had to tell the sushi chef to kick back on the rice. 3.  The fish was not as fresh as I am used to in Southern California.  One of the servers told me that this was a common complaint by non-local diners.   Needless to say, I didn't go back here during my remaining 3 days.  I actually preferred the Japanese mall food court restaurant over this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Benihana...but this one failed me.",

    "text": "Benihana of Chandler is RIDICULOUS!!!!   Four of us were meeting for dinner at 6 pm.  I wanted their new Tempura basket (just got their e-mail advertising it) - not a chef's table needed item.  So I made reservations on-line and said I didn't need the Chef Table, figured why tie up 4 seats at a Chef's table.  I get there @ 5:50 to be told they don't take reservations for non chef tables which are actually in the lounge.  I go in there to see 3 regular tables...2 taken and another \"reserved\" how is that so?  The hostess says we can have the center table a large high stool pub table.  REALLY?  With a seven year old?  Let alone who wants to have a nice quiet meal in the \"bar\" with your feet dangling?     Walked out and had a nice meal at Chili's next door!  From now on going to Scottsdale Benihana where they have a nice non-lounge and non-chef table area for people to have a quiet dinner...that's what I expected at Chandler.    Also, they told me they tried to reach me.  No phone call, text or e-mail all day.  Come home to find they canceled my reservation at 5:53 (what while I was standing there?) CRAPPY customer service!",

    "text": "This was a GREAT experience.  We went in for our anniversary so it had to be good.  First the greeters were actually friendly and accommodating.  We had our reservation but we were a bit late, so they had to wait to get a group together.  6 minutes.. not really bad wait. Our waitress, Cheryl was great.  She was friendly, efficient and just all around on the ball.  Kept our table's drinks filled constantly and made sure we all had what was needed.   The cook was Jeff.  He was fantastic. I am allergic to lemon and he remembered and cooked my food without while cooking everyone else's food.  He went overboard to give the birthday person at the table a pleasant experience.  The food was great.  Best tasting I have had in any Benihanas in a long time.  We travel a lot so we have been to a lot of them.  Can not say enough good about Jeff. When we were looking for a specific mug Cheryl actually found not one but three (one for each of us) That is hard to do since this on we have not seen in very many places.    The Bad:  IF you are not use to places like this the price could be a bit shocking.  BUT For all the food that we got and the quality, it was really worth it.  If you go in thinking you are getting cheap Japanese or Chinese food, go elsewhere because this is not that low quality.    Summary:  We have been to a lot of Benihana and this one is one of the best.  Phoenix lucky to have this one.  We have only been to one other that equals this one and it was in California.  Food was great, service was great and friendly the place had a great atmosphere.  As stated, if you want cheap fast Oriental food, this is not the place, if you want a great dining and entertainment in this type of place this is where to go.  We will return more often and hope this was not one off great experience.  For those who thought the butter is Garlic Butter.. it is not.  They make (and everyplace else does also) Makes it out of HONEY BUTTER. If you want more Butter, just ask the Chef (at least this on did) for more butter to be added, same with all dishes with butter.  If one is early for a reservation, do not expect to be seated right away, they have to plan seatings.  Best thing to do (HINT) do not tell them you have a reservation UNTIL almost time for you reservation, thus you can maybe get seated better and then cancel you reservation, if you do not then you still have your time slot.  It is just polite to not demand you be seated ahead of your time.  If you have a meeting scheduled at work, and you go early, do not expect people to be there, if you leave because you were there and they were not they will still have the meeting at the scheduled time.  This is a place of business and one should schedule the time and honor it. Politeness goes both ways. Maybe that is why our experience was better than others.  Go someplace grumpy and get bad service you get what you sow.",
