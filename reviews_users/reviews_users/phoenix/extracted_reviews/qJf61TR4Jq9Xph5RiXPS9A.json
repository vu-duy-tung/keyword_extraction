    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place. So many people really seem to enjoy this eatery, but I was not impressed.   The atmosphere of the location isn't bad- though I've attempted to eat here on the weekend, only to be forced to sit outside in the sun because there was no room to eat inside, and apparently it never occurred to them to let me wait for a table (I ended up leaving before eating during that visit).   This time, though, there were few people in the restaurant. It was nice and quiet. The service, in my opinion, was rather slow despite the lack of patrons. I ended up ordering a hot tea and a ham, egg & cheese crepe.   The tea was okay. It looks like they're using a higher quality tea, but it tasted a lot like tap water to me- so I ended up tasting more of the water and less of the tea.   The crepe was bad. I couldn't even finish mine. It was soggy and reminded me of a tortilla more than a crepe.   And on top of that, no one bothered to ask if everything looked okay. If the food was good, or if I or my companion needed anything.   I'd rather go eat at the crepe bar instead.",

The sign said \"Please Seat Yourself,\" but we were asked to wait. Fine. Two women came in after us and were clearly regulars. We stood there for about 10 minutes before we were seated. The women who came in after us were acknowledged and told to pick a table and we were asked to pick the table they didn't pick. Hmmm, really?? We came in first and they knew that.  The food was \"alright.\" Nothing great. Overall, the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. You would think they would welcome new customers (especially local businesses), but apparently they don't need or want any. If the food had been phenomenal, I could look past the service, but that was not the case. I am sure they will do fine without my business, but I can't help but share my opinion with the social media world. Needless to say, there's no need to go back.  One more thing:  They have the word avocado spelled incorrectly in multiple locations on the menu. This does not look professional at all.",

Our actual server Terry was friendly it was the service from the people around her dropping off the food that was more on the rude side.    I would come back 1 more time as maybe it was an off day.  Update May 7th: my wife my mom and I went there today to try this again see if service was any better but it was worse. We sat down and waited quite a while no coffee no nothing just menus dropped off.   Then we looked around and realized how many tables were still waiting on food and there's only one chef on duty it was time to leave so we left.   Too bad because we really enjoyed the food. Changed to 2 stars because of service.",

I have had a few different crepes (Chicken Supreme, Blueberries and Cream Cheese, Apple Cinnamon and I think I had an Egg, cheese and Bacon one). I have to say for the savory ones, the Chicken Supreme is awesome, fresh smell and taste of the Pesto and spinach with Mozzarella is a great combo.  I've seen some reviews about the service being slow or bad but I guess it depends on your expectations. I go here after hiking at South Mountain and I am not in a rush for anything. I was going there 1 to 2 times a week for a few months but recently haven't had the time to make over there. Instead of coming out to refill my iced tea they started just leaving a small pitcher on the table for me and my friends which I preferred. At the end of our meal they provided to go cups for the iced tea too. So, to me the service was good.  If it wasn't 20-25 minutes from me, I would still be going there weekly.",

The ones we tried were the turkey pesto, a breakfast cheese, avocado & mushroom, and from the sweet menu, The Shirley. All 3 were so delish!!  One thing that we noticed, being mushroom lovers, is they did not skimp on the mushrooms. One of my biggest peeves is when go to order a mushroom dish & you only get like three or four in your entree. The mushroom crepe was loaded :) and it was very much appreciated!!  All the crepes were good portions. All were cooked perfectly, not over or undercooked. Our sweet one, The Shirley, we were able to split between three of us! Perfect finish to our meal :) Great service and atmosphere as well! Good job Cupz N' Crepes! We will certainly be returning!",

The crepe is a little bit tough and thick, but I think it might be by design because they pack so much real ingredients in it that it needs to be able to hold them in.  I ordered The Shirley with banana. It is Cream Cheese, Nutella, Strawberries w/ Whip Cream & Chocolate Sauce. I wanted some banana with it to make it even more tasty. It was huge and delicious~ I think it should be considered healthy since I had strawberries and banana... :P  My hubby ordered Graceland (Peanut Butter, Bananas & Honey) and a Bacon Egg & Cheese breakfast crepe. Both were delicious.   Bacon Egg & Cheese was very satisfying for breakfast. Graceland hit the spot for my hubby's peanut butter craving.

The food we ordered was pretty average. After we were done eating and our table was cleared I mentioned we had a coupon and she told me, \"We'll have to take care of it at the counter.\"  She never came by with the check and when I got up and asked if I paid at the counter she seemed annoyed and said something under her breath that made both my husband and I a little uncomfortable.    I don't think we will be coming back here, at least anytime soon. I'd rather wait 30 minutes and pay more at the Crepe Bar in Tempe than to have lackluster service and a standard crepe.",

I sort of bashed the turkey crepes in an earlier review but have since tried it. In fact, I've tried everything that had pesto in it. Their pesto is so good.   My top favorite is the Chicken Veggie. After that it is tied between the Turkey Pesto and Chicken Supreme. And seriously, all hail that Sunshine crepe, the parfait disguised crepe.",

I got the BLTA (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado), he got a Pizza-Esque crepe, and we shared a strawberry Nutella for dessert.    Everything was FANTASTIC!  The ingredients were fresh and so so flavorful.  The waitress whom I think is the owner, was super sweet and always very attentive.    Since this first positive experience, we've been back several times, and have gotten the same quality food & service.  We will be patrons for years to come.  Keep up the good work!",

The wait staff is quite nice but sometimes it is very busy and they forget to bring the water or take a while. I have often come at different times just to make sure it wasn't due to the crowding but the service is still subpar. I suppose they want to imitate the slow pace of paris.  Each crepe is crafted with care as all of them look fabulous and the taste is just splendid. The crepe itself is not a crispy texture like some places but a stretchy doughy consistency that I am quite fond of. The savory crepes are similar to each other except for the turkey pesto and italian. Turkey pesto is unforgivingly salty but the others seem True to their description. The sweet crepes are a delight and they have a good variety whether you are craving a lighter fruit crepe or chocolate drenched or a mix there is one for you. I enjoy the strawberry, kiwi and honey as well as the sunshine. One crepe rarely fills me though so the bill ends up being expensive since I get one of each. Coffee and italian soda here are also quite good but I wouldn't say it is to die for. All in all it is a wonderful place to sit and relax for a bit as well as enjoy a delicious warm doughy crepe.",

Why I gave this place 4 stars: we ordered within 10 minutes of arriving and didn't receive our food until about 45 minutes into our visit here. The server also forgot to bring us waters and we had to ask again, not a huge deal but still. With these notes: there were only, three servers working. Unsure of cook staffing.  Also, we ordered a side of bacon and received bacon that looked as if it was precooked bacon that you would buy, it was very thin and not very good.",

I had the BLT crepe (everything else seemed like a bit boring) and it was well made but nothing \"craveable\" or really memorable. ..i sort of wish they had a more adventurous savory crepe menu. ..buuut, they don't. Oh well. .maybe I'll stick to the sweet crepes next time. I'm not expecting Crepe Bar level adventurous, just something different instead of typical sandwich ingredients inside a crepe... like maybe one of Goat cheese topped with walnut halves and prosciutto... that's different, right? Cuz most of these combos i could just get at a paradise bakery-like chain place. Their crepe batter itself is good, a good foundation, that is.   The iced Toddy was very very enjoyable and i chugged that baby down quickly. .. What they make, they make well; their service was great and i enjoyed my house drink..so this is a 3.75 star place :)",

I have wanted a crepe forever!! So off we went!  We were a party of 8, and we had separate checks too, but never did our waitress get flustered with us, I have to say service was good and friendly, our drinks were filled, and we were taking care of, instead of bringing us separate checks we were told we would be rung up at the counter, that was easy for us!  I couldn't make up my mind on if I wanted a savory or sweet crepe, so I went for both haha. I 1st ordered the Shirley, which is cream cheese, nutella (LOVE THAT STUFF), strawberries inside and topped with whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce OMG that was pure heaven! Everything was great and perfect, I wanted more!! I think I could eat that every day for a month and never get tired of it, just so delish! Then I ordered the Turkey Pesto, which was pesto, turkey, cheese, avocado and tomato and yes this was a good savory crepe, but I ruined it by having the Shirley 1st, because at this point all I wanted was another Shirley haha.  The turkey pesto though is a good tasting crepe!    I noticed on the board on the way out that they have one that has chocolate, banana and coconut crepe; I know I am coming back for that, plus I already hear the Shirley calling my name!  See ya soon Cups N Crepes!",

One of the owners came by to talk to us while we were there and he was very nice and happy to be there.   It did take a little while to get our crepes but it was well worth the wait.

    "text": "I wondered why I hadn't heard about this place since I used to live within walking distance and a friend works next door. I gave this rating two stars, as I usually award-2 for service, 2 for food, and the 5th star for overall experience and desire to return.   I walked in late Monday morning (not busiest time) and said hello to the lady at the counter and toddler next to her. I always smile but did not get any eye contact when I explained I had never been in before and was excited to try it. I asked how it works...where to order etc. I wanted to enjoy the rainy weather with a new book and eat in. But she mumbled something and went to make coffee, the little girl played with the register and money. (Cricket, cricket) Then I asked the toddler if her name was Bonnie and she said naa, so much for my icebreaker. About 5 minutes pass and the server (Gina displayed on receipt) came back to take my order and at that time I decided to get it to go. I ordered the nutella/banana/strawberry crepe and a mocha, which she said would be \"up in like 2 minutes\". Wow that is FAST, how impressive and I wasn't in any hurry. I awkwardly shifted around the entrance and back wall trying to find a place to stand as the next 25 minutes rolled by. When I stood in back she told me my coffee was up front...which scolded my tongue ouch! I said it is so hot I burned my tongue and would like a couple ice cubes. Yet again no eye contact or comment and she poured in 2 ice cubes. Let me just say I love my coffee but damn that hurt! I also understand fresh quality food isn't instantaneous but would have appreciated a realistic estimate. After trying the crepe I realized it's not my favorite food as I don't like warm bananas and strawberries-no stars taken off that is just my personal taste.   My philosophy is I'm spending money at a local business, welcome me and give me the run down. I did not feel welcome at all. It's not difficult to glance up with a smile and acknowledge a NEW customer to make a good first impression. This is an adorably quaint restaurant and although small it would have been a great place for small meetings. I watched 2 couples come in while I waited and they were not greeted warmly either. Considering these service related factors I'll continue to go to #WHEREUBEAN for coffee and pastries.",

I was excited to try another non-chain resturant, and really wanted to like this place!   We walked in, and noticed the sign to seat yourselves. We were looking around the room for a table when, without even so much as a \"Hi\" or, \"How are you\", the waitress gruffly tells us her only table is outside. Okay, sorry. So we grabbed our menus and silverware and headed outside.   Approximately 10 minutes later we order water and coffee, boyfriend gets a ham and cheese crepe, I order a cream cheese and strawberry crepe. After quite a long wait the food comes out, and my crepe has no cream cheese, just plain strawberries and whipped cream. When I ask the waitress about it (nicely!)- thinking maybe they'd just made a mistake, she quite rudely says \"You didn't order a cream cheese crepe\" then invents a ficticious conversation where she had asked me if I wanted \"just whipped cream and strawberries\", and I said yes...  Despite the fact that that conversation never happened (she hardly said two words to us when we ordered!), my boyfriend AND the people at the table next to us heard me order the cream cheese and strawberry crepe. Plus, I don't even think there's an option on the menu for just a whipped cream and strawberry crepe...  There were no offers to correct the mistake, no apology, nothing. Just an accusation that I didn't know what I ordered, and what did I want her to do about it... Also not a single offer of a refill of water or coffee throughout the meal. Not wanting to sit there for another 20 minutes to wait for our check, boyfriend went inside to pay. Again, that took about 10 minutes because despite having three people behind the counter, not a single person acknowledged him.   WOW! I will admit the food was pretty good (although I really was craving the strawberries and cream cheese...). But we will not be back- because of the service!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place SO bad! I love coffee and I love crepes! It was not meant to be though (...yet). I think if they made a couple changes, they'd be alright. And, I will try them again after a while to see if they've improved. But for now, I'll stay away.  Change 1- The crepes themselves are chewy. Crepes are not supposed to be chewy...at least not that chewy. I've never NEEDED a knife with a crepe before. I've used a knife with a crepe before, but it was absolutely essential here. I'm not a chef, but my guess is too much stirring of the batter creates too much gluten, which means way too chewy crepes (?). I know that's True with pancake batter at least.  Change 2- Without advertising the fact, they used some sort of non-fat or skim milk in their espresso drinks (I ordered an Iced Mocha). I think a little bit of fat (like whole milk) works best in espresso drinks. I would have at least liked the option, but it was not stated anywhere, nor were we asked about type of milk we wanted. Worse yet, they used a cheap brand of milk (or it was expiring?). Bad.  Good points: The fillings of the crepes were actually delicious (otherwise I wouldn't even consider coming back). The turkey, the pesto, the avocado, all delicious! My sis ordered a sweet crepe, and that was also delicious...well, the inside of it anyway. The atmosphere was also nice. I wasn't expecting it to be so 'chic' inside (like I really know what chic is). But, it was both modern & relaxing inside. The service was mostly friendly too...after a rough start.**  Bad Points: Chewy crepes. Low quality milk. **The beginning of our service was weird. I hate when people who work places treat you like you should know how THEY do things even when it's your first time there. You ever pick up on that vibe some place? I didn't even know if you order first or sit first, and they were staring at us like, \"What's your problem?\" Uhh...I don't know what to do; that's my problem! How about welcoming me to your establishment and telling me to have a seat or place my order. They turned into sweethearts after we were seated, but it was a startling introduction.  Bottom line: I will try them again eventually perhaps, but I'm in no rush at this point.",

We frequently use the Enterprise Rent-a-Car located a few doors down, and had noticed the cute signage for the new shop. Instead of hitting a Starbucks or Einstein's, we decided to take a peek at this new place.  What a treat! I enjoyed a sweet crepe filled with Nutella and bananas and topped with fresh whipped cream. It was delicious! My co-worker had the Nutella, bananas and strawberries - also fabulous.   In addition, we had drinks. I had a white mocha and my co-worker had a chai tea.   Besides sweet crepes, they also offer savory crepes, salads and bagels.   The entire place was comfy and cozy with great seating and free Wi-Fi.",

I normally order a savory crepe with egg, cheese, bacon, avocado and mushroom, but I have also experimented and done my own variations. The one time I came here for lunch, I tried the turkey pesto and it was good, but I'd opt for breakfast over lunch any day. The sweet crepes are really good as well; the Shirley is rich and decadent. Anything with Nutella wins in my book. The ingredients always seem fresh and proportionate.  The service can be slow, but the quality of food is worth the wait especially given that it's a non-chain restaurant.  And the people who work there have always been friendly even when it seemed they were overwhelmed. I definitely recommend coming here if you love crepes and a relaxed atmosphere.",

    "text": "My standard for crepes is from my favorite food truck, Truckin' Good Food.  I like this little joint, but it doesn't quite live up to my standard.  My dining companion, a junior crepe aficionado, ordered the turkey pesto crepe, which is supposed to have avocados and tomatoes, etc. Junior crepe aficionado complained that she hadn't bitten into an avocado yet halfway through her crepe, so she opened the darn thing only to find two measly pieces of avocado.   I had the BLT, which was pretty good, but again, missed the mark on the promised avocado.  Maybe avocados were not in season?  Most of the customers were enjoying items from the sweet crepes selection. My dining companions and I did, too. We shared the Nutella, strawberries and bananas topped with whipped cream...and really, how can you go wrong with that? It was delish.  I dig this place, and I was so glad to see the place packed with locals enjoying sweet and savory crepes, while working on their computers (they have free wi-fi BTW). The owners are friendly and they seem to know most of the people present, indicating that they have regulars. That's a good thing.  But there is a difference between my fave Truckin' Good Food's crepes and Cupz and Crepes'. There is a difference in the quality and richness of the ingredients used by both. You bite into a Truckin's crepe and the robustness of the flavors envelops you, leaving you sometimes speechless. You bite into Cupz and Crepes' offering and you say, \"It's good.\" You feel me?  Would I recommend this joint. Yes, of course. It's a good breakfast place where you might just meet your neighbors. It's cozy, it's friendly...and you know... \"it's good.\"",

This may be an unfair advantage but I'd like to think, I've come across the best or at least above average places that I'd like to see duplicated out here.   I recently visited this cafe for lunch. The menu online was not as diverse as I'd hope. But the fact that a crepes cafe exists in the East Valley was enough for me to trek out to Ahwatukee for the afternoon. I didn't know what to expect from Ahwatukee since I never go out in that direction. It didn't have the same flavor of La Creperie in Long Beach but that is downtown Long Beach and it's where diversity lives and breathes. Tucked away in a strip mall, this little cafe stood out among the other stores/restaurants with it's signage and decor. It was a friendly cafe that seemed inviting for a casual meal and laid back ambiance.   I ordered the veggie delight and I tried with all my might to really like it. There was nothing special about it. It was dry from the spinach to the tomato down to the cheese. Absolutely dry. No sauce or flavor. My friend also ordered off the \"savory lunch menu\" and felt her meal was bland as well. We wanted to like it but it just wasn't what we had in mind.   I gave the cafe 3 stars because the owner was very patient with us as we took our time ordering. The chai was good not stellar but good. And overall the experience was fine. I just hope that they put the \"savory\" aspect back in the meals by adding a little sauce or flavor to the dishes. This place has great potential and it would be ashamed to see the only local crepes place disappear like most businesses in the East Valley.",

My usuals are either the Nutella Crepe-YUM or the savory Chicken Supreme-Soo Freaking Good! If you're looking for a chill atmosphere to enjoy some amazing crepes, then Cupz N' Crepes is the place for you!",

I've never really had an especially noteworthy experience here - friendly service, though not always the fastest. Nothing outstandingly amazing, yet also nothing bad. The crepes really are tasty, but they're also don't differ very much from other places that serve crepes. They've got all the basic options - sugar, fruit, and Nutella, as well as savory options like chicken, spinach, cheese, mushrooms, and other meats and veggies. It's always a tough decision of whether to get sweet or savory since both kinds are really good! Though not a super original concept, I do think Cupz N Crepes is worth a try if you're in the area/craving crepes!",

There are only three things you need to know about this place: 1. They've got a lot of crepes. A crepe is like soft tortilla without a lot of flavor. You put stuff in it, and eat it, and the crepe works with basically anything because it's not a strong taste. So we had a chicken crepe, a BLT crepe, and a PBJ crepe. All were great, and all very different experiences.  2. This place is pretty cool in terms of being friendly and family friendly. The waitresses were cool, and did a lot to help keep my tiny, tiny son entertained.  3. It's not super fast, but it's not super slow either. And it's popular. We showed up, there were no open tables, and there were people waiting in like for coffee or something like that. It only took us about 5 minutes to get seated, but I could easily see it taking longer on a weekend, so just plan ahead.",

I don't usually go on weekends which is probably when other reviewers are experiencing longer wait times,  but anywhere you go that is good,  will have wait times.  And the fact that this is a family owned business,  with amazing food makes the wait very well worth it in my book.    I always order the same thing... Cheddar cheese,  bacon,  spinach,  avocado,  and tomato... And every time the food is consistent and delicious!  I love the way I experience all of the flavors throughout the whole crepe (and yes...  I eat every bite).   The owner is very nice and remembers her customers names  (and there are many regulars).  They offer free WiFi and are so generous in allowing people to come in and work and even plug in as needed.

Most of the times that we've come, we've had to wait at least 10-15 minutes just to get menus and water. Then another 10 mins for coffee... and another 20 mins for crepes.   Today was more of the same. However, after waiting the standard 10 mins for our lattes, the waitress brought the wrong drink because she could read what she had written. One we ordered our crepes, we waited another 35 mins. At that point, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else... forgetting that she hadn't yet brought us our food. When we reminded her, she apologized and, to her credit, brought us a fruit bowl. The crepes came out 5 mins later.  After we ate, she brought us the check for full price. I asked her if we can get anything taken off because of the messed up coffee order and the long wait. She said that was why she gave us the free fruit bowl... but she would do something for us. Then, she came back with the revised bill, taking off one crepe ($5). Instead of arguing, I resigned myself to paying it and posting this review.  Again, I wish this were a one-time thing, but you need to know what you expect when you come here - decent food and terrible service. I also wish that there was a better place to get crepes in the east valley. I guess next time we'll try that place in Tempe.",

Shoo I wiped it clean thinking that it would be helpful. It took another 10 min for another waitress too come over & give us menus. No greeting or anything. I handed her the wet rag & said I hope it was alright I just already wiped the table down. She took it & SAID NOTHING!  WE WAITED ANOTHER 20 MIN. & we finally waved her down to ask her if she could take our order. She did & then made a remark about is having patience. This was after waiting over a 1/2 hr. Them others that came in after us were being served. It took another 1/2 hr to serve our crepes. When I got mine it was the wrong crepe & I explained to her I didn't order tomatoes in my crepe it was avocado. She mumbled under her breath she was sure it was tomatoes. We had 5 mins to eat before we had to leave for a meeting at work. All of that to say I will not be going back again. The wait staff has become ruder with each visit.",

The turtle latte I read about was a little subpar compared to the raving reviews ive seen on here about it. The server really nice, but a little slow. Also couldn't break a $20 for me, but understandable. The atmosphere was the best part which is why I bumped up from a 3 star. Unique tables and chairs, newspapers available and positive vibes. Will be back to try some of the sweet crepes.",

However, that being said, the service is horrible! Every time we've been here, it's been bad and getting worse. The owner is downright rude. No smile, no sense of urgency, no \"compassion\". Today there was a party of 22 that came in after us. Overwhelming and noisy? Sure, but not a huge deal. The owner and waitress were asking other guests that were coming in if they had patience to stay because there's a 22 crepe order ahead of them and said that they have a table right there (by the door) where they could sit to be as far from the party as possible. RUDE! You don't say this!!!   Don't go here if you don't have extra time. Food and service takes a long long time! After they finally take your order, they won't come back again. That, coupled with the rudeness makes me not want to go back but again....the food is delicious. That's the only thing saving this place!",

The crepes took about another 40 minutes to come out, but mine was very delicious and I was full after I ate just half of it. Our server never came to check on us and it seemed like she was avoiding us by the time we wanted our check. Probably wouldn't come back to this place, the good crepe isn't really worth the bad service.",

The Coconut, Banana, Chocolate crepe was 1/10, which was a total disappointment. We found two separate hairs in our food. The chef was not wearing a hair net, as he can be seen from the tables. I also suggest that this joint stop using cheap tasting chocolate syrup for the chocolate in their sweet crepes. At least melt some chocolate chips, come on. Definitely choosing Crepe Bar over this place any day, all day. Thumbs double down.",

She also got a root beer Italian soda. I took a sip, oh so delicious! This is Mother's day and we arrived around 1:00 pm. We waited, but not long. All I have to say about this dining experience is yum, yum, yum!  You must go here and experience the cuisine for yourself! There is seating outside and inside.

The waiters didn't greet me and let you stand there (in front of her) and she continues on with her job.  She is not friendly and seem to pick and choose who she wants to take care of or not. When I finally sat down at the table, I had to wait about another 15 minutes before anyone works there realized that I haven't been given a menu. Total Ridiculous. Once I placed my order, I waited another 15 minutes before my food arrived.  Total time spent there was 1 hour between waiting to be seated, waited for services and waited for food. Horrible customer service and food was okay.",

Despite this and only having one hour before an airport run, we could not resist. When we walked in I mentioned we had an hour and asked if we would be OK. The owner said if we were quick to order we'd be fine!  Quick to order....was a tough ask with so many incredible savory and sweet options, not to mention the BYO! We rose to the challenge and built our own savory (they charged it according to the least expensive ingredients????) and ordered the banana, cream cheese, caramel sweet.  While we were battling the menu options the owner made sure to let her staff know we were pushed for time and they were on it.  The crepes were perfect - chewy and moist and slightly crisp on the edges. Very generous fillings and the pumpkin spice latte was 'the best' DH  I wish we had longer than an hour but as we were leaving within our 60 minute window a line was growing at the door.  Friendly staff, lovely decor, hard working owners, welcoming regulars, great attention to detail and an all around gem of a place.  We will be back for sure!",

I ran out to my car to grab my book (dining solo) and when I came back in She was at the register. She asked if it was for here or to go, I said for here. She said 'let me go ask' and walked away. Couldn't help but think that's an odd way to welcome a guest. I saw her powwow with another woman in the back. There was an open table right in front of them. When she came back she said I could take a seat in the waiting  larea. No explanation, just offered me a seat. I was confused and asked 'Am I not able to order now?' And she responded 'oh, yes, sure you can' in a very tentative way. So I asked 'am I not able to sit at the open table back there because It's just me?' And she said yes, we have to 'save' that for a larger party.  Clearly a single guest does not have the value as a group of four guests, but this is the first time I've had a restaurant refuse to give me an open table in the hopes a larger party might come in.",

PS It's National Coffee and only 4 people are in here. She finally comes back and asks me what I want. I tell her a cup of regular coffee and a crepe. She brings it out.  Crepe is tough and lacks flavor hugely. Coffee is barely warm. Since I'm on a tight schedule I don't have time to complain or wait for it to be right.  I did want it to be good!

They make no effort to build rapport or create a welcoming atmosphere. They just want to seat you, take your order, and get you out. They don't introduce themselves at the table; the first and only question they ask is if you're ready to order, after they let you sit for 10-15 minutes. In the handful of times I've been here, not once have they come to check on our table mid meal to see if we need anything else. This morning I asked for waters and lattes and the server brought the lattes and forgot the waters, so naturally I asked again, and she made it seem like I was in the wrong for asking again. It's unfortunate they haven't figured customer service out yet. Their business would increase ten fold if they changed their attitude because the crepes are delicious.",

The service was fine and the crepe itself was actually quite nice but the options for filling were incredibly lame. I got \"turkey pesto\" which was literally deli counter turkey shoved into a crepe with what tasted like Bertolli pesto. They also seem to put romaine lettuce and tomatoes in most of their crepes which for me just ruins the texture and warmth of the dish. I would save $10 and make yourself a turkey sandwich at home.",

    "text": "I was actually very disappointed today. It was my first time showing up so I guess I did have some high hopes. The employees were honestly what really ruined my experience. I wasn't even really seated. Some dude just pointed to a group of tables and it was up to me to pick the right one. I had to wait ten minutes for someone to approach me at my table and give my order and the wait to get the food was long, but I've definitely have had worse so I'm not knocking them for that at all.  I got the crepe with nutella and strawberries and boy the crepe itself was excellent. I feel that the nutella and strawberries were a little too much, but that's not really their fault. They 100% know how to make crepes and that's wonderful.  Really though, I've had bad days at work too, so I can excuse a server for not feeling that well or up for it. The thing is all three different employees that I interacted with made me feel like such a waste of space that I sort of guilt tripped myself into eating as quickly as possible and getting up to pay.  I didn't want to leave a one star review because I don't believe that it's constructive or helpful and it just makes me sound salty. If this kind of behavior is normal for this place, then that's cool too. It's just not for me. I don't know where else I can share about how downtrodden I felt after leaving this spot this morning. I don't want this restaurant to burn or do poorly. I love Ahwatukee and I want the local businesses thrive. I just want to leave a rather helpful reminder that I personally think it's super important for a morning establishment to really do your best and be as nice as you can. A friendly demeanor can really cover up some small mistakes and can only help I think.  Thanks for your time.",

Thankfully I didn't swallow it as I discovered this was a very sharp piece of ceramic!  I showed our waiter (who I believe is also one of the owners) and she took the piece of ceramic, grabbed the plate with the other half of my crepe and just walked off with no apology.  When she finally came back she explained that a piece of the ceramic spoon used to stir the cream cheese broke off into the mix.  Again no apology and she walked away.  She returned a few minutes later with our bill and stated she took the one crepe off and walked away.  Again no apology.  When I looked at the bill she had removed the crepe but also added another charge for something we didn't even order so we had to ask her to adjust the bill.  In summary, food is great but customer service not so much.  I would have appreciated an apology and an offer to bring me a new breakfast.",

The crepe was okay, not impressive by any means, I expected it to be warm and it was pretty cold. Then they made a point of letting me know that they had a wait list (even though there was clearly another person studying that was a regular) and brought me my check.  Never asked if I would have liked anything else, I was considering buying an americano (only because the coffee was so weak.)

I ordered the Nutella & Banana crepe - only $4.50, complete w some chocolate sauce and just enough whipped cream. Mmmmm.   I totally forgot that they may have WiFi here - doh! And they do... apparently good WiFi, so I'm bummed I forgot my iPad. But it was alright, they had plenty of magazines, newspapers, and books to browse through. I chose a People magazine to get my \"Royal Wedding\" fix.   But the crepe was served faster than I could read/skim through the magazine.... (good thing!)  Service was friendly, efficient.   Ambiance was cozy. They have some table & chairs outside, and plenty inside. They even have a couple sofas in the back w/ a TV -- a couple kids were hanging back their while I'm pretty sure their \"Realtor Mom\" was hanging w/ a few other realtors.   Others have noted that the crepe itself was thick - - i didn't seem to really notice if it was thick, if anything mine was probably on the thin side - just right.   They do have plenty of crepes on the menu: breakfast, savory, and sweet. So plenty to choose from.   This would be a great place to meet up w/ a colleague for coffee time. (and crepes)",

The recent decoration change has added a nice theme and fresh look, the red color is more lively than what it was before.  I have tried every item except the salads, guess I just like the crepes so much more than rabbit food.  The food is just enough filling that you are neither stuffed or hungry, and the quality has always been great.  I never have heard any once complain or send anything back.    Usually the noise level is not too loud, but it could be if it was very crowded.  Many times I see people there with laptops.

Charming decor as my friend had told me,  sadly that is where the joy ended.  I waited literally 15 minutes in this very small cafe like setting to be greeted.  Watched the server come and go around me and not once did she say \"I'll be right with you\"  or anything to acknowledge my existence.  Which certainly I appreciate when I see a server struggling,  \"in the weeds' or dealing with another party per say. Another table that sat 5 minutes after me was greeted first, received their drinks, and then I was greeted with no mention as to any delay.  I ordered an avocado, tomato crepe w no cheese.  It was fine, rather bland and I ordered salsa to help it achieve some much needed flavor.  The waitress never mentioned that I pay at the front register so I waited quite a long time with my credit card on the table waiting to have it ran, as that is the typical process for most sit down cafes/restaurants. Finally when I figured it out I went to the front and asked for a to go cup for my tea from the server,  I then  proceeded to wait as the server went to take other orders while I stood at the register waiting for a to go cup...  Overall it wasn't terrible,  but other than the fact that it's decor is adorable and it offers a vast selection of crepes,  I would not make an effort to return due to the poor service and less than phenomenal crepes.",

    "text": "Based on food by itself, I would have only given a two.  I don't think crepes (and I am by no means an expert crepe eater) should be tough. I don't think they should need to be sawed through with a serrated knife. Each of the three times I visited for breakfast this was the case. The fillings might have been savory and delicious, but the wrapper should have had BF Goodrich stamped on it.  So it gets a three for three reasons:  The coffee is great. The atmosphere is open, airy and comfortable. The wifi is strong  Oh, and they have daily newspapers there as well. As much as I am wedded to my electronics, I love to look at newsprint in the morning with my cup of coffee.  So my A-OK is for the coffee and the atmosphere. Try something other than crepes if you're hungry.",

I will give it another try (and stay away from the Pesto next time) and see if maybe it's an actual hidden gem or it's just over rated mistake.",

The savory crepes were dry, and slightly bland, also lacking in creativity. I was wishing for some seasoning, non-lunchmeat ham, and some green chile sauce to bring some flavor. The Nutella crepe was by far the best, although the use of ready whip and Hershey's syrup took away from the Nutella, wish they had made their own products. The cinnamon sugar crepe was by far the worst, having almost no flavor.  If they had used less store product I think they would have a dynamite crepe, it's not hard at all to make whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  Overall a mixed experience, prefer Crepe Bar for their far superior, and much more creative crepes.",

The service has always been friendly. It can get crowded on the weekends but it's a small place so it comes with the territory.   I absolutely love The Shirley crepe. Its a crepe filled with cream cheese, Nutella, Strawberries, chocolate sauce and then topped with more chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The strawberries are always fresh and taste amazing. There is a perfect blend of Nutella and Cream Cheese. I have never been a big Nutella fan but something about mixing it with cream cheese makes is heavenly.   I have made my own crepe in which I will usually get chicken, bacon, pesto, lettuce, and cheese. Very good but the sweet crepes have always been more my style.   I've had their blended coffees and iced coffees which really don't taste that much different from any coffee chain place I've been. They do offer Italian sodas which I love (get a raspberry one with whipped creams) it's extremely good.   In all, I really enjoy this place. I would like to come more often on the weekend to be able to work on my side business blogging and running social media. I have never had poor service. Just remember that this a small family run place. They don't have multiple cooks turning out dishes left and right. If it's crowded it may take some time. Just sit back and relax because it is definitely worth it.",

The lady that waited on us was super nice and friendly (short brown hair and glasses). Really cute decor, would be a great spot to just go and have coffee as well. Also amazing prices, less than $7 per crepe and we did not leave hungry.   Went back again a few days later for breakfast. They were really slow (the waitress warned us and we were in no hurry so we didn't mind, but just FYI if you are trying to get in and out quickly on a Sunday). Again, had the same waitress from the couple days before who was super nice. She wasn't great about drink refills or checking after we got our food, but she seemed to be waiting on every single table in the place, bussing the tables and making  drinks so I don't blame her - seems just like they need to hire a few more people. She seems to be the one keeping this place moving so kudos to her! There was another with waitress with tattoos (nothing against them, just what I remembered) who was rude to almost everyone who walked in, even when they were friendly with her. She seemed to do about 25% of the work (not sure if any table was actually solely hers), while ours did the other 75%. The breakfast crepes we had were really blan with not a lot of flavor - crepe itself was just as good as the first time, but the filling lacked anything exciting. We had the ham, egg and cheese (had to put salt, pepper and hot sauce on it before I even wanted to finish eating it), my mom had the tomato, spinach, egg and cheese (spinach was not sauteed and was cold). Again both really blan.   Great place to go with girlfriends.   In conclusion, I probably won't return for breakfast, but will return frequently for lunch!",

The \"patio\" is just a sidewalk facing a parking lot but when it's nice outside, who cares? Our server was friendly, efficient and non-intrusive (thankfully, as we were definitely NOT in a rush). My latte was prepared exactly as I asked (special instructions that Starbucks often gets wrong somehow) and the servings are just the right size. I can personally recommend the Banana Nutella (just like the ones at Cibo!), the Strawberry Cream Cheese, and the Turkey Pesto. My friend loved her Strawberry, Kiwi with Honey.

Kudos to the waitresses hustling with everyone's order. Strawberry and whip cream crepes. Not too much and not too little portion, it was great!",

There is no problem with requests like this We recently took our 9 year old granddaughter here for lunch.

And there seems to be a little east coast surliness some mornings, which I like.  But to me it is just what Ahwatukee needs, a place to have a coffee/chai, have a conversation with friends or family, read a magazine or fiddle with your iPad, and get a good crepe.   But if the pace or service bugs you, there is a Cracker Barrel just down the street.    The crepes are yummy. Not like ones you get in London or Paris, or even Seattle for that matter. But for suburban Phoenix they are great. My guess is it is the ingredients. Not as fresh maybe?    The selection of crepes is good, and they have always accommodated any requests or custom orders.  I've had most of the \"cupz\" offerings as well and they are all good, hot or cold. My kids like the Italian sodas.   I wish they had a bigger patio with a better view than the parking lot, but it is a strip mall and they do well with what they have. The decor is cute \"Paris\" without being over the top and they have books and coloring for the kids. They also have a couch area with a TV for any catching critical sporting events that might be on.   The business level is unpredictable. Light during the week it can be packed on weekend mornings, but is sometimes empty.   I recommend the eggs, ham and cheese for breakfast or the nutella and bananas for sweet crepes.   I kind of wish they were open late. It would be great for coffee and desert crepes.",

As we went in we were seated and it was very slow and we felt like we were a bother that we were there. I ordered a crepe with strawberries and my husband got a bagel with eggs and bacon. First off my crepe tasted like a soggy tortilla, I was quite depressed because knowing what an actual crepe tastes like getting this instead was seriously sad. Not only that but my husbands bacon was MICROWAVED..what the hell? Sad to say your stores name shouldn't have \"crepes\" in it if you can't make them. So, unfortunately the best part of this place was the hot chocolate...",

It is surprising how common this is throughout the valley.  Coffee snobs who know what coffee should be like, might prefer Seattle Espresso down the street.  As far as ambiance, Cupz n Crepes wins.  Usually the Eiffel Tower motif seems too trite, but I didn't mind it so much here.  The spread here offered warmth of a woman's touch too.  Although it was far from old-timey, it seemed like a smiling grandmother might come out of the kitchen door with an apron and the smell of fresh apple pie.",

Great little breakfast/lunch spot with outstanding coffee drinks (the cappuccino is perfect) and many varieties of homemade crepes.  Good vibe and one of a kind in Ahwatukee.  The only reason I am not giving a five star review is two things:  no music playing in the background for some odd reason; personal huge pet peeve of mine and worse, the two ladies that own/manage this establishment do not come off as the friendliest people in the world.  Maybe it was a bad morning for both of them but I've never understood running a small business (or any business) and not being friendly and personable to its customers but fortunately the other attributes makes up for this short coming.",

Yelp'ed a few options and decided on this one- crepe's sounded yummy.  It was busy on a mid-Sunday morning, yet just two parties ahead of us waiting for tables. It was hot outside (PHOENIX ;p, its a given) but definitely \"cooler\" than the past few days. Hungry = getting cold drinks and deciding to sit outside.   It actually was comfortable, and we were able to order & get our food quickly. Simple menu, great options. My friend went wit the featured special, I built my own savory crepe. Devoured. We both got nutella crepes for \"dessert\"....not as good as my spot I found in San Diego, though good nonetheless. It was starting to really heat up so the whipped creme melted literally as soon as they were brought to us. Okay with me, since I wasn't gonna eat it anyway but it was funny. Waitress brought us extra glasses of water- she knew we were in the \"warm\" area- great service.  Greatly priced, fast and pleasant service, great size portions. This may be a tradition in the making. ;p",

For your crepe, I prefer The Graceland. It's a combination of peanut butter, bananas, and honey mixed into perfection. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also add bacon, even though it's not on the menu. It's becoming more popular because those who have been here are sharing how amazing it is.",

Very affordable!  The facility is very small, and you may have to wait a few minutes prior to being seated.  The service is a little slow and takes a bit to warm up to the staff because initially because they did not come off too friendly.  My 3 kids and I ordered 3 dessert crepes. We ordered Nutella w/whip, banana Nutella and a savory cheese, egg and avocado crepe! Delish!!   My son does not like crepes because he is very particular with what he eats however this crepe hit the right spot because he guzzled it down like water.  The portion size is enough to fill you up! The crepes were soft, fresh and just right! The fillings were made with fresh vegetables and fruits without the gooey preserves that normally comes with any fruit crepe.  We would definitely come back! We spent a whopping $17 for 4 orders of crepes and an iced vanilla latte!",

The crepes themselves are crispier than you usually find, but personally I prefer it to the soft ones.  What others have said about the service is True.  Sometimes it gets slow when the place is packed, and sometimes you get forgotten once your food has been served.  It may be time to hire some additional staff.  However, the owner recognizes the regulars and builds good rapport with them, a serious plus in my mind.  As far as the coffee goes, it's the best place in Ahwatukee if you're a chain-hater like me.  It's priced typically (i.e., too expensive, but about the same as any Starbucks in Arizona) and they have tons of latte options.  I'm definitely a fan.  Recommended:  BLTA, Nutella and bananas, Iced salted caramel latte.",

My friend got a sweet one with fruit and Nutella. I tried a bite it was really amazing !!! The coffee is so good the cappuccino I got was perfect !!! ( Coffee snob here lol). My friend got a chocolate banana iced coffee all I can saw is wow. I can't believe this is my first visit !!! I can guarantee it won't be my   Update as of 6/16/18  since my original review we have been in two times. The first visit the girl working was not friendly but I brushed it off. The next the visits they staff was even ruder. There was a woman working with short brown hair today so Rude!!!! My husband said good morning she just gave him  a dirty look!! The person behind us also felt the staff is rude. The breakfast sandwich sucked I got today. My husbands crepe was really good. The one thing I can't stand is rude staff.

    "text": "Prologue: This restaurant had been recommended to us awhile back by a family member and my fiancee had subsequently mentioned it a few times. We finally decided to give it a try on one of our recent weekend brunch excursions.   The Plot: We started by sharing a Breakfast Bagel with sausage and cheddar cheese.   That was followed with two entrees, including the Monte Cristo Crepe (turkey, ham, Swiss cheese, topped with powdered sugar and raspberry preserves) and the Turkey Cranberry Crepe (turkey, cranberries, spinach, candied walnuts, and cream cheese).   The Scene: We arrived around 11:00am on a Saturday morning and the restaurant was busy as usual. The service was prompt and courteous and we were seated within about 10 minutes. My fiancee was pleased with the decor, which she felt had a family-owned feel to it.   I'm convinced we made the best choices from the available options for the Breakfast Bagel. The egg was firm but not at all dry, the sausage patty was plump, and the bagel was toasted just right.   The crepes definitely had a made-from-scratch taste and texture flavor.  The meats in both crepes were good quality, sliced thin, warm, tender, and flavorful.  The sweet ingredients also nicely complemented the savory meats. I'm more accustomed to lingonberry jam on crepes, however the raspberry preserves worked just as well.   The Rest of the Story: We shared a large mug of Matcha Green Tea Latte, which was very yummy and highly recommended.   Prologue: This place turned out to be a very nice spot for weekend brunch.

I guess I have noticed they seem preoccupied and busily rushing around.   They don't give people a fake- chirpy \"HI THERE \"!!!  -Which is often a bit .. just a TAD irritating, to look around for the voice and make a fake response back.   I did try one time on check out smile and compliment the cashier on the meal and guess what I got back? A smile and a genuine thank you.  Since I'm really here for the FOOD- I'm not too upset that they're too busy to be social- I've never been treated rudely.   I tried a Pumpkin Pie Latte- after asking the server-lady which she recommends.  It was yummy. I forgot to take a picture until it was nearly gone (:  The Turkey Pesto savory crepe rocks  There was an extra amount of pesto on my crepe-YES!  One day I will get brave and venture out to a new crepe- but I just LOVE this one!  I highly advise trying this little hidden gem.  I will keep coming here for sure- and if I feel the need for a smile or greeting-I'll give one to get one. Works for me",

    "text": "First thing we notice everytime we come is, we're never greeted at the door, which made the very first time we came very awkward because we weren't sure if we seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us, so after about 10mins of standing awkwardly around, we were finally told to pick a table. So this time, being seasoned to the service, we just walked in and found a table. We do notice if you have a baby, they pay A LOT more attention to you and are super friendly, so if someone has a baby we can borrow when we visit and you need a morning to yourself, we'd be glad to help out, haha. Anyway, I ordered the Spiced Chai Latte, my normal go to and it was perfectly sweetened and not at all bitter like some chai's tend to be. Also had a nice smoothe feel to it. My husbands French kiss latte, which is white chocolate, raspberry latte, was pretty good. It had an odd during taste to it but the after taste was good, in my opinion. Husband says in a silly voice,  \"It had a distinct flavor without being overpowering\". Haha. I got the Shirley's Gone Bananas, which is a great and tasty combination of nutella, bananas and strawberries in a crepe, topped with a generous portion of whipped cream. Normally, I'm more of a pancake person but I have to day, these crepes are my exception. They taste fantastic especially with all the stuffing inside, Husband got the Elvis which is CHUNKY peanut butter, banana and honey. He loved it. It didnt stand a chance the moment it arrived at the table. Overall- come for the food not the service because the food and drinks are worth it.",

We decided to come once more, to give the benefit of the doubt that it was just a busy day and once more, we did not get greeted and had to walk up to staff and ask if we need to seat ourselves. We waited to get seated with plenty of available spaces and the wait was again too long- looking around almost no one had food on their tables and decided it wasn't worth the wait or frustration. We were bummed because of the decent reviews but quite frankly, to wait an hour for crepes is not worth it. Please work on your customer service, at least greet us.",

The menu provides a vast selection of sweet and savory crepes. My favorite is the Shirley's Gone Bananas which is always overflowing with fresh bananas and strawberries. They really give you a good amount of food! The coffee is also really good and one of the only places that provides a Pumpkin Spiced latte all year around that is so good! The staff is friendly and gets to know you after you come in a few times. This place is truly a gem in Ahwatukee!",

We read the reviews and a lot of them said that the employees don't smile and they aren't the nicest. We kind of laughed it off and decided to go anyways because people said the food was great. So went and when we got in, we were asked \"how many\" from a lady behind the bar (with no smile or friendly greeting) and she just told us to sit wherever. So we did. We didn't know if we order at the front.. or if they come to...? It was confusing. There was another girl behind the cash register (because it seems this place is also a coffee shop). And it took a couple of confused looks at her to come and bring us the menu (again no smile or anything). Oh by the way, the actual restaurant was cute and clean so no complaints there. We had our orders taken by a waitress (still no smile) and then we waited. Our food came out with not a too long of a wait. It was quite delicious! I got the sunshine. A crepe with strawberry yogurt, berries, whipped cream and granola on top. I really loved it. My boyfriend got a turkey pesto and he seemed to enjoy it as well. So half way eating I ended up finding a LONG piece of hair in my crepe . I told the waitress to take it and she asked me if I wanted them to remake it but I said no because I lost my appetite. They took it off the bill which is expected but nothing really more happened. Usually the manager comes up and talks to us but nope.. nothing. Which is fine I guess but just weird. I think we'd go back... food was still delicious.. I suppose maybe they just had an off day?",

Avocado/Bacon/Mushroom/Mozzarella Crepe: I made a custom one and it was bomb af. Kinda tasted like a BLT fell apart in a crepe...minus the lettuce and tomato...okay so maybe not actually a BLT...but just as good!  Dessert Crepe: bananas, strawberries, nutella, cream cheese, whipped cream, chocolate sauce.....extremely good.   I'm a fan!",

The crepes looked delicious when they brought them out and had very good plate appearance. The downside was that all of our crepes were soggy which made it hard to eat them.  Also, behind the counter seems to be not the cleanest which made me a little sketched out as I was eating.

I went to IHOP to try their crepes and they tasted like plastic well I went to this place and they kinda tasted like plastic as well. They didnt blow me away at all so I guess I have to continue making my own!!! Nice idea though.",

Small portions,  but ok in taste,  nothing spectacular,  what gives this place a two star really the service!  Terrible service,  sat at a table, no server, went up to desk and got our own menus,  and still no waitress, waited about ten minutes for her to come by, and finally placed an order. Iced coffee was bitter and had to wait to get cream,  again the service was an attitude of indifference,  and two word answers.  The whole restaurant had about 5 other people, we were just put off, and certainly won't go back.  At a recent dinner party,  we laughed at our misfortune with our friends,  and found out weren't the only ones being snubbed and treated poorly,  so at least the server is consistent.",

My husband woke up this morning & said he wanted to make Blueberry cream cheese crepes. I told him there was this place i wanted to try that made crepes & we should go there instead, and it is worth it to me to go out so I don't have to clean up a huge mess. So we took our dogs and had a great Sunday breakfast. They have a few patio tables outside & the Arizona weather is perfect right now to eat outside! The staff was great & they kept checking to make sure we had everything we needed which is great b/c sometimes when you are outside it can be easy to be ignored. I ordered a vanilla latte & my husband had a plain coffee. My latte was perfect, just sweet enough for me. My husband saw that they did indeed have blueberry cream cheese crepes & ordered one. I went a little more savory and ordered the turkey, avocado & pesto crepe. They were both fantastic. Pesto can be very oily, but this was perfect and really brought everything together in a perfect bite. The blueberry crepes were great too, but I'm glad i didn't have that to myself as it was very sweet & rich. My husband has a huge sweet tooth though & he is a sucker for blueberries so he was in heaven. The staff even brought a bowl of water out for our dogs. Great little spot to meet up for a cup of coffee & a light breakfast! Will definately be back.",

My last visit it took nearly an hour to get our two crepes and not one refill of coffee.  I have been here a few times and in all instances I would have to agree with the posters previously who have stated that a person could feel more like a burden to wait on than a actual paying customer.  I don't necessarily blame the wait staff, I just think they need more help during the busy times.....and an occasional smile wouldn't hurt either.  I have debated returning each time but somehow the tastiness of the crepes keeps me coming back.  I'll just return on the off peak hours, I guess.",

    "text": "I think I'd like to give them like a 3.5 really. We talked about going there for quite awhile since it's just around the corner from where we live. Finally, last Saturday, after an early jaunt to the dog park, the boy and I decided to have a nice little brunch date. The place was fairly empty and we were surprised to find it was full table service. We were prepared to order at the counter and then sit. The decor was really cute and the atmosphere was really nice. The waitress was a little bit abrasive, and not my favorite, but we ordered lattes and a couple of sweet crepes, read the Ahwatukee Foothills News and just enjoyed some pleasant conversation. We both went with sweet crepes, the Strawberry, Nutella and Whipped Cream. I've never been to France and I've not traveled the world over so I'm not going to tell you about how inferior their crepes are to those I've enjoyed in Paris, so I think they were good. I guess they're a little on the thick side, from what I've heard about crepes, but it created a good balance with how much filling they put in them. This past Saturday we had friends stay over and they wanted to go as well, so we went again for the second Saturday in a row. This week there was apparently some sort of Senior Olympics, so 90% of the tables were pushed together for them, fine whatever. So we were sat and brought menus, and not two seconds after the first waitress walked away, the same woman as the last time came over and said \"are you ready to order?\". I felt kind of rude but she was so I guess no harm, no foul, but I just said \"She literally JUST brought us the menus\". So she went away for 30 seconds and was back. Then we ordered coffee, 1 min later she was back with the coffee and very clearly ready for our order. We were half way through giving our order when this group of 3 other diners who were apparently regulars and favorites of the waitress felt that they should interject and begin joking about the waitress not already knowing their order, she of course obliged, and eventually returned to taking our order. We ordered a breakfast crepe each and then two sweet crepes to share. She informed us that she was just going to bring them all out together because that other large group was going to be ordering too. It was obvious what they were trying to do was squeeze us in really quick before the large group of senior bicyclists weeded their kitchen for 20 mins. That's cool, I get it, but it could have been done a bit more gracefully. I had the Ham, Egg and Pepper Jack cheese crepe, which was really good. The ham seemed to be really good quality. One saving grace of the waitress was that she had the forethought to put the whipped cream on the side of the sweet crepes so that it wasn't a melted mess by the time we were ready to eat them. Everything was tasty yet again, but I still think their service could use some work, or maybe I just need to work on being \"a chosen one\". We'll probably go back once in a while, we'll just try to avoid senior bike race day from now on. (Nothing against senior bicyclists of course)",

Service has never been fabulous but not worth complaining about until it went out-of-bounds bad today. Today, a friend and I sat and waited literally 30 minutes before anyone would even bring us water.  This was after my friend had to get up and ask someone at the counter to please come serve us.  Even after that, there was an uncomfortable time lapse before we even got the water!  Then, when the waitress finally came over for our order, my friend politely informed her how long we had waited to even be acknowledged and we were only rewarded with intense attitude/denial and no apology!  One apology if she hadn't seen us or felt overwhelmed would have gone a long way - I get it, but nothing.  We watched her serve all of the other tables food (most of which had arrived after us) before we even had some water!  It was so bad that I started to wonder if the waitress could possibly have something personally against us that I was completely unaware of but that's crazy, right?? So, no validation, no apology, no comp on the bill, no vindication, (except perhaps this review) just a fear that there was waitress spit in my crepe or water...  Don't waste your time here.",

Everyone who works there looks as though they dont want to be there, they are critically under-staffed for being busy on a Saturday and they make you stand and wait ages before anyone acknowledges you!  We waited so long to be served that i decided that maybe one is supposed to go up to the counter to put in the order.  The untidy girl behind the counter said to me that sg2e would come and take my order but they were \"just busy right now!\"  Couldnt believe what i heard!  Firstly, do you want the business or not?  Secondly,  maybe you should hire more people!!!! You dont tell a paying customer that you are too busy to serve them!  The crepes were forgettable and i had hoped they would make up for the bad service.  They looked nice but were really very underwhelming.  My caramel latte tasted like dish water so i feel like comibg gere for a special occasion was not the best idea.  It made sense though...if your \"too busy\" to give good service then it goes without saying that yr quality control goes out of the window because your \"too busy\"!  Sorry...not impressed !",

Been looking for a neat coffee place instead of the chain coffee place down the street. Tasty creative food, quality cold brewed coffee. Nice comfy looking chairs in back. A must try!",

    "text": "You now how you want something and when you don't get it and try something else, it pales by comparison? Yeah. That's this place for me. My favorite place is closed for remodeling. So we tried it here. Every sweet crepe had a \"base\"-- most of them cream cheese. Why? To keep the fruit from getting warm. Um, ok. But I like it a different way, so I asked for a plain one with fruit on the side ($3.25). Bowl was plentiful and fruit mostly ripe. Crepe was, well, not what I expected. It was almost crispy--not what I'm used to, I guess.  Tasted a little doughy but with enough Carmel sauce l, most things are much better. Coffee was ok, too; cups were large and hot. Good sign.  Overall, this place is fine. Nothing over the moon but, in light of many of my other dining experiences, not awful either. I'd recommend waking in without expectation and enjoy the ride.",

They also have savory crepes when you want a meal and a dessert. It seems like they are pretty busy on the weekends for breakfast and brunch so get there early or you'll have to wait in line. The only downside is the when you start scarfing down the deliciousness, the crepe doesn't always remain so pretty.",

Immediately liked the decor, we were invited to sit anywhere to our liking.   My twin SILs went for savory crepes: Turkey Pesto and the Cordon Bleu which are their 'go tos' while the other shared a Nutella & Strawberry with my niece. All three had coffee beverages which are also their tried-and-True options, my niece had almond milk. I chose the Strawberries & Honey crepe requested no whipped cream, and an almond milk chai latte; both were absolutely delicious, I took half my crepe to go: it was loaded with fresh strawberries! Absolutely loved that the chai came in an oversized (think \"Friends\") cup, not cardboard!   Service was cheerful, knowledgeable, and we did not feel rushed at all, even late in the day nearing closing time. Will absolutely return to try more menu items, 'Shirley Gone Bananas' and the Swedish Crepe are on my radar.   * salads available *  ** sweet and savory crepes, reasonable prices  **  *** gets busy during 'prime time, waits are the norm ***  **** very clean restaurant and restrooms! ****",

We didn't want anything fancy, just fresh, tasty, and hot.  This was just the place.  Lots of strawberries in my son's crepe-so many that he couldn't eat them all.  I had a Monte Cristo crepe and it was exactly what I wanted...sweet and savory.  We also shared a banana and cream cheese crepe with caramel drizzle and whipped cream.  The crepes themselves were also good.  Would definitely eat here again if we are in the area.   It wasn't completely slammed at the time we were there(Saturday late morning)but my guess is it could get that way.  It's a spacious place in spite of being in a strip mall type setting, albeit a nice strip mall.  The area is pleasant enough.",

There are a few things I'd like to see change though:    - A hostess would be welcome.  Being my first time here I walked in and was unsure of what to do.  There's a register and a long counter so there was no clear indicator as to whether it was counter service or table service.  I had to track down an employee to find out.   - The service is spotty.  There were two waitresses working when I was there.  Every table was full so it was 15 minutes before we got to order.   - The wait times for food.  After ordering it was 20-25 minutes for two crepes.  That's way too much.  I didn't mind as I wasn't in a hurry but it made me sure to never come here if you have anywhere to be in the next 90 minutes.    I like crepes and  I like coffee and I like good service.  Two out of three ain't bad.",

    "text": "Downgrading them a star.  The crepes are still tip top.  This time I had the Chicken Supreme and my co-worker ordered a custom crepe with egg and some veggies and they were served hot and fresh as always.  Very good!    BUT... it took *forever* to get them!  In their favor, it was pretty crowded, but it looks like they still have one of the staff on waitress duty, one on hostessing and only one chef after a few years in business.  That formula seemed to work well when they opened because there were only a few people there on any given visit.  Fast forward to 2013 with a full house, me and company hunkered over our smartphones next to the giant spoon and fork.  It took about 5 minutes to get our order in and almost 30 minutes to get our order on the table.  I saw others waiting and fidgeting around us, too.  Forget the days of yore when they'd return mid-meal to ask if we wanted to get another crepe.  They didn't bother this go-round.  We went to the cash register without waiting to see if they delivered the tab to our table.    Rule of thumb:  If they're busy, give yourself ample time to get service or call ahead and take out.  They get a little apprehensive about not giving it to you fresh off the pan if you're not already on site, but they pulled it off the one time I gave to-go a try.  In house, order something substantial.  Getting seconds may not be in the cards.",

I didn't feel welcomed and it certainly didn't make me feel like I should go back anytime soon. I like crepes and I wouldn't say that I seek them out. What makes the difference for me as a customer beyond the good food is great service. I'll come back all the time and be a really loyal customer when the atmosphere is warm. Today I felt more like it was an inconvenience for us to be eating and getting waited on. I was there for 2 hours and wanted to order more food but the server only came to the table twice (to take the order and to deliver the food). I wanted more water and my cup was empty for at least an hour and a half. So I can't say that I'll be going to this place anytime soon for a dine in. If you're big on service I'd say be cautious going here or order to go if you absolutely look crepes because although the food is good the service is not.",

But more likely it was the fact that even though the pepperoni was the pre-sliced, supermarket variety, and the added olives and mushrooms had clearly spent the past year or so in a can, they balanced in perfect harmony with the salty ham, the thick, gooey mozzarella cheese and the perfectly crisp crepe. Not a \"gourmet\" crepe, sure, but a _damn_ tasty one!  I'm from out of town and their free WiFi was a lifesaver, allowing me get some important work done while I'm away at a conference.

I don't really care for small talk but if i want some its there.  Service is great and  making food from scratch takes time.  So I usually bring my lap top and do some work while I wait.  Owners don't know my name because I am not a regular but they do recognize your face and nod acknowledgement.  It's either seat your self if the restaurant is not crowded or the put you at a table, but wait isn't very long.  I go during the week so I usually don't have a wait.  I avoid weekends because 9-5'ers are there and they need some much more attention.  Too much drama. The food is outstanding and creative.  Coffee is great I wish it was a little hotter, but since that old lady at McDonald's they have to be careful.  I highly recommended this place. I am glad they made it through the rough spots in the  economy  I was afraid it be like a lot restaurants in Ahwatukee here today gone tomorrow.",

My wife and I wasted 2+ hours on both occasions because of how poorly this operation is run.  Waitress covered in tattoos from head to toe--thought she was part of a prison work-release program, but I guess she is the owners' daughter?  At least 30 minutes after being seated for her to even show up to the table.  Spent the next 30 minutes attempting to get silverware, water, and coffee--actually went and refilled my own water glass twice to avoid the wait.  An hour after ordering, the food arrives, which made sense when I saw that the henpecked husband/owner was the only one cooking on a jam-packed Sunday morning.  His head was bowed like a dog awaiting a beating from the wife/owner who is a truly nasty, arrogant person.  I could not believe her snarky comments--actually shocked me into silence.  Whenever one of her \"buddies\" arrived, nasty woman rushed right to their table, set it, and catered to their every need, ignoring all other patrons.  So maybe it is her intent to chase away those who are not in the \"inner circle?\"  Prices were a bit on the ridiculous side, all things considered, and I'm not going back in an effort to sycophant my way into the \"inner circle.\"  Lady, I hope your \"pals\" continue to keep your doors open because, if they don't, I seriously doubt you can maintain a viable enterprise--the food wasn't so spectacular that anyone outside the \"circle\" would willingly ignore the crap you displayed.",

We love their brewed coffee - it is outstanding. The service cannot be beat, not only do they arrive at our table with our coffee in hand but they are attentive throughout the meal. The crepes are the best and there are so many to choose from. You can get sweet to savory and they have several already listed in the menu or simply put together the combo that sounds best to you - they'll give you what you want, every time. And that's one of the things I like best about them; you get the same great service the first time you go in as you do the 1,000th time you go in! Not far off the freeway so worth the drive even if you live in Tempe or Chandler but there's no excuse in not going no matter what part of Ahwatukee you live! And the WiFi is free!",

The chocolate sauce, Nutella and Cream Cheese harmoniously suited the fresh Strawberries. I literally ate this crepe up in less than 10 minutes it was so good! I also had a Blended Carmel Latte which was equally good but too sweet to eat with my crepe. Make sure you stick with black coffee if you want to get a sweet crepe. My sister went for a more simpler crepe; the \"sugar and cinnamon\". She also raved about the texture and perfect sweetness. Next time I go back I think I'll try a savory crepe.  The atmosphere is really laid back, fairly quite unless someone orders something blended. The service is a little on the slow side but not so slow to negatively affect the overall experience. So what are you waiting for? Go try a Crepe today!",

    "text": "This is my first review, so here I yelp!  A friend of mine recommended this place for crepes, and I needed a quick stop to eat lunch. It looks like they just opened. First of all, I am a crepe fan, and I honestly think they can do better. I came with that expectation because food at restaurants isn't always satisfactory, and I've stopped going out for a long time.  I ordered a Veggie Delight (I'm a vegetarian/vegan), and it had baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes and feta cheese, and it wasn't fully wrapped and there was too much feta cheese. I like a crepe where everything's stuffed in-nothing spilled out on the ends. I liked their simple selection of ingredients-I would have liked to see more vegetarian options. They do have the \"create your own crepe\" option, but I wasn't in the right mood to invent my own crepe. It costs $3.50 for a crepe with 1 topping and for every meat you add, it's 1.00 and savory & cheese for .75. If I really made the effort to design my own crepe, I would have ordered spinach and swiss, and it would have been slightly cheaper than the Veggie Delight (it cost $5.25) for less ingredients.  If I could come here again, I would try the breakfast crepe and sweet crepe when I need my sweet fix. And maybe that'll change my rating. :)  I like the design and decor of the cafe-a nice mixture homey 'n' modern feel to it-loove the wooden fans. Doesn't ave alot of character, but there are several old-french style decor. The open celings with metal covers are cool. It is very spacious, and there are several black plush chairs and lots of tables and chairs. I would come here to study since they have free WIFI here, and you can find comfort here.  I ordered iced chai with soy milk, and it was surprisedly good-most places don't make it right!  Lastly, the customer service is greeeat-as soon as I sat down, a waitress came up to me and asked what I wanted to order-you would think this cafe is a typical one where you go to the bar and take your order, but this is also a restaurant setting where they serve you.  If not for crepes, I'd def recommend this place for a hang-out and a sip of coffee with friends if you want to steer away from the devli's brew for yuppies.  (Starbucks)",

We walked in and what looked like the manager was standing behind the counter, stared at us for a good few minutes without greeting us or saying anything.  Finally we asked if we should seat ourselves, and coldly she replies, \"Ya.\" So we sat ourselves and waited 5 minutes or more before anyone greeted us or brought us menus.  After asking for menus she comes over and throws menus and utensils on our table.  We wait another 5 minutes for her to come back and take our drink order, at this point we ordered breakfast as well.  She again, was cold and snappy.  We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks, in which were sub par.  After my friend found a bug in her latte, the manager says, \"Yeah, what do you want me to do about it?' From someones who's spent over 5 years working in customer service, I was appalled that this was a business owner's reaction to a problem that was out of the customer's control.  She didn't voluntarily comp the drink until we asked nor did she offer to make a new one. Worst service i've ever experienced from management and I do not recommend this place nor will I ever be back.",

    "text": "This has to be one of my favorite places to eat! They have great tea and coffee and delicious food. I have yet to have a crepe I didn't like here. The place itself is warm and welcoming and has a great atmosphere. I recommend the turkey pesto- its one of my favorite savory, and split dessert, any sweet crepe i have tried here has been a winner, even something as  simple as powdered sugar and lemon juice. Bon appetit!",
