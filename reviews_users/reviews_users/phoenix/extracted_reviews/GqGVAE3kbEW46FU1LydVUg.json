We came in around 7 pm, were seated promptly, and didn't have to wait long until we were asked for our drink orders. Our waitress was amazing. Not only did she recommend menu items to us, but she also gave us a sample of guac to try.   Our meals were excellent. They were more than enough food for 2 meals. The chips and salsa were also wonderful. Our waitress then gave us a sample of dessert to try!  Customer service here was excellent. We will be going back soon! Thank you for a great experience!",

Their salsa is spicy so be forewarned if you have a problem with heat; but I think it's the best salsa in the valley. The rice is also slightly buttery with corn and is addictive.  You should try: - Fajita quesadillas - Beef empanadas - Fajitas - SW chicken tacos (w/onion ring and chipotle crema) - Beef enchiladas with ranchero sauce - Dessert: sizzling apple crisp",

    "text": "How long can a ball roll downhill before it reaches the bottom? On the border has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple of years it just keeps getting worse and worse. I walk through the door with a friend of mine and see an empty host stand. I wait for what felt like five minutes of seeing employees checking in on their tables and looking at me just standing there until finally someone shows up to seat me. Please take note and make sure someone is ALWAYS waiting to seat your guests. The service once we got to the table was amazing. Our server was very sweet and constantly checked in on drinks and chips and salsa, which was really the best part of the experience. The thing that absolutely pisses me off is that every single time I come in, I have to send my food back because the kitchen does not understand the concept of what a burrito is. The burritos here look like taquitos, small and skinny, with open ends.   Corporate America is downsizing portions everywhere, but it gets to the point where it's downright disrespectful to charge people for such an embarrassment. I really miss the days when I used to come here and get a large burrito, or even something that could be referred to as a 'burrito' for that matter.",

    "text": "After not going to an On The Boarder for about 3 years because of food that was overpriced for the quality and poor customer service my sister and I visited this location on 8/19/17 with the intention of eating soup in the restaurant and taking our dinner home.  As we walked in we noticed there were only five tables seated in the entire restaurant. We were shown to our booth and as soon as I opened my menu I noticed it was covered in bits of food. Our server came over and gave us a half hearted mumble of a greeting; he seemed less than thrilled to be there. We were served chips and salsa but it took about 3 minutes to get our drinks (we never got plates for the chips and salsa). After our server begrudgingly took our order and the soup came my sisters drink was empty for more than 5 min (we timed it) and when the server finally came back over all he said was, \"everything ok?\" and he didn't even offer to fill the drink, we had to ask him. Once our soup was finished we sat for more than 10 minutes waiting for our takeaway and bill. Finally a female server came and took our bowls and said she would tell our server that we were ready to pay. When our server brought our bill it was already split which we had not asked for. During this entire meal the manager was pacing the back of the restaurant and never came over or approached any other tables. My husband is a restaurant manager and works 10 hour days without ever taking a break, I am very well informed of the responsibilities of mangers in the food service industry and how crucial their interactions with guests are. After leaving disappointed we found that there were no chips to go with our salsa and no toppings for our fajitas.  Needless to say we should have stuck with not eating at On The Boarder. Hopefully the restaurant that they put in this location when this one inevitably closes will have better food, service, and management.",

After getting napkins to dry off a place to sit, we were greeted by our server. Nice, solicitous, nervous, really good at apologizing, which will come in handy as the evening progresses. Ordered drinks which took a long time to arrive. Might not have noticed except the server apologized twice. Ordered food, which took a really, really long time to arrive. Might not have noticed, except the server apologized several more times. The restaurant was not that busy, but I can only think that the kitchen was in chaos. The poor server telegraphed his anxiety about what was happening like a public service announcement. Food finally arrived and was barely warm. Chile Relleno looked like a corn dog. We asked for both black and refried beans and got only black. Why give choice of beans if it is served \"family style\" and only one style served? Gave up on fixing that. Burrito was dry. Asked for side of sour cream and guacamole. Got about a tablespoon of each. Gave up on getting more. 2 different people asked if we wanted a take out box, we said yes, no box delivered. After long wait, server picked up payment, asked again if we wanted a box. This time we said no thanks. Server returned with bill and a box (!??). He apologized again. This place is off my list for now. Whatever disaster is happening in the kitchen needs to get fixed quickly!",

He just rolled his eyes and said \"ok, would you like me to get you another one?\"  I said' \"yes, please.\"  He never apologized, just rolled his eyes (I felt like it was a normal finding to him).  To make matters worse, he came back to the table a couple of times and would say \"I am watching for your food and will bring it as soon as it comes up.\"  He did not put a rush on it and I assume he did not tell the a manager since no one ever came to check on us.  Even when he brought the check, he never apologized or acknowledged the hair or mistake.  It is really frustrating, On the Border was a great restaurant, I am not sure what has happened.",

I've tried a few things on the menu- from their chicken burritos to the steak enchiladas and tacos, served with rice and choice of bean. It's all pretty good- better than some but just not as good as other chains (Abuelos).   They typically have decent beers on tap, so ask your server what's available. Get the Dos Equis Amber with a lime! The margaritas are good- you get what you pay for. The cheaper house margarita is pretty weak, add a better tequila for a tastier drink! This place is definitely kid friendly with a special menu, and there's plenty of room so they can blend in with the white noise. Have fun!!",

The On The Border chips that you buy at the grocery store are my favorite.   We stood in the doorway while the bewildered hostess who watched us walk in contemplated lord knows what then finally acknowledged us after the ten people in front of is all going to the same table via the manager were being sat. We waited for about five minutes before a manager just coming on duty asked us if anyone had taken our drink order. We said no. In fact we had yet to even be greeted. All the while our movie deadline looming.   First words out of the servers mouth was apologizing and saying there was a mix up. I I have to give her props as after she took charge found she was very attentive. I drank my soda in about two minutes and upon her first pass by the table after taking our order she had a refill ready. Good job. I told her we were pressed for time and our food came out fast. Our drinks were never empty not was really good service. Food was really good too. I had the three sauce chicken burrito and Jen had the grilled chicken. She was very happy with it. Other than the horrible initial impression which had me convinced this would be a horrible experience, the only down side was that the chips at the restaurant pale in comparison I the ones at the store. Salsa was good though with the perfect amount of heat. Just enough to make your tongue sweat.   I seriously was not thinking this would be a good experience but the server really turned things around to shall I say, I was actually impressed. Good job Erica. We will be back.",

    "text": "Ambiance was great, food was decent, price is a bit much for the quality of the food and service was not good.   Our server was awkward, he never filled our waters, when we asked, he took awhile to come back with more water but he only gave us 1 water, not everyone else :( all the cups were empty. The queso was good though! We did the free queso if you joined their text club for deals. Server forgot to compt the queso at the end.  There was a sweet lady who brought us the food and asked if we needed anything, I asked for sauce and jalapenos and she was so quick and those raw jalapenos were hot :) went will with my burrito. But when I originally ordered I had asked for those jalapenos but what the server ended up writing and translated into me getting my burrito with some cooked bell peppers on top haha others ordered the same thing without the pepper and just got the burrito itself so that was weird but hey it was pretty tasty, probably miscommunication. Our server was awkward, I mean super awkward!  When we asked for the bill he took my card and left for over 10 minutes. I honestly was in a serious food coma and needed to get home and Netflix, you know? But I started to worry if my server was okay, is my card ok? What's he doin? It wasn't that busy and I saw a lot of employees hangin around. Anyways he finally comes by and gives me my card back and runs off. I wanted to tell him thanks for the service but didn't get a chance.   By the way, I saw a lady making fresh tortilla at the back and that was awesome. Reminds me of being back in Mexico ordering tacos from the stand :)  I finally left and KO'ed from major food coma.  Thanks y'all! Hopefully my next experience is much better next time. I believe in you guys!",

The chips were very good those I would go back for only. Not recommended for authentic Mexican food than make my own food.",

The beans had pork flavoring which is bad for those who don't eat pork! The chicken was the smallest I've seen. The enchiladas were dry and red sauce was disgusting. The tacos were good- no complaints there. Overall, I would not recommend this place and I wouldn't go back.",

My husband got a 'gift card' from someone for this restaurant so we decided to spend it last night. The place is cheesy from the get go...the crazy psuedo mariachi music was irritating. However, the service was very good and we got exactly what we expected...and a little more.  We ordered house margaritas and the 'made at your table' guacamole. Both were really good. The chips were warm and crunchy and plentiful and the salsa was OK. Good start.  My husband ordered fajitas that were plentiful and 'pretty good' according to him. I ordered the fish tacos...also pretty tasty. Both were served with pretty bland black beans and rice.  Yes, there were lots of kids and noise and please God, turn off that crazy music...but really when you can have a pretty good meal for that $50 gift card I am satisfied.",

They have special parking for to go order pick ups, too.  Service was fair. My order was ready as posted about 20-25 mins after completing my online order.  The menu was extensive and intriguing/different than other mexican restaurants.  I ordered/created the 3 combo deal.  A chicken enchilada which was filled with chicken and 2 fish tacos.  Wow, when I opened my to go bag.  A huge portion/bag of chips! I mean a bowl full that you'd actually get at a table if you ate in.  Plus salsa (which was med spicy) The chicken enchilada was tasty and creamy.  The fish taco was also a good portion and filled with cabbage.  It didn't come with lime wedges but it was soo good and filling that I didn't even finish the 2nd taco.  I think it was also because I finished the refried beans.  I only took a bite of the rice/corn, which was good but I was already full.  So all of this was in my to go bag and all for $12 and some change.  Wow, so much food in comparison to Rubios' prices.  I've got leftovers for tomorrows lunch! I can't wait to try their margaritas next time I eat in.",

They did OK, if not were very prompt to remove dirty dishes from the table.   Food was alright. Nothing to write home about. You basic run of the mill chain grade Mexican food. Maybe, a bit on the tastier side of the scale, to be honest.   My Corona was good as was my wife's Rita.   All in all, one CAN go there but should one?

She proceeded to again- in a much ruder tone- ask again what are we going to be ordering. After that whole thing, it took forever to get our food back even though there was hardly anyone in the resturant at the time. Then she didn't ask any of us if we needed any refills seeing that 6 out of 11 of us had ran out of our sodas ages ago. Probably won't be going back to this location for quite awhile...",

The hostes welcomed us, grabbed our menus and started walking us to one of the many open tables. The manager suddenly walked up and told her not to seat anyone including us, told her to tell guests there was a 10 to 15 minute wait. We decided to wait. We waited for 20 minutes and the manager came out a few more times telling the hostesses not to seat anyone. After about 25 minutes we left. For a Friday night they were so understaffed, even for a partially filled restaurant. Kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic.",

My husband and I ate here last Friday as we just couldn't decide on a place to eat and since we were across the street from On The Border we just said \"let's go there.\" We had eaten here once before about a year ago and I remember the food being ok, but not good enough to make me good back sooner than a year later.  I ordered the empanadas (sp?), which were decent, but all I kept thinking was \"I know this is  pre packaged frozen food\" and the queso dip is clearly Tostino's brand dip. My husband tried one of their new chimichangas and he said it was pretty decent.  The one thing I really liked about our visit was their version of a mojito. They call it a Mexican mojito and it was pretty tasty. Instead of rum they use tequila.  The staff was friendly and accomodating. The manager even came by and gave us a coupon for a free app on our next  visit. The place was very busy and loud and one very unhappy child that wanted everyone to know just how unhappy he was.  The food wasn't too bad, but I've had better and I will probably go back mainly to use the free app coupon.",

So we decided to stay go grab a drink while we wait, while waiting we noticed that there was almost half the restaurant with open seating & clean tables. At this time it's been almost 20 min & I ask about being seated because of all the empty seats and booths & there wasn't that many people in front of us, the hostess tells me we had to wait for tables to be bussed & for the kitchen to catch up, but if we didn't want to wait we could try to find an open seat at the bar or patio.  If we were told it was a wait time because of understaffed or the kitchen was a little behind we would of understood & left right away but after having to wait & ask then told the bar & patio was open seating we might of stayed as well I mean the place wasn't that busy to begin with when we got there, but we most likely will not be back.",

Where do I start; we sat on the patio which may have been a bad choice since we were the only ones out there. Inside was not too busy though either. Waitress sat us, we said \"we're here for taco Tuesday\" she said \"great\"! She took our order and then we never saw her again. No drink refills, no water refills, no check in to see if we needed anything, we had to go inside to get the bill, then go back in 15 minutes later to pay the bill. Wow!!!  Now for the tacos, we ordered 2 tacos each we thought were off the special taco Tuesday menu..... I guess not! We had chicken tacos, ground beef tacos, in hard and soft shells and one fish taco. Only one was a special $2 taco, all the rest were $4+.... what a joke! I just paid the bill without complaining (since there was no one to complain to) and will go to the many other establishments around for taco Tuesday from now on. And the Tacos were sub par at best.",

    "text": "Yeah, \"just OK\" sums it up.  It's not the experience I recall being a somewhat regular customer of this chain (other state) a decade ago. The salsa was the same recipe - or close and is OK but it's not \"hot sauce\" or even close. The chips were just chunked up corn tortillas and very uninspired. I remember the chips as being a bit better.   On the positive: prices are reasonable for what you get. The dining area was clean. The hostess was friendly. We were greeted and seated right away. A trainee server with a shadow appeared quickly to take drink orders. They were friendly. The meals arrived as ordered. The fajitas and their \"Borderito\" were both \"OK.\"   That's kind of where the positives end.  Endless beans and rice with the fajitas were in massive bowls which seems like a waste since they are \"endless.\" The rice was over-cooked and the beans were bland and had no seasoning at all. Boring.  It was late on a weeknight. The dining area was pretty empty though some late-night regulars were making their way in. This didn't take away from other guests but it's clear there are friendships. In truth, that's probably a good thing. Staff outnumbered guests.  Service was slow out of the kitchen. Follow up for beverage refills was slow. The check was presented with the suggestion that if other drinks or dessert was wanted, the tab could be updated. We asked for to-go boxes (I did say the food was OK), the bill folio was presented on top of one of the open to-go boxes. Nasty! That is contamination and is a training issue that must be addressed.  I've never viewed On The Border (or any of the other Mexican food chains) as a place to go for anything even close to authentic. I go to places like this because they aren't expensive and they have food - usually - with a bit of Mexican-inspired spice and flavor to them. But, On The Border doesn't even measure up on this low standard compared to history.  I think there are better options in the Valley for similar prices.",

We celebrated with Borderita Grande (Lunazul Reposado tequila, Gran Gala orange liqueur ) and the El Jefe (Patron Silver tequila, Patron Citronge premium orange liqueur) Both did the trick and were pretty good. We then ordered the appetizer Chicken Quesdillas and the lunch Classic Burrito (cheese, pico de gallo) with a side of Sour Cream. All the food was good, pretty basic.  The only thing that annoyed us was when we got the bill, there was an extra charge $1 for 2 tablespoons of Sour Cream. When we questioned the the charge we were told it wasn't the \"Sour Cream Sauce\". I notice a lot of restaurants are jumping in this and this is just another one.  All in all a decent celebration.",

MY ONLY COMPLAINT is that the woman who was running out the food was wearing a shirt that was so low cut her chest nearly fell out of her shirt as she bent down to put the food tray and the plates down. This is a family restaurant and I was appalled that the manager on duty allowed her to interact with customers in such a revealing shirt. I will obviously be going back for the food and normally great service, but I hope that this isn't allowed again because there are people in the area far more conservative than I.",

    "text": "Only went because we had a gift cards.  Otherwise, based on the yelp reviews and the fact that it is a chain restaurant we wouldn't have gone otherwise.   The garbage can out front was so full it was spilling out on the sidewalk. The free chips and salsa were okay. The service was not very good at all - the restaurant was almost empty, lots of employees standing around and the food took FOREVER. Kids menu options are good and inexpensive.  The meal comes with main dish, side dish, drink and dessert sundae.   The lunch fajitas were good (except the veggies were cold and had to be remade.)  My son and I shared them and had more than enough food. We were charged 99 cents for a side of queso which was not worth the money. Drinks are $2.49 each!!  Pricey! The kahlua mud pie was $6.50.  It wasn't bad but quite small for the price.  I much prefer the one at Elephant Bar and it is much bigger and less expensive.",

Groupon can't do anything about it because there's a no refund on the certificate.  Very upset that we spent the extra money and the restaurant wouldn't honor the certificate.",

The first Margarita I ordered tasted like overly sweetened fruit punch so I sent it back after one sip. They sent me a house Margarita next, but it warm, watered down, and again way too sweet. I gave up on drinks and tried to eat the bland jalapeno poppers. I made it through all six, but suffered horribly with stomach pains and worse (I'll leave the details out) for a day.   My wife made it through half of her shrimp fajita before giving up. The shrimp were overcooked and lacking jn flavor. Everything just seemed like it was indifferently slapped together. I could have paid half as much for a better meal at Rubio's.  About the only bright spot was the service, which was always with a smile. In short, if you want a meal that makes you feel like you got food poisoning eat here! At least you will get your food quickly and the waitresses don't make faces when you send it back.",

I think the server was pretty new and he might have been double sat so he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  The fajitas don't come with as much meat, or veggies for that matter, than other Mexican restaurants we frequent, but there is an abundance of side items that come with them.  We really liked the nachos as an appetizer because each chip is loaded with beans.",

We were seated right away and the waitress was very pleasant as she took our drink orders. She gave us enough time to peruse the menu and after taking our order, she read back everybody's choices to ensure she had the right information. It took a little longer than usual to get our food, which was understandable since we were such a large group. However, my meal never came out. And the waitress never came back to the table to see if everything was delivered to our satisfaction. I waited approximately 10 minutes before going to find the manager. After telling her what happened, she came to our table and said the kitchen had missed it and it would be out shortly. By the time it was delivered, everyone else had finished their meals. I ate my meal, which was delicious. However, I was a little disturbed when the check came and they did not comp my meal. As a side note our drink glasses remained empty for the majority of the meal. Disappointing experience to say the least.",

To my disappointment, the options were limited. Really limited! I'm well adjusted with a few vegetarian options at several places. However, at On The Border, it was difficult. The Chile sauce for the only two vegetarian Enchiladas was not veg! Thus, I had to go for Ranchera - the only sauce for vegetarians. That being said, I ordered Onion Cheese & Spinach Mushroom Enchiladas. They were stuffy, hard and had a weird taste.     Nonetheless, the real letdown was chips and salsa! I wouldn't claim to know authentic Mexican cuisine. Yet, I'll say this - a Mexican restaurant that cannot put amazing chips and salsa on the table is no good! The chips were thick, salty and partially uncooked.    Apart from this, the service was decent. Just mind your head on the booths with super low lamps. They hover on your head, literally!",

We put our order in, after waiting 10 minutes for a waiter to take our water order, and I had to ask for more salsa, we kept waiting and waiting. Salsa never came, couldn't find my server. She finally comes out of the back and serves another table. By this point, water and salsa and chips pretty much empty. I was waiting on service for too long. We left before receiving any food.

Our waiter, after being very slow with our drinks, finally appeared with a tray of drinks for another table and said \"I'll just drop these drinks at another table and be straight back to take you order for food.\"  Twenty minutes later he reappeared and took our order.  After another 20 minutes of waiting for our food he finally came back to say it would be out shortly.  By this time I had had enough and that I surely hoped it would be out shortly or we would just change our order to breakfast.  He then did the one thing I find completely inappropriate - he said the reason for the slowness was that the kitchen staff was shorthanded. I said \"That sounds like a management problem.  Don't make us suffer because of your manager's inability to do his job properly.  Now, please bring out the food without further delay.\"  That worked and the inept manager actually got off his butt and helped get food out.  The food was so-so.  I had ordered a chimichanga, which I thought by definition is a fried burrito.  It was not fried, but rather compressed in a hot sandwich press, the kind they use for things like Reubens and grilled cheese sandwiches in other restaurants.  The place was not even that busy for a Friday night.  I may give them a second chance, but one more experience like this and I'm done.",

If you're accustomed to the spicier flavors found in the southwest, the food at this restaurant will taste bland.   The chips and salsa are nothing special- it's very much like buying a bag of yellow corn tortilla chips and name-brand salsa and putting it in a bowl. I've had the enchiladas here (the sauce is very tomato-y) and a couple of different combination platters with tacos, chile relleno, tostada etc. Overall, everything was very bland and uninteresting. I don't eat rice and beans unless they're particularly tasty, needless to say I took one bite of each and left them alone. I've also had an appetizer sampler with quesadillas, nachos, and taquitos- it was tasty while drinking but for the price, it's a better deal to put such a snack together at home.   The redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio. It's set up in such a way that very little sun gets in, and there are misters all over. The breeze blows just right so it's always nice and cool outside, even in the middle of the summer.   This might be a good option to come for some drinks and hang out on the patio, but don't expect to be impressed with good Mexican food- you are looking in the wrong place!",

However - I go to a restaurant like On The Border the same way a film buff should approach a Michael Bay movie. I know what I'm getting and I'm not going to act all surprised when it's not the best I've ever had.  That said - I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to On The Border and would return in a heartbeat (especially for happy hour).  Went with a girlfriend for happy hour and ordered a half-price appetizer in the form of their steak quesadilla. It was very large despite the price and really delicious. I used to have a few quesadillas a week during my \"cheese, cheese, and more cheese\" phase growing up - so I hold quesadillas to a pretty high standard. This was a delicious start to the meal.  The girlfriend ordered the pulled-pork baja fajita with salsa, I ordered the chimichanga with beef and queso underneath. Couldn't resist a Dos Equis Ambar for $2.25. They brought it in a goblet that was frozen and as a result there was a bit of slush at the top of the glass but really, when your only complaint is that \"the beer was too cold,\" you know you've had a good dinner.  I had a few bites of hers and completely devoured mine, which was an impressive feat considering I had eaten most of the quesadilla earlier. Everything was delicious and tasted very fresh. The queso under my chimichanga added just the right amount of spice and I was lucky to have arctic-chilled brew in arm's reach.  Like Rand before me, I'm not exactly surprised by the negative reviews I've read for this location but that certainly wasn't my personal experience at this On The Border. Can't wait to go back.",

We ordered 2 apps, the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapenos (YUM) and the chicken quesadilla (double YUM).  Perhaps we were just really hungry, but at like $4 each they were awesome!!!  Also, their salsa is no joke.  It's tasty and spicy, just how I like it.  I only wish they had stopped bringing us the \"bottomless chips\" because I just kept eating that salsa all night.  I would say that their salsa would be on my top 10 list...  Hmm, speaking of a list...  Anyway, if you're in the area and are looking for a good, cheap happy hour, give this place a chance.",

On Monday, as I was leaving Phoenix to head back to southern AZ, I stopped at On The Border with my 2 children to eat lunch before our long drive home.  Brittany seated us and was also our server.  She was lovely and recommended the specials that day, although we didn't go with those.  I ordered the Queso Chicken which was very tasty and perfectly cooked.  My children got the Fajita Chicken Soft Taco and the Build Your Own Mini Tacos(chicken).  They ate every last bite which is rare when out at restaurants as they are very picky. On the Border definitely measures up to their standards which is hard to come by.  Brittany was very attentive, friendly, and efficient while not overbearing.  She knew just what I needed when I needed it.  One thing that I feel bad about was that I paid with Credit Card and placed the tip on the receipt in the space provided.  However, once the charge went through my account, the tip was never charged to my card...leaving Brittany without her tip.  I called but the gentlemen explained to me that there really wasn't anything he could do.  So I would like the manager and anyone else who might visit to know what a great job Brittany did! Thank you for another great experience at On The Border!!!!!",

Also, we got in at 6:57 and the waiter didn't see us till 7:03 but still have us happy hour prices on our initial order. We got out fill, satisfied, and the bill was nothing to shed years over. It's sincerely not Mexican food. The hottest hot sauce they had was Chalula  which is a joke, but i would recommend this place to a friend. I'll just remember to bring my own hot sauce next time ;-)",

After receiving a basket of chips, I almost got full since they were so good! I ordered 2 tacos with no cheese which came out to $8.99.. Okay price but the food should have been better than any other mexican restauraunt that serves tacos... My tacos were outstanding, the rice was a bit cold, my beans were also cold and didn't taste right.",

Chips and salsa are very good, although not hot at all, so we would always pour hot sauce in to add a little heat. The cheese stuffed chile rellenos were good and cheesy, and the soft tacos were pretty good along with the empanadas.  Burritos are huge! Not really a fan of the beans, but you get to choose from refried or black beans, and they have other choices like veggies instead as sides.:)   Very good prices, servers are very friendly and would go back for the margs:) I would say 3 1/2 stars",

We asked for guacamole instead, the guacamole had large (golf ball sized) chunks of avocado, but at least it was fresh. The chimichanga was alright. A food runner ( or a different server) placed hot food right in front of our baby, several times we moved the food but weren't able to grab the scalding hot side of runny sour cream (why is the sour cream scalding hot?) out of the way fast enough and my baby burned his hand pretty badly. I work is the service industry and I thought it was common sense not to put hot things in front of babies.  The manager came over and was very awkward,  he asked \"is he ok?\" and ran away pretty quickly. Our server, Nicholas was polite and professional and got us our bill quickly so we could get out of there. Next time we will go to Los dos molinos or even chipotle if we want decent Mexican food.",

The chips and salsa are great though!    I have avoided this place for years now.  However, the closing of the Macaroni grill (double gift card) and starvation brought me back.  And so, after we received our drinks we didnt see our waitress until mid-way through our meal.  We had to get help from another waiter.  When she finally decided to check on us, I sent my food back and the manager never made it to my table to see why!  We ordered the sampler and I hated it and my daughter got sick!  The service is so bad - You ever been to a place that the service was bad but they took your money super fast!?!?  Well this lady took our money and still took forever to return.  Why?  I was so ready to go.  I immediately remembered why I didn't want to go back!!!!",

Even after a comp meal and $15 off our dinner for 5 and an appetizer (queso and guac, a small soup bowl of semi soft cheese and a plate with a mashed avocado $8.5)  still cost over $60.

Not only because the food is absolutely amazing, but their staff and managers actually care and are present in making sure your experience is the best it can be!  TJ is the service manager, and he is the definition of what a service manager, or any manager should be as far as customer service. He made sure the food was coming out in a timely manner, and kept us in the loop at all times so we wouldn't think we were forgotten about. I mean, it was like 5-star service because he made it a point to make sure we were totally happy and taken care of. TJ also suggested the guacamole that's made table side, and helped bring out the ingredients to make it. It was phenomenal by the way!!!  I've been to \"upscale\" establishments, and not made to feel like I felt here at On the Border. If you're looking for some absolutely amazing, put your taste buds in tilt in a good way Mexican food, go visit TJ and the staff on E Ray road!!!

    "text": "Does this place have a manager?  That was our question to each other when leaving.    Four of us were together and stopped at this restaurant.  We really like Mexican food.  Obviously that had to be the case since this was our third day in a row we were Mexican food at three different restaurants!   No one was in line for a table but we stood for quite a while until the hostess showed up to seat us.  Then, it was another good wait until our waitress appeared.   Drinks arrived and so did the chips and salsa.  We ate the chips but didn't care for the spicy salsa.  By now we were wondering if the waitress would return to take our order.  Evidently, she wasn't in a big hurry to do that.  Chips were pretty much gone by the time we saw her again but we finally got to order.  The order for meals consisted of 3 combination plates of cheese enchiladas and one order of fajitas.  It was another very long wait until our meals arrived.  We were expecting sizzling hot plates as we receive most of the time when ordering Mexican food.  That wasn't the case.   Well, the fajitas came in a sizzling hot plate but the cheese enchiladas did not. The refried beans and rice were served family style with the enchiladas on a separate plate but that plate wasn't sizzling and the enchiladas were not good or hot.  The three of us tasted the enchiladas and none of us liked them.  They were warm (not hot), the red sauce tasted burned and the tortilla tasted a little grainy.  We sent them back and asked for a replacement.  One person decided not to chance ordering again but a ground beef taco in a hard shell was requested by another.   By the time that was received at the table, the person ordering the fajitas was finished.  I think that says just how long the wait was.  A taco eventually arrived which was about 1/3 full of ingredients.  It was a soft shell taco and not a hard shell as ordered.  The approximate teaspoon of meat in the taco was chicken and not ground beef.  That was also sent back.  I know they say the third time is the charm but we weren't going to chance it.    We were not offered refills on our drinks.  The water and tea glasses were empty.  One person asked for more tea.  His tea was refilled but none of the other glasses were.  Terrible food, terrible quality and terrible service.",

Upon entering the Resturant we were immediately greeted by a very friendly hostess and we were seated immediately. Then another very friendly staff person came to our table to chat. We felt very welcomed. Next we got our chips and salsa and queso. Both were very tasty. You could taste the corn in the corn chips and the seasoning in the salsa and the queso was on point. My husband ordered the Cabo grilled shrimp tacos which was accompanied by rice and beans he enjoyed all very much. I ordered the mango salad. The portion was huge. The mango was fresh, the chicken was good and the dressing was delicious. So if you want to \"party like a guac-star\" go to On the Border. P.S. I stole that last line from the shirts on the waiters and waitresses!",

We had never been to an On The Border before and after our meal we felt it had spoiled every other Mexican restaurant we'd been to for us. The manager T.J. was so friendly and welcoming from greeting and seating us to keeping tabs on us throughout our meal to make sure we had everything we needed. It was obvious he loves what he does and takes great pride in the restaurant.  Chips and salsa can be hit or miss at so many Mexican places, either the salsa is good and the chips are lackluster or vice versa. Not the case here. So delicious! Then we ordered the tableside guacamole, chicken tortilla soup and chicken suiza enchildas. Everything was fresh, tangy and so flavorful! I can't remember the last time I had Mexican food that tasted so good.  So from now on, whenever we get a yen for Mexican, you'll find us at On The Border.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying my 2 stars were given because I go to the Gilbert on the border and my experience there has always been great.   Now, to start with the review...I went to dinner last night for 'National Taco Day' and On the border was having a special - $8.99 for unlimited tacos. I went with 5 adults, 2 teens and a toddler. So pretty big group. I wont speak for others experiences but here is mine...I asked for chips and salsa 4 times before it came, my friend wanted water and probably asked for it about 4 times before he just got up and went to get his own. The table next to ours said they'd been waiting for food for 2 hrs and finally the guy got up, went to a gas station, got some cash left it on the table and their group left before the waitress ever came to check on them.   We ordered food about 1.5 hrs in (not because we couldn't decide what we wanted but because service was SO slow). When everyone else got their food...mine was forgotten, my friends was burned. (See picture of fajitas) the waitress said there was an error in the kitchen and she was sorry. 30 mins later she brought my food and said that it would be on her. At this point I still had no silverware. My friend went up and got me some from someone.  I'm thankful my meal was comped, and I understand the perception was that it was busy. My perception was that it wasnt that bad - the 4 tables next to ours were empty and then the table where the other folks left became empty. I'd understand if the waitress said \"hey guys it's really busy tonight, food is taking a little bit of time but not to worry I'll keep the chips and salsa and drinks coming.\" That would have been a different experience than being ignored, having to ask for things multiple times, having to get things on our own and just having an overall bad experience.   Oh and by the way....unlimited tacos really means 2, because no one can wait long enough to get more than 2.",

Jeanine was our favorite server until she moved to the Mesa location and now we have  Christine who is always on top of her game!  A couple of  suggestions: Easy on the salt! you can always add salt to the chips. I assume most people like salty chips but If you decide to stop adding salt to the chips, announce it as part of a \"healthier decision\". The second suggestion is to have a mild salsa if your only salsa is going to be this hot. (I always put a sugar packet to make it milder). Your new additions to the menu are tasty and well made. Keep up the good work!",

The service was terrible...we received the \"what do you want, your bothering me\" attitude from our young female server on an early Saturday night last weekend. Our biggest clue should have been the now hiring sign that we joked about in the parking lot hoping it wasn't cooks. Our order was incorrect and I'm fairly positive the chicken in my 3 sauce burrito was frozen. It was perfectly cubed and had a squishy consistency. My friends veggie burrito came with chunks of partially cooked zucchini, squash and red peppers. The rice was just as bad. The only thing I found appealing were the re fried beans.  Add a $5 draft beer and voila, unhappy customer.",

When we arrived, the parking lot was packed and I wanted to leave, but hubby said, \"Let's go inside and see,\" so we did. Turns out we LOVED the place! The hostess, Sylvia, was so genuinely warm; even though she was busy, she made us feel welcome. We waited only 10 minutes before we were seated inside and then our server, Taylor, came right away to take our drink orders. She was fun and friendly and like Sylvia, made us feel welcome. Next, a young man stopped by with a basket of thin, warm, and very tasty tortilla chips and two bowls of salsa - one for each of us. Wow...I've had to pay for chips that weren't half that good at other Mexican restaurants. And after we plowed through the first basket, he brought more...all delivered with a smile. My husband ordered the stacked nachos and I tried the steak quesadillas. The prices were reasonable, service was fast, food was yummy, and Taylor did a great job of keeping our sodas filled and making sure everything was good at our table. Then T.J., the manager, stopped by to see how we were doing. We were just blown away by the service here, especially since we'd dined at The Thirsty Lion in Tempe the week before and the service was horrible...literally nonexistent. That experience made us very appreciative of the friendly, welcoming atmosphere here. In fact, we had such a great time that we returned the next day for lunch with our son-in-law. I was thinking that maybe things wouldn't be as good the second time around, but I was wrong. This time we sat outdoors on the patio and our server was Shannon - again, so fun and genuinely friendly. Once again, the Chip Guy was great...he just kept the chips and salsa coming and those chips are the best - warm and so crisp. Again, the food was very good (this time, we ordered the Border Sampler, a burrito, enchiladas, and sopapillas for dessert) and we didn't have to wait forever for it to arrive. Plus, they delivered bottomless beans and rice!! Wow...amazing! T.J., the manager, was working again and stopped by to see how everything was...that guy really knows how to take care of his guests. I can't say enough good things about this place; as far as casual dining goes, this On the Border is hard to beat. Great Mexican food, wonderful service, and reasonably priced. We loved T.J., Taylor, Shannon, the Chip Guys, the food runners, and Sylvia the hostess...all wonderful people. Plus TV's in the bar and on the patio made my sports-crazy husband and son-in-law happy. We'll definitely be back.",

We were a party of 6 and had to wait 20 minutes, for a Thursday night, I was surprised the wait was so long. And it wasn't busy, they scrambled for 20 minutes trying to figure out where to put us. The waiter did bring chips and salsa right away after we got our table, and did take our drink orders. Shortly later, our alcoholic drinks arrived, I guess the bar was backed up..? again, the place was dead..?  overall, we will probably never go back, there are way better choiced for mexican food. I was pretty disappointed..",

We went for Happy Hour and we sat on the patio, so we could enjoy the water mister, especially since it was 88 degrees out.  Our server, Gabbi, was outstanding. She was friendly, outgoing and helpful. Rosco, a very friendly guy, brought our food out to us and made sure that we had all that we needed to complete our meal. TJ, the assistant manager, popped out and made sure that every table had exactly what they needed to enjoy their dining experience.  The cocktails, Coronaritas, were amazing and the food was absolutely delicious with tons of flavor. We're going back again tonight!  A huge thank you to the staff at this location.",

    "text": "Customer service? No thanks.  Tonight, we visited On the Border,as we've done many times in the past. We're down, visiting from Prescott, just looking for good mexican food.  As empty as the restaurant was, we were kind of surprised as to the lack of service, but we see that alot... moving on. The waiter finally arrived, took our drink order and asked if we would like any guacamole or queso. We were good. I looked through the menu and selected a light veggie bowl. The picture of the rice, beans and avocado sold me.  I held the menu open and pointed to the picture of my selection.  I sat there, nibbling on chips and the little bit of salsa we were served, and looked forward to my veggie fiesta bowl with mushrooms and avocado. When I received my dinner, it was missing the avocado. I called the waiter over and pointed out that there was no avocado.  His response was that they had a shortage of avocado... They were preserving what they had for those that ordered the guacamole... \"Company Policy\". Can I have a little side of guac then?  No, sorry... Company policy.  So, I ordered a meal that features an ingredient that you HAVE back there, but you can't give me the main feature of my meal because it's company policy to reserve the ingredient for those who might come in later?    To say the least, I was floored!!! I ordered a meal that featured an image of avocado... yet, I was informed that the company policy was not to hold up to ingredients of meals that current customers ordered... but to instead, withhold those ingredients... just in case some future customer came in later to order something else with that ingredient. Coincidentally a more expensive, higher profit item on the menu.   I spoke to the waiter and the manager, and both smiled as they informed me that this is simply how it will be... company policy.  We received our bill and the meal was actually priced $1 more than the menu.    On the Border has extremely mediocre food, processed tasting salsa... but we've gone back because the ambiance is good and the food is fair.   I am a small business owner, so this experience put the nail in the coffin.  Customer service should be any business's priority. How on earth can it be ok to treat the future potential money spenders with a higher priority than the current customers?  I was told that this limitation would last for a few more weeks.  This is not a 1 night problem. This is a problem that stems from company policy. Why not use the ingredients to satisfy a customer that sits in your restaurant and take a chance on disappointing the future customer... FOR SHAME On The Border!!    I would rather go to a place that has horrible food with great respect to the people paying for it, over a place that would rather take a chance at wasting food for the potential future customer, over the ones currently sitting in their restaurant.    PATHETIC!",

    "text": "Very good place for an afternoon lunch.  My guest and I  each ordered the classic burrito, one with chicken, one with steak.  The steak burrito seemed to be abundant with meat.  The chicken, not so much. Still tasted good.  Of course you have the unlimited chips and salsa beforehand which is great.  The chips here are huge and perfect. Light and crispy with just the right amount of salt. The salsa seemed to have a little kick, but after the initial burn, you get used to it. I checked in with Yelp when we got there and surprise, I got free queso!!! Thank you Yelp!!! The queso was delicious. I even put some on my burrito. There are several sauces to choose from to top your burrito. I played it safe and went with the sour cream sauce. Good choice. Also, your entree comes with unlimited beans and rice, but you'll be too full to eat them all. I must mention, I ordered a side of guacamole and it literally was a tablespoon of it. A little disappointing since I love guac. The people were all very friendly, the establishment was clean, food was hot and fresh and quick to the table.  Worth a shot if you're in the area.  9/9/17 Had a wonderful lunch again. This time I got the shredded beef in my burrito. Great choice as the meat was incredibly flavorful and tons of it! Way better than the chicken. I also got the queso sauce on top. Yum, yum, yum.  Chips and salsa were amazing yet again. Our server, Nick with the short hair, was great, very attentive and friendly. This restaurant has improved over the years. I will definitely be going back. And thank to Yelp! I got 20% off my bill for checking in. I  you Yelp!!!  2/2/19 Came in for lunch and had the classic burrito with shredded beef and queso sauce. It was delicious! Again, the meat was flavorful and plentiful. I didn't have to hunt for a piece of meat like at some rWhoever was working the kitchen today did a great job!   They start you out with ginormous chips and salsa, which are free, yesss FREE! The chips are perfect...light with just the right amount of salt. The salsa is chunky and mild so you can easily down several bowls. The problem is exercising self control so you still have room for your entree.  Our server Gabby was great, very friendly and checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The portions are large and I always have to take half home, which is great, because then I can enjoy it again.   The manager Tonya was so nice and friendly. She chatted with us and thanked us upon leaving and invited us back again which we will definitely be doing! I highly recommend it. (Chatting with Tonya AND returning for the excellent food and service!)   3/2/19 We had a lovely dinner with Shannon V. as our server.  Food was great and service was great. Shannon V was so attentive and came to check on us numerous times to make sure we had everything we needed. She is very nice as well. I highly recommend sitting in Shannon Vsection!  3/16/19 Sat on the patio to enjoy the weather and enjoy some Mexican food. Everything was delicious and our server Aly was professional, nice and did a great job. The servings are abundant and tasty. You will not leave hungry!",

    "text": "I was very compelled to write a yelp review as soon as I left but thought I would message the company directly first. With no reply (which doesn't surprise me) here I am writing the review that is much deserved.   Our service was TERRIBLE when we dined in over the weekend. The first server took our drink order and then we never saw her again. About 10 minutes later a different server brought us out drinks. When I asked if he could send our server over so we could order he said \"oh she went home so I will be taking over\". Ooook? Anyway, this server set a HOT plate down right in front of my one year old after stating the plate was too hot to touch. Does he not understand he could have caused severe burns on my sons hands if he would have touched it? I couldn't believe he wasn't patient enough for us to move some other plates (that he didn't bother clearing) out of the way. I sacrificed my own hands and burned them so I could get the plate away from my child.   We didn't have waters for the first 10 minutes we were there and we just seemed to be a waste of the servers time. This was the first time we had ever been here and while the food was good, I don't see a reason to come back with such careless and awful service. Mind you, there were very few customers there and a table shouldn't be treated the way we were.   Oh and we were charged for the \"free\" queso we asked for from the text club and when we asked to have it removed from the bill the server looked annoyed. Even though he made the mistake of charging us. What a waste of a $60 Sunday dinner! Never again.   *kudos to the kitchen, the fish tacos were great.",

But I need to give a special shout out to this location. Came in super late on a Friday after a stressful day. Restaurant was impeccably clean. Even though we were in late, the food was fast and flawless and everyone was smiling. But the person who really made a difference was our server, Shannon V. She was Extremely nice - even when we devoured three baskets of chips in about ten minutes. My kid was super tired after the long day, and I felt like she went over and above to cheer her (and all of us!) up. I live a little far from this location, but I will make the drive to come back for sure. Definitely recommend you stop in here. Best On the Border I have been to in fifteen (!!!) years.",

    "text": "Good Happy Hour and variety but slow.  Big chips and a decent salsa along with a large $3 margarita had this place out to a good start. There are many vegetarian options on the menu, just remember to ask for cilantro rice and black beans as the sides.  The speed at which the food came out was my big concern we stopped in for some enchiladas and a margarita and we were there for 1.5 hours. Over twice as long as we would be at a similar Mexican spot. Factor in kids and things can get a bit difficult.  My spinach and mushroom enchiladas with the queso sauce were good. Topped with a castrated jalapeno slice (spicy parts removed) The frozen margarita was surprisingly strong. Service was decent but it could not fix the slow kitchen. As we left people mentioned a 45 min wait which seems excessive for a Thursday night.",

    "text": "Came to this location of On The Border a couple of weeks ago with a gift card that we had received for Christmas. It was pretty awful. Service was extremely slow for starters and the chips were cold and overly salted.  I ordered a sampler plate with a cheese enchilada, beef taco and cheese crisp. It also included rice and beans. It took about 20 minutes to come out and when it did, it had a very long black hair right on the top of the beans. It was extremely visible and I do not know how no one could have noticed this before it was served. I understand that sometimes sh*t happens, but this was ridiculous and disgusting. I was quite turned off to the whole experience at this point. It took a good 10 minutes to get the attention of our waitress to bring out a different plate. She apologized and was quite embarrassed by the whole situation. She asked if I wanted another plate and I hesitantly agreed. About 15 minutes later I had a new plate. I really wasn't very hungry after all of that but I did try the cheese enchilada which was really just okay. The cheese crisp was semi cold and soggy.  I do not know what has happened lately but this place has gone down hill fast. I will no longer be dining here.",

The first time, we got several alcoholic drinks that were pretty great (and big!), and the food was seriously delicious.   Tried it again a few days ago, and had the very same -- maybe even a BETTER experience. The waiter, (Robert?) was so friendly, and helpful, and patient -- even with some of our party's more picky/particular requests.   Both times here I believe I've gotten what's called the Del Rio (?) combo -- SO freakin good. Fish taco, enchilada.. the tortilla chips they bring at the beginning are even good, very lightly salted and the salsa is fantasstic.  Maybe this isn't a bona-fide Mexican place, but it certainly ranks way above your Taco Bells. The food is of excellent quality and tastes GREAT.  Highly recommended. I don't believe you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "Good food, horrible service. We haven't been to On the Border for many years since we don't live near one. Decided it was worth the drive since we got a Local Flavor voucher. Waitress was prompt in getting our drinks and taking our order. We ordered the trio (with chicken fajitas), two kids meals, and I ordered a fajita bowl. We specified several times that one of our daughter's meals could not have cheese as she is allergic. Even asked to make sure the beans did not get cheese sprinkled on it.   After that it went downhill. The food seemed to take awhile to come out. We had to wave down the waitress after awhile because our girls were hungry and we were out of chips (she had not checked on us after she took our order).  No plates, napkins or silverware have been brought to the table so we tried our best not to make a mess eating salsa and chips without napkins.  Our food finally comes out and is brought by someone from the kitchen. We noticed cheese on the taco and on the beans of our daughter's meal. Told the guy she could not eat cheese. He promptly took it back (no apologies from him or the waitress). The dish came back - no cheese on the taco, but still cheese on the beans. I didn't want to say anything else since we didn't want to have to wait for her dinner any longer. Asked the waitress for some napkins and utensils since she did not notice we didn't have any. We waited and watched her go to other tables after she left us, filled up drinks at one, took an order from another and disappeared into the kitchen. After what seemed like another eternity, she came with silverware and napkins for us. My husband and my dish required utensils to eat - it wasn't like we had tacos, etc. where we could use our hands. Would have been nice if she went straight to the kitchen to get our utensils so we could eat. Maybe it was the job of the hostess to have left us with some utensils and napkins?  My husband had ordered the trio which comes with soup, fajitas, and dessert. He realized when we got our meal that he never got his soup. We had to wave our waitress down for the soup. She made a comment that she had put the order in. She never came back to check on us after that.   We tried to wave her down several times but she did not see us. Finally got her attention and she was about to give us our bill (without bringing desserts for three out of the four meals that came with desserts). We asked if we could substitute one of the desserts for our girls since she could not have the ice cream that comes with the meal but possibly one sopapilla instead. She said she would have to ask and whoever she asked was kind enough to let us substitute the dessert for our daughter. We got our desserts and had to ask for water. She came back and filled only one cup of water when there were two set out for her at the edge of the table together for her to fill up (we didn't realize she only filled one until after she left)! She brought us our check again, we gave our credit card for payment and it seemed like forever again before we got the credit card receipt again. In and out in just under two hours, on a Sunday night and there were only a few tables besides ours (not at all busy). Our youngest commented she never wants to return since she had to wait so long. This is from a little girl that loves to go out and eat at restaurants.",

I think there's only one or two in all of Arizona  I decided to go back and give it another shot... Because I remembered I love the salsa in the queso of dip.  The salsa is still awesome... But that cheese dip is like a goopy mess.   1) salsa is great  2) cheese dip is not good at all anymore.  Actually it's better if you buy it in the grocery store in the jar and then heated yourself. It tasted better than what they serve supposedly fresh  3) the fish tacos were mediocre at best... They fried the fish they didn't offer a grilled option  It's American Mexican food... So it's worth three stars for what it is. But don't text suspect exceptional food. It's also a chain restaurant... However the food here was better than some local Mexican restaurants I've been to",

Tonight blew away our expectations and we had great food and the best service we've ever had from a server.   Nicholas ( our server ) was the most attentive and helpful server in our history of visiting restaurants. Ever. Anytime we were low on chips and salsa, drinks, or other needs; he was immediately there with a refill. He provided me recommendations on meals so that I could try something new. He was extremely polite, and even gave a bit of a bow as he left to continue his rounds with other customers and each time he returned he always greeted us with a smile.  After the meal was over he was quick with helping to process the check and even brought our to-go boxes neat and organized to make it easier to store our remaining food.  I would recommend visiting this location and asking for Nicholas as your server!",

Usually, the service is pedestrian - but with a warm, friendly tone to enhance your evening.   Tonight, expectations were met - sort of.   The food was good - not great - just what we were in the mood for - Tex-Mex in the same vein as every other restaurant in genre.  We had the combo plate and Fiesta Chicken and both were full of flavor but nothing original.   Our server was quick and attentive and nice - but had the attitude, face and posture of an individual who may never see happiness again. We wanted to give him a hug.   Ultimately, we came in with no expectations and left with no expectations. All-in-all, a very Buddhist evening.",

You can tell he is the kind of person that cares about his employees and everyone's experience at his establishment.

Our server took our drink and food order at same time...5 minutes goes by and we ask our server for water...10 minutes later, no server no water. One of the hostesses walked by and we asked her for water. She said she would find our server. I stated we asked him 10 minutes ago and he never came back. She walked away with a audible sigh, returned with 2 glasses of water set them on table and walked off...another server walked by (15 mins by now) and we asked him if he could find the 2 margaritas we ordered. He returned with them and was very nice. Another 10-15 mins goes by and hey, our server comes over and asks how we are doing....we didn't answer him and he said I promise your food will be here soon. 10 mins or so goes by and someone (not our server) brings our meals which were very good. Fast forward another 30 minutes and our server drops our check off.   He didn't ask us one time during our meal if we needed anything or how our dinner was. Between him not being on the ball and the hostess with attitude, we won't be returning to this location.",

Or could it have been???  I waited 8  minutes and he saw I had no water or chips yet and brought them to me.  I ordered a chicken taco (crispy) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada.  The  tortilla  soup never came. I was charged for the combo though. When I asked her she explained I needed to order a combo of three items to get the soup- but it doesn't say that.  The crispy taco was great. Delicious shell, moist chicken and good flavor. I really anticipated that spicy ( it was marked as such) enchilada.  It was... Sweet! They added their corn in the enchilada. The corn is sweet. Ugh... A sweet enchilada. I asked to replace it with a regular cheese enchilada- which I took s photo of, It was good.  Chain restaurant good.   I wish we had those hole in the wall authentic restaurants here in the Foothills.   The menu looked good- lots of choices. And they have a home made tortilla station. That's cool- but I didn't try them. Can't decide if I'll give this another shot or not. Depends on how desperate for Mexican food I get!",

My grandma cannot eat spicy food but loves soup and Amanda was kind enough to bring her a small sample so that she could taste it. She decided it was too spicy and Amanda was great with suggesting alternatives. The manager was also a great help with refilling our drinks. Thank you!",

    "text": "This place has gone down hill. It used to be one of our fav restaurants to go to, but not anymore. Went here tonight, and the wait for the food was really long (45 mins), some of the food was cold, and half of the meals weren't all that tasty. On top of all this, it was expensive. $1 add on for an immeasurably small glop of guacamole, sour cream, and 3 tiny slices of avocado. EACH! At the prices of the food here, that is not acceptable nor appreciated.   To be fair, two of our six meals were really good. Two were pretty good. One was okay, and the 6th was awful.   The service was poor. Long periods of time with no server around.",
