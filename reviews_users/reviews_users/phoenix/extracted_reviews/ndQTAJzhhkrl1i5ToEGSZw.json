Nor would I have imagined cooking a cracker-thin pizza crust to use for dipping in said guacamole. But oh my Lord was that combination delicious! And the fact that we had more chunky guacamole than \"chips\" to dip with was quite the pleasant surprise. Where for $8 can you get an overflowing bowl of fresh, delicious guac other than here?  I also have to mention how adorable the place is. All the throwback decorations made the vibe really fun.  I cannot give this place full stars simply because of how uncomfortable the booths were. The seats really need to be replaced because everything is so warped that one person could be sitting a full six inches taller than another on the same bench. Same goes for the single person bathroom. I can't imagine coming here on a busy day with only one bathroom.",

Everything was fresh & tasty. Our pie came out in 30-35 minutes & was well worth the wait - delicious & very filling. We ended the meal with a chocolate chip cookie pie dessert & it was awesome, too.   GREAT food, good service & reasonably priced. We'd definitely return. I'd really give this place 4.5 stars.

They have a wide variety of toppings but the one thing not on their menu that you can request for is pepperocini. It is especially suitable if you are getting another meat topping, which I often get their sausage.   In addition to their pizza, you have to at least try their pizza cookie ones. It is serve warm straight from the oven, just when the cookie tastes the best - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It is way too huge for one but if you are with a few good friends and don't mind digging into the same cookie, definitely get it!  I have experienced only great and friendly services there but there are times when the waiting can be a little too long. This is because it is close to the university and is often the celebration place so can be a little crowded. I recommend going a little earlier or later than the usual lunch or dinner crowd to avoid the long wait.",

Then we ordered and I got the Zani Ziti bread bowl. When it arrived, it looked good and it tasted good. The manager came by and asked how it was and we said good. After eating half of the pasta and finally getting to the bread bowl, I realized the bread part was black and burnt, so I couldn't even eat the bread. I didn't want to complain or say anything about it because I already ate half of it so it'd look weird because I already ate part of it. But that was my fault. Our waiter tried to get us to get 3 pizookies and we were like no we can't eat that much so we just ordered one. So the experience was good until the end. We paid for the bill and we literally waited probably 20-30 minutes for our check and then we asked for the check back and our waiter wasn't even planning on giving us back the change. He was going to keep it. So we got the change back but not all of it, just the bills because he said there was just some change. It was annoying. I don't like when waiters keep the change when we didn't say you can keep the change. I feel like they should give us back the change and we can decide how much we want to tip him. Our meal was only $24 and we did still tip the $6, but it was the fact that he wasn't even going to give it back for us to decide how much we wanted to give him.",

My four favorites are the \"Italian Gold wings,\" \"Numero One-O,\" \"Bistro Sweet Po's,\" and French Fries.   The Italian Gold wings are chicken wings cooked with a honey mustard BBQ sauce. The Numero One-O is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and green onions.   The Bistro Sweet Po's are sweet potato fries. And as for the French Fries, they are crispy and ruffled!   Oh yes, and DO try the dessert. I recommend the Chocolate Chip dessert, which is essentially a hot pizza cookie -- made entirely of chocolate chip.   Prices from about $5 to $9 for appetizers. Pizza prices range from about $14 to $23.   There are also lasagnas, pastas, and sandwiches -- all of which are good.",

What a disappointment it was to be hosted by one of the most inattentive servers in my dining experience.  Couldn't tell you his name because he never introduced himself.  Took our drink and dessert order and came back only once to check on us.  We had to guess what the bill was and leave some cash on the table because he never came back to drop off the check.  In his defense, he was pretty busy with all of his other tables who were looked more promising of a bigger tab!  So, we enjoyed our Pizookie without any napkins (and with a toddler, this was a bit of challenge).  Just some thoughts about our experience tonight, think I will continue to get my Pizookie at Zipps Sports bar and grill where the skillet is bigger, and they actually notice customers sitting at the table.",

    "text": "This place does Italian well and has great staff.  I am especially fond of their pizza and bowl of pasta.  The bowl of pasta delivers a great angel hair noodle with delicious sauce and unlimited refills.  Their salads are also to die for.  The best thing on the menu is the pizookie or pizza cookie.  It is totally original to Oreganos and if you have not tried it and you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend it.  Its a huge thick cookie freshly baked in a special tray topped with three scoops of freezing vanilla ice cream.  Absolute bliss!",

    "text": "I have eaten here over 200 times. So as you read you can see this as a regular's bias or as an Oregano's expertise opinion.  First of all, don't ever waste your time with the sandwiches. They are too big, the bread is too hard, and you can find something better down the street at Cheba Hut. The meatball sandwich is ok, however you would be better served to simply order a side of the meatballs.   As for what you should order, let's start with pasta. There are four or five pastas that will change your life. The first is the Big Rig. It is rigatoni pasta with a creamy chipotle tomato sauce. It has a good amount of heat, but that can be countered by ordering it with grilled shredded chicken. The Big Rig is my favorite dish. The Bollo Pasta is excellent (with chicken or meatballs), the Ziti is good (although the bread bowl is gross and kitschy), the alfredo the dark is also nice and lighter than most of the other pastas. I would also recommend the big ol' ravioli if you are in to ricotta but make sure to order it with the sausage or meatballs. Mmmmmm. The chicken lasagna is also amazing...but it takes 25 minutes and is often over cooked.  Now to the pizza. The thin crust is great. The pan is average .The deep dish is special. I have had Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Maltati's, even Pacxi's in SF...none of them compare to Oregano's. It takes 45 minutes, but grab some boom dip, a beer, and enjoy the AZ heat while you wait for pizza heaven. I recommend just getting sausage and peppers. Classic Chicago.  You must end all meals with a Pizzookie. This is not a BJ's quality pizookie. This is perfectly undercooked cookie (PB, chocolate chip, or white chocolate macademia) topped with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream. The best part is the crusty edges. Yum, yum, yum.  A warning: portions are HUGE. You will be better served to split something or you will exit this restaurant like you are 5 months pregnant.   I have been to all of the locations, including Flagstaff and Tucson, and the Tempe digs are definitely the best and most consistent. Go early or expect quite a wait. Especially during the school year.  Enjoy!",

Its reasonably priced, the portions are huge, and the drinks are tall. don't expect anything CRAZY culinary creations here, its just not part of the restaurant's culture. The food is simple and everything is tasty.   I usually go with the Sausage Sandwich, or one of the pasta dishes with whole grain pasta, and one of their giant meat balls. Its always filling,  always good.  Sure the wait is long, but they always have free pizza, drinks, and deserts while you are waiting.   Service is always great. Friendly, prompt, and they don't bother you when you don't need them. All of the servers are always willing to play along with my friends and our inappropriate conversations, challenges, etc.",

    "text": "New in town to catch a few Spring Training games (go Angels!), I did some research ahead of time to find some good places to eat.  Oregano's was getting glowing reviews in several places, so we decided to give them a try.  Great choice!  A funky local place with a good vibe & so much personality!  Their backstory is on the menu & is worth the read.  We were starving & there was a pretty long wait, so we just grabbed 2 seats at the outdoor bar to eat there instead of waiting 45 min. for a table.  Our servers couldn't have been nicer (or cuter, says the husband), and sitting at the bar gave us a chance to visit with them more than if we had been at a table.  Plus, we got to watch old reruns on grainy black & white TV's while we listened to old rat-pack music.  Loved that!  The menu was huge, but we settled on the Aunt Margherita Pizza, add pepperoni.  Not very adventurous, I know, but we were starving & didn't want to chance any bad surprises.  A stuffed or pan pizza would have been more fun but, again, STARVING & didn't want to wait.  Did I mention we were starving??  Anyway, our pizza came out on a super thin, crispy crust and oh-so-yummy.  Although it did seem a little bit dry, so we asked for more sauce; but other than that, delicious.  And not too bread-y, like some pizza can be.   While we were waiting for our food to come out, they came around with samples of another thin crust pizza, Lawrence's Original, I think it was.  There was much more going on with that than the one we ordered.  Lawrence's is the one we'll order next time.  Either that or not arrive so hungry, so we can stand the wait for a stuffed or pan pizza 'cause they looked AWESOME!  (Also, note to self: carnivores should not take menu suggestions from vegetarian servers.)  Wish we had room for a pizzookie for dessert.  Next time..... (and there WILL be a next time).  I think Oregano's would be a better experience with a bigger group -- even just a party of 4 or more.  That way you could try a few different things & work your way thru their extensive menu.  But this was an overall fun experience & well worth the effort!!",

    "text": "I had nothing but great things about Oregano's.  I was there for the first time this past Tuesday the 10th of March.  Two of us for lunch and cocktails and started of with the Boom appetizer and it was GREAT!  We both ordered the angel hair pasta on the menu with alfredo sauce on mine and meat sauce and my friend's dish.  I also ordered the Caesar salad.  The dressing was left of the salad, when I mentioned this, they brought me a small container of dressing.  WRONG!!!  I have worked and managed restuarants, always take it back and make the salad right, it can be done really fast.  I didn't finish the salad because the salad was slightly wilted.  Our pasta dish for each arrived, and the alfredo sauce had no taste at all and the pasta was all broken into pieces and kind of mushlike.  I brought this to their attention and they said their alfredo sauce is not the traditional alfredo.  That is for sure cause if was embarrassing.  They asked me if I would like to order anything else and I responded that I was not impressed with 2 out of 3 strikes  being really bad.  Manager came over and apologized.  That was it!  My friends pasta was mush also but she just asked for more meat sauce and dealt with it.  Overall a really poor representation of Oregano's and in no way enticing to return and no care expressed.  Not a drink comped nor my friends lunch comped.  ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO RETURN.",

We went on a Saturday and had a party of 8 - the wait was about 90 minutes which was fine, we expected that for a Saturday evening. When we were seated, we ordered pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it took 1.5 hours to get our food - we did not order any of their deep dish, so we have no idea why it took that long. Our waiter kept telling us that our food would be out 'any minute'. By the time the food came out, which was pizza other than my order of pasta, my pasta was ice cold and didn't include any chicken which I specifically ordered. At that point I asked the waiter to just remove it from the bill and luckily my friends shared their pizza with me. I definitely cut some slack for busier nights, but this was just too much gone wrong.",

We called in about an hour ahead to let them know we were coming with a large group, and we're told that they would be able to accommodate us. When we arrived, it took some time to set the table, but we were seated in about 15 minutes.   Everyone sat down, pursued the menu and our waitress took our drink orders. After returning with our drinks, she took our food orders. This is where the trouble begins.   We are still here, 1.5 hours AFTER we placed our food orders, and still NO food for the majority of our party. Several other tables that were seated had after us have already received their orders.  The food that was delivered to the table after 1.5 hours was luke warm at best.    A member of our party finally asked for the manager and we were told the kitchen \"forgot\" our order.  To which I ask, how does the kitchen \"forget\" a 20 person order?  I understand that the food takes a while to cook, especially for a large group, but 1.5 hours is completely ridiculous.   We all were very excited to try this restaurant as it came highly recommended by someone in our party, but we will not be returning to this restaurant due to this incident.",

I had the calamari, antipasto salad, and veggie pizza (don't recall the name--olives, artichoke hearts, spinach, etc.) I also don't like when restaurants nickle and dime you. They charged extra when we requested more sauce for the calamari (which came with too little sauce for dipping). It was a small fee--so why do it and engender annoyance in your customers?",

If you order the Deep Dish Crust Pizza, be careful!  We had no idea it would have SO much cheese.  We thought the cheese would just be in the crust but it was ALL ALONG the bottom of the whole crust.  My body wasn't feeling that and fearing that we would \"pay for it in the morning\", we asked for a flat crust pizza as a replacement.  The manager was really great about accommodating us (thank you!) but unfortunately in all the confusion, the waiter forgot to put in our order for the Pizza Cookie which we ordered as soon as we sat down *sad face*.  We wound up going back to the original location in Mesa the next week and yummed that up!",

Once you sit down, you realize you're in another place. You're not in AZ, you feel like you're in a whole different city!   Our server was Rhys. Not only does Rhys have an amazing name, but his conversation skills and ability to make the table laugh was making our occasion at dinner fun, exciting and delicious.   He always refilled our drinks without even asking and wasn't over the top. He was SO good, that we gave him a hefty tip knowing we would come back and ask for him specifically. At one point, I dropped my wallet without even knowing it and he nicely notified me!   This couldn't have been a better place to spend a Thursday dinner or even any lunch or dinner, to spend at Oregano's.   For the Horde!",

You may be in for a wait though...just bring some friends and hang out and the wait will be enjoyable.  :-)  When I was a student, I would order the bowl o pasta - free refills of pasta!  I think I used to get it with marinara and chicken.  The pasta is angel hair - it is delicious.  Also, try the garlic bread with cheese.  :-)  I used to also get the desert - chocolate chip cookie in a pizza pan with ice cream - out of this world!

The best pizza they have is unfortunately no longer on the menu because it was a pain to make but they do decent enough pizzas and have a great caesar salad. They also have decent hot wings.

We also like the big Caesar salad with Balsamic Dressing...winner, winner chicken dinner. I have to order a deep dish sausage pizza and take home the leftover to have for lunch at work. Love it!

    "text": "We had a really terrible experience tonight, and so bad, it does not bear a repeat visit.   We asked to be seated for 7 outside. We waited several minutes for them to assemble two tables together. That wasn't bad, but was frustrating, as we kept standing by these two tables.   Once we ordered our dinner, it took 50 minutes to receive a message from a 'mgr', that there was a hole in the dough and a pizza had to be remade. She asked if we wanted to wait 10 minutes for the remade pizza - this was insulting to me, so I said no way. Take it off the bill and feed everyone else. 50 minutes to wait for food and then it still wasn't ready?   Once everyone got the food, we ordered our cookie dough sundae, as we figured that would take forever. It took 10 minutes. So, after 50 minute wait for food, we got a sundae before everyone was done eating. They didn't ask if we were ready, they didn't ask to clean plates, they just dropped the sundae on the table.   So, to wrap up, no communication was given that we were in for a long wait for food - on top of it, we had to ask several times where the food was, and then 50 minutes in we were given a choice to wait longer for the whole order or have the other food brought out now.   We were provided the ice cream sundae complimentary, and the pizza was taking off the meal - but given time waited, the lack of communication, and overall service - I didn't walk away satisfied or made whole.   The worst service and experience I've had at a restaurant in some time.",

There is about a half pound of large shrimp so if you love the little critters, it will make you happy. Our pizza crust (thin) was perfect and topped with fresh ingredients. Service was top notch and we can't wait to go back when we visit again. The menu has the history of the family and the mom and dad's recipes are noted on the  items in the menu. They have included some Southwestern fair such as substituting poblano peppers instead of sweet etc. It's near ASU so its got a little bit of that college vibe going on. BTW the salads are HUGE...a large would feed 4 guests. DO go if in the area!",

American-Italian pizzas and pastas sounds pretty simple, but Oregano's is one of those places that's a must try.  With several locations from Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Tucson; you really don't have much reason not to go!    This time around I ordered the Clark St. Meat pizza along with trying out my friends anti-pasto salad.  Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.  Tad bit of spice and no need to add more peppers to heat it up - yum!    Overall, food was great and service is very good.  Well trained staff members, courtesy and attentive - A plus in my book! Enjoy!",

For the bad - This was not a great night for Oregano's for me,  For some reason they chose not to punch in my order and therefore did not make my order.  I mentioned this to the wait person twice before she caught on that I did not receive my food.  They offered to make it but by the time it would have come out everyone would have been done so I declined. Someone else in the group ordered the steamed broccoli and it came drenched in butter (that did not agree with their diet).    The girls got a pizza and were very happy with it.    To make up for things they brought out one of their cookies and took a little off the check.  We had several managers come by and apologize for the wait's mistake.  What kind of upset me was the wait did not apologize until we paid for the meal and were walking out the door.  I would have thought she would have been the first one to apologize.",

Ordered the \"Jumbo Chicken Parm Pasta\" that's marketed as having \"HUGE all natural chicken breast served on a bed of fettuccine\" but yet when I got my order it came with a handful of pasta and a chicken breast the size of an Oreo... and they have the audacity to charge $11 for that? Yeah no thanks, not going to return and waste money on that again",

My friend urged me to try the meatballs, he said they were the best and I thought they were just okay.  I also felt that way about my Caesar salad, it was nothing special.  They could have jazzed it up some to make it a little different.  He had the meatball sub, which he loved (he gets is every time) but like I said, I set higher standards for Italian.    Make sure to come early for lunch or dinner, this place gets busy quick otherwise you will have to sit in the undesired heat on the patio at this location.",

    "text": "My belly smiles when thinking of Oregano's   I used to go here all the time when I lived in Tempe but then I moved away and ever since then, I've been craving it, go figure.   So when I was out on Easter morning in Charlotte and saw a chick wearing an Oregano's shirt, I knew I had to have it on my next trip to AZ.   Game on!   I love this location mostly in part due to the proximity of campus and their outdoor patio. We stopped in for lunch last week and they promptly seated us and right in front of a fan to cool us off. I was praying that I put on my deodorant and smelled ok because I didn't want my so-called-stink to be flying all over the patio area.   Service was fantastic-most of the server seem to be students and are so enthusiastic, you would kind of want to slap them if they weren't so nice.   I never knew they had lunch specials such as pizza slices, pasta and salad so I went with a slice of pizza but before that there was thing I had to have,   Boom Dip.   It's a spinach and artichoke dip so delicious and cheesy they if I try really hard, I can taste it. They changed up the bread they serve with it and it used to have a kick of spice to it but this time it didnt. No worries because I was going to wipe that bad boy out.   If only I could get it overnight delivered, sigh.",

    "text": "FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!   Obviously you can't go wrong with their food, that's definitely never the issue. My boyfriend and I LOVE this place and have only been disappointed with their food once.  I usually have OK service (have never had great customer service here) but the last time I visited I was sooooo disappointed.   We only get a 30min lunch break at my job, so we are always looking for places that will allow us to order take-out. Two weeks ago it was my friend's last day, and we wanted to go out to lunch as a group to wish her well and to spend time away from the office for lunch. My co-worker called this location a couple hours before we planned to eat to see if we could place our order ahead of time, but eat there and order drinks with a server. (We obviously planned to tip the server for our food purchase as well) Even though the girl said that would be fine over the phone, it was a nightmare when we got there.   We were scolded by some blonde woman (I'm assuming a manager?) because they \"don't normally do this\", even though we were ok'd by the girl who took our orders over the phone. Everyone treated us terribly as if we were being high maintenance, even though we were advised by the staff that this would be ok. We were not trying to make trouble for anyone, and were treated poorly because of the new girl's mistake. Not to mention she tried to close us out ahead of time, even though the bartender advised her that she should not \"close us out\"; to which she said \"I'm not closing them out, I'm having them pay for it.\" (Clearly she was brand new to the industry).  5 stars for food but the service at this location is terribleeeee! Such a shame.",

There was surprisingly no wait and we were able to get a patio table right away.  Our waiter took his dear sweet time getting to us, even though the place was pretty empty.  He didn't know what seasonal beers were on tap.  I'm a mad woman for lasagna and ordered the original classic flag lasagna with sausage; the sausage was so ground up it reminded me kind of like a pate.  The meal wasn't disgusting but I was incredibly underwhelmed, especially for a restaurant that prides itself on Italian food.   The portions are generous, but I don't particularly want a huge dish of subpar food.  I just think there is better out there.",

The think crust does take a while to come out, but if you decide to wait, it is very worth it. If you don't decide to wait however you're still in a for a delicious meal with their thin crust! They also have great lunch specials, I recommend the big rig pasta dish if you decide to go this route. Their side salads are the most generous portions I have ever experienced, and to top it all off you MUST order a Pizookie. This pizza cookie mix of a dessert will change your life and should definitely not be forgotten about when visiting Oreganos!",

Everytime we asked, they would raise the original time quote they gave us. The lady at the front was extremely rude when we tried to ask her how long it was still going to take, she would reply with an attitude or say that she wasn't able to tell us how long it was going to take. I had four extremely impatient children and more elderly people with me all of whom wanted to leave but we figured I'd we just waited ten more minutes, they would give us a table and that never happened. By the time we sat down and ordered, we were all so tired and over it. They sat down at least 5-10 parties who got there after us before even seating us. The ended up splitting us into two tables originally and then moving us together after another table got up. Ive been to Oregano's many times before and have never experienced such terrible service. Terrible is honestly an understatement for how bad this experience was.",

    "text": "My wife and i have eaten at several different Oregano locations in recent months, but we have been to the south Tempe venue the most, primarily due to other business that we have in that vicinity. I will say that regardless of the location, we have consistently received good service and excellent food at every visit, and Oregano's is quickly becoming one of our main staples for a good meal, and is now our number one choice for Italian cuisine.  The prices are also very affordable - especially if ordering from their lunch menu. Personally, my favorite is the Bollo pasta (bowl o' pasta), which includes a breadstick and free refills - all you can eat. (I usually select the angel hair pasta option - yummy!)  The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. This location in Tempe is rather quaint, as there is a seating area in the main building that faces University Dr, as well as a separate building in the rear of the property. Between the 2 buildings is a large patio area with outdoor seating. They also have a moderately sized bar in the main building with open seating available, so they have all of the bases covered to accommodate your seating preference. All in all, Oregano's really offers a comfortable environment and dining experience, across the board, and I do recommend paying them a visit!",

This time I gave a try for ziti and honestly it was good but not that great if you like your pasta saucy! This pasta is more dry due to baking it in the oven. I would go back to pizzas and bollo pasta. If you haven't tried oreganos I would highly suggest you to give a try and make sure to get pizza cookie :)",

Contacted this establishment and never heard anything back. 5 months later and here we are still waiting to make the issue right. I have since not been back to an oreganos in fear of this situation happening again.  Very slow. We were told the pizza would be a 45 minutes, and were waiting on food at least double that time. We were here so long that we could've preserved fossils from the flies on the windows. We also witnessed the second coming of Jesus and still haven't gotten our pizza. 1/10 service.",

Despite being a handful to eat, it was of solid quality and made for great leftovers (even if you split it you probably won't be able to finish it). I appreciate the waitstaff telling the customers how long these things take to bake. It's very courteous of them. I'll have to try more stuff off their menu, particularly their thin crust. Overall, if you're looking for a good, traditional American sit-down pizza place in Tempe, this is it!",

It's on the side of the building & is located outside. When we first got there we walked in the wrong door and got lost. We decided to sit inside. It's really small in there, feels kind of cramp to me.   I ordered the big rig & she ordered Alfredo the dark. HUGE portions for such a great price. I added 2 meatballs to my big rig. The pasta was really bland, nothing a little bit of salt couldn't fix. The meatballs didn't taste homemade. It felt like they were just frozen meatballs that they heated up. The Alfredo on the other hand was really good. It had a nice smokey flavor to it. But the toast that came with the Alfredo was so burnt. Why would you put burnt unedible toast on the plate? I didn't think it would be that hard to just retoast 2 new pieces of bread.   Service was really slow that night and it wasn't even busy. Drinks didn't get refilled. Took about 15 mins for our waiter to take our order after sitting down. Took 10 mins to get us To go boxes and get the bill. I wasn't too impressed with this place.",

Today I was going to order my usual ranch dressing for my salad. He suggested that I try the Italian dressing instead (and still brought me a side of ranch).

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm writing this review from a servers perspective. I also came into the restaurant 10 minutes before close. But nothing, not even staying after close, calls for the type of service my friends and I received.   Tonight I came into join some friends for a meal. First of all, when I got there, my friends who are also servers were already complaining. They did not get sat because it's restaurant policy to not seat until your whole party is there (sorry, my b) but sat at the bar to grab a beer. It took them 20 minutes to get a beer at the bar. 2. 0. I'm sorry, what? It's a Monday and it's not packed at all. That is absolutely unacceptable. It takes about 6 seconds for a 20 oz pour and 10 seconds to ring it in.   Then they finally got sat (I still wasn't there, so I don't know how) and ordered food. When I got there, it was 9:50, no one greeted me at the door (it happens) but I searched for my party and found them. I sat down and our server got to us about five minutes after. I ordered a beer (a Devils Ale) and surprisingly wasn't offered a menu, which I found to be odd. I mean, at this point I figured the kitchen was still open, as I was unaware that it should have been last call because no one had mentioned it to me. The server definitely didn't, and my friends would have told me if last call would have been done. If I had known, I wouldn't have ordered food. We had to actually ask our server when the restaurant closed. I'm sorry, but not giving customers a heads up about last call is extremely disrespectful to the folks in the kitchen, and I honestly feel bad for the people who work in the back. My apologies.  Another server came back with my beer and it was a Blue Moon. I didn't know if one of my friends had ordered another beer before I got there, or if this was supposed to be mine, but the bartender set it down in front of me and told me it was mine. I told them it wasn't and they took it back, but either the server rang it in wrong or the bartender poured it wrong. Not to mention, the server seemed in a huge rush to get out of there. Understandable, I get it, but don't make mistakes because you're a closer and you want to get out quickly.  Anyways, my friends got their food and I was still waiting (obviously because I had ordered after them). My friend had ordered two more beers, and the bartender dropped them off. She mentioned \"I hope it wasn't a 20 minute long wait for these beers!\" We know it was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't come off that way. It was a little awkward to say the least.  It wasn't a super long wait for food, but it was definitely a wait. When I got my food, it was good, but not great. Honestly, super mediocre Italian food. But that's the recipe and no one can really do too much about that. Not only that but when my food was dropped off, the server, in a rush, asked my friend if she could box up his food when he wasn't even halfway done with his salad. He didn't even have time to respond and she had already gotten the box.   After the meal, our server cleared our plates, but about five minutes later some girl came by to clear our beer glasses. She had her iPod headphones in (?) and was very sassy and pushy about getting our glasses from us. We were just like ooooohkay calm yo'self, here's the dang glass. No smiles, no nothing.   All in all, this one star is for the service, not the food. It was awkward and a lot was uncalled for. The food was okay, not the best, but the service could have been a lot better.",

Came here on a rainy night with 2 friends and had one friend who was on the fence of making it on time. Due to the rain the patio was shut down eliminating a lot of seating. I told the hostess there were 3 but maybe 4 of us and she said \"no problem you will get sat at a 4 top anyway.\" We went to the bar in the meantime and had a drink and when we came back outside realized pretty much everyone after us was already seated. Finally my friend said something and the hostess said she didn't seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet.  She must have felt the fire coming out of our eyes because we got sat right after that at a table that fits 8. Long story short - make sure you understand this alleged policy that I have never experienced at any of their other locations.  I was in a carb coma an hour later so all was fine.",

Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving good Italian grub!",

    "text": "Their deep dish pizza is simply to die for; if you don't order this, don't bother coming at all!!  Okay, that was a bit exaggerated. As an AZ raised/Chicago born diner I've been coming here for years, and in reality there are some kickass starters. For example, try the calamari and MMMMM cheesy garlic bread loaf. Honestly, I almost never eat any of the other entrees or pizza types anymore because my heart belongs to good old Chicago deep dish.  A lot of people don't order my type of pizza because they have to wait so long, but here's a pro tip: order your pizza about 20 mins before arriving at the restaurant. Yes, you can do that. This enables you to sit down and enjoy your meal without starving for a 50 minute wait or fighting off your hunger demons with appetizers.  I always order the Chicago style spinach pizza, and never do I come home without leftovers. Small girls like me can't consume more than two slices at a time, lol!",

Anywho the pizza was very tasty and the sauce is delicious!  I got a side of Soup (of course!) it was great.  The men: Well I informed the waitress this was their first time. And she gave a bit of info on the portion sizes but nothing when it came to the salads. So- Hubs got a Caesar salad. Pops got a house salad. One salad could feed 2 people. So we paid an extra ~$6 due to the size per person that are it.   So in conclusion- the pizza is amazing! It's nothing without the sauce so the sauce was great!  The serving size I would say are HUNGRY MAN status!   I took 2 star due to the waitress not telling us about the salad size, and our dirty dishes were stacked on the table yet no one came to pick them up!",

We got the golden wings and the barbecue chicken pizza as an appetizer (go big or go home, right?) and they were really delicious. I got the Stuffed Riga Tony and it was also really good. They even offer to sprinkle on EXTRA cheese on your meal, which is always a plus! Our waitress was really nice, though it seemed like she forgot about us several times. I never got a refill on my drink, which I thought was strange and something that should be automatic. The parking lot was also not capable of holding the amount of people there, but we parked across the street and it wasn't a huge deal. But even with those things, the food was so good, I wish I could go back today!",

Sullivan recommended a pasta plate for us to share, their famous and very delicious pizza and finish with their homemade cookie topped with vanilla ice cream.

They have a private dinner party room and an outdoor patio. The decor of the restaurant added to the vibe/Italian feel. It was a great experience.

This all changed a few weekends ago when my family decided to meet at this location for lunch. The menu had so many options I was torn on what to order between a pizza or a sandwich. I ended up ordering the Chicago Italian Sausage. It was huge, tasty, and easily was two meals on its own including the sides. I also must report that I loved their coleslaw which is odd because I have never liked coleslaw before. A few people at our table ordered salads and a pizza. The salads were huge and the pizza looked amazing. We had 10 people in our party total and the service was one the best I have ever experienced. Their food is amazing as well as their employees.

    "text": "This was my third visit to the Tempe location.  It's a short drive to Sky Harbor Airport, so I normally stop in after my flight arrives.  We had a group of 10 people on a Friday night.  We arrived at 6pm to avoid a long wait.  After 20 minutes, we were seated on the outdoor patio.  They have a few TVs and a bar area that keep you occupied while you wait.  The baseball playoffs were on, and the local team (Arizona Diamondbacks) were playing Milwaukee in a decisive game five to advance to the next round of the playoffs ... unfortunately, all the TVs were playing black and white reruns of \"The Honeymooners\" show from the 1950s.  Several other diners were wondering why the game wasn't on, but the staff didn't get the hint.  The Diamondbacks lost in extra innings.  Go Giants!  We started with the bruschetta and garlic bread.  They were both good, but the bruschetta was the better choice.  We had four kids in our group.  They wanted more bruschetta, but we still had pizza coming.  They have a good selection of beers (bottle and draft).  We went with draft since they were still at happy hour prices.  Next, we had a large serving of the Oregano's favorite salad.  It was enough for 6 adults.  The salad was crisp, and the honey vinaigrette dressing was sweet.  The pizza was outstanding!  The kids went with a 16\" thin crust.  Half cheese, and half hawaiian.  It was the perfect amount for four.  After the pizza was brought out, they sprinkled fresh cheese on top.  My son is a picky eater, but he loved the thin crust.  We also ordered a 12\" Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage (with pepperoncinis).  I normally prefer pepperoni or sausage, but the combination of the gorgonzola cheese and pepperoncinis was excellent.  The 12\" was just right for four adults.  Two of my friends didn't feel like pizza, so they went with pasta.  They ordered the El Diablo Shrimp pasta, and the garlic chicken lasagna.  The servings are huge ... probably double the size of a normal serving.  I would have asked them how the pasta was, but since they both finished their plates, I'm guessing it was good.  Again, these are HUGE servings.  This was my first time eating here with kids, so we had to try the pizza cookie for dessert.  Incredible.  Why didn't I order this before :)  The food was great, but the customer service was even better.  Our server (Melanie) was outstanding.  We never had to ask for anything because she was always one step ahead of us.  The bill including two rounds of drinks and tip was $200.  Great dinner at Oregano's.  We'll be  back!",

I'd rate it higher if I didn't have to withstand the aural and visual onslaught of Tempe visitors who can't be bothered to look anywhere else for a meal, and that's sad considering how much this town has to offer.  On occasions when coworkers insist on going, I do enjoy their salads.",

We ordered the deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza and they warned us that it would take 45 minutes.  Hey, fine with me.  So, to bide the time, we got cheesy bread.  This thing was about 2 feet long!  It came out in a bread basket, but was hanging over the ends.  That's how long it was.  Hey, I'm single.  I pay attention to length. There are a million different ingredients you can put on your pizza.  We had mushrooms (you can choose regular or portabella), onions (white, carmelized or red), green peppers and jalapenos.  It came out loaded with cheese and topped with sauce.  I like that.  It made the veggies and cheese all melted together and then topped with sauce.  I could only have one piece.   I didn't stay for the pazookie.  One of these days, I will.   The service was excellent.  We had a table outside (it had stopped raining) near the heaters.  The manager even gave me a blankie to put on my lap.",

Writing this review is much like jumping on the bandwagon, but perhaps you'll read my review and decide to go over for dinner.       When I go, I usually go earlier so that I can park in the restaurant lot. Otherwise, there is street parking available and you can get to within a block or two.       For years I have been coming here for the thin crust pizza. Order a size larger than you think you'll eat - the crust is so very thin that you can eat more of it before feeling full! This is a very fine thin crust - it will not disappoint you.        Over the years I have also sampled many of the pasta dishes. You''ll find them very good, and very generous - but I would recommend the pizza over the pasta.      Service is attentive, friendly, and swift - a lot of nice folks work here.       The pizza/cookie dessert is positively decadent!       Bottom line: excellent food, wonderful service, and worth the parking challenge.",

My favorites are the Pablo Picasso Salad, Big Beefstro Salad, cheese pizza, Guaca-Tony (a great spin on guacamole) and garlic bread with marinara. My husband loves the wings. The portions are always big enough to share. Trust me when I say this-share your meal and then you will have room for the Original Pizza Cookie! A family of 4 can share a pizza and an appetizer. Then finish with dessert. The prices are very reasonable. They have great kids meals too.  Sullivan at the bar is amazing. He really has his act together and it shows.

My favorite is the greek-style one, which they amp up with juicy sweet raisins which I initially thought sound really gross but in fact does work really well with the spicy feta and nutty roasted pine nuts. The lunch special of $3 for two really big slices of thin crust pizza is great too. The crust is really thin and perfect for folding, but thick enough to hold up a lot of cheese and a really good flavorful pizza sauce.   My only complain about Oregano's (all of them) is that the music is always way too loud. Like it's uncomfortable if you get the wrong seat under a speaker.",

They are always welcoming, and instantly greeted upon arrival by anyone who sees you.  The only thing that exceeds their great customer service, is their incredibly menu full of fantastic different options.  They offer a healthier pizza crust, which is a thin, whole wheat crust for those looking to indulge a little, but still stay on the healthier side.  They have enormous portions so sharing is a great option.  They feature a lunch special from 11-3 which is really a great deal, and great food.  Last but certainly not least is the Pazookie.  This is the most intensely satisfying and delicious part of Oregano's.  Everyone who eats there ABSOLUTELY needs to order this... it is out of this world!",

The parking lot is not big enough to accommodate all of the people who want to park there. I parked a few blocks east at a strip mall. Ordered the stuffed numero-oneo. It was a 12 inch pie that easily fed 3 with leftovers and I can put down some pizza. It was the best pizza I have had in years. Highly recommended.   The wait for this pizza was over and hour. I would see if you can call ahead or order in line. We also has the bruschetta appetizer that was pretty good.",

I am grateful alone that I live in a city that has such a ridiculously wonderful and unique specialty that no other place has (that i know of)! Their pizzookies are a great alternative other than drinking if you were in a breakup, a boy passed you up (yes i'll eat my feelings if need be, and that's if a brown bag special passed me up), you failed a test, or had a shitty day.  I love that their pizzookies are either choco chip white macadamia nut or oatmeal raisin. you can do half and half too! and served with two scoops of ice creams makes this an awesome snack or after dinner treat.

Standout toppings were the delicious sauce, real Italian sausage, and Wisconsin cheese!!!!  And the crust OMG, perfectly thin and slightly burnt edges MELT in your mouth! Service was excellent, small place vibe with outdoor searing....can't forget I loved my prickly pear Margarita.   Well two of me to be honest. This place is the real Chicago pizza deal.....soo tired of all the pretenders! Will definitely be back!",

Look no further than Oregano's Bollo Pasta (Bowl-O-Pasta) special any day of the week - about $7 for unlimited spaghetti...yes please! (They'll even pack up a cute serving To Go for you on your way out.) Craving anything else? Yes, it's probably on the menu.   Service is friendly, and the manager checked in on us multiple times, too! Sat outside on the patio - a little warm, but it might have just been the piping hot food we were served.   $5 cheesecake or pizza cookie to finish off your meal is always a must, too.   The only so-so part of eating at this Mill location is the limited parking. You may have to hover/circle for a few minutes until a spot opens up if it's busy. Not a deal breaker! Thank you Oregano's! Legalize Marinara!",

    "text": "I honestly have never understood the Oregano's hype. There is always an ungodly wait, it's packed (because the locations are tiny) and the food is average.  We attended a dinner with 12 friends and called a week in advance about reservations. Of course, they don't take them but said if we used Yelp, we could jump in line virtually ahead of time. Being familiar with places that utilize the 'No Wait' app, this seemed simple enough.   An hour before we wanted to eat, I attempted to pt our party in, however for parties of more than 7, it said to call the restaurant. So I did. The restaurant said there was nothing they could do, just to put it in as 6 people and notate that it was 12 people for 7 pm. So we did and called the restaurant to confirm as we received a text that our table would be ready in 20 minutes. The host was very confused but ended up locating the note. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated at 7:20 due to a large party who wasn't getting up after their meal. This just seemed like a lot of hoop jumping. Just take a reservation for large parties, make it easier for everyone.   Food was average, we ordered a salad and pasta. The prices are supported somewhat by the large portions but not the quality or taste in my opinion.",

I really liked the look of their stuffed pizza but True CHI deep-dish takes 45 to 60 minutes so we ordered some veggie skillets and a bruschetta and some beer and wine  to nibble on while we waited. OMG the bruschetta was great, and we had a real Italiano in our party of 5. Large slices of grilled Italian bread fresh and just the right amount of crunch, and the topping was as delicious as it was volumous! If you like garlic, get the bruschetta. Finally the pizza came and it was like mama's lasagna on a crust, amazing! Loads of cheese and the selected toppings in Each bite. It is heavy and we only ate half, but I took that pie back to Cali and ate it for 3 more days... Mmmmm GREAT Job Oreganos",

There were flies buzzing around our heads the entire meal and a dying fly was on our table when we arrived.  Makes you wonder about the cleanliness of the establishment ie one fly can sneak in an open door but multiple flies are concerning. The server did not bring my toddler the play dough until we asked specifically for it.  We had to ask for water refills, they were not automatically provided & keep in mind it was not busy.  Extremely unattentive waiter.  Pizookie was overcooked and literally stuck to the pan. I have been coming to oreganos for years and this has got to be the worst experience so far and very disappointing.  I will not be frequenting this location again.",

Although it's a Monday night, the place was packed and I found the one empty barstool to have a drink and place my to-go order. Saw a group of people order this frozen delicious looking drink, so I did the same. It ended up being the Gibbilini Bellini and it was tasty. I decided to order the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta and then proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait some more. I saw a to-go order come out and get sat on the counter, but was told mine would be a few more minutes. Fast forward to a few more minutes and guess what? That one was mine.  Now for the pros and cons of the dish. The shrimp was huge and looked amazing, but ended up being overcooked and chewy. Overall, it was SPICY. The menu says it has a \"kick\". Yeah, that's putting it mildly. It's been ten minutes since I finished eating and my mouth still feels like it's on fire. I'm convinced they took jalapeno and rubbed it on every single piece of pasta before they gave it to me! Other than that, the garlic bread was buttery and toasted just the right amount.  I'm inclined to try it again while I'm here, especially with the amount of people that were there. Next time when I read \"kick\", I'll stay away though!",

So disappointed but she knew what she did because she never came back to the table. We told the food runner it was wrong but we didn't have time to wait.

    "text": "Tempe on University Oregano's used to be our favorite place in the world!  We looked forward to going to it, meeting some of the regular employees, and meeting some guests at the bar while enjoying some of our favorite food.  We have known some staff since this location opened.  We'd been with this location for almost twenty years.   But the last visit, about a week and a half ago was so terrible, so poor with the female manager \"G...\" and female bartender that we are looking for a new favorite location.  Both employees tried to provoke by being very nasty and confrontational and neither could get over the fact we made a mistake and sat in one of the few high top tables that are between the bar and the window (used to be open seating). From about fifteen feet away Manager G blared out at us, as if the evening was an Amazing Race Contest, we we had done a dine and dash, or were bad kids that had gotten three previous warnings, that we needed to get up immediately as she was the manager. How embarrassing... several tables heard it, one table later told us, they had noticed it was a \"bad day\" for the staff.  Anyway, It was odd, we just sat down someplace that others sat for forty five minutes while they awaited for a table.  We had enjoyed conversations with those people their home area of an Diego and wait staff asked them several times what they wanted and they said they were just waiting for a table and sitting at the high top.  Thus, we had no idea, since we had sat there before, and these people had sat there for 45 minutes that we had done an unforgivable act.  Seating was a disaster, a crowd from baseball, although three people patrolled the hostess stand they were obviously overwhelmed and and I say patrolled because they seemed to hate their jobs that night.  When we finally got to sit down at the bar, at legal open seating we ordered wings. The first thing out of the bartender's mouth was \"I know my  manager and you didn't get along\".  We  replied, we didn't know the four high top tables were now seating only by a host or hostess--I wasn't done with my comment but the bartender interrupted me and said very sharply \"the high top tables have never been open seating (incorrect). Regardless, we let that go and the bartender then finally hurled menu's at us.  We had to request water.  We had to request eating utensils.  We ordered wings, and they came out about forty minutes later, cold to the touch. Someone seating near us had noticed the rudeness of the female \"G\" manager and bartender particularly to us and she touched one of the wings--and said these aren't even warm. This resulted in another glare from the bartender, who took the wings without any comment, glared at us, and about twenty minutes later brought us hot wings dropping them on the counter so fast the dressing container almost fell out.  The people beside us again made note and asked if this place was always like that.  I said no, it is our favorite place.  Soon after the female manager made several deliberate attempts to wait on people around us behind the bar, which was odd since she had been so overwhelmed with two others the three running the hostess/host station.  The female manager G would laugh and giggle and loudly talk to others immediately on either side of us, including those seating beside us who were annoyed at the manager and bartender's attitude towards us.  We continued to be ignored, as were our  empty drinking glasses except for glares. The manager came out to apparently confront us and get sympathy, saying she had experienced a very bad day,horrible day.  Then said she had a death to deal with, and \"was just having a difficult day\". I politely told her maybe she should take a break and go home which resulted in her storming off.  We were able to interrupt the bartender to order a pizza and ask for refills of our drinks. Again people around us noticed the rudeness directed at us, apparently for, our earlier unfortunate mistake of seating in a high top seat that used to be open seating years ago.  Not one time during the night were we offered service, asked how our replacement wings were, asked how our pizza was, nor did they ever offer to refill our drinks.  Our bill came.  he female manager made one last round to glare at us.  We paid our bill, and set talking to people about three minutes, that we had just met about things to do with the area.  The bartender taking the bill confronted my friend asking if her service was poor because there was not tip. We hadn't left yet, but decided at that time to revoke any cash we had planned to leave (as it certainly wasn't deserved-but was certainly expected).  We did call, and receive a call from corporate, with an open ear and apology.  That said, we miss you already Oregano's on University. We went from recommending you weekly, if not monthly, four months a year when in AZ to strongly not recommending.  If staff is having that bad of a day they should stay in the back or go home.",

It is a warm and gooey chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, good for a group. The best dessert I've ever had for sure!",

We figured that was fine b/c we could keep the kids entertained for that long. It wasn't 20. It was 40. As we were shown to our table, I slipped on the floor (it was COVERED in dirt, oil, old food) as I'm carrying my 5 month old and almost fell. Thankfully my husband was there for me to hold onto! It took a while before we got our food which again, would have been fine if we didn't have a 2.5 year old and 5 month old. The long wait ruined it for me and the leftover pizza was gross the next day. I might try it again without our kids but with little ones, this is definitely not a place to go.",

Nothing special to say about the appetizer. The pizza came sliced into squares, but what I noticed first was how thin the crust was! Even better, when I took my first slice, was that the crust was not soggy. The Numero One-o was their traditional combo of toppings. I really loved this pizza and would come back.",

Think an Italian-style Chili's, take out the Italian, substitute Chicago-style crust and small novel inventions in obese-size portions and you'll arrive at Oregano's.   I've been twice and both times I was unimpressed. The food was mostly  a sad melding of American-Italian food, introducing the worst parts of both. The sandwich I had was drowned in tomato sauce and even the salads were gigantor.   The decor reminds me of an Applebee's -- and most certainly not in a good way.

That's probably the least favorite part about Oregano's is how busy it tends to get during the lunch and dinner hours.  My word of advice is get their just a little earlier to beat the rush.  To the actual review: Oregano's has always been a favorite of mine, ever since I lived on ASU's campus.  I probably ate there two to three times a week.  Man I loved it!  Now that I've graduated I've had time to try other things, and my affection for the place has definitely started to diminish as their are finer things in life than Oregano's.  Now that they are adding more locations it seems to be a lot more convenient (especially the Ocotillo location), but the trade off is the food has been watered down a bit.  Trust me, I know.  It still is a great place to hang out with friends, and if your looking to share your food with someone, cause the portions are HUGE!  It just seems like Oregano's is the trendy place to hangout cause everyone is doing it, but trust me....there are finer things in life than Oregano's!  Last, I know that everyone always raves about how great their pizza is, but honestly I've definitely had better pizza in the valley ie: Cibo, Pizzeria Biancho, or La Grande Orange (Check out my reviews).    Here are my favorites items on the menu:  -Meatball Sandwich -Big Kahuna Tuna Sandwich (no longer available....RIP) -Zany Ziti Pasta -Italian Gold Wings -Pablo Picasso Salad -Guaca-Tony -Pesto Bruschetta -Pizza Cookie",

Always tried to talk the co-workers into heading here if I could pull it off since Tempe is off the beaten path for those of us in Ahwatukee.    The cheese bread is addictive and huge.  If there's any room left, go for the Italian Wedding Soup if it's in season.  I'd go back just for that soup.  The broth is flavorful and it has a huge wonderful meatball in it with a dash of tomato sauce.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the pizza list.  We've only tried the thin crust but everything on the menu was top notch in terms of ingredients and flavor.  No complaints at all.  The service is friendly and the ambience of this place is casual  but lively and fun, too.  If you're going at lunch time, be prepared to wait.  It gets pretty crowded.",

    "text": "I hated it. We ate there before going to Gammage to see a play and we were seated in a strange addition in the back corner.  I noticed a smell, like rotting food, but it was faint and I ignored it. The food was not great. I think the smell was bothering me and ruining my appetite. The cheesy bread had too much garlic and too much cheese, if that's possible. My husband didn't notice that grease was dripping down his face while eating it. That's too much.   Then, a COCKROACH crawled by on the wall right by our table, at eye level. We were horrified. We called the manager over and informed him, and he apologized and told us it had NEVER happened before, which I find hard to believe since roaches don't exactly lead solitary lives, and said he would \"do something\" to make it up to us.   He didn't.  Not that it would have really mattered (I won't be back), but if you are manager and you tell a customer you will do something , well then you do it.",

    "text": "Our family loves oreganos! Their salads are sooo good and the pizza is to die for! My 2 favorite go to's are:   Alfredo the Dark pasta with chicken - Creamy and spicy alfredo sauce with big curly noodles, and a nice fire roasted chili on top.   Thin crust cheese pizza - Add some freshly grated parm and the red chili oil from the condiment tray on the table... so simple, but damn is it amazing!   But the most amazing thing ON THIS PLANET is the pizzookie.. when you get that first bite of warm gooey cookies, and cold creamy ice cream, you will think you died and gone to heaven. And it's free on your birthday!!!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hit or miss with the services. 1/2 the time the waiter/waitress is amazing and totally on their game. The other 1/2 of the time we would wait 30 minute for our check, 20 minutes for refills, ask repeatedly for condiments or utesils. But being right across the street from ASU i bet the turn around there is crazy. And the parking lot it tiny, there have been a few times we circled and circled for 10 minutes and never found a spot and were forced to eat somewhere else.  All in all, amazing food at decent prices :) Highly recommend for families or friendly get togethers.",

If you order them \"hot\", then that is exactly what they turn out being. HOT. Not \"hooters\" hot, but actually, mouth-numbing, HOT. Capital letters. You will be the mayor of hiccupville. Better order another 24 oz beer.   The rest of the food i have tried here was also delicious. The Big O'l Ravioli, is literally a single ravioli, that is the size of an airplane pillow. What's not to like about that? Also the pizza cookie TRUMPS the one they serve at BJ's. I wholeheartedly recommend it Oregano's. I also wholeheartedly recommend that Oregano's open a restaurant in San Diego. Please and thank you.",

He made me a jalapeno margarita, which is not on the menu, and kept spicing it up to my satisfaction...better experience than we could have asked for!  Sullivan is THE MAN!

The thin crust pizza is great to share. The staff is always attentive and super friendly. Other reasons include: The Pazooki - Vanilla ice cream a-top a huge steaming hot cookie. Belinnis - Frozen Peach schnapps, champagne, and chambord. Great atmosphere - old records and signs, oversized tables, frank sinatra playing overhead. A great patio with heaters in the winter and misters in the summer. Just don't go on a night you are super starving, because there is ALWAYS a wait at any of their locations and they don't take reservations!",

Staff were EXTREMELY friendly (almost over the top), but the service was absolutely terrible. We didn't order any of the complicated and long preparation time items and it took nearly 35 minutes to get our food -- and the restaurant was barely 70% full.   I got the baked pesto ziti with chicken. It was all right, nothing to write home about. Would be great for pesto lovers as its drenched in it. The redeeming factor was that the grilled chicken addon gives you A LOT of chicken breast for your 3 bucks. The bread bowl was also a little disconcerting  They forgot to input my coworkers order (slice of pepperoni pizza) into the computer and it took an extra 10 minutes after the rest of us got our food to prepare that. Seriously? 10 minutes for 1 slice of the most common pizza ever served?! Other coworker got the Big Rig Rigatoni and she said it was pretty good. Definitely looked better than my dish.  Overall this reminded me of the typical American chain-ish restaurant with the HUGE portions. Staff were superfriendly but that doesn't make up for a disorganized kitchen",

When I moved down to Phoenix in '05 I was disappointed to find very little in the way of tasty Italian fare, so  I was excited the first time I went to Oregano's because I had heard so many rave reviews for it.    What I have come to realize is that Oregano's is the \"nice restaurant\" for the Mill Ave. area.  More likely than not, this is where everyone who goes to ASU wants to eat on their birthday.  Chances are this is the nicest place they've eaten because they A) don't have a car or B) refuse to leave their Mill-box.    I'm not saying don't go, just don't expect to be blown away.  If you don't mind driving for better food, I'd check out Rigatony's in Chandler.",

Also my last trip there which was a few days ago, I had the pleasure of starring at some dudes ass crack who was sitting in front of me at the bar.  Not Oregano's fault.  But still there was some middle aged wanna be hipster with 1980's grunge greasy long hair. Anyway on to the food.  Lately I have been ordering the Pablo Picasso Hispanic Orientated salad.  I have been dieting, a little on the \"fat\" side lately. Sometimes I get two bear claws wedged right in this spot.  After some research I found without the dressing and corn chips it is not to bad on the calorie intake.  Also the flavor really is excellent, the chicken is super well done.  It is fajita style but maybe better.  Also note to one bartender stop charging me for soda water with a small amount of lemonade and I will tip much better.   Oregano's I will see you soon.",

If you order spaghetti, you get a ton of noodles with a little bit of marinara that is way overwhelmed by the taste of oregano. If you order lasagna, expect it to be dry and tough. Even with a knife I had a challenge eating it. I go an extra half mile to the drug store and get a frozen Stouffer's for 1/4 the price and way more delicious. You know how left over pasta in the fridge gets? The pasta soaks up all the moisture and it gets dry and tough? Well, that's what they serve here. I don't order pizza because I can't stand their over oreganoed marinara sauce, so there seems no sense in trying it.",

You can't get two seperate flavors in one order of wings (which kind of bummed me out), but you can get the sauces mixed together. So the waiter suggested the Wong sauce mixed with the Medium sauce...holy cow! So so so so yummy! And I tell you what, that medium sauce has a hell of a kick. I was sweating by the time I got through my 5th wing. I'm kinda afraid to try the Hot sauce.  I've also tried their Meatball sandwich. I got the Junior size and still couldn't finish the thing! I also got the side Chicken Ceaser Pasta salad which was tres delicious.  You can also get giant stuffed pizzas which I hear are amazing, but they take about 40 minutes to get to your table which gives you plenty of time to fill up on beer. Which brings me to my biggest piece of advice if you plan on eating at Oregano's: wear loose fitting pants.  The location on University is always pretty busy, parking can be a bit messy and they won't seat you until your entire party is there. So I recommend carpooling.",

    "text": "I love Oregano's! I especially love this location! The outside patio on a beautiful day is worth the wait. And waiting is something you should anticipate because this place gets packed! So if you want to eat early then get there before 7 and if not be ready to wait at least half an hour to an hour give or take ten minutes. Then remember that your meal will take about 20 to 30 minutes to come out depending on what you order but don't worry about all of that, just go and get a drink and sit and relax with friends and family.   As for food I usually always stick with pizza and wings. I recommend the medium and gold flavored wings. Gold isn't on the menu but just tell your server and they'll know what you mean. They are so delicious, honestly one of my favorite wing sauce of all times.   As for pizza, Oh my god, there are so many great choices. If you want something different and want to try their chicago style pizza then I recommend the Numero One-0. If you like pan pizza try the Lawrence's Chicken Cheddar Broccoli. And if you like thin crust pizza's, which honestly I love, then try the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato. The Grandma G's is my absolute favorite pizza at Oregano's, but don't take my word for it go and try them all out for yourself.   Oh and I almost forgot, if you still have room left for dessert make sure to get the pizza cookie! That thing is so good, I just wish I didn't get full every time I go so I could actually order one.",

So when my friends and I came here for a late night dessert visit, we each got our own pizza cookie.  I had them before, but this visit was heavenly.  The experience was the very definition of foodgasm.  So when I returned to Tempe for the first time since I left in 2007, I knew I had to go back to Oregano's.  Fortunately everything was just as I remembered.  Huge sandwiches including my entree, the veggie wedgie.  It was a little underseasoned but the aioli helped it a lot.  The pizza cookie was just as good as every.  Nice and hot.  Simple concept and yes, I could make it at home, but why when they make it for you.",

The parking situation could be improved and the place gets crowded fast (a sign of a good establishment) , so try to get there right at 11:00 when they open if you are planning a lunch. Dinner time? Fuggedaboutit!  You will have a wait...  The pizza is always a good option. The slices are huge and one will typically fill up even a big guy like me. Maybe add a small salad if you must. I also enjoy the Big Rig Pasta. Lately I have been trying to be less of a big guy and instead, have ordered the salad. I have never attempted a full size and typically can only come close to finishing the half portion. The Pablo Picaso Mexican Salad is good, as is Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad - but my favorite is the Vino Bambino.  Hint - don't eat it all! Save room for dessert because there are fewer things on Earth I have experienced that are better than the Original Pizza Cookie. YUMMY! It's best not to be in a hurry because the cookie takes about 15 minutes to prepare - but its well worth the wait!",

    "text": "Stopped by for dinner after going to the Phoenix Zoo.  This was a great find!  We had two large thin crust pizzas and orders of bbq and hot wings.  The pizza crust was the thinnest I've ever had and it was wonderfully crispy.  The toppings were great and fresh parmesan tossed over the pizza after it was served to the table made it perfect.  The hot wings were some of the best I've ever tasted.  Outdoor seating in the courtyard was neat with overhead heaters, but we had a party of 10.  Long wait for outdoor seating made us decide on an inside seating.  It was still great, although I think the outdoor seating would have been even better.  They don't take call in reservations, by the way.  Great service, great food.  We'll go back again for sure.",

She served us with a bubbly personality and even happened to be same major my daughter was considering, and gave us feedback in that arena.  Jocelyn also recommended visiting Mesa before heading back to S.A..  great experience at Oregano's!",

After an evening event at ASU, we were in need for some serious food, and look what we found.  The environment wad friendly and open. Menu wad extensive and expansive (And I think the menu might make ones waist expansive as well!)!!!  The staff, hostess, waitress, and everyone else we encountered were friendly and professional.  Bright and clean room and the overall volume was not bad for a Friday night!  Our food arrived quickly and was every bit a good as we had expected!    Be prepared to take food home. Do not worry if there is a wait!!! It is worth the wait, and they do an awesome job of trying to accommodate you even while waiting!!!  The pizza tastes were a great tease for the real thing!  I highly recommend this establishment for groups of any size... Be ready to eat dinner awesome food and have an excellent time!!!",

    "text": "After getting a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop in downtown Phoenix, my friend and I decided to visit a friend in tempe and got hungry on the way there so we all decided to grab pizza and someone suggested the oreganos on university Dr. So we went ahead and arrived and asked for a table at 7:05pm and were told there was a 25-30 mins wait but we didn't mind because there was a cool little thrift store 5 mins away so we went ahead and left. At 7:25 we got a txt saying our table was ready and got seated by 7:30ish, we didn't place our food order until 7:40pm and waited a very long time for our food to arrive, it wasn't packed or anything. At 8:55 we finally got our food! We were just praying it was the best goddang pasta in the world because we did wait an hour and 15 mins to arrive, we were joking and laughing and just having a good time catching up time went by fast. I ordered the bollo pasta and I couldn't eat more than 2 bites because it felt like I was chewing on rosemary,I asked the waiter to please exchange my food for something else and asked for the pizza cookie which by the way was really good but also took 25 mins to arrive at the table, bummer!! And lets not even mention the Anita Margarita  was just plain gross. We left at around 9:50-10pm and we dropped off our friend and 45 mins later he texted me saying he had gotten food poisoning and so did my other friend and I. So I don't know how exactly they prep their good but there was something in it that made us all sick. I'd recommend oreganos but definitely NOT this location. The service was poor and the food didn't taste like it was cooked right and on top of it, we all got food poisoning, I had to pull over to the side of the freeway to vomit the two bites of pasta I had for dinner and the pizza cookie I shared with my two other friends.",

The garlic bread was a soggy, garlic butter soaked mess which needed to be put under my broiler before eating. At about 2:00 am I woke up and the worst explosive diarrhea  ever!! I suspect the garlic bread, as I have had the meatballs & sausage before, and they were fine. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my food even though I got there 25 minutes after I phoned in the order, and was told 20 to 30 minutes on the phone. The girl who took care of me was high or something. She didn't have a nickel to make correct change, as I paid cash. And while I was waiting she put someone else's bill and credit card in front of me and asked me to sign it. WTF???",

Sa I don't it was a we minute wait for indoor seating, so we come to see in the patio area. But when our hostess came back with to seat us, she told us there were seats with the high chairs/tables. Whew!!! It would have been a scorcher sitting in the sun. The umbrellas were of no use with the sun setting 'cause the umbrella stand doesn't bend. We had the 18\" Clark Meat Pizza on a thin crust and a big Julius salad which is served nice and cold along with cold plates. The salad was fresh and crisp;  the pizza with just the right amount of meat came out hot and full of flavor. Matt was our server who doubled as a bartender and was helpful and personable along with the other staff. In the future.we wouldn't mind coming later for dinner, but I don't know if I could wait an hour to be seated. There was ample parking on the side and back of the building as hen we left at 6:30 PM.",

Although their prices have gone up slightly, it is still worth the waits that often occur at most of their locations.  Their Chicago deep dish or thin crusts are gigantic; and it's nice you can do half and half.  Pasta and salads are excellent especially their Beefsteak salad.   While sometimes their pizzas maybe a little salty, I ask the wait staff to tone it down. No wonder Arizona is now the pizza capital in the US; it's because of creative pizza made here.   The environment is entertaining with past memorability; the food looks as beautiful as the staff and the customers all for a great price.",

The service was prompt and the whole staff in general was hard working and successfully attended each customer.  I ordered the Bollo Pasta which was an affordable option for an \"all you can eat\" dish. Hallee was also extremely helpful in constructing the dish to be exactly how I wanted, informing me of the varying sauces and pastas they had. As a whole, the garlic bread, pasta, and pizza cookie were delicious and I enjoyed it all!

I called in my order since my husband was in the area and I'm home getting kids to sleep. Someone named Diva answered and was very friendly in taking my order. She got my phone number and my husbands name since he was picking it up. Then I called my husband and told him order was in. He was there 15 minutes later, a little earlier than the wait time we were given. He spoke to Diva, who took my order on the phone. Only, she didn't have the order? It was lost? She acted clueless to me having placed an order. Asked if it was placed at the correct location (obviously it wasn't, Diva) and couldn't find it... My husband had to order all over again, but that also meant waiting 30 extra minutes when the point of calling in was that it would be close to ready upon arrival! Very annoying. There was no apology or effort made to make up for this mistake. My husband already had a long day and didn't want to sit and wait for our order for 30 minutes due to their mistake.   Foods alright. It tastes a lot better when you are able to eat it in a good mood. The paradise valley location is better. I've had many meals ordered to go there that weren't lost either.",

Waited over 40 minutes before meal arrived & I wasn't asked for a refill while the server filled a neighboring regulars drink & even my husbands before asking me if I'd like a refill CRAZY right? I'm currently trying to decide if I should use my invisibility for good or evil... There were only 3 of us at the bar & a few tables in the bar she was responsible for so NO reason for the miss. The meatballs were taken off our meal which literally was the least that could've happened. I hate to have such a negative review of one my fave local restaurants. I'm at the Goodyear location regularly &   it. This location unfortunately didn't meet my basic needs as a diner. When questioned about the length of time I was met with a less than empathetic we're down a chef tonight. I replied with there were plenty of take outs happening next to me at the register & pizzas at the table seated after us. She shrugged her shoulders & said she was sorry with an attitude. Then began slamming cups on the counter. Made the rest of the meal uncomfortable. Worst experience at Oregano's for us. The 2 stars are for the delicious food & Bellini.",

Again, another sign of greatness.  Every year I make a stop here while in AZ for Spring Training.  It's well worth the wait.  Went here on a Friday night around 5pm. I checked in on yelp and saved myself 20 minutes.   The food is excellent. I try something new each year. The portions are large, shareable sizes.  They used to have a pizza that was spinach and broccoli that was amazing, and they still make it for me when I order it every year to take back to CA.  The servers all seems to be local college students with upbeat personalities.  My only complaints are the bar area idea needs to be rethought.  There are bar tables in the bar area that they use for serving tables. It's strange because some people think they are empty tables and sit there only to be kicked off them.  If you are sitting there eating (at these tiny tables), you have people elbowing you from the bar and can't order a pizza because there's no room.",

The meal started out well with some solid artichoke dip but the thin crust pizza had me realizing that there is such a thing as too much Italian seasoning on a pizza. Once I said that out loud, I realized that the name of the place is Oregano's but the seasoning of the sauce was way too much and easily the most I've ever tasted on a pizza. Perhaps if I had ordered some meat on the pizza it would balance out the flavor, but a simple thin crust cheese pizza was unenjoyable due to the overwhelming taste of Italian seasoning. Service was okay and overall I don't think I'll be going back.",

We waited for first available and then changed to splitting the party into two 4-tops in order to be seated at 5:10, given a 6:00 departure time for an event (that we shared with the hostess). We had a server indicate she would be working our tables and would be back \"in a moment\".   5 mins later an no sign of our server, so I went to the hostess to indicate we were going to leave, as we had yet to even have someone take our order, for which I received a question if I wanted to speak with the manager?  At this point, I confirmed that we were leaving (as what is the manager going to do but further delay us leaving to find other food?) and told her, frustrated, that they should be properly staffed on a night like this (as many come before Gammage shows for dinner).  We usually have great service and food at other Oreganos, but we ended up driving down the street to another pizza place where the service was far better tonight. We understand it's a smaller location, but that should have no bearing on the short staffing or poor table management seen tonight.",

I warn people ahead of time how long their deep dish takes .

They update the menu's with different items from time to time, so they keep on giving you a reason to come back. Very smart.   I've never had a bad meal here, and I've gone A LOT. Something that can only be conveyed in ALL CAPS. :) The portions are big, especially if you order their big salad size. I'm partial to the \"Pablo Picasso\" salad. For a little over $10, you get a sizable portion that is hard to finish in one sitting. The \"Oregano's Favorite\" and \"Vino Bambino\" are delicious, and with so many choices, you can satisfy your tastebuds , almost as much as with a pizza, but with something not known for being characteristically satiating.  I would be remiss to not mention the pizza. I've had their thin crust, and I have had their deep dish Chicago Style, and they are all excellent. You can expect this excellence each time you visit. I'm sure everyone has their preference on pizza, but there is a reason this place isn't a delivery oriented grease box. Its on the more opposite end of the spectrum along with other quality pizza purveyors.",

    "text": "I asked our hotel who had the best Italian food in Tempe - they told me Oreganos.  I immediately followed with researching Yelp reviews.  I was a little uneasy about some of the more recent reviews I had seen so I called the restaurant to inquire.  I spoke with Ashley who just happened to be the GM.  Ashley gave me the perfect answer - they DO take Yelp reviews very seriously and actively train their employees based on what they find out on Yelp.  I decided to take my son and my best friend to try it out.  We arrived to see a significant amount of people waiting outside to be seated. After a short conversation, we parked and put our name in.  The hostess quoted us about 45 minutes.  During our wait, we were pleasantly surprised to see a plate of pizza brought out to satisfy those hungry souls that decided to wait. Waiting with some pizza in your hand is much easier than waiting with NADA.  Good Idea!!! Once we were seated, we went through the menu and had a tough time deciding on what to eat.  They have so many enticing choices.  Since we had the pizza prior to being sat, we knew that was EPIC.  We went with the Julius Caesar Salad and 2 pizzas - one cheese and one BBQ chicken.  The salad came out first.  What would Julius Caesar have said if his life was not cut short that fateful day in March?  He would have said....yeeeaaaahhhh booooooyyyyyyyy - this salad ROCKS. Next was the PIE.  Oh man -  thin crust, right amount of topping, good amount of cheese, perfectly cooked - this was a good pie!  Overall, we had an amazing experience at Oreganos.  The food, the staff, the atmosphere, all top-notch.  Ashleys experience and personality also resonated with us - she seemed to always be looking out for the guests and was VERY personable (not to mention, easy on the eyes, too).  If you are in Tempe and want some delicious Italian food - this is the PLACE.  And, you get a fortune cookie afterwards....pretty cool. Say HI to Ashley, too - you will know what I mean:)",

Throughout my four years at ASU, I think I ate Oregano's over 50 times.. Whether it was take-out or dining in, I was always satisfied with the food. They mess up orders sometimes, but they are so friendly and accomodating, they will reimburse you, re-make the food or give you a free pizza cookie.   I highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread with marinara sauce and bruschetta for appetizers. For the rest of the menu, I think I've tried most of it.. But if you are a pasta person.. the Big Rig, Zany Ziti, The Lady is a Scampi and Alfredo the Dark are my favorites.. Pretty much the whole menu is delicious! I got the wings once and they were good, but I wouldn't order them if there's a whole bunch of other good stuff to order.   Oregano's is really accomodating and will make any substitutions! I always got the Big Rig with the medium sauce they put in their wings and it was delicious.. or for me it was because I love spicy food! The only downfall is that over the years, I noticed the portions got smaller.. but that's just me being greedy about food! Don't forget to order the pizza cookie.. you can get 2 different choices of cookies if you want variety! Overall, I love Oregano's and I can't wait to eat there again!",

This restaurant doesn't know what real pizza is. Holy cow! We put everything we could imagine on top of it to make it taste like something. We tried adding salt ,we tried oregano ,we tried crushed hot pepper. The salt helped a little bit.Never mind the half hour wait just to be seated and then another one hour to wait for the not so hot from the oven pizza to be delivered to our table. They were kind enough to comp us for the pizza. I would not go back again.",

First time I had the bread sticks and Pizza, very VERY delicious! Second time I tried a sandwich, much to my pleasure. No regrets so far, very wonderful, I would recommend this place again and again.   However! Word to the wise, long wait!! I don't mean 10 or 15 minutes, sometimes it can be 45 minutes to get a table, not even kidding. However, it's very worth the wait and even with that information, I still recommend this place.",

Usually when we go, we get a 16\" pie with a few toppings.  3-4 people can easily polish one these off.  Lately though we've tried their calzone, and damn is that thing big.  Filled inside with tons of great ingredients, comes out piping hot and a taste that will last for a life time.  If you still have room for dessert, I highly recommend their pizza cookie. Once you eat that, there's no going back.  You'll drown yourself in a chocolate paradise.  I love this place!  The ONLY draw back (but still gave it 5 stars) is that if you dont get their early, get ready to wait for at least 30-40 minutes to be seated.",

Wish we ordered 14 instead of 9!    I ordered the Italian Stuffed sandwich.  Loved it.  Couldn't finish it and brought half home.  My wife got a pizza and ate the whole thing herself.  Just kidding.

We did the call ahead on Yelp and arrived within the time frame. The place seemed really slow, so they led us right in to sit. My first problem of the afternoon is they led us to a back shack looking thing that had no AC, flies were everywhere and well.... It had NO AC! It honestly looks like MR. Oregano walked in and said \"we don't need this storage area, in order to make more money lets empty this shack out and sit idiots in here\"... I had to suck it in in order to get into my booth. Now, anyone who knows me knows im a big dude as in weightlifting... Not overweight.... As I sat uncomfortably the chipper waiter walked up and asked what he can get us for drinks. Before anyone could say anything, I asked him if he can get us a table in the main dining area, where they have AC, no flies, and im not feeling like im in a old storage facility. He walked off annoyed saying he would check... Came back a min later and said they were completely full in there, and what could he get us to drink... I didn't let it go, I asked him how it was slammed if the parking lot was dead. At this point my wife reeled me in and I just dropped it. I asked for a water with lemon and a Dos Equis with 2 limes... At this point im annoyed, sweaty, swapping flies, and wanting to order to go to sit in the car and eat. The waiter brings us our waters and my beer, drops it off and takes, he didn't even wait for me to tell him my limes were brown and old (old, brown limes give beer a nasty flavor). He came back about 15 min later asking if we were ready to order... Uh, yeah bro its been forever in restaurant time, Jon Taffer would have shut your ass down by now... I let the beer thing go again and just ordered pizza... We didn't see him for another 30 minutes when our pizza came out and he quickly delivered it and took off again... I had to get up and stop him to ask for my check and boxes for our pizza. He said \"Right away\"... Well, right away truned into another r15 minutes of waiting till I finally asked a busser for boxes. This was the first time I have left 0 In tip. I did not feel bad at all... Slowly, Oreganos has been going from a top, fun, vibey place to a dud... Honestly, I would have rather ordered to go and eaten in my car then to deal with this guy, or the seating.",

    "text": "3/12/2018 Yelp review Oregano's Pizza Bistro Tempe AZ 523 W University Dr, Tempe, AZ 85281 (480) 858-0501  Whenever I stop by an Oregano's Pizza Bistro whether it be the Tempe, Sedona, or Phoenix location I always have high expectations when it comes to their quality of food, pricing, overall atmosphere, and customer service. I go to Oregano's pretty often compared to other options, actually enjoying it so much that I went there for my last birthday because it's one of my favorite restaurants.  The food at Oregano's Pizza Bistro is unrivaled, I have yet to hear of a worthy competitor when it comes to their Italian food; the basis of most if not all of their menu options. I most commonly order the Zany Ziti. This mouthwatering dish is a large pasta bread bowl topped in prime meat sauce, Italian cheeses, a pinch of oregano, and a piece of garlic bread on the side. I have yet to be disappointed by this dish; the consistency of how exquisite it tastes along with it always brought hot and fresh to my table will continually bring me back for many years to come. Not to mention kind waiters offering an abundance of additional parmesan cheese which they drizzle over your food right before diving into your Italian pasta that has become so familiar to me. However along with the delicious pasta dishes, Oregano's Pizza Bistro also offers wings, salads, pizza, and sandwiches. These however I can't speak on since I only go to Oregano's specifically for the outstanding pasta. In addition to the amazing food, if you're looking to eat out and not break the bank then you're in luck. Although prices vary most commonly between 7 to 20 dollars you will be met with an abundance of high quality food which I find myself in most cases having to get a to-go box anyways to finish the next day. Unlike food chains that are sub 5 dollar range you will be met with low grade ingredients and mediocre customer service.  Walking into an Oregano's Pizza Bistro alone is a soothing experience. The aroma of succulent food pollutes the air while generous waiters welcome you in.  Every one of their locations I have been to also look similar internally and externally. The overall aesthetic this restaurant goes for is an old school style that has emphasis on decorations such as televisions, pictures, lighting, wood, and others. This type of atmosphere really boosts the overall experience and compliments the already delicious food effortlessly.   Last but not least in order for any restaurant to succeed they must provide exceptional customer service. Time and time again I am always met with happy and polite employees which really sets the mood for the whole eating experience. Waiters will come back multiple times throughout eating a meal making sure everyone is satisfied on drinks, food, and the temptation of ordering additional sides or dessert. In the end whenever I choose to eat out at Oregano's Pizza Bistro I can always rely on them providing me high quality Italian food at an affordable price, a unique environment, and astounding customer service.",

    "text": "I don't know why I always have bad luck at Organos.  First off they have pepsi but they used to have great green tea so I agreed to go.  No more.  Sorry it was voted out.  Ok so I tried a passion fruit tea.  I drink green because it's supposed to be healthy.  But no big deal it wasn't bad.  We had great service.  Very nice young female.  Good sense of humor too.  We ordered.  She was helpful there.  I looked through yelp and found something that l couldn't live with out.  The girl ordered a chicken parm sandwich.  I noticed waffle fries so she switched out the chips.  She was very happy.  I got the Lady Shrimp Scampi.  I love fussilli pasta and shrimp.  It came out cold.  I mean the pasta was actually cold.  The shrimp looked under cooked.  Not crispy and plump like the photo someone had posted.  The waitress came and apologized.  She said is the pasta really cold.  I felt another peace and sure enough it was cold.  I said maybe I should get something else.  But she took it back and had them fix it.  Mean while I enjoyed a few waggle fries from the girl.  Her sandwich I have to say was very good.  The chicken was cooked perfect.  Crispy and juicy still.  The garlic break roll was warm and also perfect not over cooked or old or anything like my awful pasta.  They bring out another one but I have to say I'm pretty sure the cook just stuck it in the microwave because the sauce was now gross.  The shrimp still looked pathetic and pasta was chewy.  So I asked to order something else.  I got the anti pasta salad.  It came out and it was not bad.  IT's annoying how they load so much on there because my artichoke rolled off the plate and on to the floor.  But they give a few.  The issue here is that the tomato was chopped and few times I got tastes of rotten tomato.  And my tea.  Well by now it was 10pm and the other server dumped them all out.  I asked to try black but that was gone too.  So my rotten salad had to go with a water.  And that's my story.  But let's just think about this for one second.  The cook sent out a pasta dish with cold pasta.  It was actually cold to the touch.  I looked at it and could tell the shrimp didn't look right.  It's common to get shrimp that seems under cooked.  I think some cooks see it curled so they take it off the grill.  But you want to cook that shrimp so it has flavor.  This is why scampi is one of the best Shrimp dishes.  But then don't send it out tasting like it was microwaved.  But let's be honest the real crime here is the manager who didn't rush over to apologize.  She did come over and kind of mumbled I'm sorry about the ice tea I'll take that off your check.  Obviously you can't charge me for ice tea if I'm drinking water.  But if you care that much about customers being served cold pasta you don't care about training the cooks to make the food properly.  And you also wouldn't have them send out salad with rotten tomatoes.  Maybe offer a free desert or something.  What I probably should have done was just leave and gone home and ate instead of them having to make food for me now when they are supposed to be closed.  Obviously they aren't going to care at that point they want to go home.  But don't compensate customers who are there an hour now still waiting for diner . At least my girl enjoyed her chicken parm sandwich.  It was good.  But I'm not sure how I can ever go back there.  Having a nice server isn't enough.  There are 100 other places in Tempe to eat.   I used to really like Oreganos when they first opened in Scottsdale while I was in college it was one of my favorite places to go.  It's a shame.",

Maybe that's because I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NY... This place is a joke, and a flat, unflavored one.   45-60 min wait for a 10 inch deep dish?? (For the boyfriend, I'd never go against NY thin crust tradition) WUZZAMADDA WIT YOU! (Oreganos feel free to use my amazing authentic Italian catch phrase. It was the only one you didn't use on your menu.   Wtf is an Italian place doing having guacamole and quesadillas ...  ?!   The thin crust was very floppy and greasy - signs their oven isn't hot enough and the cheese is low quality. The chicken parm was okay. Standard Disneyland quality IMO.

It was hard as a rock and didn't have a lot of flavor. The real star was the desert- salted caramel cookie with ice cream. He said they like to feed you, and he wasn't lying.

You'll need a life jacket in order to survive in this sea of buttery, cheesy, sweet and salty deep dish pizza.   I travel a lot, and when I'm in the Phoenix area, I ALWAYS eat at Oreganos.  Creature of habit? Yes, so I always get the Kale Caesar salad prior to the main show.   This is a HUGE salad loaded with fresh kale and topped with some killer fresh ingredients, including shredded parmesan, raisins and almonds.  The flavor killer.  BAM.  After the salad comes the main event - deep dish sausage pizza.  OMG!!!!!  You'll need to take a bucket or something to contain the drool flowing from your mouth.  The pizza is indescribably rich with cheese, butter, sausage and onion.  And the crust?  *GASP*.  Makes me weak in the knees to talk about.  Decadent.  I douse my pizza with additional Parmesan cheese and, of course, oregano!!  Like most of my meals, I drink it with a big ole' glass of milk (quit your eye rolling).  Could I get it in a sippy cup?    The service is topnotch.  Very prompt, friendly and attentive staff.    I've not tried much else because, as I mentioned above, I am a creature of habit.   Working on this so I can provide the most complete and diverse reviews.  5 stars for sure!    Happy eating and traveling!",

The drinks came out quick and were good, however my drinks was just lemonade I think.  We ordered a flat pizza because the deep dish takes an hour to get ready. I also ordered the stuffed mushrooms as appetizer. The appetizer was actually 2 huge caps covered with shredded beef, tomatoes, cheese... it was good but not warm enough. The pizza came out fast and it was absolutely terrible. Gladly I had the appetizer because the pizza was inedible. Chewy, no flavor, dried out, weird detached dry elastic type crust. Worst pizza ever. Bad choice for dinner. Service was good but that's about it. Plenty of parking space around the restaurant is good too.",

Went here for lunch in between work and ended up getting our food to go because after 45 min, it still wasn't ready and we were going to be late getting back to work. After the waitress brought us our check and we paid, we waited a little longer and then finally got up and went towards the front to let our waitress we really had to go. The waitress was pleased and kind, apologetic and got the manager for us. When the manager came outside, she said are food was almost out and I expressed to her very kindly that we had been waiting almost an hour and couldn't wait much longer. Her exact response to me was and I quote\" your ticket says 23 min\" with an attitude ! Basically saying, your full of it and just being impatient. I told it \"well it should say 40 min, because that's how long we waited\".  and guess what! lol we're still waiting. We didn't ask for a discount and we were never rude, yet this manager offered nothing! Not even an apology. Instead I was given attitude and treated like I was just being impatient. The waitress offered to take my number down and call me later to discuss the issue. I also ordered my Brussel sprouts to be simply steamed and that's it. No oil or cheese. And yet they are drenched in oil. That was my experience with this location and it's very apparent that the manager working today needs a class on how to deal with customers.   Update ! 9/6/2019 I have still not received the gift card I was offered due to my experience at this location. The manager called me and was very kind, very apologetic, offered to send me a gift card but I have yet to receive it.",

As always the pizza was fantastic. The service was slower than usual but the worse thing was that this delicious cookie we came for was burnt and tasted burnt. We told the waitress that hthe cookie was burnt and she nicely told us she would tell the cook. Oreganos being the quality pizza house that they are should of offered to take the burnt  cookie off the bill.   After writing my original review the company Oreganos did ask me to write them an e-mail to further discuss the issue. I wrote them as they requested with no response.  Oreganos wrote me back and made everything right by providing the customer service that I am use to from there establishment. Once again this is my favorite place to eat pizza as it is the best tasting one I have run into. I appreciate the follow up customer service which indicates a business truly cares for their customers.",

The parking lot is somewhat small, and it was full when we my son and I left at 7pm. Get there early. I had the sausage sandwich with sauteed onions and mushrooms. A very sizeable dish. I only ate half. My son ordered the chicken parm on top of pasta. A big portion size on a platter. We had the calamari - but would pass on that next time. Not sure it was frozen, but all the calamari looked the same size and no tentacles. Most likely? The cookie and ice cream desert was good, but I the cookie was too gooey, too soft. Next time I will ask for well done. Anyway, the food was delicious. Service was great. Managers checked on us. That's the usual at Oregano's. I like going there. I'll be back.",

    "text": "I honestly am amazed that this is one of the highest rated Oregano's. First, I would like to start by saying I love their food. However, I struggle with the service at this location. My Oregano's of choice is the one in Mesa off Southern Ave and Dobson based off of service and food. I have been in to the Tempe location a couple of times during Midday Lunch Rush, which I would assume means, lunch portions and quick service to get you back to that 9-5p... not here. My party came at 12p and by the time we left it was close to 1:30p. I don't know about a lot of other businesses in the area but this is not a lunch friendly establishment if I have to be here for an hour and a half.   Upon arrival, we checked in with the hostess who gave a lot of attitude and did not come off friendly at all even to the party in front of us. We were seated very shortly after the party before us as well. We opted to sit outside due to a shorter wait time. Our server Cierra was nice, however she came took our drink orders, brought our drinks, took our lunch orders and disappeared for 40 minutes. Not once was our drinks checked on or were we updated on our food status. ------- I am sorry, but if I have to sit outside in the 101 degree Arizona heat, someone should be constantly checking to make sure everyone is staying hydrated. Proper hydration can put people in better moods, which would probably help when the food is taking a while. We watched the table who got seated just before us receive their drinks, salads, lunch AND dessert before our food came. Their group size doesn't matter in comparison to ours, they had just about the same amount of people but twice the amount of food. When the food arrived, my coworker got her salad probably 30 minutes before the actual meal when she specifically asked they come together. I got the Big Rig and my noodles were cold, but at that point it was either suck it up and eat them, or complain and risk taking a even longer lunch. Then to make it worse, we were trying to pay quickly to leave and getting our checks took a while, but cashing out took even longer. I'm just frustrated, and honestly the attitudes that I received didn't make me feel comfortable. I don't know if it's the heat, but I probably won't be returning to this Oregano's any time in the near future.",

This place is smaller than the one in Scottsdale (close to us) but just as good. Our server was awesome and looked after us very well. We shared our fav pizza (Numero Uno) and some wings.. and had a beer. Was always going to be a good expereince - love Oregano's.",

    "text": "I often stop by Oreganos monthly as they have a great Chicago Italian style menu and great service. If it's a hit day, I recommend the frozen Bellini. It's a house specialty of a mixture of Chianti, Triple Sec, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and s fee other secret ingredients. They also have a beer on tap, in bottles and on draft as well as a full bar.   This is a fun place to sit at the bar solo, enjoy a high top with a special someone or snag a booth or patio table with the family.   You can't go wrong with any of the thin crust pizzas, pastas, or salads. A favorite of mine is the Mac and cheese, Vini bambino salad, wings and calamari. The cheese bread is also the size of a boat. Make sure to bring your appetite as nothing here is small because they cater to family portions.   Week night evenings are easy to get in; however, Friday and Saturday nights you should expect a wait. But don't worry as it's well worth it.   For dessert, end the night with a tasty pazookie. A tasty pizza cookie cooked to perfection as to not be too crispy with a top of ice cream. You also have many selections to choose from and like their pizzas can go half and half without hesitation.",

    "text": "I am absolutely flabbergasted that this bistro is rated so high. I pulled in and found that parking was extremely tight but was able to pull into a spot as another left. I saw many people were waiting for seats and was glad that I was doing a to go order. It was a mix of families as well as many college students as its only 100 yards or so from the university.  I walked in through the back door and navigated to the front of the restaurant where I sat at the bar and placed a to go order for a pepperoni Chicago style deep dish pizza, about $19 for a 10\". The gal informed me it would take about 45 to 50 minutes so that I could leave and come back or just hang out.   Once I got back, parking was nearly impossible. I had to drive around for a good 15 minutes and parked about 1/4 mile away in another parking lot running in so I wouldnt get towed. Since this is a university area, all parking (even neighborhood), are private or blocked off. Once I went in the gal was just as nice and gave me my pizza which smelled pretty darn good.  Once I got back to my hotel I opened the box and saw the grease laced pizza calling out to me \"eat me, eat me!\". Oh shit, I was about to make love to this pizza, I thought. I love chicago style pizza and its rare to find a good one outside of Chicago (Tonys Little Italy in Placentia CA is an exception). I grabbed a slice by the base making sure to cradle the back as it began to sink a bit from the weight of this meaty monstrosity. I could feel the warmth as it got close to my lips and wrapped my mouth around it. William H effing Macy was that thing salty. I focused on what was in my mouth and felt some grease leaking out as I hesitantly swallowed it.   Enough with the suggestive descriptions. But I was shocked! This thing was so damn salty I couldnt believe it! I took another bite and again, this was bad. I grabbed the utensils placing the slice down and did some science biting into the bread. The bread was soft but I dont care for bread too much so moved on. The cheese and sauce, a bit salty but not what I had tasted before. It was then that I took a bit of some pepperoni (which there is a lot of) and holy crap I had to close my eyes as it was nearly unbearable. I repeated the process finding the exact same thing.   The pepperoni was overly salty. combined with the sauce and cheese made for combination that could stop hearts. I ended up throwing over half of it away and not even saving it as I had expected too as it was probably the WORST Chicago style deep dish I have ever had. The only saving grace was the service as that was excellent.",

Then I actually met one like that.  Oreganos reminds me of just such a grandmother.  The wait is terrible.  Really.  Bring a fucking book. Better yet, load the back of your pickup with a generator, a wide screen TV and your favorite game console.  Or better yet, bring a DVD player, your favorite movie and some lawn chairs and make everyone happy.  Cause you'll all be sitting there for a very long time.  You will finish the movie.  You might meet the love of your life, court, get engaged, become disillusioned and divorce before you get called for a table.  Deal with it.  It's pretty much worth it.  The pasta dishes are all great.  I like most of the sandwiches except for the turkey.  The pizza is good but it takes a while.  I like all of the salads.  The portions here are fucking obscene.  That's right.  That's the only way I can put it across to you so that you'll understand.  Plan to share if you don't want to be eating the leftovers you took home for a week.  If you don't believe me, you'll have plenty of time to check it out for yourself while you're waiting for your table.  Because like I said, it's going to be a while.  This is good because it gives you time to build up an enormous appetite so you can begin to contemplate actually finishing your meal.  You may even believe somehow that you're going to do it.  But don't kid yourself.  It's not possible.  The saving grace here is that the food is quite good.  Kind of a spicy take on Italian with a few curve balls thrown in just to mess with you.  Try the UFOs.  They're disgusting.  Disgustingly good.  You'll hate yourself in the morning, but you'll enjoy every delicious bite.  When the bill comes, you'll be surprised.  I paid what?  For all of that?  Don't make a big deal about it or try to get your waiter to double check it for you.  It really is that cheap.  Why do you think you and 40 other otherwise reasonable people waited for over an hour just to sit in a kitchy booth and be doted on?  What's that? You ate it all? No way. Are you sure?  Geeze dumbass, now look what you did.  How are you ever gonna have room for their signature warm cookie pizza treat thing with ice cream on top?  It's the whole reason you go.  I tried to warn you.",

And to make it even more special one can choose lettuce or spinach or half lettuce and half spinach. A half order is adequate for lunch or dinner. A full order is more than most people eat. And if you aren't WHEAT free; (notice I cheated once of a few bites) the killer skillet baked hot from the oven Chocolate chip or Macademia nut cookie with icecream are a must. Or you can have half Chocolate chip and half Macademia nut. They aim to please.   I have eaten at all the Valley of the Sun locations and Flagstaff. They are all equally excellent in service and food. I was delighted when Oregano's opened a location at Elliot and I10 near where I live. I bring all my out of town guests to Oregano's.",

It took my boyfriend and I almost 20 minutes to order because we were trying to get something different that we both wanted to eat. Our waitress was so relaxed and willing to help, she finally took pity on us and suggested two dishes - which we jumped on.  The Big Rig Pasta was SO YUMMY! A+ for her first suggestion...though I wish I could say the same for her other suggestion. The stuffed mushrooms which was her second suggestion were \"eh.\" I'm not going to hold it against her though because she was just trying to help us. The mushrooms weren't that great, I think it had more to do with the sausage which the mushrooms were stuffed with and the overall texture of all the ingredients, just didn't do it for us. But I'd like to mention that even though these mushrooms were a bit gross, they were still 100% better than anything I ate at Avalon in Scottsdale. I'd rather eat stuffed mushrooms for the rest of my life then eat another dish at Avalon.  I am so bummbed though because even though I only took  a few bites of the mushrooms, I basically stuffed my face with the Big Rig dish and so at the end I was so full I couldn't eat their one dessert - which is what I wanted to order first but my boyfriend wouldn't let me until I had \"real food\" first. Ugh, next time dessert is #1 for this chic! :)",

    "text": "I get a craving to come here about every other week.  Their food is consistently fantastic, even with their large, diverse menu.  The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!  Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.  Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it.",

    "text": "Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water!! Such a tease! I wish we had one here in the Bay. The menu is HUGE and I mean that figuratively and literally. You can fan yourself with the menu, block out the entire neighboring table, build a fort, omg it's freakin' huge. I almost poked my friends eye out a few times oh and almost knocked everything off of the table. Everything here is HUGE. The water glass alone requires you to double hand it. If you are a soda lover like me and drink it so fast that you hate waiting for a refill...well you won't have that problem here because your soda glass is about a liter :) yippee!!   I ordered the antipasti salad and it had so much yummy meat in it! It was a darn tasty salad and the dressing wasn't overpowering. I think it probably had more meat than lettuce...not complaining! One friend had the hot wings, yup, they have a diverse menu. The other friend had the ravioli. It was one giant ravioli! I had a few bites of it and it was good but it can definitely be a bit too much ravioli.   The table next to us had a little tike and they gave him a roll of fresh dough and a pizza pan so that he could play with it. Kinda cool...wonder why we didn't get that option ;-)   Again, wish this place was in the Bay Area. I love that they had misters in their patio/waiting area. It's obviously not there for looks. Did I mention Phoenix is HOT?! Heart this place!",

Like another reviewer, I thought they were known for their pizza but the pizza was my least favorite out of all the dishes (trust me, I live in Little Italy in San Francisco so I have had my share of pizza).   The portions and the cheap prices are out of control but I guess that means you get a big bang for your buck. We went on a weekday for lunch and didn't have to wait which was great.",

    "text": "Parking is a joke, limited seating (especially inside) is among the worst of all popular restaurants in Arizona, and the crowd of college kids and self-styled Mill Ave. area business professional types makes for one annoying dining experience.  I've wondered why the owners bother to choose these locations, especially in areas that have horrible street parking when the daily event of overflowing parking occurs.  You have to realize this ruins the whole experience from the start.   It's all fabricated hype - excessively limit the seating and parking, always have a waitlist, and viola you've created the appearance of overflowing demand.  If you go immediately when they open you can often get a seat at the bar and then things are tolerable - just get the individual slices with beer and they'll get you in and out of there fast.  You won't have to listen to complicated explanations for why their pizza takes so long.  They also haven't adjusted the music volume up louder and louder yet either, so again... go when they open.  The fried spicy ravioli are tasty, but I'm struggling to say something positive here.",

The service is always good, even though this location is the busiest.  I haven't had anything other than the pizza, but friends who have tried other things say they are good.  Plus, the pizza cookie for dessert on a special occasion is always a treat!  Oregano's has a heavy hand with the spices usually, but I like that so it's great for me.    I did take-out once and it was great.  Will use them again!",

I ordered The Original Bollo Pasta which is all you can eat for $7 before tax/tip. However, what I'd calculated to be about a $10 meal before tax/tip turned out to cost me nearly double. I added meat for $3.29 and thought it was also all you can eat -- nope (so don't make that mistake like I did). To add one type of meat for $3.29 one time only was definitely not worth it. However this seemed like an error on my end so I don't fault Oregano's (except that they could have written it more clearly on the menu). Overall I'm a fan and will return.",

The appetizer came out fine, the bread it comes with reminded me of my old work back in california which made me nostalgic.   Then came the pizza. He ordered half meatballs and mushrooms, I ordered half Cajun chicken and pineapple. When it came out they had made my side a hawaiian (ham and pineapple). I politely informed the waitress then went to the bathroom quickly. The toilet outside was broken so I had to lift up the back and manually flush the toilet (something I never thought I would have to do at a place of business) and by the time I came back they had already talked to my boyfriend about making another pizza, only thin crust (because the deep dish takes 45 min). Then dessert came out delicious as always.   They didn't comp our pizza like my boyfriend was lead to believe by the manager (which was fine). Nevertheless, I gave the woman a good tip and left.   I ate the thin crust today (they just immediately boxed it for us I wasn't hungry at that point last night) and there was a HAIR in my pizza. They messed up not one but TWO pizzas for me and I had to flush their toilet. As much as I love this place I am not coming back for a very long time.",

I caved the first time and got a stuffed Chicago pizza that was out of this world.  Now I get the above-mentioned salad and I feel beyond satiated.

This is a great place for dining in a big group. My friends and I like to get together for dinner here sometimes. There are pizzas (and many variations of it), wings, salads, sandwiches and pastas on the menu. There's bound to something for everyone here which makes group dining easier.   For the pizza, you can choose between thin, stuffed or pan crusts. I always go for the thin crust and my favorite is the chicken pesto one. They have signature pizzas or you can create your own. There are many different toppings to choose from (even carnitas & cotija cheese) and the combinations are endless.   I also like that they have my favorite type of wings here- golden wings. Yummy. And they are quite large, too.   For dessert, share a pizza cookie. It comes hot out of the oven and topped with some ice cream. Perfect ending to close out a meal.",

We were seated right away, and quickly decided to splitsy the Jr Caesar salad and the meatball sub (is it me or can you tell who's a close friend if you can splitsy meals?!)  The JUNIOR salad was enormous, and we should have used our better judgement and got the Jr meatball as well...but our roaring stomachs got the better of us.  We each only got through half of our half, and left a lot of salad on the plate.  Food was good but not great - caesar is pretty generic and the meatball sub is as good as a meatball sub can be.  3 stars for consistency and large portions and reasonable prices - we got outta there with an $8 tab each.",

The place was so alive time flew and we were seated. The server was great and fast with drinks and orders. She also brought my daughter pizza dough to play with which kept her occupied the whole time! Food was amazing! Apps: wings and toasted ravioli Dinner: deep dish pie with pepperoni sausage onions peppers! So wonderful only had room for a slice each but so glad to have the rest of it tonight! Lasagna was also great and plenty left over also I wish we would've been able to try the cookie but we were all going to roll out of there as it was....next time!  Final bill was only $59!",

    "text": "I didn't have a good experience at Oreganos. I came in with my boyfriend expecting good food since there is usually a line when we drive by, and I was really disappointed. We sat in the patio area where there were at least 40 flies buzzing around outside landing on customers and on the food. I couldn't even put my hands on the table because it was so sticky and gross. The silverware was also dirty. Our server was okay, she was nice but didn't put any extra effort into anything, even when she said goodbye she was already walking away before she finished and it wasn't even that busy. The food was okay and overpriced. The spinach/artichoke dip was good but the pasta (rigatoni) was awful. It had no meat in the sauce and tasted like it was prepared from the freezer, which wouldn't surprise me if it really was. The garlic bread was comparable to frozen garlic bread you can get from any grocery store and bake in the oven for five minutes. I made a comment to my boyfriend saying how the food wasn't good but it was fine for being cheap- but that was before I got the bill. I payed over $40 for my meal and felt totally ripped off. I don't understand why people review this place well and why there are ever lines outside of it. Maybe people just don't know better. Won't be returning.",

The \"Heck of Slice\" is usually what I order. It's fast and a great value.  The pizza is nice Chicago-style with a crisp crust and tangy sauce.  The Pizza Cookie is a tasty desert but since it's usually shared (it's made from a 1/2 pound of cookie dough) it gets messy looking fast.  Parking at this location can be a real pain, and I'd recommend going right when they open at 11am if you want to minimize all the hassles that come with a very popular place.",

Last night, we left our first visit to Oreganos both satisfied and in great anticipation of our return.    The atmosphere is very friendly and laid back.  The decor is reminiscent of a hometown pizza joint from the '50's.  Outdoors is a large patio with a bar.  The entire staff makes you feel at home, with the hostesses calling your name as a friend would, not as someone waiting in line at the butcher.  The wait staff is equally friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations.    Our service was matched in satisfaction by our food.  We started with the Guaca Tony, a delicious pairing of garlic pizza crust chips and Italian guacamole.  For dinner, we split the Big Rig Pasta, agreeably, a favorite of our server.  Our meal was washed away with a pitcher of Dos Equis, leaving us no room for one of Oreganos' popular cookies for dessert.   However, I would welcome a better beer selection for such a unique destination.  This is a place that would be great to bring your family or a large group of friends.  We'll definitely be returning soon.",

As is I usually take half of the monstrous sandwich home to devour for breakfast the next morning. The vino bambino salad is glorious.  I haven't tried pizza here, but everything else is great. When family from out of state comes to visit I like to get a party-sized trough of various pastas and the garden salad, and everyone in my family has really enjoyed this. They'll make ziti without the meat as well if you want to please a gathering of vegetarians.",

I don't know if it is intentional or just bad choices but the parking at most of the valley restaurants is horrible.

When the weather is nice there is nearly nothing better than sitting outside on the little patio with a glass of wine and a pie while Sinatra and Martin serenade you into a drunken bliss. While the menu isn't necessarily groundbreaking, it is mostly very tasty. Their pizza is always cooked well, melty and gooey without being burnt or too crisp. And they don't throw a ridiculous amount of sauce on it, just enough for a tangy bite to fight the creaminess of the cheese. Service is mostly top notch, though being in a college town like Tempe, they tend to have young servers and there can be an occasional miss. If my wife liked Oregano's as much as me, we would both be obese. I love visiting, the food is great, and they have the pazookie. PAZOOKIE. Four Stars.",

I was headed to some other place that I'd found on Yelp, but was having trouble finding it, when there was Oregano's!  Having had In-N-Out burger for lunch and wanting something light, I remembered Leeanna's statement that she never even tried the pizza here since the salad was that amazing.  So I pulled in to the packed parking lot, past the crowd of folks waiting for a table, and headed for the take out counter.  I opted for the Junior versions of the signature salad and the veggie wedgie.   I sat by the door, since even the bar was full, but didn't wait more than 10 minutes.  The salad was yummy and HUGE, even though I only got the Jr.  I don't particularly care for raisins, so I guess I should have asked to get one without, but it was still delicious.  As with the salad, the veggie wedgie Jr was still HUGE.  I hadn't realized when I ordered it that it came with waffle fries.  Everything had gotten a little spongy and soggy in transport, but that's my fault.  The flavor was still delicious - great combination of eggplant, spinach, tomato, cheese.  I'll definitely come back for more next time I'm in Phoenix.",

If you're there for lunch, grab a pablo picasso salad and a passion fruit iced tea.  If you're there for dinner make sure you try the bellinis, the pesto bruscetta, the thin crust pizza...and again, the pablo picasso salad!!!!

All of them get very packed, there's a 30+ minute wait to get seated on weekends and a 30+ minute wait if you want a pan pizza. At least servers tell you that up front.  Servers are pretty friendly too. So much so that multiple friends think they have a shot at dating them by the time we're done eating.   We've chosen to sit at the bar at the Tempe location to avoid long waits in getting a table. Problem is, and I don't know if they do this at all the locations, they'll charge you for certain soft drinks (mainly soda water) at the bar but never when you're at a table.   I've never questioned it but I don't understand it.   Parking is pretty decent here and there's an abundance of chairs in the parking lot and reading material for people who are waiting to get  a seat. There's a large outdoor seating section too, but I don't know if they bring the heaters out there during winter nights like they do in Mesa.  Even weekend afternoons here could warrant a wait. I'd avoid it during ASU basketball games or football Saturdays.",

Hotel recommended Oregano's which was a pleasant surprise. We almost didn't stay as there was a 30 min wait and we needed to get the kid food and to bed, but as she was eagerly scrutinizing the menu selections, the hostess told us that 3 seats at the bar were opening up and we could order from full menu there. What a life saver! The hostesses were really friendly and nice.  Sat at bar and Matt served us. Gave us great and honest recommendations without being pushy. Was really friendly with good sense of humor. Was really efficient and on the ball too.  He made the experience so much better. From our seats, we could also see the Pit Crew making the pizza dough which was fun to watch.  The salads were wonderfully enormous as we eat a lot of salad! The three of us shared one large salad - can't remember name but was the special salad- really delicious. Then we got lasagna for kid and us parents ordered the Alfredo the Dark    that Matt recommended which was very good, added sausage and chicken. Sizable  portions - still no room for dessert.  Overall, atmosphere was lovely, staff was friendly and terrific (esp Matt), food was filling and delicious, and we had a great time. We may go back tonight to try something else! :-)  Went back again tonight - ended up at the bar again.  Caitlyn served us and was fabulous - sense of humor, quick service, honesty - I think Oregano's is just great.  When I'm back in Phoenix, I'll be coming to this location.  FYI, ALL the staff are super-friendly.",

Just go with whatever strikes you at the moment. I'm happy I live right by here so I can go often. I love walking by and smelling all the deliciousness wafting from the restaurant. I like sitting outdoors here. I can't comment on the Chicago style pizza because I personally do not like thick pizzas.",

    "text": "I met Andrea K. here for lunch.  I haven't been to Oregano's in nearly 2 years and I've never been to this location.  I thought I'd arrive a few minutes early so we wouldn't have to wait since Andrea was on her lunch break.  I forgot how stingy and rude they can be about seating you until your entire party has arrived. OK so if I was alone I would still get seated at a 2 or 4 top so whats the BFD if she hasn't arrived yet!  I wait and look at the menu, which they have redone since my last visit, what an eye-crossing mess they turned it into.  YAY! Andrea arrives we get seated and order our drinks. The waiter does not tell Andrea that the Ice tea is flavored, she asks if he minded getting her a soda instead.  Waiting for that soda................................... Since we are seated right next to the drink station I offer to grab her soda for her........I pretty much get yelled at by some waitress,she gets it for her instead.  OK so I ended up ordering something I have never tried before the \"Veggie Wedgie\" (wedge-cut foccocia bread  with dusted sauteed eggplant, fresh portabello mushrooms and provolone cheese and baked. It's then stuffed with roma tomatoes, spinach, goat cheese and feta cheese, along with an aioli dressing placed on the side for dipping.) And a small dinner salad.  They have also changed the salads since my last visit, it used to be romaine and mozzarella now its spring greens and gorgonzola.......either way its good.  My sandwich arrives and each half is bigger than my head,WOW!  it looks good too.............Looks can be deceiving....it was not so good.....the eggplant was bland and cold, the sandwich did not seem \"baked\" enough and over all not really much flavor going on, and how on earth they thought I could dip that huge thing into their tiny cup of Over garlicked aioli is beyond me.  When waiter boy comes by I tell him its not so good, he takes it away with no hesitation. Manager come by and offers me something else, I really am full and didn't want anything but let him oblige me with a slice anyhow. I really am against getting any other food items after having to send something back....  Out comes my slice.........well cheese is sliding to one side and it's covered in a black soot as is the pineapple....maybe it fell on the floor to teach me a lesson??? I should have took a picture! All the other slices I saw go by looked pristine...what happened to mine?  I wasn't planning on eating it anyway, I was full.  I apologize to the waiter about the sandwich again and her assures me that its no problem they always encourage people to try something new, if you don't like it they will take it off the bill no problem. ~I thought that was great customer service on their part.  So they did take off my sandwich and my slice from the bill, Thanks Again guys!  ~Andrea and I are still chatting......... ~Waiter: \"can I get you some boxes?\" ~ Us: \"OK\" 5 minutes later ~Waiter: \"Do you need help boxing that up?\" ~US: \"No thanks\" 5 minutes later ~ Waiter: \"Can I Get you a to go cup for your drinks?\"  Geesh I Think we can take a hint, I guess we'll get going....there wasn't any people waiting to be sat so whats the rush??  3 stars for Their hospitable understanding over the bad sandwich",

But geez, it seems like ask any ASU student where to eat and they get stars in their eyes as they talk about \"Oregano's.\" It seems to be on everyone's favs on their Facebook pages.   So, I guess it would be hard to live up to the hype.  Honestly, for my money, there's far better (and cheaper) pizza in Tempe just up the street and there's not a 20-30 minute wait nor any hype. The pizza's fine here, but nothing spectacular. Same with the pasta dishes. The waiters kinda annoy me with their buddy-buddy schtick, \"Hey, good job bra, you finished that huge pie.\" I feel like I'm five.    I dunno. I feel so awkward eating at a place where it seems everyone else is just so excited to be there, and I just don't understand.",

    "text": "3 and a half stars.   I finally had my first ever Valley Oregano's experience tonight. You'd think I'd have gone to the one on Camelback ages ago, because, well, I live minutes away from it, but no, it was the Tempe location which sucked me in.   Ok, not necessarily sucked me in. I drove my ass all the way out there to meet some friends for dinner, but still.   Wait was an hour which kind of bit. We were tempted to just go to Thai Basil instead but as I never had Oregano's we persisted and stayed put. Once seated, we ordered things that I won't be eating anything close to resembling for the rest of the week: the spinach salad (ok, maybe I'd eat that), the cheesy bread, a large thin crust pesto pizza, and the pizokie for dessert. I'm a huge deep dish fan (I know, I know, thin crust is how real Italian pizza is) so I'm going to reserve major potential star wattage for when I actually have one of those.   I thought the pesto thin crust was pretty decent - didn't blow me out of the water but it was good. The salad was flavorful and the cheesy bread was decent, but the pizokie dessert thing was awesome. Maybe it's because I I haven't had one of these since BJ's back in college (which is a longtime ago), but it was pretty damn delicious. Scene was pretty much college-y, loud, and full of \"like, I was all\"s, but duh, what else is it going to be.  All in all, almost all stuff not good for me but whatever. Now that I've finally had my Oregano's experience I can go on with my life. Nothing like a local pizza chain holding you back.",

    "text": "Finally made it here tonight after passing by the Scottsdale and Tempe locations on various occasions and commenting on how neat it looked.. Definitely very satisfied with our first of many visits to come.  We arrived around 8 pm on a Wednesday night and were surprised to find a wait.. Not a problem though as we found a spot at the bar to post up at. I ordered the Monosso Chianti while my fiance ordered four peaks 8th ave. Coming from a wine snob, the wine was very reasonably priced for the quality of taste.  Our table was on the patio.. It was bit chilly outside but they also had the a/c blasting inside.. A lose/lose scenario for a cold-sensitive person such as myself. I requested the outside heater above our table to be turned on..Within about 5 minutes, the heater was running and we actually ended up being way more comfortable and warm than we were waiting inside at the bar under the a/c. I really appreciated the quickness of service in that regard!  I ordered the Kale Caesar salad while my fiance ordered the chicken parm. My one complaint isn't even a True complaint but rather a personal preference and suggestion.. The size of my salad was so large it was falling off my plate. It took some serious work to eat from it and not make an absolute mess. I get that some restaurants go for the \"shock and awe\" of large portions, but it was a bit frustrating to eat and I wished that it had been placed within a bowl. Otherwise, everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great.   Busy spot - Even late on a week night! As my fiance always says.. \"All those people can't be wrong\"   Superb pricing for great food and atmosphere - We loved the interior and exterior decor. It has a great retro 50's vibe complete with old movies playing on old styled tvs.  Can't wait to revisit! Thank you Oregano's!",

From the juicy stuffed mushrooms, to roasted Brussels sprouts, to my favorite salad ever ( The Pablo Picasso), to the scampi in the dark , or Big Rig pasta... I have had nearly every dish and they are all amazing, authentic and both pleasing to the eye and stomach ;)  Plus, if you are in the mood for pizza, even legit Chicago deep dish- this place is for you too!   Low carb? No fear, get a salad sans tortilla strips or croutons, or get a side of their yummy sausage with spinach..... they have something delicious for everyone!",

    "text": "Want to start off by saying that I've been going to Oregano's for the past 6 years. Everytime I come to this location I always get a bad experience. Came by around 8:20 on Tuesday May 8th, 2018. I figured we were gonna have a good one this time around because I seen the old man manager who is usually at the Elliot location and he usually runs a tight ship. We always get a kids mac n cheese for my son and my wife and I always share a big caesar salad with extra chicken and el diablo chicken pasta. The food took about 20-25 minutes to come, which is fairly long because it wasnt busy like crazy, but it was modest amount of traffic coming in and out where it shouldn't have taken that long. When they did bring the food out, they forgot the garlic toast that usually comes with both pastas (diablo & m&c). They barely put any diablo pasta sauce in the dish which this location is bad at doing. When they finally brought the garlic bread, my son's was completely burned, black, and hard on one end and my wife's was also overly cooked and was partially hard. She brought up to the waitress attention about the pasta sauce and she said she would bring an extra side of it, which she never did and she played it off like she didnt know, but I doubt that they didnt even make the extra side of sauce. So after we finished she gave us the check without asking for dessert which we did want a pizza cookie to go. After ringing it up the dessert, she came back and told us that she would give us the pizza cookie for free because of all the inconvience of the diablo pasta which we hardly ate because of the fact that it was mostly pasta and no sauce. The original bill was 34 and change not including the pizza cookie since she had brought the bill before I ordered the desert. Since she said it'd be free, I put my card in the check book so she can charge the 34. When she came back, I noticed that the original itemized receipt still had 34, but the debit card receipt showed 39 and change so she still charged us for the pizza cookie after she said she wouldn't. We waited and waited for her to come by to bring it to her attention, but she was taking so long that we just left and grabbed our dessert on the way out. This is about the 3rd and final disappointing experience we've had with this specific location and it always seems to be the same inconsistent issues and I believe it's because of the college students who are working. They dont take their job serious and they're just there to get by college by doing the minimum at work and of management for not making sure they're doing what they're suppose to, especially when the old man manager with the unusual walk is there. We will not be coming back here. We will just drive the extra mileage and continue going to the Elliot location where it is 10x better. For those first timers, you'll probably rate it 5 stars because you dont know any better, but if you're a long time costumer like us then you'll know the difference and you'll know that Organo's has fallen back a little because they're portions are smaller than before, they try to be cheap now when it comes to the expensive dishes and ingredients and sauces. They use to allow half chicken and shrimp on pasta and now you can only get one or the other. They use have the choice of shredded or cube chicken which was awesome because the cube chicken was way better than the shredded and now they just do shredded. They've changed a little throughout the years and its definitely not for the better. Just wish they can go back to the old Oregano's where it gave you the feeling of a family mom and pop shop which is what made it special and made me excited to keep showing people about this establishment, but now they just carry themselves as another franchise big chain restaurant who cares more about profits then the satisfaction and happiness of their new and long time customers.",

Then we topped it off with a pizza cookie, that things is so good. If you want some really good pizza and don't mind the wait then you have to try this place!",

Everything I've eaten has been good not only the first time, but as a leftover as well.  Mmm!  The garlic bread with cheese makes for a great appetizer, and I confess I've also ordered it as my entre at least twice now.  Always get that homemade, meatless marinara too!  The salads are huge and delicious!  The pizza is thin and very West Coast, but it's alright.  I love the pasta dishes.  Also the Veggie Wedgie is a delightful vegetarian sandwich, truly unique and tasty.  The giant cookie dessert is worth it, if you make it to dessert and have someone to share it with.  The wine, beer, and cocktails available are also very nice and affordable at about $5 each.  They even sell shirts there for a reasonable price, if you're a huge fan like me!  There are many things on the menu that I haven't tried, I admit.  Some of that is due to the large amounts of meat in most dishes.  Otherwise, it's simply because I'm too hungry to wait for the 30-40 minute wait times many menu items incur.  I bring my out-of-town guests here when they're craving Italian.  This particular location seems busier than most, but you can't beat it.  And their slogans are right; garlic breath is sexy.",

The margarita I got in a moment of insanity was horrible but at least it was fairly strong.  We showed up at 4:30 PM and didn't have to wait for a table, but waited an hour from the time we ordered to get our pizza (a pan and a thin crust).  People were waiting for tables before 6 PM.  Had to get the pizookie at a friend's recommendation.  Definitely yummy but not irresistibly so.  I'm glad to have gone, and I'd recommend it for someone new to check out, but I don't think I'd ever go back.  The food is good and reasonably priced but not worth the hour wait for cooking plus the 1-4 hr wait just to be seated.  If I did go back, it would only be on an off-hour.",

This is the spot for the get together with a group of my friend's classmates. They get together at least twice a month and the place is always Oregano's.  For sentimental value it has turned into a tradition for them.  I was lucky to get invited to one of the get-togethers once and I'm somewhat inducted into the tradition. YAY!   My favorites at Oregano's\" Fell in love with this by accident because I wanted chicken so my friend ordered the BBQ Chicken- LOVES IT!!!  The pizookie!!!! YUM! YUM! YUM! The WINGS!!!! I have a friend who's adamant that Oregano's offered the best wings and here are his reasons: 1- Drummettes- no flat wings allowed   2- Skinless 3- Crisp- I must admit it is crispy 4- Sauce- you can also ask for extra sauce and dip your pizza in it- delish!! 5- Value- I think you get 14.  Now, we are not sure if they charge for 14 or for 12 and you get 14. However, my friend likes to believe that it's more wings for your bucks.  Also, this is his argument- so he can believe whatever. Last but not least, the service at the Tempe location has always been pleasant.  Our waitress there (I regret not getting her name) was superb and nice.    Overall, this is a pleasant place for get togethers and have a good time with beer, wings, pizza and pizookie. Don't forget to pick up your fortune cookie on the way out. =)",

I've been eating at oregano's for 3 years now and it's one of favorite restaurants because of its great food and friendly servers but I've never met a more amazing server ....Jordan made my my restaurant experience 1000x better! I believe I have a very good judgment in character and I honestly don't remember the last time I met a more genuine and nice person/server that really truly loves his job in my life. And at the end he offered to buy me and my friend a very yummy dessert..(pizzuki) as a nice gesture above his amazing attitude. So for everyone who goes to that place..just make sure to ask for Jordan to be ur server and enjoy a great meal with \"genuinely\" nice service.",

The food is also a decent price for the ENORMOUS portions you get - my salad lasted me seriously three days. Kind of a long wait sometimes, though. The pizzas are also good, as are the sandwiches! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. However, now that I've seen how much is in a salad, I'll probably go with that from now on... roughly $9 for a mountain of food that's gonna last me days?! Yes please. Oh, and get the pizookie for dessert [if it's your birthday, you get one for free ;)]. Get half your meal to-go and save room for it. Trust me and you're welcome.",

We ordered a large pizza and had to wait what seemed like an hour or more for our pizza. In the meantime, people arrived, were served and left. The manager finally came out and explained to us that there had been a mishap in the kitchen and they were working on our pizza now. I'm still not sure what happened but they offered to bring us a free appetizer and to comp our pizza. We politely said no thanks to the extra food, but a manager still brought us a sausage sandwich that they had an \"extra\" of. Though its not something we would have ordered on our own, we still appreciated the gesture.  I just wanted to say that though we ended up spending an extra hour at lunch waiting for our food, the service was great. We appreciated that they took full responsibility for the problem. The pizza was great and well worth the wait.  I recommend!",

    "text": "If I were ever to be grossly obese and it were due to the fact that I stuffed myself with Oregano's on a daily basis, I think I'd be willing to set my vanity aside and be quite content with that fact.   Needless to say, this is not a place to go while you are on a diet. This is the place to go when you want a good ol' fashioned carb overload Italian style. I consume more carbs in one meal here than I do in a month of eating at home. And I love every gluten filled bite of it.   Notable items:   Cheesy bread - two foot long loaf of soft wonderful white bread slathered in garlic butter with oodles of melty cheddar cheese blend. GAWD. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I don't even try to pretend I'm not a gluttonous pig when it comes to this stuff and I always help myself to the last piece.   Wings- BIG FAT drumsticks. All of them. Honey hot is delish along with the buffalo.   Caesar salad - holy crap their salads are huge. They have three sizes. The full (or whatever they call it) is big enough for four or five people to eat from if it isn't the main dish.   Bollo Pasta - with meatballs - Angel hair pasta and marinara with two huge meatballs, oh and the pasta is never ending. I have yet to see anyone get more than halfway through the first round though. *note angel hair being so thin sometimes the pasta has come out mushy(overcooked), all I've had to do was mention it and the problem was remedied in a very timely manner usually followed up by a manager visit, they don't mess around with customer service.   Pizookie - Obvi.   No, it isn't the best Italian I've EVER had but it is solid and consistent and really hits the spot when you want your fix. And the pricing is awesome. Lisa E, Nydia A and I binged at the one on Shea a couple of months ago, had the cheesy bread, wings and pizookie and our bill was $20. We sat there staring at the bill and each other dumbfounded for a couple of minutes.   If you don't like this place, all I have to say is \"Wanna PIZZA me?!\" ;)",

We requested a different Server and we ended up with Mekah. She was awesome! She went over specials and shared her favorites and different options. She was smiling and enthusiastic. She was very attentive and made our dining experience a phenomenal one. During our meal another female Manager came out and offered us a dessert on the house. Our food was amazing (we ordered the Big Rig with meatballs, chicken and sausage). We were so impressed with Mekah and her female Manager that we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "So I want to write this review before I forget all the horrendous details about the service we received. This was my first time here, I was meeting a few of my friends who attend ASU for dinner. Now being from a world that custimer service is pretty much everything I have to be honest and say that from the gate the service was lacking in every aspect. Let's start with the snotty, young hostess who THOUGHT she was being sly (by talking under her breathe and not looking directly at us but rather above our heads), about talking about our group and how (because one extra person showed up) \"messed up everything\" (her exact words). She continud to talk negatively about us and more so insult us by thinking we were deaf, maybe, because in her head I believe she didn't think we could hear her even though we were literally 4 feet from her. SMH! About 15 minutes later we were seated. Approximately 5 minutes later we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken, drinks dropped off....then almost 10 minutes later our server comes back and finally takes our order only to inform us that it's going to be about 25 minutes for our meal to come out. Now I guess it could take 25 minutes to make 4 pasta dishes, cheese bread and a sausage but that kinda seems long. Nonetheless, our food comes out but one entree short. The server then says it got messed up in the kitchen and it was going to be another 8 minutes. She then comes back and apologizes and says the manager is working on the dish and it will be out soon, about 10 min later the entree finally comes out....I'm going to cut this short as I sure you already get the picture. The experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words, sucked.  Only reason I gave them two stars was because however horrible the service was the food itself was pretty good. Portions were large and can definitely be shared. Pretty sure I won't be coming back to this restaurant again, or maybe we will just visit another location with hostesses that don't start out the dining experience so negatively.",

    "text": "First of all, the was my first visit to Oregano's.  We were here as a going away party . The restaurant does not seat incomplete parties, beware. When I arrived the party was complete and the waitress stated it would be about 15 to 20 minutes for seating. 40 minutes later one of the group members inquired as to why there were empty tables that could not be connected or put together for a large group party. The response given was the manager did not like to do it that way. This is confusing to us. Within about 5 to 8 minutes of that inquiry two tables were connected at the back of the patio seating and we were all seated at that time. The waitress came over introduced herself gave everyone menus as expected. From then on the night just got longer and longer. Everyone was ready to order and finally the waitress returned to take the orders. The menu offered various items that appeal to just about everyone.  The variety on the menu was great. The wings were my favorite. We also had the calamari and the bruschetta. My husband does not usually like bruschetta but he found this version particularly satisfying. The prices on the menu appeared to be rather on the high side. However upon review to be rather on the high side.   Due to the food being excellent in quality and taste and the portions being large enough for two to share, this is the reason for the 3 star rating.  The waitress who was attending our large group of 12 was of sub par quality. When I asked for a large knife to be able to cut the goodbye cake. Within 5 minutes she came back and responded the manager does not like to give out the chef's knives to patrons. This again confused me. So I cut the large cake with a table butter knife.  I was very very disappointed with the service of the staff.    I will visit Oregano's again. However, I will visit a different location.",

    "text": "This review might seem unfair considering that we ate at this Oregano's just before going to Gabbage to see the fantastic musical performance of Mannheim Steamroller two days after Christmas, but my complaint spans several times visiting several different Oregano's in the Phoenix area.  I won't speak to the complaints of the quality of food or the lack of cleanliness at these restaurants ... although the negative reviews about these issues do give me pause. My main complaint is about the extremely loud, cacophonous noise emanating from the speakers all around the dining area.  For those who have never visited an Oregano's you'll want to know that your ears and brain will be assaulted by jazz so loud that conversation will be difficult.  Now, I know that music style is an acquired taste, and everyone is welcome to his or her personal opinion as to what they like. But, restaurants like Oregano's need to understand that jazz in particular is probably the most polarizing style of music out there.  You play classical music or soft rock and most people won't even really hear it ... they tune it out in favor of conversation or thinking or whatever they are there to do. You play jazz, however, and everyone will have an opinion about it ... they either love it or hate it. And truth be told, more people hate jazz than love it -- especially when blasted at full volume, making conversation difficult.  Does it really make sense for a restaurant to polarize it's customers that way? Personally, I don't get it. All I could think while there the other day was that I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible so my pulse and blood pressure could regulate itself back to normal. It was like I couldn't even breathe properly under the influence of that awful, discordant, melody-less noise.  Jazz proponents like to point out how beautiful jazz is because of its improvisational qualities. If you review \"Why I like jazz\" on Google you'll discover that most of the reasons revolve around the players, the culture and the history of jazz ... just the great feeling of how cool it is to be a fan of jazz. In other words, basically, jazz is just cool. However, those qualities don't make for a pleasant listening experience for a wide range of people who merely want a decent meal without having their senses assaulted.  Having said that, if a restaurant wants to be \"cool\" and cater only to those who like loud, obnoxious \"cool\" music it is their right to do that.  I'm just saying that if you want a pleasant, relaxing meal and don't wish to have your ears assaulted with cacophonous noise, Oregano's will not be the place for you to visit.",

    "text": "There is a great amount of effort that goes into eating at this particular Oregano's. First of all, arriving between the times of 430-6ish means you will be arriving near the time where there is limited parking space. I'm not sure how many people Oregano's seats, but it's 3x the amount of parking spots available.   Secondly, the wait time can be killer. They do not accept reservations so you can easily wait up to 45 minutes during a non-weekend dinner rush. It's up to you to bring a powerbar or a TIME magazine, luckily I live 1 block away so I can come by, write my name down and go back home to watch LEBRON JAMES manhandle Paul Pierce. Or you can wait around and hope they bring you out pizza samples while you wait, which they commonly do.  I did take my dad to this restaurant for his birthday. When we were all seated...my mom changed her mind and decided she did not like her seat....\"uhhh, excuse me waitress, my mom really doesn't like this seat...can we please move?\" Even though it was busy and crowded, no hesitancy, we got moved immediately. Definitely some solid service points with the staff. Despite the wait, the customer service here is impeccable, makes the wait time extremely tolerable.  So we built our own Stuffed Crust 12 inch pizza with mushrooms, chicken and jalapenos....which takes 45 minutes to make. 45 MINUTES! So, yeah that sounds like a long time and it is. But good food is not fast food, do not forget this. While we waited we ordered the large Big Beefstroni Salad, which came anchored down with a mix of shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, white cheese, tomatoes, spinach, Romaine lettuce and crispy sauteed sweet onions on top. And it comes with some bomb dressing (not ranch). Definitely enough to feed 3-4 people. Once we finished that up, our pizza was knocking down our stomachs. This was a massively deep pizza with cheese and sauce and toppings for days. The menus says that it's big enough to feed 4-6 people. Sometimes when I read that, I think to myself that's a lie. But not this time my hungry friends. 4-6 people actually means 4-6 people.   Oregano's, you have great dinners but you make me feel like a wood-legged pirate running a marathon...it takes me so long to finish with you, but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0....which is difficult to accomplish when you are so near to Mill Ave. So for this I thank you.  I do wish parking was better, I do wish that there was more variety on your menu and I do wish that your seating was more comfortable. I'm 6 ft 3 and when I sit in one of your booths, the table is nearly on level with my head. I feel like a child who needs a booster seat.",

The food was great as always, thin crust Chicago style square cut, great appetizer, etc. I don't really do Yelp reviews but thought it was key to point out how fantastic our waiter Sullivan was. It's so hard to find exceptional service these days, and he was as good of a server as I have encountered - even compared to the Ruth's Chris type restaurants of the world. He even brought us more soda in a to go cup when we were leaving - key when it's 108 degrees out.   Will make a point of coming here every time we are in Tempe, props to Sullivan for taking a pizza lunch to a different level.",

    "text": "I get the ambiance and could even buy into it, but I have to say that I am consistently unimpressed by Oregano's. The portions are huge and are almost good, but I find everything on the menu to be oversalted. Service is ALWAYS slow, there's ALWAYS a wait, and it's one of those creepy chains where all the employees look like they've had their smiles screwed onto their faces with a corporate power-drill. Someone's putting something in the Kool-Aid.  Every once in a while, I would get a craving for a salad or some pasta and I'd go in, but I have never been back to one since I was in this location one evening just before they closed. The servers were cleaning some booths as part of the end of their shift. A girl pulled the bench of one booth back and a grapefruit-sized clump of white maggots dropped to the floor, squirming everywhere. I have no idea what they were eating, but I have never seen that many maggots in one place, let alone in a clump like that. This, in itself, is horrifying enough.... however, what I found disturbing was that none of the servers seemed especially shocked or surprised. The manager came over and comped something off our bill, but the experience was truly horrifying.  I will not eat in any Oregano's again.... that level of filth is unacceptable in any food service establishment.",

The waitress didn't even acknowledge the wait time and really didn't check in other than quickly stating my food would be out \"in a minute\" 20 mins before it came out.

Nice big booths, which can fit large parties that normally would have to get split up or wait for a table to free up.  Their thin crust pizza is cracker thin - I couldn't decide if I liked the crust that thin...  We tried their: salad, pasta, pizza, and pazooki.   Pizza: numero uno..meh. their sproccoli was a bit more interesting. Can't remember which salad we got, but it was nicely dressed and had a lot going on. Their pasta (think we got the alfredo) - was also pretty tasty.   their drinks are the size of your head - if NYC's major saw the size of these glasses, him and his soda tax would have a field day.  Staff is young, probably all local college students, but all very friendly.  would i come back? yes - but there are just so many other restaurants to try first though in the area.",

Appetizers can at the same time our drinks did, including non-alcoholic. Everything was very very salty. For the main meal it was a disaster. The frys looked like they bought them at the store across the street. My pasta came out cold, I asked for it to be warmed up and when it came back it was so spicy my lips where burning and i couldn't even eat it. I didn't even say can you make it hotter, I said can you put this in the microwave for a little bit. Being a server my self, I felt really bad for the server because I felt like the kitchen just needed to get there shit together in the end.",

When we called to verify we had the right order they only responded with \"it comes with either shrimp or chicken\". However, when we ordered they did not specify nor ask which I wanted. On top of that, the menu clearly stated shrimp and did not offer a chicken option. They did not offer to replace it but instead transferred me multiple times to different people trying to make it our fault. This place is not cheap so the service should not be cheap either.

The patio was crowded and there was a 20-minute wait. The staff person managing the bar handled food and drinks. She was a pro. Very nice personality. The male customers were very complimentary to her. ;) As I said, she was very good at managing her station. You can see the line cooks. Ordered a diablo shrimp and pasta dish made with chipotle sauce. Very tasty although shrimp were over cooked. Entree came with garlic bread. It was good. Filling. A nearby table received one of their huge salads that could easily fill 2 or more people. Overall, I definitely recommend this spot. It has energy.

Once seated, service was fast and incredibly friendly.  Portions are huge and and flavors are divine.  The salad that came with our sandwich could have easily fed a family of four and our sandwich was completely loaded with meat; they definitely don't skimp.  $2.99 for a giant slice of cheese pizza and a larger sized kids drink was a great deal from the kids menu.  I would highly suggest the garlic bread appetizer and a mouth watering pan cookie for dessert.",

    "text": "After I smelled the aroma of spaghetti from a coworker's lunch last week, it's been on my mind and I have been CRAVING! I was looking for somewhere for pasta and my best friend recommended this place since it was close to where we wanted to stop by for dessert. I've only been to Oregnao's once, quite a bit ago, and I had a pasta bowl that was waaay to dry for my liking. I decided to give the company another try.  I ordered the bollo pasta.. if that was the correct name for it. It's just plain spaghetti. It came with angel hair and I didn't see any normal spaghetti pasta on the menu so I settled for it. My mistake because it really gives your pasta a different taste. It kinda mushed together in one bite and the texture was kind of off-putting. I ordered it with meat sauce and I literally got NO meat in my dish. Maybe like 4-6 pieces out of the ENTIRE portion that could feed 2-3 people. The sauce is completely chunky, meaning it was only really diced tomatoes (which is fine if you like that) but because of that, no sauce got on the rest of the angel hair, making the dish super dry. The tomatoes just stuck to chunks of angel hair. The dish was just CHUNKS of tomatoes and there was BARELY any sauce or meat! I felt pretty ripped off since I paid extra (granted it was like two bucks but I had to get more sauce because it was really just a chunky paste). Needless to say, my craving was never settled.   That makes 2/2 for a meh experience at Oregano's and I'll hit somewhere else for pasta from now on since I've given them two tries. Server was nice though (Kristen I believe). No complaints about their customer service. She was working hard as she looked like the only waitress in the section. She was still attentive and friendly to everyone despite how busy it was.   Also to add, the location was very small and kind of tight so you would entire from the front door, walk to the back OUT the restaurant to claim a table with a host, and go back inside the restaurant because it's pretty small.",

Delighted it is within walking distance when she starts school there this fall. Go Sum Devils!  We had pizza both times- deep dish and thin. Both were very tasty- love the tomato sauce! Nice salad. Enjoyed the outdoor seating, including outdoor heater in February and portable a/c in unseasonably hot April (maybe??). Yummy skillet cookie w ice cream too.  Really appreciate they give out water & little cheese pizza samples while wait for table. Highly recommend checking in on Yelp prior.  Only reason 4 star is both times our party of 2 seemed to wait much longer than larger tables in getting recognized by server. Actually flagged someone down after 10 mins to see if a server was assigned to our table",

However, the Tempe location on University was an entirely different experience. We ordered lasagna TO-GO last night, and frankly, it looked like one step above dog food. Burned on the bottom, soggy in the middle and one of the most unappealing meals I've ever seen. This meal that cost $20.08 per person (bruschetta & Lasagna) ended up where it should have been, in the trash! Disgusting that Oreganos would try to pass this crap off as food fit for humans!",

She redoes the pizza tells me 7 minutes and it takes over 15 and we are completely done eating. The icing on the cake was they still charged us for the pizza. Horrible..",

The pizza is always a go to at Oregano's and a small size is usually suffice for 2 people.   The salads are huge and for the price it's a great deal. I had it for dinner and there was enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I recommend the southwestern salad. Last time I asked the waiter to separate the dressing but the kitchen made the mistake of mixing it in the salad. The waiter was very accommodating and even offer a free dessert item to make up for their mistake.   I would give them another star but they dropped the ball again later that night. When my friend handed the waiter his credit card for his bill they somehow lost his card on the way to the register. I'm not sure how. Maybe it slipped out the book and someone picked it up because we wait an additional 10 minutes and it was nowhere to be found. Forgetting to separate the salad dressing was not a big issue but losing a credit card is dangerous.",

By no means am I an expert on authentic Italian food, but I am an expert on Customer Service, it's my field of work. The customer service at this location is great. I will say when I first attempted to visit here I wanted to call in my order, but I kept being told the wait would be over an hour or two. I finally got ahold of the manager and she made everything right and even treated me to lunch.   When I come in I feel like everyone is so happy and helpful. Also I don't even try to call my order in. I walk in and place my order and the wait is only about 10-15 min if even that long. The food is always hot and fresh.

You're just paying for the brand. The deep dish has crumbly crust and most of it was sauce, the thin crust is just like any other frozen thin crust pizza you can find in a store, unless you get a specialty pizza then you're getting some crazy concoction that seems like a stoner on 420 made it. If you like a full slice of tomato on your pizza then this is the place for you! I was just expecting so much more from how hyped up it was. Not bad but definitely not great, especially if you like real Chicago deep dish pizza",

I ve always gotten the bbq deep dish since forever. This is the only pizza, I get from Oregano's because is that good! I like this pizza so much that even once after waiting for 45 minutes I went to te restaurant to pick it up and it was  never processed and guess what? I waited another 45 minutes for my pizza! Today May 30th, 2018 I decided to treat some business associates to one of my favorite pizzas.. and what a disappointment.  Everything went wrong from the very beginning. I called to place my order and The lady that picked up the phone was rude to say the least, when I asked her for her name. She asked me to wait and put a male employee on the phone. I explained to the male employee the reason why I wanted a name because my order got missed before and ever since I always ask for a name to have as a reference, he kindly gave me his. As I said before I ve always gotten the same pizza and I know it takes 45 minutes to cook, I have even order this pizza for New Years dinner and I have never waited more than 50 minutes. The female employee told me to wait 1 hour and 30 minutes. Strange, but I assumed they were busy. Once I got to the restaurant that was not the case. The entire outside sitting area was empty, parking lot not even at a third of capacity and just a couple of tables inside were occupied. I am still trying to be positive and over come the wait time, the rudeness and the fact that I have to explain myself so much, I was focusing on my goal of offering my associates a great meal. One hour 30 minutes later around 1pm I show up in the restaurant to pick up my pizza and the cashier shows me a pizza drowned in bbq sauce that has nothing to do with the pizza I am used to getting. It was like if they had forgotten to add the chicken,onions and tomatoes and cheese that are always visible on the top. I mentioned to the cashier that the pizza looked different and told me thats the bbq chicken pizza: While she is handing me the box she says:\"oh, your pizza is not cut, is that okay?\" And I just looked at her and I told her :\"it's a pizza...could you please cut it?\" She rolled her eyes at me and she went to the kitchen, came back a few minutes later with the pizza cut very sloppy.  Then it came to the bill part. The difference btw my normal bill for the same order and the one for today was around $20. My total bill today for a 12\" bbq chicken pan pizza and an order of wings was $51.46 I have never paid that much!  I feel disrespected, mistreated, poorly served, embarrassed, overcharged and overall disappointed.  This used to be a great place with great food and great service. Somewhere down the line it all went completely wrong. I will not recommend again!",

It was only about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.  Enough for only one person but she knew all three of us were eating It.  Waitress was in outer space!!  Wish I remembered her name, but she's need to get out of waitressing and serving people.  Awful !!   I'd pass and skip this place in my opinion.",

We found seat at an outdoor bar area and ordered a drink. After we asked, the person taking care of our drink order said we could order food as long as we did not mind sitting where we were. This was fine with us. It is a large place with covered seating, but still a lot of the eating area is outside. I got the Coop De Ville Jumbo chicken parm. My wife got the King Parmesan Eggplant. Each item came on a bed of pasta of your choice and two pieces of baked garlic bread. The amount of food on each plate was tremendous. Everything was cooked and seasoned just right. Their sauce was not to heavy, not overly spiced and a very generous portion was given. We had a very positive experience from start to finish and would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Terrible experience at this particular Oreganos. We were greeted and sat quickly as there were only a handful of occupied tables between the dining area and outdoor patio area on this Saturday lunchtime. Placed our order as we told our server we wanted to start with a Big Beefstro salad as an appetizer and then have our entrees after. Placed our order and within minutes our entrees arrived (delivered by another server) and then a short time after our server came by with a puzzled look, (they didn't get their salad) and said nothing. We proceeded to eat what we could of our below standard for Oreganos entrees (bowl-o-pasta and shroom boom pasta). With half full plates the waiter proceeded to bring our bill, (with the big Beefstro salad that we never saw still on the bill) and never once asked if our meals were ok, if we needed drink refills, or if we would like boxes (luckily we didn't want the nasty leftovers) About 8-10 minutes later when he came for our payment, I told him that the salad that we never got was still on the bill, and he never once recognized anything about the MIA salad, and just said \"I'll take that off\". Oreganos is a favorite of our family in our city, and this store needs help. We were very disappointed paying the check at this location.",

Enough food to feed an army and I get to take a full plate home!? YES!  Combine that with the load of cheese sprinkled on top the pasta and salad, I'm pretty much in heaven!  The wait staff was nice too.  Why not 5 stars?  Parking is not great, it's always crowded and the service is on the slower side (probably due to the hoards of people here at lunchtime).  And also, my friend got the Big ol' Slice and I was very sad for her as the crust was so thin it was non-existent.  She left hungry but it was a relatively inexpensive meal as a whole.  Pizza slice $2.99 +.99 per topping; salad $2.79; Bollo Pasta $5.99 + .99 for meat sauce for EACH serving of pasta.   I'll be back to try other stuff on the lunch menu.",

    "text": "I live by here. This is my neighborhood Oregano's and it's the place that has put me off going to Oregano's as a chain. Just a chain of multiple bleah experience coupled with the kicker that made me stop coming here.  Small bad experiences 1) I order the Bollo Pasta. The noodles are literally mush. I ask for one that is less overcooked. This dish the noodles are literally almost a soup. I ask what they can do? They bring me another bowl. Come on. 2 mush bowls and you don't comp or do something better.  2) We had a group of 6 people - they don't seat us because all 6 aren't there. 5 of us are. They tell us to wait in the bar and once the last person in our group shows they'll seat us at a booth. A group of TWO people show up and because they are only 2, they seat them in the booth. Mind you with the 5 of us I said why can't we just be seated and last person can just squeeze in cuz there's room. Nope EVERYONE has to be there. 10 minutes after they seat those 2 people, 2 more people join them. So clearly you LIE to get seating here. Meanwhile we waited almost an hour.  And the final straw.  I order a chicken pizza. I take a bite and immediately notice something hard. It's an inch long chicken bone SLIVER. A BONE SLIVER. If I had swallowed I probably could've died. I tell the server and manager. What do they do? Comp my meal? No.  They offer me a free pizookie.  What. the. Hell. I didn't even order a pizookie. How is that a resolution.  So while Oregano's may want to legalize marinara or whatever b.s. slogan they have. I say Legalize Competency.",

Atmosphere had a good vibe with an assortment of music, and lots of neat design features.   We split a chicken Parmesan sandwich ($10) that was excellent: crispy chicken in a crusty bread, with savory marinara sauce and melted cheese. Accompanied by very good waffle fries and a unique olive & chipotle coleslaw. It was all very good and plenty for two.  Wine was only $5 a glass - and they actually listed the bar prices on the menu (what a concept)!  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I went here with a large group (6 adults and 6 kids).  We ordered the wings, the Big Beefstro salad, the Pizza cookie and 4 pies.  Three pies were thin crust and the fourth pie was Chicago styled pizza. The wings were the typical, but still good, wings you get in any decent pizza or bar.  The Big Beefstro salad was fantastic.  If you like a kick in your salad with hearty amounts of ribeye, I would highly recommend this.  It's the perfect mix of beef, sweet and spicy. The thin crust pizzas were terrific - crunchy and very flavorful.  However, the Chicago style pizza was undercooked; thus it was doughy.  And we lived in Chicago and know what decent Chicago style should be. The kids loved the Pizza cookie and devoured that in no time. I thought this was a great place to get good pie and hang out with a big group.  I would highly recommend this place.",

The Clark Street pizza was out of this world- a thin crust pizza loaded with sausage and pepperoni. The crust was perfect and paper thin. The sauce was good and the meat is everything that a grown man desires. We had the bistro salad that was oddly kind of spicy. Tossed in a sweet and spicy dressing that exceeded my expectations. Service was excellent.  Thank you Kelly! Try it! You won't be disappointed.",

We like it so much that we went back a week later, our last night in Tempe......the food was still good! The tall blonde bimbo server was another story. My daughter was a server so I am usually very nice and always tip 20%. We were seated, hardly got to open the menu and she asked if we were ready to order....no bimbo, we have not even looked yet!  We ordered drinks, they took quite sometime to come. We ordered, the food came fairly quickly . Then, Bimbo asked my husband if he wanted another beer, he politely says, yes. About 10 minutes passes, no beer, by then my wine was gone. We finally got her attention after about 20minutes to order my 2nd glass do wine and remind Miss Smarty Shorts that hubby was still waiting on a beer! Ugh! Need I say more....oh yeah, 15% tip, only because my hubby is a nice guy! Careful folks!",

The portions are huge and the prices are right and I can honestly say I've never not left Oregano's full and satisfied! Plus the atmosphere is fun as well. If you've saved room after your meal, try the pizookie, it's amazing. Giving 4 stars because there is always a huge wait and they don't take reservations or seat you until everyone is there, and also because the deep dish pizza was far too cheesy and saucy when I tried it (more than a deep dish should be) but everything else is superb.",

We then split the Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad and between the both of us couldn't finish it for fear we wouldn't be able to eat the small (8\") Pepperoni, Onion, and Roasted Red Pepper deep dish pizza that we ordered (brought home 2 slices). The spinach salad was outstanding and the Chicago style deep dish pizza was the best that I have ever had outside of Chicago! Props to our server as well as she took great care of us...and was funny and entertaining (not to mention, she was really cute too! Our Son missed out...haha).

I order this baby every time I come here. Other awesome thing about Oregano's is the beer selection and prices. Pitcher of Fat Tire for only $12? Sounds good to me! I am a big fan of their salads, when I used to eat meat their antipasto was amazing. Pizza is great great great. Thin and large! I like eating my pizza in square and mini-triangle end pieces. I always enjoy my meal at Oregano's. Some gripes include long waits, as the restaurants are rather small, and sometimes less than awesome service, but only sometimes. Oregano's is always a great spot to meet up for drinks and excellent food. I heard they are expanding the chain to other states, here's hoping SF gets one! I miss you Oregano's!!!",

    "text": "In short: Great pizza and Italian food, if you don't mind the crowd and waiting a bit.  I've been going here for the last 5 years, it's close by to my place so I usually just drop by in the off hours for a bite to eat.  It's pretty conveniently located near Mill and University, close by to all the bars at Mill.  The atmosphere is great, very relaxed and casual, without the usual pompous and fake Italian restaurant feel.  It is full of college kids most of the time, so atmosphere is a bit more lively than most other family restaurants.  You have the choice of sitting at the bar, inside booths or an outside table.  I like it outside as long as it's not in the summer, but they do have misters and shade so it's not all that bad.  Like some of the other reviewers noted, wait time can exceed even an hour around peak dinner and lunch times.  If you go off peak say around an hour after the usual lunch or dinner times, then you can get seated right away or maybe a 15 min wait at max.    The pizza is the best thing here, there's a bunch of choices or you can build your own.  I'm quite fond of the Frisco and the '45 minute wait' stuffed crust.  But I recommend having an appetizer or two before dinner, I love the wings (Wings of fire and Royal gold are the best) or the garlic bread.  Another good starter is the Beafstro salad but it's a humongous plate of beef and salad, the best of all worlds.  I also like their numerous sandwiches, and various pasta combinations.  Baked ziti is amazing and like pretty much every other item on the menu it's huge.  You should definitely top your experience off with a pazookie for dessert, it's absolutely delicious, I get one every time I go.  The prices are great too, their 18\" pizzas is about 20$ and it'll comfortably feed 2-4 depending on how hungry you are.  Also you can definitely share any of the other items, making this place a perfect place to have a very cozy and intimate meal.",

These restaurants are always very crowded with limited space. It's a fun place to eat though if you pick the right time. They have some good lunch specials and I enjoy their sandwiches (get them on focaccia!) and pastas. They have slices for lunch which are a great deal, very cheap and you won't have to wait an hour to eat pizza. For some reason I really like their side salad...it's definitely got more oomph than a normal side salad. Items I enjoy: *Guaca Tony: this is a great but filling appetizer, a huge bowl of guacamole with a giant large size pizza crust, yum!* Italian fried potatoes, AKA potato wedges: really yummy seasoned goodness, served with their sandwiches unless you upgrade to their sweet potato fries which pack quite the punch, sweet and very spicy* Mrs. Gibbilini's Spinach Salad: spinach, candied pecans, gorgonzola cheese, red peppers, bacon, mandarin oranges, and a unique asian dressing...very different flavor but I got hooked* dinner salad/side salad: spring mix, tomatoes, red onions, gorgonzola cheese, and the dressing of your choice...a light yummy salad to pair with your Italiano* sandwiches I enjoy are the Turkey Stuffed, Veggie Wedgie, and the Meatball Sandwich...again, you should really try these on their focaccia*the pesto penne bake: bread bowl with pasta in it! Yummy!*alfredo the dark: a spicy creamy alfredo type of pasta*THE PIZZA COOKIE:  1/2 pound cookie fresh baked covered in ice cream! Bring room for this baby!",

    "text": "I love Oregano's thin crust pizza. Although some of their pizza creations are a little too rich for me {ie:cheddar cheese and bacon} I like to stick with the plain old Numero One O on thin crust. The pastas are fantastic too, in particluar the Big Rig. But by far my favorite item is the Pablo Picasso salad. I actually crave it from time to time. Servers are always friendly and the place is clean, they obviously run a tight ship there and it shows. Great place to eat and fairly inexpensive.",

    "text": "I'm from L.A. and let me tell you something....we need an Oregano's out here. The place was great, the staff was running around with shirts that read \"LEGALIZE MARINARA\" on the back, we sat on the outside patio, the ambiance was great, a very up beat and happy place to be. This is no place for any Don to have a sit down at \"CAPISH\".I went there with a close friend and we started off with a beer and some Kick Butt Garlic Bread and let me tell you something the name suits it perfectly, a long piece of Italian bread smothered in garlic and tons of ooey gooey cheese, this was heaven. We ordered the El Picasso Chicago Style stuffed Pizza MAMA MIA, this was the best Pizza I have ever had, it was full of chicken and cheese, and all kinds of great stuff let me tell you, this was not dinner it was a life changing experience, I had no room for desert, as a matter of fact we boxed up 1/2 the pizza and took it to go, and that was only an 8 inch. This place is great, and thankfully for you out here in Phoenix they're scattered all over Phoenix, too bad they're not in L.A.",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite restaurants. I've eaten at the Tempe, Mesa, Old Town, and North Scottsdale locations and I've never been let down. The Tempe location was my first Oreganos experience and also the location I've been to the most. I have never had a bad meal at Oreganos and rarely had just ok meals. It literally has something everyone will like it just may take a few samples to get dialed in to your go to meal. The Pablo Picasso with chicken salad is my favorite salad that I have ever had and continues to be time and time again. The Big Rig Pasta with chicken is one of my favorite pastas anywhere as well. Both are slightly spicy but not to the point that it keeps my anti-spicy friends from enjoying it too. If I'm in a pizza mood a simple Oreganos thin crust pepperoni is delicious and always hits the spot! But my friends also rave about some of the more exotic pizza choices on the menu. Another friend favorite is the meatball sub which I've never heard a bad thing about. Finally, for dessert, the Pizza Cookie or Pizookie or whatever you call it is amazing! I am not a dessert person by any means but this thing is sooooo good! A perfectly slightly undercooked cookie topped with ice cream! Can't beat it! No matter how full you are from the enormous portions you can't leave without trying one of these masterpieces, you'll thank me after! Get one to share and it will disappear fast. I love the original chocolate chip cookie with vanilla but they also offer peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia. All my friends die for the white chocolate macadamia but I've never tried it because of my food allergy to macadamias. If you're thinking about eating here, go now!",

    "text": "The location is nice, just located south of oldtown Scottsdale. The food is decent, overpriced for what you are getting. The pizza is paper thin, I'd like to be full after I eat a pizza but this one leaves you hungry. Servers are friendly and generally are attentive but this place is way too overrated because of the food quality. It is good but not great and not deserving of 4 stars. Also, because of the font they use the menus are almost impossible to read in the dark.",

    "text": "I've been to several Oreganos over the last few years.  Since I live close to this one, it's become my go-to pizza place.  Every time I've gone, service has been excellent.  I usually get take out since waits on busy nights can be over an hour.  Parking can also be a pain.  The thin crust specialty pizzas they have are a tad salty but delicious.  The pan pizza also is quite good, although I wished they have the specialty pizzas offered for both thin and pan style crust.  Oreganos has also been the only place I've found in Phoenix that serves THE Chicago deep dish pizza-the one that's several inches thick from the cheese and other yummy fillings.  Not even the Unos on Mill had that.  It takes a bit longer, but totally worth it!  Portions are generous.  Good food & value.",
