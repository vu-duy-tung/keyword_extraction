    "text": "I wish I could give 4.5 stars. It's just shy of 5 stars due to infrequent issues that have happened. Overall - this is a great little sandwich place. The owner (Carole) is friendly, down to earth, cares about her customers.    She has come up with a unique type of sandwich you just have to try. It has interesting toasty bread and different fillings that one would not expect.  You don't just get a boring old turkey sandwich here.  My favorites are 1) the Zinger.  A breakfast sandwich with fluffy eggs, cheese, bacon bits, green onions and a zesty sauce. 2) I think it is #55 - a dessert sandwich with Nutella, bananas, peanut butter, and nuts. I also love their turkey sandwich but can't remember the number. I just know it has green apple on it and a tasty mustard sauce.  The other big pro for this place is these sandwiches aren't pricey.  They are very reasonably priced and most come with a side (either a salad or chips). The sides are also very tasty and unique. Even the potato salad side is twice as good (and different) than other potato salads.  Right now this store sits on Central south of Camelback but will be moving to just north of  Camelback soon. That is good - since parking at the current store is very tight. The new location will alleviate the parking issue.  If you are in the area, do yourself a favor and try this place. I found it from other Yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. I live in the north part of town, but make a point to get here at least once on the weekends. It's worth the trip!",

They make the sandwiches to order (expect a couple minutes wait) using a few simple but fresh ingredient combinations (ie. mozzarella, tomato, greens or egg, bacon, cheese, beans).  The owner is very friendly (and the other staff for that matter) and the place is always clean (why can't all other fast casual places do this?).  I do wish the sandwiches were just a little bit bigger though.  If you're looking for a unique 'sandwich' option give it a shot for breakfast or lunch.",

They chatted a moment with us about their options and top sellers.  They managed our order fabulously.  I got the #35, a fabulous SW potato salad, and a dessert sandwich with nutella and powdered sugar.  ALL, and I mean ALL, of it was fabulous.  #35 is like eating a burger, but not so awful for you, the SW potato salad is not spicy but has a SW flavor that is addictive, and the nutella sandwich was SO decadent. The biggest problem is due to all of the carbs/starches, I was SUPER full, so plan on taking some home if you are a light eater. BUT, it refrigerates and microwaves well at home. (At least the #35 did). :)  The restaurant is spotless, the hand washing station is magic, and I love the recycling section of the trash cans.   This place is officially in our lunchtime rotation and I am obsessed with how sweet the ladies are that work here, they are what make the place magical.  I will definitely be back for more.",

    "text": "You are now aware that Zookz makes uncrustables for grown-ups. And while you can't get a PB&J, they are delicious.   I must have stumbled upon a meeting of sorts during my first visit to Zookz. About six workers stopped, looked my way, and greeted me with huge smiles. I can tell when someone is faking it, and these grins sure were genuine!  I wanted the very best they had to offer, so without hesitation I went for their most popular lunch--turkey, bacon, avocado, and sweet mustard. It came with a tiny, but scrumptious side salad of kale, craisins, and walnuts. Delightful! Some say these are small, but this is a right-size lunch at a good price. Totally snagged a little jug of apple juice with my sandwich and dropped less than $9 for a satisfying meal.   A fair criticism to ding a star for is that it's not as flavorful as the ingredients would suggest. Rather than an eclectic sandwich, it almost tastes like the best grilled cheese you've had in your life. I would use less cheese and probably go for something sharper, just to let everything else shine.   Whoever writes the menu has some creativity and a keen palate for mixing flavors. If you're around CenPho and seeking a tasty, casual lunch, don't pass this place up!",

    "text": "A poached egg. That is what was at the center of this lunch, literally and figuratively. I went into Zookz for two reasons. 1. It's near my work and 2. every morning I pass it and it has this huge banner outside that reads \"Best Sandwich in Phoenix\". I'm not sure which of their sandwich's are the best. Unfortunately their lead sandwich, the #11 is not the best sandwich in Phoenix.   The sandwich is a panni-esk meal with two \"poached\" eggs, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and basil. When my sandwich arrived it looked like it was cooked in one of those sandwich makers someone gives you as a wedding gift. I opened it up to hoping to find two perfectly poached eggs bursting with yoke over some thick applewood smoked bacon and fresh tomatoes and basil. What I got were two incredibly hard boiled eggs, some bacon shavings, a very tart tomato along and some wilted basil.   The sandwich doesn't work. The problem is you can't poach an egg and then press it in a sandwichmaker and expect it to not come out overcooked.   Zookz gets two stars (Meh. I've experienced better) because the owner was terrific. She came out immediately and tried to explain to me that their egg cooker is set at five minutes (so its not really a poached egg) and that the eggs come that cooked. She said they would try to undercook the egg and hope that it worked with the press.   To their credit the second sandwich, though still over \"poached\" was better than the first. The owner was very kind and went as far as to reimburse me for my meal because it took about 20 minutes for me to finally eat. It was an underwhelming sandwich, great staff, but wrong concept. Overall it's kind of a hot mess, literally and figuratively.",

    "text": "Yesterday, we wanted to try something new for lunch..  We were in the mood for a good salad and my friend did a search and Zooks was on the list.  We headed over and in my mind knowing where this was located, I dreaded the parking situation I was going to find.  Luckily, the parking wasn't bad because we went at 1pm, but we did get the last spot that we had to squeeze into.  A truck would never fit.  Anyway, we walked in and the atmosphere is pretty fresh and clean with bright colors and images of fresh veggies adorning the walls.  Pretty nice.   When you walk up to the counter, a pretty nice guy greeted us and asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he explained the menu to us.  We went right for the salads, even though some of the sandwich options looked pretty good. I got the #5 and an iced tea.    We took our seats and one thing that stuck us as a little odd was that the AC system was over the windows but the air was so forceful it didn't matter where you sat in the dinning area, you were going to be blasted.  Not a huge deal, but it was noticeable.  It's Arizona and it's hot, so I guess we should be thankful.    Once we got our meal, it came in a plastic to-go container.  One thing I might recommend to them is using something less environmentally unfriendly and costly for people who are dinning in.  I mean it seems very \"pre-packaged\" and not to mention it's totally crappy for the environment, but I digress.... The salad was full of wonderful ingredients, crumbled bacon, roasted almonds, dried cranberries, apples, carrots, and Zookz Creamy Apple Mustard Dressing.  It was so good, it left me wanting more.  (Meaning it was great, but it have had more to it or at leas greens at least.  They should bottle that dressing for sure, though because it was awesome!   This is a great place to grab lunch so check them out.  I think I definitely want to try a sandwich next time.  Maybe split it with my friend and have the salad again too.  I hope to see them fix the way they package their salads so when you dine-in you aren't getting it in a to-go container. Heck, it's going to save them money in the long run anyway.",

Got the Kale and the Chickpea, both were pretty good. Would recommend the chickpea. Got the number 10 and 20. $18   My take on it was just a different version of a grilled cheese. The contraption they use is pretty cool. I'm glad they didn't use the basic white bread I remember having when I was young. It's a bit of an upgrade I'd say.  Would I come back? Probably not, when I think of a good sandwich, the bread is my deal breaker. Cool concept if you love grilled cheeses. Just didn't tickle my fancy.",

Sandwiches are these warm, toasty, flavorful rounds of goodness! They have the best potato salad in the world, the chickpea salad is to die for and I have yet to try a sandwich I don't love. The owner is also super sweet she comes around the tables to make sure everyone is doing okay.   Zooks is a must try!",

I typically get the zinger which has poached eggs, cheddar, green onion, bacon and zinger sauce. However, they recently added the 60 which has Apple pulled pork, Cole slaw and Monterrey jack cheese and it's a new favorite as well. I also like their kale salad and pomegranate green tea a lot. They keep the restaurant really clean and the manager is super friendly and cares about her customers. All around a great establishment.",

Nonetheless, i was skeptical about how this encounter would go and asked if she had gone before and what the deal was. She said it was The best but another nameless rideshare company wouldn't help her out with the whole journey. We ordered pickup from her house and then cruised, 10 minutes tops on a Friday during lunch. The counter person was extremely friendly, helpful, and compassionate. The owner greeted the woman and they discussed her love of the restaurant at length. The space itself is quaint and has the coolest door in the world. I loved the selection, menu, and overall atmosphere. The sandwich itself is like a empanada made out of bread. The bread is pressed in a panini manner. Served hot. After the transaction was completed, she asked if i could take her home. At a stop light she begged me to take a bite of her sandwich and we ended up sharing our #24 and #25 in the car. It was a truly beautiful sandwich. I wouldn't have found it wasn't for this nice ole lady.  I guess i need to bring someone here and repay the favor to appease the sandwich gods.",

And now every single issues Zooks may ever have had are gone as they moved around the corner to Uptown Plaza and everything is a zillion times better.  Check out their extended hours ( don't forget one of the best Breakfast in town) but now they cater ! Zooks is owned by locals and I feel very strongly that we all should shop and eat in our neighborhood, not in some distant chain owned restaurant.

    "text": "One day, after scouring Yelp for a breakfast spot loved by all I stumbled upon Zookz Sandwiches, a central Phoenix, family owned shop specializing in crafting circular sandwiches. After visiting a few times and receiving consistent service I have been a regular, visiting once every two or three weeks, just enough for the small group of employees to remember my name and order. The menu is fairly simple with no more than two dozen sandwich choices for their breakfast and lunch menus, which is served all-day. Identified solely by numbers the ordering is a little unique. When placing an order the number gets written on a small brown bag, similar to a pastry bag, and handed off to the back. Remaining loyal to my 44, partially due to the cheaper price, I've never been disappointed. Frittata eggs, bacon, ham, basil, red peppers, and feta cheese are all toasted to perfection in a special apparatus used to craft the pockets. After placing your order at the till, you are given a number and choose a seat, where an employee will deliver your order to you. Their sandwiches are delivered on long rectangular trays, a little odd, and inside that brown bag from earlier is your sandwich on a round paper plate holding the halves together. As you wait for your meal or eat away, employees coming around to wipe free tables or tend to the floor strike up conversation and make sure you enjoy your visit. Their customer service is genuine, the conversation flows organically and never seems forced. When you walk in you are greeted by a smiling face and a genuine hello, typically from the owner.   The concept of a circular, panini like, sandwich was introduced to the owner by her grandmother while she lived back in Egypt. The modifications her grandmother made to recreate them for her grandchildren became entrenched in the owner's childhood and eventually the motivation to begin this shop here in Phoenix. They offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches, with breakfast sandwiches priced at $5.95 and lunch sandwiches are around $7.95 although they are the same small size. This is the only downfall, the relatively high price of a full meal with sides, as they cost just as much as the lunch sandwich options. It's only due to the excessively large drinks, either a choice herbal tea or soft drink my breakfast choice can get me full. They also offer a few alcoholic drinks like five-dollar mimosas and some local beers, a plus to them, but I've yet to try any to really share an opinion on whether this seemingly low price is a good deal or speaks to the quality of the drinks.   They do tend to get pretty packed in the mornings and lunch time, as they are located in a high-traffic area but there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. With small two-person free standing tables, a long cushioned bench along one wall, a larger table along another side, and individual seating neat the door they've got you covered. These wooden tables and the bright yellow and gray themed decor and intimate feel inside fits well into the somewhat posh area. A sweet touch is the large mural of the owner's grandmother that runs along one wall. I assume due to them being in central Phoenix their hours are more catered to accommodate a typical 9-to-5 worker's schedule, making it the perfect breakfast and lunch spot. However, their hours from 7am-4pm, have been another downside for me, as I can hardly find the time to make it in, during their slower times. All-in-all Zookz is definitely worth a try, their friendly service and unique product will leave you wanting more.",

After ordering, we grabbed a table outside under the misters and noshed on a coconut/oatmeal cookie for our appetizer.  Breakfast was delivered quickly and was packaged picnic-style.  The outer layer of these sandwiches is intriguing,.....sealed all around and crisp.  The insides contained poached egg, cream cheese, and a host of delicious options.  Our menu selections had been recommended by the staff and we enjoyed them.  I took half home for the next day's lunch.  The sides were all interesting...Nephew got the potato salad and declared it delicious.  The cookie was really yummy as well.  Niece and I had coffee which was excellent too.  The price was reasonable...I fed 6 people for $55 and we all left satisfied.  All in all, it was a nice outing and a great get-together.",

    "text": "My wife and I were checking out eating places we haven't been to for lunch and came upon this hidden, one of a kind sandwich restaurant.  We went in because of the mouthwatering pictures on the billboard just outside the front door. The outdoor seating looked like a fun place to catch some rays and enjoy our lunch.  Upon arrival the outside tables and tables inside restaurant were clutter free and the restaurant was very clean. We were greeted by the Owner, Carol, and she welcomed us with a big hello. She was very helpful in explaining all of the sandwiches and asked us what we liked and then guided us to specific flavors and toppings that we might like. I had the #50. It was awesome. The capers, olive, tomato and the artichoke tapenade really married with the mozzarella cheese and ham. The crispy crust on bread was flakey like a empenada. So different and one of a kind, than any sandwich on this continent. Carol designed and Patent the sandwich press to be just hers. It was designed after her grandmothers cooking vessel from South Africa, where she got the idea from grandma's breakfast she always was served. My wife had #44. I tried the sandwich and was in heaven. The eggs frittata were perfectly cooked, moist and super flavorful. The roasted peppers and cheeses blended together with the bacon, basil and ham. My wife didnt want the feta and substituted cheddar instead. Carol explained, we will make whatever you want. She was so awesome and friendly. The cashier was super too. Very helpful in describing what ingredients were in food. The potato salad is crazy good!!! Wasn't real sure by looking at it, corn and black beans in it, but it is my new favorite potato salad. This place is so different, you have to try it. Cant compare this type of sandwich to anyone. One of a kind. Very creative. Carol does it right. By the way, for dessert we got a treat. Carol made us #55. A great way to finish lunch. Warm Peanut butter, Nutella, bananas, and roasted almonds. Very sinful. Not being a big dessert type guy, all I could say was, oh my God. Chef John's Stamp of approval. Definitely will be back soon. If you go, tell Carol, John and Linda recommended trying Zookz.",

    "text": "We live in Medlock district, within walking distant to Zookz.  Watched it come up and intended to give it a try early on but didn't.  One Sunday morn, on a walk with my older girl and with the baby in her mei tai, I realized they would be open by the time we finished.  When I arrived they had JUST opened for the day.  I was a sweaty mess and dragging my girls in.  The owner Carole was working and she was a VERY gracious host.  Explained the concept, asks us to make adjustments as desired and mentioned the kale & mandarin orange salad that is given with catering orders when I inquired for my office.  I got a few sandwiches to go so hubby and son could try them out as well.  She packed everything nicely for my walk home, poured the drink for me AND tossed in a sample of the salad.  BTW: Kale isn't high on my 'delish' meter.  However, this is now my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SALAD hands down.  I actually drool at little whenever I think about it (darn it, there I go again...).  We have now gone a few more times and each sandwich has been warm, moist, toasty, crisp, flavorful and so wonderful it makes my husband smile to think about it.  One of our top 5 eateries and I personally LOVE her backstory (check out the About portion of their website).  Start-up businesses are rough.  We have a lot of great local-owned food establishments in the valley.   I truly wish her the best.  She's got a few more fans and regular customers from my house!",

Each time I've been here I've been greeted pleasantly by both the owner and staff. My first visit, the staff was in the middle of changing shifts and my food took a little longer than usual. The owner recognized this without me saying anything and brought a free dessert. She even stopped by up make sure I enjoyed everything. My second visit the store was actually closed, but both the staff and owner were more than willing to still take my order. The owner even wiped our table off before I ate because she noticed the recent storm had blown dust on the table just minutes beforehand. It's service like this that really makes this place shine and coupled with the delicious sandwiches will keep me coming back!",

I ordered a #45 (Very similar to a caprese style sandwich), all the ingredients were put into a pita style bread, it didn't taste like pita, it tasted like bread if that makes sense.  Then the sandwich was pressed and heated. It was very tasty. My only complaint is that it was a little small. I easily finished it, and I rarely finish my food.  They have several sides to choose from, she gave me two so I could try them both. One was the kale salad the other was a chickpea salad... both were super flavorful. In fact, I next time I might see if they will put the chickpea salad in the bread and grill that up! Obviously, I plan on going back =)",

The sandwiches all come with your choice of three side salads, but the sandwiches themselves are definitely filling enough. I also noticed you can get craft beer for only $3.75!  We each got the No. 44, which is basically a caprese sandwich. It definitely wasn't the best one I've ever had, but it was still really good! I think what I didn't like was that the cheese wasn't melty and the sandwich wasn't that hot, which is more of a personal opinion :) And their bread is amazing!

When you're waiting for your order read the story behind the business, it is very inspiring.   I tend to avoid dairy and the number 10 with the cheese held is pretty dang great for others that are lactose intolerant. My husband gets the one with horseradish and potato every time and graciously allows me a few bites.   I ten to normally gravitate towards greens/very healthy sides, but here I LOVE the garbanzo side salad. Each lunch sandwich comes with your choice of side so that's always great.   The star of the show is of course the sandwiches. The way they are crisped is to perfection. The ice coffee is pretty dang great too. For those needing to avoid gluten, they offer gluten free bread for a few dollars more. Not sure if they use a different toasting mechanism for those with Celiac Disease.   The space is a happy spot that is very clean (another huge plus in my book). Couldn't recommend this place more! Support a locally owned business and come here!",

Imagine someone took two not very sweet pancakes (more on the savory side) and crimped them together and stuffed them with fresh sandwich ingredients; that's kind of what it's like.  I had the No. 10.  I didn't carry for the almonds, but that's just a personal preference (again I accidentally ordered the wrong one).  The turkey however seemed fresh and wasn't dry and all the flavors worked well together.  It takes some time getting used to the whole pancake like bread thing.  I would have liked if it came with a side of fries, but they do offer salad or chips that comes with the meal.  All-in-all, I would try it again just to see what it's like fresh.  If you're ordering to-go you may want to look at other options, unless it's really close by.",

Their sandwiches are round and toasted to perfection to where the cheese melts throughout the sandwich.  All lunch sandwiches include a side salad which was the perfect amount to compliment the sandwich. I choose to try the Garbanzo bean salad which was delicious.   The service and seating was superb! After you order you sit down and they bring you your meal. They have an open air concept with indoor and outdoor seating with misters. I had a great meal and experience and will be looking forward to my next sandwich here!",

I also appreciated how the owner came out and spoke with customers, many who were trying her sandwiches for the first time. I suggest that everyone give this creative endeavor a try--they're yummy!

Everything is made into these wonderful little sandwiches and it follows the recent trend of counter service with a flair. Although I cant recall the name of the exact breakfast sandwich I had consumed, I can tell you that it was delicious! The restaurant itself is both cute and quaint being tucked into the easternmost portion of Uptown Mall.   Twyla and I opted for the Mimosas which were a little top heavy in O.J. My first comment was that if they were going use a disposable glass for the drink, at least get something that Champagne would be served in. A 5oz squat plastic cup was not the ticket for me and really retracted from the experience of drinking a Mimosa. Additionally, If your operation does not have a dishwasher, there are ways to give your customers a more upscale feel without tapping into your profitability too heavily. I'm sure that they do not pour hundreds of these per day. Is the \"Dollar Store\" ringing a bell.   Our patio location was very enjoyable and ambiance was great for our breakfast. All of the staff that we had encountered were super nice and very helpful. Don't worry Zookz, We'll be back to see you but I'm going to ask what glass my Mimosa is coming in or I'll bring my own disposable...  #Irishcatv2 #vino2 #Vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

Depending on the mood I am in, I get the #55 - nutella, bananas, peanut butter with powdered sugar or the #11 with poached eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, tomatoes and fresh basil. I am sure if I would deviate from my favorites, it would still be good. Two sandwiches and two drinks will set you back about $16 or $17. They are extra fast bringing orders out.

The kale along with the mandarin oranges and they dressing was so delicious! I would definitely come back here to just eat the salad. The sandwiches all came with either chips or small salad.

Egg, roast beef, spaghetti, berries, apple pie, or what have you. Zookz have capitalized on the idea and have turned it into a thriving business, and their sandwiches are top notch.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The service is fast and friendly at Zookz, and they're simplified the process so that you'll have a sammie in hand shortly after ordering at the counter. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The sandwiches at Zookz aren't huge, but they're priced affordably, and my #22 breakfast sandwich with egg, ham, black beans, and chipotle sauce came to only $6.50, which was a great price point. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  As others have stated, the bread is what really makes the difference here. I don't know whether they add some spices to the mix or what, but I could have eaten the bread plain. From there, the fillings in my breakfast sandwich came together nicely into what was a good sandwich, although I'll note that my sandwich was seriously lacking in the ham department. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I've known of camp pies for decades now, but I'm thrilled that someone has made a great business out of it. I'd gladly come here daily. Star Granted.",

She talked about how those sandwiches came to be and about how this new location was working wonders.   The food is excellent! My sandwich had green Chile and macaroni on it (it was a special that day). And holy hand grenades it was amazing! So warm and toasty, spicy but not hot, and made with love.   I chose to have the side kale salad with my sandwich as well. I didn't think I liked kale but gosh d*rn it was really good! It had this tangy vinaigrette on it and came with mandarin slices. I give it an excellent out of 10!   I just wish the sandwhich was a little bigger. But other than that this place is great and I will be back soon!",

But, on to what I'm actually here for, I really liked the food! I got number 35 and my bro got 20. Next time, I'd probably get number 20 because the horseradish sauce on number 35 was a little too strong, and overpowered the rest of the flavor that I otherwise could've enjoyed. I don't count that against them because it was my choice on the sandwich. I tried some of number 20 and my mind was blown! It was so good! My mom also got number 20 with ham instead of turkey. From the circle-sandwiches to the sunflowers, this place was awesome!",

    "text": "LUNCH OUTTING.   I've been driving past this place since I moved here April 3rd and finally stopped in....   I am now kicking myself for waiting a month before I was introduced to coolest places for sandwiches.   We first walked in around 1145am and it was too crowded but we had to wait in a small line. My friend and I l we discussing to each other what we were going to order. As we wakes up the lady at the counter was already on top of our order from hearing us and wrote down a 15 and a 20 on our bags. we then proceeded to talk to my friend about the 15 and how they tried it with a new ingredient recently which enhanced the sandwich. At that point I asked the lady if this was her shop. She told me it was hers and that they would love to hear our feed back with any suggestion on sandwiches and ingredients.she always gave us her recommendation on which side was her favorite and the most popular. (the sandwich comes with a side or a bag of chips).   I ordered the turkey with avocado and bacon and a spicy Dijon sauce. My side was the garbanzo bean salad. We sat down at the table and the owner delivered our food herself. The sandwich came out pressed, toasted, and eye popping. My mouth began to salivate immediately!!    The sandwich was as delicious as it looked. crispy from the toasted bread. smokey from the bacon. creamy from the avocado. spicy from the mustard.  would I go back?  Verdict: ABSOLUTELY!   let me mention it was impressive to get such personal service from the owner of the business. she was attentive, helpful, inclusive, and genuine. you don't get service like this very often from the proprietor very often. the price was appropriate and the service was above and beyond excellent.",

The kale salad is extraordinary - now don't go making a face at the word \"kale\" - this is not your mother's kale, nor her kale salad. It is delicious & doesn't taste or feel at all like an obligatory, virtuous but hard to swallow dish. If there is enough salad, you can request a large size to take home & impress your family.   And if you like chocolate, the brownies are excellent.  Now is the time to start enjoying the patio out front.",

This is one of my new go-tos on Fridays and I will definitely be in again and again.",

Always good to support local small businesses.  The menu isn't too large but you can customize your sandwiches. I tried to have my sandwich with chipotle sauce instead of mustard, and it even said it on the bag, but i definitely still got mustard, or their chipotle sauce tastes exactly like mustard....   The sandwich was pretty good. A little small and the flavors are kind of all blended together which is a little different, but good. They have Tim's chips which are amazing (try the sour cream chips) and the price is reasonable, although if you are really hungry this is probably not going to be a place to order just one sandwich.  I appreciate the owner's dedication and effort in a tough area (near the light rail in north central phoenix), but I worry about the ability to run a successful business there. I think a place like this would do amazing in old town or PV or near ASU. Probably even in growing rural parts of Chandler and Gilbert. It's got a tough battle being located where it is, mainly because of the lack of foot or car traffic. I hope they do or that they move somewhere closer to me because I did like the place.  I will definitely stop by here again if I am in that area and I wish this place the best, thanks again.",

Try the #20 on the menu, their most popular sandwich.  If you've been stuck out in the burbs of Phoenix, now is the time to support the small establishments that have cropped up in the central corridor area of downtown Phx.  A great place to try out some awesome sandwiches, either breakfast or lunch. They have outdoor seating, but the parking is on the short side, so do this...............get there early on a Sunday morning, bring your fave electronic gadget or NYTimes, and enjoy the kind of weather other parts of the country will only see in 2 months............",

Wow!! I have been hooked ever since and absolutely adore the curried turkey sandwich with kale salad. Alone or together these elements are outstanding!! Truly delicious with a wonderful melange of ingredients and a mild curry sauce. I like really hot curry but this subtle sauce works well for a general palate. The physical space is light and airy and the outdoor seats are nice. The place is always spotless (including the restroom.) This locally-owned eatery should be a must go-to place on a foodie's list. The pastry of the \"sandwich\" is neither heavy nor greasy and provides a nice crunch to the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and support a local business and enjoy some tasty food.",

I had the Turkey, bacon, avocado (sorry, I can't remember the number!) and my boyfriend had the #22 breakfast sandwich. Both were delicious. I wish we would have split our sandwiches instead of both eating our own! For sides, we had the potato salad and garbanzo bean salad, both were great. They had a slight lemon zest flavor which was a nice touch. The owner stopped by to check on us and she was very friendly. The lack of parking doesn't bother me because we walked from my apartment and it is walking distance from the light rail. Overall, we will be returning and recommending Zooks!",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend as we were driving up Central Avenue looking for a place for brunch. It's perfect if you're looking for a relaxing, tasty experience that won't be expensive. They serve sandwiches for breakfast and lunch with fantastic side dishes. My favorite sandwich is the one with ham, brie, apricot jam, and almonds! I have been back multiple times and I have never had something I did not like. The absolute best thing there is the kale salad, which seems crazy I know, but they dress it up so well that the kale is soft and sweet. I could eat multiple bowls of it in one sitting (this coming from someone who despises kale in most settings.) The owner always comes to check on how we liked everything and sometimes brings us the sandwiches when they're ready. They have a nice patio with outdoor seating and the front of the store opens up so everyone can enjoy the morning breeze. Overall this place consistently provides delicious food and awesome service!",

We are very happy that we did - actually, we were so happy that we went back 3 times in 1 week! The sandwiches are very unique and there are a good number of variations to try. The Kale salad is also very good and is a nice and healthy accompaniment.  I also recommend trying the \"carrot\" cake which the owner told us is not made with carrots at all, but actually beets. It is really delicious.  Not too sweet and just the right amount of frosting!  The owner is quite friendly as well and you can tell that she really cares about the quality of her food and providing a positive experience for her customers.  Overall, I'd say that Zookz is a fantastic new addition to the Central Phoenix area when you are in the mood for a tasty sandwich for breakfast or lunch at a very reasonable price.",

The sandwiches themselves are awesome. Perfect crunchiness every bite but never burnt.  My wife had her favourite, curry turkey (no 15), and it was just as good the first time we came by. I had the poached egg and bacon (no 22), which was good, but I probably should have gone with a lunch sandwich given the time of day. Every item on the menu has been an explosion of savoury delight. This is our favourite sandwich place in the valley.",

You wouldn't believe how many restaurants can screw up a poached egg, but Zookz is great. Oh, and the potato salad was superb. My husband is not a potato salad fan and he loved it. The Owner was so nice-very engaging with all of the customers, helped with setting a highchair at our table for our baby boy, and made sure we knew about the specials available. All in all great food and service. We will be back!",

    "text": "I live in San Franciso and was visiting mom in Phoenix, when two of my mother's friends turned us on to Zookz for sandwiches.    My mother and I have lived all over the world and we really appreciate a good meal and yes, and it takes a little to surprise us -but Zookz did in a very delicious way.     Zookz sandwiches are indeed unique/cutting edge and incredibly flavorful.  We had #30 and #45 - we split them so that we could each try two, additionally, the kale salad was tender and flavorful.  (Despite the amazing nutritional properties of kale, I am only a kale fan if it's tender,  doesn't have a real strong kale flavor and is tasty - this salad met all of those requirements :)) Last but far from least was Zookz chocolate dessert. It was truly an after thought as I really didn't think a \"sandwich nook\" would have an exceptional dessert in their \"to go\" refregerated case; however, my mother who has a real sweet tooth insisted on splitting a dessert :)   I am a True chocoholic - very selective - I went in for that first bite with an average expectation and wow!  My mother and I were competing for the finish :)  Carol, the owner, came up and introduced herself while we were trying to decide on what to order.  We peppered her with questions on sandwiches as well as Zookz origination, given we just read the history of Zookz on the wall which begged more questions... We found out that Carol too has had the fortunate history of living abroad along with a real passion for baking and cooking.  Prior to starting Zookz, Carol made and distributed a number of her own receipes, including homemade sauces which she incorporates into her sandwiches.  Carol is a True inspiration starting Zookz after the age of 50.  She is an energetic, very attractive businesswoman who has created a unique and delicious sandwich not just to Phoenix but the United States - I have never had anything like it!  I look forward to returning on my next visit,  tasting several more sandwiches along with another chocolate dessert :)!!!",

(the size of a appetizer paper plate)  But it was REALLY, REALLY good and filling!  There are no bread choices- it's sorta the 'Hot Pocket' concept, but fresh and round.   I wasn't offered any side choices other than the kale salad which was really good.  It was a bit soggy n the middle when I got back to work.  Had I eaten in, rather than to go, it would have been perfect.  This is not a buy the sandwhich and put it in the fridge until lunch kinda place.  I will definitely go back and eat in or within a few minutes.   I hope they make it!!!!",

    "text": "I'm in my first trimester of my pregnancy and woke up craving a breakfast sandwich. I found this place online and after seeing the pictures of the sandwiches I had to go. Ive been extremely nauseous this pregnancy and I hardly enjoy my food as much as I normally do, but I remained optimistic... It was raining today so, my fiance and I dressed our two toddlers in some warm clothes and headed out. When we got there the parking was sparse, but luckily we found a spot right in front of the restaurant. When we got out of the car I noticed the place was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but I liked that there was a nice, large sliding glass door which was opened. I liked that there was a good amount of seating outside as well. When we walked towards the register we were greeted by a very kind and friendly lady. I let her know it was a first time there and she seemed very happy to help us. She told us about their most popular sandwiches and kindly recommended the sandwich with nutella, banana and almonds for our children. My fiance ordered The Zinger which was amazing according to him and that's a huge compliment because with his father being an impeccable cook, he is all about quality and taste when it comes to his food. I'm not sure if my sandwich had a name, but it had turkey ,bacon, avocado and honey mustard I believe. I asked for the mustard on the side, because I wasn't sure if my unborn baby would take to it. The woman who took our order told me a side was included with my order and showed me to their refrigerator which had a few health conscious options. I decided on the garbanzo bean salad and she kindly handed me her kale and tangerine salad as well. I enjoyed both sides. My family and I sat outside since the rain had died down and enjoyed the fresh air. The woman who took our order also took our food to us outside while we were all taste testing the sides. My sandwich was amazing, my children's sandwich was amazing and the pomegranate green tea I ordered with my sandwich was VERY good. The woman came outside to check on us and to also let us know they will be moving down the street to the plaza with AJ's Fine Foods by the end of December because they are aware of the parking issue. I think with the food being so good they've outgrown their space. I had a very good overall experience  and will be visiting them at their new location in the near future!! I have not had many GREAT experiences with food in the last 3 months, but this was definitely one of them!",

There are so many things to like, but the reason they only get 4 stars is they have a pretty limited menu, so you may not be able to find something for everyone to enjoy.  I walked in expecting a sandwich slapped together on two pieces of bread. The sandwich I received was far beyond this. I ordered a sandwich with poached eggs, avocado, and cheese. The sandwich reminded me of a toasted uncrustable, except with eggs and cheese instead of PB&J (but they have that if thats your kinda thing). Although, the bread is definitely not white bread -- it is more of a pot pie, uncrustable, sandwich, with breakfast on it. The poached egg was fantastic -- perfectly cooked! I 100% ordering a breakfast sandwich. They know how to cook an egg.  The atmosphere -- Its in a great location. They have a dog friendly patio and the inside is trendy. Service was quick and they were friendly. Nothing to brag or rag on.  I definitely suggest a visit to Zookz -- It is an out-of-the-box sandwich shop that's a perfect spot for brunch.",

If you have a hard time looking for it just turn into the big plaza on central and camelback.   The interior is set up for a small-mediumish occupancy. You order food at the counter and they bring it to you. The open windows and large glass panel door is a really nice touch as it lets the sun in and brigthens up the dark wood/industrial interior.   I ordered the #33 adding avocado and chicken. Be aware that the sandwiches are quite small, one would probably easily in the palm of an adult's hand. But they are packed to the brim with their fresh ingredients and are quite filling.   The one thing I was really looking forward to was their poached eggs they put in the sandwich and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. It was a soft deliciously poached egg smack inside of a toasted sandwich. I'm not sure how they actually put the poached egg in there to be honest. I wish the yolk inside would've been runny but I can imagine it'd make the sandwiches a lot messier.  Although the ingredients inside the sandwich were terrific I really disliked the bread they used. I'm not sure what it was but it felt like toasted plain white wonderbread brushed with olive oil. It tasted flimsy with little substance and I found myself wanting to skip the bread and just eat the insides. I wish they used bread that was a bit better and more substantial but overall this is a great spot to get a quick bite to eat.",

I ordered the #35 and my wife got the #20. The sandwiches are small, but are delicious. The flavors complimented each other in a great way. To top off our experience, we splurged for the prickly pear tea and pomegranate green tea which were both delicious as well. I would have given it 5 stars, but the service wasn't that great as I think they were trying to close up for the day, but it wasn't bad enough to make us not come back again.   Definitely recommended!!!",

The exterior is very inviting with a large bouquet of fresh sunflowers that match the bright yellow covered outdoor seating area. The interior is an open space with some bench style seating and private tables offering warm and fluffy pillows to make you feel at home. The menu is great, offering a plethora of rounded toasted breakfast and lunch sandwiches, in addition to healthy salads and juices.  I opted for the \"Zinger\" #66 which is crusted toasted bread pocket filled with poached eggs, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, bacon, and green onions, topped with a Zinger cream cheese sauce. So YUMMY! The lovely woman at the register was a ray of sunshine!! She was very welcoming when I walked in, offered to go through the menu of the most popular items and then gave me a free kale salad on the side -also delicious! I will be stopping back for sure!!!",

I had the #20, and yes, $8.75 is pretty pricey for a fancy sandwich, but it was pretty darn tasty; good combination of turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and cheddar cheese. I didn't love the mustard sauce at first, but it didn't really take away from the flavor. These aren't traditional sandwiches; they were sort of pressed and oddly shaped, but it's good if you're looking for something a little different.",

    "text": "Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I have had a lot of breakfast sandwiches in my short lifetime so far. I would say by far this is one of the top 5 breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. It is not at all what I expected and the value for these sandwiches is fantastic. As a Arizona chain, I hope they continue to expand and bring zookz up to the PNW ASAP.   We came on a Saturday around lunch and I was expecting Zookz to be pretty busy and overwhelming. They had one or two customers in line, but the wait was not long. It only took about 10-15 minutes to order and get our food. The restaurant itself reminds me of southern california. It is open with patio seating and quaint tables that optimize the cozy restaurant space. The bar area had little hooks in front of your seat to hang coats and bags which I found very convenient and the chairs and stools were all quite comfortable (yes I tested multiple seats before deciding on a table).   The menu has a good variety of breakfast and other sandwich items. They also have a full-service espresso and coffee selection which is very appealing and more than I had expected. My friend ordered the No 66 and I ordered the No 22 (see pictures for menu). I also ordered a cappuccino. As they were order and sit, they give you a number and bring the food and drinks to you. As previously mentioned the food came in an extremely timely manner. The sandwiches were fresh and hot - I think I burned my face a little on my first bite. The bread outside is not quite like bread, but not quite tortilla either - it is like a crispy thin hybrid cooked to perfection. They invented their own sandwich press that seals in the sides much like a calzone (without the braiding) and keeps the runny egg yokes from spilling directly in a sad mess on your plate. The eggs themselves were poached to perfection and the rest of the ingredients were generous and proportionately placed. Overall, my sandwich was more than fantastic. It was still busy, but definitely a contained delicious mess that was well worth it. The value was also good at 6.25 a sandwich it was afforable and worth it. The cappuccino is the reason they are given 4 stars. It was bitter and tasted funny, perhaps because of standard water used. There was not much foam and it was a bit cold when it arrived.  However, overall, this was a great experience. I would likely recommend the breakfast sandwiches. They are AMAZING, but I look forward to trying all the other sandwiches at future Arizona visits. A must have while in the area if you are into breakfast or sandwiches or both of these things!",

We also got a complimentary sandwich stuffed with warm and rich Nutella, bananas, and nuts. Come here if you're tired of trying Einstein bagels or average breakfast sandwiches. Price is worth it. I spend 16$ on two orders of sandwiches and a side of potatoes. That's about average of what is spent at any sandwich spot for two.

I really love the founder's story of how she began to make these sandwiches and where her inspiration comes from.   If you haven't been to Zookz, let me explain why it's so special.   The founder created a special sandwich press that perfectly toasts a round, crustless sandwich filled with delicious items of your choosing. They have a number of amazing combinations - both sweet and savory, breakfast or lunch options.   I love the menu items with eggs in them, and I LOVE the nutella one, too. Favorites are No. 22,  No. 10, No. 7, and No. 55.   No. 22 2 Poached Eggs, bacon, ham, cheddar cheese, black beans, avocado, zookz Chipotle Sauce  No. 10 Thinly sliced Turkey, crunchy apples, tangy parmesan cheese, cranberries, almonds, zookz Sweet Heat Mustard Sauce  No. 7 (Salad) Kale, shredded carrots, crushed pineapple, coconut, roasted almonds, and zookz voodoo dressing.  No. 55 Peanut butter, nutella, bananas, roasted almonds, and powder sugar  Don't stop at the sandwiches - the side salads are wonderful, too (like No. 7, above)!",

    "text": "So after reading all of the reviews and seeing the delectable pictures of the sandwiches here, I just had to try this place out. I happened to be in the area, so lucky me.  I was impressed by the store front. Very modern, with large open windows and this really cool, big glass door. I can see this place great as a spot to work at.  I got 2  breakfast sandwiches. I don't remember the numbers though. One was their classic one made of poached egg, bacon, basil, and cream cheese. The other was made as a frittata with red peppers, bacon, ham, and Chipotle cream.  They were definitely stuffed and I loved the crispy bread. But with the rave reviews, I was expecting more. I feel like flavor was lacking and I find myself sad after eating it. I make breakfast sandwiches that are so tasty and I wasted my appetite on something less than expected.  While the sandwiches weren't bad, I will just find myself somewhere else for breakfast.",

    "text": "I've been to this place more times than I can count. I usually try to come here on the weekends for a quick brunch after Zumba or before doing errands. If you haven't been here, you are missing out.  Where do I even begin?! This place is a quick, to-go breakfast & lunch sandwich place. Personally, I love breakfast sandwiches, especially if they are quick, cheap, and amazing! You get all of that plus more at Zookz. My personal faves for the breakfast are the No.11 and No.66. Both are oozing with flavor. For lunch, my go-to is the No.10. I didn't think I'd like the sweet mustard with the apples + cranberries combination, but to my surprise, this one hit the spot. Other times, I just stick to the 11 and 66 because who doesn't like breakfast at any other time of the day? Aside from the sandwiches, this place has killer potato salad.  Inside, there's corn, black beans, green onions, and more. You'll have to try it yourself.   The service here is superb (hi, Adrianna!). Because of coming here so many times, I see how consistent the service AND the food are, which both keep me coming back. The ambiance of the place is SO cute and charming. The yellow color scheme makes the place feel vibrant and fresh. The owner is awesome too! Even when it's busy, she tries to walk around and address customers inside.  The parking is shared with many other places in this area, right in front of the entrance and on the sides. I haven't had much of an issue with this. They're usually open 7am-4pm... although I do wish they were open later (breakfast for dinner is one of my faves).   Overall, if you're looking for a quick breakfast, whether you want to sit inside with a date, group, or by yourself, or just a quick pick-me-up, Zookz is definitely worth the try.",

The zook was nice and toasty without being greasy. My wife got the NO. 20 and was raving about hers as well.  The chipotle potato salad was light and tasty, we devoured them in just minutes as we were waiting on the sandwiches.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, we will definitely make the trek from Chandler just to come here.",

I'd read a few reviews prior to going so I was expecting to be little disappointed in the size of the sandwiches but not the quality. And that was True.  Greeted so kindly by a host at the door (which is an old garage door, very cool) with a menu and suggestions for what to order at lunch, I knew the place was so hip and cool. The guy at the counter greeted me and again helped me order a sandwich with plenty of helpful suggestions. I ordered thier most poplar sandwich, #25. Anything with turkey and avacado is my weakness. I grabbed bag of chips and paid like $8 for it. The register girl complimented me on literally everything I was wearing. Um, hello new best friend.  The sandwich was hand delivered to me and was so delish. They're more like sandwich pockets. We used to make the same things as a kid but put pizza in them. Just take 2 slices of bread, add your ingredients in the middle, take a circle cookie cutter to punch it out. Then Glaze it with butter or something and bake in the oven. Zooks did the same thing but way better. Was I sad to see the sandwich was so small? Yes, I was. But was I pleased with the shredded turkey, avacado, tomato, and spicy mustard... you betcha.  I'd give Zooks a 4 but I wasn't exceptionally im pressed with the interior or seating arrangement of the place. But don't get me wrong, it's still really good!",

The location is really cute and I loved the decor. Service incredibly friendly and attentive. They asked how I heard of them and I told them how I heard through my friend (they immediately knew who I was talking about). I really enjoyed the feel in Zookz. You can tell it is a small, locally-owned business that treats their employees right.  The food: I got #20 with the potato salad (and a soda, because their cups were cute. I'm weird). My friend got #25 with the kale salad. I'm forgetting what exactly was in mine... I think turkey, avocado, cheese, and tomatoes... but it was delicious! I was really impressed with the bread, which was crispy and light but with great flavor. My sandwich + soda was ~$9. Pretty good price for a locally owned small business.  I highly recommend Zookz to anyone who is in Phoenix (or even by making a trip out there for those of us who live in N. Scottsdale). I've already told all of my friends about Zookz, and I can't wait until I can go back!",

Me & my coworker ordered a #20 (turkey, bacon, avocado,  tomatoes & cheese, sounds delish I thought) & I got  the kale salad...we got it to go because I work way too far for for my 1hr lunch.  I got to my desk and to my surprise they're was no avocado in my sandwich :( & I love avocado!! I thought they just maybe had my order wrong but as I moved on to my other half there was one tiny piece in there. My coworker had the same issue.  Also the edges on their sandwiches are really hard. But honestly that's just a nitpicking complaint.  So the kale salad was really flavorful if you like greens, their green tea is pretty good. & I give the sandwich I got a 6/10. I'd try this place again but I'll ask for extra avocado even if I have to pay for it. (Which I shouldn't have to since it should be already in there, but whatevs)",

The way the sandwiches look reminded me of the frozen PB & J's we used to get in school. It's sealed along the sides and stuffed with goodness. Loved it! The place itself is small but they do also have outdoor seating. The customer service was great! Also, if you check-in while you're there, they offer a 10% discount!

    "text": "My coworkers and I came in here for lunch today. We got in at about noon... It was busy but not overly crowded for it being prime lunch hour.  I ordered the Number 45 (caprese sandwich) and they both had the turkey, bacon, avocado. All sandwiches come with a side of either potato salad, chickpea salad, kale salad or chips. I also ordered a large iced tea. They have an awesome selection of freshly brewed tea. I did think it was unusual that iced tea was about a dollar more expensive than the fountain drinks (in the same size.) Not a fan of that.. but it is unlimited refills on all drinks so I will let it slide. All in all my sandwich, side, and iced tea rang up to about $13.  The sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch. The panini press makes them into cute little pockets that don't leave you feeling too full. Overall I enjoyed my sandwich, but it was just your typical caprese panini. Nothing to make it out of the ordinary. I didn't really enjoy their take on potato salad. It is more like mashed potatoes with black beans and corn. It was pretty bland even with the chipotle and my coworkers and I had to season with salt and pepper. I think I would go with the kale salad or chips next time! We enjoyed our lunch! I am not sure Zookz will be at the top of my list, but it was still a nice lunch spot.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful. We made small talk while I ordered and she helped me choose a delicious sandwich (the No. 10, more on that in a second). The other patrons were also friendly. I live in Southern California now, this is rare and special. There was also plenty of seating, with options to sit inside or outside, on stools, chairs, or a cute cushioned bench with throw pillows.   The coffee is out on the counter where I could get my fill and mentally prepare/caffeinate myself for the day. My sandwich was a perfect, toasted, sweet and savory hug from the inside. There was turkey, almonds, cranberries, and apples on it.   Thanks, Zookz! See ya next time I'm in town!",

I ordered the roast beef horseradish sandwich, I think the #35, with the garbanzo beans salad.  The food was all lacking basic seasoning, needed more salt.  There was very little roast beef, and what was  there tasted like a cheap supermarket slice.  There was at least twice as much potato in the sandwich than meat.  The quantity of food for the $9 wasn't horrible, but felt like less than what it should be.  The bread was tough and almost flavorless.    I was expecting much more given the reviews.  If they address the shortcomings, this could be a special place.  For now, it is just \"meh\".",

Today I made my first visit in and was impressed by the variety as well as the layout and locations of the menus. Makes it very easy for someone to decide what they want. I mainly chose to come in based on knowing a side salad is included with the lunch portion. However it's very easy to get confused when the signage reads \"your choice of one of our homemade side salads\".  When ordering I chose a salad from the board, which is apparently not protocol. \"It sounds like you haven't been here before. You choose one from the cooler and give it to me and I put it in the bag\" I was told. In a slight sense of confusion and shock I had to leave the counter from ordering to select a salad, none of which were labeled at the chiller aside from \"contains nuts\" on the lid. It was unclear to tell what was what so I grabbed something that was green. While I do enjoy the food just a few words have put a \"bad taste in my mouth\".",

I got the 66 breakfast sandwich with the gluten free bread, and my fiance got the 20 sandwich with the garbanzo salad as a side. Everything was AMAZING! Seriously so full of flavor.

I asked for my sandwich w/o tomatoes and it was delivered to me with tomatoes so my husband took it back for me to get it fixed. It wasn't a big deal, I'm a picky eater and used to my food not coming out to me the way I ordered it, plus the food didn't take long to cook.   While we waited a woman came out, I think the owner, and apologized and offered dessert to us dessert on the house. She made us this delicious peanut butter, banana and  Nutella sandwich, so good!!  Overall, the food was really good but the 5 stars is for the service. I used to work for a well-known foodie deli in Ann Arbor, Mi (Zingerman's), where not only was I taught to appreciate food but also the value and importance of great service. If we made a mistake, we went the extra mile to fix it. Even though I wasn't upset about the mistake, I REALLY appreciate that they went above and beyond to make up for it. This is part of the reason eating at local, small businesses rock!",

    "text": "I enjoyed Zookz sandwiches quite a bit.  Their breakfast sandwiches in particular, as I'd pick one up before work.  No more.  I learned a dirty little secret.  Their bread is delivered and stored outside their back door on the ground.  Yep.  On the ground.  They keep it outside for several hours while they are open and could possibly move it indoors.  Aside from the obvious, they're located in the same complex as a large condo building, one that's dog-friendly, and has lots of pets.  So, the next time you have a Zookz sandwich, check to see if there is perhaps a little extra flavor to the bread.  Shame on you Zookz.  Change your ways.",

I had the# 35, roast beef with horseradish and dad had the #25, ham and cheese with many delicious things. both were great, but we agreed that the roast beef was the better of the two. It's all about the horseradish!Each sandwich comes with either a salad or chips, we had the kale salad, it was pretty good. The owner came out to chat with us for a bit; it's exciting to talk to passionate people, and she is passionate about her business and the concept. Over all, we were very satisfied. It's worth getting off the highway for some True local flavor and to support a local business. Google maps navigated us there perfectly,.",

I'm a regular, going once every week and a half or so.  90% of the time I order a #22.  Most of them know me by name, and know I'm going to order a #22.  I'm convinced this is the best sandwich in Arizona.  I want them to name it after me.  I'd have the best sandwich in the state named after me.  It's perfect for breakfast, lunch, or brunch.  Filling, crispy, but not too heavy.  Cures a hangover too.  It's magic.  Every visitor I fly out to Phoenix, friends and family alike, I take to Zookz while they're here.  Every time they're back in town they beg me to go back.  Every single person I've brought here.  I've even flown a #22 2000 miles across the country, just so my friend could have another one.  It wasn't soggy either.  Like I said, those things are magic.  Conveniently located near the light rail too, on the Central corridor.",

As we were eating she brought us out a complementary kale salad which was very good. I didn't realize they had coffee when I ordered so I asked for a coffee instead of my drink and she gave me my coffee for free! Awesome place, awesome service, awesome food.",

After driving around the other day in circles in the dreaded \"Where should we gooooo\", I finally took a sharp turn and ended up here.   They serve breakfast all day and lunch comes with a side salad. I tried a number 30 (ham with brie, apricot spread, and almond) while the sis had a breakfast hot pocket, I mean sandwich. I opted for the garbanzo bean salad with feta. It was tasty, but I asked for an extra lemon to kick it up a notch. The kale salad also looked pretty tasty. While we were eating, I leaned over and said, \"It's like eating an adult Hot Pocket!\" She totally agreed. I mean really, you have crispy, hot french bread (almost croissant like), filled with various forms of meat and cheeses, served hot.   For both Zookz', a medium drink, my included side salad, plus an extra 10% for checking in, it was less than $14. Not too shabby for lunch in Cen Pho. I definitely want to come back and explore the menu more, especially their frittata breakfast sandwich and whatever one mentioned Nutella.",

I really wasn't expecting much as sandwiches are typically pretty straight forward.   We walked up to order and I saw they had breakfast sandwiches, I asked if they sold breakfast all day since an egg sandwich sounded really good. They said that they usually only serve breakfast in the morning, but will check to see if they would do it for me anyway, I said \"No prob, I'll just order from the lunch menu.\" as I didn't want to be a pain. They checked with the kitchen anyway and said it would be no problem to make a breakfast sandwich. I asked for mine with no parmesan as I can't eat cow's milk. The chef then came out and asked if I would like anything else in replacement, I told her I couldn't eat cow's milk dairy, so she then offered to give me goat cheese instead. How cool is that? I try not to be a pain with my dietary issues, but they went above and beyond with their service and to accommodate me.  As for the food; my sandwich was really tasty, eggs were cooked right with fresh spinach and tomatoes, and the bread was nice and crusty, and it had extra goodness due to the added goat cheese.   My husband had the turkey avocado, I tried a bite and it was equally as good as my sandwich. The sweet mustard dressing was a really good addition. His also came with a kale salad which was as good as the sandwiches.  I would highly recommend Zookz and will definitely be back!",

Great people, great atmosphere, unique delicious sandwiches. I highly recommend this place. My favorites- for breakfast #66 and for lunch #60 (But others good too).",

I wasn't familiar with the menu or what exactly the sandwiches were all about.  I ordered the most popular breakfast sandwich, and it was very yummy.  I ordered a coffee which was also very tasty.  I liked the whole backstory that's on a big sign on the wall.  I love that it's all inspired by her grandmother and the amazing travels she would go on.  The decor is very cute and cozy and I wish I had the time to sit in there.  I'm almost never early enough to work to have the time to stop in, but I hope this place does a lot of business.",

    "text": "Came here today for the first time with coworkers as it's super close to our office. My husband has raved about it so I had to bring friends to try it out!   We ordered a variety of different sandwiches - both lunch and breakfast sammies - and we all enjoyed what we ordered. I got the curried turkey sandwich and side kale salad. The real star here is the customer service and friendly staff. The owner came out to personally ask if we enjoyed our meals and offered to replace the sandwich, no questions asked, if we were unsatisfied. They were super fresh and delicious! I also really liked the kale salad.   The only thing I would agree with about other reviewers is that the portions are not huge. In many ways this is great, and I left feeling satisfied, but I was STARVING in about 2 hours. I think many local places overserve you and Zookz does not. I would have probably had room for dessert. However, the prices are fantastic.   I can't say enough pleasant things about the customer service and that will bring me back for another lunch experience. Next on my list is the ham sandwich with black beans and chipotle sauce...yum!",

    "text": "Zookz wasn't even on my gastronomic radar as I was driving south on Central Avenue on my way to Burton Barr Library around lunch time today.  However, it was the first restaurant on Yelp's list as I searched on my phone.  I caught a glimpse of it as I drove by to my right and immediately took the first right to circle back to it.   Very friendly staff is what greeted me upon walking in.  They could sense immediately it was my first because I most likely gave an impression of a Golden Retriever puppy that walked into the neighbor's house: confused, lost and maybe a little intimidated due to unfamiliarity.  The staff eased me in however and made me feel at home within moments, explaining what they offer and serve.  I asked what their recommendations were and both gladly obliged.  Tara (I didn't get her name but calling her that because she looks like the young Tara Reid) chose No 11; while Guy (just because he was a guy) picked No 45. Both choices looked equally appetizing based on the ingredients' description from the overhead menu, but I was leaning towards No 11 because it was Tara's choice plus it had cream cheese which we both like.   As Tara was taking my order, Guy threw in a last-second recommendation - No 25 - which he said I could customize by adding cream cheese (yay Tara) and bacon.  I decided to sit outside on the patio so I could enjoy this fantastic weather and have a chance to observe the surroundings.  Soon after, my order was brought to my table, enclosed in the paper bag Tara had written my order on.  Taking the sandwich out of the bag, the aroma alone whetted my appetite even more, but I was a little disappointed because a wall picture inside had me visualizing a more substantial delight.  I stared at it for a few seconds as I struggled to mentally grasp what I was looking at because it looked like two slightly larger dollar-sized pancakes fused together in a panini fashion. Nonetheless, my first bite could not have prepared me for the explosion of flavors in my mouth; all the ingredients popped and the flavors blended well together with every bite.  The consistency of the sandwich was toasted/baked/paninied (however they made it) perfectly.  It was crusty on the edges but soft and gooey in the middle.  As unsubstantial as I thought it was, I took my time relishing it anyway because the place invited me to just relax and to enjoy the moment.  The head cook/chef perhaps owner even took the time to check on each customer which added to the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.    Overall, it was a worthwhile snappy decision to choose this place and I'll definitely be back.  P.S.  Owners of Zookz, give Tara and Guy raises because those two were excellent wait/counter staff.  They were both helpful, engaging and definitely knew what the cafe had to offer.  One last thing, can I get Tara's number?  ;)",

All fresh ingredients and the taste definitely shines through. Easily a 5star place based on atmosphere, friendliness and taste. Thank you Zookz, a True Diamond in the rough!!!

However the main thing I want to comment on today is their customer service. This place has the best customer service!! I've been eating at their store for years as well as ordering through delivery providers. Today Uber eats cancelled my order for no reason and I called the restaurant to find out why that had happened. Someone answered and hung up, I was so upset I called back a few times till the phone was answered and was asked to be put on hold. I said no I had a question, I wanted to know if they cancelled my order or ubereats did. The girl said they were very busy however my food was prepared and there. Anyway after contacting ubereats I reordered still a little upset with the exchange because it was so out of the ordinary for zookz. THEN a few minutes later I received a call from the restaurant again, they apologized profusely and explained they were so busy earlier but really wanted to take a moment to call me back and say sorry and explain what had happened, and to let me know they had remade the sandwiches fresh for me.  I think this kind of customer service is so amazing! Thank you zookz!!",

Can't beat the cheddar cheese with the bacon and poached eggs!   No.10: This is typically not the kind of sandwich I get but I was pleasantly surprised. The turkey, sliced apples, cranberries and almonds were a great mix. This is definitely one of the healthier options. I love the sweet mustard sauce they here.  No.60: We all enjoyed this one. The apple cider pulled pork was tender and the coleslaw was delicious.  I am not usually a fan of kale but their kale salad is good (No.9). My absolute favorite at Zookz is their potato salad.

The potato salad was great too, it has corn (for a touch of sweetness), black beans, and green onions. This looked weird but when I took a bite it reminds me of regular potato salad. So over all I would give this place another go soon.",

They have this cool contraption that makes the sandwiches and they end up a circular shape.  I got the no. 11 sandwich.  It was one of the breakfast sandwiches with 2 poached eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, basil, and cream cheese for $5.75, very delicious.   I love how all the flavors just mesh well together and the touch of basil really gives it a good kick.  The amount of cheese was just right.  The service was great and it is in a big plaza, so parking will not be an issue! Great sandwich place!",

The story on how Zookz was created was on the wall and tables which was nice to touch to learn about. Carol, the owner, was so pleasant and truly doing her part to make sure everything was running smoothly and personally ensuring that the customers were happy.  I was starving so I grabbed a garbanzo salad from their grab and go fridge and ordered a number 20. I had every intention of eating a little bit of the salad while I waited and saving the rest for later. Yeah, that totally didn't happen. I ended up eating the whole dang thing. The sandwich was delicious as well. I can't wait to try more flavors. I also split a nutella peanut butter sandwich as a dessert. Can you talk about heavenly?!   I will definitely be back.... often..",

But because our hotel didn't offer a typical free breakfast that most hotels provide these days, we checked Yelp for a local affordable establishment.  That's how we found Zookz.  It was affordable ($) but held 4.5 stars.  So, off we went.  Lorrenna took care of us and made great recommendations. OMG, round toasted breakfast sandwich were so delicious that both my husband and I found ourselves making all kinds of noises while we were eating because it was so yummy.  The bread was perfectly toasty on the outside.  The eggs and other ingredients on the inside was perfect. The staff said we need to come back because their lunch sandwiches are even better.    And, because we mentioned we found Zookz on Yelps we received a 10 percent off their already inexpensive price (Breakfast sandwich was less than $6).  Good thing we don't live locally or we will be here every day!!  While you're hear, be sure to read the origin of Zookz! We'll definitely be back before departing Phoenix.",

It was a good call; he devoured his and I ate almost all of mine.   The price was about $8.50 a sandwich, not bad at all but I would have rather not had the price of the side dish built in, as I didn't like any of the choices- kale salad/potato & black bean salad/garbanzo bean& corn salad. We went with the potato but it wasn't good.   We will definitely be back to try the breakfast options (served all day!) and one of the dessert sandwiches also.",

I had a pulled pork sandwich, which came on panini type of bread despite my being told the sandwiches were on French bread - maybe they have a very skinny French chef. :) Snark aside, it was toasty and tasty. I took a citrus-kale salad from the fridge as my side dish, and was not disappointed. The issue of value is not so much the price, around $10 each, as the size. Both my son (I forget what he had) and I came away feeling more hungry than we expected. But our taste buds were entertained, as this was not a cookie-cutter kind of sandwich shop.",

    "text": "On our way up to Sedona for the holiday weekend, my wife and I did a quick pit stop at Zookz as we were driving out of town. We got there pretty early - around 10 AM - so the restaurant was pretty empty, and Carole (the owner) was working the register herself. She's very friendly, and she brought out our sandwiches once they were done. The interior itself is pretty much what you would expect for a fast-casual spot, but you can also read the story of how Zookz came to be on the wall next to the television - a very interesting and cool background!  As for the sandwiches - it's really well-done, particularly the crisp on the outside of the bread, and it definitely fills you up...you can fit a lot of stuff into those pockets! I ended up going with one of their breakfast sandwiches that had typical breakfast foods (egg, bacon, avocado) and topped off with some sriracha-infused sour cream (I think) that made it a properly fusion breakfast sandwich. My wife went with No. 25 - more of a lunch offering perhaps, but it also has black beans, avocado, and definitely more of a Mexican bent. The ham in particularly was quite juicy, providing a nice contrast to the crunch and crisp of the bread. We got a small side salad (corns and black beans being the base), which was pretty much in-line with the Mexican-inspired theme that the breakfast sandwiches take.  Overall - a really delicious meal at great prices. You'll definitely come away from here filled, and I really do wish there were more stores selling jaffles (which seems to be the name used in most other ex-British colonies, according to trusty Internet research). Although the sandwich may be unique, the fillings fit right in, and it's hard to go wrong with any of the choices offered. If I'm back in Phoenix anytime soon, I'll definitely be swinging by here for a meal!",

    "text": "So I used to cater from this place before she moved into this new location across the street. My guys used to complain that the sandwiches weren't big enough so I usually ordered 1 1/2 - 2 sandwiches per person, problem solved, the sandwiches were $5.75/$5.95 each so it wasn't a huge price to incur when you're simply feeding a lunch meeting.  Now I decided to take my son in for 2 sandwiches (because I KNOW one isn't going to fill him up, he's a teen and they're always ready to inhale everything after school). Imagine my surprise when I see she's increased her prices to $8.50 a sandwich, same flavors, same size just MORE money. So for 3 almost hot pocket sized sandwiches, a bag of chips and 2 small..and I mean small side salads the total was $27 and that's with NO DRINKS.  I'm sorry but it appears that she moved into other new snazzy location in the AJ's lot and is passing the cost on to her customers. Good sandwich, and I mean just good..nothing spectacular or extraordinary but for $27 I can walk around the the walkway to AJ's and buy a pound of their finest ham, a loaf of their gourmet, fresh baked bread and some imported cheese and go home and make 8 toasted sandwiches and still have money left over for a couple cookies to eat afterwards.  Shame because there were already complaints of the sizes of her sandwiches for the price when they were cheaper but now at this rate, she won't be in that corner long.",

Zookz is by far my new favorite place to go. The employees are very nice and helpful, the place is very modern and inviting. The food was not what I was expecting. I honestly don't know how to describe it but the sandwiches are similar to paninis but not similar at all.. take my word for it, this place is worth the extra cash! I will definitely be coming back and bringing my friends!!",

    "text": "It physically pains me to write this review. I've been wanting to try Zookz for years but didn't see many vegetarian sandwiches and when I discovered I'm gluten intolerant I put Zookz out of my mind. Luckily I saw on Facebook a couple of months ago that Zookz now has gluten free bread AND from my favorite bakery, Gluten Free Creations.  My husband picked up Zookz yesterday so we could have for dinner. I got the No. 40 which I've had twice before on gluten free bread, they even write \"gf\" on it. I don't know what went wrong yesterday, but OH BOY!!!! I ate half the sandwich last night around 7:00 and by 1:00 am I was writhing in pain. Anyone who has gluten sensitivities know exactly what I mean. I am positive the bread was gluten free, but Zookz does not have a gluten free kitchen nor do they claim to have one. I believe cross contamination occurred at some point.  I enjoy Zookz. The owner is super nice and actually cares about her business and customers which is why I'm saddened that I can no longer eat there. My husband has no gluten issues so he'll be back.",

The food was really good but the kale salad was amazing. I would stop by just for the salad alone. I am a diabetic and this meal really agreed with me. No spikes or crashes witch says a lot about the quality. For drinks I had a delish pomegranate ice tea and husband had a fountain cola. He would of loved to see a root beer. That was the only thing missing for his drink but they do have many other choices. We will be back!",

My husband and I shared #20: thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado and tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, Zookz sweet heat mustard sauce. The sandwich comes with a side of your choice (kale salad, potato salad or garbanzo bean salad) and a drink. We picked the garbanzo as a side and pomegranate iced tea. The sandwich came out hot and toasty and the first bite I had was pretty tasty! They bake their bread in a special cylindrical pan so every bite had a lot of flavor and it was so crispy! I love cheesy crispy bread! Reminds of me grilled cheese sandwiches but better! The garbanzo beans was also a good choice! I choose this side because it was different. I've had many kale & potato salads before so thought giving garbanzo salad a try and it was very good. I actually want to try making this at home. The pomegranate ice tea was a refreshing choice and just what we needed since it was so HOT today! While we were eating, the owner also came up to us and asked us how everything was and was really sweet.  We really enjoyed everything we ordered here and definitely want to go back to try some of their other sandwiches especially their breakfast ones!",

I've had the No. 33 Breakfast Sandwich (2 Poached Eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach,tomatoes and fresh basil), and the No. 45 Lunch Sandwich (Fresh Mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, basil and arugula, Zookz Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette)  The bread I would describe as a croissant type texture, with a pita pocket shape. It's super yummy, and not as carb-loading as a normal sandwich bun would be. If you are really hungry, I would suggest getting a side salad along with your sandwich.   The price point is low, around $5 for the breakfast sandwich, and $7 for lunch.  Their catering is great, it came with labeled boxes, a sign that had the description of every sandwich, and 2 large side salads. Really organized, and a quick clean up.  If you go into their restaurant, you can get in and out quickly, the food comes out fast.  Overall, wonderful, affordable sandwich shop with a little twist! It's definitely a good break from your normal Potbellys, or Jimmy Johns.",

She was so helpful in explaining her menu and being hospitable. She even brought our table a free dessert which was amazing and I now unfortunately will not be able to go back without getting one in the future! Go here! You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Our intention was to go to Mazie's next door, but there was a 30 minute wait so we decided to give Zookz a try and we are so glad we did!     I'm not exactly sure how to describe their sandwich:  a round panini,? a round grilled cheese sandwich with other stuff in it, or as they say \"a warmly toasted, round and sealed sandwich?   However you describe it -- it is fabulous!  My adventurous hubby tried the No. 15 Thinly sliced turkey, dried cranberries, shredded carrots, roasted almonds and a mild curry sauce.   My adventurous 12 year old son tried the No. 45 Fresh Mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh spinach, roasted red peppers and fresh basil with honey Balsamic Vinaigrette.  And, I, probably the least adventurous on this day, ordered the No. 20 Thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar and Sweet Heat Mustard Sauce ( I was told it was the most popular sandwich ordered).  All three  of us tried each others sandwich by proclaimed our respective sandwich the best.  The sandwiches are served with a little side of Kale salad.    Price point for sandwiches is around $5.75  They do serve breakfast sandwiches as well, which we plan to try!  Operational Notes:  Hopefully you are enticed enough to give them a try, but beware of their hours - M- F 7am - 3:30pm (they aren't open in the evening).  I believe they are closed on Saturdays (that seemed like an odd decision), but they are open on Sunday's (which is the day we happily came across them).   The interior is cute, and they have outdoor patio seating.  Staff is super friendly as noted on other reviews.  No alcohol is served, but who needs the alcohol... will only numb your tastebud's from savoring those flavorful sandwiches!",

    "text": "After taking a look at reviews on Yelp, a friend and I decided to chance it and head over to Zookz.  We found an empty restaurant at 11:45am on a Monday, which piqued our curiosity.  The inside was adorned with a few flat screens, a gourmet beverage station, and the clerks even took our orders on iPads.    The staff was attentive and helpful, explaining that their sandwiches required a custom-ordered machine - sounded enticing.  We ordered and received our food promptly.  They were tasty, but the sandwiches are literally the size (and shape) of a baseball.  They are kind enough to serve their sammies with a side of salad (potato or kale salad), that is around 1oz. That's right - a baseball sized sandwich with a 1oz. salad - for approximately $8, not including a drink.  The sandwiches were solid, albeit a bit different than your usual fare.  But we left unsatisfied, and headed over to AJ's to grab an additional bite.  Check it out if you must, but you'll leave hungry.",

I didn't expect it to be that good, simpliy because I didn't know exactly what is was. it's basically a super thin but mega crisp pita like pressed sandwich packed to the gills with great ingredients.  I went with the number 20: Turkey with avocado, bacon, cheddar, tomato and honey mustard. What can I say but VERY good! They had quite a few other \"sandwiches\" there that looked good as well. My sandwich came with this little corn, black bean salad that was dressed perfectly. I also got to sample this oatmeal cake, that was super good. All in all, great little place to pick up a unique sandwich for under $7. My only drawback would be the limited hours they're open, but I get it for the area. Luckily I was home sick today so I was able to get there for lunch.",

Either way, all the sandwiches here are pressed and grilled in a circular fashion.  Not many options for a herbivore either, I think one sandwich, and maybe a sweet nutella version.  Again, totally underwhelming experience.  Won't be coming back....well, ever.  Make the trip a few blocks south to Pane Bianco, you won't regret it.",

Then, there are places with food that comes out so-so, but the service is so amazing you choose to support them in spite.  This place is the best of both those worlds.  I needed some breakfast, and the wonderful yelp community pointed me to here.  That's where the story gets better.  After being greeted by the owner when I walked in the door, conversing with her gorgeous self for a few minutes, and staring at all the amazing sandwiches, she finally convinced me to try the zinger.  I thought it was amazing!!  A sandwich that easily fits the Aristotle creed \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". This sandwich had poached eggs, which I thoroughly enjoy, some ham and various vegetables. Then, they put that between some delightful bread and make it into more or less my favorite sandwich in the whole wide world. GRILLED CHEESE!!  I think when you grill a sandwich, it can only be as good as the bread allows it to be, and they don't lack in this.  I heard her say the bread was fresh baked for them, and I should find out from where cuz I would buy bread from that place any day.    So, to be short, this place is amazing, I want to try every thing on the menu, but I don't get to visit Phoenix often.  I will be visiting this place whenever I have a chance though!!",

The egg ratio was way too much and I was hoping to see more crispy bacon. Breakfast prices are reasonable but if lunch portions are the same, then I'd be a bit more hesitant.",

I was greeted by a smiling man behind the counter who was friendly and gave me some helpful suggestions on what sandwiches were popular. I opted for the #10, even though that wasn't on his suggestions. It came with turkey, apples, parmesan cheese and hot mustard and I opted for the side of their kale salad over a few different kinds of potato chips.   After a short wait, my to-go order was brought out. As I took my Zookz sandwich out of the bag once home I realized it was a warm panini like sandwich that reminded me of those crustables PBnJ sandwiches you see in the freezer aisle. To my delight, the sandwich was really good. The apples gave the turkey a nice crisp sweetness and the flavor mixture was good. I really enjoyed the kale salad as well and dressing that came on it was nice and light and perfect for the salad. I would consider it a light lunch but it did fill me up for several hours.  I can't wait to go back and try all the other options! I checked their website for nutrition information but didn't see any. Anyone know if they have it? If not, I hope they do soon!",

The owner greeted us and made us feel welcome.  I had seen some of their unique sandwiches on this site and had one thing on my mind....good poached eggs.  I was not disappointed.  I had the No. 11 breakfast sandwich and I can say without a doubt that it was the best thing I have eaten out in recent memory.  My wife had the No. 25 and she loved it as well.  Our pet Dolly got a nice bowl of cool water and a dog biscuit (she was much more interested in what we were having, though)  When I ordered, the owner informed me that they cook their eggs through and if I wanted them any different, just to ask.  I custom ordered it with my eggs just before fully cooked.  I got my sandwich and they were done to perfection, not to mention the sandwich itself was perfection.  Crispy on the edges, good \"tooth\", in the middle and the inside was pure deliciousness.  Their unique method off cooking a sandwich makes any of their sandwiches simply delicious.    Hey, and don't forget one of their hand prepared sides.  Like potato salad?  You'll love their version.  Like kale? Their kale salad is like no other.  If you think you don't like kale or have never tried kale.......try it!  You'll be glad you did.  I'll definitely be going back to try all their other sandwiches and try to pick a favorite.",

The breakfast sandwiches are beyond good.  In fact, we have been there six times over the past two weeks! The restaurant is exceptionally clean and the staff is very friendly. They even remembered our names after the first visit.  The breakfast sandwich is plenty enough for a satisfying meal.  Our favorites are the #22 and the #55 (Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almonds).  Try it once and you will go back. Little wonder it was named \"Best Sandwich Spot\" in the valley by a local magazine.",

She also mentioned that if I didn't like it that she would make me another sandwich no problem. The sauce on the sandwich with was a cream cheese siracha sauce and it was so yummy! But the real show stopper for me was the side kale salad. It was sweet and savory. I've never had a better tasting salad in my life. I can't wait to go back with my fiance! You have to go!",

I ordered the 45, which had spinach, basil, tomatoes, mozzarella, red peppers and probably something else I forgot.  I also had to try the kale salad.    My first bite was delicious!  Yummy bread, good flavors... A real winner.  Then I took a second bite and realized the inside was still ice cold.  :-(. The big chunk of spinach was super cold and the cheese wasn't melted.  It was sooo disappointing but I still ate it because I was hungry and it didn't taste bad cold.  The kale salad was out of this world!  Sooo yummy!  I will definitely be back to try it again and hopefully it will be fully cooked.  Even with the sandwich being cold inside, I still liked it enough that it warrants 4 stars.  The fact the ingredients were fresh and it wasn't frozen spinach helped with the good rating too.  I will try it again soon and update my review to what I'm hoping will be 5 stars!    Seriously... the kale salad is yummy... go try it now!",

I searched around and saw that Zooks was pretty highly rated and affordable, so we decided to try it out.  I'm glad we picked Zooks for our last meal in Arizona, because it was awesome. The location is small, but incredibly clean and bright. The menu is easy to understand, and every employee was incredibly pleasant and helpful. I got the number 35, which was excellent, and my mom got the...Turkey club one. Not sure about the number., but she liked it. We also tried the potato salad, which while different than the egg or mustard potato salad I'm used to, was good. Creamy with a bit of spice, but not overseasoned. My mom got the garbanzo beans, which she loved, and then an employee who may or may not have been the manager also gave us a kale salad to try for free, which was, like everything else, fantastic.  This ran us about $20 with fountain drinks, which isn't bad for lunch. If I'm ever in town again, I will definitely be coming back to Zooks (or maybe they could open a location in Dallas? :D)",

I ordered the No. 5 Salad which is fresh Mixed Greens, chicken, crumbled bacon, roasted almonds, cranberries, diced apples, shredded carrots, and Zookz Creamy Apple Mustard Dressing. It was everything that a salad should be! Light, refreshing, yet extremely satisfying. I ordered the dressing on the side to be a little healthier, but it was so good that I ended up eating it all anyways.  A week or so later, I decided to try breakfast. I went with the online ordering again and got a Nutella, peanut butter and banana sandwich for my boyfriend and an egg sandwich for myself. The sandwiches look a  little on the small side, but are surprisingly filling. They are also more like an uncrustable than a regular sandwich, but that's part of the charm.  The Nutella sandwich was pretty good, and not overly sweet considering its contents. I liked my egg sandwich that included bacon, ham, cheddar, black beans, avocado, and zookz chipotle sauce. My only dislike was I wish they let you do a little more customizing when ordering online.  I hope they consider some later hours in the future. They only open through lunch right now, and it would definitely be convenient to order online and pick up dinner on the way home... if I still lived in Phoenix.",

Both people working the day I came in were incredibly kind and patient, offering solid menu suggestions, but without rushing anyone.  I really hope to return soon.    ENJOY!",

I really enjoyed the sandwich except the fact that they can't control the cook on the eggs resulting in overcooked egg yolks. Who wants that?

Is it a pie? Is it an empanada? I have no idea which exact family Zookz sandwiches fall under, but just know that there is a delicious filling tucked into a circular blanket of dough. I've ordered the popular No. 11 a few times now, which has cream cheese, egg, and bacon in the filling. Biting into it, the cream cheese gushes out in ample glory and egg yolk drips in suit with each bite. I adore breakfast food and can't help but be a fan.",

Ohhhh, this was so good! My husband and I went halvsies so we can try both sandwiches and I wanted to steal his half! lol. The sandwich is, indeed, unique. It's kind of like a pan fried crispy-soft pita bread. This was my favorite out of the two. 5/5  - #20: Thinly sliced turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and sweet mustard sauce. This was good as well. It was a little messier to eat because it was stuffed with fillings. It, too, had good flavor. 4.5/5  Service: The cashier was really friendly and talkative. I did mention that I found Zookz through Yelp but the waitress failed to mention that if I checked in I would get 10% off. I have a habit of checking in while I'm waiting for my food, in other words, too late. It would have been nice if she said something. The owner stopped by to ask us how we liked our sandwiches. She was really nice and approachable. 5/5  Final thoughts: My husband doesn't ever compliment food. Everything is okay to him. But he loved Zookz! He said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. If he likes it, it's gotta be good! I can't wait to come back here when I'm in Arizona!",

(we loved it so much that we went again after our Monday morning workout). The customer service here is second to none and the menu is perfect (not too little, not too much).  Saturday the cashier suggested we try the potato salad along with the jalapeno chips (key here is to use the chips as the spoon..holy toledo Batman!). As a first timer she asked if we like Kale salad and offered it up for free (another excellent selection). The dressing is made of mandarin oranges and it is good.  I had a #33 (feta, parmesan, tomatoes, spinach, fresh basil and 2 poached eggs [they were more on the soft boiled side in my opinion but, good nonetheless]) and added bacon. My entire face was in my plate but, Mr. B. had a #66 (cheddar, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions and zookz ginger cream cheese sauce). That sauce that was absolutely divine.   Monday we tried #'s 45 & 60 with a few modifications that didn't disappoint. This is definitely a place to stop by if you're in the area or drive the distance if you're not.

The turkey sandwich ordered had a fishy taste :( and the corners of the bread were very hard and inedible. Almost all of it went in the garbage.  Pictures looked so good on the menu. Was very disappointed and then angry the owner called to tell us we can't tell the difference between mozzarella and chicken. I am sure most anyone can tell the difference from cheese and chicken. just...no. Stay away.",

    "text": "Zookz is serving up some really yummy sandwiches!  Their sandwich is definitely unique. The way the bread is toasted/pressed together makes it even more enjoyable.  I'm pretty sure the press used to make the sandwiches is proprietary so this was the first time I've had a sandwich pressed in this style.  I went with the #20 ($8.25): Turkey, bacon, avocado and tomatoes, with shredded cheddar cheese, and honey mustard.  It was really tasty, perfect amount of everything so each bite was delicious.  It had the perfect amount of honey mustard, I ate it all up and was hungry for more. It is a modest portion, but was so enjoyable.  The wife went with the #45 ($7.25): fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach, roasted red peppers, fresh basil and honey balsamic vinaigrette.  She absolutely loved it. Very good vegetarian sandwich.  Again, just the perfect amount of ingredients including the very tasty honey balsamic vinaigrette.  The potato salad was pretty good and had a southwest take, including black beans and corn.  I'd be back for the sandwiches. Very tasty and a great to go option when on the run.",

The owner Carol was extremely outgoing, friendly, and cordial!    These sandwiches could be described as fancy \"hot pockets\" on a phyllo-style dough... BUT I don't think that description actually does these sandwiches justice.  I'll just default to Zookz' description as \"sandwiches with an edge\"...  a very good edge!  And lunch and breakfast sandwiches are served all day long.    The #25 is a glorious combination of ham, turkey, black beans, melted cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and some sort of sauce that I can't recall because I scarfed down the sandwich so quickly!  Sooooo good!  Yay!",

I gotta say , they have some very sensational flavors in their food, I love the aesthetic of the place and they seem to use very fresh ingredients. Their mocha iced coffee was probably one of the best iced coffees I've ever had!!",

It's very modern looking and in a really cool complex of other restaurants. There are lots of delicious options to choose from for breakfast or lunch. I decided on the #20 and was so pleased. I also got the garbanzo bean salad- much like a potato salad- as my side dish. The \"sandwich\" is not like anything I've ever had before. Kind of a cross between and \"uncrustable\" and a panini and so, so good! The whole story behind the restaurant and contraption used to make the sandwich is on a little card at each table and I kind of love that it's a little family tradition that developed into such a great place to eat. A major plus is that it is super affordable! $14 for a full meal and mimosa! I feel like you get a lot for what you pay and I love a good deal. Will definitely pay them another visit when we are in the area.",

They have a good variety of breakfast and lunch sandwiches, which all come presses into this tasty bread. You order at the counter, receive a number, and on my visit they delivered the order to the table.   I went with the #11 breakfast sandwich, which came with eggs, bacon, cheese, tomato, basil and cream cheese. It was sooooo good! The basil really added to it for me. It was easy to eat, not too filling, and tasty. Not to mention the price point: it was only $6.25.   They have coffee beverages as well as a few iced tea selections. They also ave gluten free bread for those with allergies. They also had recycle and trash separated, so you gotta love that.   The interior is super cute and trendy. It was clean and had a nice vibe. I'd definitely return to check out some of their other items!",

She also came and checked on us after we got the food. She is definitely on top of everything and seems to care that you're taken care of.   The kale salad was really good. Kale can be hit or miss in almost everything but theirs is tasty and not bitter. I ate two of their sandwiches and both were good though the edges make it a little tougher than I think you'd expect. You end up chewing a bit on the pressed part. Overall it's good and worth checking out if you want something different than the normal sandwich fare.",

What makes this so good is the expert handling of the kale.  It is sufficiently bruised and deveined which renders the kale tender enough to eat without the addition of other greens.  I have had kale salads other places and usually most it is inedible due to the chewy ribs left on the kale.   I paid extra to add skinless, boneless, skinless chicken to this supurb dish! It  tasted blandbut worked well with the tangy dressing.  The owner Carol is welcoming and provides a clean, attractive dining area.  All the recipes are creations of Carol\"s extensive wealth of experience as a chef.  Love this little gem!",

    "text": "I would NEVER pass up an opportunity to stop by Zookz when I'm in the area. Heck, I'd even drive a few miles extra to be able to stop by and grab a sandwich pillow full of delicious goodness, made with fresh ingredients, toasted and sealed to perfection. Quite honestly, Zookz has the BEST sandwiches I've ever had -- they're a cross between an adult gourmet version of hot pockets and paninis... and if THAT'S not a great combo, I don't know what is!   Not only do I make it a point to stop by Zookz when I'm in the area, I bring someone with me every time. One bite of the deliciousness served up by Zookz and you get hooked, I'm telling you. I brought my mom with me and at first she was a bit skeptical, but it was love at first bite. She ordered the No. 35 (Thinly sliced roast beef, crisp bacon, fresh tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and Zookz Horseradish Sauce), which came with a side kale salad. I ordered the No. 66 (Cheddar cheese, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions, and Zookz zinger cream cheese sauce). It was all extremely flavorful and delicious, so much so that it's almost a sad and disappointing moment when you finish your last bite and realize you don't have more left. On the plus side though, you can always order more (if you're still hungry), or come back for more another time. Yaaasssss!!!  Moral of the story: Don't judge a sandwich just 'cause it looks small and cute; not only will Zookz satisfy your tastebuds, but it will also satisfy your hunger.",

The menu is small but varied, the price is awesome ($4.50-$4.75), and the product is delicious. I got a vegetarian breakfast sandwich (#33: two poached eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach) and my boyfriend got the Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almond sandwich. We both happily demolished them immeditately. Both Carol, the owner, and the young guy working the register were pleasant and conversational. Carol seemed to make fast friends with every customer who walked in, making sure to check on them and ask their names. One unusual thing about Zookz is the addition of a small sink at the beverage counter. This is so useful for dumping out leftover ice and liquids and rinsing plastic containers before you place them in the recycle bin next to it.   Oh, and they have punch cards! 10th sandwich is free! We will definitely be trying this place again.",

Even on a busy day, and busy lunch rush the wait is never very long and the manager always makes sure to ask if everything is enjoyable.

The ladies working behind the counter were super nice, helpful, and very welcoming. We met the owner who was the sweetest lady and I even suggested an idea for a sandwich. The ambiance of the place is relaxing and open, not stuffy at all or has that heavy food smell. The meal deal is a great price because it includes a side that is a decent portion with the main dish you order. I had the popular #20 with the kale salad as my side and the pomegranate green tea.....YASSSSS AMAZING! The style of the sandwich is so unique and it's just enough to fill you up! The bread is similar to a sourdough in the way that it is soft in the middle but has a great crunch on the outside but it doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like some breads do when they are toasted. Everything was fresh that was in the sandwich and in the salad. I will definitely be back and this place is PHENOMENAL!",

Crust on both sides thin not thick. Owner Carol recently relocated to Uptown Plaza from original location just south of Camelback on Central where there was limited parking and trolley track problems. Plenty of parking at Uptown Plaza. Seating for 50 inside, another 30 outside-covered-windows open for more ambiance with misters when needed.  outside is covered. The one weakness in our opinion is the coffee, it is bitter.

They have a custom panini press, special-made bread, fresh ingredients and attention to detail. You won't find a traditional sandwich on their menu. The owner used to bottle salad dressings for AJs, and their kale + tangerine salad is heaven. Some restaurants have fantastic food, some restaurants have fantastic service, some restaurants have fantastic atmosphere, but finding a place that excels at all three -- and is affordable -- is rare. Love supporting local businesses where the people are just as exceptional as the food they make.  Great place for families, lunch dates, solo bites and indoor/outdoor eating in the cooler months.",

I was early picking up my order but they had it ready for me.  Was greeted by both the owner (I think she's the owner) and the cashier - great customer service.  My expectations for a healthy salad at lunch were not very high, but this was absolutely delicious, had chx breast, black beans, sunflower seeds, corn, and this awesome honey balsamic vinaigrette.  Even though it was simple ingredients, the fact that they were fresh and high-quality made all the difference.  Normally I don't get salads this good without paying over $10 OR making them myself.  Highly recommend this place for a delicious lunch and it's super affordable.  The sandwiches look amazing....brie and ham for less than $7??!",

They put potatoes in this sandwich which ruined the taste of the other ingredients.  When potatoes or rice are added to something like this, I perceive it as \"filler\" food...food that is cheaper and fills up the entre.  It would have been ALOT better without them.  A pricey little sandwich.  Probably won't visit it again but it might work for others.",

We ordered two of the turkey bacon avocado sandwiches and one of the roast beef.  This is going to be our new fave place.  The food hit the spot and tasted amazing.  The potato salad is to die for and they even have a few different flavors of fresh brewed tea to choose from. Our favorite tea was the peach flavor.

I was looking for a light lunch to have with my family, and found this near my location with high reviews. I checked it out and good god I was impressed. The owner had AMAZING customer service, she went over the menu, and all the best sellers with us, and even suggested what the kids would like and how they would like it. At first, I thought to myself \"I might have to get two sandwiches because they seem small and I'm really hungry\". Well, I'll admit I was wrong. I ordered a lunch sandwich that comes with a side salad (potato salad with black beans). It was all great.       I had to have a bite of everyone's sandwiches at the table, and every single one was great. I had a #10, with turkey, Parmesan, apples, walnuts, cranberries and their sweet heat sauce, and I might have to make that my usual. But I want to try the rest of their menu as well. DEFINITELY a lunch spot I'll be returning to over and over any time I'm in the area!",

Located off Camelback Road but can be a little difficult to miss unless you're in the actual compound, then the sign becomes visible. Lots of parking.  The place is on the small side (-1).  There is outside seating, tough in my opinion, not enough.  High chairs and tables are available indoors, but still I couldn't help but feeling quite choked whilst in there. Staff were great and friendly.  Answered any questions we had and even made recommendations.  Menu was easy to comprehend.  Restaurant has an open concept so I'm not sure how customers would be cooled during the hot summer months.  Restaurant was clean.  Food was delicious.  The rounded toasted sandwich concept is interesting and innovative.  Everything is made fresh.  I had the pulled pork (I believe #60) and that comes with a side. I chose their potato salad.  The latter was fresh, tasty, and a small kick to it.  The sandwich tasted fresh and flavorful. If I'm in the area again, I'd definitely like to try some of the other choices on the menu, but will probably take it away or eat in my car.",

To be honest i wasnt expecting a lot of bacon, because lets be real here, what place actually puts a lot of bacon in anything? To my surprise it was filled with chopped bacon. 4/5! Also to add the ladies at the front were extremely nice!  And of course the REAL reason i came here was because of the #55. Nutella, banana, peanut butter and roasted almond goodness! Ugh. Im a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter. Oh my gosh this sounded like heaven and it was!!! 5/5 This is the only reason for my 5 star review. I didnt know such thing even exsisted on earth. This will def be bad for my wallet and ill pay for it at the gym.. damn",

I want to come back to try the breakfast sandwiches.   I ended up choosing the No 26 and it was soooo good. The ham was heated well, the potato and the cheese tasted so good together. I don't know what to say. It was such a good little place to eat lunch.",

I have been to the uptown location a couple of times with coworkers - it's very unique and trendy. The sandwiches are amazingly delicious and shaped like a spaceship, IMO. I adore that they have gluten free bread and that's why they're hands down my favorite sandwich shop in Phoenix. Sandwiches come with a side - your choice of a kale/mandarin salad, which is delicious, a rather unusual but tasty potato salad that has black beans in it, or a bag of Tim's chips. I have tried all their lunch sandwiches with the exception of the 2 vegetarian choices, and all are really good. My guilty pleasure here is #35 with roast beef, bacon, tomatoes, potatoes and horseradish sauce - wowza! I have not yet tried their breakfast sandwiches but a coworker has tried most of them and gives them two thumbs up so I will have to try one soon.",

Fresh brewed iced tea and clean and fun atmosphere.   If you are super hungry you will need two sandwiches. If you dislike white bread you will not like this tasted road white bread sandwich.",

    "text": "Saw it the day before on 3TV. If Scott Pasmore eats something with vegetables on it you better go try it. 3TV claimed this was the best breakfast sandwich in Phoenix. I still have more to try but this is on top of my list currently! Went with the number 44: two egg frittata, bacon, ham ,feta cheese, parmesan, roasted red peppers & fresh basil.  This was stupid delicious. I could tell from what I saw on TV the crust was going to be the best part but it is so much better than your eyes let you see. I have so many things I want stuffed in it. Every bite, crust, eggy goodness and bacon explosions.   Split the number 20: Thinly sliced turkey, bacon, fresh avocado,tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese zookz sweet heat mustard sauce.   This was out of this world! even with the sauce. But don't get me wrong I like the sauce. I just wasn't expecting it cuz I didn't know it was on it. My friend ordered this. I knew what to expect with mine but not with this. The sauce is sweet and it works but I feel like it could have worked without it. Me personally I'd swap it out with the chipotle sauce and be okay. But it was bananas how good it was.   I got the Mimosa sandwich combo amazing deal. $10. The passion fruit Mimosa was so damn good. I don't even drink often but I chugged this down like I was going day drinking. I wasn't.   Now we didn't get our side salad and both agreed we were still a little hungry. I think if we'd gotten the side salad with the second sandwich we wouldn't have been. What I would love is if they had something with the breakfast items like the side salad with the lunch. We weren't sure if it was cause we got drinks instead of, or of it was forgotten but it was all good.   I would pay good money for cheesy hashbrowns. shredded potatoes stuffed with cheese toasted in that amazing toaster. Steal my idea.   Overall amazing value great food will be back want to know how much they'll let you customize. Sorry bout the teeth marks in the pics I had to eat it right away.",

So glad they were open until 4 pm, since their Cityscape location isn't open on Saturdays. Found a parking spot right in front and walked in. Love that it opens up to outdoor seating, with a couple of tables inside as well.   I decided to order the #10, which is turkey, Parmesan cheese, almonds, cranberries, apples, and sweet heat mustard sauce. It came with a side salad and I got their potato salad, which includes corn, green onions, and black beans. My gosh that was surprisingly delicious. The sandwich was fun, it's packed with flavor and as someone else has called it, it's basically an adult uncrustable. I'm a fan of crust but this totally works. I'd like to try their breakfast sandwiches one day and their peanut butter dessert option.   Service was quick and friendly, and be sure to check in for 10% off.",

This place is those weird uncrustable sandwiches meets a toasty, cheesy, delicious stuffed sandwich that you actually WANT to eat. The one I ordered had turkey, bacon, tomato, cheese, a honey mustard sauce and avocado. The flavors all melded really well together. I will say if you are super hungry, this sandwich may not cut it for you as they are on the smaller side. However I think this place is perfect for when you want a small bite and want to make sure that small bite has big flavor. Per usual, parking situation is important to me. This location is located in the uptown plaza which has plenty of parking that is free.",

Zookz is casual, order/pay ahead, get your meal promptly brought out to you while you do the fixings on your coffee (they also have mimosas for those looking to help a hangover), no stress weekend breakfast. Perfect if it's a particular day in which you need to get things done and can't afford to spend 1-3 hours boozing over eggs and pancakes. Good service, friendly, menu is creative to satisfy most.

    "text": "FOOD: the sandwich was pretty yummy. It is pretty small though and not as filling as expected. My friend and I were both still hungry after we were done with our sandwiches. But they both had great flavor and are different from most sandwiches out there.   SERVICE: minimal interaction due to the fact that you go up and order and they bring the food out to you. If you get a side salad you have to pick it from the fridge which is a little odd.   Atmosphere: it is veryyyyyy tiny in here. Definitely a place to grab a quick sandwich. Doesn't seem ideal for a long lunch or breakfast date. The bathroom doesn't have a changing table which is supppper frustrating. I had to go change my baby in my car. Places should always have a changing table.",

The customer service was great very friendly & welcoming staff. The sandwich was delicious I got the No 25 and the contents inside were filled as much as they could have been (Also, huuuuge fan of the sweet chipotle sauce). It's like a glorified grilled cheese with happiness inside! Also the side was a good addition I got the garbanzo bean one & the lemon zest gave it a good flavor.",

    "text": "I've seen the ads. I've read the reviews. And the fact is, people are selling Zookz - and selling it hard! Maybe too hard, in fact.    Not that I think Zookz is bad. I like them for an occasional lunch option. But when I read some of these reviews, one would think that I'm eating some revolutionary sandwich that is going to grant me immortality and make me immune from ever being summoned for jury duty.   If you're the type that enjoys your sandwiches jam-packed with a hodgepodge of ingredients, then fully expect great things. Throw on a little hot sauce if you feel your choice is lacking in flavor. But honestly, I really see these sandwiches as just a boatload of stuff all jam packed into toasted bread. Nothing inside the sandwiches particularly pops out as memorable - meaning that they all taste very similar.  The bread has always kind of baffled me. The edges are hard and chewy, while the majority of it is nice and crispy. I'd call it a cross between an empanada and a pot pie. But for some reason, I keep wanting more flavor from it, almost like the crust from a pasty or a torta bun. But it's just not there.   For six to eight dollars, I guess it works for what it is. But let's face it, a five-star Pane Bianco sandwich this most definitely is not. But based on all their five star reviews, what the hell do I know?  If you're seeking something quick, cheap, and edible, then Zookz is definitely worth trying. And when I look at their setup and approach, Zookz is the kind of place that I can easily see becoming a chain in the not so distant future.  Check them out.",

After our meal, she surprised us with some sort of Nutella marries peanut butter concoction.  What!  Delicious.  The owner Carol also stopped by and shared some of the story of how she started, super sweet woman.  This business will turn into a franchise down the road, just wait.

First of all, the employees are all so helpful, kind and accommodating; and they were eager to please. These sandwiches are absolutely delicious. They are all pretty unique in one way or another, but my husband and I split two different sandwiches and were equally thrilled with both. Their crust is enough by itself to make any sandwich taste good.  For those of you with a picky palate, they are willing to make a sandwich however you please, so don't fret when you don't see anything on the menu that sounds good. Also tried the kale salad and potato salad. Both were absolutely delicious and unique!  All in all, my tummy was extremely happy when we left and I will definitely be back.",

The fillings are sliced delicately thin and diced just right. The fillings are tenderly nestled between two circular pieces of bread, and the whole thing is cooked so that the bread is toasty brown and the fillings are warm and juicy. The whole thing adds up to a party in your mouth. It's almost like a gourmet grilled cheese, but way more amaze-balls.  I had the #20, turkey, bacon, avocado with some amazing magical sauce in it. You get a small salad with any sandwich. I had the kale, nut, mandarin orange salad. As if the sandwich wasn't amazing enough, the salad put me over the edge.  On my second visit, I had the roast beef cheddar bacon (#35). Yum yum yum yum yum.  The service is great and the place is very cute.  I highly recommend Zookz for lunch.",

    "text": "I've been here twice now, and while not bad, I find nothing really satisfying about the place. First visit, my breakfast sandwich fillings were distributed mostly to one side, so one half was relatively tasty but the other side was bland. 2nd visit, my lunch sandwich fillings were good, but nothing really stood out that would make want the sandwich again, or even to return to Zookz at all. My biggest complaint about Zookz is the bread. Their 'uncrustable' style of sandwich pocket pressing results in a very dry, very hard, unappealing, nearly inedible 1\" surround on the sealed edge of the bread. If they buttered the bread before closing it up in their clamshell press, it might improve the product.   Zookz isn't bad; it just fell far short of my expectations based on reviews. Two visits & I'll opt for the many other better sandwich places around town from now on.",

I came in at noon on a Tuesday and ordered the mozz/spinach sandwich with a side of kale salad and a drink. While I waited for my sandwich, I stood by the fountain drinks waiting for the repair man to get down from his ladder blocking the faucets...he didn't. I stood there for 10 mins waiting for him to move until I finally asked the cashier if I would be able to get a drink. Ok, forgiven. The extremely hard crust on what is deemed to be a crustless sandwich was inexcusable. The contents of the sandwich were good, but only after peeling off the edges was I able to enjoy it. The kale salad was sub-par. Maybe I came on an off day, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Overall, worth a shot but don't build it up before you go. It's nothing to write home about.",

Not a good idea when your boyfriend refuses to go because he needs at least 3 sandwiches to feel satisfied. If you do the math, that's about $18-20, with no drink.

Zookz takes a delicious new look at the classic panini, and I couldn't be happier to report that they're friggin' tasty!   I had a No 25 filled with ham, fresh tomatoes and avocados, seasoned black beans, shredded cheddar cheese, and housemade chipotle sauce. Already the sammich sounded delicious, but I was given the advice, which I kindly accepted, to add bacon. Everything is apparently better with bacon, and this sandwich was no exception to that rule. With my sandwich I had a side of Zookz's potato salad that was also tasty, and definitely fresh!  Friendly staff mixed with delicious and inventive cooking make Zookz a hit in my book, especially for lunch. The only negative I could possibly have is the serving size. If you're a hungry person, they're sandwiches may need to settle a bit before they'll fill you up. That said, don't let that stop you from dropping in! I personally can't wait to go for breakfast!",

When the owner came by to see how we liked our sandwiches, I mentioned this. She promptly made me another without the mustard and at no additional charge. That's the way service should be! Thin, crispy bread is exactly what I want in a sandwich and they do it perfectly. We will definately be back. And this will be my new take out spot for workday lunch.",

These guys work pretty quickly too in order to get you your food in a timely manner. The menu itself is pretty extensive too.

The food just isn't anything special. Decent but not great.  I have to believe the Yelp ratings are based on service and price rather than flavor. All these things are important but food should be king. My wife ordered a #10 (by mistake she really wanted to try the #15; our fault ) and I had a #20. For the ingredients in my sandwich it should have had a lot more flavor. Turkey is shredded so more like a turkey salad. I saw the avocado and the bacon but no discernible flavors from them. Off day? Not fresh? The toasted bread itself was just really dry and the crust extra hard. My wife's was dry too and felt the apples were to overpowering. Maybe too many? Any way there are a lot of great places to eat in this area so I see no compelling reason to come back. Feel like Yelp failed me this time.",

I love sandwiches, but get tired of chips...Zooks has four side salads to choose from, each looked better than the next, which comes with your sandwich instead of chips.

If you come to this place to eat be sure to try a #20 with one of their fresh brewed teas to drink. Don't forget to grab either chips or a side salad that comes with every lunch sandwich. And if you're feeling like treating yourself, make sure to order a #55 for dessert! Can't wait to eat here again.",

My dad was in love with the sandwiches and even last weekend he brought up how good the breakfast sandwich was at \"that one place that starts with a Z\". I got the No. 33; poached eggs, feta and parmesan cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, and fresh basil mmmmm Can't go wrong with some fresh basil. My dad got the No. 44 and apparently it was to die for, obviously since he's still talking about it. We met the owner who was super nice and down to earth. Explained that they were in a different neighborhood and recently moved to this new location. It's in the \"new and up and coming\" neighborhood of the uptown plaza; Located next to Chipotle and Flower Child off of Camelback.   The atmosphere is small, quiet. I love that all the windows open so it's like you're sitting outside. I think they even have mimosas now which is new. I've never had their lunch sandwiches, but i'll definitely give them a try.",

After two attempts at different deli establishments (both closed on Sundays), we stumbled upon Zookz.   I had #15 (the turkey, cranberries, roasted almonds, and a light curry sauce) with a side of Kale salad.  It was light, tasty, filling, and satisfying!  The combination of these wonderful, fresh ingredients made my mouth as happy has can be.  Of course, the best part was the toasted bread-you've got to experience it!  You'll see nothing like this anywhere.  My boyfriend had a breakfast sandwich (don't recall which one it actually was), but he said it was delicious too!    If you crave something fresh, healthy, and original (the toasted bread-like Panini pocket), you have to try this place, it's totally worth it!",

They take two slices of bread sort of a french bread, put the ingredient in the middle and press it in some sort of machine to melt and seal it all together. Very tasty.  I had a breakfast sandwich with poached eggs and my partner had a turkey sandwich that came with a side salad. Both sandwiches were fantastic with all the ingredients fused together  and the side kale salad with orange dressing was amazing. Please make this into a regular size salad with chicken or something, its delicious.",

    "text": "When I was a child. Yes 50+ years ago we had a device to make grilled cheese sandwiches in the design as this establishment so I experienced a time warp when I got my sandwich These folks have innovated the sandwich. I've only been for breakfast but by far the extra attention they use must be experienced. Whether it is adding cream cheese or basil to a breakfast sandwich which makes you pay attention. Hey if you want ordinary go get an egg Mcmuffin. Excellent. Excellent excellent. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I'm a morning eater and to me coffee is king. I would step up the coffee service so people stay and eat there. That's all. These sandwiches are taaaaaasty!!!!!!! Good job. Please it's been a while since I moved to Chandler so you may have improved the coffee service. If not take this as kindly input. And you don't have to go the barista route ($) just get a premium brew and containers to hold them hot without further heating like a hot plate which sours the coffee in 15 minutes. I want you to thrive because I looooove these sandwiches.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I passed this place driving by and thought the storefront looked fun so we thought we'd give it a try.   Zookz is kind of an order-up sandwich place. Order at the counter, sit down and they serve you. Nice and casual.   One thing I really liked about this place is that the person at the counter was very helpful and was ready with suggestions for those of us newbies. The sandwiches here are interesting in that they are sealed/seared into circles so all the goodies are on the inside not leaking out the back end. The other great thing is that they are really open to substitutions and customization so that you can have the exact sandwich you want. I don't even think they charged me for adding an ingredient. We each got the #20, which is the bacon turkey avocado. He got his per the menu and I swapped the mustard for the chipotle sauce and added roasted red peppers.   On first impression I will be honest I thought I would still be hungry when I was finished, but watch out the size is deceiving! Halfway through I had started to get full, so portion size was actually perfect.  Oh, and try the kale salad. I was skeptical about this as well because I don't normally like kale but this was really good. Julienned with mandarin oranges and almonds. Really tasty.   All in all, a very yummy lunch for about $17 for two. I'd love to go back next time I'm close to downtown.",

    "text": "So I've been a roll on trying new great lunch spots and Zookz is just that. I was craving a salad (even though their known for their sandwiches) and I saw one on their menu that made my stomach jump up and down with excitement.   I got the #3 salad that has mixed greens, black beans, corn, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, chicken, and a honey balsamic dressing. And yes, it was as delicious as it sounds! My stomach and I were completely satisfied. I ordered to go and they made sure to put two dressing in there with the salad which made me happy. Nothing worse than an underdressed salad!! Situation averted.   As I was standing in line I was able to briefly skim the rest of their menu and see some pictures of their popular breakfast and lunch sandwiches. They looked amazing and I was surprised to find out that they are unique sandwiches as they're pressed/made/heated into a pocket like form so all the goodies of the sandwich are invisible to the naked eye until bit into (or cut in half). Basically, they look yummy and fascinating. I can't wait to go back and try one out. They also have dessert sandwiches too!  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I wish I lived a little closer so I could frequent this spot more often. ALSO, check in on Yelp and received 10% off your bill!! Can't beat that!",

    "text": "El Hubbo (aka the Hubs or Hubby) and I stopped in on our way from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Sedona AZ, as I had bookmarked this place as our lunch destination after reading the great reviews of it!  First and foremost, I don't know anything about the Phoenix area, but the location of this place looks a little sketchy and in fact, I took a business call outside, prior to going into Zookz (because I didn't want to be obnoxious and talk on the phone while trying to order), and some random dude that was walking by starts mocking me.  LOL.  Weird.  Anyway, enough of that nonsense!  Zookz is a small place and when we did go in, we were the only ones in there because it was like 2 p.m., so clearly after lunch time for most normal people (including me, but I'm not normal).  I ordered the No. 20, which has turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and Zookz mustard sauce, and a small kale salad.  I was so hungry that I ate the kale salad immediately and it was OMG scrumdeliumtious!!  I really wanted more of it but knew I had a sandwich coming.   When my sandwich arrived, it was cute & round!  It reminded me of the sandwiches I use to make at home way back when with my little Presto Sandwich Maker, and that's how it tasted, too!  It was really yummy!  I liked that it wasn't too filling, it was just right.  I kind of felt like I could eat 2 of them, but then I knew I would be in a carb coma on the way to Sedona.  The employees here are super friendly and I also liked that they have a Hot Dog Cart Showroom across the street.  Are hot dog carts big in Phoenix that they need a showroom?!  BAHAHAHA!  We would definitely return again if in the area!!",

Delightfully paired ingredients for breakfast or lunch. Quick, fresh, hot, delicious...what more could you ask for. Oh yes, breakfast around $4 -$5 and lunch around $6.50. Tasteful modern clean interior. Now open every day this will become a fast favorite. Try the Kale side salad (included in price) with chef/owner Carole's secret dressing. Wow!",

The Zook is served with a choice of side salad, unfortunately all their salads have nuts. I have nut allergies as do many people in this world, so be aware of the ingredient list when you order. I complained about the nuts, the owner said she would make me a new salad. I was not in a mood to wait after driving around for 5 mins. trying to park. So I took my order and went back to work. 15 mins later the owner showed up at my shop with a nut free salad! WOW, now that is customer service. I'm not even sure how she tracked me down, I was amazed. Thanks Zooks Lady. She even said she is going to rethink having nuts in so many menu items.",

I wanted a salad as well, and was about to buy one. The owner gave me a fresh serving of the kale salad for free. I have never tried kale before, and it is amazing!!!  The salad was delicious! It was so good I ordered another one to bring home. I also had one of their desserts. YUMMY! Everyone left happy and full. Definitely coming back for more.   Everyone there was so nice, I can't wait to go back. Maybe next weekend... :)",

And my friend was right about it all... Delicious ingredients- hot, flavorful, fresh, wholesome- in an easy-to-eat pocket sandwich with crispy sealed edge. The serving size was perfect- just the right amount without leaving me hungry or too full. And the price was great- I think I spent around $6 for the #44 (2 egg frittata w bacon, ham, feta, parmesan, roasted red peppers & basil) and a large green iced tea. And I also had to buy the #55 to-go, because how could I walk away without dessert for later... peanut butter, nutella, bananas, and  roasted almonds! A great big YUM! The staff was super friendly and helpful. Carole, the owner, made it a point to say hi and ask how I enjoyed my food. I loved the garage door front that allowed in the beautiful fall morning air and sunshine. And even the bright natural colors and fruit/veggie mural on the wall gave it a feel-good vibe. I will definitely be back to try even more of their sandwich creations... as well as their salads. I hear Carole's homemade dressings are amazing!",

We didn't know what we wanted to eat because of the different style sandwiches and the owner helped us. She was awesome. Even suggested what to add to my sandwich. While allowing my friend to sample the sauce she was unsure about.  A side comes along with the sandwich, and my friend picked chips and I picked the potato salad. The owner insisted we try the salad... and just gave it to us! So Impressed again!!  We decided to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the weather. The cashier came out to make sure we were okay as well as the owner. I will definitely come back here again for the great customer service and the amazing food.

    "text": "There's definitely a lot to like about Zookz and their unique twist on a sandwich shop.  The prices are great, the service is friendly, the atmosphere is chill, and online ordering is a snap.  I wouldn't call my first visit here a home run, but I can see why so many CenPho folks make this place their lunch staple.  I actually decided to venture here after leaving early from work on a Tuesday.  I had read the stellar reviews on Yelp (as well as a glowing recommendation from my sister) and figured I'd give it a go.  Their website makes a point of advertising the online ordering process so I figured I'd play it safe this time and order in advance in case of a big lunch rush.  The online ordering process is quite easy as you just pick your sandwich, choose a pickup time, pay, and done (I understand some folks may have reservations about paying for food in advance but I digress).  I came by around 11:30am to pick up my food.  As many have accurately pointed out, parking here is a chore.  In fairness I knew that in advance as I've patronized numerous restaurants and businesses in the area but parking has always been scarce.  Here's a tip, park a block north of Zookz on Pierson Street.  There's usually a decent amount of street parking and I believe the parking lot on the northwest corner of Pierson and Central can be used (though don't quote me on that).  I parked in that parking lot today and had no issues, so there you go.  Or if you take the light rail, the Central & Camelback station is just a couple of blocks away.    The restaurant itself is fairly small, but actually has a great deal more seating than I expected (including a decent amount of outdoor patio seating).  The orange and green color scheme is rather, eh, interesting, though they do keep the restaurant pretty clean.  Maybe I came at the right time, but there was barely anyone there when I got there at 11:30am.  Perhaps the lunch crowd hadn't yet flowed in.  In any event I came up to the counter, my food was ready, they let me pick a salad (I went with potato), and off I went.  The sandwiches here are unique in that they're made using an old school stove-top method.  They describe the process on their website, but essentially you get a sandwich that almost looks more like a stuffed pancake.  I got the #20 lunch sandwich (turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cheddar, and Zookz' own housemate sweet mustard).  Super tasty sandwich and for the most part the unique bread was a good compliment.  My only complaint was that the outer crust of my sandwich was pretty rock hard.  Not sure if thats normal, but it was a slightly unpleasant part of an otherwise pleasant experience.  The potato salad side I got was also pretty tasty.  Total price for the sandwich and side salad was $7.  I actually got a $1 off my order as they had a holiday online promo code I could use.  And I believe a Yelp check-in can get you 10% off if you're just a walkup customer.  Good price for a good amount of food.  I didn't feel uncomfortably full, but satisfied.  I'd certainly come back here again for lunch or to try one of their breakfast sandwiches.  I'm not sure they allow it, but it'd be nice to customize my own sandwich with my own choice of ingredients.  I'll investigate that possibility the next time.  Overall, a good choice, Yelpers.  A few kinks to work out before I give it the 5 star treatment, but Carole Meyer's creation shows a lot of promise.",

I think she enjoyed it!! I know my #33 was fabulous ... Every bite was heaven!   Great patio out front dog friendly with misters which keeps it nice & cool! Thank you for being so thoughtful   Will repeat. Mom said it wasn't as she imagined & the food had flavor which means we don't have to fight about my selection!",

Zookz was nearby and had good ratings so we checked it out.  What a different idea.  It reminds me of Uncrustables in the freezer section of the grocery store but with much more adult and better fillings.    I walked in and saw a picture of the #13 which is poached egg, feta, spinach, tomato.  I didn't even look any further..this looked amazing.  And it was!  I wish I could have tried more!  I do think my coworker could have eaten more but they did have some side options available.  The sandwich was less than $5, I believe.  All options appeared $7 and less.  They also have Coke products...I'm a sucker for a fountain diet Coke.  The service was really friendly with someone greeting us immediately, taking our order promptly, and even asking how our meal was and how we heard of Zookz!  My only desire is that they open one in Dallas or Plano, Texas!  (:",

Also, it was more of mashed potato salad.  Don't know if that is by design or if they tried to make the salad with the potatoes still hot. - Chickpea salad seemed to have a slight tuna fish flavor.  Maybe it was just me.  Good salad just an odd taste I couldn't fully identity. - 35 sandwich was good.  Horseradish sauce made the dish. - 45 sandwich was a disappointment.  Bland in taste and missing any of the honey balsamic vinaigrette that was supposed to be on it.",

First picture was the #26, it was filled with ham, bacon, tomatoes, avocado, potatoes, cheddar, and one of the House sauces. Second picture was the #60, it was filled with apple cider pulled pork, monterrey jack cheese, and their house slaw. Third picture was the #10, it was filled with Parmesan, turkey, apples, cranberries, roasted almonds, and their sweet heat mustard sauce. Last pictures just shows the sides your got with your sandwich and both were super good. One was the kale salad and the other was there chickpea salad. This place is definitely worth trying out. Very unique and done well, plus the staff was super helpful and friendly. I'd love to go back and try the breakfast sandwiches.",

I got the No. 33 Breakfast sandwich which included 2 poached eggs , fresh spinach ,feta cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes . The most unique thing about there sandwiches are that they are in mountain pies( campfire sandwiches) and so delicious , it reminded me of going camping during summer camp and making mountain pies around the campfire.  Thanks for helping reminisce on old times.   Beware during lunch you may have a hard time finding a parking spot in front , but there is always parking on the other side of flower child ,Or by see' s candies.  The staff was super friendly,  they have Wi-Fi here but unfortunately my computer wasn't letting me use it for some reason (famous: connected but no internet error).  Only thing I would have liked was to have outlets outside or inside (then again i didn't see any where I was seated) so that people could sit out side and work .",

    "text": "A wonderful, casual \"sandwich\" place.  My friend and I had ordered the #35 lunch sandwich and the #11 breakfast sandwich and traded halves.  We also got the #7 salad to share.  The lunch sandwich also came with a side of potato salad, so it was a bit of a sampler on my first time there.  Everything was excellent.  The owner picked up on my deer in headlights look and came out from behind the counter to explain the menu in a bit more detail.  I really appreciated that.   Apparently the breakfast sandwiches can have the eggs tailored if you prefer scrambled as opposed to poached/over-medium consistency.  There are some spicy items, which I did refrain from because I knew my friend wasn't a fan and we'd be trading halves.  However, he must've missed the fact that there was horseradish in the lunch sandwich we picked...and although I detected it, he didn't seem to notice (or maybe didn't mind) so I assume spices here are not overpowering.  I will definitely be back if I am in the area.   The space itself is decorated in a homey, cute, cozy, charming way.  There ceiling fans inside keep the fresh air flowing in from the giant window-type bar area.  The 20 foot bench up against the wall provides seating for the east side of 5 different tables, and has cute accent pillows.  The vibe is chill, the clientele is a good mix  (young, old, hispanic, caucasian, families, lunch dates)",

I had the #11 and my wife the #10. We both enjoyed them but afterwards both questioned why they didn't have a grilled cheese with tomato soup. How good that would be with their pressed circle bread. There teas are awesome, similar to Flower Child. Even now Im looking at there menu and see sandwiches as high as #77, but there menu board only seems to have 2 or 3 columns.

Zookz offers a central location, plenty of parking, a fast-casual atmosphere, friendly service, free wifi, and indoor/outdoor seating.  The menu consists of a variety of moderately priced breakfast and lunch sandwiches and a couple of salads.  I went for a breakfast sandwich (#11).  Sadly, I wasn't overly impressed... I felt my sandwich lacked a ton of flavor despite having eggs, cheese, bacon, tomato, etc... I added sriracha sauce and gobbled it up regardless, but I don't know that I will rush back.  That being said, if sandwiches are your thing, this place is worth checking out.  I hope that you'll be more impressed than I was!",

It is a cast iron pressed sandwich that has a crust somewhere between a turnover and pita bread stuffed with fun lunch or breakfast items. Like today- we had #26 which is thin slices of ham, bacon, avocado, tomato, roasted potato slices and a buttermilk sauce. You also get a choice of side with the lunch sandwiches and they are delicious, I really like the potato salad.      It is fun and delicious, so check it out!

The portion looks pretty small at first but it definitely fills you up. The food service is pretty quick so it's perfect for in between work. The parking is alright - can be hard to find space during lunch time.",

I ordered a No. 66 with avacado  and Chipotle sauce.  Sooo...delicious!  Lots of flavor and filling.  The poached eggs are more on the firm side ao if you dont like runny egg yolk, you will be good with a breakfast sandwhich.  All sandwhiches are available to order at anytime and you can substitute all you like.   I also ordered the chocolate & coconut sandwhich for something sweet.  This had too much coconut for me.  I suggested to the staff to have a bannana foster one or a blueberry & cream cheese  one (like a danish) for those that want a little bit of sweet with their meal.    They have awesome herbal unsweetened ice tea.  You have to try a cup.",

But $9+ wasn't really what I was expecting for such a small portion.   Their house salad that comes with a sandwich....it's pretty basic & flavorless.

There are a bunch of different choices; we ordered one that had eggs, spinach, ham and sweet mustard in it. They press the sandwich into a closed circle, the bread was a good different, I can't place it but it was somewhere between a waffle and toast. The service was great and I appreciated the openness of the layout. Perfect breakfast and lunch spot. They even have mimosas which I heard were really good.

Zookz was $9 and the sandwiches are small with weird items on it. I am a foodie, we gave #20 and #26 a try. Both ham sandwiches were gross in flavor and quality, soggy, and one had obviously canned grainy black beans in it.  Now that my stomach hurts, I can say that I wish I could just rewind and never eat at this place in the first place.",

It's like uncrustables filled with the best stuff, and the back story is really cool (you can read it on the wall if you're so inclined) I'm not going to say I had a mimosa at 8 am on a Tuesday, but if I did, I would bet the passionfruit one was soooooo good. I don't eat meat, and the owner was super accommodating and made great suggestions. We did breakfast, mine was egg and cheese and avocado and a crazy good sauce, my friend got the frittata one because he doesn't like runny middle eggs but after, the owner told us we can get any Sammie  with harder cooked eggs. He loved his too. This is my new regular breakfast stop for sure",

I had the #15-- turkey, dried cranberries, almonds, shredded carrots, and curry sauce. All of the ingredients were really good but still not sure about the bread/wrap. Definitely unique, not offensive in any way, just don't know that I like it as much as regular good old fashioned bread. It's a nice change of pace at least. You also get a side salad or chips. I had the kale salad and it was quite tasty. Service is very friendly and they care about what they do so my review is really a 3.5.

The flavors were excellent and ingredients were fresh and crisp!  With placing my order to go, I did not get a good look at inside, however I did notice it was clean and open to the outside eating space in the front.

I used to love Bennigan's Monte Cristo sandwich but they went out of business quite some time ago and I couldn't find anything even remotely close afterward; Padre Murphy's Monte Cristo didn't cut it. Zookz' #30 with thinly sliced ham, brie, apricot preserves and roasted almonds isn't a Monte Cristo but it's just as tasty in it's own way. We will definitely be back to try everything on their menu - Zookz is that good! The Kale salad is awesome too. I have a feeling that everything will be delicious, no matter what we order. Thank you, Carol, for opening such a great restaurant! :0)",

Kenny was very helpful in suggesting what sandwiches were best to try. I ordered The Zinger (one of their most popular sandwiches posted on the wall) for breakfast tmrw & he made sure it was in a to go bag & not cut in half, that way you could heat it up with no issues for the next day. If you get a lunch sandwich you can combine it with a salad of your choice or a bag of chips. They have iced tea or you can choose a beverage from their fountain drinks. If you choose a breakfast sandwich, it's a la carte, so i suggest a lunch sandwich to experience the whole shebang! You don't want to cut yourself short on a foodie adventure. No one likes a person who half-asses anything. Go all out! Or be bold an order 2 sandwiches! They also have something sweet for those of you who are sweettooths.",

I also like the fact that they have a small sink near the soda dispenser so you can conveniently wash your hands without going all the way to the bathroom.

You can't really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but my personal favorite is the No. 20. I've been eating here since they were at the old location right on central, and the new location across the intersection is great! I was worried that with the move the place wouldn't be the same and that the expansion would negatively affect the quality and taste of the food, but it's still great! My only gripe with them is the size of their meals, it's just not enough for me. I am 6'5 with a big appetite so I rarely go when I'm really hungry. With that being said my girlfriend thinks the portions are perfect so don't let that stop you from going! Plus the owner is super nice! Enjoy!",

Lol- they make their sandwiches in a machine that transfers your meal into a pocket type of sandwich melt kind of like the grills Foreman makes. See, so I made that fun connection. However, the difference is the owner Carole is a gem. (Okay, maybe George is too but I don't know him personally or have ever met him before - Call me George Foreman the next time you are in Phx and Zooks is on me.- lol, silly me.)   After I walked in looking a little lost, a woman comes running over to me with a big grin on her face. She was so welcoming and explains the entire sandwich making process to me. I had no idea what to order so we began to chat. \"Wow, the staff here are so helpful and nice,\" I am thinking to myself. ( especially after I tell her I meant to go to another restaurant and found my way here by mistake. Well not really since Zooks was on the \"Gotta Try List\" anyway. I believe Karma led me here today ) Well, as it turns out this charming lady is to my great surprise the actual owner, Carole. She is so delightful, helpful and friendly. It is apparent Carole loves what she does and is proud of her place.   The breakfast sandwich I received was pretty tasty. They use Wildflower bread, Ummm, \"Yummers!\" I can't wait to come back and try all of the different menu item sandwiches. I read all these great comments on the Kale salad so I will have to try that too.   The only thing you might want to note is that the sandwiches are smaller than the average way too big portions we seem to be familiar with in America. I was thrilled myself. However, some other people who do not know any better might be forewarned.   Thank you Carole and the pleasure was all mine to meet you. Just a note, I never made it to the other restaurant at all. I might never with you nearby.",

The coffee was good, however it was almost as expensive as the sandwhich. 3 stars  To make it even worse, the owner came up trying to beg us to correct the issue. As we were walking out, the cooks and cashier starred us down. Wont be coming back here. As a professional yelper, zookz has failed.",

Didn't get in the door a half a second and was met by a bubbly counter lady, Stacie,  who was generous with her happiness. It was nice to see a pleasant face first thing in the morning. She educated me on all their  sandwiches and explained which was best for breakfast and what her favorite was. She even got the cooks in the back the smile while they are making my sandwich.  I had the Zinger, which is a breakfast sandwich and I was trying to figure out how to come back for lunch. They have a large door open between the outdoor and indoor area where you can sit outside or inside, I sat in between and enjoyed the train and the outside air while I ate he delicious pocket like sandwich. This place is a little jewel right off of Central Avenue and Camelback and should really be much busier then it was.  I will definitely start recommending this place and bring friends by, maybe even for lunch today.",

Yes, boiled eggs are usually an indication of dry things to come, but it seemed worth the risk. The balance of sauce and other ingredients produce an independent item with near perfect new flavors.    About the only thing better than the food is the service. The staff is friendly, patient, and helpful - in a natural unforced manner.   On a side note: food, especially sandwiches and/or eggs, are generally either not photogenic (see: any place with pictures on the menu) or look over produced (Barbara Walters lens filter with a side of vibrant greens for a youthful effect). Zookz somehow cracked the code - the pictures are great.  Great job!",

Zooks is kinda like a Cornish Pasty co. on the go and less hearty. Although, I believe Zooks food is completely fresh. I will most likely be back and would recommend this place to others. For breakfast the number 11. sandwich is great.

We split #35 and 20, roast beef and turkey. Both very unique!  Skip subway or McDonalds for lunch. Try Zookz. Sandwiches are a cross between a grilled cheese, pita pocket and calzone.

I tend to get the 20 or 25, but I've never had a bad sandwich. The sandwiches are all full of flavor because of all the ingredients and healthy (well, maybe not the Nutella one, but that's understandable). One complaint I see here is the crust, but I've never had a problem with it. I personally find it just fine and its part of what makes the sand which unique. My only complaint here is the sandwiches are small, so if I'm particularly hungry I'll order two. However, I usually can't decide between two sandwiches so this is just fine with me! I'd highly recommend Zookz!",

They also have sweet sandwiches as well if you've got a sweet tooth. We are only in town for a couple days and loved this place so much we are coming back again tomorrow. If we lived in the area this would definitely be one of my regular spots. Also to note the owner is super sweet and her staff is very friendly. They are pretty quick in the kitchen as well so if you don't have a lot of time this is a great place to grab a quick bite. Enjoy! You will not be disappointed.",

The staff was friendly and the interior was clean bright and breezy from the open doors letting in the fresh air and light. It felt almost like being on a patio instead of indoors. He ordered the #25 and I ordered the #35. Both were delicious, if somewhat smaller than expected. For a light lunch the size is perfect,  especially if you have the kale salad alongside it. I actually liked the kale salad so much I decided to ask if I could get a larger order to go to have as a healthy snack while at work.  The owner came by our table to personally ask how we enjoyed our food. I told her how much I enjoyed the salad and asked her if they sold a larger portion to go. She informed me they didn't, but would happily pack one for me. That's what I call great service! I found her very friendly and accommodating. I was pleasantly surprised...There aren't that many owners who take the time or care to go around personally asking customers how their experience was...that's a great way to keep people coming back.  Overall my friend and I enjoyed Zookz and will be back.   By the way: If you check in on foursquare you can get 15% off your meal...also on yelp if you check in, they give you 10% off.",
