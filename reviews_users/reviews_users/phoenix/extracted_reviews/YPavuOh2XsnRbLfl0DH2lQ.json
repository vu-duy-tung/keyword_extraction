We had about a 15 minute wait at lunch time which isn't too bad. This isn't your normal place you would figure for chicken and waffles. It's actually quite fancy, they have valet parking and a nice outdoor seating area while you wait for your table. We also had an excellent server. They are all hustling in an efficient manner. Everything done pretty well at this place. I would recommend to anyone.",

The place is small and quaint but definitely has a lot of character. First thing I noticed was that the whole staff was really friendly, welcoming, and attentive.   We came here for chicken and waffles so that's what we ordered. However, there was so much more on the menu that I seemed appetizing. The sweet tea came out in large jars. Nice! I had the 3 pc chicken and 2 waffles smothered in gravy and onions. My friends had the same without the gravy. The food came out quickly and piping hot! Whatever is in their seasoning, it was so good! The gravy and onions were even better! I could probably have done without one less waffle, but oh well, I was on vacation.  Lo-Lo's is definitely up there for me in terms of best chicken and waffles. I'd come here again if I'm in Phoenix.",

Parking is nearly impossible and their entire parking lot is valet...so you'll need to park on the surrounding streets, or pay. The restaurant was really busy when we were there and the food took a little while, but not a big deal. I had the omelette and it was huge!! It was really good and I took most of our home and easily have another couple meals with it. When it came time to go, we asked for a refill and was told that they weren't free. Seriously?! I can't remember being in a place that didn't offer free refills. Overall the staff was alright, but I actually like the atmosphere at Mrs. White's is a lot better and everybody is really friendly.",

It is delicious and filling.  Today I decided to try something different and ordered  the chicken sandwich. It 's so big I couldn't finish it, but it was also very good.  It comes close to my favorite dish the Betty Boop.  I would also like to mention the staff is always friendly.",

I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!  We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!  We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the \"Nay Nay's\" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...  So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!    I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!",

My waffle had a scoop of butter that was twice the size of a golf ball, The chicken was so crispy and flavorful, not too spicy or salty but just right, it wasn't even greasy.  My Husband got the same with a side of cheesy eggs, He was lickin' his fingers and bobbin' his head.....so what does that tell ya!  All in all it was the best we've ever had, We Will be Going back!

Cake is loosely used to define this...thing. It tasted like raw biscuit dough. It was wet, mushy, and the only flavor was red food dye. Even the frosting was terrible. *sigh*  BUT! The chicken fried chicken was fantastic, the candy sweets and collards were great. And the cornbread was darn tasty. And, hey, you serve me a refreshing beverage in a Mason jar, and I'm a happy camper. I ate like a pig, left full as a tick and still have a doggy bag with half my food waiting for me in the fridge.

    "text": "First time at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. Absolutely not my last!  I arrived at 6 on a Tuesday night and it was very busy. Got my table and scanned the huge menu. Settled on the server's recommendation: the Soulfood Platter. It came with several options so I chose three pieces of fried chicken, cornbread and two sides (I chose Mac N Cheese plus Collard Greens)  I added an iced tea for a total of $20.04 plus tip.   My dinner arrived in about 8-10 mins. The pressure-cooked chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The cornbread was okay. The corn kernels added a nice touch but honey would've made it better. The Mac was okay. It needed toasted bread crumbs for finish. Nice and creamy tho. Never had collard greens before-they were excellent. Kinda like if spinach and cabbage had a baby. They add bacon and red pepper flakes here (not much tho), so it had a good smoky flavor.   The service was exceptional and I had no qualms over any part of the meal.   I highly recommend Lolo's for a filling, tasty southern  dinner!",

Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!  I had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- \"Tre-tre\" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!  Service is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.  I'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.  O:^)",

Although compared to may as a Roscoe's knock off, I personally enjoyed Lolo's over Roscoe's. Just sayin. Chicken was well seasoned and full of flavor. Mad respect to the chef. Waffle was cooked right, the mac n cheese was just like how mom makes it. My stomach enjoyed every bite. Only issue I had was the wait. Although we were added to the waitlist through Yelp (shout out to Yelp), we still waited curiously as we saw plenty of tables available. But that was my only issue. The service was good and very nice. This will now be a regular visit for me now.",

This last time I was standing in line to get my name on the list and somehow larger parties that came in behind me got put on the list before I was acknowledged at all despite being right there at the stand. I tried to say something, got a server's attention and not the hostess, she scribbled my name down on something, but it definitely wasn't the waiting list to be seated, so we left. Sorry I'm not a family of 7 and just a party of 2 (and white, I guess?).  Prior, it's been the same \"I've got better things to do than help you\" attitude, mostly from the female staff. Servers and host. Male staff is usually fine, so I'm not sure why there's an attitude there. Friends that have gone before also have noted the attitude of the female staff and it's not a case of \"if everyone you talk to is an a-hole, you're the a-hole.\"  Food quality can be hit or miss, too. Kool-Aid is far too sweet (universal across all locations) and I find myself ordering a water to dilute about 30-50% if I did order it. Breasts have been dry, except once. Thighs usually stay juicy, but I've had a couple dry ones as well. Pancakes are alright. Waffles seem like a pancakes in waffle form. Collard green are delicious. The banana pudding, though... That's going to be a hard one to break up with.",

The waffle is the perfect portion size (I only got 1 and I couldn't even finish it). + Fried Green Tomatoes. Mmmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmmmm! 4 pieces in a basket, that's perfect for sharing but you might not want to share after you taste how good they are! + Biscuits and gravy. Ugh. Can we stop here?! Seriously.. this was. so. good! Fresh fluffy biscuits smothered in gravy. This was delicious, but I was really hoping for a deeper brown kind of gravy - this one was more white. Nevertheless it was still GOOD!  Drinks. + They come in the largest sized mason jars - love, love, love it!  I love their menu options. They have mixed up almost every combo you can think of. Now mind you, they're a chicken and waffles place so if you order something other than, it may take a while to get your food. Just saying.. Also, they serve breakfast all day (winner, winner chicken dinner)!  If you're in the neighborhood and want some soul food, this is it!

The waiting is not the bad thing it was the attitude of the hostesses there.   I'm from out of state and I've never been to Lolos I was excited to eat there as their menu has a lot of variety and delicious things.  Back to the stank attitudes, we had a large party their waiting area is small we were constantly harassed to move out of the entry which we were not blocking. By he tried to make us go outside in 106 wether.  Sorry I'm not used to that heat and even with misters outside I was not going to go.   The approach and attitude these girls oozed was just plain Ghetto.  Their tone, body language and demeanor was just foul!  Their manager Antjuan (the one with the gold grill) also not helpful.  I recommend instead of adding more gold on his teeth he invest in toothpaste and breath mints the odor seeping from his mouth when speaking was horrendous!    When we finally got situated everything was great the server was awesome and he is the only reason I am giving u two stars!  Food was delicious our server was great but it's the hostesses that need people skills there was about 4 or 5 girls but these two where the worst!!!!",

They have nice outdoor seating and the decor was great.  Loved the music they played (uncensored) had that IDGAF vibe.    Down to the nitty gritty......the food!  First off we were told upon walking in that their chicken delivery truck was in a wreck and they were running dangerously low on all chicken but wings.  It was great for them to let us know off the bat but sad to think of all that could have been with that chicken.  We tried a couple drinks and had the two two (two waffles and two chicken wings) and the D man (waffle and fried catfish).  Everything was superb.  Waffles were done great, the syrup they use was excellent and the chicken, although small, was finger licking!  The drinks were made fast and fresh and came out in ball jars.

I indulged in a nice country style meal (pic below) and was thoroughly satisfied. I didn't feel as if I had missed out on the chicken and waffles because my plate was so good. For dessert, if you like banana pudding, definitely give it a try. It tastes great and has a good ratio of bananas to cookies. On top of that, it's served in a mason jar!   Service here is great.

I asked the waitress what flavors they had and she replied \"red, blue and grape!,\" I had to ask if those were the colors or the flavor, then she gave me the flavors...can you say RACHET?!

The collard greens were the highlight, very spicy with some kick. The fried chicken was flavorful but on the greasy side.  Give me a minute to elaborate. One *expects* a substance fried in grease to be ....greasy. But that's not necessarily the case. You can fry something to a crisp, it can still be juicy/moist on the inside, without being sopping or dripping in grease.  That said, the chicken wasn't soggy by any means. There was still some crisp to it. I licked my fingers when the meal was done.  A nibble of the cornbread and it tasted like nothing special but nothing abysmal. Oh, there were some dry smothered potatoes.  For a to-go order, I was pleased they packed the chicken in foil so that my greens didn't leak onto everything else.  Speed, packing, service bump this up to 4 stars. Food alone merits 3 stars.",

The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?  RIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day. I literally dipped my entire meal (waffles, grits, eggs) in this gravy and still couldn't get enough.  My only grip is that the Lo-lo's in Scottsdale takes amex, but this one doesn't. =(.  But seriously, Lo-lo's....could eat it every day. IN fact, we we're here for one week, and at Lo-lo's twice.  Oh yeah, the Red Velvet cake is RIDICULOUS.",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here while vacationing in the Phoenix area. It is in the \"hood\" but the inside is really nice. There were multiple tvs showing football games on this busy Sunday afternoon.  It was very crowded and the wait was about 40 minutes.  When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a \"two-fer\" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.  I had to ask several times what a \"two-fer\" was before she finally responded and said a table for two. We took that table and it was TINY! I would have liked to have been asked from the beginning if we were ok with sitting outside rather than almost being threatened (which is what it sounded  and felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional.   Ok so the food....I had chicken and waffles.  The good: the chicken wasn't by Banquet.  You could tell it was the kind your mother chopped up and fried fresh. The bad: The chicken lacked flavor. The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C. I think it is very overrated or maybe there just aren't many options in Phoenix.   The service...two different ladies served us but once our food came, they forgot about us. A man I'm assuming is the manager walked by and offered us drink refills after our glasses sat empty for 10-15 minutes.  Overall...a so-so experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I wouldn't throw a tantrum if this is where a friend wanted  to dine.",

The place was busy when I came, but there was no wait and I was seated immediately. After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, \"oh, you want desert?\" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.  I will never return. I think if I had gotten an apology for the service then I would have been a bit appeased. No apology was offered by anyone. Not the hostess, not the server, nor management.  As for the food, I think if I were placed in a blind taste test between Lolo's and KFC, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Maybe it's because the service left such a terrible taste in my mouth, but I will never return to find out.  The only positives to my experience was that I liked the atmosphere and the waitress kept my glass full, which is the only reason I tipped her.  Okay, that's the end of my rant. I hope you all have a better experience than I did.",

We thought it should be a light business that time of the week but soon discovered our mistake. This location seems to always be busy. By the time we were seated, received our food, paid our tab, and left it was 6:45 and the place was nearly empty. In fairness there were nine in our party and a group like that doesn't just fit anywhere but it's still disheartening to watch people arrive an hour after you and get seated immediately.  Food from the kitchen also was slow to arrive but, {and here is where the good news starts} it was very good! We started with three appetizers, spicy corn fritters, fried green tomatoes, and fried green beans. I felt the beans were kind of bland but the corn fritters were tasty with the right amount of heat and the tomatoes were excellent. I had decided on a beer and after ordering 3 different kinds with all being unavailable I settled for a glass of ice water. My co-diners raved about the sweet tea and kool aid drinks. Most of my party ordered a variable of the signature chicken and waffles which we all enjoyed. My chicken tenders and waffle were very good. I like the breading and size of the tenders and the waffle was very tasty with a mound of soft sweet butter and a good syrup. I would recommend Lo Lo's and would give it 5 stars if the service {which was good} wasn't so slow and parking were less of a problem.",

    "text": "This review breaks my heart.   A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!  That's about where the love ends with this review sadly.   We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did.   When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI.   Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh?  My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that?   Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves. Not cool Lolo's, not cool at all. I think its rad that you expanded, but if you cant handle the customer load then whats the point?",

Back home Roscoes chicken and waffles is our spot and I'm proud to say that Lolo's will be our spot whenever we come to Phoenix. Their Kool aid reminded me of my childhood  on a hot summer day. Great food. Excellent service. Nice environment.",

    "text": "BLUF Got it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful.   Background Yelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.    The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.  It too lacked flavor, was heavy beyond understanding and it hurts me to say this - was only deserving of the trash. wa, wa, waaaa.  $20+ for soul food that was so bad.",

    "text": "It truly breaks my heart to write this review. I had such high hopes for my family's dining experience. I convinced them to wait 50 minutes for a table, once we were seated we waited 20 minutes to have our drink orders taken and I purposely instructed my family to have their dining options chosen by the time our waitress returned. When she returned we placed our order, my son was told there were no burgers or pancakes because the flat grill was out of order - we improvised; and proceeded to enjoy the decor, pictures on the wall, signatures of various celebrity patrons and just overall atmosphere. 45 minutes later we were still waiting and even our appetizers hadn't made it out the kitchen. Meanwhile another family was sat directly behind us and had just placed their order. We arrived simultaneously with the family across from us and the family adjacent to us had already been seated when we arrived. When food did begin to arrive over an hour later,  it was that of the family across from us even though the family adjacent to us had been there and ordered first and the orders and priority in which they came out just got worse. When my food did come there was collard greens and all the juices on my plate. I explained I didn't order collars greens and was told it was probably put there because they ran out of Potato salad !? The chicken we were told was coming out fresh and that's why our area was waiting and it came our burned. I'm okay with you running out of things but not assuming I eat collard greens. The juices from them made my cornbread soggy and ran off onto my fish. So not only do I not eat collars greens but now the juices are touching everything I do eat.  Final straw was once most of the food made it to the table, my husband was still without his meal even though he and my girls ordered the same thing. But the table with the family that came in AFTER us was already being attended to for dessert!! I immediately asked for boxes and instructed my family to get ready to leave. Bottom line the food is delicious, but the service and attention to detail was by far the worst I've had in awhile. We didn't spend a few dollars on this dining experience and not only that we still had the common courtesy to leave a tip. There was no apologies for the horrible service, and our funds were collected as if 5 star customer service was delivered. We are from California so this was our first and last impression. Very disappointed.",

We ordered their bottomless mimosas and it was mostly orange juice and cheap champagne. But it did its job.  As for the chicken and waffles, they were super yum. The waffles were on the flatter side and I would have liked them a little more fluffy. But that's okay. Definitely recommend this place!",

The food tasted just the same throughout the three stores.  I ordered a child's quesadilla which my niece gobbled up all too quickly. (Good thing) The other child I was caring for did not fancy her peanut butter jelly and banana sandwich. (Not so good) I ordered the chicken thigh catfish collard greens and mac & cheese and red kool aid.  The chicken tasted as if it was fried in old grease the collards were way too salty and the Mac & cheese tasted as if it was mixed with a can of cheese sauce. Even after being watered down the Kool-Aid was still way too sweet and powdery as if they used one entire pack of Kool-Aid per jar. Nothing tasted authentic as to have been made from scratch from big mamas kitchen. The service was on point though, the staff was very accommodating and accepting of the constructive criticism. The atmosphere is very lively the restaurant is clean and welcoming, it does have a family feel to it What I didn't like was eagerly taken off the bill or traded for something different. I know everyone's taste buds are different but for me these restaurants do nothing for my taste buds but anger them.",

But minus 1 start for not having chicken gizzards,   They were the only reason I went.    I've been looking for a restaurant that serves fried gizzards (po' folks closed about 20 yrs ago so yes I've been searching that long.)  They should either choose smaller mason jars for drinks or get ones with handles, (so any people have hand issues with computers and smartphones causing hand issues) that trying to hold a fat mason jar with hands greasy from chicken is difficult.",

The server was very kind, but waited over an hour between being seated, and getting food. An hour long wait, with only drinks on the table was absolutely infuriating! There was zero communication from the staff about the wait. I had to go and ask for the manager. None of the other tables were served either, it wasn't just us. My drink (blue koolaid) tasted like it had been mixed with an old rag. I also specifically asked for \"no mushrooms\" and the dish came loaded with mushrooms. I picked them out and pushed them to the side since I was absolutely starving by the time they brought the food, and I didn't want to send the dish back. Before they brought the food, the waitress said they would bring us cornbread, but they never did. A table next  to us with people that arrived after us got cornbread, but we got air to eat for an hour on a Sunday. Charles the manager only came out after we ate, and then told us there was a problem in the kitchen. He should have told us in the beginning that we were in for an hour wait. That way we could have gone somewhere else, or known what to expect. Very rude to make hungry people wait. Poor communication. Didn't leave the restaurant until 2PM.",

The waffles are like none I've ever tasted. Delicious, cinnamon bread-like and definitely plentiful. This along with 3 pieces of chicken. The chicken was fresh and crispy. Flavorful without being overly salty. Definitely homemade but not quite as down-home feeling as a couple of other nearby places we tried as well.  Definitely glad we came and would recommend trying it out without reservation.",

I can wait for my server for a minute till I spot them in the crowd or not see them for 15 minutes while I wait to pay and leave.   The food is pretty good. The place I trust for some hearty southern food! Their macaroni and shrimp is great! Comes with a biscuit but to be warned, it is extremely filling. I can't even finish half my plate.  Corn bread is always a favorite for me when I go!  Chicken is pretty moist depending on the piece you get. I usually go for thighs since I like dark meat.  Waffles are yummy yummy too and I don't really need syrup for it!   Overall, great food, just hit or miss service which can be disappointing :(",

    "text": "First and foremost, I want to write about the Poetry on First Friday from 7/7. There was a poet there. She reminded me of actress Samira Wiley. I didn't get her name, but I hope she reads this. I liked her poem. It was about regretting saying \"I Love You\" in the heat of \"the moment\" when you didn't really mean it. I liked her words. I think she's good. She just needs to slow down, and recite it with the passion in which she wrote it. I'm sorry she didn't get the reaction she wanted from the crowd. In all honesty, the dinnertime family rush is probably not the most appreciative crowd for her genre. She talked about grown-up subject matter in a crowd of parents and kids. It understandably made them uncomfortable. To the poet, please keep at your art! Find a better venue, but definitely don't give up.   So, the food was great. Nothing fancy, but definitely satisfying. My husband got a bacon burger, and he didn't complain, which is HUGE for him. My 5 year old had never had banana on a pb&j, and he loved it. He's been asking for them ever since. The other kiddos ordered mac and cheese, and loved it.   I had the chicken and waffles, and what's not to love? And, you can't go wrong with Kool-aid.   Great atmosphere. Great for kids. I would stick to dining during daylight hours at this location. There was a not-so-undercover cop posted up right in front. I mean, I felt safe inside, but the neighborhood is a little skeevy.",

Grits were exactly how they listed them- plain. With a slab of margarine. I prefer butter. And they really were gritty no smoothness. Eggs were fried in margarine as well. So I'd stay away from it next time.   A lot of carbs: waffles were soggy. They need to stand up to the chicken but didn't. Brother ordered the biscuits and they were giant fist sized and smothered in gravy.   Chicken with their hot sauce was the best thing there. Definitely would advise to stick with just the chicken unless you're a fan of margarine and/or massive amounts of carbs. I love the concept of chicken and waffles (live in LA with the famous Roscoe's, which I don't recommend either) but the waffles always seems to disappoint. It's chicken and waffles. Not chicken with pancakes.   Parking is plentiful. Also have a bike station around the corner if biking is more your thing than the walk/drive.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up and report back to me! :)",

The grits were topped with shredded cheddar cheese , bacon ( real hunks of bacon people) green onions and a dusting of some sort of creole seasoning. I was dying to lick my bowl once I was done eating !! My mom had the 3 piece fried chicken with 2 sides (rice and gravy & potatoes and gravy) and a corn muffin. The chicken was seasoned and fried to perfection .. my mom insisted that the corn muffin was the best she's ever had . She said it was cake like and sweet.  Drinks are served in mason jars so there is almost never a need for a refill. Service is great, ambiance is gorgeous, and all the staff seem friendly and menu knowledgeable",

A lot of my friends mothers would cook great soul food and this reminds me of when I was a kid.  Today was my second visit to this place. It was as good or better than the first time a few months ago. This time I have the \"Betty Boop\", a single waffle, with a huge chicken breast, with a side of bacon and a side of fried Okra. I was full half way through but kept eating because it was all sooo good!!! If your on a diet this can't be the best place to go, but if your skipping a day on your diet, or just don't care, then get over to this place for great food. It is located in the ghetto, but the place is very clean and the staff is friendly. Everyone is happy because of the great food and people!!",

The cornbread, although a bit dry, totally hit the spot with the Kool-Aid.  The waffles and eggs (I ordered the \"Lil Jay\") were both hot and fresh and delicious.  Amazing!

    "text": "I'm from LA, and I LOVE Rosco's Chicken and Waffles. I was apprehensive about this place, based on high expectations, which I hold from Rosco's. However, Lolo's was THE JAM!  The parking = easier and better and safer than Rosco's (any location)  The wait = only 20 minutes on a Saturday morning at 10am. Rosco's would have been at least 45 minutes.  The service = friendly and welcoming. They had no intention of rushing us out of there, even though there was a wait list at the host stand. I could tell that our server (Sarah, I think) wanted us to have a comfortable, relaxing meal.  The food = Just as good as Rosco's (which means, superb!). I ordered the #10, which is two chicken legs and a waffle. The chicken was insanely buttery and moist, with perfect crispy crust. The waffle was short, flat, covered in butter, and accompanied by piping-hot syrup. That's exactly how I like it.  I also asked our server for an order of her favorite side dish, and she brought me a side of collared greens, which were the best I've ever had. They were buttery, crisp, and somehow spicy. I asked one of the other employees how they got the spice, and he said it's crushed red pepper flakes, though he seemed unsure. Whatever it is, it's heaven.  This place is worth a trip, and definitely worth the cost.  Thank you Lolo's!",

After waiting for a few minutes a few folks started arriving so we figured it will open soon. When it opened we were really surprised how many tables it held as it looks like it might fit three at best. Now mind you it is not huge, but larger than it looks. There were five of us and we fit well. We were greeted by a very nice young lady. In fact I would say this place has the cutest staff around. What I mean by that is they were all smiling friendly adorable folks. We ordered our food and were attended to for drinks. Very large mason jars are used for the drinks and filled to the top. The food came. Four of us chicken and waffles and one had the rice and gizzards with gravy. We all loved the chicken, very tasty and quite crispy. Three of us liked the waffles, I being the dissenter. There was nothing wrong with them, it is just personal taste. I did not like the cinnamon added. We all took a bite of the rice and gizzards. Really good flavour with wonderful gravy. A good time had by all.",

    "text": "The first place in two weeks where I've felt welcome in Phoenix!   My boyfriend finally came to visit, and after my two trying weeks of lectures and starting student-teaching, I wanted a treat, even though I had just caught a cold from one of my students. We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions.   After probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice).   Okay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it.   The price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert.",

    "text": "I've been waiting forever to try chicken and waffles and I'm so glad Lo-Lo's was the spot to pop my chicken and waffles cherry.   It's a humble restaurant in the middle of nowhere, which, had it not been for the huge text sprawled on the side of a building, we would have never noticed the tiny entrance.   I came here with my girlfriend while visiting her at institute and this was one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the area so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a try.   The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather.   The space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours.   The food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:  1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.  Soul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant.   Red Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant.   In regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans.   Sweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing.   One regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake.   The food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy.   The reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone in town!",

After a super hot day of walking through the Botanical Gardens, the only thing that got me through was thinking about checking out Lo-Lo's and the let me tell you that they didn't disappoint!  The place was packed at 5pm but we luckily got in super fast.  Our table tried a little bit of everything.  The Chicken and Waffles, Fried Catfish, Fried Redfish, Collard Greens, and the Gizzards.  Let me start with my favorite, the fried chicken.  Delicious!!  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.    I'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.  The service was great as well.  Enjoy the ambiance b/c it was authentic and the people that waited on us were awesome.  I'll be making Lo-Lo's a permanent stop on all my trips back to Phoenix!!",

    "text": "Went there Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were quickly seated. I was thankful that it was not packed with lines like some of the reviews implied. I think maybe the downtown parade had something to do with it. Phew! Ordered the Lolo's chicken and waffles. Came with a breast, a wing, and a thigh. The skin was crunchy and yummy, a tad on the greasy side but still very good. The waffles with butter and syrup was very yummy. Although I think I expected more waffle/crunchy texture and not as more like pancake type of soft texture. But it's still good. I'd definitely go back! I still liked Roy Rogers fried chicken from the east coast way back when the best in my distorted and disillusioned memory. But this chicken is definitely very good.",

After an hour and 15 minute wait, ask the host if they planned on sitting us and he replied \"you can't walk in at 8 o'clock and expect to be seated right away\". Not the answer to give when hosting. Oh, we walked in at 7, was told a 45 minute wait which ended up being an hour an 1/2.  Overall, the rave about this place is beyond me. Slow service, poor host, average food.",

Oh my goodness! They were the special appetizer. And man, were they good! I tried the sauce, but I liked them better without it. They were tart and the paprika added such a great flavor to them that four wasn't enough.  The chicken and grits were fantastic as always.  My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the macaroni and cheese. I eat it like dessert. I could get just that.  Lo-Lo's is one of the main things that I miss in Phoenix.

This yr, they rebuilt and EVERY single staff member acted too good or busy.. including the owner. I ordered a SALAD . HOW HARD IS A SALAD WITH CHICKEN. NEVER CAME the owner was very rude and did not care. I will never go again.   One thing people shouldn't do is forget who you are, WHERE you came from and WHO got you there.

I came at an off-peak time, so the place was fairly empty. The staff was SUPER attentive. I placed my order quickly, but held onto the menu to continue looking over it. Because of the menu still being on my table, I literally got asked by every employee if I was ready to order yet. I guess they don't have sections?  The food was pretty tasty. Fried chicken was done well and decently sized (not big, not small). Taste-wise, they were solid but not the best I've ever had. The waffles rivaled those found at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles... delicious! The sweet tea was done pretty well... just the right amount of sweetness. Overall, I was pretty pleased with how everything turned out. Solid place, but not the best I've ever had... thus 4 stars.  L oved the waffles. O rder fast and give back the menu or you'll keep getting asked. L iked the chicken... but didn't blow my mind. O verall worth a visit with solid food and nice people.",

Whenever I eat at one of the \"okay\" soul food places I think: why can't they be as good as Lo-Lo's? And then I start dreaming of Lo-Lo's Soul Food Platter with smothered fried chicken and waffles. It's so much food I can't finish it. But who doesn't love leftovers? You get A LOT of bang for your buck and the service is superb. They really make you feel at home, great hospitality. I never have room for dessert so I get the red velvet cake and whatever other delicious dessert special they have to go. Speaking of red velvet cake, I never liked that cake till I had it at Lo-Lo's. There's something special about their version of that cake. With my bag of leftovers and dessert to go I end up eating all over again around midnight munchie time...heaven!  Fortunately I have family in Tucson so I purposely fly into Phoenix and hit Lo-Lo's before going to Tuscon. And I try to schedule my flight out around Lo-Lo's too. That's how much I love Lo-Lo's. See you in February--can't wait! Drooling until then...",

I've been to this location on multiple occasions and have always spent tons of money with my wife on meals and yet the last two times I've been here I've being treated very rudely and made to wait for cold food. The first occasion I ordered to go, I ordered ahead of time to make sure that it would be ready they said it would be ready around 12:20pm i got there at 12:10pm the food was already bagged up and sitting there cold the waffle cold and like rubber they might I add they forgot my cornbread and my waffle I had to go out to my car and look in the bag to notice they weren't in the bag after paying my $17.00 for it. I got to work I was on my lunch break and called to reach out to their manager who asks me to come back but I told him I only had a 30 min lunch and couldnt return until after 6pm and he said thats fine but wanted the food. I couldnt come by after work as I had to pick up my kids from daycare on the other side of town then he ignore my attempts to reach out to him until today 12/6/2015 I called him and he said he would not replace my food as they get calls like mine all the time and that he'd do something nice for us but not replace the food I said thats fine I'm coming in with my wife Ill see you in a minute. We get there are seated at 5:35pm we explain that I'd like to see the manager the waitress then says ok I will get him, she asks us what we want to drink we order a water and a sweet tea and we wait 15 mins for our drinks ready to order we see her help everyone else and even brings us napkins after 15 mins! and doesnt ask us for our order or even bring us our drinks! We had to ask a nice young man by the name of Jacquan who immediately helped us pt in our order, then the waitress suddenly shows up with our drinks and seems upset she says I talked to the manager and he just said he'd give you a dessert, so instead of confronting and greeting his guest he hides behind his staff and doesn't even come out and speak to us. Then the waitress who is now upset doesnt speak to us for the rest of the night. Meanwhile we wait and see everyone else already eating a person who was seated just before us already eating and almost done it is now 6:45pm and we have not even received our appetizer we ordered nor our food everyone is now leaving as they were closing at this time cleaning and putting up chairs around us. We finally receive our food and my plattter which includes cornbread, doesnt have cornbread they tell me that they are out of cornbread, wow so I come here already have a bad previous experience my food isnt replaced and to top it off they are out of the food I ordered. They then bring my wifes food which is a chili bowl and its frozen cold and has cold non melted cheese on top as if it had been sitting in the window until our chicken was done then they just threw some cheese on it, ridiculous.... To make things worst theres now only three people in the resteraunt they are paying their bills and we barely receiving our food now feel rushed as the entire staff keeps looking at us basicaly wanting to leave so we did'nt even get to enjoy our meal we just paid $30.00 for that was cold my wife didnt even eat because she didnt want to put in another order and make everyone wait for us as we already waiting an hour for cold food and no cornbread.... The chicken is great but they service needs to be taken up there should be a certain standards to the quality of service they are giving to their loyal paying customers.",

    "text": "\"Mason jars make me excited\"  This was one of those places you get excited about because it's soul food in the south.. well not sure if you would call Phoenix the south, but you get the point.   This place is a solid 3.5 for the food experience, but when I think about round up or round down, the other touches allow me to comfortably nudge this place to a 4.  +Service was amazing. I appreciate other waiters asking do you need anything. Sometimes your server can get caught up and you are left waiting. Equally important, the server had an opinion. The worst thing is when you ask someone about an item and they shrug their shoulders. +Food came out pretty quickly and nice and warm. I order the mix - fried chicken and a piece of catfish with greens, red potatoes and green beans, and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the fish was tasty, the chicken was better than okay but not great.. and the greens/green beans were just okay. I ordered the red velvet as well and well.. how can you NOT have cream cheese frosting. After letting it sit a day I liked it more.. but something was missing.  +Mason Jars: Yes, folks, this deserved it's own line. A place totally rocks when they serve your drink in a mason jar! I loved it. If I wanted a sugar rush, I could have ordered the kool-aid. That's awesomeness.  Even with the slightly above average food experience, I would totally go back and continue to explore the menu. I will say I was a fan of their hot sauce. It has the right amount of kick to it.",

But we did eat here.  And the food was really good. If I didnt know any better I would say there's nothing different between roscoes chicken and Lo Lo's or the waffle which is a good thing to me. I suggest not ordering the \"breakfast potatoes' they were frozen potatoes that had been deep fried with sauteed peppers and onion thrown on top they look a lot better then they actually were. This place has one up on Roscoe's by giving unlimited refills on the kool aid. They had purple (grape), red (fruit punch), and lemonade. And they serve it in large cups like the ones you get at lucilles Bbq.   This will become the \"usual\" the more I go to AZ.",

I come here for the chicken and that did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The waffles seemed a little overdone, so I ended up eating only half of it.  I had some mac and cheese which was great, so that made up for the waffle.    The service was prompt and attentive, so no problems there.  However, I don't agree with the 18% gratuity for a group of 5 people, but I'm guessing it's to ensure people tip.  Since the service was great I have no problem paying 18%, but I would prefer that the amount to tip be my decision for a group of less than 7 or 8.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Whites, and this is a chip off the ol' block, but with a twist. The fried chicken is tender and juicy inside while perfectly crispy on the outside. Great flavor as well, and not dripping with grease. The green beans are perfection! Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and had a slight kick (heat) to them. The mac and cheese was also delicious. The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event. So,note to self,  don't take pictures after eating the cake and be cautious if you're on a first date. If he or she is giggling while looking at you, it's not because you're funny (well, your are, but not for the reasons you think). Service was alright, considering how busy it was.   The HUGE negative is that I came on a Saturday and the ENTIRE parking lot (mind you it's really small) is valet. So, you're paying additional money to eat here on the weekend. You could choose to park along the street or in front of someone's home, but  I'm not sure how safe the area is. It's so busy on the weekend parking is limited. We got there around 10:30am and parked  close by and waited about 15 minutes for a table. There's a very small waiting area inside. Most people had to wait outside, which was fine since the weather is nice. But in the summer and winter, this could be an issue. Was it worth it?  Ohhhh, yeah!",

However, I only got my original coffee and was never asked for a refill.    To the reviews saying the red rooster sauce is spicy or even tasty for that matter, \"what's up with that? /snl\"  It's of the same ilk as a frank's hot sauce, but with even less presence.      Chicken and waffle was good - nothing life changing or worth writing home about.  There's no exotic spices/combos to speak of, you're basically just paying for the novelty of having chicken & waffles on the same plate whenever you damn well please.  3 stars because to me soul food should be more than just breading chicken and throwing it into a fryer.  I'd give it 4 stars for the novelty, but Tuck Shop has a chicken&waffle plate that is in another class, albeit pricier.",

Back then (although my memory fades), the shack was still there and this joint was in it's infancy and both the atmosphere and food were memorable in that fried, greasy, backwoodsy kind of way. It had charm and character, but now the shack is gone and larry has gained about 25 pounds and they have two locations and there is exposed lighting and nice booths and T-shirts for sale. Hey, when the cash gods give you your chance to cash in, you might as well, but some places don't sell out and its too bad that this place has fancied itself up. The food though was pretty much what I remember, although Waffle House has better, crispier waffles. The chicken is still top quality, but not the \"best ever\" anymore, hey something has too suffer when your expanding. The home fries were outstanding with huge chunks of real potatoes and a healty dose of onions and two colors of peppers on top and the sweet tea was terrific in it's mason jar for 3 bucks. It's still clearly worthy of a visit by tourist and local, but if your in a real good fried chicken place in the South, you will wait 25 minutes for fresh chicken. My meal came out in ten minutes which leads me to believe things are a bit different in that kitchen these days than the good ole days gone past.",

I haven't been to KFC, Popeyes or Church's Chicken in years and my friend had been suggesting this place since I moved to Phoenix over 4 years ago. Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch. A lot of regulars come here and it's obvious from the waiters and waitresses hootin and hollering at the customers when they come in by their first names, kind of cool! Anyways, I will be back for more fried chicken for sure and am curious to try their cat fish!",

It's just that kind of place.  It's a must-do as food goes in Phoenix. It reminded me of the south.",

I get a sweet tea, and I mean sweet tea, in a mason jar. That part was cool, reminded me of the Chuck Box, so no biggie in that respect, plus you can really get a lot of liquid into one of those...and they are easy to wash and maintain. That much I know from restaurant operations.  The food was good and I certainly was full till dinner, late dinner at that. On my way in a group of folks was leaving, the little girl got a bit ahead of everyone ..and the mom shouted out her to \"stay with the family\".. it was a cultural thing for me.. reminded of days in Georgia and other places where emphasis is placed on the family.   Once inside I saw that same atmosphere, where it was definitely a family place, service was good, and the food came quick...and was yum. Maybe I just missed some good soul food. I wasn't brave enough for the greens and such..still had a great meal.   Did I mention that the food was awesome...",

First cup of grits had a tiny amount of butter and were way overdone, like they were scrapped out of the bottom of the pan.  When a second waitress saw what was in my bowl, and saw my dry ass overdone eggs (this was 5 minutes after they were brought out....I was still waiting for the chicken and waffles) she offered to bring new eggs and grits.  Second round, (still no chicken and waffles) eggs were much better but grits were underdone and watery.  When the chicken and waffles showed up, the waffles were already cool with no browning at all.  Coffee was terrible.  Wife's plate was just as bad.  Our original waitress never bothered to check on us until she brought the bill.  And to top it all off, the food is way overpriced, and over hyped!!! The one solid was the chicken.  It was lightly battered and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The scrambled eggs were real, not the fake crap.  I just wish someone in the back new how to cook them properly.  With the exception of the one waitress who replaced my first plate, it seemed like no one there, including the cooks, really gave a shit about the food or the service.  Very disappointing considering all the good reviews.",

Stupid fries came out first, it's interesting since it has gravy with it. Not bad - I like it.  Okay - so this is the millionare dollar question: How's the Lo-Lo?  I think it's just okay, I don't see what's so special about it. It's just a big piece of waffle, it's not especially crispy or anything. It's soft and soggy. If you like your waffles like that, then maybe it fits you better than for me. The fried chicken was definitely crispy so that's good. It wasn't flavorful though. It just tasted deep fried. I think KFC and Churchs chicken taste better. I rather buy KFC or Church chicken and make my own waffle with my waffle machine and eat it.   It's a little bit on the saltier end for the chicken but it didn't bother me too much.  The service here can be nice but when they are attentive, the wait staff is extremely courteous and kind! They let us move to a bigger table because we didn't have enough room on our small table for all our food.  Last point...if you've been to Roscoes, it reminds me of Roscoes but I think it MIGHT be cheaper than Roscoes.",

    "text": "My first time trying chicken and waffles, let's see what the hype is about. First of all my big mistake was going there on a Sunday, Palm Sunday to be exact. We were told there would be a 30 min wait, which I was surprised due to the amount of people that were already waiting. So we waited and waited and waited. Well 30 min wait turned into an hour wait.   We finally got a place to sit and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we got to put in our drink orders! The drinks came in big mason jars and I ended up ordering sweet tea ($3), which was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't really drink it.   My husband ordered KK which consisted of 3 piece chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs with cheese and onions. I ordered Baby Ray which came with 3 piece chicken with gravy and 2 waffles. We also ordered side of collard greens.  We then waited and waited and waited for our food which took about 50 mins! The waitress never once came over to see how we were doing or even informed us about our food. The kitchen looked like there was no sense of order and it was chaotic behind the counter.   So now on to the food. The chicken with gravy and the collards were the only things that were actually delicious. The waffles were soft and dense, it was more like a pancake shaped like waffles. The grits were cold and congealed, I'm assuming it would've been good if it was hot because the flavors were decent.   Basically we waited an hour for the table, hour for the food, and ate in 15 minutes. I'm not sure if I would return to give it another try but if I did, I would go on a weekday.",

Maybe that's their plan; get you drunk so you don't notice how long your food is taking. As far as the food, we shared a couple of plates of chicken and waffles, greens and  grits. Grits were bland. Greens were great.  Chicken and waffles were good. I'm from SoCal so I've had Roscoe's chicken and waffles.  They both tasted about the same.",

When we arrived there was about a 30 minute wait which is typical for a Saturday night. When we were seated it took about 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and ask for our beverages. After we ordered along with our beverages it took about another 10 minutes for us to receive those beverages. The wait time for our food was nearly 45 minutes and we had received it and we were missing condiments. Our waitress did not come and check on us until we were almost finished with the meal. I personally had the fish and chips with cod and I honestly it was one of the worst meals that I've had and I left the restaurant hungry. My husband had the boneless breast chicken and waffles meal which was ok. The waffle was really good but a few hours after we got home he was in the restroom throwing up. Based on this experience I will no longer go here again nor recommend it. For $40 you can definitely go somewhere else and get more value for your money.",

    "text": "My significant other and I came on a busy weekend around lunch time. There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water.   Once we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.  Chicken smothered in gravy and onions: Maybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken.   Waffle: The waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had.   Mac & cheese: This was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again.   Cornbread: Warm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken.   Red koolaid: This came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods.   Service: The complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant.   Overall, I would like to come back and eat here again, but not on an empty stomach if it's busy.",

But that expansion should have warned us enough to try somewhere else. While the atmosphere and decor was phenomenal and fun, the food was not. I am becoming a chicken and waffles connoisseur as I travel, and these chicken and waffles should have been passed up. The waffles were flat and soggy, the chicken seemed to be microwaved, and not enough syrup was provided. I hardly use syrup so for me to be left wanting more was surprising. I did enjoy the taste of the waffles...maybe a hint of cinnamon which is unusual but great, but neither my husband or myself finished our meals which is a big sign that something was sadly off.",

I have a toddler now and the long wait to get service, drinks, and our food was not sitting well with her or me. 40 min wait to get seated, 10 min for a waiter to appear, close to an hour for food and waiter to reappear.  I think if you're looking for a place to go hang with adults to catch up; the wait is worth the wait.   Dress code: ghetto to fab to ghetto fab is all gravy in here.",

Um, chicken & waffles are like my cryptonite so before I knew it I was sitting at the counter looking at an amazing red velvet cake under glass and a crazy menu with so many choices I thought I had died and gone to heaven!  Love the drinks served in mason jars.  Nice touch Lo-Lo's!   So I ordered chicken and waffles of course (duh!) and a side of collard greens.  The southern fried chicken was perfect!  Add to that an awesome waffle soaked in butter and maple syrup.  Is there anything better?  Well, yes there is because the collard greens had to be the best I have ever tasted.

WARNING:  IF YOU HAVE A LARGE PARTY, YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!",

We arrived on a Saturday night about 6 and to our surprise the place wasn't crowded..actually got a parking place right in front. When we walked in a woman yelled sit any where..then someone else yelled..y'all have to wait. so we waited..and waited. Mind you that several tables in plain view were available. After we were seated..without menus, we waited another 10 minutes before someone came back to the table with our menus..we didn't really need the menus for we have been to Lo-Lo's several times. Waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order..a Betty Boop, a Tre Tre, a plain waffle for the child, 1 sweet tea, 1 unsweeted tea, 1 red kool-aid. Took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  Again..not busy. The waitress brought out the Tre Tre and Betty Boop but not the waffle for our son..had to wait another 10 minutes to flag someone down to bring his waffle..long story short, the chicken and waffles were amazing as always, but the unsweeted tea was on the verge of souring..and the service was just plain awful. Lo-Lo's gets extremely buzy, especially on Sunday mornings and we have never had a problem, maybe it was an off night..but for the life of me I don't understand why it took us almost 2 hours for 3 pieces of fried chicken and 3 waffles.",

We ordered and upon waiting for our food my brother noticed a young man in the KITCHEN BLOWING HIS NOSE.   Unfortunately, he was the one that served us our food.  We addressed the issue with the manager and a few minutes later the young man that was seen blowing his nose aggressivley apporached our table to state that he understand that we filed a complaint against him.  Needless to say, this was very unprofessional and could have caused mayhem or altercation.  The manager or the worker appears to not understand the health concerns or dangers associated with the uncleanliness that situatuion posed.  We should not have had to address this or have the server approach us about our concerns.  QUITE UNPROFESSIONAL.",

Which is very concerning. I ordered their mojito and the mint was very old and turning black, there was also a bug in my drink. My service remade my drink but I just didn't feel comfortable drinking anything else. Then I order a side of waffles and there was a bug in my waffle. I'm worried what's going on in their kitchen, it has to be unsanitary for bugs to getting in the food. And why isn't anyone checking the food before it comes out? There wasn't many bugs flying around in the restaurant so it has to be the kitchen. Hopefully no one else experience this and need to clean up their kitchen and possibly hire an exterminator.",

The chicken and Mac and cheese are to die for, not to mention the kool-aid and lemonade! This location is further from my house than others so we will visit our closer location next time but I highly recommend this one if you're in the area. Can't beat the original location!!",

The price is reasonable and the chicken is really good. I have been to a lot of chicken and waffle places in my travels for work. The wait can be long for some because we are accustomed to having our orders in under 20 minutes when we go out.

    "text": "How do you squeeze in eating at three restaurants within a 12-hour time span?  Travel with me and my spouse!  I actually had Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe bookmarked for our last layover meal in Phoenix but because they didn't open early enough, we ended up at Lo Lo's.   ATMOSPHERE: Established in 2002 by Larry White, the restaurant is located in a quiet but shady-feeling part of southern Phoenix.  They proudly display their back-of-house operation with big windows along the sidewalk where you can see them making their biscuits.  The space has a fun vibe with soul music pumping throughout.  Brick walls and industrial decor made for a modern feel.  Seating is plentiful with a mix of booths, low tops and protected outdoor tables.  MENU: It's huge!  Southern-inspired breakfast selections, chicken & waffle combos, catfish, shrimp, grits, burgers, salads, desserts, kids menu.  FOOD: Lil Amadi - $8.00 This chicken & waffle combo came with a drumstick, a thigh and a waffle!  What a deal!?  The chicken was crispy, juicy and seasoned perfect.  I'm thinking they do a dry batter as there wasn't that nasty undercooked film you sometimes find in wet-battered fried chicken.  The waffle had a nice crunch and was moist inside but there was a hint of cinnamon coming from either the syrup or the waffle itself that I could've done without.  Still, I'd totally order this again.  Very tasty!  One Buttermilk Biscuit - $4.29 It was a hearty portion with great flavor and just the right amount of moistness.  Comes with a dollop of butter and jam to the side.  Cheese Grits - $4.29 Talk about butter and oil overload.  While it was tasty, there was way too much butter that crowned the bowl.  The copious amount of cheese also left a big oil slick at the top.  I understand that southern cuisine isn't healthy but they should be put on the side so one can regulate their cholesterol intake, LOL.  SERVICE: Amanda was our terrific, on-the-ball server.  She was friendly, professional and checked on us often.   TIP: The entire menu is available from breakfast time, which is how they earned our biz!  OVERALL: The best chicken and waffles I've had yet.  Lively ambiance, nice menu, great service.  A definite return!",

Do yourself a favor don't let the negative remarks discourage you. Go at a time that they are not busy. If you have a problem let them know so it can be addressed.",

Personally I'm not a huge fan of white meat because it tends to be dry but my friend recommended it. The waffle was amazing as it was crispy and fluffy. The chicken itself was good although next time I will order thighs or drums. The Bloody Mary was delicious and service was quick and friendly for how busy they were. I will come back to try more of their menu because of a lot of it looks absolutely delicious.",

    "text": "For a couple years I have wanted to visit Lo-Lo's but never did, so when I was asked what I wanted for a birthday meal I said there.  And I was so happy with my choice, too. I never had chicken with waffles before--and wondered why anyone would think of putting them together in the first place--but the food was delicious.  The waffles were really good with just the right amount of cinnamon in them.  Lots of butter (hello! calories), and just made right. Got the 3 piece chicken, 2 waffle combo for $16--and the waffles are so huge that I got thru about 3/4rs of them--and only one of the chicken thighs I ordered.   The chicken has to be deep fired.  I don't eat skin, but the chicken underneath is about as juicy as you will ever eat.  Just absolutely perfectly cooked. A side drink of lemonade was disappointing as it is made from a sugary powder, not that good, too sweet but they will give you refills if you want.  Not for me, but considering I saw tons of people drinking KoolAid means others like that sort of drink. The biggest disappointment was the appetizer of fried green tomatoes.  The tomatoes aren't green--and, yes, being a fried green tomato aficionado, I can tell they aren't by the taste.  They take yellow hybrid tomatoes and then fry them in a killer batter (just thick but wonderful--altho wayyyy too salty).  But for $8 you get only 5 pieces!!!  For that price, I thought I would get an entire basket of them. 5 is really way too chintzy, and I would never get them again.  I felt ripped-off here. It was a Sunday at around 1pm, and there was a 40 minute wait.  Alot stand outside, but we found a seat inside while waiting.  They do have a nifty system of getting people churned here, so this restaurant runs like a smoothly oiled machine really. Would I come back?  Are you kidding?  Heck, yes, but this time I am only getting the same chicken and waffles, will drink iced tea which I saw one person get and skip the fried green tomatoes altogether.  This place is a super winner. Service, by the way, was wonderful from the young lady we had!  Def no complaints there.",

Obviously, you cannot go wrong with their chicken and waffles but what I go there for is there breakfast!  You cannot go wrong with there Banana Caramel Sweet Hot Cakes, and their Chorizo & Eggs.  If you want the go to breakfast item at LoLo's you have to get the biscuits and gravy!  You get a big fluffy flaky biscuit with thick country sausage gravy!  Just how i like it!  Lolo's is amazing for soul food but be sure to try out their breakfast.  You will not be disappointed.  BrandonFitFoodie",

Our waitress was really friendly and kept checking on us even though they were super busy.  I had the LoLo's the 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was really crispy, not at all greasy and had perfect flavor, the waffles I really liked with the cinnamon inside kicked it up a notch on the flavoring which I really enjoyed.

My drumsticks lacked flavor, but there was crunch. Their award winning hot sauce to me was essentially Tabasco with spice to it. Not overwhelming but also not special enough to keep my satisfied. Kool aid is made well. My girlfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy. They did mess up my gf's eggs. Gave her scrambled instead of over medium, but that's ok they were still good. Her potatoes were salted appropriately to not taste too salty but just enough so that you still taste the potato. Only had a few bites of her biscuits and gravy and they were enjoyable. Overall the chicken is what is going to keep me from coming back, it was too plain, lacked seasoning and to me was essentially just fried.",

There was a lot of chatter and laughing in the dining area but how could that possibly be a bad thing? I'll definitely be back.",

The food is good and the Kool aide is amazing!! The only downfall is that they get very busy and don't handle the traffic very well.. the waiting staff could use some training on how to turn tables and get more customers and money through the doors. On occasion the chicken was pretty dry as well. Overall I like the place and will continue to stop in (off peak hours of course)..",

    "text": "So this location has many 4 and 5 star reviews and I am sure this location is usually worthy of those ratings. However, our visit was good but not the 5 star experience we had hoped for.  The decor and theme inside is catchy and looks like what you would expect a great chicken and waffle joint to look like. The mason jar glasses and chicken theme along with the specialty Kool-Aide flavors is neat. Everything was neat and clean inside and the staff was friendly and pleasant.   Long Wait and Slow Service  The wait on Sunday was 45 minutes for a table for two which is not that uncommon for a great food place on the weekend. However, it's still a 45 minute wait once we were seated we then figured out why the wait was so long. It was not the busy number of customers its the EXTREMELY slow service.  We placed an appetizer order and that took about 35 minutes for the catfish beignets. When they did arrive they were tasty and we enjoyed them. We placed our order not long after the app order and that took about another 45 minutes after the app. So all in all about an hour for our food to be delivered. We noticed many of the other tables were taking 45 min to an hour as well for their food.   When a kitchen is making food fresh I know it can take longer to get out to the customer and is well worth it usually. However, an hour to serve chicken and waffles even fresh is excessive. If the kitchen could expedite faster they could reduce the wait times and turn the tables more quickly improving the customer experience.   Food  We both ordered chicken and waffle dishes I added on scrambled eggs and my wife selected grits. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a nice crispy skin. The waffle was regular waffles you would get in a hotel thin, bland, and not crispy. The eggs I ordered they messed up the order and needed to replace them. I was impressed how quickly they took care of it and remade the eggs. The grits were cooked perfect and my wife enjoyed them with the cheese and butter.   Overall I can see the draw people have with the location. The owner has done a great job of branding the business, creating excitement inside with the decor, and his staff is friendly. The only downside is the long wait to get inside, long wait for the food, and mixed up order. The actual chicken and waffles were good and very similar to other places I have visited around the country.   They are worth visiting and it is a good experience. If you visit on a non-weekend it might less of a wait as well. I hope you have the 5 star experience we hoped to have and others here on yelp have experienced.",

The two of them together is fantastic. Their mac n cheese is very good. And you can't truly experience LoLo's without some Kool-Aid. You don't order it by flavor buy by the color. My favorite is Red.  This is one of our favorite places to eat. I was so happy to see that they opened up at Chase Field. We eat there every time we go to a D-Dacks game. I just wish the had Kool-Aid there.  If you have never had LoLo's Chicken and Waffles I suggest you try it. You won't regret it.",

My husband got the biscuits and said it was the best he ever had, as they do make them fresh! Collard greens were tasty and the fried green tomatoes weren't bad! Loved the batter.

    "text": "As a NC girl, I know my soul food...and this visit, sorry to say, was a big disappointment. Leading off with the positive: no better sweet tea anywhere in AZ & the fried chicken is a stand alone success with no sides needed. I tried the mac-n-cheese (served lukewarm and gummy, not freshly made). Hold times for these items short bc pasta sitting too long changes texture and sauce dries up and that's how my mac-n-cheese was, a wanna be. At $4 for small side dish, I had to send it back and tried the potato salad instead, which was fresh & tasty. The waffle also had to be sent back (served raw, wet--not cooked thru at all & no crunchy exterior. It was gummy, doughy & soft, batter too heavy, thick to cook thru properly). This may be due to kitchen staff not up to task or cost saving measure to cut wasted food, either way is an equally bad move. My server, Sir, was attentive, accommodating and made my meal a pleasure, what remained edible that is. One other notable issue: 5 staff stood gathered around hostess stand chatting and were totally oblivious to my repeated calls for assistance bc my server was busy with other tables--3xs I said \"excuse me ladies\" without one hearing me. Being that my booth was right next to the hostess stand, I found that unacceptable. It was about 3pm, so not super busy yet and they were enjoying a little down time, I get it, but not at customer's expense. Not one of the 5 staff heard me and I  called out to them 3 different times. Clean restaurant, great service but food not up to par with previous visits. If you don't know about it, you can't do better, so this is that. Sorry, will do another review in a few weeks and see what has changed or not. Shared all concerns with Miles, manager on duty, prior to this review posting. Grace to you & staff for another shot at a stellar review.",

    "text": "It was our first time here and everything was going smooth. We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait.   When we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.  He came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \"So what did you guys want to drink, again?\" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying.   Our order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \"who had this or that\" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones.   After a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.  After he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.  When it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.  So we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to.   As for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service.   I guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had...",

    "text": "I wish Yelp had a \"6th\" Star to award restaurants sometimes! I would give one to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles.... based on my dinner this past Friday night.  First off, we ended up here almost by accident. I made the drive with my wife and daughter on Friday evening from Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix to visit Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe.... only to learn they are now closing at 7PM every night! :(   They used to be open till 3am on Friday and Saturday nights.  But... they did inform us that Lo-Lo's was open and it was not too far away... so off we went.   They place was busy... and they sat us towards the back. But the service was crazy good!!!   You really need to spend a few good minutes acquainting yourself with the menu. I was laughing my ass off at the menu items! \"Stupid Fries\", \"Phat Azz Samich\", \"Crazy Ghetto Mess\", \"A Jar Of Drank\"! Just to name a few.  The best \"line\" of the night... my wife asks our waiter, \"How are the 'stupid fried'?\" His reply.... They're Stupid...............(long pause)..... GOOD!\"   I stuck with the tried and True chicken and waffles. We shared at the table the candied yams, and the fried okra. Everything was amazing! It was my first time having chicken and waffles together. And it won't be my last. I ate so much I was sick for several hours afterwards, but you can't help yourself!   Dinner on average seems to run about $13 a person.  So when you a re in the \"hood\", give Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles... you will be glad that you did!",

The Chilli cheese fires were absolutely delicious it was suppose to be an appetizer but i made them my course meal.  Visit 2: I came on a Wednesday 2pm. It was perfect!! No line and waiter was on top of her game.   For my drink or as the menu labels them \"dranks\": Bloody Bacon Mary- i'm always looking to try something different. Bacon in my vodka cocktail isn't something everyone serves so i figured give it a shot. I wont order this item again but then again I don't like v8. Mojitos are good. The balance of mint to sweetness was ride up my alley. I prefer a bit most alcohol punch but I can't complain this isn't a bar.   Too my surprise they have BEER ON TAP. I stuck to Goose Island IPA this stuff is so good. Bourbon pigment, hoppy/malt flavor a little low in alcohol (below 6% abv) but perfect for lunch time.   Appetizers:  Catfish Beignets they were white and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside their dipping sauce complimented the dish exceptionally good. The fried mushrooms and zucchini don't compare to the catfish. Lunch: Chicken/Waffles its their specialty so they really can't screw this up. Good chicken and good waffles.  In closing statement Would I come back...Yes.  Is it worth waiting an hour wait....Nope not in my opinion. I'll come back during not so busy hours.",

I was in Phoenix for the weekend so my cousins took me to Lo Lo's for some chicken and waffles for an early dinner on Sunday.  The place was packed and very busy so I knew it had to be something special about the food.  After waiting about 20 minutes to be seated I ordered the $14 special with 3 pieces of chicken a side red beans, and rice and gravy.  I also ordered what I think was a blue berry lemonade....lets just say it was a blue drink :).  It was in a huge glass mason jar and was super sweet.  I liked it but I had to add a couple slices of lemon to tarten it up and some water to smooth out all that sugar.  The food was hot and fresh and tasted great.  Over all the place was nice and clean and the decor was nice.  The waiters although super busy was nice and efficient.  When I visit Phoenix I will definitely revisit Lo Lo's....I have to get some of the catfish that my cousin had on her plate that I kept pinching off of lol.  Lo lo's closes early on Sunday so get there by 3:30 because you can't get in after 3:59 on Sundays.",

To make it worse my girlfriends food came first and I had to wait another 7 minutes for mine. We had also ordered chili fries that came out 10 minutes after I received my food! The chili was terrible and her side of string beans and red potatoes was straight out of the can . However the chicken was great. Otherwise it was a terrible experience.

We spend $11 on dessert to go (red velvet & banana pudding), both were extremely dry. The pictures totally gave us False hope. I seriously think the desserts were a week old at least.   4. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing special.   I would return but it's not a place I would go out of my way for.  P.s ~ be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for a table on a sunday afternoon.",

    "text": "The experience was so horrible I don't really know where to begin.   1st we went here this past weekend during bike week. My group was ready to go and check it out based on all the \"hype\" around this place. I don't hold the wait time to be seated against them. It was actually good based on how crowded they were with visitors. It only took them about 30 min to seat us. One good thing they do is text your phone when your table is ready. I thought that was a good idea.   The overall atmosphere is good. Nice music playing, lighting etc. A really good atmosphere. I think this place might be great if you were going for drinks only. Good menu selection, good prices etc. So now I got you wondering why the one star review.   It only took about 30 min to seat us but it took over 1 1/2 hour to get our food from the time we ordered. The server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait. He comes out and said sorry for the wait but we are busier than usual and I guess it has to do with \"bike week\", then he says your order is up next there is only two orders ahead of you now. Let me think about the definition of the term \"next\"...hmmm \"your order is up next, there are only two orders ahead of you\" well.....let's continue. A while later our food comes out and it was horrible. Let me repeat that horrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is supposed to come with biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon. What I got was biscuits and gravy, potatoes and my bacon. No eggs which I ordered over medium. The gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold. Not luke warm but cold. I told the server my eggs are not with my meal and he said they would be right out. This was no kidding 15 min later and they he brings them to me and says sorry but do you still want them. Are you kidding me? What type of service is this? The manager/owner whatever is not doing his/her job. This is not good ole southern food. I am from TX and you must be saying it is good ole Southern part of AZ food or something.   I will not go to this place ever again. I visit AZ for business often and I am a creature of habit. They could have made a fan of me but blew it. I normally will give a place at least two visits before I give a review but the service is awful, the food was awful and the management was not prepared for a big crowd. The feedback I got from my friends is there food was cold, grits were watery, chicken was decent, atmosphere was great and service was horrible.   Maybe this place is better when they are not busy with all the bikers but I will not go back for several reasons and will not recommend them to a homeless hungry person.",

The waffles were nothing special at all and a bit under cooked in my book. The eggs were just eggs and the grits were soaked in butter and flavorless. If I am going for a hear attack at least I want to enjoy the taste, or get good value.   My co workers also got a jar of kool-aid, this a diabedic shock inducing concoction that is so sweet it is viscous $2.50 with refills.   I say go to say you tried it and that is about it.",

    "text": "Man, what can I say? My family and I really really enjoy going to Lolo's, but yesterday's experience was awful. And it was meant to be a celebration for my wife and I because of our new baby and we just got out of the first ultrasound. There were hardly any people there and it was like 3pm & service was extremely fast, but then it went downhill from there. There was this really skinny server girl that dropped a fork, then went to get it, but dropped another fork, then when she went to get that, another one dropped. I felt bad but then she said, \"If I drop another goddamn fork!\" I understand her frustration, but being a follower of God, that was a bummer to hear. The same girl went to grab a plate from my table and dropped it, which is an accident so I wasn't trippin, but she grabbed plate and didn't even clean up the food that fell off of it. Our server was a very cool dude, but felt like he was rushing us out. He came with food quick, but also came with the bill quick and didn't offer refills on drinks or dessert. When I asked him if I could get a refill, he said he'd put it in a go cup, but we never said we were going. Then that same skinny girl started yelling right next to my table at another Mexican girl server across the room about $2 that she owed her. It was a friendly yell between two friends, but it was ghetto as heck. I wanted to be like, girl, you are at work, be professional. Then lastly, my meal cost roughly $36 and I gave $40. The receipt said $3.36, but he gave me an even $4 in change, which is stealing from the owner and the main reason I'm writing this. I'm not sure if it was laziness or he thought he was doing me a favor, but it wasn't cool at all. Lolo's always felt like a fantastic place to eat with friendly servers. It's not a suit and tie place, but the service was professional. Yesterday felt like I was at the waffle house because of employee behavior. We will for sure go again, but I'm praying the employees step their game up otherwise Lolo's will probably lose some customers",

HOWEVER it took at least 20 minutes to get our drinks, and the server did not bring us the waters we ordered at the same time. We had to flag down another server to get water. Our entrees took over an hour to come out. Literally every other table in the room was served before our dinner came out, including an 8 top that was seating 30 minutes after we ordered. And when our food finally came the server brought it to the wrong table and only brought one entree.  At this point we were starving and pissed, so we left. We spoke to the manager and explained we just wanted to pay for our drinks and appetizers. She charged us full price for both. I wasn't looking to get anything comped, but she offered no apology or explanation.  I was pissed and horribly disappointed at the lack of customer service and will never give this place another chance.",

Then when we were done we sat there waiting for her to come back around to get our tab. Waited even longer for her to come back to allow us to pay- thank goodness we were paying with cash. We just left it on the table. My guy and I were joking that this would be a perfect dine and dash spot because the staff is too busy socializing with one another to realize if someone slips out.",

I have to say although it was abusive on our part, I loved that accessibility.  It gave the place a down-home family feel! I also loved the mason jar motif, especially for the kool-aid (haven't had that since I was a child)!  I didn't eat much because I wasn't that hungry, but I did get a waffle that was delish! Since I'm a veggie, the menu was kinda limited for me, so I kept asking \"can you add something to the waffle?\"  The waiter suggested pecans.  OMG! it was SO good.  My friends enjoyed their chicken and waffles.  My friend's mom didn't care for the grits, but we all loved her banana pudding.  It was the standout dish - well done.",

Today however they have started to appeal to the more yuppy carb friendly crowd so the food has become incredibly bland and tasteless. It's gone from a True soul food restaurant that made you feel like you were at home with Grandma to a place a tourist would go for a \"soul food experience\". It really saddens me but I can't recommend this place to anyone looking for actual good soul food. I loved this spot but I will not be returning.",

The chicken is perfectly fried, very crispy and has great seasoning. I feel like they put some type of spice or cinnamon in their waffles that makes them so addicting. But not only that, the regular entrees are tasty too. Get ready for a sugar coma on the sweet tea, lemonade, or Kool-Aid. Only downside is service is a little slow. This place is amazing!",

We ordered the fried okra, and two plates of chicken and waffles. I really liked their hot sauce, it was nice and tangy. Their waffles were also really great! They had a good amount of spice and were thinner than typical Belgium waffles that most people are used too. Chicken was very good, I prefer mine to have a little less breading but it was very fresh and hot. Their hot chocolate was awesome and the kool aid is a cute touch. Overall this was a great stop and I am looking forward to going back!",

I can go and have a good meal one day, return a week later and order the same thing and it is inedible. On my last visit the chicken legs were the size of turkey legs but they were flavorless. Either the waffles are perfect or someone get's heavy handed on the cinnamon and nutmeg and it's gross. French roast burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, mac-n-cheese is fine one day and a week later it takes like it was made with government cheese. They need a whole meeting of the minds for the cooks. Someone needs to be running the line and checking quality before it gets to the table to maintain consistency at both locations.",

We got there about 1:00 so after the big lunch crowd and even though the parking lot was full we were seated right away.  The restaurant is bigger than it looks and has outside seating. (Also an overflow parking lot we discovered driving away)    We were greeted right away and our waitress took our drink orders.  There is so many great things on the menu we kept having to tell her we needed more time.  We decided on Chicken tenders and a waffle and catfish and grits.  We also ordered cornbread because someone had mentioned the great cornbread on a review I read.   Our lunches came out in a timely fashion delivered by a different girl but not at the same time which we thought was a little strange.  When she brought the second lunch out she said she would bring back the cornbread.  The chicken and waffle was great,  the waffle was good a little cake like but we liked it.   The catfish was like I remembered my grandmother making from fish we caught at the farm.  The grits were served with a big scoop of butter, very yummy.  The cornbread never arrived and we had to flag down our waitress and ask for it.  This is why I don't like when your waitress doesn't bring your food to you.  We used it as a dessert.  It was very good, a little sweet, and had actual corn in it.  There were several things on the menu that I would like to come back and try so we will be back.  The staff was really friendly and everyone we walked by going out thanked us for coming.  How often does that happen???",

All the sides were heavenly but the dirty rice in particular.. AMAZING. I wish I had ordered a large bowl of just the dirty rice!  It also adds a lot more fun to the ambiance with the kool aid mix served in Mason jars. You can mix and match whichever soft drinks you prefer! You'll see other tables all leaving with a to-go cup of whatever concoction they were drinking - free!  The restaurant seems to be constantly busy, but our servers were super helpful, kind, and patient with us. They use the Yelp wait-list though so make sure to take advantage of that.",

The waffle was one of the best I've had. The Mac tastes good but would have been better if it was served hotter. 4 stars because it was after 20 minutes I had to ask someone who our server was and to send them over because no one has come to assist us.",

The chicken is always crispy and fresh and you to make it even better you should throw on some hot sauce, It's delicious. Love the cinnamon flavored waffles to pair with my chicken (Lil Amadi). & the mac n cheese is grade A. Only downside is the price for a side of mac n cheese is pretty steep at $5.   Pro tip: order an extra glass of water with your kool aid lol.",

She got manager to come out to tell us that chicken tenders are taking sooo long to cook.  That's the reason why our food was not coming out.  We came into restaurant at 3:30 , was seated at 3:50,  ordered our food by 4:05 ... Time is now 4:43 food arrived.  All I can say is food was worth the wait.  Food was excellent!  Although I don't recommend getting seated outside, there are homeless people who come around to ask for food , money , and were rude.  Besides the wait and sitting outdoors , food was excellent!",

    "text": "Having recently moved to Phoenix, this is my favorite place to eat out here so far. The area looks a little sketchy, but maybe only because I've always gone after it's already dark out. I've been here three or four times and they have never disappointed! Someone has been outside the door greeting every time I have visited. Even when we had to wait to be seated, we were given menus to look over while we waited. They are always busy and with good reason!  My family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.  We ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous.   We all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty.   The prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees. I will definitely be returning!",

And just bask in the culinary amazing-ness that is fried chicken and waffles. That's right, I just said bask in reference to breakfast foods.   Lo-Lo's is no ordinary breakfast fare; it can be enjoyed any time of the day. I prefer it after a few stiff drinks, when my cravings become insatiable. But let's get down to business:  Get the \"red\" kool-aid to drink. It's a little sweet, and I usually water mine down a bit. It's much better than the lemonade which is really tart.   I like the Tre-Tre for my main entree because it comes with two legs that are good to da bone and very easy to manage.   For sides, because I am like a ravenous animal at Lo-Lo's, I get the mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese is out of control delicious. It has baked cheese on top, and it is super creamy underneath the hard shell. I feel like a barnyard pimp when I eat the cornbread because of the large portion. It is very moist as well (I usually put a little syrup from the waffles on it.).   You don't have to be hood rich to eat at Lo-Lo's either. Everything is more than reasonably priced. All in all, I love dis place!!",

    "text": "Fried Chicken, Mac and Cheese, Red Velvet Cake and Kool-Aid! Now that's my kind of breakfast.   Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!   My fiance and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiance and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.   The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.   If you like Soul Food and happen to be in the Phoenix area then you have to check out Lolo's. This place rocks!",

We've heard rave reviews about this place so maybe that's the norm?   Anyway. We went for my birthday breakfast around 11 and ordered Betty's Boob and Malaysia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger to kind of get a broader taste of the food. It was good, great even, but not perfect. For one, the chicken was a little dry and slightly chewy. Still edible and the seasoning was superb, but I wish the piece had been nice and juicy on the inside. The waffle was delicious. Wanted a little cruch on the outside there, but have no complaints about the taste at all. Together the chicken and waffles we very good. Then there was the burger which, same as the chicken and waffles, was very good all together, but the patty was more well than I ordered and needed some more seasoning. It was however a decently thick patty,  juicy and cheezy as the name states with lots of veggies and a tasty bun.   Would return again, but like I said, at a hopefully less busy day/time. And wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. :)",

When I saw LoLos I was so excited and couldn't wait to get a piece of home and a good meal. It didn't work out that way. The service was mediocre at best, host was rude and didn't take our names down for a table while we waited. The food was ridiculously priced for what is was....$5 for a tiny side of collards, are you out your mind???? A bushel big enough to feed a full grown family just dinner on collards is $5, get real. To my surprise, they also didn't have apple cider vinegar, or even white vinegar to go with it, I had to ask several times if the cook would possibly share some of his. My server was young, so I'll give him some credit for being inexperienced but he was terrible at serving (maybe he was new?), that being said, he was very kind and I appreciate that. The food didn't come out together, wasn't what we ordered and took forever just to get it. Do you literally go out back and grab a chicken and go from there? If so, it's at least from scratch. The food was mediocre as well. I was really wanting it to be great food even if not a great atmosphere/service... but the food was by no means soul food or remotely a southern cooked meal. I was disappointed and won't be going back, which is a shame because I live downtown AND I love to eat out. If anyone has a recommendation where to try, please let me know!",

Our server was Steven and he had the most perfect voice! We got our drinks and I had to try the sweet tea. If you're a fan of southern sweet tea, then you will NOT be disappointed. I felt like I was in Georgia when I took that first sip. And they serve drinks in a giant Mason jar!  We started off with their Stupid Fries and that was super delicious. I had their soul food platter where you can make your own plate. I had the 3 piece chicken with Mac and cheese and potato salad with a corn bread. It came to us hot and quick. The chicken was so flavorful and easy to get off the bone. Wasn't too impressed with the potato salad but omigosh the cornbread!   Service was pretty good. The waiter took a while to come back to refill drinks. But other than that, I highly recommend coming here. Great for a casual date night, family night, or having a meal with some good friends. Can't go wrong with some good fried chicken and a big Mason jar of sweet tea!",

This was my first time at the Phoenix location. I have been to the Scottsdale location a few time. I don't know which one I like better. They are both great. The Phoenix one does have a very nice outdoor seating are. They have a big green outdoor couch that is very comfy. Great to hang out on while you wait for your table. I was there for the 4th meeting of the UYE Breakfast Club. Always a good time with great people. I know they have other things on the menu but how do you get by the chicken and waffles. One day I might have to go twice in one day so I can try something else. I ordered the 2 drumsticks and a waffle. #10. It was awesome of course. Don't forget the jar of Kool Aid. Yum. So good. Great service too. Everyone is always really nice. This is the place where I first tried grits. I have heard people complain about grits in general but these were great. Add a little honey and they are almost perfect. Maybe some cinnamon would put them over the top. This one of those places where the food is so good you can't stop eating even though you are full. The place was very clean and the pictures on the wall are great. This is one of my favorite places and I will be back to this location or the Scottsdale one over and over again.",

The chicken, no longer has \"ANY\" flavor.  The Service,  just isn't the same.  And the Owner, doesn't appear to give a Shit anymore.  Hey, We the people used to just Rave about LoLo's.  However lately..... going to have to find another place.  The Cental Location.... Im DONE with.  However, I did go the the new Scottsdale location.. The service was alittle better.  However, the Food.... was just BLAND..... Come On.....Get back to, Why your customers, came to you in the first place......The FOOD.... !!! If the food is no longer any good.   Why waste my time WAITING.... and WAITING.... and WAITING.... for Cold, Unseasoned, Blah Food?  Will not be going back..... Ive downgraded, Lo Lo's from 5 star to One Star, until I see improvement.  Will NOT be going back, and have let ALL my people Know as well.  We've  ALL had the same, experience lately.... ijs......",

The sweet tea was delish...def no splenda in there but reminded me of my grandma's tea growing up!  Our food came out piping hot and was YUM!  Ok, so chicken and waffles isn't the most extravagant cuisine for a 4-star review but Lolo's won me over with their service.  The food beat Roscoe's in LA and fancy schmancy steak houses could learn a thing or two from their customer service.  It was the perfect experience for what the restaurant is going for!",

The three women I ate there with loved it though but they all were very used to this type of food having gone there weekly for some time.

I asked what she recommended for a drink and she replied anything. Now I would have offered the most expensive drink they had. I was open for it. So I just ordered kool-aid. Which was the bomb. I once again asked what she suggested as far as the food goes. Once again anything was her reply. I don't even remember what I ordered but it was big portions. I eat a lot so I knew it was gonna take some effort. As soon as my food arrived not even five minutes later she was asking if I needed a check and a box. In my mind I was thinking I just got started. Now I was stuffed. I ate everything. Still had room for desert. But she didn't even offer so I was like well I better find another place to get some dessert. Even though I got crappy service I still tipped her 20% because I understand it's tough work. I look forward to going back and requesting Sharay again because everybody deserves a second chance.",

The food servers were quick and to the point, no wasting time kind of service. I was in a party of 20 and our food orders came out within a few minutes and they are generous with their portions. I personally ordered the \"Tre-Tre\" (2 drumsticks and 1 waffle) and added a side order of 2 eggs scrambled and a side order of corn bread. The menu prices are inexpensive too! Major Plus! Just be sure to bring cash if you are in a large party because they will only be able to split the bill into 2 seperate checks.",

Seriously, i dont even like fried chicken and there's is AMAZING ! Not greasy, the outside is delicious, tender inside, juicy and the waffles are simply perfect.  Threw down some cheesy grits, too. I have wanted to order other things off the menu, but the chicken and waffles is so good, i cant deviate from it.  Plus, they are super efficient and organized.Service is very, very good.  It will be busy when you go, so expect a wait.  But they move people in and out effectively and the place is immaculate.  Probably one of the cleanest restaurants ever.",

As soon as I arrived after circling the block looking for a place to park, I was greeted by a redicoulos wait in line, outside in the Arizona Blazing sun. Did I mention there is no shade and it\"s HOT outside. As soon as you get inside and sit down, you'll realize it\"s even hotter inside, then add in the humidity from everyone sweating cause it\"s so crowded in there. Nothing like sweating your butt off as you eat your food! As for the food, it was good. Fried chicken was fantastic and the Macaroni and cheese is splendid! Unfortunetly I wasn't impressed with the waffles :( they wernt bad but not good either. My suggestion would be to visit this establishment during arizonas cooler months Nov-April unless you like sweat with your food.",

As with every other time I'd been here, they did not disappoint.  The chicken was on point, crispy and well seasoned, the mac and cheese was oooey gooey cheesy goodness, and the waffle was oh so scrumptious!!!  They're light and fluffy, they have a hint of cinnamon, the butter they put on top is also fluffy, and the syrup is served hot.  It's orgasmic!!!

I got the sense that this was a destination for a post church dinner, not unlike the buffets in North Carolina that I went to. Got the KK's (3 pieces of white meat fried chicken, waffles, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions, and grits) which was way more than I could finish, but I wanted to try everything. Chicken was very good, fresh and not too greasy. The freshly made waffles were yummy with nice rich taste (buttermilk?). I really liked the eggs with cheese and onions (the onions were a great touch!). Grits, well, being a yankee, I've never quite understood their attraction. The sweet ice tea was, well, a bit too sweet and I had to stop drinking it. The red velvet cake was unusual. Not sure what give it its interesting taste (did they use beets to color the cake?).   All in all a satisfying, if not gluttonous meal.",

    "text": "Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is not my favorite dining establishment.  Publicly, that title is held by a recently-revived casual lunch and dinner spot in Tempe some miles away.  Its fresh, clean, simple dining and college casual environment appeal to the middle class pseudo-foodie in me, and it is to that restaurant that I introduce friends and acquaintances when they ask 'Where should we go for lunch?'  That restaurant is my public gastronomic facade, the place I almost dress up for, and where I know I will always end up, not because I am in love with it and cannot see it for its faults, but because I love it and incapable of comprehending a gustationary existence without it, my culinary spouse, if you will.  Lo-Lo's, however, is my lover.  Lo-Lo's, unlike the sleek, sophisticated, cosmopolitan Other, is the rich and rusticated temptress, a shadowy figure leaning suggestively upon a voluptuous Victorian balcony, or, in this case, against the brown stucco'd brick walls found between 1st and Central Avenues on Yuma Street.  The sharp, gentrificated Other demands poise, an appreciation for the obtuse nomenclature of Mediterranean flavors, and the quiet False dignity of petite bourgeois living: not unlike the maintenance costs of a promised cohabitant.  The artificial, hip vestments, gym membership, etc. all satisfy these demands.  Lo-Lo's, however, accepts me in the moonlight, when I am most exhausted by the petty realities of life, with my most basic of culinary judgments, paunch belly, and dimpled thighs, several of which were caused, in part, by my indulging in Lo-Lo's itself.  The chicken is succulent, always crispy on the outside, and never excessively greasy (if your definition of 'excessive' is based on a reasonable understanding of the genre of food that is served at Lo-Lo's).  The waffles are crispy and delicious, savory rather than sweet, and always served with copious amounts of sweet cream butter and syrup, so that even the most grossly over-indulgent might be satisfied.  The catfish is crusted with a simple cornmeal batter, perfectly seasoned, and juicy on the inside.  It's absolutely delicious with a light (or generous) coating of Louisiana hot sauce.  The majority of the sides are also delectable: the corn bread is served sweet-style, though not overly so.  The fried okra is plump and crispy.  The mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the candy sweets (sweet potatoes) both uncomplicated and complex.  The beans and rice are a meal unto themselves.  The drinks are very sugary, and unless you want to fill up on several hundred calories worth of sweet tea or (virtually opaque) Kool-aid on its own, it might be best to order water.  The lemonade is several rungs below both of those options on the sugary-ness level.  The atmosphere is casual, though not \"kick off your shoes\", casual; some of the staff live in the neighborhood, and they're very friendly and patient with customers.  Lo-Lo himself is often there on Sunday mornings, when the church crowds come to partake in his creations wearing their congregational best.  A Bose stereo in one corner of the smallish hallway/first dining room area often plays Jazz music.  It can get very crowded at virtually all hours, as it is a very popular place.  Plan on pooling your money: they discourage separate checks.  The bathroom is small but very clean and homey.  My lover, however, unlike those mythological places found only in culinary rags and the imaginations of tunnel-visioned food writers, is not perfect.  There is, to a degree, a problem of consistency at Lo-Lo's: those ordering their fried chicken with gravy may sometimes find their meal slathered in a salty, caramel-colored sauce popping with the flavor of roast onions.  Other times one is confronted with a considerably thinner gravy of nearly-raw white rings.  The cornbread, while always delicious, is sometimes dry.  The staff, friendly and generally attentive they may be, is often swamped by the sheer volume of people coming in and out of the dining areas, and it is often difficult to secure seating for large groups.  Don't be afraid to ask for refills on your drinks if necessary.  For all its faults, I find myself unable to draw myself away from Lo-Lo's for any more than a few weeks at a time, like some strange, wonderful addiction that from time to time demands my submission, a temporal span which, I suspect, will rapidly shorten as I surrender more and more often to the need.  My friends and I even crafted a clever neologism to describe the unique sensation of simultaneous joy, victory, disgust and regret that follows most outings to this alluring outpost of gustational heaven and nutritional hell: to get Lo-Lo'd.  In any case, assuming a readiness for all its faults and its aftereffects, I would recommend Lo-Lo's to anyone not currently pregnant, elderly, a child, or stricken with some sort of malady affecting nutritional well-being.",

Though most people go for the chicken and waffles, I much more prefer their smothered chicken with hash browns, collared greens, and sweet yams.  Be forewarned -- the smothered chicken is salty.  Much saltier than most people would prefer, tbh, at least if their palate is fairly \"white\" (as in not eating a lot of spices and salt and whatnot).  The sweet tea is always phenomenal and the red velvet cake is comparable to stuff I've eaten back East (i.e. it's fantastic).  For first timers, you will probably get \"the itis\" after eating here: make sure you have someone else with you who can handle the insulin overload and can drive you home.  I had taken an ex here after showing her The Boondocks episode about the itis (I know, I know) and she thought it was a myth until she started nodding off in the restautant itself.  You eat here and you don't need to eat for the rest of the day.",

This was so unprofessional . I've never had this happen NEVER will I ever come back to LoLos or allow anyone I know to support them.

    "text": "I've been to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles, where it's the talk of the town for being the best in its speciality. For you locals that wish you could try it...  ...go to Lolo's instead.   This isn't hometown bias, either! Hands down, I prefer Lolo's. The chicken is cooked to crispy perfection and the waffles are fluffy yet flat and soft yet crunchy, all with a slight hint of cinnamon. I never go here without ordering a huge mason jar full of Kool-Aid. The sense of family in this newly-renovated building is great; I always feel right at home. Their Mac-n-cheese is great, too! Sometimes you can catch them making their food in the front window where they have all their ingredients and kitchen tools out for display.   I promise you won't be disappointed. You'll leave with a super full stomach and a smile on your face.",

I'm okay with the sticky menus, the soggy mac and cheese can be overlooked as well, but don't disrespect me or make us wait 30 minutes for a plate of chicken.    If you're not in a hurry, you will probably love this place, but be prepared for some southern style mosy-like service.    Here are some tips worth the read:  the chicken is great, but if you really want to taste some soul food, you've got to get the dark meat and collard greens with waffles.  When you order your drink, you've got to try the Kool-aid.  Yes, I'm serious!  Lo-Lo's you've got me all worked up again.  If you could just have some friendly, fast service, I'd be regular and you'd be a bit richer.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Lo-Lo's. It's been on my AZ bucket list for 2 years. To say I was excited would be an understatement. I was dancing in anticipation. It wasn't very busy which seemed like a plus. We were seated immediately. Seemed like another plus. We waited about 50 minutes for our food- soul crushing. As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said/ about the wait/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out.   The  foodie in me and die hard downtownian is deeply disappointed and will likely never go back or recommend.   I gave it two stars because the chicken and waffles were alright.. the restaurant was clean. I got a refill on my coffee in my cute ass Lolo's mug from someone who was not my rude waitress.. although since I'm here writing this I might as well say that the mug had a large chip on the rim some could say is a liability. The hot sauce was good. I am a big hot sauce girl. My water came with a lemon which could be consTrued as classy and didn't taste like gross AZ tap and one waitress had cute hair and smiled at me..so that was nice.",

    "text": "Based on the positive Yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try and were really disappointed.  First, I let my wife out on the curb to inquire how long the wait was, we were told 20 minutes so I found a place to park across the street and decided to wait the 20 minutes since we had came all the way from Goodyear. Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said \"you're next\" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.  That was strike one.  Next, with the name \"Chicken and Waffles\" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.  The chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.  We were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left. Not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here. Our waitress gave us our drinks and took our order and we never seen her again until she brought me the check as a runner brought the food from the kitchen.",

I wish the waffles were crispier but now I'm just being picky.  The chicken was decent but seriously nothing compare to Roscoes so that's my mistake for thinking anything could.

One thing that would have made this experience extra ordinary is if they had a bartender or a server working the people waiting outside. We could have got a jar of DRANK before we actually walked in and sat down and our appetites would have REALLY been right.  I ordered the fried chicken, fries, and mac and cheese. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of food. You can tell they serve hundreds of people on a daily basis and their level of consistency of their food was exceptional.  Moreover, our server, I believe his name was Aaron (I apologize if I am incorrect) service was the cream of the crop. He took care of our table, he was fun, he was exciting, he joked with us, all things that make the experience that much better.  I will be back in Phoenix within the next month, you better believe that I will be here as soon as I land! Its not that far from the airport, I am sure I will be able to smell the aroma of the fried chicken as soon as I land.  Damn son, you all need to get a location in Denver, PHO REAL!",

My husband and I take most of our out-of-state guest to Lolo's for the experience; friendly staff, Kool- aid served in mason jars, beers in brown bags and the food of course! There is ALWAYS a wait of at least 30 mins, which we don't mind, it's worth the wait. Well today we had the WORST experience ever. We walked out! First an hour wait, okay Sunday afternoon understandable. Finally we were seated, only to wait some more;10 minutes and no server has come to take our drink order or even say \"I'm you're server and I'll be back for your drink order.\" I asked the hostess Destiny for a manager. Destiny was gracious enough to take our drink order and finally someone comes to check on us and take our order. We asked for China hot wings, the phat azz samich, 2 chicken tender baskets with a waffle and the steak and eggs.  5 mins later our wings come out. 20 mins later and still no food and people who were seated like 20 mins after us are getting their food. WTF! At this point my husband is pissed he got up talked to our server came back to the table left 20$ and we left.  We have NEVER, even during busier hours, have had such bad service at Lolo's. If the kitchen is slow and behind the server could have let us know come by the table and offer refills. Nope we didn't even get that. The server even followed us outside because we were short (I ordered a mimosa) the audacity! Anyway it's gonna be a long long while before we go back to Lolo's. What upsets me the most is toddler didn't get her waffle and she LOVES their waffles. They could've at least brought my daughters food out. Ugh!",

    "text": "So like many waffle and chicken places, you know what you are getting.. waffles and chicken! But there were some really good food options here! I got the 3 piece chicken and waffles, a side order of greens and Mac and cheese. I know, kind of greedy, but every time I saw someone else's order come out I was tempted to try what they had! I am a soul food lover so I was pleased. The chicken was nice and crispy with just enough seasoning. The greens were turnip/ collard with spices (really good and tender) and the Mac and cheese was nice and cheesy! I paired it with a sweet tea! The waffle was delicious. It was great with butter and syrup of course! The establishment was clean and we went on a comedy night. The comedy wasn't great but that's not the restaurant fault, just bad comedians. My total came out to about 20 bucks for everything I ordered. The waffle and chicken alone was around 13.00 Try them out, you won't regret it.",

As I walked in, it was pretty crowded and everyone looked like they were having a great time! The lady greeted my girlfriend and I and told us the wait was around 10 minutes. So roughly around 23 minutes later we were finally seated. ( I was totally fine waiting the extra minutes and was in no rush).   We sat there for about another 15 minutes before our server greeted us and asked what we wanted to drink by then we knew to order everything right away because we could tell it was going to take awhile for our waiter to come back. So my girlfriend and I ordered sweet tea and the basic chicken and waffles. The food took around 20-25 minutes to come out and I was already on my 3rd sweet tea. The food turned out to be pretty decent even though I was expecting more. My waffles were a little burnt along with my chicken. I was disappointed in my meal. My girlfriends meal was perfectly cooked. I couldn't finish my meal and it was a little too sweet for me.   As of now my review of this place stands at a 3 stars due to the service and the food. I plan on coming back soon and giving this place another shot! It has great potential.",

I always end up waiting forever to order and receive my food. I called yesterday to place an order to go, which I've done before. This time they claimed that they don't take orders over the phone.  If you're trying to pick a restaurant, go to Miss White's instead. It's a hole in the wall, but the food is much better and the people are nicer.",

There was a long line and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait...however it turned into an hr wait.   I got the sweet tea (decent) and drumsticks over mac and cheese with a side of onions and mushrooms.   The sweet tea was pretty authentic and came in a huge mason car for $3.50.   We ordered our food around 1pm and it came out almost an hour later..... The place was busy but the food probably should not have taken an hour to come out. I think something was wrong with their fryer. The manager came out after an hour after we kept asked where our food was. She apologized and brought out the food around 15 min later. They also mixed up one of the orders and gave the girl the completely wrong order. My co -worker who ordered the catfish platter only got one of the meats he ordered because the fryer was broken. I think it was just bad news bear overall. They gave us free banana bread pudding at the end but it wasn't really consolation for what happened.   The drumsticks were pretty dry - popeyes is def better. I would give the mac and cheese 5 stars- def tasted homemade and I really enjoyed it but otherwise the food was just average.  Service was friendly but the food took way too long to come out and the whole food mix-up was def a turn off.",

    "text": "To some people, myself included, the concept of chicken and waffles originally sounded absolutely ludicrous. Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.  I've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!  The waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.  I've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside. This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.  I insist on ordering Kool Aid. Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!    We've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.    While not everything on the menu is flawless, it's good quality and it's cheap. I have very little to complain about and for that, I give it a strong recommendation!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place for the first time. We got there at around 12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon and despite the place being packed, we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, our waitress took our drink order and by the time she came back we were ready to order. We both ordered chicken and waffles because, duh. We waited and waited and waited. Our waitress never came by after she dropped off our drinks until we saw her bringing the tables food across from us that was sat about 15 min after we were seated. We asked her how much longer we'd be waiting and she said, \"oh your food should be next because they just got theirs\", referring to the tables food she just brought over. We told her that they'd actually been seated about 15 min after us and she said \"oh yeah, ok let me check\". Then we never saw her. By this time the place was cleared out with only a few full tables and everyone around us got seated, ate and left all in the time we were waiting. So in the meantime, we asked three people total if we could speak with a manager, the first two said they'd go get them but no one approached us. The third person we asked was actually the woman who brought our food out. She let us know there was no manager on duty and there was a lead but that she could help us. We explained the situation and by this time we were there for an hour already after being seated, still waiting on food. She was very nice and helpful and comped what she could off the check. We never saw our actual waitress until she dropped the check and said \"she took off one of the meals\" and walked away. Wtf is this girls problem? Not once did we yell or were rude to her. She didn't gaf about our table since we placed our order and clearly didn't care to apologize or anything after we'd been waiting for an hour. The other woman who wasn't our waitress was the only one to come by and check on us after we got our food. The food was good but we were so annoyed with how long we waited and then how the waitress was to us after everything. So Lo-Lo's gets one star for the food and one star for the woman who actually gave AF about our table.",

In my home however, it is simply food. Regular old, Sunday night  food. Good food: absolutely. Exceptional food: nah.   Maybe this is because  the mac and cheese and fried chicken taste exactly the same as what I place on my table for family get-togethers. However, if it is food that you do not know how to cook on your own I would suspect that you'd find it delightful.   Pros: mac & cheese and fried chicken are very good. Homefries are to die for. Good service and drinks are served in jars (gotta love that).  Cons: You have to wait in the blistering heat to be seated, the place is extremely small and don't be fooled by the Famous red velvet cake. It taste like red cornbread with icing and walnuts. Very good icing and walnuts but all the same just a spiced up cornbread.  Overall: Good experience. Good food and yes if I head out of Cali to Phoenix again I will go back.",

Despite the seemingly hip menu and twist on traditional black dishes, this restaurant has no interest or savvy in dealing with POC from the management level. I came in from California with my parents and we stopped because they had heard good reviews. I was fighting a cough and purchased some tea at the airport to soothe my throat. When we arrived here, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, with our hostess Victoria seating is with personalised suggestions and our server Sir adeptly explaining the menu and clarifying Abby questions. After being seated and ordering drinks, the manage AJ comes and stands over me at the table. He explains that there is no outside food or drinks. I acknowledge and return scanning my menu. After hovering over my shoulder he then states that he is going to take drink. I stated I understand the policy and ask if he can either expedite my drink or provide a glass for me to finish while I waited. He ignores my request and states either take the drink back to my car or he will take it. He then proceeds to stand menacingly over me, refusing to allow me to finish making my menu selection and restates he is going to take my drink, finally grabbing it off the table and tossing it out. Afterwords he does nothing to check on or expedite the drink I ordered and avoids the dining area. Working in food service for several years I was shocked by the openly combative nature of the exchange, the only solution was HIS solution. I thought the customer was always right, it looks like at the Phoenix Lo-Lo's, AJ is always right. Shout out to the excellent servers, but I absolutely cannot recommend this as a safe space to dine for POC while AJ is around.",

The waffles remind me of Waffle House waffles, and that's a good thing!    I had the chicken tenders and you could tell they were breaded in the kitchen and no pre-frozen. My wife had the chicken and waffles and she really enjoyed it!    Overall, I highly recommend this place!",

DO NOT expect the wait/bus staff to help you if this happens to your children.  2 servers and a bus boy stood there, frozen not sure what to do.  They all looked so unprofessional, like they had not seen someone throw up before.  The bus boy stood there with a wet towel in his hand, while another waiter (from a different station) had to jump in and hand me napkins.  For you parents out there...you know \"paper\" napkins only go so far.  I had to literally tell the bus boy to give me the wet rag he was holding, before he snapped out of his staring trance and walked away.  We have always loved   LoLo's, however this time was very different.  The staff was so unprofessional and cold towards us.  We saw a manager walk past us and look 3 times and he never once stopped to see what had happened or checked on us to see if we needed anything.  So disappointing!",

The fried chicken here is moist, crunchy, flavorful, and all that real southern fried chicken is supposed to be. The Mac-n-cheese is a great pairing and the waffles here are delectable.   The owner has been there each time that I have been, and he has always asked how things were, taking orders, seating people, etc. I love a hands on family owned business that has really yummy food.    I have not been to the one in Scottsdale, because I am not a Scottsdale fan. I also have not had enough room in my stomach to try the red velvet cake. One day I will get to try the cake.  If you can avoid going here after church on Sunday than you may not wait in a very long line, like I always end up getting! But, nonetheless, I am impressed!",

We sat down and ordered our food. I got the KK's. Everything on that sounded good they give you 2 eggs also with cheese and onion and I asked for no cheese or onion. I also ordered side French fries. I got my food and noticed cheese and onions on my eggs I asked for new ones because I didn't want that. I also did not get the French fries I didn't bother asking I wanted to see if they would put it on my tab at the end. They brought out new eggs and they weren't even cooked. Like literally my friends were also disgusted. If you moved the plate you could see the egg white just bouncing around. It wasn't wear like it was just the yolk not cooked it was every part of the egg so I didn't eat it. The fried chicken is good and so are the waffles which why I was satisfied because of those but it's nothing to WOW about. I had a very bad experience and honestly this will not be my choice for breakfast. Also at the end my tab had fries on it so I told them I didn't get it the guy went \"oh okay\" and took it off but did not even apologize or anything else.",

It comes in this big ice cold pitcher!! The Red Velvet cake is a True Southern delight, and being from Texas, I think it's perfect. Also the Chrizo is ace!!!

The place isn't incredibly big, but tables fill the middle portion, so we weren't sure why it took so long.  Anyways onto the food. We decided to try their traditional fried chicken and waffles and were underwhelmed. The waffles were good (but how can you mess those up), but the chicken was decent. The pitfall was the gravy. I like gravy, but the gravy here was too much. My chicken was doused and drowning in it. I didn't get the fried chicken feel that I wanted.   Best part about the place was the kool aid. We both forgot how good kool aid was. It was so good that the little one drank a quarter of the mason jug. Staff was friendly, but food was okay. Hopefully the other location is better.",

Best food of this particular expedition to Phoenix, and there are still a couple days left in my trip. This will be hard to beat, though.  Chef May? About your place down in Tucson? Yeah this is what you're trying to achieve. Please come take notes.  This is a silly thing to be happy about, perhaps, but I am always slightly irritated when I get a 6oz plastic tumbler stuffed with ice and a few drops of water. I drink water, a lot of it, and I don't normally get other drinks. Good service, an extra cup, a pitcher at the table, these are all things that can mitigate this. Lo-Lo's sidesteps it completely by providing 1L mason jars of water (I believe I saw kool-aid too) by default. I didn't even need a refill.  I was so massively over-full that I couldn't try the red velvet cake but I'm almost considering driving back down there and getting a piece to go, the way other yelpers go on about it.",

The waffle itself was good, but the taste of the chicken was not made to perfection. Usually I get a chicken breast but this time I got the thigh, so perhaps that contributed to the low satisfaction of its taste.

I ordered the Lil Amida with side order of grits and sweet tea to was it down.  My taste buds and my soul was awaken. Such great food and my colleagues were also raving about the choices they made.

I may be an adult but I still love Kool Aid and it's not often you come across a place that serves it. I drank so much I was ready to float away. I ordered the Puffs chicken tender basket with a waffle instead of fries. You also get a choice of bbq or ranch for your tenders. I opted for the ranch and it was just ok. I prefer to eat my chicken with the waffle and syrup anyways. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffle was tender and delicious. We all ordered the same thing at the table but we also shared a side of Mac and cheese which was super creamy and delicious. A major improvement of per the Kraft we usually have at home.  The service started out a bit slow but finished strong. Our server was very friendly. The atmosphere is bright, fun and casual.  My entree, Kool Aid and tip came to $21.00.

But I'm not the type who will crave chicken in the morning. Definitely a one or two time experience. Prices a little too high for what it is. Plus, they're always packed  I can get a full a delicious meal at U.S. Egg. Including a mimosa.",

It does seem that they changed their gravy recipe, and maybe not for the best.  As far as service, it is always weird to wait for a table, then be seated only to see 3-5 tables open. We have discovered the ability to check in online, so when we get the craving we are not standing in central waiting for 40 minutes. The last time I was in I saw a large group taken to a booth that was obviously too spall for their party, the host then seated at a table, and then they were asked to move for a different party. It just feels a little unorganized and distracting while we are in the restaurant. If you can get past it you will most likely LOVE the food and ultimately that will probably encourage you to return 3-4 times per year.",

Had the lo los and the chicken was fantastic, juicy and flavorful. Waffles were great and we filled up quick. Kids got French toast and pancakes and enjoyed them. Ambiance is chill and welcoming.

Other restaurants outside of California and Arizona are now trying to catch up to this incredible food. Fluffy soft cinnamon touched waffles with crispy delicious chicken. It's a soul food original and an absolute MUST STOP if you are near downtown.   I ordered the Toy Toy which was two wings and a waffle, I added an extra waffle and grits on the side. The grits were buttery and everything else was exactly as I imagined them in my head. The waffle needs an entire review of themselves, so fluffy, buttery, delicious, heavenly, scrumptious, and amazing! There has to be some added work to the waffles because these don't taste like the ones you make at home! They soak up so much syrup and butter that each bite just explodes (pause) in your mouth. They are also one of the only joints that serves you Kool-Aid in a jar. I ordered Red and it was delicious! Yes Red, don't hit me with Fruit Punch or Tropical punch. It's Red.   You absolutely have to go. It's one of the most amazing restaurants in the area if you love brunch and even if you have to wait it's definitely worth it! Go now.",

Having been in PHX several times now, I was ready to try something new - and what's better than some c&w for lunch?!  West of the airport, Lolo's is in a cool renovated brick building - to me it felt more like a lunch than dinner spot, also because of the location.  The atmosphere definitely fits the concept (modern-rustic kinda made me want a beer type ...) and was comfortable to hang out in! The service was spot on and our server was fun.  Their menu is definitely heavy (I hope they never have to list calories!) but you know that going in. The menu has a large variety, all day breakfast, burgers, of course chicken/waffles and southern staples such as fried tomatoes, etc ... they have a platter option which I felt was a great way to get a flight across their menu. I had fried chicken and waffles with a side of mac'n'cheese - post nap optional. Everything was hands down delicious and everyone on our table really enjoyed their meal! Everything was well seasoned, the chicken was crispy and the waffles well made!   Someone else recommended to eat chicken and waffles in the same bite ... ditto that and make sure to dip it in maple sirup! I'd recommend this place any day, it's different than you average lunch place and a fun atmosphere!",

The fried gizzards had no seasoning complained twice to the manager and to the waitress manager said he would look into it which took him 30 minutes to give me the same thing. Then the waitress said the side of spinach is really good. .that was horrible bland no seasoning. Then I requested for a side of rice and beans all I got was beans lol baked beans. Waitress was like well I can bring a side of rice. I'm not sure but I thought this place was suppose to be a southern mamas cooking. They kept forgetting our refills and the waitress forgot one of my kid pancake poor kid didn't get it till 15 minutes before we were done. We complained but manager excused was oh it new years day.

She was short, no smile and looked like she was done for the day and we were inconveniencing her. She only came 3 times to our table, first to bring drinks, then food and then check. Another server who was tending to the table in front of us came over to ask if we have been helped.. I ordered iced tea with some ice water same thing my husband ordered. She brought the iced teas and forgot our waters. After asking for it again, she forgot to bring and then we did not bother. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, We ordered our food on her second visit to our table. Food arrived in other 15-20 minutes later but it was what my husband had ordered. I had to wait another 10 minutes before my food came, while  my husband waited for my to get my food. Food arrived hot, brought by another staff member. Mine was very greasy, there was so much oil around my eggs but grits and waffle were good. My husband's food was great- no complaints whatsoever. While we ate and finished, she did not come to check if food was okay and that is when the other server tending to next table, stopped by to ask if we were okay. My husband mentioned to the server about our server Alexis and that she has no time for the guest. He apologized on her behalf. And we asked for our check. This was a hopeless visit, we had better experience at the Scottsdale location. I am sure we would had a better experience if we had another server, as there were others that we found were smiling and chatting and looked happy to be there. We would rather go to Scottsdale building than this one!",

    "text": "Leaning more toward a 3.5 star rating.  I've been coming to Lo Lo's since before the remodel at this location. Recently it's has been a hit or miss. First starting with the wait. I'm used to waiting at least 30 to 45 minutes for a table so the wait time doesn't bother me because I expect it.  I'm not really sure what has happen to the customer service here but ever since the remodel it has not been a priority. Any contact that I have had with any of the staff whether it be the hostess, waiters/waitresses, and even the manager has been negative. After having to deal with the parking nightmare and the wait for a table you expect the experience to get better from there. Not the case here. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the food.   I usually order the smothered chicken and waffles or the fried catfish with mac and cheese and greens. There was only one time that I had a problem with the food not coming out hot and in a timely manner. They recently came out with an alcoholic beverage menu but I prefer the kool aid. They also have a breakfast menu. You will never leave hungry and the prices are very reasonable.   I really hope that they are able to turn this place around when it comes to customer service. I always recommend this place to anyone visiting Phoenix but with the service declining I'm hesitant to throw their name out there as a recommendation.",

Place was dirty inside, sticky menus, flies everywhere, crumbs all over chairs and floor. Our waitress was nice, however it took 55 minutes to get our food after ordering. Then they forgot to bring a side and after asking the waitress for it, it took about 10 minutes to get the forgotten side. The entire visit was at least an hour and a half for a family of 4, which is way too long for chicken & waffles. I do love Lolos, I'll just be going to the Scottsdale location from now on.",

It is one of the best creations that has ever existed in the food world!! Our wait was about 50 minutes (I've waited longer for dim sum at Great Wall so this was no comparison). Haha. The outside of the restaurant looks a little run down, but I believe that is the look that the restaurant is going for. The inside was very upbeat and comfortable. The restaurant was packed and the servers were really busting their butts to serve everyone.   Since this was my first time there and I didn't know when I would come back again, I decided to order more than I could eat just to get a taste of everything. Promptly after we ordered, our food came out. My boyfriend ordered the \"Yo Mamma's Biscuits and Gravy\" with a side order of chicken thigh. I ordered the Betty's Boob, Mac and cheese, corn bread, and banana pudding! Everything was amazing! The chicken was very lightly battered with delicious seasoning and deep fried to perfection! The inside of the chicken was still moist and fully cooked. You can't get that at many restaurants! My cousin ordered their fresh lemonade in a jar and I have to say... It was the BEST lemonade I ever had! It wasn't like the Minute Maid crap that makes your mouth gritty and feels like the sugar is decaying away at your teeth. This was freshly squeezed stuff!   Overall, the experience was amazing! Our servers were friendly, prompt, and attentive to our needs! You can bet that I'll be coming back here again!",

    "text": "First time visiting any lo-lo's Chicken & Waffles. My mother and i were greeted very promptly at the door. The establishment was very popular at the moment. However we were sat immediately. Our server came over in a timely manner and took our drink order. I would have liked to know her name but she had no name tag like her fellow associates. Drinks were delivered very timely but the water was a bit dissatisfying. In this case I had ordered a bottle water. In the mean time we sat and observed tables around us. There was another server in the back room where we were who seemed very friendly and delivering great service to her tables. Our server however seemed very frantic. It was some time and i had still not received my bottled water. She visited a table next to us with drinks leaving her tray on the table where guest were sitting. They also had to get attention from other servers to get a high chair, which was asked for in the beginning. The most attention we received was maybe a glance or two. Finally we got a visit from her and we ordered or food. My mother ordered a chorizo skillet and I the tre tres with a side of banana foster. Food was delivered within 10min. We began to eat but needed attention for a side plate, the forgotten water, condiments and also tortillas. By the time she came over I was almost through with my food and my mother's food untouched due to the need of tortillas. We voiced or needs and she left. By the time I received my water my food was finished. I asked to speak with a manger. The manager then came over and I voiced my concerns to him he didn't have much to say and seemed unconcerned with first time guest. However he went back himself and grabbed the tortillas and that was that. My mother no longer had an appetite and we asked for the check. I was expecting and apology from our server but there was none. I assume the manger had said nothing to her. On our check i had noticed the charge for a side of bananas and a side of foster sauce instead of just a side of banana foster. No compensation was given do to the bad experience. Over all not a great first time will not be returning any time in the future. I suggest smaller sections and more servers.",

This place not only provided rest customer service, it was very tasty, fulfilling and full of flavor.   We were seated in no time, served by a respectful & customer friendly guy named \"Sir\". Not only did he go out his way to give us the full LoLos experience he made sure everything was great the whole time.   Thanks for showing this L.A girl that taste and soul runs all the way to Phoenix!",

They already had a seat for me, so I didn't have to wait. The Waitress was right on top of taking care of us with a great personality and huge genuine smile!  We visited a little bit and then Boom- our food was there!   I had the Lo-Lo's and it was delicious!  It came with 3 pieces of crispy fried chicken and 2 large waffles with butter and maple syrup. I didn't need anything else! The taste was fabulous with just a hint of cinnamon in the waffles and the just right fried chicken!  Washed it all down with lemon water in a large Mason Jar glass! There was no room for dessert for any of us.   Check it out!!",

Waffles are good but I remember them being crispy before not so much now but still good. The service is always A+. Usually always a super busy location so the wait can take a while for the food to come out. Not today it was out in less than 10 min or so. That was kind of a shocker. I love their ice tea, it can be a bit sweet for me personally so I always order half sweet half unsweeted and that's perfect for me.",

The chicken was crunchy on the outside but still juicy in the inside. The waffle was a perfect compliment with their maple syrup? Yum! And the hot sauce that they have in lo-los soooo delicious. The Mac and cheese was perfect. A perfect blend of cheese and so full of flavor. The sweet tea was super sweet but honestly I loved it! I really loved my experience in lo-los so I always wanted to come back when I came. However, each time I would come back it seemed like the food wasn't consistent and it just wasn't the same. The chicken was so dry and I tried to save it with some hot sauce but that didn't fix anything. The chicken is supposed to be the main star but for some reason it just isn't that same quality It once had.",

Came here for #smunch this past Saturday morning with some of Phoenix' finest ... and I am positive no one was disappointed.. I got the Betty Boop which consisted of a juicy breast of chicken and a large, butter soaked waffle with hints of cinnamon.. when I say butter soaked, I am not even exaggerating. Delicious! Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!  Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely.   AmazingaZING!",

Had fried chicken, a waffle, cornbread, and the candied yams.  Best thing were the yams!  Chicken was alright.  Waffle was too thin, light in color, and soggy.  It didn't help to witness one of the staff sneaking in the back with a bag of Bisquick while I was waiting for a table.  I thought the waffles and batter were homemade??  Cornbread didn't even compare to Redfish or Z'Tejas!  Honestly, it tasted like the dried versions I tried at Big City BBQ and Marie Callender's... Tsk, tsk.  If I were to return, it would only be for the candied yams/sweet potatoes.  Those deserved 5 stars!",

Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good.

That said, I can now cross \"Eat at Lo-Lo's\" off my \"things to do at least once\" list.   Dottsy described the chicken perfectly. It was not greasy nor soggy. I did not find it especially flavorful but did pick up on the baking soda.   I was expecting a much denser waffle but found it to be thin and limp.   The mac and cheese was super creamy and had hints of cream of mushroom soup.   Nothing was really memorable for me, except the collard greens. For some reason, that's the flavor that remains most vivid. They had a delicious healthy greens flavor with a nice chili flake kick.   So, Lo-Lo's didn't knock my socks off but Lo-Lo's isn't really for me. It's for people who love fried chicken... so, if that's you, I suggest you not miss this place! You'll probably really like it!!",

    "text": "The first thing that I saw, when I walked up to put my name on the list to be seated, were a bunch of white people and an Asian guy.  The girls taking down names were Latinas.  The first thought that popped into my head was \"Where all the soul brothas and sistas at?!?\"  You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?  But, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.  So not cool, when it's already 100 degrees at 10am.    Can you see me sweating?  Not pretty.  After a 35 minute wait, we were quickly shuffled into the a cramped little room.  Our orders were quickly taken.  Not even ten minutes later, the food arrived.  My \"Toy-Toy\" (two fried wings with a waffle) was delish!!  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy in the middle.  Finger lickin goodness.  The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.    I have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.    Despite the crampedness (is that even a word?) of the place, I'm still giving it a full 5-stars.  It's worth the wait and worth being up close and personal with your tableside neighbor.  Customer service quick and friendly.  Yes, it's a hole-in-the-wall place, but that's what makes it even more authentic.  It's unique, has a great vibe and great food.  Next time, I'm making room for some of the red velvet cake.",

    "text": "*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!  Ok, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.    I got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.    So, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.    Anyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.  So, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.  While I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!  Needless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.  I will probably return, but probably not for some time.",

If you've never had chicken and waffles together, its a delightful combination but don't expect it to a miraculous union. It simply is fried chicken and waffles, you just happen to be eating them simultaneously.  My favorite part about Lo-Lo's are the dranks. They are served in large mason jars can choose from the standard fountain drinks, sweet tea or red and grape kool-aid. Yes, red is a flavor.

Things I've tried there:  LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.  Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!  Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.  My food always arrive and taste just as good as the last time as to their Scottsdale location, the food doesn't taste the same to me.  Maybe I'm just trippin' but that's how I feel.    Overall, this place is pretty awesome.  I can't wait for them to finish their expansion.",

    "text": "Have I really never reviewed Lo-Lo's? Seriously??   This morning, Dottsy, Robert M and I headed for SoDo (is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown?) for some chicken and waffle perfection. Lo-Lo's hits the mark on everything: my gravy and onion covered chicken was all sorts of awesomeness, the waffles were golden brown loveliness, the greens were bang on, the mac and cheese a creamy blissful experience, the red beans and rice were smartly appealing and the fried okra was splendid happiness. Sure, we ordered a lot of sides, but we wanted to be fair.   Lo-Lo's was like a religious experience--Sunday service was being played on the radio, there were babies crying, their food is also served in Heaven (or at least that's keeping me focused on the afterlife).   As well as being perfectly filled with some of the best food ever, we also had a marketing brainstorming session. The first was a tour of some great soul food restaurants using Metro and make it into a UYE. Its name? Pause for dramatic effect: The Soul Train. Something else came up but we're keeping a tight lid on that project.",

    "text": "What a perfect treat after a strenuous cardiovascular workout?! This Phoenix secret is definitely on my list of restaurants to visit again. Just don't eat here too often as the fare is high in carbs and saturated fat. The food is served hot out of the kitchen as soon as it's ready, so there is little wait time. It's a good idea to remember your order number and meal name as the person bringing out the order probably won't be your server. Although the service was rushed, it's what I expected from a busy, family-owned restaurant on a Sunday morning.   Before a table was clear, I was reminded of waiting outside to be seated at a popular restaurant in New York City in the chilly winter wind and snow, expect it was a warm fall morning and we were definitely not in Manhattan. The decor was minimal, but clean and finding the place took some extra effort (if you are coming from the north on Central its right after Buckeye and there is no sign). For a taste of the Southeast right in the middle of the Southwest, stop in at LoLo's, fo' sho'.",

It seemed like a cultural tradition I really needed to start embracing.  And if you make the trip and are prepared to wait around an hour in eager anticipation of such a feast, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. It's a converted house without much in the way of seating and usually plenty of people ready to raise their cholesterol levels a couple notches. We've even had several celebrity sightings going there to add to the commotion. As such, you typically wait 30 minutes for a table at lunch time unless you get there early. You will also likely spend an hour or more at the table with the glacial Southern service.  You have to get chicken and waffles the first time you go, preferably with a side and some of their red velvet cake to go. But they have several other unhealthy options and a good amount of breakfast food if that's what your in the mood for. But make no mistake, there is NO healthy option at this place. Don't go there unless you are ready to indulge.  I would also strongly recommend NOT going there with large groups. I see there are 4 votes for \"Good for Groups\" for this place. That is insane. There are hardly any tables and large groups bring the place to grinding halt. Go with 4 or 5 people max.",

Sex and chocolate don't count.\"    If I still lived in Phoenix, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles would definitely be one of my vices.  The chicken is pure fried goodness. The mac n'cheese is creamy and crispy goodness. The waffles are BEYOND DELICIOUS.    If I could give any future LoLo's consumers a hint it would be this: if you are sensitive to too much sugar like I am, don't waste your precious pancreatic islets on the beverages.  I succumbed to the peer-pressure and got an Arnold Palmer, which of course comes in a quart-sized Mason jar.  I reached my sugar capacity before the meal even started.  I can only imagine the explosion of flavor in my mouth I would have experienced had I not wasted all my buds on sweetened tea and lemonade.",

    "text": "Being a white girl from Gilbert I never thought I would eat at a place that combines fried chicken with waffles.  The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.  Sometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.  When the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of \"mush\" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.  There is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.  Lo-Lo's, I will love you forever, my body be damned.",

If you're hungry, I recommend ordering 3 piece meal.  For dessert, we ordered the red velvet cake.   Overall, the fried chicken was good but we've had better in Texas and California.  The red velvet cake was delicious, very moist.  And the Lemonade was great!  The service is good as my lemonade was never empty.   I'm not sure if we would come back to Lolo's but it was A - OK!",

Delicious, golden brown waffles with  a touch of cinnamon and enough butter to qualify you for a free coronary stent if you bring your receipt from breakfast to any local hospital. 4. Real grits. Cheese optional (highly recommended). Also served with an obscene amount of butter. 5. Fried okra, red velvet cake, Kool Aid (also in ginormous mason jars), the list goes on  This place oozes character, charm, incredible food, not to mention half melted butter that seems to find it's way onto anything and everything on your plate (and really what isn't made better with melted butter?).  LoLo's also serves as an excellent litmus test to see if that new guy/gal you've been seeing are going to work out in the long run. Anyone who can plow through a number 1 is A-OK in my book.",

My friend was in the know, however, because he ordered half-regular and half-sweet which STILL tasted way too sweet for me.  The saltiness of the fried chicken mixed with the sweetness of the waffles is an unholy and remarkable combination.  Make sure you get there early because the line is long.

As a tourist in Phoenix, I would never have found this place on my own but as a fan of fried chicken, I'm so glad Yelp pointed me in its direction.  Lo-Lo's is a small restaurant on a side street with street parking. It has a real mom and pop family atmosphere as you walk in.  As I wanted to try the famous red velvet pie for dessert, I limited myself to trying the fried chicken and waffles, which sounded an odd combination to a British palate. Well, the fried chicken was great but not the very best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffles were nice but I'm still not 100% sure they're the best fit for fried chicken. There was so much else on the menu I wanted to try but my stomach had no space left. The red velvet cake was nice and sweet but the portion size defeated this British stomach!

None of my fears were warranted. There's ample street parking at Lolo's. If you have to hoof it a little to get there, you'll appreciate the walk back to the car. And you'll need it to burn off a fraction of what you've just put down. At peak times, things get a little hectic inside. There's not much of a waiting space but the Lolo's staff is friendly and helpful, they'll get your butt in a seat as quickly as they can. They'll also guide you toward places to stand where you won't be a hazard to the heavy trafficking of chicken, collared greens, mac and cheese and, of course, waffles going on.   Once you're seated, eat it all.   Seriously though, there's a Lolo's platter for everyone and plenty of sides. Service is friendly and efficient without be hurried or quick. That said, this place is all about the food. It's my favorite place to take out-of-town guests. In short, Lolo's is the type of place that Phoenix can be proud of.",

I would quilt these waffles together and sleep beneath it after having stacked a bunch of these waffles on top of each other in the form of a mattress. then i would wake up in the morning and eat those waffles. rinse, repeat.  great hot sauce too by the law. also, can't go wrong with the fried green tomatoes.",

It was really good but prepare to spend your time there. lol it was about 2 + hours by the time we were seated ordered and ate; they forgot the potatoes with my breakfast and we waited about 30 mins for them to bring them out. It was only my husband and I so not a huge complicated order.   Drinks are super expensive at $3.50 each for a simple soda not one of the specialty teas or lemonades, but they did let us take a refill out  to go when I asked.   Other comment the patrons are LOUD- we were in one of those half booths with people about 2 feet away on the long bench who were cackling loudly when they laughed. They were a table of 4 and they were obnoxiously loud. I shot them a couple looks like really??? Not necessary to be that loud when you laugh and talk. We left with a headache. When they got a phone call at the table they took the call and the other 3 toned it down a little so the person could talk, so clearly they were.Capable. But the person who took the call and had a whole conversation on the phone spoke super loudly. Oy vey!  The chicken was Crispy and tender the waffles got soggy since they were stacked on each other but the flavor was decent. My egg over easy was good. My husband got the chicken omelette with a waffle and that was very good. Potatoes were decent, not many on the order but not sure they were worth a 40 min wait!",

The koolaid is lusciously sweet and you get a huge, full glass. The lemonade is yum too!  The real deal surprise of our visit was the ribeye steak and eggs. Mr. G opted to pay $4 for the extra 8 ounces of steak option. And boy was it worth it. We both LOVE ribeye and this one has got to be one of the best we have ever tasted. It was cooked perfectly and tasted fantastic. Fortunately I got a taste before he ruined it by putting his over easy eggs on top of it. So delicious. Highly recommend you try the ribeye at this already tasty spot.   Enjoy!",

It's usually impossible to get my boyfriend to wait to be seated for anything longer than 15 minutes. I insisted, however, as I had heard so many wonderful things about this establishment.   This place was very clean and had a very nice \"homey\" vibe about it. My water came in a mason jar, which was a nice touch.   In True fashion, I ordered a chicken and waffle plate. The chicken was phenomenal. Crunchy and very flavorful. The waffle was fluffy, buttery and creamy. No complaints here about the chicken and waffles.   My boyfriend, however, had the catfish plate. The sides were bland, corn bread dry and catfish average at best.   So, for what this places is known for, chicken and waffles, way to go! Not so much for their fish and side dishes. Definitely worth a try!",

The spices they use to fry their chicken are phenomenal, every bite has so much flavor. I am personally a fan of the chicken breast and get my waffle extra crispy which is a must.   Also, get the Kool aid most of the flavors are amazing. Didnt give them 5 Stars due to the fact that sometimes I have to wait forever to get my food and others they forget to make my waffle crispy and personally cannot handle the soft waffle  but that's just me.",

Everyone is so chill and friendly, it makes you definitely want to come back. Do not order a soda. Do not order a water. Order Kool Aid with Lemonade! I get the red Kool aid with lemonade and I'm never let down. Their Kool aid is always on tap, so make sure to ask for those free refills and a to-go cup. 10/10 would recommend their chicken and waffles... It's what their famous for! Duh! Don't get me wrong, their Oreo pancakes and red velvet cake are to die for. But you can always take that to-go after you eat those waffles and fried chicken. Their waffles are fluffy and golden while their chicken is crunchy and fried. So yummy! I'm getting hungry while writing this. You won't be disappointed.",

The only bad thing I can say about this place (which isn't a bad thing for them) was that we waited for over an hour to be seated. Probably because there were 10 of us. Server was on point, nice, and generous.  He was very sociable and it was overall a good atmosphere for me.  Food: Awesometastic (yeah that's my own word). They got kool-aid too. I will definitely be returning",

I've been to Lolo's on multiple occasions and it was always amazing, but after yesterday, I don't think i'll ever give them any business again. It took nearly an hour to get our food. The waiter took the wrong order and then it took him 20 minutes to bring out the right food since he stopped to talk with the guy about the Mayweather fight on the table next to us. The food was not good. I usually splurge when I come to Lolo's but yesterday it was horrible. My toddler didn't even eat their mac and cheese. It was so dry and disgusting. No more Lolo's for me.   We ordered two meals and my total came out to be almost $40.",

    "text": "Best waffles ever. Seriously. Now pair those perfectly cooked, cinnamon-y waffles with the best fried chicken, best shrimp and grits, and best banana pudding. Ever. Those are pretty much the only things I've tried... Oh and bacon but honestly, bacon is always amazing. Pretty much any where you go I recommend eating bacon. Moving on...  Before going to Lo-Lo's there are a few things you should know... 1. This is not a place to go when on a diet or attempting to make healthy choices. You CAN eat healthy here (egg whites and turkey bacon anyone?) BUT it's no fun!!! Why eat egg whites when you can eat grits oozing with butter, crispy always fresh fried chicken, and waffles drenched in sticky syrup? Splurge here, it'll be worth it. 2. The neighborhood this location is in is a tiny bit sketchy. Do NOT let this stop you from visiting. The place itself is not the least bit sketchy and the staff are all amazing.  3. It's pretty small (they are currently building a larger space.) There could be a wait when you go (especially with a large group.) But the service is fast and the food comes out quickly. So fear not!  Now... If you made it to the end of this review, you either still have doubts about the amazingness of this place (or you would already be on your way there) OR you are just preparing yourself for your carb party. Either way, hurry. Deliciousness is waiting.",

I walked in the restaurant and was instantly greeted by the friendly hostess. We were sat within 3 minutes (which was pretty good because I've been told that it gets BUSY especially on the weekends)  Our waitress took good care of us. I got the 3 piece chicken with waffles as well as grits and  scrambled eggs with onions and cheese. The fried chicken tasted soo good! You know how sometimes when you deep fry a chicken, sometimes the white meat inside get's excessively oily and greasy--the chicken here was perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist in the inside. The eggs were AMAZING.   They serve their drinks in large glass jars--I got the lemonade... yum!  I tried a bit of my friend's catfish sandwich, YUM! Next time I visit, I'm going to have to get that!  Definitely go to Lolo's! There's also one in Scottsdale too if you're in that area ;)",

It came with plenty of syrup and butter but that didn't mask my disappointment. I think this place is just overrated and I would not be back again.",

I deducted because of parking, the hostile lady (mentioned by another Yelper, who also posted her photo), their insistence that people wait outside and the lack of adequate parking. I think that the parking and wait area issues needed to be addressed during the planning stages of the expansion/remodel. The place is beautiful, but lacks key components: a place for customers to wait (they have a patio with a misting system, but this may not suit everyone) and to park their vehicles. The hostile lady needs to go. That is a HR issue. Please don't tell people to wait outside in 100 degree plus weather.  On the bright side, they are so busy that they need more room ( add a second floor and acquire more parking?). I will park in the sketchy neighborhood, ignore the hostile lady and try to wait inside for their delicious food, but not everyone is willing to run a gauntlet for a meal. I am in love with their soul food platter, candy sweets, rice & beans, waffles, signature hot sauce and red velvet cake, so I will continue to be a customer.",

I understand that the seating is limited and there is little room inside the resturant, but what I didnt understand is why five parties that arrived after us, got seated before us.   Once inside we ordered and got our food in great time. The chicken, waffles, and mac n cheese were amazing! However, while trying to serve us in a quick manner, our french fries were old, cold, and dry. We ate with no complain (I mean after waiting for an hour and a half we were HUNGRY!) and had a good laugh with Carlos, one of our servers.  As we were getting ready to leave and pay the bill, the staff became rude. One man told us he couldnt have a crowd of 80 trying to pay at the same time. He sent us back to our table to have someone come and help us. After that they told us they could only split the bill in two, which meant that none of us got the correct change.   I love the food and relaxed feeling of eating at Lolo's but I will never return with a group larger than 5, since they seem less than capable of attenting to a large party.",

    "text": "All chicken dinners should start out with a side of waffle, don't you think?  A group of us went to Lo Lo's on Saturday night before the opening of Arizona Theatre Company's AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'. We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of \"Fats\" Waller.   The service was super-quick (although, it WAS quite early. We were there at 5:30 PM). Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter. I thought that was a good idea, but my husband said, \"Next time, I'm getting my own!\"   We started off with a waffle - yum - and then got our fried chicken (which I never, ever have, so that was a real treat), grits, cornbread, and mac & cheese.   OK, this is bad ... I'm getting hungry thinking about our food from last night. I think that's a sign that we will need to return sometime soon.   A note about credit cards: They informed us that they would not accept more than 2 transactions per party, which was good to know. Luckily, most people had cash, so we only had to have them run one card. Just be aware, as people are so used to handing over multiple credit/debit cards these days.",

Though it was really hectic trying to serve our table, they all had a great sense of humor and were just overall very friendly.  Now to the food. Man, who knew how good the fried chicken-waffle combo is. However to be honest, the fried fish was even better! If i ever go back here, that's the combo I'd be getting...fried fish and waffles. It sounds not as appetizing, but trust me! It's good!",

    "text": "BEST KOOL-AID EVER! Seriously, that's easily it's number one draw for me. Order a \"jar of drank\" and it'll come out to you, ice cold (which is a great refresher from the summer heat here) in a mason jar. Free refills during your visit and they'll even give you a styrofoam \"to-go\" cup if you request it.  On top of that, this was my FIRST official \"chicken and waffles\" experience and I was surprised at how well the two go together. The waffles are a perfect consistency: Not too crisp, not to fluffy. As for the chicken, it's fried with the perfect recipe and just add a little honey and you're golden! A delicious meal with large proportions. You'll struggle with a full stomach to finish such a treat!  Since my first visit, I've been to the \"infamous\" Rocco's Chicken and Waffles and then returned to Lo-Lo's and I must admit, Lo-Lo's is BY FAR the victor. There is no doubt in my mind that Lo-Lo's is leaps and bounds better than Rocco's. The food is better, the atmosphere is better, the service is better.  Lo-Lo's offers great service (the people that work here are really nice and hospitable), great atmosphere, great food, and, most importantly for me, GREAT KOOL-AID!  Definitely worth a visit.",

To speak plainly, it is the most disappointing restaurant I have ever been to.  I have numerous of complaints and the biggest glaring one was being served cold cornbread.  Yes.  COLD.  I get it's probably been sitting around for a hour or so or even yesterday's batch, but to not even throw it in the toaster or microwave just makes it gross.  Furthermore, the cornbread falls apart easily and crumbles the minute I stuck my fork in it.  It didn't even peel apart, just crumbled onto my plate.    The chicken was also very undeserving of all the praise other yelpers are giving it.  It was dry, bland, and tasteless and I got thighs, which is one of the most moist area of the chicken.  The breading was very mediocre and there was zero flavor in the chicken itself.  I have to say I am very disappointed in Lo-Lo's.  You may like it, but I didn't have a good experience at all.",

I am thankful the waitress did realize we waiting a long time for food and brought my son some fries. The food was ok but when you see people seated well after you get food before you it leaves a bad taste as far as atmosphere and experience.   Its a good thing they didn't have anyone walking around asking how the service was they  would have gotten an ear full but maybe that's why they didn't since the service was poor.  I'm not sure if I will go back.  Really dissatisfied customer since wAs the first time meeting mother in law and it was her birthday.",

But the problem was that guest that came in well after us got there food before us. I asked the waiter why our food wasn't out yet, he said the fish was taking the longest. Now I cook and frying fish don't take that long. Once my food arrived, my gravy was cold and that wasn't a good look. It was fixed promptly but this is the FIRST time I've ever had this type of service since I've been coming here for the last 2yrs. HOPEFULLY on my visit the service will be different.",

    "text": "\"Where's the Soul Food\" is the question I hear the most from POC or people originally from the South that relocated to Phoenix.  When I relocated here and asked that question 5 years ago Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was the first place everyone told me to try.  So I did and was left unsatisfied.  On my first visit I went with the most requested \"Chicken and waffles\". I thought the chicken was entirely too greasy and the waffle was spongy.  On my second visit I opted for Smothered chicken with collard greens and mac and cheese.  Everything tasted so much better than my first experience but because everything was a tad bit too salty I didn't return.    Fast forward to 5 years later. I stopped in to Lo Lo's with a few folks from my meetup group for Sunday brunch.  We were a party of 8.  Out of 8 of us, 3 of us dined at Lo Lo's before.  The other 5 were total newbies.  In True newbie fashion they all ordered chicken and waffles, some added hot links, grits, catfish beignets and salmon cakes.  Everyone felt the same about the chicken and waffles.  They all felt like the waffles were too thick and spongy and the chicken was greasy and salty.  The grits were a hit amongst everyone.  The catfish beignets taste more like Pollock fish sticks, not catfish!  The salmon cakes are also made from canned salmon.  Just an FYI!  Not bad, but definitely not my cup of tea.",

This includes fried catfish, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes, rice with gravy, rice with butter, the sweetest, greasiest aMAZing cornbread and Kool aid so sweet your left foot will be numb and your A1C will be off the charts!  But let's get to the basics: seating. There are half booths and tables. If you're a wide body like me, try to get the half booths. If none are available use the wooden chairs, they're sturdier than the metal ones. There's plenty of space between tables, I only wish there were sturdier chairs for heavier heavenly bodies (like mine).   I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here. My usual go to's are the Catfish platter, Fried chicken platter, green beans with red potatoes, rice and gravy, cornbread and greens. I never order the Kool aid because they're just too sweet.   It's always busy and service can be hot or miss and be prepared to wait for your food when it's busy.   Enjoy yourselves.",

I wish I had ordered the croquettes because they were very good and q decent size. The waffles and chicken were good as well and they give you three different pieces of chicken with the waffle. So much food but so good",

I had the 2 piece chicken and a waffle and shrimp Mac and cheese...the shrimp Mac and cheese wasn't that good (to me). It was loaded with onions and bacon and really greasy in some parts! The waffle was yummy...crispy in some parts and soft in others...good balance! The prices were decent! Only gave 3 stars based on the long wait to get our food and bathroom",

My significant other and I were seated at such a small table that could barely fit our drinks on it. I had to set the hot sauce and sugar packets on the floor due to the fact that the table was built for toddlers. Our food arrived thirty-minutes after we ordered from our waitress, Alexis. She was sweet but did not tend to us much. She gave us two straws, that we dipped back and forth in between the water and kool-aid. She simply, took our order, and gave us the check.  The food was not as wonderful as expected. The chicken tasted like any other store bought chicken. As well as the waffles. They were hardly flavored wheat waffles. The only plus about our experience was the kool-aid. It was super sweet and delicious. It tasted like a melted Popsicle in the summer time. So yummy. All in all, we felt so crammed at our table we asked for boxes to go immediately. Arriving to this restaurant with a big appetite and leaving with a broken heart and empty tummy was not fun!  However, I will have to come back in future to grab another kool- aid drink and give it another go. For now, my significant other and I wasted fifty dollars on a sad meal. What a bummer.",

The menu is straight up soul food with lots of fried and smothered options. I opted for the Sheeda's Special which included a breast, wing, and one waffle. The food was delivered very fast combined with a large jar of unsweet iced tea.  My chicken was juicy and cooked well, although the coating had a bit too much flour. It was seasoned well and complimented the house hot sauce at each table. The waffle was large and fluffy with a nice cinnamon flavor and plenty of butter and syrup.  Lo-Lo's is a popular and fun option for those wanting to broaden their comfort zone for some good comfort food.",

This is why I've been here each time that I've been to PHX and I'll continue to come as long as the doors are open.  The Lo-Lo's Experience starts off AS USUAL, I'm greeted with a smile by one of the MANY, let me say it again, MANY beautiful staff members (fellas, fellas! !) I take my seat and another smiling face arrives, Ms. Allison, she's aiming to please but I'm a pro so I don't dilly dally, Sweet Tea and water to drink and Fried Green Tomatoes for my appetizer. These things are AWESOME all by themselves, they come with a sauce of some sort but naah, a drizzle of hot sauce, IF YOU LIKE, either way, TRY THESE. The seasoned bread crumbs give the perfect crunch and that hot, moist tomato! Savory Goodness!  I could've ended it there but that would be disrespectful to myself. For the entree I get the Salmon Croquettes, Cole slaw, Mac and Cheese and a biscuit that I'm sure has broken up a few homes! (WARNING, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO IT IN THE SOUTH, SKIP THE NEXT FEW SENTENCES!) The croquettes are hot from the pan, a bit of a skin on the outside but piping hot, moist and flaky inside. I top them with SYRUP, yes & yes!   The biscuits WILL be fought over during the reading of a will at some point. These things are the gold standard and they're ALWAYS consistent. Hot, soft but not doughy, a bit of flakiness but not falling apart and if, IF it makes it to the end of the meal, that last bite is just a good as when it first came out.  Tonight's drawbacks, the Mac and Cheese.  I had to send it back 3 times because it just wasn't hot enough. They figured it out but by the time they got it right I was just about full and eating a side of Mac and Cheese solo just makes me feel 6 yrs old all over again. I couldn't do it.(No disrespect to any 6 yr olds reading this, give mom or dad the phone back please.)  The manager came out, explained what went wrong, adjusted my check and even brought me a sample of an upcoming menu item. They were SOLD OUT of the \"Sock It To Me\" cake.  If you love great food, great atmosphere and great service, THIS. IS. A. MUST. STOP.",

Not the place for vegans or gluten free people or even vegetarians. It's a blue collar type of joint although I'm sure everyone is welcome. Well done Lo Lo's.",

The chicken had an amazing flavor! The waffle was oh so good! I also tried the banana & caramel pancakes & I didn't regret it!   I will be back (but earlier) I had to wait",

Unfortunately I can't eat waffles but I think I ate everything else that morning from chicken, potatoes, grits and even shared a piece of their oh so heavenly but sinfully good Red Velvet cake!

Here? By the chicken coop looking place?\" \"Yeah...\" \"Is it safe to leave the car here?\" \"Jessie-shush!\" \"I'm sure all these people will watch it getting stolen for me.   I'm an awful person-fine but you take one look at that street and tell me you don't feel the same. But all that matters is how awesome the food was. The drinks came in mason jars (tee hee) and our server was just so sweet! I loved the atmosphere and the comfy feeling in the air.   The chicken was cooked just right, the meat was juicy and I could have practically licked the plate to get the last of the jalapeno juices and mac and cheese bits. Why can't I eat like this every day?",

The waffles were the same as the last time. Good but not great. I would expect more from the waffles due to the fact that the word is in the name of the restaurant but overall they are fine. The kool aid was great with zero complaints about it.   Overall this place is very good and worth the time it takes to drive down to south Phoenix.  I will certainly come back if I'm in the area.",

Oh ok, and then when it came to be seated we were told we were not getting seated until entire party was here and by this time 8 of us were there, so I told her call us a party 8 and let's get breakfast going! I have to say though Lo Los was the place for huge parties sat morning, there were 2 other groups of 15 waiting to be seated as well.   We had 2 servers, a nice young lady and Jaqwan, and let me tell you, both servers were great!  Jaqwan was hot on making sure we were taken care of from drinks to food. Love a place with great service! And yes Lo Los was busy but they never looked or made us feel rushed!  I orderd the #8 betty boop , chicken breast with a waffle, I don't know what is it, but I can't get enough of that fried chicken! I don't even eat fried chicken but this place always has me craving more! This was my 1st time to the Phoenix location; I have been to the one in Scottsdale a number times, and I have to say I love the feel of this place, the opened ceiling in the main dining area, the nice comfy green sofa seating in the patio area, even the outside seating was nice, and it was a perfect day to be eating out side but I will have to try that another time.  So regardless of which location, I love me some Lo Los! You betcha I will be back!  Also would like to thank everyone who attends the breakfast club uye, its fun to see everyone and to have a great meal with! Thank you guys!",

Food wise, the waffle at Roscoe's is better. The waffle here was a little more doughy and not as flavorful. Chicken here is better though, crispy on the outside moist inside and flavorful but not salty. The \"dranks\" here are crazy sweet, I asked for a cup to pour out half my sweet tea and diluted it with half a glass of water lol. Same goes for the lemonade. The grits, mac and cheese and cornbread are yummy. Would love to come back and try some more side dishes!",

The first two times: It was before the new building and  was located in a tiny house with a Long  line and no parking. Second, pretty much the same story.  Today- Finally made it in. Ill start with this. Valet parking only. It's free ( But you have to tip, so not really free)    Always a wait- we went before lunch but after breakfast so the wait was only 10 mins. I've been to Roscoe's in Long Beach so I really didn't have a burning desire to wait that long. There are tons of restaurants in Phx- IMO I have never eaten at one that was worth a huge long time wait.     The staff was friendly. Waiter very nice. We had already looked at the menu online so we were ready to order. Food took awhile but they were busy so we expected as much, no problem. I ordered the chicken tenders with two sides- dirty rice and fries. Dirty rice wasn't on the menu anymore but I asked and they had it. Delish. My hubby ordered KK. We both liked everything we ordered. I feel they are a little pricey, but not overly. And everything tasted good so we would consider going back in the future. If my husband was writing this he would give 5 stars- he loved everything about LoLo's.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Lolos.  We heard great things about their food.  My sister wanted to go for her birthday so we decided to check it out.  It was a busy Sunday and the hostess quoted us for about 45 minutes.  We understood and waited patiently. After an hour wait we asked the hostess how much longer it would be since we had our two young children also waiting patiently and getting very hungry.  She said five more parties ahead of us.  We noticed people that were there after us getting seated before us.  People came and left before we were even seated.  We asked again, losing our patience at this point and the hostess said wrote the number wrong and skipped our name.  She saw us seating there the whole time and was not apologetic at all.   We do not like to be demanding and remained patient due to the fact that we all worked the service industry in the past.  It was extremely frustrating that they did not take into account their mistake and disregarded me and my family during this time.   After an hour and forty five minute wait we finally got seated.  I did not want to leave at that point but I will never go back because of them.  The waitress was very nice and got a 20% tip but it's frustrating knowing that those hostesses will get a percentage of that.  They need better people skills and definitely how to have efficient customer service.  The food was great just not an adequate representation of their service.   Maria",

We ordered the no.1, no.8, no.10 and I a no.3. The waffles were good but the chicken was soggy not even crispy, i guess I'm use to the crispy chicken from Roscoes they really set the bar high.  Drinks were good and also the menu has a lot of cool funny names for their food.  Overall an ok experience",

It's an interesting place.  Both of us had different versions of their chicken & waffles.  It was very loud in the restaurant, and we had trouble understanding our waitress who took our drink and food order.  Waited through two cups of coffee for our food.  The food was OK. Just OK.  Nothing really special in my opinion.  I was expecting something better.  Trying to have a conversation with my date was very difficult because it was so loud in the place.  Glad they had flavored creamers for our coffee, though.  I wish I could have had their Banana Pudding. It looked delicious.  If I come back, I'll be sure to bring my earplugs.  Did I mention that it was loud here?",

So as you can imagine, I was beyond excited to find a chicken and waffle joint in Phoenix that easily compares to Roscoes. In fact, I'm not sure I could tell you who's better at this point.   I always order the Betty Boop. Great waffle. Good chicken (make sure you try maple syrup on the chicken...weird but delicious).   Random note, Love the building remodel. Once you enter the building you almost forget what part of town you're in. In fact, my sister loves the ladies room. She believes the lighting in there makes her look like a rockstar and gives her an instant boost to her self esteem. So go ahead and order that side of cheese grits swimming in butter...just be sure to visit the ladies room on your way out and leave feeling like a million bucks!!!",

I ordered 2 thighs and a waffle, and my daughter had 2 wings with a waffle. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the waffle was light and fluffy with a great touch of cinnamon. I didn't think I was gonna finish the whole meal (cause I wanted to bring some home) but the task was too easy. If you like really SWEET tea , this is the place to get it. Mine was a bit too sweet for my liking (thats why they only get 4stars, because of the iced tea).  Overall if you never been here, you gotta go. At least once, then twice, then three times.....",

I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.  We walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to \"scoot\"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said \"it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you\". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.  Our waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says \"UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin\".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the \"complicated\" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in \"ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others\". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager/Waiter/Host/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned.   I don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again.",

    "text": "Ok, so I've been using Yelp for quite some time, and this is the first time I've been so disappointed I had to take the time to write a review.   8.50$ for a Bacon Bloody Mary.. Vodca, tomato juice with a piece of bacon in it.  4$ for a side of home fries (that weren't even cooked all the way).  15$ for a 3 piece two waffles and 2 eggs... Over Medium eggs ordered, sunny up came out. Also chicken was extremely bland... Popeye's Chicken is better and cheaper.  3.50$ for a mason jar of cool aid.   20$ for appetizer sampler.. Pickle chips sooo deep fried couldn't taste the pickles, and breading on fried green tomatoes was VERY bland.  15$ shrimp Mac and cheese.. So salty was barely edible and the shrimp was rubbery.   Complained to waitress (when flagged her down, she didn't even check up on us for over 40 minutes) she provides us with 4 coupons for \"free cool aid\"... As long as minimum purchase and day and time restrictions are met with purchase and says \" best I can do\". We also mentioned that the food used to be so much better before the location was torn down and rebuilt to which she replied \"I don't know why so many people say that.. I think the chicken is good\"  My SO'S Purple sourous Rex (spelling?) was good.  All said and done over 80$ for 2 people for dinner. I expect a LOT better for that price. I will not be back.",

The chicken is some of the best around and waffles are some of the best you'll ever have. The ambiance is really cool as well. The staff is always very friendly and the place is always clean.  My only complaints is $15 is a little pricey for a plate of chicken and waffles. Also it's always so busy you don't really get the service that they I think they are trying to give you. Another thing is they have a manager or owner or something that just kind of stands in the back with his arms crossed just staring at everybody.... no smile nothing just very uncomfortable.... All things considered I really do love this place and I will continue to go back.",

Once seated, I received service immediately and my waitress was great. When I received my food, my waffle was not even warm enough to melt the butter that I spread on it. My chicken looked really old and greasy and had a dark brown color to it. My grits were completely undercooked and hard... The waitress informed me that my chicken looked normal to her but that she would replace my entire meal. When I received my new plate, the waffle was a little warmer but the chicken taste really old and the grits were still hard.... I will stick to Roscoes in LA Lo-Lo's... Fresh food is the best way to keep a customer happy. Good luck",

I always had to visit Roscoe's without fail. For some reason I had no idea this place existed for the longest.   I seem to remember Lo-Lo's having a pretty good sized menu but it never matters. If it only had one thing on the menu that would be good enough for me!   I still have yet to go to the one in Scottsdale even though I'm walking distance from it, but the downtown Phx location just seems so authentic. One of these days when I have an extra $20 in my wallet I'll bike over to their Scottsdale spot and see if it matches up.   Either way, if enough reviews haven't persuaded you yet to be adventurous and try this awesome mix of food, you should stop using Yelp because you're doing it wrong.    Protip: Get it smothered. Your getting enough food to give yourself a heart attack already, why not add some gravy and onions. You'll thank me later!",

After inquiring about it with several totally clueless employees, I'm finally told by an equally clueless manager that there's two prices yo.....one for 16oz and one for 22oz.  That's right yoyo...........$7.00 fucking dollars for my 16oz Blue Moon on tap.  Reminds me of a good old ass fucking, like the one provided at that soul food joynt I ate at a long time ago in San Jose.  You get my drift?  You know what I'm sayin???  I expected straight up service with straight up prices and I received neither.  All good.  All good indeed.  Just another lesson learned amidst all the chicken and waffles hype in this skid row hood.  I'm glad I tried it but I'd never go back.   Roscoe's in SoCal is still the big daddy of them all, if you be craycraving chicken and waffles..",

    "text": "And here from la to see what the hype was all about.  First thing when I came in for a party of two the lady said ok I'll put your name on the list and as I'm still standing there, another hostess walks up and ask the guy behind me how many in his party and seated him right away. I asked why did the guy with a party of 3 get a seat and she replies that his name was on the list...this was False because the other hostess had no paper to look at and he asked how many not calling out his name to check in...I questioned it and moved on being that it wasn't packed out   My waitress however turned my experience around for me... she was very pleasant and knowledgeable about what she liked and didn't like.   I ordered the famous soul-food platter. 3 piece of chicken smothered in gravy and onions with mac, yams and cornbread.  The food is ok...definitely hyped a little much but it's not bad. The huge jar of koolaid was great (might be too sweet for some) the cobbler is ok as well...  Whenever I'm in AZ I'll try to visit and try out different things  Also my cousin let me taste her waffle and it's pretty good, similar to roscoes waffles",

Chicken was just as delicious. I wish I had gotten the Kool-Aid. My mistake there. The atmosphere is super chill. Everyone we encountered during our visit was pleasant and the service excellent. Our server Lynette was awesome and took care of us quickly and the utmost professionalism. Excellent all the way around. I was born and raised in LA. There is a famous place out there we used to hit before going to Kings, Lakers, Dodger games. Now that I am in Arizona, I will definitely be making Lo-Lo's my stop before I hit Suns & D-Backs games. Fantastic place! Glad we found it!",

    "text": "After traversing appx 1,500 miles in a couple days, we were famished...  What else can fill a couple fatasses better than fried chicken, waffles, soda, and kool aid on warm Friday morning at bout 11am.  Yep... Ventured to Arizona's version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and they did not disappoint.  Why Roscoes? Because i love their food. THe waffle is thick, with flavor rather than the crunchy thin crusts that many folks adhere too. There will much comparison to Roscoe because the other chicken and waffle places like Mrs. Bea's kinda suck...  Service: Stephen was our host and server, and he was great. One of the best servers my limited life has the privilege of experiencing. He was on top of everything, constantly asking if we needed stuff. Keep in mind, it was super hectic at this hour and he just hustled. It got to a point where I can't even ask for anything because he asked first or was bringing it out... At the end of the day, he shaked our hands, and thanked us, and wished us a wonderful time in the 602. I was amazed how excellent the service was. Of course, with the exception to the skinny waiter/host at Roscoes LBC, the service tends to suck pretty bad.  Chicken: It tasted similar to Roscoe, even the menu had similar attributes. Nice and fluffy.   Lolo's Hot sauce: Pretty damn good. Had a nice cajun bite opposed to Tabasco's vinegarette base or the pepperish mexican chiles.   Waffle: Decent flavor but not as thick. I didn't particularly care for the waffles too much.  Kool Aid: LOL sugar and water, what can go wrong? THis day, they had red, blue, and green. Obviously, i indudged in the OG red. Upon asking to try the green, Stephen, asked if I have tried the Suicide.   Suicide: Bottom was lemonade with blue, green, and red kool aid topped off with sprite. No Mixing!!!! and it was great... Perfect thirst quencher for the Arijona heat...  Overall I was pleased with the overall experience, from the courteous valet dude(s) all the way to the kool aid and bill.   So far, my time in Arizona was met amazing friendliness. I was a bit concerned with the various news media on hobunk Arizona towns and their disdain for minorities portrayed by all types of media. That shit is so unTrue. I love these little country/hicktowns =D  All the country white folks in Arijona, from Buckeye all the way down to whack ass Bisbee was nothing but pleasantry, howdy y'll, smiles, and excellent hospitality.   Lolo's and Cracker Barrel. I have never experienced such wonderful hospitality.  Funny thing is, both places are completely different cultures, but still very pleasant to patronize.",

    "text": "Meh.... it was okay. Definitely didn't live up to the hype that it receives.   I had a group of 6 that went for an early afternoon meal and seating took quite a while. It wasn't necessarily the wait itself that bothered us, but we kept getting told that our seat was almost ready even though it was never almost ready.  I finally asked to talk to a manager and we were seated quickly.   The waitress was very nice, but the food wasn't really anything special at all. A family member sent an order back because it just didn't taste right, and I wasn't impressed with the chicken and waffles meal. Certainly an okay place to grab a bite, but I wouldn't wait for a seat that long again",

It was oh so bad for you, but oh so tasty...and good every once in a while (like maybe only once a year).  Love that they update the wait on Yelp, so you know what you're getting into.

She picked us up as her table when no one wanted us. The manager also gave a discount on the food for not being helped the first time. The Al Madin was delicious and Lo-Lo chicken and waffles was good as well. I was going to rate this 2.5 for service, but they earned their stars back. Food was good.

We had our order as take out, the first girl we encountered had to get another to take our order, guessing order taking was out of the hostesses capabilities. Paid at 5:20pm, left by 5:35pm.  We both ordered chorizo and eggs, sadly only one of us will be eating. It wasn't terribly loud in the place, we repeated our order twice. Obviously taking meal orders is not the second gals job either. However, we did receive utensils for two people.  As far as the staff goes, it seems they are more interested in their 'gossip' than their patrons.  The food may well be amazing, but the staff ruined what could have been a very good meal, had we gotten it.  Not a place we will recommend, nor will we return to.",

(Note:  despite the Yelp map showing it on the E side of Central, Lo-Lo's is actually West of Central two doors on the North side of Yuma).  The sign is small so keep your eyes open.  Walk in and the waiting area has several nice pieces of art displayed as well as a book section where you can enjoy a quick read in kind of a coffee house atmosphere.  If you have time.  The guy and the girl who were working staff were quick, polite, helpful and cheery.  We were seated right away.  Service was prompt and lightening fast, but I went before the noon rush with only 4 other parties when we arrived and 3 more that came along after us.  So I imagine it changes, YMMV  I had the Lil' Amadi combo opting for two thighs and a waffle plus a large Sweet Tea.  Chicken was great, flavorful and juicy but not too salty and the waffles crispy and tasty - cooked just right.  The Massive Kern mason jar of sweet tea was never empty thanks to prompt staff workers.   Total of mine came in at $10.38, then I tipped 20%.  Fair fare price - LOL!   Photos attached  YELPERS: This Place is another one of the gems I might never have found without browsing the selections on Yelp.    Thanx Yelp for keeping it fresh.",

And it was everything so good that this was something for me to base my decision on moving from NY where we have some of the top soul food restaurants where the owners (yes Gladys, LL Cool J ) and other famous people would stop through to say \"what's up\" ok so 3yrs later I moved here. Revised LoLos to fins it nothing like the first time around. Then my husband and I checked out the one in Scottsdale, the food was good but the Greeter was very nasty. I guess because the way my husband and I were dressed they thought we were bums. Okay so today I decided to revisit  the Central Ave location and it Sucked, I wish I can show you the pic the only fresh on my was the chicken wing, the corn bread was dried out and overcooked,  the breast looked like it was cooked in old grease, and the breast looked old. The sides were okay but this is just the reason why I would never return.  The worst food ever!!!##",

The waffles were good but they were basically pancakes with waffle imprints, not crispy at all like the menu stated. The prices are way to ridiculous for \"hood\" food as they call it. And for a place that claims to serve soul food, there was only one catfish item on the menu, a tiny sandwich. Not worth the trip. The biscuits were ok, but tasted like the flour wasnt sifted well snd I got a couple of clumps of dried dough in mine.",

I ordered the Famous Soul Food Platter w/ 3 pieces of chicken, a cornbread muffin, mac & cheese, a waffle and some of that good ol' lemonade.  My mom got the Toy-Toy (I think that's 2 wings and a waffle) and some grape Kool-Aid.  We expected to wait a while for our food, but it was on the table in no time.  Our chicken was hot, crispy and juicy, even better w/ that hot sauce.  The mac was good, cheesy and not cooked to death (which I really appreciated).  That corn muffin was tasty and the waffles... they were just BOMB.  I rolled up a piece of chicken in it and that really set it off.  Even with all those people in there, the staff didn't even seem stressed.  They checked on us and made sure we were taken care of.  Everybody was all smiles the whole time and our server gave us a \"God bless\" on the receipt.  Nice touch!  I'll be back.  You better believe I WILL be back.",

We got the chicken and waffles because I believe if the place is known for their chicken and waffles then just go with it. We were not disappointed... The chicken was crisp, moist, and delicious. The waffle was thick and soft with just a hint of nutmeg. We also tried the Caramel Banana Pecan Pancakes and I have to say these were the highlight of the meal so tasty and the caramel maple syrup they pour over them Is to die for.. I wish they sold it to go.. All in all expect to wait to be seated but then enjoy being treated like family.. Lo Lo's we will be back!!",

    "text": "At first I was excited to be here but after the waitress came back and told me that they mistakenly put the wrong order in and asked me if I wanted this OR the original order I had placed. I told her that I wanted the original order I had placed. Well they brought everything out for the table. I was the only one stuck watching other people eat. This kinda sucked because I was starving! They had served me the sides that come with the order and by the time they were almost gone I finally got my main course. It was the catfish served plain on a plate! There was no seasoning, the batter was tasteless, and I must say the food overall was pretty damn weak!   The drinks we ordered were Kool-Aid thinking how cool would it be to get something that harkens back to childhood. Strangely this stuff burned my tongue because it wasn't mixed right. So I asked for a Bloody mary. The bloody mary came to me in what looked like an 8oz serving for a whopping $8.50!!!! This is ridiculous, its pre made mix with a piece of bacon in it! Nothing Special!  All in all this sucks as we only went here because when polled online, a lot of people said that we should go here! All in all the service sucked, and the food was super sub par. The catfish was served battered with no condiments, not even lemon wedges to squeeze onto it to make it taste better! Needless to say I took the stuff home and dressed it like it shoulda been and it was good. So if you are in the market to buy expensive catfish to take home and \" Recook\" then this is a good bet, but most want the experience as is! In this case good luck!",

This was our first time visiting and we were impressed. Even though the place was busy it was very enjoyable. Food was served quick, hot & fresh! Will definitely be returning and recommending to family & friends. The only thing I wish there was, would be a kids menu but the staff was helpful on pointing out which items were a good pick for young children.  Thanks again Lolos Chicken and Waffles!",

Didn't want it to get cold before I got home. Anyways. I ordered the boob(A breast and a waffle) and a side of mac n cheese as well as a to go fruit punch kool aid. I'm not sure why but she gave me the drink free. I think she was having issues with the register. She said it would be a 30 min wait. I thought that was long for only a handful of tables. So I took a seat and waited. It came out in 12 mins. So I went out side and ate it in my car. The chicken had really good flavors and was juicy. But it was a bit too salty. I'm not sensitive to salt and that was too much for me. The waffle taste like a waffle. It had a bit of cinnamon which I liked. But the waffle had no crunch at all. It came completely soft. I was looking forward to the crunch. That's why I ate it there and didn't wait to get it home. The Mac n cheese was good. Not great. It wasn't as creamy as I thought or wanted it to be. It was kind of thick. The kool aid tasted bad. I was looking forward to it too. It tast like the artificial sweetner mixed with those little squeeze flavor things that you put in water. Over all it wasn't that bad. I want to give it one more try. Maybe it was an off day.",

The staff was horrible and rude when it came to everything from being the hostess down to waiting on tables. No one seemed interested in thier paying jobs or cared what thier customers needs were. We waited over 45 minutes to get a table simply because the staff failed to keep up with busing tables and cleaning them off in a timely manner when other patrons left. After that, it took 15 minutes just to get our waitress to pay attention to us only for her to leave half way through our service, never to return. An hour after ordering our food, it arrived with a completely different waitress who was able to salvage what was left of our good time. And did I mention there were flies, most likely due to the slow clean up skills from the staff. I wish I could blame being busy as to why we were treated so poorly but a good chunk of the tables were empty. All that was left on them were the previous cutomers meals that still had not been cleaned up. Finally, we were informed that senior and military discounts are only applicable Monday through Thursday",

I got one small leg and then a giant breast the size of a football. How they fried that sucker to be fully cooked is a mystery. The waffles are like Eggos. Nothing mind blowing. Maybe we've been spoiled with our homemade Belgian waffles.  The staff, including the manager was super friendly but everything in this restaurant was just so friggin slow, not to mention the ridiculous wait on a Monday night.  Overhyped.

Came with a party of 6 for Sunday morning brunch. We had an hour wait which surprisingly was a little bit faster then quoted  which was great. I got the chicken breast and waffle and a side of Mac and cheese which Is generally my usual at Roscoe's. The waffle was thin and smelled fresh and yummy. The chicken was in the small side which is fine for me seeing as I still had a whole waffle and Mac and cheese. When I tasted the chicken it was extremely dry. My sister's chicken wasn't as dry as mine, but still I was a little disappointed. With each bite I took I was in need of a beverage to wash it down with. Unfortunately, I got sweet tea and that was hands down the most disgusting sweet tea of my life! The saying \"Would you like some Tea with that Sugar\" comes to mind. I had to dilute it with water and even then I couldn't drink the pure sugar... We get it, you serve over sugared homemade drinks... But seriously, You're better off getting water or soda which both options contain less sugar then their sweet tea or kool-aid. Anyway, When they initially brought out our food they didn't bring out my side, I asked the waiter about the Mac and he apologized and said it would be out right away. A few minutes later he asked if I ever got it and said he would get it himself; in which he did and was super apologetic about it. He was a sweet guy. The Mac and cheese was plain, it tastes doughy to me, almost bland. The waffle was okay, I put light syrup and ate it, I don't have much to rave about for it was just a regular waffle... I still prefer a Waffle House waffle or Roscoe's...  My cousin got chicken smothered in gravy, I tasted the gravy and it was pure amazingness! I instantly wished I would have ordered it. The gravy tastes like bell peppers and other spices, very yummy!  My other family members ordered the chorizo plate which was a big serving alongside tortillas which everyone tasted and loved. Also, another family member got the biscuits and gravy. Another must, the serving size was big and the biscuits were on point!   Parking is. Pain, they have a small lot but you can park a block away in the neighborhood. The location inside is clean and decorated very nice and authentic looking. I've read other reviews and hears the service sucks, so I guess we got lucky And got some great help.   Do I recommend it? Meh, I would say sure Go it if you want to try it out. Specifically my food was not that good but from everyone else's food I tried it was good, and I personally would come back only to try their other dinner options...  For chicken and waffles I'll stick to my local Roscoe's.",

    "text": "I was visiting Phoenix for the first time and Yelped what seemed to be the best place to eat.  Lo-Lo's popped up towards the top of the list.  I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated.   While I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.    The place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).  I'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.  Food came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.    Overall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better.",

My second confession is that last Saturday was the first time I indulged in CW and it was on vacation, at Lolo's. Holy banana pants!!! I have been missing out!  The chicken was fresh, hot, crispy, tender - the batter is epic. And the waffle was thin, crunch crunch, almost with a hint of cinnamon, bathed in butter and syrup -- oh-hohoho! LOVE.   The missing star is due to the macaroni and cheese, disastrous velvety glop. Meh.",

I picked up Jenny from the airport and, after a brief discussion about the local restaurants Sky Harbor was incorporating into their terminal renovations, we decided it was the perfect opportunity to give Lo-Lo's a try. We have another soul food restaurant near us (Off Da Hook) but Lo Lo's is like 'the' soul food in the valley so we had to give it a run.   Our server, though a bit slow with service, was extremely friendly and really the highlight of the visit (next to the Kool Aid -- oh yeah!) but neither the food nor the prices knocked our socks off. It was all good but nothing to write home about. Maybe I need to try more than just the chicken, waffles, and mac n cheese next time.",

Great portion sizes, perfectly fried chicken and homey waffles were all wonderful.  The grits were amazing - as good as I've had in the south - so cheesy and creamy.  I'd highly recommend any of their locations.",

The big pain about this location last time was the parking, but it got better because there is a lot of self parking spots and they even have a complimentary valet service!   I chose to valet the car of course. Too lazy to walk, lol. It was steady and busy for a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes. Walking in though it was like a whole new atmosphere. The place was bigger than last time I seen it, so there was ample room. We got seated in the booth. I forgot who was our waiter, shame on me, but they were very pleasant and nice. We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.  Waffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more. Finished off all of the chicken, some of the gravy even made its way onto the waffles, but that didn't even matter because whatever was on that plate was just the right kind of balance of sweet and saltiness together. It definitely made my Sunday! OVERALL, with the new look and excellent staff, I enjoyed every minute of it. I think its nice that it was a valet for its customers because of how parking is in Phoenix. Their staff is amazing. Very courteous, polite, and exceptional. The food, BEYOND AMAZING and I will make sure I come back.. maybe even this Sunday again!",

So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him \"What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!\" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said \"NOTHING!!\"  I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me \"you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation.\"   This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.    Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!  The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets.   The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry.   It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it.   This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING.   I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices.",

The wait time to get into the restaurant was reasonable and they do offer a nice outside lounge to wait at but it went downhill from there.   Our table of five was placed in the COOP room. The acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud. The surfaces are all hard, the sound of the metal chairs scratching against the concrete reminds one of nails on chalkboard, but that's ok. It's part of the vibe. The AC was icy though, perhaps because we were under the vent. Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.  We mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it.   The taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait.   I'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology. It's always better to tell the truth and say we're sorry we forgot to make an item on your ticket than to claim something like shrimp and grits takes 45 minutes to prepare.",

I kindly asked this man, who may have been the manager, to turn please turn down the TV volume.  Immediately he told me \"take your phone and go outside\".  I said it had nothing to do with my phone, and that he had quite an attitude towards a customer. He then continued to tell me why he was NOT going to turn it down.    I cannot and will not support a business that treats it's paying customer with such disrespect.  He obviously has some chip on his shoulder.  Not to mention that the food is grossly over priced now that they are a franchise type entity.  $12 for a ham omelette.  I can go to the 5nDiner and get better food and better service at a cheaper price.",

First our server forgot about us so we were sitting for 30 min with no service on top of the 1 1/2 hrs that we had to wait to get a table. Our water was never refilled and when we paid she kept the change assuming it was her tip (when it wasn't bc tip was already included). For those reasons we will never be back at this establishment. There are many other places we can go for some chicken waffles",

Not my all-time favorite catfish, but good!  Service was great, food was good, and my mom loved that they serve sweetened tea (she's from Nebraska, where this is a foreign concept).

We stopped Coming BECAUSE the service became so $hitty, but they have redeemed themselves tonight. Bianca was on point with our order and the manager was attentive and polite when checking on us. The Mac and cheese must have gone they some type of revival recipe because it's better than the last time I remember ordering it. Should have ordered the greens to see if the flavor has improved too. Husband had the toy toy & I had the Betty boop. Both were cooked perfectly and our plates reflected our satisfaction as we didn't need a to-go box since there wasn't anything to take home. I did notice that the waffle size has changed in size - it's a lot smaller and thinner but still tasty. We just make come back again!",

    "text": "Approaching the hostess stand as I looked around the newly designed space I was quick to find that much like my surroundings the service too at Lo Lo's was far superior to Roscoe's and led by one smiling face at the podium to another at my table towards the back it would not be long before a menu was in hand, water was filled, and a few daily specials were noted - the whole process taking less than five minutes and my order placed within ten, much to my waiter's delight as he noted \"man, you ordered all the best stuff - I hope you brought your appetite.\"  Sitting and watching the games as the restaurant's hustle and bustle continued my neighbors struck up a conversation with me stating that they had been coming to Lo-Lo's \"every few weeks since the day it opened\" and admitting it was my first time they suggested it definitely wouldn't be my last and within moments of the arrival of my meal I knew they were right as every single item that landed on my table looked excellent; the first being a single $3.50 \"Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquette\" featuring a crispy external batter surrounding flaky salmon and studded with green onions.  Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.  Moving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.  Making short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.  Beginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.  Realizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.",

We went to lunch and were meeting somebody there. We were told we can't be seated until the entire party is there and we had to wait. The third person from our party showed up 5 mins later and we were seated at a table that was empty the entire time we waited. I'm sure there's a reason for this policy but I have never experienced that in a restaurant - everywhere else you can sit down and start ordering, even if there are more people that will come join afterwards",

    "text": "This review is for the Phoenix location only. As a person of color who has eaten in a variety of soul food restaurants over the past 35+ years, I feel right at home here. Maurice and his staff at the Phoenix location take excellent care of their customers and regulars.   I always have the same thing: The lil' Amati; I have for years. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles are always hot. For add ons I will get the cornbread muffin and the mac n' cheese.   My husband has tried a variety of dishes: the chicken sandwich, fried zucchini, the steak and egg breakfast, and the salads; he has also had some variation of the chicken and waffles. His favorite is the salad because the chicken is good and he isn't straying too far from his eating plan.   I love the atmosphere and the food.   I have read a few reviews from white people complaining about the service at the Phoenix location. I feel like I need to preface what I am about to write: I am not calling anyone a racist or a bigot. I am not one, either. Lolo's tries really hard to meet the needs of its (suddenly) diverse customer base. It will not always hit the mark. If you like the food but are leery about being treated differently because of your perceived ethnicity I have a suggestion: try their Gilbert or Scottsdale locations. Those locations are gentrified versions of this wonderful minority owned eating establishment. Perhaps gentrified is a harsh word. My caucasian husband who grew up on Chicago's south side says, \"White washed.\" Ok, that's harsh! However, the non-Phoenix locations are designed and run to appeal to the markets they serve as determined by their geographic location. It is likely people who don't feel comfortable eating on the south side will enjoy the food and the ambiance in Scottsdale or Gilbert.   The food is uniform at all locations and it is still very delicious.",

People looked at me and it was apparent that I had a look of I needed something, but to no avail.  When I asked to see the manager, that took several minutes.  He offered us free dessert, but I didn't bother ordering any.  The service was once we ordered was poor as well.  My buddy and I would go to the one in Scottsdale and it was always a great experience, so I was I excited to bring my wife to the LoLos's experience.  When I asked her what she thought afterwards, she said KFC tasted better.",

    "text": "After moving to AZ,  I noticed Lo-Lo's when I would drive around, so one night a friend and I decided to check it out, and we ended up loving our experience there. We arrived for dinner, and we were immediately greeted by a super friendly and chill waiter named AJ. He told us what people usually order and even if a dish would be too big to consume in one sitting.  My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and eggs. The pieces of chicken were super crunchy. The biscuits were ginormous - I think one is the size of my fist. Lo-Lo's also has kool-aid on tap, which is amazing. I hadn't drank kool-aid since I was maybe in elementary school and consequently had forgotten how deliciously sweet and addicting it is.  The portions are huge for the money you pay, the decor is fun and bright and clean, and the service is great. I am definitely coming back. very soon.",

Service was great and Monique our server we could have taken her home with us.  She made the visit a Delight.  The catfish beignets I laugh at the name because of the New Orleans reference is just catfish strips but they were darn good.  Drinks are pretty nice, served in mason jars. I think because we came right before closing that the food was missing something or rushed and wasn't better than our first visit but I'll come back",

My boss ordered a Betty Boop as well, and his wife ordered biscuits and gravy. We were served our drinks in large mason jars. I ordered Pepsi, and my boss ordered... Wait for it... Red Kool Aid!!! I thought that was awesome! So southern! The food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and it looked mouthwatering. The chicken was fried just right, and the waffle was so good! Next time I want to try the biscuits and gravy... If I ever come back to Phoenix in the near future. We also had a side of green beans, and they were delicious. They had a southern Cajun kick to them, but it was so tasty. Not too spicy. Prices are good, not too expensive and the food portions are fulfilling! I left here satisfied!",

Just as you are reading this comment, I had done the same, wondering why in the world did this place get all of these high ratings?  What could it be that I am missing in the world of fried chicken and waffles?!  Naturally, my inclination to satisfy my hunger and curiosity brought me to the restaurant!  Came in right before the lunch crowd at noon and service was quick.   Ordered fried chicken & waffles, 2 pieces+Mac & cheese , another 2 pieces + waffle.  A lot I know!  My head was bigger than my stomach because I was hungry!    The waffles' flavor = Superb.   Fried chicken = Amazing!  Combining waffles + chicken? = Supmazing! Errrhmmm   So if you're a fried chicken fan, come on down, if you're a waffle fan come on down... and if you're a fried chicken and waffles fan?  Holy mac...Don't come down...you better hop and fly down!   Haha I was in the mood for some fried chicken and enjoyed my meal, hope you do too!",

Jackson?) gets a very skinny time-gone-by Chris Tucker in the trunk of that dirty ass car by the promise of, and I just guessing here, \"Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles\"...and since that time I've meant to go to Lo-Lo's.  And I just never made it until now.  When I saw a gorgeous fried chicken breast from Lo-Lo's at a D-backs game, but at $8, and that's no misprint, that's EIGHT DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE CHICKEN BREAST, I thought, well, now it's time to go to Lo-Lo's because I do want to try it but not at $8.  1/2 that outside the ballyard.   This week, June 2015, I got down there and I know 3 things to be True:  *1:  Really, really good chicken breast. I got a #8: one breast, waffle, $8.  One breast on the side, +$4.  Moist, very juicy. see photos.  Very, very good.  *2:  Mac & Cheese is crazy good.  I will never again eat Kraft; it was only passable to ghetin with but now I'm spoiled, absolutely delicious.  $4, a small portion, I'm guessing 4oz, so good it doesn't matter the size.  Very, very good.   3:  $7 FOR A 10 OZ BEER IN A 12 OZ GLASS IS JUST...unexpected. TOO MUCH!  CRIMINAL.  NFW!  You can make the case that I should have looked at the menu.  But here in America, we come to expect certian things. and a $7, 12 oz beer that really was poured so much earlier, the head had disappeared and it was really 11oz, not that cold, SEVEN FRICKING DOLLARS! for a draft beer is out-friggin'-rageous!!!!  I'd go back but I'll stop at Hazelwoods for a good, cold beer, priced like we expect it to, then I'll go eat the chicken.    Go, enjoy, just don't get the $7 beers.",

Even if something goes wrong with an order, they make up for it. Hey, nobody is perfect and they handle mistakes with class and to my complete satisfaction. I have been to the Central Ave location once but my favorite one is in Gilbert. I truly appreciate the quality service. It doesn't feel fake or forced but quite genuine. They make me feel truly welcome. And, they play Gospel music on Sunday!! This is my go-to when I have guests in town and they never fail to make the trip worth it!

We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.  Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a \"jar of drank,\" Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.  My boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!  I went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.  The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona.",

After hearing all the rave about Chicken and Waffles I was very excited to try this with my family. We had never been to or tried LoLos. We were so excited to try it. Today was the day. Saturday August 20, 2016. We walked in the front door to the front desk. The girl standing there saw us walk in and disappeared. She just left and we were standing there.   We stood there for about 8 mins. And numerous staff saw us. There were a few older people standing talking to others in the restaurant. Two younger black men walked in behind us and we're just chatting while we were standing there. Again no one acknowledged us....6 min. We stood there another 2 minutes. 8 mins we finally turned around and left.   Antwayn Jones and Berlan who were the Manager and General Manager, you should all be ashamed of yourselves to allow your staff member to treat paying customers this way. I certainly don't want to bring race into this but we can't help but wonder if this was because of all the racial tension. Needless to say, whatever reason it was you lost 5 customers and don't worry. We will tell our friends and family about this visit and they will tell two friends and so on.   Love,  Karma",

Being from Los Angeles, we often went to Roscoe's... so when we got the craving for chicken & waffles, I was excited to see a reputable place was out here in the valley. I was definitely NOT disappointed. The chicken was fantastic, as was the waffles!  The chicken tenders were not nearly as good as the regular fried chicken, but they too were still good. Additionally, the cornbread muffins were large and quite delicious. I am absolutely thrilled to know this place here, we will be coming back often, that's for sure! Its also good to know they have multiple locations, making it easier when in other areas. If you are in the area and craving some delicious food, so in and check it out. Great food and a friendly staff!",

    "text": "We were stopping over from TX on our way back to Las Vegas. I had bookmarked this place even before we had left for TX, so I made it clear that when we head back after our trip...we would come here to eat.  We did that.  It was really easy to find. Pulling in I could see there were people waiting outside for their turn at some Lolos. We didn't get deterred because it didn't look that bad of a wait. Entering the restaurant...it was packing in there! It was a Sunday afternoon around 1 something, and it was filled! Anyway, we were told twas going to be a 45 minute wait. Initially, I thought crap...only because we had been driving since El Paso and there were hungry lions to be fed. THANKFULLY, we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes. Apparently, most the folks waiting ahead of us lost patience and left. Welp, yay for us. Hallelujuer. Think we waited for about 20minutes.  We get seated and was not immediately greeted by a waiter/tress. But, I didn't mind because we were trying to tame these wild animals into their seats all while trying to stare at the menu (which btw we were already staring at the to-go menus they had available as we were waiting to be seated). I'd say 5 minutes later our waitress comes by and tells us she'll be right with us as she has dirty plates in tow.   She comes back, we order immediately. Hungry and on a time battle here. I ordered the toy-toy. 2 wings and a waffle. The boys ordered their chicken tenders that come with cornbread, and the husband orders 3pc chicken with waffles.   Dining out I am not one to order fried chicken. Mainly because I've tried chicken that isn't home cooked and they've all tasted nasty. Like, well cooked on the outside...still soggy from the batter on the inside, salty, peppery, lack of meat, oily, etc...so ordering the 2 wings was ideal for me because incase I did not like the chicken...it wouldn't be much chicken to eat, thus, wouldn't be much chicken to go to waste.  Never fails, the 1 time I'm being cautious is the 1 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.im&s=6faf3c6871633b53fd2bb6ed3787f0063fc99461ea2ba10342eedf8b61cf92b1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">time.im</a> thinking, damnt! Their chicken was NOT dry. It was moist, seasoned properly, and just cooked almost perfectly. I say almost because I like my wings to be extra crispy. But for someone who doesn't order chicken dining out, it was close to perfect. The waffle was nice and soft with crisp edges.   Tried my boys tenders and those things were fat and moist as well! The cornbread, however, which comes with their plate was overcooked. You could tell it was just by looking at it. It looked like it was 5 minutes away from becoming burnt. I love cornbread. However, I didn't love cornbread on this day.   Also, the fries that came with my boys' plates...I felt were way too seasoned. I had to dust off the seasoning just so my toddler can enjoy it properly. It just became way too salty after each fry.   In conclusion, it's a chicken and waffle joint. Their chicken and waffle did not disappoint at all! They do have LOTS of other items on their menu if chicken and waffles aren't your fancy. I can see where people may feel they are pricey in some parts of their menu, but from my quick experience...it's worthed. I really wish we had more time so I could explore their other items, but we will save that for another trip. We had a nice experience, despite the children going wild. Lol. Will DEFINITELY return and will definitely put my stamp of recommendation.",

I'm white, I'm not racist but he was, when I finally got up and asked to get a table because he wouldn't serve me, he later walked past me with a huge grin on his face like he'd won some kind of contest.  The place was half black people, the staff half white half black but this bartender hates waiting on white people and clearly made it an awful experience.  It was aggressive and really weird, I'm intimidated to ever go back in there, he's super angry at a total stranger.  He should be fired for racism.",

It's a small price to pay, and let's be honest, Lo-Lo's is insanely crowded most of the time, so the servers have a lot on their plate, so to speak. I'll cut them some slack.  I had a melon mojito, which was delicious. Just heavenly. I couldn't taste much alcohol in it, but it tasted so good, I didn't care. That's quite a statement to make, especially considering their mojitos cost $6 each. But honestly, it was enchanting. I can't wait to try more of their drinks.  We were a party of three, we were served separately and in pieces... first, one of my friends got his food, then about 5 minutes later, I got a side of my meal, and then another 5 minutes later, I got the rest of my meal, but it took an additional 15 minutes for them to come out with my boyfriend's food. That's excessive. But then again, the food was so delicious, we didn't really care, and neither should you.   Once the food arrived, it was incredibly delicious. Any annoyance about our service was immediately wiped clean from my consciousness with the first bite of heavenly fried chicken. Ultimately, we come here for the food and drink, right? Lo-Lo's hit it out of the park in that area.   The environment was fun and welcoming, too. There is a DJ that plays in the back. There are couches outside for when you're overcome with the itis after your meal.   There were a few other minor complaints I had about the service, but they were minor, and easily forgotten with the delicious food and drink and fun environment. In sum, come here to enjoy yourself and enjoy some good food, and know your servers are working hard to bring you the best, so chill out and wait patiently.",

    "text": "I need to let you all know that ever since the expansion and more so the franchise Lo Lo's has been going down hill! I am very disappointed in several things concerning this location. Here we go with my list; yes list of complaints. I hope your paying attention Larry....  1. I think there is a lack of management. I say this because employee's are running amuck. The past 4 yes, 4 visits we have experience rude hostesses that were more concerned with their plans for the upcoming weekend or the poor performance of their fellow employees than helping the customers that pay their salaries. The last time we were in the hostess outright LIED to our faces and told us she had no booth's available. When were sat at a table; we saw the one in the front was empty it just hadn't been cleared of dishes that had been there for awhile. (I say awhile because no one left the building once we arrived and we waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to show up to greet us, then another 10 minutes to be sat even though the restaurant wasn't even a 4th full) and when I went up to ask for that booth. We were told that the couple that walked in behind us had requested it.   2. The service has gotten slower with every visit and we have been going at different times. Visit 1 of 4 on a Tuesday around 2:20pm we waited 35 minutes for an Omlette, 2 salmon croquettes, greens and mac n cheese. We took home a sock it to me cake and a banana pudding. The sock it to me cake was so dry it was not edible! By far the worst cake outside of the Red Velvet I got some years back that they had made using the cornbread mix by mistake UGH.   Visit 2 of 4 on a Thursday around 8pm, place was not busy at all. We waited an hour and 10 minutes for 2 Toy Toy's, a Trey Trey, a Big ass samich and a 3 piece white with mac n cheese and greens. In addition no apology for the wait nothing and one of the Toy Toy's was ICE cold!   Visit 3 of 4 was a Saturday night, but the restaurant was dead not even half full. which was shocking I have never seen it that empty on a Saturday night. What was more shocking was waiting an HOUR for two 3 piece dinners with sides! And after an hour wait the chicken was bland and the sides were cold! The butter wasn't even melting on the cornbread.   Visit 4 of 4 Friday night very busy, our food came out about 15 to 20 minutes after we ordered it. Everything hot; but the chicken was bland like no salt had been used.   Also clean up your act.... the couches on the patio are so filthy nasty stained and dirty that I wouldn't let my DOG sit on them UGH!  Prior to the franchise; we would receive fast, friendly service, delicious hot food and felt happy to return and bring all of our friends. Now it has been one epic fail after another. The staff is more concerned with their social lives than their jobs!  Given the last 4 experiences in the restaurant; and the fact that it is national fried chicken day several co-workers and I decided to order some food for lunch and pick it up. No big deal right?  WRONG! I called to place the order and the girl tells me \"We don't take to go orders; you have to come in and order it and wait here until it's ready\" SERIOUSLY??? Well folks be prepared for Lo Lo's downtown at least to go under soon! If they last another 2 years at this location I will be surprised. The service sucks, the food is going down hill and now you can't even do a phone order? These people treat you like you are doing them a damn favor by eating there! Which we are; because when we stop spending our hard earned money here; because of your funky attitudes like you've won a Michelin star you'll be out of jobs and out of business.",

    "text": "As I sit and WAIT after being told \"Don't stand at the door!\" by a grumpy \"hostess\"(?) THE moment I walked through it... I feel compelled to start writing my review as I pray that the food is even worth the 45 minute wait, after also being told by two people we could order drinks only to be told we in fact had to make our way back to the hostess stand,  order AND pay for drinks up front, THEN to be told \"well just wait for your table so it'll be easier for YOU to get drinks\"...   We are finally (called party of 5 although we specifically said 6!) AND were refused addition of 1 person (five minutes after we walked in, unless we didn't mind being bumped to the bottom of the list?!?)   Clearly by now, if I wasn't with 5 other folks I'd run for the hills... long story short, the food took over 30 mins, my drink came out with no ice (jack n pepsi) after my friend warned me to remove my straw as it had been excessively groped by a server... the waitress was clearly rushing and not focusing on a quality interaction despite our wait.   I asked a gent if the grumpy lady up front was the owner and he said \"No, but I'm the manager\" and listened to a very succinct review of what we experienced during our first impressions of the Place.  I let him know we were all just visiting town and were just hopeful that the food would be \"on point.\"   I toyed with the idea of trying the classic chicken n waffles (breast) because all great cooks know, a True culinary lover KNOWS how to make a juicy breast... instead I tried the #9- two thighs and a waffle.... only to be amazed that even the \"foolproof\" dark meat wasn't handled with care... soggy skin, lackluster-holiday-inn-style waffle... We were ALL ready for the check.   Manager Joseph brought a fresh jack n pepsi for me, and the massive waste of food we left over is available for viewing in my \"AFTER\" photos attached to this review. ..   Hey LOLo, if I wanted to pay for bad service I'd check out this place called \"Dicks\" where apparently some good (albeit vulgar) jargon is tossed at you on purpose... but I'd bet they could make a better plate of chicken n waffles even if they had their petrified grandpappy working the deep fat fryer in the back.... Too honest? Perhaps... but sadly this EXACTLY was what we experienced... Now I'm seriously going to question all four-star reviews I read in Yelp PHX, and that just makes me sad on a whole different level. Adios.",

On our lunch break, we decided to go there. The wait was no joke, 30 to 40 minutes outside in the heat in August. -_- After a while, we couldn't take it anymore, we went inside for the last 10 minutes. Inside the restaurant was pretty rustic and quaint. It had a good vibe to it and seemed pretty clean. My only problem with it were the flies. Nasty little buggers kept trying to land on our food. They couldn't have it though. ^_^ Once we were seated, the waitress was quick to take orders for food and drink. Of course all of us ordered chicken and waffles. What else would we order there. That was the whole point of coming here..lol.. ^_^  I ordered the two piece chicken with waffles. I also got a sweet tea (that came in the large Mason jar), which in my opinion wasn't sweet enough. I have a very large sweet tooth ^_^ As for the food, the waffles were good, they just weren't as crispy as I would like, a little bit too soft for my liking. The chicken was a little bit too salty. I'm a skin kind of girl and although I did eat the skins, I could've done without it. Unfortunately the chicken wasn't the \"chew the bone\" kind of chicken that I like. Although it was still good.. I know there are other locations, so if I'm ever in Phoenix again, would give Lo Los another try..",

They serve all their drinks in mason jars, and they have a hilarious menu!! If you have the time read through the menu and you will see what I mean. I ordered the chicken tenders with a waffle and oh boy I was happy. The chicken tenders tasted just like my moms homemade ones! Super juicy and literally tender I wasnt expecting that. The waffle was also really good, it had a good sweet maple flavor. My boyfriend got the thigh, leg, and waffle combo. The chicken was southern style fried (different from my tenders) he absolutely loved them. He could not get over the flavor and juciyness of the chicken. We were both surprised the chicken was not super greasy! All in all lets just say we did not need to go boxes ;D",

    "text": "I had been eating at the Scottsdale location all my time in the valley, so decided to give the original a try. Lo-Lo's just recently moved into the building next-door, and the original shack has been bulldozed. While waiting for the rest of my group, I loved being able to watch the food being made through the window! Staff was super friendly and we were seated by Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White himself. I also really liked the atmosphere inside with the mason jar lamps and all. Looking forward to coming again when live jazz is being performed!  Now on to the actual food part. I ordered the #10 Tre-Tre's with a blue Kool-Aid. One awesome thing I noticed in comparing it to my experience in Scottsdale is that the chicken legs have waaay more meat on them. It's almost as if the meat on a breast at the Scottsdale location equates a leg at the Phoenix one. Definitely a good thing! The waffle was just as amazing as I've always experienced. I will be definitely returning to this spot.  Oh, and if you didn't read my review of the Scottsdale location, take my advice and ORDER THE BANANA PUDDING! You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Great Food and a great atmosphere for dining with groups. Typically the restaurant is pretty loud during busy hours. Also they have a live DJ who mostly appropriate music that all guest can enjoy. The restaurant has a country/industrial theme. The outside seating area is nice for when you wait, which is almost guaranteed if you come for dinner especially on weekends. A big bonus is the restaurant has valet parking that is free (but please tip). I suspect it could be because the fence on north side is always being hit by customers. The parking lot is not large enough to accommodate the restaurant when at full capacity. Addition parking is on the neighborhood streets or across the street and industrial building. Most of staff are young and spirited. Service: it's not what I wish it would be. Food comes out at various times, which can be annoying if you get your food and you party gets theirs 15 minutes later. This seem to be more so with parties of 4 or more. The managers are pretty stiff and rigid. Definitely not \"the customer is always right\" type. They are not friendly and spunky like the waiters. They're expanding by adding locations at a face pace due to them franchising the restaurant. Hopefully they can get the customer service level up and earn the fifth star. Lastly the crowd is very diverse at all times. Black owned and operated which is a plus for me.",

Food:  We ordered fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, waffles, salmon patties, collards, green beans and cornbread.  Everything was hot and delicious along with a melon margarita.

I went to Lo-Lo's on a Monday night and it was packed; we were seated immediately in  a little room in the back called the chicken coop. Adorable! I had grape Kool Aid in a mason jar (giant jars) and probably much too sweet for me though. I also had the Lil Amadi (that may be misspelled) which was 2 pieces of wonderful chicken and a fluffy waffle. SO good. The chicken was no greasy at all. We also had potatoes, biscuits and cole slaw that we shared at our table.  Service was slow, but completely understandable with every single table full. Great meal, servers were friendly and the prices were reasonable.  The restaurant has a parking lot which was full but we found parking right on the side street next to the building.",

Seating policy is that everyone in the party must be present before the party is sat, so even if certain people come early to reserve seating, you won't be put on the list until everyone arrives.   Cannot remember our servers name but she was fabulous. Did a great job. Ordered #4 with two waffles and two chicken and it was awesome !!   However, the best part of the meal was the sweet tea. If I could come here everyday for that sweet tea I would. (This is not an exaggeration. That tea was brought here by the tea gods themselves)   Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Like any good Canadian knows, nothing goes together better than Tim Horton's coffee and a honey cruller. As it turns out, here in AZ, nothing goes better with fried chicken than crispy waffles! I have driven by Lo-lo's many times. Having enjoyed chicken and waffles at the famous Roscoe's in LA years ago, I kept meaning to give this a try. The only trouble is unlike years ago, I'm now trying to avoid fried food, as well as wheat so the concept of eating fried bird and fried batter was a conundrum to say the least. I decided after 6 months of staunch resistance to let my hair down and give Lo-Lo's a try. I went for lunch on a weekday. The place is directly south of downtown, in a fairly sketchy area. Despite the location, it was PACKED! It's always busy. Here's why: It's billed as a soul food place however there were guys in suits and ladies out for lunch and families and singles like myself. Good soul food attracts a diverse crowd. Seems we might solve the worlds problems by having everyone discuss international conflict with a belly full of soul food.  The service from the moment I walked in was fast and friendly.  I got a table right away. My Server was a fun and spunky young woman named Jerri. She brought me an ice tea: huge mason jar! Seemed all the beverages are served this way to ensure no one needs endless refills.  The menu is colorful and tongue in cheek, with plenty of Ebonics word play. Being 25% black, I managed. Though my Canuck heritage kinda cancels any of that out! I opted for the standard 3-piece fried chicken meal with 2 sides. One has the gravy and onions option, but for my first visit I needed to taste the bird as it comes from the fryer! As I don't eat much carbs these days, I chose spicy collards and string beans with red potatoes.   The food is delicious. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be something other than what it is: down home Southern delicious! The fact that most of the chicken and sides are ready to go back in the kitchen, I had my plate hot and in front of me in about 3mins flat! I chose to eat the cornbread as the heck with the carbs my black side wanted that bread! I poured out some of Lo-Lo's signature hot sauce, added a bit of honey and it was on like Donkey Kong! I savored every crispy, spicy, delectable bite! The way I eat chicken is pretty simple: If I can chew or crunch it, it's going down the chute: skin, meat, cartilage, wing-tips, you name it, it's gone! I love eating chicken with my wife cuz I get to eat twice once she's done. \"You're not finishing that?!\" I inquire looking at what to me amounts a 2/3 eaten morsel reaching for it...she has learned to simply look away and block out the chilling sounds of a carnivore devouring its crispy, salty prey. Once I had finally eaten every possible scrap on my plate, Jerri came by and looking at the meager remains on my now barren plate, asked with a wry smile \"You gonna eat the bones too or are you finished?\" I said \"My only regret is that I don't have an extra stomach or I would order round 2!\" If you want a real down home, down south, downtown fried chicken experience with our without waffles, get you DOWN to Lo-Lo's. You'll be back!  I'm down.",

I've also been to chicken & waffle places up and down the west coast, so I know what I'm talking about here. In the end, nothing quite stacks up to the OG, Roscoe.  Still, doesn't mean that Lo-Lo can't throw in a contender. And quite a contender it is. His sendup of the classic most definitely works for me. Fluffy waffle, and tender fried chicken doused in Louisiana-style hot sauce. That's what I'm talking about. Can't forget the mac & cheese either, which was a very healthy portion.   The food is good, but what won me over? Lemonade. Unlike Roscoe's, Lo-Lo's will refill your lemonade. Can't go wrong with that. Service was fantastic, and even with a half-hour wait on a Friday night, everyone was still pleasant and happy. Just wish I wasn't so full to try that red velvet cake.  No one will ever step to Roscoe, but Lo-Lo and Sandra Dee in Sacramento are more than qualified contenders to the title.",

Got there about 8:30 and it wasn't crowded. I thought it was closed. We were sat quickly and unfortunately the food came just as quick. We were served cold macaroni and cheese, rice and gravy(rice was hard), cold collars greens and fried chicken that wasn't fresh. My \"candy sweets\" weren't orange they were brown like it was old. We sent several dishes back for new ones but it got to the point where we just said forget it. The waitress fixed the food with no issue but we shouldn't have been served old and cold food to begin with. Maybe the Scottsdale location is better because the Phoenix location food quality has gone down. Unless you have to go before 8:30 to get fresh food. Food should be served fresh until the restaurant closes.",

Chicken was okay,  nothing  special ; waffles okay (cinnamon was a nice touch); mac & cheese good, but we make it as good @ home with Velveeta; collards good, little spice was nice, but again we make better. Hot sauce was standard Louisiana hot sauce, nothing unique.  Leaving, I noticed a big bowl of shrimp mac & cheese, and server said it s best thing on the menu... now you tell me.

    "text": "I will start by saying this is a really tough review to write, but given what happened I feel compelled to warn others.  If you are White I would recommend you steer clear of this location because it's pretty obvious you and your money aren't welcome here.  We went on a Saturday morning.  There were 8 of us (4 adults and 4 kids).  When we arrived we were told it would be about a 30-35 minute wait.  We agreed to wait around.  2 minutes later another large group (7 people, not white) arrives.  I was still standing next to the hostess counter.  She informs them it would be a 40-45 minute wait, glances over at me, and then looks back at the other party and says \"we might be able to make it sooner.\"  I didn't think much of it until I saw a large table open up (about 5 minutes later).  I thought to myself awesome we will be seated in no time after all.  But to my shock they called the party of 7 to be seated.  I politely asked why they went ahead of us, and she boldface looked at me and said only 7 people can fit at that table (there was room for 8 lol).  They waited 45 minutes until a table in the very back corner opened up.  No apologies, no thanking us for our patience.  Quickly afterwards the waitress came by, got our drink order, and returned 2 minutes later with the drinks.  What I noticed right away though is she wouldn't actually look at any of us.  I thought it odd, but continued to have faith it would be a good meal.  I then watched our waitress go to her other tables of people that were seated AFTER us to take their food orders.  She kept visiting those tables but refused to come back to the corner to take our order. (Again we are the only white people in the restaurant)  It took almost 20 minutes to get our food ordered (only 5 plates since our kids don't eat that much and we were sharing family style).  I thought no big deal because I was watching table after table who ordered before us getting their food in 15 minutes or less.  It took over 40 minutes to get our food.  In those 40 minutes the waitress never swung by for refills, or to apologize for the wait.  BUT the next scenario is what helped remove any doubt I had left about the situation we found ourselves in.  When the food finally was delivered, the waitress came by RIGHT AWAY before we had even taken a bite and asked if we needed any to-go boxes!!!!!  I was absolutely shocked and amazed in this day and age, at an established business, this would occur.  Even my kids started asking me \"Dad, why do they want us to leave so bad\".  It broke my heart they had to witness this behavior and prejudice.  I had to wait until we got home to help educate them on how sometimes people will treat you different based on the color of your skin.  It's almost surreal that we just wanted to come enjoy a meal and some amazing waffles, but were then confronted with this crap.",

One of my best friends used to visit Phoenix a couple of times a year to visit his then gf.  He always looked forward to eating at LoLo's.  So as soon as I picked up my rental car I drove straight here! It was a friday morning, but after normal breakfast time, so it wasn't that packed.  However, they only offered valet.  Which was very annoying.  It was complimentary but totally unnecessary.    Once inside, we were seated immediately, their menu has a lot of options, which did get my gf, but for me there was no reason not go with one of the chicken and waffle combos.    Their sweet tea is SUPER Sweet, so if you're not used to the south and sweet tea, be prepared to be overwhelmed.  My gf got the red velvet pancakes based on the picture, I tried to persuade her to get a chicken and waffle combo, instead.  Well she got it, and didn't eat past the 2nd bite.  They were pretty bad.  I got one of the biggest chicken and waffle combos, that came with eggs, grits, and I think 4 pieces of chicken?  So there was plenty to share.  The chicken itself, was just OK, the Breakfast Klub in Houston is much better.  The waffles however, were pretty damn good.  It tasted like there was orange flavor mixed into the batter?  But the price was just so much for simple southern food.",

We waited on their nice little patio for our entire group to arrive in order to be seated.  Finally our stragglers arrived and we were able to check out the menu. Very simple, home style food. Lots of different options to chose from. I decided on the classic chicken and waffles, my husband decided on just the waffle and a side of mac and cheese. His waffle was huge (thats what she said), and he really enjoyed his mac and cheese. I was very happy w/ my juicy chicken and waffle. It really was so so good. And the Koolaid! Awesome. It wouldve been better if it was served in Ball jars instead of Kerr jars, but Im biased. :)  Go here. Brave the wait and be deliciously rewarded.",

The manager came out just long enough to see which table we were and then disappeared into the back. Our food came out immediately after, but the chicken was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, and the portion for their $4 okra side was TINY (maybe ten pieces).  When we asked our waitress what happened she had no apologies only excuses, and the manager never came out to apologize either. In the end they did give us a slight discount but it didn't even cover one of the meals we waited so long for.

Okay, fine, bring it out.  ... along with the soul food platter, which consists of one HUGE piece of catfish, one piece of chicken (your choice on which part you want) smothered with gravy and onions, two sides (get the mac & cheese/beans over rice) AND CORNBREAD!

It's got this, cinnamon streusel, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Mini Eggo Cinnamon Toast taste to it...AND it's a thick waffle too, the consistency is on point.  Now let's talk about this chicken though.  SO juicy.  Cooked PERFECTLY.  Seasoned to the T!  And when it comes out to your plate, it comes out piping HOT and FRESH.  Caution: you get A LOT of food!  Your plate is literally covered.  Which I had NO problem with it.  The sides, I was so torn as to what to get, but I ended up with the collard greens and the mac & cheese.  The collard greens were good, but not seasoned enough to me liking.  I had to add a little salt, some hot sauce, that helped, but I mean, I've had better from my mom and grandmother.  The mac & cheese was good, a little on the dry side, but good cheesy/buttery flavor nonetheless.  I DO know one thing.  When I go back to Phoenix, I plan on getting the Shrimp & Grits and their Fried Green Tomatoes.  They passed by my table too many times on a tray and they look AMAZING!",

I eyed LoLo's for awhile on yelp, and heard commendations from friends, but I still had my doubts.  I finally decided it was time to see for myself.  So I ventured over to the area that is rumored to be a little sketchy.  And I can see why people say that.  But LoLo's itself is definitely a diamond in the rough.  And no,  they are not overrated.  Waffles with fried chicken and mac and cheese and red velvet cake.  Get It.    Service was friendly and efficient.  They seem to be always busy, and the staff was on top of it.  With all the great reviews I don't need to go into too much detail, everything is just repeated a hundred times anyway.  But do come, and come prepared to stuff yourself.",

So today we thought we would give them one more try. We waited 20min to get seated as it is always busy. It took over 10 minutes before we saw our server. We ordered fried green tomatoes immediately. 20 minutes pass and no appetizer. She then comes by and says \"you ready to order?\" I said no where are the tomatoes? She stated oh well there still cooking they will be here and her attitude just changed as if we were bothering her BC we had not ordered.. Another approx 8 min later she brings out the worst looking tomatoes I've ever seen. The tomato was about 2 1/2 in in diameter an almost burnt and get this, I took a bite ...cold..I mean not even warm. I told my hub \"that's it!!, we are out of here\" I was so upset. All the food that we saw coming out of the kitchen looked good and boy I was just so looking forward to the chicken. Never again. We know how long it takes to get food, I just do not understand how it took so long and to just get cold food. Totally frustrated. I do not think getting hot food is too much to ask.",

I was enjoying my meal with friends, eating chicken and waffles when all of the sudden I turn my chicken over, AND THERE WAS LITERALLY A CHICKEN BRAIN STUCK TO THE BOTTOM. Now, I didn't really care because I can understand how it could happen but when the manager was notified, he literally said straight to my face that it was not a brain, and perhaps a gizzard. Im sorry, but if you have eyes, you could tell it was a brain. Even so, there was something in my food that shouldn't of been. He stood there and argued with me, making a scene. Even the server who took my food to the manager, said it was a brain and was disgusted. The manager did not say sorry, said he wouldn't comp my meal because I had eaten most of it before finding the brain. How in the hell is this guy a manager.... we asked nicely to have it comped and everyone knows it is super easy to do, yet he refused. I was literally so chill about it till he told me it wasn't a brain. He finally comped my meal because I didn't eat all of my waffles and barely finished my drink, NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS A BRAIN IN MY FOOD, after 10 minutes of arguing and convinicing and threatening to walk out. I was literally shaking and can't believe the reaction. I have videos that could make this shit go viral. Don't eat here, unless you're okay with bad service and like to eat brains. Photo to follow.

The back parking lot does not have good lighting but as my brother is big and has a lot of muscles I was not too concerned. We rode in on a Friday at about 9 p.m. and ask for a patio table. It was about 10 minutes before they cleaned the table off. I questioned the waitress about beers and wine and whatever else they had. Ended up ordering a Chardonnay.  I got a plain waffle with dark meat two legs. My brother ordered some kind of waffle with 3 different dark meats. Add an extra chicken thigh please.   She brought us out some water and I asked her where my wine is at. She said you didn't order anything with me. There weren't that many people there and she was the only server that came to the table. My brother even told her that he hates when I drinks but he knows that I ordered something. So it was kind of awkward. So the food showed up almost the same time as the glass of wine and of course he did not get his extra thigh. She did not act like she knew that she messed up the order. Just  inadequate service with no apology the whole time. But the food was great. The waffle was so delicious. I wish I could have finished it. My brother got something with two waffles in dark meat in the extra thigh and he devoured it. I couldn't eat all of mine. I should have took it back to my brother's place. This place is delicious. Omg.I just found there's one in Dallas. I will be there!",

I ordered a #8 Betty's Boob or 1 chicken breast & 1 waffle, a side of Mac & cheese, koolaid & fried gizzards to go. The food was good. I'm not sure why the buzz about the two (chicken & waffles) together is so big. Together they were good but individually would've been just as good. The service was fast & friendly.  Our server forgot my mac at first but no big deal. The price is my only thing I'd criticize.  $20 plates for fried chicken? I'm just saying.  It's hot, juicy and well seasoned but still it's only fried chicken.  However, if you're looking for some real soul food you it's worth it.",

Delicious fried chicken that taste even better the next day.  Mac and cheese, greens, corn bread and even the waffle was delish.  Great for any size portions you want.  My kids loved and i'm sure they will be back more often. there're young and can afford the extra calories, haha.",

The waffles were not the Belgian style and tended to be a little dry. The fried chicken was served hot but lacked any distinguishable seasoning. The salmon croquettes were good flavor however they were a little light on the salmon and heavy on breading.   I would eat there again, but would try different menu items and another order of fries green beans. Generous sized drinks (served in a large mason jar) help you wash down your meal!  Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly.",

I used to come here a bit when I lived in Phoenix, and I go back every time I got to Phoenix, I have been to most the locations except for the one in East Valley. I never wrote a review before because I simply forgot lol, but I remember now, because I was just at Lolo's around 1pm TODAY before catching my flight, and the service was completely horrible. I have been to Lolo's 10+ times and out of all those times I have had great service about 3-4 times.  Again the food is great! The service not so much, it's horrible, if you know the service is trash going in it's easier to get through your meal because you know even though it doesn't make it any less irritating.",

Both times we had friendly servers and the service was pretty fast. While we received our food fairly quickly, the follow up was poor. I noticed that both times the servers would disappear for extended periods of time so it took awhile for us to get refills on our drinks, to go boxes, our check, etc. But I guess it worked out because it gave us time to catch up with friends.   I had the chicken and waffles both times and it was very tasty. I would definitely go back. They always play great music too. Takes me back to my younger days",

Done  I will definitely be back when I am back in Phoenix.  I will have to try the koolaid and see what they are working with. Hopefully it is a jar of colored sugar water like koolaid is supposed to be. Haha.   Looking forward to coming back and I don't say that often.",

The food is tasty enough and I would expect that LoLo's is the finest chicken and waffles joint in Arizona.  I spend a lot of time in Atlanta on business where chicken and waffles is considered an art form so I'm spoiled by Gladys Knight!  Seriously, the waffles are delicious!  Some of the best that I've had anywhere...  I'm not sure what is going on with the frozen butter/crisco on the waffles but I could do without it.  The chicken is pretty good but it is fairly greasy....  I had the chicken fried chicken and it was a solid offering topped with sausage gravy.  I wanted to try the banana pudding but I succumbed to the chicken, waffles, chicken fried chicken, corn bread, rice/beans,etc...  You won't leave here hungry!",

I especially love it in the morning; when everyone else is ordering a light breakfast, expect me to go for the fried chicken.  Lo-Lo's was just alright for me.    I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I can't put my finger on the flavor.  I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably won't be back.  I know Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less \"affected\" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Lo's feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. White's... you know... the one with the Letter in Football.  Anyway, I am glad Lo-Lo's is thriving...  Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location sometime to see if they have a different spin on things.",

The Pilgrimage to this wee building on a small side street in downtown PHX was made on a cold, rainy Sunday - perfect weather for comfort food!   After strategic review of the menu consisting of a price volume mix analysis to determine the right combination of entrees and side items to reach Pareto Optimality, my friend and I ended up with a table full of goodness: Lo-Lo plate (2 waffles + 3 chicken breasts), 1 additional waffle, home fries and (no surprise here) mac n cheese.    The food arrived quickly (benefit of arriving right at opening time!), and this is where all conversation stopped.  No talking, just eating and lots of it.  I surfaced for air once or twice to mumble random things about how good everything was, but that's about it.  I don't know how the Lo-Lo's Chicken Magicians manage to make fried chicken that is not greasy - it is crispy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside.  The waffles taste slightly of cinnamon and I am not ashamed that I used the entire portion of butter that was riding on the top.  All of it.  Hard arteries are strong arteries, right?    Halfway through the mac n cheese I noticed the Red Rooster Louisiana Hot Sauce on the table - liquid fire!  Had to douse the remaining portion and feel the burn...  Yeah!!  OK Phoenix, I get it.  I know now what I have been missing all this time.  I will be back in about 4 months, when my cholesterol levels return to normal...  :)",

It was a very warm environment. We went on a Sunday, so of course it was over booked and quite crowded. The wait staff handled it with ease.   I ordered the meal with the waffles, the grits, eggs, and chicken. The grits, eggs and waffles--ALL wonderful. The chicken was dry. I didn't realize this, until I ordered chicken from Church's a week later and realized, \"Lolo's chicken was dry...\"  I would go again....but I will probably avoid the chicken to be honest.",

Our server was alert of any needs our table had and was on top of things! He also checked up on us frequently. Our food came out less than 10 minutes after ordering -- Uhm??! Amazing!!! Especially since we were so hungry. I thought we'd be waiting a lot longer since it was a little busy when we went in. I got \"Tre-Tre's\" which was two crispy chicken legs and a beautiful cinnamony soft waffle with warm syrup. I also got a side of creamy mac n cheese, which was the BEST mac I've ever had!!!! My husband got some honey wings with Lo-Lo's hot sauce. I loved the balance of flavor in them! Also, they have great home made drinks, soft drinks, and tons of kool-aid served in huge mason jars! Just go visit this place!!! Like, now!!",

Our food came out 47 minutes after we ordered although the server was very apologetic the manager NEVER came to the table to apologize. The \"taste\" of the food was good but it was cold my chicken breast was dry and probably the smallest chicken breast I've ever seen. I mentioned it to the food runner he rolled his eyes and walked away! WOW!!! My husbands order was wrong he ate it anyway and when he ask for a water refill it literally took 10 minutes after the server took his glass, When we reminded him we needed the water still he said he had to request water refills with kitchen! Huh? Very disappointed, just not worth it! Guaranteed if they had a competitor close by Lo Lo's would cease to exist. Longest Lunch known to man thank God it was my day off.",

I am from California and I didn't think anyone could surpass the infamous Roscoes Chicken and Waffle but I was mistaken.   I had the betty boop (1 chicken breast with 1 single waffle) accompanied by a side of greens. Delicious! Some of my highlights include the following:  - the chicken was flavorful AND tender and juicy - the waffle was crispy and flavorful  - the greens were delicious not too soggy or salty - the service was stellar!  - had a family feel (they displayed family photos) - seating of large parties (We were a party of 7 and they were able to accommodate us. We sat in a room next to the kitchen. We saw all the action through the glads window)   Some recommendations: book through yelp or on the phone. Once you arrive there may still be a wait. This place is amazing. I included my before and after pic. I devoured it all!  I only wish we had one here in my hometown. I'd go back to Phoenix just for Lo-Lo's.",

They highly recommended Lo-Lo's as one of their favorite places to go to. Alright, it's worth a spin, especially since they said it's better than Roscoe's (although to be fair, that's not a hard bar to clear).  Despite me trying to keep on my diet...well, I'm not exactly visiting Phoenix everyday. So of course I had to try the fried chicken and waffles! Kept it simple and ordered the #3 Lo-Lo's with all dark meat. I would say the fried chicken is more solid than spectacular. The batter is alright, nothing overly memorable but still good. Definitely better than your run-of-the-mill fried chicken, but nowhere near the best I've had. Waffles were not bad, but I could only finish one of them...ended up giving one of them to my friend to take home.  Service here is solid, no complaints here.  Wait time did take about 30 minutes. I was fairly befuddled by the fact that we literally waited at the front for a good 5-10 minutes before finally being attended to. I get they're busy, but there's no excuse to not have someone manning the front at all times. Also was shocked at how no one was keep tracking of who was in line until someone finally got the idea to write names down. Considering how popular Lo-Lo's appears to be, I expected better.  I liked Lo-Lo's, although I'm not sure it's a must for me if I ever come back to Phoenix. Still a good meal, can't complain about that!",

We got there at 815a and there were already plenty of people sitting inside. Ordered the Soul food platter 2 thighs 1 leg with a side of Mac n cheese and collard greens. It was delicious I wish I could eat it all up again. The fried chicken was so juicy and soft the meat melted in my mouth and the Mac n cheese had perfect texture and a delicious kick of spice from the collard greens. To top it off it came with a slice of corn bread omg that thing was so delicious. I would fly back to AZ to eat here again.   Parking in the back lot. Early shift had a limited staff service was kinda slow, but we weren't in a rush. However the food came out quick. So that makes up for that   Overall food was great 10/10 would recommend",

The skin wasn't as crispy, and although the leg was moist other pieces were dry. One order is plenty for two people. Since it's fried chicken it takes a good amount of time to make/come out. I also ordered (and recommend) the mac and cheese.  Prices: the Lo Lo will run you about $15, and the mac and cheese is around $5.  Parking: There are two parking lots: one adjacent to the restaurant, and another dirt lot on W. Yuma St. There's also unmetered street parking on Yuma as well.  People: fun for all ages.  Perks: They have both indoor and outdoor seating, and they have a texting system to let you know your table is ready. They play old school and recent jams, so the music is spot on. The staff were excellent. It gets super busy, so expect a wait during peak hours.",

    "text": "This was my breakfast during my Day 1 out of 6 of the Arizona trip.  I got the traditional item: Lo-Lo's. It's waffles with syrup and fried chicken. For the chicken I chose to get 2 thighs and a leg.   Boy let me tell you, this was easily one of the most delicious fried chicken ever! I mean fried chicken is usually a bit bland at most places, and a bit dry and fibery. But nope, not this place. The chicken was tender, soft, and fall off bone sort of stuff. And flavor was amazing, it was simple but yet was great.  Their Lo-Lo's hot sauce goes along quite well with the chicken, so throw that stuff on there generously.   The waffles were good. I mean you can't really innovate much with plain waffles, so let's leave it at that.   Price-wise, it's a bit pricey. It's like $16 bucks or something for this.  The portions are very hearty. There was an extra powered Lo-Lo's item which comes with egg and grits or something. Glad I didn't do that, as I barely finished this one.   Sad that I didn't get try the cat fish, and no idea if I'll be able to, since I live in Seattle.",

    "text": "One of the friendliest and most cheerful servers I've had in a long time! We had a lot of fun having dinner at Lo-Lo's - my virgin visit to this Phoenix institution.  Most everything shouts comfort here: comfortable environment, comfy booth, and, most important: comfort food! We ordered different versions of the fried chicken and chicken-fried chicken with an assortment of sides: cheesy grits spinach red beans and rice mac & cheese I didn't care for the spinach - way too bitter! But I loved my grits and the red beans and rice were interesting, they had a BBQ flavor to the beans that I liked a lot. Now let's get down to the chicken. Amazing. It came out in no time at all and was crispy and moist ad the coating was nicely seasoned. I ordered plain wings and they were huge!  Top off your meal with some koolaid or sweet tea and you will leave in a food coma! These portions are hefty. I kinda like that, especially when we're talking comfort food because I want to bring some home for later! So for $17 for 3 pieces of chicken (or mix & match, chicken with fish) and 2 sides and you are eatin' good. We didn't experience any sort of wait on a Thursday evening and the service was spot on (Nica, you rock!). Staff checked in on us, clearing plates and checking in on our meal. That's how it's done.  Good food and a welcoming vibe is probably why people keep coming back. I know I will.",

    "text": "I love fried chicken and was really excited when I saw that Phoenix had a 4-star fried chicken and waffle restaurant. I knew I had to make the trek to eat at this restaurant while I was here. Sadly, it was one of the most disappointing restaurants I ate here.   One of the big pluses about this restaurant was that you were able to put yourself on the waitlist on Yelp instead of doing it in person. I was luckily able to add myself at our Airbnb and arrive on time to and wait an additional 10 minutes before being seated.   The server was very attentive in the beginning while seating us and giving us a couple of minutes to look over our order. But, after everyone was ready to order our server was nowhere to be seen. We waited 15 minutes and tried to flag her down many times but to no avail. After we had placed our order (KK's / Mac and cheese / Kool-aid), 20 minutes has gone by and then 40 minutes. We started noticing that all the tables around us were not getting their food. There were tables that were seated before us that also did not receive their food. Not once did the manager nor the server ever stop by the restaurant to apologize for the delay or that they were having problems in the kitchen.   After approximately waiting 50 minutes, our food finally arrived. Because of the delay and rushing to get orders out, all of the food was mediocre. The fried chicken had a slight crunch on the skin but was dry and the waffles were soggy and undercooked. The mac and cheese were cold, limpy and soggy and lacked flavor. The grits that were part of KK's also lacked flavor and needed a lot of salt to save it. The best part of the whole meal was the Kool-Aid.   I probably just came on a bad day, but I will probably not come back because of this experience and hope they will be able to fix the issues for future guests.",

The only solution was Lo Lo's, the epitome of comfort food. I ate the entire bowl while also nibbling on my husbands oreo pancakes and classic KK's (fried chicken and waffles).   Lo Lo's chicken and waffles is fantastic. For primarily featuring chicken and waffles, the menu is pretty lengthy, but in the end it is all delicious. The batter on the chicken is perfect. Seems to be deep fried and then baked, for a crispy crunch without being overly greasy. Grease cures hangovers, I'm convinced. The waffles were really good, with a surprising hint of cinnamon in the batter?  We got lucky with our wait (no wait at all) but the place soon got packed and wait area began to fill. Obviously popular and for good reason, don't forget to grab a banana pudding to-go on your way out!!",

Our wait time was about 20 minutes, but they accidentally skipped my party and started seating those who arrived after us. We ended up waiting about 35 minutes to be seated.   We ordered and after a long 45 minute wait our food arrived. First, our lemonades tasted like tap water which is unacceptable for almost $3. Just get a water. Next, I ordered the honey hot wings... I was very disappointed that the chicken had not been cleaned properly and I had to pull feathers out of multiple pieces of chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Lo-Lo special. He said the waffles were bland and would've preferred Waffle House. The chicken overall was nothing special. My boyfriend even compared it to the chicken from the Walmart bakery. Lastly, we ordered a side of mac and cheese and boy was it gross. It definitely did not resemble a southern baked mac and cheese.   I probably will not be returning and the food isn't worth the hype.",

The atmosphere was perfect, with hip hop songs my dad(age 50 something) knows, the scent of fried chicken, and a really well-maintained establishment.   Then we met our server, Sir. Even though the interactions were probably the everyday service, I felt like I took a semester of AP Table Waiting from one 40 minute meal. His demeanor was warm, welcoming, and casual; he talked to us like friendly acquaintances rather than customers. It's hard to describe but it was A+ and still professional.  Then the our dishes rolled out. There was so much food that my family couldn't finish their plates, but I was able to finish my \"Phat Azz Samich\"(which I got to order in front of my asian parents and younger siblings). The chicken sandwich was delicious and appropriately large, but I felt like I missed out by not getting one of the chicken and waffle plates or a soul food platter. I was distracted by the Phat Azz, so to speak. All the chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful, and all the sides simply amplified the experience. If I ever come back to Phoenix, I'm definitely going to try the soul food platter.  Also everything was well-priced and the water came in wide-mouth jars, which was funny to me. And we came in around 9:30 on a wednesday so there was no wait.",

Kind of disheartening when you're looking at a 45 minute wait.  Second, we waited 30 minutes for our food. I didn't mind, I know good food takes time. The problem I had was that the entree that arrived was not as I expected it to be. WTF is chef's choice??? The explanation I was given, was \"We serve whatever is available. Unless you specify that you want what is on the menu.\" Shady as hell!!! Me and my very special guest ate and enjoyed our Chef's Choice... It's just disappointing that this great food is partnered with such poor service. I have always taken visiting friends and family to Lolos, and recommended it to my coworkers and their families: but I will have to rethink that now. We will definitely not be back to the downtown location.",

Families (more than once) who arrived AFTER us were given a table based on race---which was made very apparent after witnessing a verbal \"thanks for hooking a brother up,\" asking the hostess for seating preferences, and fist pumping. Concerns were validated after  about 6 other caucasian families asked why another group was sat before them. This place needs more diversity and it goes to show racism can be felt by EVERY race. Nobody is exempt. Spend your money elsewhere (I suggest The Arrogant Butcher or CIBO) and don't support this particular franchise until a change is made. End racism. End hate. Love one another",

Soul food in general is usually delicious sin if you are counting calories but counting calories shouldn't even be thought of if entering this place; you'll want to try everything! By everything I mean chicken, waffles, grits, eggs, home fries, Kool-Aid and many many more goodies that are served here (and trust me, you should try as much as you can).   Go get yourself some soul food already and leave this place smiling!",

    "text": "Soul food in the desert!!!   I've only been to the Scottsdale location, so it's a bit too \"clean\" for my taste, but the food is a real treat.  Good break from the usual Mexican, chinese, pizza, etc.  Fried chicken with Gravy and Onions is my favorite.  Chicken loses some of its crispiness smothered in gravy, but that's a worthwhile trade off.  Sides are either really good or mediocre.  Avoid mac and cheese.  Very disappointing.  Red beans and rice are excellent. Collared greens are the best by far.  Spicy and hearty.  I'm not a big fan of grits, but they were creamy.  Service was a bit slow.  If you're planning on going during spring training, be weary of going after a Giants game as Lolo's is right down the street from the stadium and once the game's over, it gets really crowded and the service slows down more than usual.  Kool-Aid served in jugs?  Does it get any better than that?  I think not!  Red velvet cake is really moist and worth the trip by itself (slight exaggeration).  Price is a bit high, but portions are good and I didn't feel ripped off by any means.  Fun place and comfortable for the kids.",

    "text": "I knew when I saw a pimped out neon green DeVille sitting in Lo-Lo's parking lot that this meal was going to be epic.  I went solely for the chicken and waffles, and they more than delivered.  The prices here are much more reasonable than they are at a certain world-famous California-based place, and I'd argue that the food itself is better, too.  The crust on the chicken was light and it was fried perfectly -- crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside -- and the waffles?  Add that to the list of things I could eat all day.  There truly is something magical about a small bundle of fried chicken and a short stack of waffles, drowning in a sea of syrup, butter, and a little hot sauce.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.  I didn't get to try any of their other stuff, although literally everything on the menu sounded delicious, but then again what soul food dish doesn't?  I went in for a lunch, and other than a kid's birthday party there weren't many people there, so I didn't have any of the long waits or loud guest that apparently plague this location, but I don't know if that would have affected my opinion, because the food was just too good.    Next time I'm in the Phoenix area, I'll stop by, and maybe I'll get a chance to try some of their red velvet cake...if I can find the room.",

So don't be surprised to hand over your keys and have someone park for you.  The hosts were not very welcoming,  she made it seem like she had to go out of her way to take my name. The lady next to her was yelling \"NO STANDING IN ENTRY WAY - go outside or to the outside patio!!\" like how the heck am I supposed to know that or where the patio is, I've never been here in my life!  Very awkward and rude. Not a very comfortable environment at all.  The food was ok, and Kool aid and sweet tea was very very very sweet and music was turned up all the wayyy up.  The hosts were staring at everyone like hurry up and leave.  These people don't care about the quality of service, atleast not from my experience.  I thought about going back to try some of their other items on the menu but with their horrible hospitality I definitely won't go back.  I give it 2 stars because the place is nice and our server was nice.  It would of got 5 if the hospitality was better.",

It not too greasy, has a nice crunch to it and with their hot sauce, fire!  Here is the issue, the chicken is consistently tiny.  The drumsticks look like wing portions.  They used to serve chicken legs that look like small turkey legs, now when my plates arrives, I see more plate than food.  Now, they also serve Kool-Aid, which is incredible, but someone needs to take the sugar scoop away from the Kool-Aid maker and NEVER give it back.  When your Kool-Aid goes down like cough syrup...you might want to back off the sugar a bit.  Nothing like small chicken and thick Kool-Aid!",

We didn't have a reservation, but we lucked out and got there earlier than the rush, so we were seated in a nice booth up front.  The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).  Our waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good!   The meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table.   Despite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!  Overall: A+ Great service, great southern food with hilarious names (amazing dessert for a bonus), and fun ambiance make this place a \"will absolutely return\" venue!",

Koolade Punch flavor mixed with Lemonade - this was cute and believe it or not refreshing and worth ordering so much so I had a refill!  If I ever make it back to Phoenix. Lo Los Chicken & Waffles is going to be a Must stop for me! If you don't believe me see my pictures  and go try it for your self you will be hooked too!

    "text": "This restaurant is well known for Southern Style Foods.  Short Story-  Good Service and Good Crispy Seasoned Fried Chicken and Good Waffles but some of the other items not so good. The portions are crazy big and might satisfy GODZILLA.  Long Story- This pack was PACKED with people early at lunch time. The hostess informed us that it would be a half hour wait and her prediction was very accurate as it was. We ordered and our server brings out our beverages in large canning jars. We wait and wait and then our server informs us that the kitchen is backed up and it will be a while for our food to arrive. So we wait and wait and were are real hungry by now. Our food does eventually arrive sometime after a half hour.  I received a soul food platter. You have many choices on how to build your platter and I picked a chicken thigh, a fish, and two sides. This platter also comes with a corn bread.  Chicken- Good! Crispy Skin, Seasoned Nice, Moist!  Fish- Awful- Served broken in half, over cooked with a terrible ultra thick corn meal coating that might have been a 1/3 of an inch thick.   Macaroni and cheese- so-so-better than average for processed tasting cheese. Strong process cheese taste but doctored up well. Pasta was slightly over cooked. I note that I don't care for processed tasting Macaroni and Cheese. I know that most people only eat and make it that way so you might feel different than me depending on your taste.  Spicy Green Beans with Red Potatoes- Not Good- The green beans seemed almost canned. The beans might have been frozen but were very grey and over cooked. The potatoes seemed either steamed or boiled. They were not appetizing at all.  Corn Bread with GIANT ball of soft Butter- Good- sort of cake like, a little sweet and studded with corn. Tasted like a mix of cake with cornbread with LOTS of butter soaking in. It was like having a rich dessert. Also giant sized. You will hurt your self if you eat the whole thing.  My husband had the #3 Lo Lo's Plate. It cost $2.00 less than my plate and was a much better value. He had three pieces of chicken and waffles. I tasted a small piece of waffle and it was good.  Between the wait, The not so good fish, processed tasting macaroni and cheese and the not appetizing spicy green beans with red potatoes and the $42.35..brought things down for me.  If you stick with only the things that Lo Lo's does best you will do better than I did.  Go there when you are monstrously hungry.  3 Stars according to Yelp means A-OK and worth a try.   I give three stars when it's a mixed review with some reservations.",

A couple of months later, I went back again and OMG!!! What happened???!!!! I got the game hen version.  The drumstick was 4\" long and not even 2\" wide (I've posted pictures) so wrote a scathing review considering I looked at the other people chicken and it was twice the size of what me and my family got!    So my husband and Are in AZ for the next couple of days and I decided to let Lo Lo's redeem themselves.

    "text": "When I visit a place for a week I generally only eat at any given restaurant once so I can be sure to try as many places as possible.  For Lo-Lo's, though, I had to make an exception; their soul food is too damn delicious for only one serving.  I'm a big fan of the chicken and waffle combo, and was a regular at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles former Oakland location. I hate to denigrate the original, but Lo-Lo's takes Roscoe's formula and runs away with it.  First, their chicken is very, very good. Crispy skin, moist interior, just the right amount of spices. My only beef is I wish the pieces were slightly larger.  Second, the waffles are excellent and topped with an enormous round of butter. Just they way they should be. Crisp, dripping with butter, delightful.  Third, the sides... oh, lord, the sides. The collard greens are the best greens I've ever eaten, and I've had my fair share of good ones. Cooked perfectly, no bitterness. They make the south proud. The cheese grits are a bowl of cheesy, well cooked goodness and are not to be missed. The mac 'n' cheese was smooth, and bathing in cheese sauce (and did I detect some velveeta in the mix? oh, I believe I did! And this, my friends, is a very good thing), and the cheese eggs were fluffy and perfectly proportioned between eggs, cheese and onions.  Finally, the red velvet cake is an absolute must-- no matter how stuffed you may be. If I could be encased in the frosting I would die a happy young lady.  My only regret in going to Lo-Lo's was my lack of stomach capacity. Now I'll have to wait a year before I try their fish, peas, and other sumptuous looking offerings.  Word to the wise-- as other reviewers have said, get there early. The folks who run Lo-Lo's are nice as can be and get your food to you in a hurry, but the place is small and it fills up quick. We were in by 10:30 on two separate weekdays and got the last available table both times. Otherwise, you're setting up outside in line. And while Lo-Lo's makes the waiting as nice as possible, with a shade tent and water, who wants to stand around drooling over the smells coming out of that kitchen?",

Items we ordered  *2 chicken wings w/waffle *2 drumsticks w/red beans and rice *fried okra *greens *red velvet cake *1/2 tea and 1/2 sweet tea  Oh the chicken.....................not crispy and NO flavor!!  Like another reviewer said, \"my mom makes better fried chicken\"  - I couldn't agree with her more!  I was thinking about Popeye's chicken while eating this one.  Missing the crispiness and flavors.  The waffle was very good.  Had a hint of cinnamon.  Red beans and rice tasted like it someone opened a can of baked or chili beans and poured it over rice.  Popeye has won over this one too.  Thank goodness for the greens!!  They were tender and DELISH!!!!  But is it worth driving there to get greens.... i dunno...  The coating on the fried okra was hard.  Oh Noooo..... the red velvet cake was the WORST!!!  If there is Red Velvet cake at an establishment, I'll always try it.  I was sooooo disappointed with this one. I only took two bites and had to push it away.  It was too dense and it tasted like there was tons of oil in it.  The cake didn't have flavor, just red.  The frosting was waaay too sweet.  Try Tammie Coe's instead.     I grew up on Southern food and this place was not tasty at all.   The service was friendly, but slow.  One star is for the greens  One star for the waffle",

    "text": "Sinfully Delicious: A Ladies Lunch of Gluttony  Once upon a time there were two coworkers.  They had been talking about going to Lo-Lo's and kept saying they would go there as a reward when they met some of their fitness goals.  Well, one coworker left the company before they made their goals, so they went there with a third coworker for her going away lunch.  They were a little curious where they were being taken when they ended up in the middle of nowhere in a not-so-great neighborhood.  They found a parking spot after 5 minutes of driving around, u-turns, and backing up.  They walked into the small house and got a seat in the very back on the side seating area.  The place was packed.  Two ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.  The jar they brought it in seemed enough for the whole table, but somehow she managed to take it down without a problem.  She ordered Tre-Tre's (2 chicken legs and a waffle) and a side of Mac n' Cheese.  They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.  The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.  After the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.  It was glorious!  The server came with the bill and the gluttonous ladies were so full and in a food haze they could barely explain how to split the check.  They sat for a while before they were able to leave and finally made their way back to work.  They proceeded to dream all day about the chicken, waffles, mac n' cheese, cornbread, sweet tea, lemonade, and all the goodness they consumed in less than 20 minutes.  Some of the women were more comfortable for the remainder of the day based on their wardrobe choices.  Everyone else was none the wiser.  All that was left to do was plan their next trip to Lo-Lo's and also the sister restaurant Mrs. White's Golden Rule.  The End.  The moral of the story:  Wear big pants with an elastic waist and order everything that looks good.",

    "text": "Well, after being browbeaten by everyone I know who has been there some friends and I finally decided to make the drive down town to try Lo Lo's.  Following everyone else's advice here on Yelp we got there 10mins before they opened last Sunday. We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors).   Now, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it.   They used a \"shotgun\" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;) Anyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the \"famous\" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra. I am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out.   1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it True southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.  2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.  3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.  4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P  5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.  For drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.  Overall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)  Lo Lo, I sincerely hope this restaurant has made you a wealthy man because it would be a crime if it hasn't.",

    "text": "Hit Lo-Lo's again recently and it did not disappoint.  I definitely think this is the best fried chicken that I've ever had. Also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it. While I'd heard of the pairing, I'd never tried it prior to going to Lo-Lo's. Just works for me.   I also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said \"red cordial\"! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!  The rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.  Among us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit. We also modified our grits order to no butter (not sure if that is sacrilege) and while I don't know if my mouth enjoyed it quite as much, I didn't feel like I was going to die from richness as I'd felt after the previous visit.  The staff was super nice as always and we also love the atmosphere in there. Especially liked seeing the Shaq signature on the ceiling in the room with the counter.  Ready to go back!",

The southern fried chicken was crunchy, tasty, finger lickin' good (take that KFC)...and the thin buttery waffle also had a nice crisp edge, although next time I'm gonna try for extra crispy waffles...the mac & cheese was velvety smooth & rich...my first bite of rice & beans was an epiphany - the savory sauce was a perfect contrast against the sweetness of the waffles and crusty corn muffin - I now know that I have never truly had rice and beans before Lo-Lo's.  But my favorite was actually the fried catfish...dusted with cornmeal for a dry (not oily) crunch into oh-so tender flaky catfish.  I would have loved to order another one, but I was bursting.  However, as I went up to pay, I could not help but notice that luscious hunk of Red Velvet cake slathered with cream cheese frosting and studded with walnut...I gave into the siren call and ordered a piece to take home.  Unfortunately, the cake turned out to be a bit of a letdown despite being plenty moist - no taste of chocolate to be found and the icing was a tad thin.  The other thing I didn't like was the coffee, which was kind of watery...but hey that's kinda authentic too.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  When we told her that our eggs still had not hit the table even though we were almost done with the rest of the food, she offered us a choice of any side to take home.   This kind of service is rare and is also why I want to go back.",

My stomach was not built to handle fried food, I'll leave it at that. However if your stomach IS built to handle it, I'm assured that this chicken is fantastic.  I took the advice of other yelpers and ordered Sweet Tea with half un-sweet, and it was lovely.   Love: The Mason jars of \"drank.\" The cinnamony waffles. The friendly staff (all smiles, and quick to take care of you) The casual/comfortable ambiance. The menu items all nicknamed after, i assume, actual people. The tender/spicy collard greens.  I'll be back, but I accept that fried chicken and I will have to agree to disagree. Thankfully, there's enough at Lo Lo's to keep my tummy full and happy.",

Now I'm a regular, at least as much as my stomach can handle it. The portions are enormous, and delicious. I always order the #2, it's smothered chicken with waffles, with a kool aid, and it is perfect. Probably going to give me a heart attack, but you gotta live! You gotta show up early, even on a weekday for lunch this place gets packed, and you have to wait outside where its hot. Probably 8 of my 10 visits have been on sunday mornings after a hard saturday night at Rose and Crown or another pub, so it hits the spot for those mornings perfectly.   Oh, and to those saying this place is good for groups, what the hell? It's a small restaurant that doesn't take reservations. What about that is good for groups?",

The waffles are delicious and the chicken is very flavorful. My only complaint was the service. We got our drinks in a timely fashion. Appetizers came out 20 mins after receiving our drinks but when we got our entrees it was a whole different story. It was 3 of us. They brought out 2 of the 3 entrees and said my food was on the way. 5 mins went by. Then 10 and I still didn't have my food. Finally I got my order. My 2 other friends were more than half the way done. Also, my order was only partial. I ordered the #9 (Lil Almadi) or something like that and a side of Mac and cheese. She said my Mac and cheese was coming. I waited and waited and never got the Mac and cheese. She never even checked on us. It's like she completely forgot about us. I tried to flag her down on several occasions to inquire about my Mac and cheese, but she never noticed us. After 45 mins to an hour of just waiting, we finally got her attention and just ask for our check. It wasn't until I told her to remove the Mac and cheese from our check did she even remember. I spent the entire time here worrying and waiting. I never had the chance to relax and enjoy my meal. Even while I was eating, it felt awkward because my other 2 friends were done and they were just waiting for me to finish eating. I don't mind coming here again because I liked the food. But I will take it to go. I won't be dining here again.",

But I've never been much of a meat eater so I didn't eat if off the bone and have never thought to order it before. But coming to Phoenix this time my husband was craving his favorite lunch. He hadn't been here since the restaurant operated in the little house out back and he was a bit apprehensive that the food wouldn't be as good. He's was very happy that it was as delicious as he remembered.  The new restaurant is adorable. Very quaint with the rustic touches and decor but modern at the same time since it's relatively newly remodeled.  Trace got his traditional chicken and waffles. And I got the boneless version. The chicken was succulent with a tasty crispy fried crust, not greasy. The waffle was delicious with butter and a great syrup which soaked in. Portion size was generous with a good price. I had to use skill to eat it all, because my mouth most definitely wanted to. And who can forget the sweet tea, served in a mason jar. Our waiter Jessie was super friendly and very good as his job keeping our glasses full.  It's now one of my favorite places too.",

Service was very friendly and the facility was really nice, very welcoming and comfortable.

The wait was bad here. At least 20 mins for drinks and 30 for dinner. We didn't wait to sit though. Service was good. Kitchen sent out meals all at different times. That's sucks when you are in a group.  I think it was because the chicken is so damn fresh and cooked per order. Got the LoLo and it was the best chick and waffle combo I've had.  Chicken breading just right.  Good spice and the LoLo hot sauce makes it steller.  Waffle is so on point.  I'd smash that with or without chicken.  It was fluffy. Touch of sweet. Tad of vanilla and cinnamon. Delicious.  Oh they serve breakfast too all day.  Wish I lived closer to keep trying other menu items.  This is going to be our pregame eat and booze place before sporting events for sure!!!!!",

I'm not sure how many times I told him how good the food was, but I know it was a lot of times.  He was probably thinking, this corn fed Midwestern white chic keeps telling me how good my grits are and I'm trying to spend time with the family.    The service was very friendly, fun to chat with, and moved fast.  This is what we ordered  .........drum roll................   Na-Na's - Two waffles, two eggs, and a good helping of grits.  (I added a chicken breast to go with my waffles to this meal.)  Chicken Fried Chicken Dinner with greens, mac n cheese, and corn bread.  Chicken was smothered in sausage gravy.  Red Velvet Cake (to go)  STUPID Fries (to go)  Everything they had was (and looked) homemade, fresh, tasty, creamy, and oh so crispy.  (see photos)  Chicken was tender, crisp to perfection, and sultry.  Waffles were flaky and cinnamony.  Grits and the mac n cheese were creamy.  The greens had a major kick of spice to them and were not that spicy at the same time.  Corn bread was soft and crispy.  The cake was buttery yummy goodness.  And the Stupid Fries were, well, so good they will make you cross eyed.  Yes, I got a little bit of everything.  I wanted to try it all.  I got the cherry Kool-Aid to wash all this down too.  My bill was $50 for all that food, and it was worth every single penny.",

We also waited a long time to replace the fish with a different one.. My grits were the worst I've  had yet at Lolo's, they had a gelatin consistency and crust on the edges. I guess they figured I wouldn't notice with the ton of butter they put on the top of it. I am not sure about Lolo's anymore, the food was different this time around, and that's not a good thing. I am thinking there is a new cook or they might have been understaffed... Not sure what happened. I must say the waitress and manager were friendly, it was simply the food that's did not hit the mark.",

Seated is right away. Ordered a Bettie's Boop, and when it came, the chicken was beautiful and the smell of the waffle was incredible. It was almost like a spice cake. Definitely cinnamon and nutmeg, but the taste was amazing.  The chicken was juicy and tender. Breakfast was hands down one of the best I've ever had. Will fly to Phoenix just for breakfast!!",

The only reason for 4star because service is pretty slow. I had went on a Wednesday about 6:40pm. We set down right away. Ordered right away but our food did not come out till 7:50 a hour 10mina later. The waitress was pleasant and stopped by to let us know it will be out shortly. Hour wait on food was a little to long we had a child and they can barely set still for 10mins let alone over hour waiting on food. Not sure if they was short cooks but it was not extremely busy in the restaurant that's only reason 4stars.",

The chicken was crispy and very flavorful just how I like it! Not only was the experience amazing, but the atmosphere was great. Great music playing but also not too loud, which was great for my brunch date and I. Not only was all this amazing but also had valet parking. So many thumbs up for this place!",

We all can't wait to go back the chicken is what good chicken should be. The sides remind you of a family cookout and are delicious.  Be careful you can become addicted.

We let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).  I did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their \"drinks\" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I\"m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.  I ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.    The Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking.   We were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.    The Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.  We also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.    I will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.  Our waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.  Normally from food alone, this would get a 3, but I want to try a BUNCH more sides that looked awesome, and the service was impeccable. :)",

There was a miscommunication with the host regarding whether our group wanted to be together or separate. We were quoted an hour wait and after an hour and fifteen minutes we asked the hostess for an update. We realized they had grouped us together so we requested to ungroup us and seat us separately as it would be easier for the restaurant.   We waited another 20 minutes and continued to watch other groups being seated. I approached the hostess again to find out the status of our table. The staff had completely ignored our request to not be seated as a group for a second time. This time she said they would have our group of 6 seated as soon as a table became available.   I watched the staff hold off on seating guests as tables contiued to be cleaned off in an attempt to remedy the situation. We waited another 20 minutes to find out they were still trying to seat us as a group. What has happened to listening to the customer? I will be going to Old Town from now on.",

We came about 3pm on a Sunday and had a 10-15 min wait. I loved looking around the restaurant and really liked the red brick inside and out. Also I liked the decor of lights made out of mason jars and TVs around. Waiting was not a problem. Once we were sat we were greeted with a friendly waiter, I think his name was Joseph.   I ordered the catfish and waffle and my wife had the #2 Baby Ray, basically 3 piece chicken meal with 2 waffles with gravy and onions. We also had a side of the Mac n cheese too. All in all I thought the food was outstanding!  Probably best friend chicken I've ever had. I loved it even more with a bite of chicken and waffle at the same time! Simply amazing. The catfish was also equally amazing. Very flakey and fried just right. The waffles were made perfect too and I can't forget about the gravy. Very thick and yummy. Oh and the Mac! I heard that they have mushrooms in the Mac. I'm not a fan if mushrooms but gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Was also great We ended our meal with a taste of the red velvet cake.  But we had to get it to go because we were both so stuffed! But when I did try it, it's didn't disappoint!  Very hearty and I liked the walnuts in it.   All in all I have no idea what took us so long to try Lo-Lo's!!  Now that I know where it's at ill definitely be coming back!",

The restaurant has a cool ambiance, although the music (often by a live DJ) is usually too loud for my preference. I always order a fried chicken breast with waffles. It is seriously so good. The waffles are crispy and the chicken is seasoned well and isn't greasy. The combination of the two with some maple syrup is killer. I've gotten some of the sides before (cornbread, mac'n'cheese, lemonade) and they're yummy, but they add to your bill.  Pros: -Delicious chicken waffles. -Local soul food.  Cons: -Long wait to be seated. Slow service. -Expensive for the portions. -Loud music.",

She hadn't tried it since we had a bad experience in New Orleans but got brave enough to have it here and was very pleased with it. The grits were creamy just like she likes them and the shrimp and sauce were excellent. I hear it gets busy later on in the day but we went for lunch and were seated right away.

I got the Betty Boop, which was a breast and a waffle. My waist line is not thrilled, but I was! The chicken was good, it had a good amount of crunchiness, but I wish the breading had more spices in it. A good way to fix that is using their delicious hot sauce. Surprising, the coffee here was very good as well. I will probably not come here often (my thighs can't afford it), but when I'm looking for a breakfast calorie splurge, this is a good place to go.

I love so many options that you can choose from their menu so practically you can mix and match to whatever you want, fried chicken leg, thigh, breast, or even fried catfish. Also, you can pick many sides from their long list of sides. I had their fried chicken legs and thigh and thought they were well seasoned although I wish they could fry it fresh. My pieces of chicken felt slightly room temperature and maybe they were left out for a while. However, they were still very tasty. Their sides were great too. Definitely try as many of them as possible! I really had a great meal there as I was really craving for fried chicken and southern meals!! The service was great too that really presents southern style of restaurants. Come out and try some authentic southern fried chicken!",

But the staff is friendly and efficient.   On a Sunday afternoon, the wait wasnt too long for a packed restaurant. I kept it simple with just a chicken breast and single waffle. Both of which were fantastic and are more than arguably better that the well known Roscoe's. The chicken is juicy, mildly spicy, crispy and flavorful. I prefer a bit more spice and their hot sauce does the job nicely.   They offer kool aid which is cool, but im not a fan of super sweet drinks So i had a lemonade, lol yeah, thats super sweet as well.

It tasted gross and I look for someone to ask for another glass and there is no one around. Although several other employees passed by, NONE of them look very friendly or asked if we needed help. About five minutes later our food comes. I ask the woman who brought the food to switch out my drink and my dad asked for the coffee he ordered when we sat down. So after being seated for nearly 30 minutes we finally get our drinks. The food was pretty good and we then give our waitress ours cards. Within minutes she's back with our bill. We then ask for a to-go box and a to-go drink. She NEVER comes back with either. We had to as other people for the box and I leave without my drink. On the way out the waitress finally appears and says they \"ran out\" of to-go cups. It doesn't not take 10 minutes to figure that out. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",

    "text": "I hate to say it, but I am finally done with Lo-Lo's.   The first time I ever went there it was wonderful. It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.  I work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.  Regardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success.   Then my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.  Today was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin.   I'm just over it. Now that Welcome Chicken and Donuts opened I'll just go there instead. They always have good service and the chicken is amazing. I'm sad that such a Phoenix staple has gone so down hill.",

    "text": "I first had Lo-Lo's about 7-8 years ago when it looked like a house that had been converted into a restaurant.  The fried chicken was amazing and much better than Roscoe's.  I've revisited several times since and usually stops by whenever I am in Phoenix.  This weekend was no different.  I was delighted to see that I could join the waitlist on Yelp to cut down on actual wait time for a table.  That was a nice touch and a practice that I wish more restaurants would do!  We checked in with the host and about 20 minutes later were seated.  Not too shabby.  My bf and I split the shrimp mac and cheese and the 3 piece fried chicken, waffles, grits, and eggs (Scrambled with cheese and onion).  We also got fruit punch and grape Kool-aid because that's what you do when Kool-aid is on tap!  The shrimp mac and cheese came with a biscuit.  There's a decent amount of shrimp and bacon in the dish but it was extremely greasy.  I mean I understand that mac and cheese is not a light dish, however, the amount of bacon grease allowed in the dish was ridiculous.  The fried chicken and waffles were good but nothing memorable like that first visit.  The scrambled eggs were overcooked and became rubbery.  I much prefer the scrambled eggs from Roscoe's.  The grape Koll-aid was better than the fruit punch flavor as all we could taste was sugar.    As for service, our waitress was sweet but did not remember our request at all.  I asked for a plate and ketchup and she disappeared.  When she did come back, I had to remind her of my request.  She then disappeared again for about 15 minutes before she came back with the plate and ketchup.  I saw her fingers accidentally came into contact with the ketchup but she played it off and gave it to me anyway.  She had to wipe her fingers (directly in front of us) right after.  Hmm, no thanks.  Overall, I no longer feel that Lo-Lo's is shoulders above Roscoe's.  It's serviceable if you're in the mood for fried chicken and Kool-aid whenever you're in the area but definitely not a must-eat destination!",

    "text": "I came across this place a few times when looking for a good place to eat. It had decent reviews.   My friend even came here and said there was no AC he couldn't enjoy his food. He also said, \"it's no Roscoe's.\" But for me, I don't think  Roscoe's is all that great.   The AC part turned me off first time when I stumbled across this place. Second time, I had a pup with me. So being it was cooler than other days I've been in Phoenix, I didn't mind being on the patio.   I thought it was kind of weird that there were only approximately four tables outside and almost each table had their own server. Weird, but it didn't bother me because everyone that walked by was very helpful and willing to help or find my waitress.  On to the food, I got a soul food platter with fried chicken (two drumsticks and a thigh), mac and cheese, collared greens, cornbread and a waffle.   The chicken was a bit dry, all the sides were ok. My gf really enjoyed the mac and cheese.   My favorite thing was the waffle covered in butter. Their hot sauce was some of the best I've had at a fried chicken place.   I didn't enjoy any of their drinks as they were too sweet.  BTW Andy, they have AC inside now!",

The food seemed better the service was definitely better as well.  I do love to see a business grow and expand, but there is a certain love for those smaller spots. The expanded location is beautiful and the menu extended with nice cocktails.  They waffles are literally the best I have had, but the mac & cheese is hit or miss. Too gooey, too dry or too bland. Maybe 2/10 times it is on point. Also one of the few that serve turkey bacon.",

    "text": "We brought a friend from Atlanta to enjoy some \"real southern home cookin'\" . He loved it! For his dinner he chose the biscuits and gravy and sweet tea, of course. Huge portions, thick chunky delicious, a bit spicy, gravy on large homemade biscuits. He was not disappointed with the perfect service, attentive staff (Shawanda), and awesome food. I got the smothered chicken tenders that had a little bit of spice to the gravy, fried okra (always done to perfection), and whipped potatoes (mashed potatoes with gravy whipped in). Hubby enjoyed 3 perfectly pieces of fried chicken, okra and outstanding cheesy grits!  Tip: The tea is best if you get 1/2 & 1/2 since the sweet is really sweet. The wait for us on a Saturday night, 5:30 pm was exactly 20 minutes, which is what they estimated at time of check in. The handy texting when table is ready makes it worry free that you won't be missing your name being called and keeps our anonymity.    This is always a favorite stop after going to the top of South Mountain after a sunset.  Restrooms are roomy and clean. Decor is simple and clean.  Expect to be yelling at each other the whole time you're there due to the loud music.  Pay at the table with the server, which is always a nice customer service thing.  I'd recommend LoLo's Chicken & Waffles to anyone who want an honestly good meal!",

    "text": "Hubby and I were in town for spring training again and decided to treat ourselves to some chicken and waffles before we headed over to the ballpark.  We'd been here once before - not sure why I didn't review it before.  However, this time around, I resolved to write something when we got home.  The cool thing is you can now get a waitlist via Yelp.  Yay!  It was semi-accurate-ish.  The wait range was 1-11minutes.  However, upon walking in, it took a while for the hostess to come back. When she did, she checked us in and that's when our wait starts.  Thankfully, it was about 10 minutes.  We were seated outside which was pleasant enough.  Our server turned out to be a ray of sunshine - super polite and accommodating.  She was on top of her game - didn't forget a single thing and check in on us regularly.  Now to the food...definitely better than that chain-that-shall-not-be-named in LA, history be damned.  The food here tasted and smelled great.  Both hubby and I each ordered the Soul Food Platter and both got the smothered chicken (with gravy and onions).  He got buttered rice and coleslaw while I got the grits, a waffle and an extra side of two eggs. Everything hit the spot.  The waffle was amazing but I had to stop at half.  I ended up covering my grits with my over-medium eggs and dousing it with hot sauce - divine!  To start, we also got the catfish nuggets which were good...until you made use of Lolo's hot sauce and it just totally got kicked up a notch.  The meal really hit the spot and set us up for the rest of the day until dinner time.    Only questionable things were how slowly the hostess moved and also some of the stuff needed cleaning...it was disconcerting that both hubby and my menu pages were all stuck together.  I guess that's the hazard of having syrup in your repertoire!",

    "text": "Okay, for years I wondered what the fuss was about Lo-Lo's and always thought it was too $$ for just some chicken and waffles (i think at one point in the past i made comments to people about getting some KFC and eggos for less).  The husband had had it a few times, and had told me that the chicken was amazing.  Still it took me over 10 years to try them out.    I decided to order and have it delivered using one of \"those\" apps.  I ordered C the Tre-Tre. Husband got the Puffs chicken tenders basket. I got the Lil Amadi. Also ordered a side of fried okra and mac & cheese.   We got our order delivered.    And...I took everything back about it being just \"some chicken and waffles\"!  The chicken. OMG. SO Freaking good!! Huge crunch factor to the skin. Meat was not dry. Just thinking about it now makes me want to pass over my lunch i brought to work and order some Lo-Los (it's right down the street from work).   My only slight complaint would be about the okra.  There were a lot of pieces that were very very woody and inedible. other than that...everything was amazing!    Looking forward to getting Lo-Lo's again..maybe today.  LOL",

I would also add that in most places the bathroom stalls have reviews for slutty women, this place has reviews of their food. That should say a lot.   I definitely will be coming back.",

Great vibe and very modern but comfortable. We were assigned to a booth at the front next to the sidewalk- it wasn't too full yet. Our waitress took our order, I ordered the biscuits & gravy platter, my family ordered the red velvet pancakes, the scramble skillet, a cheeseburger and a 3 pc chicken with mashed potatoes & fries.  The wait for the food was a bit long but it came hot. Big portions, very tasty. For me the sausage gravy was a bit sweet- like if too much evaporated milk was added- the biscuits were big- mine were a tad bit dry. I needed more gravy for the biscuits so I ordered a side of it. The red velvet pancakes were delicious and moist- the syrup not too sweet. The mashed potatoes were delicious as was the chicken- or so my son said. My favorite was the country potatoes that were served with my biscuits & gravy! They were awesomely seasoned and cooked to a gentle crispiness- so good.  It got really busy from 10am on- but the staff were always smiling and provided good service.   Very nice place, food was good, a little pricey but they give you big portions. I will definitely return.",

We sat down our waitress came over right away I got sweet tea and my son got grape cool-aid. We both ordered the puffs chicken basket with a waffle. And my daughter got the kids Mac & cheese. And I got an app of fried green tomatoes. You can't find those anywhere. Hands down this was the best chicken and waffles I've ever had and I used to go to the legendary Roscoes chicken and waffles. Lo-Lo's is 100% way way better even my son who is the picky eater said so. That chicken was just juicy and full of flavor the waffle was light and fluffy. Duh we tired the Mac and cheese we each had a bite it was sooo goooey and cheese yes my little 18m old ate half a bowl of it. Lol I can't wait to come back here it's worth the drive.",

It has orange juice, lime, and another fruit juice, and rye whiskey. I liked it because it had a great balance of mixer and whiskey (whiskey forward). I also enjoy the Lolos (3 pieces of chicken with two waffles) added in collard greens. The chicken is fried nicely with not too much batter ( less guilty feel). The waffles have a taste of cinnamon and vanilla. The house made syrup is perfect for the waffle.   Our waitress (Alyssa) was very attentive. Drinks on time, water never empty, and the food was timely and hot. She was very friendly as well.   As long as these are my memories of Lolos i will continue to stop when in town!",

The chicken was DELICIOUS!! Tender and juicy on the inside, crispy and crunchy on the outside with just the right balance of fried goodness to chicken and good seasoning.  The waffles were tasty with a hint of cinnamon in the batter, they were crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. Just the way I like 'em!  So glad we found this place!

It almost taste like it was just sitting under a light. The waffles was fluffy taste like air. When pouring syrup on them it just soaked it right on up.  I ordered a soul food plate....catfish, Mac & cheese, greens and cornbread.  The catfish was fried hard. No seasoning. The Mac and cheese was kraft nothing homemade about it. The greens were sour taste like jalapeno pepper juice was on them.  The cornbread had corn in it which was gross.  My fiance ordered a special lemonade. There was nothing special about it country time lemonade mixed with tap water.  For that food to be priced at that point I just knew it was going to be good.  Save your money and time.",

There was a 30-45 minute wait to begin with which was fine because I heard this place was the business.  Service was mediocre - waitress half-fast any questions had, after bringing the food never came back until it was time to pay the bill. It was at that time she realized she forgot to bring out the side of green beans that came with my meal so she brought it out \"to go\". As for the food it did not look that great. Almost like trying to prevent waste so deep fried a previous order to heat it back up and slop gravy on it. It was crunchy rather than crispy. Mashed potatoes and gravy warm not hot, corn bread was dark but cold - the butter didn't even melt.",

    "text": "The hype for this place was off the wall!! \"It's better than Roscoe's\" \"They're chicken is soooooo goooood!\" and so on and so on, so whilst on vacation I made my first visit along with the hubby and some family. While I've never had Roscoe's to make the comparison, I have had The Breakfast Klub in Houston and DIED over their delicious chicken, waffles and grits so I was looking to be just as wowed.   All I can say is, it was all hype. Sorry!!! I know Arizonians everywhere just fell out of their chairs!! It just wasn't amazing, or even kind of good, it was just OK.   We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The service was good, we beat the Sunday church crowd so it wasnt overly packed but I was kind of shocked at the size of place, pretty cramped but I guess I'll give it cozy.   So we order, I love that the drinks come in HUGE mason jars (not so good for those wasted calories on SUGARY drinks) and get the chicken breast and wing with a waffle and a side of grits. Boooo!!!!! My grits were soup, I had to season them well to get some flavor and despite letting them sit for a little to see if they'd solidify. . . .no go. I was sooooo dissappointed.   Moving onto the main dish, I dont love chicken skin but I understand the allure in the fried variety so I indulge from time to time. This time I went for it and tasted. . . .salt. Lots of salt. Double booooo!!! The breading was fine, not to thick or gummy when it hit the syrup but still too salty for me. So fried skin removed, chicken doused in hot sauce, I enjoyed the remainder of my dish and ordinary waffle and was thoroughly full but not too satisfied.   Overall, Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was just that, chicken and waffles and nothing to spectacular at that. 3 stars for being an ok chicken & waffles joint with good service and decent prices.",

    "text": "I really like LoLo's.  They have very good food.  I can easily say that everything I've ever ordered at LoLo's has been delicious.  The sweet tea is as advertised.  When ordering the Kool Aid, I usually order it as half water, half Kool Aid as to not slip into a diabetic coma.  The prices are on par as far as soul food places go.  I do not mind waiting for good food, so I won't score negatively on that.  The wait staff is pretty attentive as far as the usual wait service goes.  I only have one complaint.  There have been a couple of times when there were a couple of unruly, obnoxiously loud (maybe even ungodly loud) people there while I was dining with my wife and 2 daughters.  They were using expletives and using language that had graphic sexual undertones.  Mind you, this was at a volume that was loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The wait staff and management didn't even bother to ask them to simmer down and have some respect for the other patrons.    I've always had really good dining experiences at LoLo's.  The staff is friendly, other than a couple of incidents, the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere.  Other than the two times I mentioned, I thought this was a really good family restaurant.  I really do wish when incidents like this occur, that the wait staff or management steps up and ensures that a couple of people don't ruin the dining experience of everyone in the restaurant.  I am no stranger to eating in a loud restaurant where the level of noise is very high due to everyone having normal conversations.  The two times that I was unfortunate enough to go through this has actually kept me from going back.  There's no doubt I'll go there again.  I will crave their fried chicken and catfish enough to cross my fingers and give it another try.  It's just too bad that now, I can't trust the restaurant enough to bring my daughters there.",

We decided to stop in for lunch on our day off. we were told our wait would be 10-15 min not even sitting down 5 min we were told our table was ready. We walk to the back (chick'n coop) only to be told our table was not ready. So I sat down in the chair just outside the chick'n coop door only be to be told by the rude hostess (a Hispanic lady) that I could not sit and wait there I needed to go sit down in the front. As go sit in the front as I was told not even 50 seconds later I'm told you're tables ready. My husband had gone to the bathroom and I told the rude hostess I would wait for my husband to walk out of the bathroom before being seated so we could sit down in the chick'n coop together. The look she gave me said I was not supposed to do that. But I did anyways. We were seated and our waiter Steve I believe was his name came and got our drink order & after awhile our food order. I ordered the catfish my husband ordered the chicken & waffles. I asked for lemons for my catfish Steve never brought them to me I had to ask a table busser to bring me some. Steve came & refilled my husbands drink I still had some in my cup but by the time I was done Steve never came back another random gentlemen I think he was also a busser because I had seen him sweeping & cleaning off a table earlier. Offered to get me a refill, we revived our check & to go cups and left. The service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes. The food was amazing I would only choose to go back for  he food. Not for the people. Maybe they will bone up on there service skills & people skills. The food I give 10 stars.",

I'm not sure if they even have other items on the menu as I've always just had chicken and waffles. I've had Lo-Los to go and eaten on-site numerous times. If you eat in, they serve the drinks in mason jars, and the overly-attentive wait staff never leave you with less than a half-full jar before offering you a refill.   The fried chicken is the best I've ever had period! It's even better than the stalwart California chain and institution, Roscoes. The other day I had fried chicken at home and found myself putting Frank's Red Hot and syrup over it before I deemed it worthy to eat. Lo-Los made me do that.",

I even did a tough 2.5 mile hike to Piestewa Peak afterwards, and it still wasn't enough to burn off all that food.    I ordered the #1 (KK's) - the chicken and waffles were both pretty good, but both fell short of Roscoe's here in LA. The chicken was a bit dry and just didn't have enough flavor and the waffles didn't have that hint of cinnamon that Roscoe's has. The grits were good and I really enjoyed the scrambled eggs with cheese and onions... just wish they gave more than two bites of it.  I initially didn't like their gravy, but I grew into it as I continued to eat. It was sweeter than I was used to, but it went well with the food.  Not a bad choice if you're in the area, but I'm afraid I'll have to give the edge to my hometown version.",

The restaurant itself is small and seating is tight and compact, so large groups don't feel so welcome. The host initially took awhile to seat us but other than that the service was great.   The food was good but not as wonderful as I expected, so claims of the fried chicken here being the best are exaggerated and the food was overpriced considering our surroundings (come-on the spot needs to be renovated and its located in a beat down area of Central Phoenix).   Overall the service and food were what you'd expect from any regular ordinary spot, there was nothing overly great about either the food or the service.",

The chicken was nothing like it used to be.  We made the mistake of coming late, so there was nothing but chicken and waffles available.  No catfish or greens.  They have drinks, but only from their short drink menu.  The old LoLo's was always worth a special trip, but sadly the new incarnation doesn't live up to expectations.",

They now refuse to take a cash order over the phone (mind you we are in an office ordering for a dozen people all who have cash). Their customer treatment is very poor and at times downright aggressive. The parking lot is valet only so you are forced to park somewhere in the neighborhood behind the building and walk or pay up. I would strongly recommend to pass them by if you are in the area and support the new Welcome Chicken and Donut that is right down the street. You will pay just about the same, the quality of food will be better and the treatment you receive will be a world apart from the sad franchise Lolo's has now become.",

The waffles are hands down the best I have had in the Valley. My mother will also be excited to know I will even eat the okra at Lo-Lo's (it's fried). Their sweet tea is also amazing, and everytime I go I wish I had a brought a jug with me so I could have them fill it up and take it home.  Improvements they have made over the last few years include an additional add-on to the restaurant (a converted house) for more seating, as well as some signage off of Central so you don't miss the turn onto Yuma Street.   For first timers concerned about the neighborhood and/or what some believe to be the strange combination of chicken & waffles -- JUST GO. I have been to Lo-Lo's at lunchtime as well as late at night and never had an issue. To the chicken & waffle non-believers - try it once and you will get it.",

Then when the waiter is informed allowing us to speak with the manager about the service, he brings a dude of non intimidation to inform us that \"we cannot do any adjustments to the bill, was food hot?, and did you eat?\"   WOW... what type of customer service are you representing? So since this was my idea to invite the coworkers, I will pick a restaurant that appreciates their customers as patrons'.   Regards,  County Employees",

I had the 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. I chose the mac n' cheese and sweet potatoes. Everything was amazing. No. Make that \"a-MAH-zing\". The chicken was cooked perfectly--tender and juicy with a crispy coating that had a nice \"pop\" of seasoning. The mac n' cheese actually had cheesy flavor. All too often, restaurant mac n' cheese leaves me wondering \"where's the cheese?\" Not so at Lo-Lo's. The only (only!) complaint I have is the portion size. It was WAY TOO MUCH!  I wish they had a two piece/two side combo, or even a one piece combo. As much as I like fried chicken, I'm really a sucker for the sides. Lo-Lo's does both very very well.",

Couple came in and  seated several rows from me, waiter brought food to a table close, checked on another table, proceeded to greet and take drink orders for that couple. Immediately upset, got up to walk out as he appeared to make it over to my table finally, unacceptable. No apology, nothing, just stood back and watched me walk away. Dear Sir, travel nurse here that all meals are paid for tax free. I usually order a drink, meal, extra sides, possible second meal for lunch the next day and if I have room a dessert.

I had the Betty Boop which is 1 breast and 1 waffle.  The hubs had Sheedah's Special - a breast a wing and a waffle.   Since I've never had chicken AND waffles before I had no basis for comparison.  The chicken was a little on the dry side but I really liked the flavor.  The first bites of the waffle kinda reminded me of a frozen waffle but I quickly got past that with the cinnamon, buttery flavors. The iced tea was super good and I love that they serve them in Kerr jars so we didn't require any refills.  Oh!  I almost forgot the grits... because they're forgettable.  I've lived in the south and grits never grew on me.  It's been so long since I tried them and the reviews were stellar; I thought I'd give them a second chance.  I'm sorry grits but if that much butter and cheese can't make you taste good, nothing can.  The service was excellent.  Very quick.  Everyone was pleasant except for the hostess.  When we told the server it was our first time there she gave us a free piece of red velvet cake.  Very moist with a cream cheese frosting and walnuts on top.",

That's me right now, only with WAY better hair. Had the #10.  Because I'm a 10, get it?  Two chicken legs with a waffle.  I went with Julia T., Jason W., Nathan S., Amanda B., and David SB tonight.  We all ordered different sides so we could share.  Our end of the table shared the collard greens , mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes. The platter of chicken and waffles arrived.  You should see the scoop of butter on the waffle!  A scoop!  Not a pat!  The chicken legs were perfectly done - moist, not greasy, with an awesome coating that wasn't too much.  The waffle was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'm glad it came with syrup, not maple syrup.  I detest maple anything.  I lived in New England too long. Nathan leaned over and suggested we pretend we were making an Ice Cube movie, Babershop-style, and pick an actor to play each of us.  I was Angela Bassett, of course.   Collard green were yummy!  Not over-cooked, with hunks of the stems thrown in.  The sweet potatoes were pretty sweet, but not overly so.  Mac and cheese?  Yes, please! (that rhymed!)  And the tea.  Ohhhhhh the tea.  I got the half and half sweet.  I figured there was enough sugar in my meal that I didn't want to bounce off the walls and crash like a 4-year old after Halloween.  I had two huge glasses - actually, jars.  It's served in Kerr canning jars.  The big ones.  It was so good (How good was it???) that as I got up from my corner seat and walked around to leave, I reached over to take one last huge swig.   I'm full.  Not Thanksgiving-dinner full, but properly sated after a meal at LoLo's.   The company rocked and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant dinner crowd!   (p.s. We pegged Whoopie to play Julia.  Ha!)",

    "text": "Oh. My. God.  How have I never been to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles after 8 years in the Valley? Shame on all of my friends for waiting so long to take me to this hidden gem!!  Think fried chicken with your breakfast of waffles, eggs, and cheese grits sounds gross?  Well you have never been more wrong my friend!  I don't quite know how, but it was oh so right.  And I am not a big meat with my eggs fan (i.e. steak and eggs) fan in general so no one was more surprised than me when I was left craving some more of that delicious fried perfection after Brad E was kind enough to share some of his with me.  The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.  I ordered WAY too much food for myself (shocker) so I didn't even get to sample the mac and cheese, corn, and other incredibly enticing side dishes that were scattered about my table.  Yes, the place is kind of cramped and you'll wait longer than you want for your food, but deal with it, you'll be thrilled you did.",

Visualize yourself shitfaced at the end of the night, stopping for a bucket of KFC because nothing could ever taste better than food when you're that drunk.  You with me?  LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.  Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.  Alternatives: mac and cheese  The waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling.",

    "text": "I cried.  I pushed the passenger car seat back, unbuttoned my jeans and if I could have unbuttoned my skin, I would have. We had an emergency stop at Wal-Greens for Lactaid, Tums, Bean-O, and Ginger Ale. I even made my bf buy this hideous stained glass candle holder (at WAL-GREENS) cause I thought it was \"cute\"-that is how out of my mind w/pain I was. I laid down on the bed and asked for a barf bucket. Just in Case. And did you see what I gave this place? Yeah. Five muthaf'n stars. Don't be a pussy.   I racked my brain all day, trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry. We needed a place that at 8:30 on a Friday gonna be open and not insane. He is a down home, steak and taters guy, and I am a nervous nelly sophisticate whose lactose intolerance and mostly vegetarian tummy stumps restaurants . And I was hungry after a long day of work. I looked up the menu at work and saw they serve b-fest all day. Oh good, this way I could avoid all the meat, get the waffle, and avoid all \"oh, you don't like meat\" conversation I hate.  Easy enough to find (take the 60 to 17 if you can to avoid Light Rail hell from the 10), we found parking on the street and walked right into the restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign with a mighty Sassy Chicken on front! We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place.   I looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.  We all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.  \"This waffle is good.\"  \"Yes, it is\"  \"Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.\"  five minutes later  \"This waffle is really, really good.\"  ten minutes later  \"I can't believe how perfect this waffle is\"  It was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.  I could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.  We really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret.   Our guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!",

The portions are pretty decent for its price. The service was great...the workers always came by to check on us.",

Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go.   Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it.   That or I was just too hungry to function properly.  But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!  Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance.   Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.  Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.  And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.  Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment.   But on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak.",

We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra.  I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah....  We were checked on several times to see if we needed anything and we were treated cordially. I will visit LoLo's any time, any day as long as someone is there to share the guilt with me!",

We had a very long wait (which told us it must be pretty good!), but the kind people of Lo-Lo's were kind enough to provide us with a shade structure and mister-fan to combat some of that infamous Phoenix heat. They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.  The food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well! I felt like my meal cost a little more than I would have hoped, for just a piece of chicken and a waffle. It's worth going there, though, for the experience.",

    "text": "WHOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!! that's some damned good fried chicken!  hahaha!! Forreally for real though... Ugh.... *Insert Homer Simpson-esque gargling sound here!*   My cousin and I were spent the weekend being hermits and I got tired of it and offered her some LoLo's, never one to turn down a free meal, she happily said yes. We brought my mom along and were Lo-Lo's bound.  When we got there I saw the lil tent and mini bar of doom. I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era...   We were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules.   Our waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good...   and then the food arrived...  It was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle.   We were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!  There was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl....   \"DON'T EVEN think about it!\" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts  DANG!   I reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven.   I know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha....   Meanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)  We were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...  So simple, so devine. So yummy, so Lo-Lo's.",

    "text": "I woke up an hour later in the passenger seat of my own car, my window plastered with puckerings of chicken-greased flavored lipstick.   Apparently, we had met up with Erica O for lunch at Lo Lo's. We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a \"Toy Toy\" and a \"Betty Boop\" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.  I was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in \"served as one entity\". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.  I had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.  They had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.  The food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a \"food coma\" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.  The story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes. I was tempted to call Erica O and cross-reference Misty S' account with one of her own, but we were in the parking lot of Arrowhead mall and I needed a new pair of shoes. Or two.",

The breading is light, crispy, and tastey.  The waffles are somehow soft and crispy at the same time and they have a bit of sweetness to them.  Again, I will only eat waffles at Lo-Lo's as everywhere else is a huge disappointment.  The only reason I am giving Lo-Lo's four stars instead of five is the price.  When I look over the menu, the prices seem completely reasonable, but by the time the bill comes I feel like I've spent way more money than for the food I received.",

This is not my usual fare, but for that meal once in awhile that is just about enjoying comfort food without a thought of nutritional value, I'd definitely come back.  I enjoyed the chicken breast, it was fried to perfection and not too greasy.  The waffle was the perfect complement.  I tasted my friend's tea, which was diluted in half and it was still way too sweet.  I am just not used to that much sugar.  Everything else was just as I expected, and it satisfied the half of my DNA that prides itself on its Southern roots.    If you're overly concerned about health and don't have it in you to once in awhile just go eat something for the taste, please don't go here.   Your whining will distract me from enjoying my meal.   If you \"get\" that once in awhile a meal like this is perfectly fine, come on over to my table.  We'll share a few sides and enjoy some Southern comfort together!",

The fried chicken is the best around, coupled with the waffles...and then I usually add grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions, side of bacon, side of mac n' cheese...and wash it down with some tasty red koolaid in a mason jar.  The red velvet cake is a MUST for dessert...order it to go if you are too full, it's SO good!  They do have a newer location in Scottsdale that his much bigger, but it just isn't quite the same as the original Phoenix location.  If you are going for lunch, get there early(like 11:30 or earlier), otherwise you will be waiting in line outside the place for a long time.",

Excellent fried chicken, the sides were dirty rice & red potatoes/green beans. Both excellent -- and not too Scottsdale-ish at all. Example: when ordering green beans in a soul food place I WANT canned beans that are gussied up w/butter & bacon not some kind of certified organic locally grown GMO free super-beans. The cornbread muffin made fresh and you're not going to get those around here like that. Atmosphere busy, urban & clean. Waitstaff was hopping absolutely nobody hanging around texting or socializing because the place is so busy. Yes there's valet parking or around the block but honestly you kinda need a walk after a lunch like this.",

    "text": "Ok, so the idea of eating chicken and waffles never has appealed to me.  It just seemed wrong, like i was violating a law of some kind.  But my friend invited me to go to Lo-Lo's for lunch and I gave in.  Boy, was I wrong about how it would taste!  There is something about the flavors that just work great together.  If you have never tried it, I recommend it.    We went to the Phoenix location, and it was very busy at lunch time, so get there early or you will probably have a wait.  The service was friendly, with lots of smiles, which made me feel at home.  I had chicken and waffles, corn bread, and mac-n-cheese.  The chicken can come with gravy, which makes it messy to eat, but mmmmmmm...get the gravy.  The corn bread is very good too.    My only complaint is that the waffle was on the thin side, but was still a great flavor to add to the fried chicken.  They have a large menu of classic soul food items, so there is a lot to choose from.  I went there about three weeks ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about chicken and waffles since, so i know I will be going back soon, and will buy one of their t-shirts too.",

    "text": "Fist and last time LoLo's will get another dime of my hard earned money !! The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter \"Carlos\" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star).  The problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience: 1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait). 2). Oder taken within 15-20 min. 3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat). 4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice. 5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us). 6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us) 7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response \"This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals\" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) ! 8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish). ***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!  Otherwise spend your money somewhere else where they \"Thank you for coming\" !",

I've had the misfortune of a bad experience out in their Scottsdale location, but when I had a girlfriend in town who had just been craving fried chicken, well. There's really not any other place in Phoenix to go to. Except Mrs. White's. And they weren't open late enough.  I didn't know what to expect. I knew that the food would probably be good. That it was in a ghetto part of town. Not to be on a diet before I got here. The basics.   I was really quite impressed. They had clearly renovated recently. It's bright and stylish and modern. Very busy, and quite loud, thanks to the crowd of people and aforementioned DJ. The food is straight up soul food fare- chicken and waffles, beans and rice, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. You can get kool aid or lemonade or sweet tea in giant mason jars. The food came out quickly, but was piping hot and fresh. (Unlike our experience with the other location.) My chicken had beautifully crispy skin. My grits were okay. A bit thick and gooshy, but really the star of the show here is the chicken, so frankly I didn't care too much that the sides were a little more mediocre.   We were so stuffed to the gills at the end we had no room for red velvet cake or any of the tempting sweets. Till next time, Lo-lo's. Till next time.",

I had no idea chicken and waffles were such a good combination until I went to Lo-lo's, so now my standards for chicken and waffles are really high! Haha!  Everything from the atmosphere to their coffee to the service was awesome. Minor slight was that they did not serve decaf coffee, but no big deal. I ordered a waffle with two drumsticks and both were cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good sized waffle too, and the chicken just compliments it so well. Even the syrup on the waffle was delicious. My dad ordered bacon and eggs and he said they were cooked just the way he wanted them. Only other minor slight was that the dishes are commonly served with a side of grits and you can't substitute it for fruit or a biscuit. Still, not big enough of a deal to detract from the overall experience.  The waitresses were all so nice. They came around and refilled out coffee and waters promptly, made sure the food tested well, they even put on the Steelers game on the TV that was close to our table, which we appreciated. And the cold drinks get served in Mason jars, which is so cute. I love it when restaurants do that.  It can crowded, especially during brunch/lunch hours. My family and I went when it first opened at 9 a.m. By the time we left around 10:30, there was a line out the door for lunch. If you go for lunch, get there around 10. But even if you get there late, it's definitely worth the wait. Lo-Lo's is hands down one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix.",

There are TVs to watch a game and the brick walls are filled with great art and photo's.    We had Edith as our server; she was just a doll and we had no issues with her.    We had the Ka Ka Platter & it was yum-o.  Grits were ok but the eggs were fabulous as was the moist but not greasy chicken.  I had a Bre Bre salad and that was equally delicious.    If you like banana's, the banana pudding is a MUST.  It is freaking good!!!!",

It may have just been that batch of chicken that was overcooked, but I wouldn't get the fried chicken again. We also got the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and that was wonderful. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the gravy had an amazing flavor and the mashed potatoes were phenomenal. I'd highly recommend getting that.",

I love the food quality/freshness at both this location and the Scottsdale location BUT I just personally like the vibe at the Central location better. It's more relaxed; the servers are attentive but distant (super friendly), which I prefer when dining out. They always remember us and welcome us back. Scottsdale location is cool, but the staff seems very strained, like they're uncomfortable almost. Weird vibe, still love going regardless. But if you're in town (downtown)and want to try Lo-Lo's I highly recommend visiting the Central location. Try the home fries and/or biscuits & gravy if you're not big on chicken and waffles. Tip: Order your drink in a to-go cup, so you can take your Kool-Aid with you :)",

He took the bowl to the kitchen, when he returned he told me that it was a gum wrapper. I replied how did a gum wrapper get in the mac n cheese, he said that's what my managed wanted me to ask you. I said WOW, I did not/ was not chewing gum. The manager did not even come to the table to see what the issue was, and all they did to correct the situation was offer another mac n cheese or remove it from the bill.

It seems they are under-staffed, but they don't have a hiring sign hung up so they must be okay with it. Food is outstanding but just be prepared for anything when it comes to the service.

We were a party of 6 and it took an hour to be seated, after they said it would take 30-40 minutes.  The waiter was good (Deion), but it took too long for the food to arrive.  However, overall, the food was OK - I had the fried Catfish which was good but the side of rice with gravy had no taste and my other side was fries and I think  they gave me about 10 fries, that were, just OK.  Lemonade was ok.  I sampled other plates at our table and the fried chicken was very good, actually better than the fried catfish.  The fried gizzards, tasteless but macaroni and cheese was very good.  Since this was my first time, I know now what to order and what not to order next time I come.  Fried Chicken - Very good Macaroni and Cheese- Very good Fried Catfish  - Good Fried Green beans - Ok French Fries - Ok Rice and gravy - Not good, tasteless Fried gizzard - Not good, tasteless Cornbread - if you like cornbread that taste like cake then you will like it but it was too sweet for me",

Our server was busy attending to her other tables....the other lazy severs just stood there talking to each other.  Do not go to this location!  What a disappointment!!

Look we WERE outside and and I know dust and dirt fly and will settle but the table was FILTHY! There was marks from previous cups, and food. FINALY someone came out and did a half a**Ed job of wiping, I had to ask him back as he hurried away so fast cause he missed my spot completely. The photos are AFTER he wiped the table and I AND MY HUSBAND HAD TO USE OUR NAPKINS to still wipe...and the food and dirt I scrubbed off. Needless to say we stuck to drinks as I was too worried to eat at our table",

I don't like the idea of chicken and waffles, but that by no means affects my rating of the place, because they have plenty of combinations if you're put off by one thing or another.  I thought their chicken was pretty good.  I can't bad mouth the portion sizes, either.  I can't say I was ever impressed with the service though.

When I got there at 11 am there was an hour wait, I expected that no big deal, and was told by the friendly staff that I can wait outside on the patio if I would like to wait.  Well I walk through the dining area to find at least 4 tables empty and ALL of the outside tables empty!  If you have an hour wait, why are the tables empty? I am assuming they were short staffed but still unacceptable for a place that always has a wait.  After waiting a little over an hour, we get our table.  We literally order our food once we sit down from our waiter Chris.  Chris was really nice and stopped by from time to time to check on us but it took 45 minutes to get our food - just unacceptable.  We literally ordered CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ONLY!  There were no added items, no speacialty items, just the norm.  Also, I noticed there were three tables that sat down after me and got there food before me.  I personally LOVE there food and thus the reason I brought a friend of mine here to eat but waiting 2 hours to eat chicken and waffles is crazy.   I hope that they really work on staffing!",

Remember this is not diet food so if you expect that and then provide a poor review...shame on you. This is good old fashioned comfort food and did not disappoint. The fried chicken was some of the best we have ever had and the sides were plentiful and very tasty. The gravy with onions was pretty amazing too. My wife really enjoyed the homemade lemonade and I indulged in the grape Kool Aid which was like being a kid again.   We ended up bringing home plenty of leftovers and had to bring home a slice of the Red Velvet cake. The cake was very moist and not too sweet which was a pleasant surprise and nice finish to our evening.",

Anyway, this place I think it's much better than Roscoe's.  The chicken is much more tender, but the amount of crisp is just right and not as greasy as Roscos.  6/7 girls preferred Lolo's.  Service is interesting, they were friendly in their unique way.  The menus and posters crack me up.  The beverage menu says \"a jar of drank\" for $2.50.   Hehe I couldn't help but giggle...too cute.  Cliff's Note:  Food:  4 STARS Avg Price $11-13 a plate Service:  3 STARS  Ordered: Lolo's plate made the traditional southern way.  3 chickens, 2 waffles.

    "text": "In town visiting family (August 19, 2016) and they recommended this restaurant.  As usual, before I headed over I took a moment to read the Yelp reviews.  How in the world does this place get such good reviews?    We were a party of three adults and a baby and were told the wait was going to be 15-25 minutes. A party of 12 came in after us and were seated before us. Our wait was the full 25 minutes.   The woman at the front desk asked for a name to call when it time to be seated.  I said \"Darian.\" She repeated back Victoria. Umm no Darian, she laughed and said not even close huh.  She called out Dirk when it was time to be seated. If they turned the music down just a little bit (not too much because I loved whatever station they were playing) they could possibly hear their customers a little better.  The front desk person was wearing a t shirt that read \"Ghetto Fabulous\" on it.  Ghetto, for sure, fabulous was still something to be seen.  The food - Overrated and way too salty - so salty you can see the salt simply sitting on the Stupid fry.  My son loved the catfish sandwich and my daughter was sick from the tre-tre (two drumsticks and a waffle) less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  Serving the drinks in various sized mason jars was a creative touch - mixing all of the alcoholic drinks with Kool Aid is once again ghetto.  The drinks are super strong (maybe because they are mixed with Kool Aid?) I didn't have the waffle but just looking at it, I wasn't impressed.  The service -Lots of Lo Lo staff simply walking around aimlessly, chatting with the folks at the front door, walking in and out from the patio area, cackling it up with each other, not doing much of anything really.  I will say that our server is what made me give this review two whole stars.  She did a good job and you could tell (besides her telling us) that she was very busy.  She took our drink order and told us that she is also our bartender, so please bear with her but she will be back as soon as she can.  She brought the drinks and 20 minutes later came back with water and finally took our food order.  Same long wait followed by what appeared to be sincere apologies when we asked for more napkins and a take out box. She was very accommodating. Turns out she was also our cashier. Her name was Shamreya.   I ended up giving her the full tip that was \"suggested\" on the bottom of the receipt out of pity, quite honestly.  Parking - one word - SUCKED  Besides getting sick, my kids (young adults themselves) actually liked this place - maybe because it appeared as if it was managed by young adults.  Looks like this restaurant stays pretty busy so they won't notice that I will not be eating here again.",

The site suggested Lo-Lo's, and Yelpers agreed. We didn't have to make a major detour off the freeway.  We parked on the street and entered a modest restaurant with bars on the window. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=KUUUNkwR7yzcX2o38AYTQQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a> No biggie. We received a warm welcome and got friendly service.  We ordered:  * 2 waffles with 3 pieces of chicken - I liked the waffles a lot. I still am not sure I \"get\" chicken with waffles, but I'm testing it out. I liked the chicken, but wasn't completely blown away by it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=3fY_2vL-zR4xXiKuhDjRgA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a> * 1 plain waffle for our 5-year-old - Thumbs up from the kid. * Grits - Lumpy and plain, but still nice in a simple carb sort of way. As a California girl, I know almost nothing about grits.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=UP5-xhOoSN3C3JLURcrXJA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a> * Chili and corn muffin - The chili was made with beans and beef, and was delicious. The corn muffin seemed pretty dry - waffles are way better here. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=PojMqwuCAdilemZILlH1AA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a> * Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a> * Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay.  * Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting. I recommend ordering a slice to go, since you'll likely be to full to enjoy it after eating all this heavy food. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=l12Isv2RMc5q0LRuYmD4wA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/YPav...</a>  I was glad to have found this special soul food restaurant.

My mother called in a to go order because she figured it would be busy. When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said \"OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY\"!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply \"oh well\", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, \"I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request.  As mentioned, my family and I are loyal patrons of the Scottsdale location. It is really sad that the level of service is not the same. But here is a suggestion, maybe if your kitchen staff cannot handle the level of business that you do, HIRE MORE STAFF!!! Or better yet, turn down the music and have the DJ help out! It's a restaurant not a night club. But I am not a Business Major so maybe I don't know from what I speak.",

I got the platter, which included 3 pieces of fried chicken with gravy on the side, corn bread and 2 sides (waffle and collard greens).  I was defeated...   The portions were huge.  It was sooo good though.  It was great having the bottomless jar of drink.  I suggest the kool aid.  Overall it was a great experience.  I met some nice people and had a very satisfying meal.  I also picked up a pretty sick shirt.  The front says \"Eatin' Good-N-Da Hood\"!  I will rep it all the way in Cali!  This is one place I will be sure to come back to my next trip to AZ.",

Most of the choices on the menu are reasonably priced, and the new design of the place is open and bright. I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide.   While the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all. Thankfully, the hot sauce made them taste alright.   Will I come back? Probably, but only after I recover from my heart attack from the last visit.",

It can get very busy and if you go as a party, everyone has to be present to be seated. Which is fair, considering just how full it can get. The chicken was perfectly crispy while staying juicy on the inside. The waffles seemed to have a cinnamon flavor (I don't like cinnamon so it stood out for me), but if that's your thing then they're really good, for me not so much. The ambience is loud, I went around 5:30pm on a Friday, but not obnoxious. The menu has smile worthy titles for their array of dishes. Try it out!",

When your licking your tasty, sticky fingers because you want more and more, and  Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White himself comes over with his chubby belly and jovial laugh and says, \"syrup and butter make everything better,\" all you want to do is add more to shove down your pie hole.

I was then seated in a small room in the back, which has high echoes, alongside two families of 4 and a party of 10, full of children. (Not that I don't like children.. But in a small cramped room..) Needless to say, it was extremely loud and almost uncomfortable.   Our order was taken not long after being seated, but it took almost an HOUR to get my food. We both ordered chicken tenders and waffles with a side of cornbread and a biscuit. For being \"known\" for those dishes, I don't think it warranted such a long preparation time.   I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share of chicken and waffles alongside the coast and the south.. Can't say this one ranks in my top three. Good for Phoenix, sure. But not with that ridiculous wait time.   I also expected it to be burning hot since it was a long wait, but it was warm at best.   On the plus -- the biscuit was excellent and very big. The lemonade/tea was also refreshing. Corn bread was good, but a little dry.   All in all spent 2 hours and a half here and pretty much 2 of those hours were waiting around.   P.S the serving staff was very nice!",

This place is hilarious! The decorations, the shirts the servers wear, the menu, it all made me laugh. Like the sign on the wall that says \"Kool Aid always on tap.\"  We ordered the original, KK's and Shrimp and Grits. Our drinks, fruit punch kool aid and water, came quickly but the food took a good 35 minutes later.   The first piece of chicken, a chicken thigh, was SUPER good. Moist, tender, juicy, everything you would want in a piece of fried chicken. However, the second piece, chicken breast, was rather dry. I guess it makes sense since chicken breast is typically hard to cook juicy. Waffles were good. Didn't really care for the biscuit and plain grits. But the shrimp and grits were really good. Really heavy and packed with flavor.  Pretty good first experience for chicken and waffles. I would definitely recommend the place for their food and experience but the wait for our order was what brought it down to 4 stars.",

Another 15 min or so passed and no drink was brought out, still haven't met our server to take the entree order. Gave them another 5 mins before we got up and left. Sorry, won't be returning to this location.  Time well wasted.",

I called poison control and they told me I had food poisoning. I know it was Lo-Lo's because for breakfast all I had was coffee and it was now lunch when this happened. I spoke with a manager and she said she would get back to me and never called back. When I called them back they never answered! Horrible customer service!

If you want quality service avoid having Steve as your server.  As I sat down this 2nd time around, mind you after I had been seated by the host, my server comes up to me and asked if I sat myself down. I responded kindly and said I'd been seated by the host. Steve's response, \"they sat you out of order.\" Then proceeds to walk away say it's alright. Now, I normally wouldn't care about stuff like this but when your server makes you feel like you made a mistake  it's really sets a negative tone.  Even so I let it go.   He returns, takes my order, delivers my drink and the. I don't see or hear from him for 25 mins or so until he brings my meal. However, he proceeds to tell me to take my plates off his arm, mind you they're very hot, and I don't know which plate to take first because I don't want to cause him to drop anything.  Then he leaves and not once does he check on me or offer a refill.   As I'm getting ready to go, I had to ask another server for a to go container. Steve finally shows up only to had me a $30 bill. I give him a card and for some syrup to go. He brings me back my card and said he'd be back with my syrup and then never returned.  Again, I'm usually very understanding especially when a place is busy but this really left me with a very negative feeling about this place.   I will have to say other servers were more attentive to their customers.",

We came in and were told the wait would be 20 minutes, so that's fine, we stood close to the host stand because there was no seating in the waiting area open. Once people got up from there the manager at the front rudely told us to pretty much move because we were in the way. We ignored the attitude and were seated shortly anyways. Our server took our drink orders and food orders so all good there.. Fast forward an hour and a half later, we still had not received our food. Keep in mind the place was semi full. So we finally said something to a man who appeared to be a manager and he offered to go check on our food. He came back 5 minutes later with our food. Now I've been a server so I could tell this food had been sitting at the window for a good while and I believe the manager said something to the server about it. Unfortunately at this point we had no time to eat the food since 2 friends I was with had to leave for their flight already so we asked for boxes and the check (both were promptly given of course). No one apologized for the wait or offered to at least comp drinks or my friends salad that had cold chicken and the wrong dressing all over it. Pretty disappointed considering I've always had a great experience here.",

I was amazed over their chorizo quality and the way it was cooked; the tortilla was warm and fluffy.

The waffles are amazing, it's fluffy and soft while the chicken is crisp and juicy. I love how they have Kool-Aid too. The other restaurants I've tried in California don't have Kool-Aid!!! And the Kool-Aid at Lo-Lo's is fantastic...it has a perfect balance of flavor and sweetness. It's like they put crack in it or something! My girlfriend had the \"Stupid Fries\" which had cheese, peppers, onions, and chicken smothered all over french fries. It's crazy good too and I definitely recommend to order that as an appetizer to share. Can't wait to return to this place again when I come back to Phoenix :0)",

    "text": "Wow!! Love this place so much!!   Let me start off by saying me and my boyfriend were going to phoenix to visit an old friend. I found this place online and decided to try it. Not ever been to Arizona, i admit the area scared me a little bit haha! we stopped by this shady looking gas station like 2 mins away from it and asked one of the employers where lo lo's was. He said to park in the back so we got in the car and started to search for it. It was about 8 at night. We drove into the back lot and DUDE IT LOOKED SO BAD!!!. Being a wimp i started to not want to persue the place anymore. My bf insisted to park in front and we did. Our friend went came and we went it. It was ... SO NICE INSIDE!! Very clean, well lit, and festive!  I  felt sorry I judged it before i went in. I  ordered the number 9, which was chicken thigh and leg with a waffle. Filled me up just right! the waffles were soooo goood! tasted of cinnamon and the butter was light.   I also ordered the red velvet cake because i love red velvet and i heard it was the best. SADLY I didn't like it. The moistness was really good, but i thought the velvet would be more rich and the frosting was too cheesy for my liking. This cake could be very True to how its originally made so that is probibly why its pretty different from the others I've had.   over all 4/5 stars!!!~ Will be back again!!~",

    "text": "This spot takes me back to my time in The South.  The waffle was good, but not the best (that honor belongs to Matt's Big Breakfast).  The chicken, on the other hand, was fantastic and a pleasure to eat.  Aside from that, I got the Mac n' Cheese and the Collard Greens.  Mac:  some of the best traditional MnC I've ever had.  If you want a fancy one, then try the one at the Yardhouse in Scottsdale, but I digress.  The MnC was as dense as a brick, and it was super, super cheesy.    Greens:  very good, well flavored, but they were served with a bit too much liquid.  I like a little bit drier, but they still had great flavor.  An excellent complement to the chicken, waffle, and MnC.    note:  try mixing the syrup with a little bit of hot sauce.  Do this on the side and dip some of your chicken in it.  Sooooooooooo good!!!",

The staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always. Plus they were playing some jams while we enjoyed our food and they didn't rush us at all even though they were closed by the time we were done. If I am ever back on this side of town, I just may have to stop in and get my fried chicken and waffle fix.",

I had some friends visiting from LA and they wanted to try it since I always brag about how it is waaaay better than the infamous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. lol.   A friend and I shared a soulfood platter. It was 3pcs of smothered chicken w two sides (we had mac n cheese & beans over rice). We had the gravy on the side and added a side of waffles. It also came with a peice of cornbread. I had the sweet tea to drink. The chicken and waffle were still as good as ever. The sides however were not very. Our mac and cheese was really mushy! The flavor was good but the pasta was way overcooked. It almost looked like a bowl of yellow custard. The beans and rice also had great flavor but the rice was a bit undercooked. The cornbread was better than I remembered. I noticed they changed their gravy also. The color is different... more golden than before with little specks of something red. It used to be a light brown gravy with peices of wilted onions. While still good, I liked the old version better. The sweet tea was a little sweeter than normal but I still enjoyed it.  My friends agreed that the sides could've been better but really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. They enjoyed it so much that they wanted to go again before their trip back home. We went the next day to the Scottsdale location and picked up a plate of chicken and waffles from them to bring on the road. lol.",

    "text": "This place is always poppin' but it's worth the wait. On a Friday night, place filled inside and outside, it only took about 5 minutes for my mom and I to get seated. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive from the get-go. I wish I caught her name because I'd give her a shoutout. Anyways, you must must must get the restaurant staple - chicken & waffles. The menu has an array of different combination options (ex. Lolo's: 3 pieces with 1 waffle, etc.) and you are sure to find the one that best fits your craving. I almost ALWAYS go with the Lil C. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken (legs/thighs) and a side of mac & cheese OR beans. The mac & cheese is a MUST HAVE!! And if you are into gravy and don't mind a .50 extra charge, order your chicken \"smothered\" and your chicken will indeed be smothered with their succulent gravy and grilled onions. In my opinion, this definitely hits the spot! However, during my most recent experience here, I decided to order the salmon croquette for a little change. There are several options for salmon croquette (salad, breakfast plate) but my server helped me decide on the salmon croquette platter which comes with TWO sides AND cornbread! I was so excited that I was able to get my favorite mac & cheese and buttered corn for my 2nd side. I'll be honest that the salmon croquette didn't excite me much. It was a tad dry and not as flavorful as I hoped. A 3/5. But my sides were still wonderful. My mom and I saved room for dessert this time and oh my goodness. Their bread pudding is OH SO GOOD! Just the right amount of sweetness and a wonderful bottom crust. It comes with a mixed berry sauce and a little bit of vanilla ice cream. It made my night. Lolos is one of my most favorite local restaurants, hands down.",

I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah!  When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in.   We found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called.  I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick.  I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs.  The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape.  Classy! :)   Overall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check.  The only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a \"last sip\" before he had to hand it over.  It wasn't as though he wasn't going to order a purple drank!",

Sad to say but my chicken breast was really dry (one star lost). I didn't like it at all. Frys food store has more juicy and flavorful fried chicken. I would go back but only to have the waffle and maybe try some other items and hope for better service. I also didn't like how loud the music was. I couldn't hear the people in my party and we were shouting trying to talk to each other (second star lost). It did give me a headache. I also felt the metal chairs were uncomfortable so I stole a regular wood one from the table next over. Lastly, the service wasn't very great. Always trying to find someone to get a refill for us and when they did it would take 10+ minutes (3rd star lost).",

This soul food joint is one of the best in the country - it has a proper back-kitchen, cafeteria feel to it, friendly service and hands down the best waffles and chicken anywhere. There is something uniquely cinnamonny in the syrup that makes the perfect topper to their waffle; the chicken is deep fried, the grits waiting to swim in butter, the lemonade cool and sweet on a hot Phoenix day. Your doctor may not like you going here, but your stomach certainly will.  Find an odd hour to go; Sunday mornings are always particularly packed with the post-church crowd and it's harder than usual to find a seat. Chicken and waffles are good any time of the day.  And a last note - get a t-shirt, wear it around and see just how unusual the idea of chicken and waffles is to the non soul food loving masses.",

After all the carrying on I've heard and read about, I was expecting Narnia on a plate.  It wasn't, but it was pretty tasty fare for the price. I had - in order of supreme goodness - the fried chicken, sweet tea, waffle, and mac & cheese. Fried chicken certainly worth the trip. Sweet tea was amazing;  sweet without being sacchariny and blended so perfectly. Waffle was very nice but I've had better (overseas, to be fair) and the mac & cheese was saucy but unspectacular.

But the reason I'm giving them a 1 star review is because the manager, Mils, (I believe that was his name and as he informed me, he's the ONLY manager they have) is quite possibly the rudest, most condescending person ever. Dude, you're in the industry of CUSTOMER service. Learn how to properly interact with people. I will NEVER go back based on him, solely him. I tell everyone I know not go there because of him. I have never been treated so poorly after making a reservation for 20 3 weeks in advance and being told upon arrival that they had no table ready because no one had made a reservation when their hostess had called literally an hour and a half before to confirm that we were still coming. He was so incredibly rude about it, talked down to me telling me I didn't know what I was talking about, I was wrong and I must have made up the reservation until I played him the message from the hostess at which point, he just walked away. The owner stepped in and asked tables to move so they could get our group in.. We still waited for over 45 minutes. UGH, I work in the restaurant industry, I can NOT imagine treating people this way and expecting them to return. SO BAD. I would highly suggest improving your customer service skills, Mils.

Dirty Red had the biggest meal on the menu and lucky for us, he shared his homestyle potatoes & beans and rice.   the chicken was so moist, while fried to perfection! the waffle was thin with buckwheat (i think) and cinnamon. i'm not usually a waffle fan, but this waffle was amazing. the mac n' cheese was so yummy i literally cleaned my plate (my only complaint was the small serving-but i'm sure they knew it was just the right amount) the homefries were great, fried to a perfect golden brown with perfectly soft potatoes on the inside, they melted in my mouth.   our only  complaint was the bad service (which i really think is only part of the overall dining experience) we were served our drinks at sporadic times, presented with our food and no utensils (i got up to request some, and 5 minutes later Dirty Red had to get up to request some). but ya know what, it wasn't enought to taint my meal...i just picked up my plump chicken breast and went to town, the waffle had to wait.   overall the food is well worth the wait, drive or whatever your obstacle. its the best fried chicken i've had...well..... ever!! go to lolo's you wont regret it!  but first you must find the door, it's off yuma by the misters.

Check  I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.  If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.  Even after I came home from Arizona, I couldn't stop talking about LoLo's for like 2 weeks.  Shoot, two months later and I am still drooling thinking about it...",

The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.  You'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated. You will not find this kind of food elsewhere in Phoenix.",

When I got there, it was pretty obvious that it wasn't the best part of the town but because of the location, it gave more authentic feel to the restaurant with wooden boards and steel bars blocking some of the windows.    When you go in, the lady at the back counter will greet you and unless you know what you want, you have to ask for a menu.  Everyone is friendly and seemed like there were a lot of regulars who even knew the waitress's names.  I tried the LoLo's famous soulfood platter for $13.  I did not read the fine print so I ended up not getting the famous chicken.  When I got my food, I was about to go outside and one of the southern gentleman came from the back just to open the door for me saying \"have a nice day miss.\"  That was nice, I miss being treated as a lady.  The food was less than what I expected.  The fish was dry, waffle was more like a pancake and rice with gravy....I had better.  I even heard some guys complaining the price and quality of food outside when I was walking toward my car.    *Food = ok I guess but I had better...*1 - 2 STARS* if this review was based solely on the food *Service = ok *Ambiance = *+1 STAR* the whole place is filled with the deep south feeling.  I'm definitely happier in the west coast but it is nice to be able to feel like home sometimes. *Location = not the nicest part of the neighborhood but as long as you go during the day, it is very safe.",

    "text": "Lo Lo's is pretty much what you'd expect a place focusing on \"Chicken & Waffles\" to be. Small, lively, full of smiling people all eating, well......chicken and waffles. The line out front attests to its popularity.   After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist.   We had a short wait for our table, but were able to quench our thirst on soft drinks, punch, and sweet tea. The staff was extremely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to love it.   I am a big fan of chicken. I am a big fan of waffles. Yet, I have never had them together. Thus, I decided the only choice for me was their No. 1 Meal, called KK's. Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it.   The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles). In all my life, I have never knowingly eaten this much butter in a single sitting. That being said, it was divine. Everything was delicious and, while I am not a big \"fried chicken\" guy, I must say that all three pieces disappeared quickly. Other members of our group sampled the fried okra and the red beans & rice. I heard nothing but happy sounds as our table of 7 made approximately 15,000 calories disappear. This was followed by groans and calls for afternoon naps as we all piled into our cars to go home.   Lo Lo's is one of those experiences that should not be missed. But, make sure to clear your afternoon and, just to be safe, you may want to consult a health professional.",

Oh and I met Jesse Jackson there lol.   Back to Lo-Lo's- the food was excellent. If you've never tried soul food, you're missing out, and should definitely treat yourself to the early heart attack because it's worth it. Just about nothing beats the juicy fried chicken breast smothered in gravy with a waffle on the side dripping in sweet syrup. Seriously, it's heaven for your mouth.   Highlights:  Sweet tea - Sweet as in it tastes like there's 5,000 packs of sugar in there and will send you into a diabetic coma. Hell yeah!  Greens- I love greens. These greens taste like they're made with bacon. Again, hell yeah!   Potatoes and gravy- The gravy could be a little thicker but I still love it.  The only thing I didn't like too much was the mac and cheese.   The service was fantastic, everyone was kind, prompt, and attentive. You can be waiting quite a while for a table, especially on Sunday mornings when people are coming back from church. Get there right when they open and don't worry about suffering from heat stroke in the summer. Or just wait in your car with the AC blasting until your name gets called.",

Indeed, every time is a good time for chicken n waffles.  However, ONE specific time exceeds all the others.  That is, chicken n waffles as hangover food.  Nothing soaks up those poisons like a Tre Tre's platter with a side of grits and a Dr Pepper/Red Kool Aid.

    "text": "Customer service at Lo-Lo's needs to be improved. I had 3 failed attempts to get as order to go. I called and was placed on hold for 5 minutes. I waited on the phone because I know it is a busy establishment. I hung up and called on my way there. I was told I could not place a order without paying for it  over the phone. Since i was driving and was just 2 minutes away, I said I would wait until I got there to place the order. I had to wait over 30 minutes after my order was taken,  only to be told it would be an additional 10 minutes. I value my time and the whole process at this point was over an hour. I was made to feel that my time held no value what so ever.  People came in the restaurant after me and was served their food  before I was. I have to agree with the other comments that the food is the best of the best, however it takes more than just good food to run a business. Customer service should be the main item on the menu and value customer that appreciate Lo-Lo's  good food. I try to support all black businesses in Phoenix  however poor customer service would make anyone rethink giving support to a busines that does not look out for complete customer satisfaction.",

I didn't have my expectations very high once I walked in, didn't really look like a restaurant but I've heard so many good things from my friends, so had a seat.  Menu is great, there's the usual deep fried culprits and some extras.  Me and my friend went for the 3 piece chicken, I opted for the gravy smothered version.  I was blown away by the taste.  The fried chicken is very crispy, but in the inside its very moist.  Nice blend of spices all around, complements the chicken perfectly.  I'm not a big waffles fan but how could you not love that big dollop of butter siting on top.  The gravy was very delicious, and  the onions were a nice touch.  I washed all this goodness down with their signature sweet tea.  Afterward I went went home and had a nap, let's just say I was very satisfied.",

Yes, I know, a Southern faux pas! Might of been the healthiest thing one could order here.  So after waiting a few long minutes, my main feast arrived.  Where do I start? Ah, good old chicken leg, nice, small and manageable.  Done! Time for my double layer waffles topped with creamy, melty butter.  \"That's money!\" borrowing a gleeful phrase Guy Fieri always says in his Food Network show, D, D, and D. :)  So my two other pieces were the breast and thigh.  I knew what I was getting into so I carefully avoided the glistening, crunchy evil they call: the skin.  But I did have a little and it was packed with all the great tasting herbs and spices that make up this Southern style cuisine.  That is what makes it distinct from your mainstream chains.  Now, the battle between the chicken and waffle, I give the waffle a slight edge.  Its not the thick kind you might expect, but its still pretty good.  Well, all in all, I'm glad somebody in the deep South came up with this comforting duo that even my inner soul can taste.",

We then paid the bill and the cashier charged my card for another tables bill that amounted to $74 (our bill was only $30) and then took another 10 minutes to charge the correct bill. In total, I had about $105 withdrawn from my account that would take a couple of days to refund. Horrible service. I am very dissatisfied and probably won't be back due to the inconvenience.",

When I asked what the potatoes were smothered with I got quite a look from the waiter. (\"What a white girl,\" he probably thought.)  I got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle. Oh yeah, it hit the spot!  My friends all had similar items, but different sides. The collards are True southern greens, the fried okra is perfect and the beans on rice has great flavor. This is the mother of all weekend breakfast/brunch meals. Delight in its glory!",

From the painfully slow speed in which she did everything it was very obvious she wasn't in a hurry to do ANYTHING! We got our drinks then the horribly long wait for our food began. It took 45 minutes from the time we order until we got our food. I have NEVER had to wait that long!! Our drinks were only refilled once they had been completely empty for some time.

We ask for the manager. Carlos comes over and says it would be 15 minutes for greens and there won't be a problem.  Carlos then comes right back and says it will be an hour for greens. No apology no type of compensation for the huge issue. So we suggest a complimentary margarita in the meantime and Carlos looks at us crazy and says \"on the house\" like it was an unimaginable request.  After he dismisses the suggestion he  tries to sweet talk us into string beans. We agree. 25 minutes later we notice two tables seated AFTER us and one has greens. We then call Carlos over and tell him what we have recognized and he argues with us saying we haven't been there an hour because the waitress put the order in 25 minutes ago and it was placed after the two tables that arrived after us. Needless to say they lost two customers today.",

    "text": "My first time going there(September 2018) My date ate the majority of his food before I got mine bc they said \"yours will be out shortly\" I told him to go ahead and eat because I didn't want his food getting cold expecting mine to come out soon. 15 minutes must have passed and a server told me she told them to make them again. I'm just trying to figure out why it takes so long to make pancakes. She did Offer me some collard greens while I waited.... but that's not what I ordered so it kind of ruined my appetite. (The collards were good though) and my was service ok. She at least kept my drinks full. However it did take my pancakes over 25 minutes I honestly want to say 40 minutes to come out. By then I was full off the collards. And they didn't even take them off my check. I didn't say anything because my date didn't complain about paying the bill and I understand things happen because I do you work in a restaurant.   Came here with my aunt yesterday afternoon around 3 bc we were on that side of town. My first experience wasn't the best but I wasn't going to let that leave a bad taste in my mouth. I understand a busy server & I understand a busy kitchen but that doesn't mean this server shouldn't be attentive. Our server walked by our table at least three times before greeting us more about 10 minutes after we sat down. We saw a table get up and leave because he wasn't greeted in a timely fashion. I don't blame him but I have a little more patience. There were even Tables that sat down after us were greeted before we were. Even though they had a different server. You can tell there's no such thing as teamwork there. Like I said I work in a restaurant and if I see my neighbor is busy I would at least speak to the guests and let them know that their server will be with them shortly or at least acknowledge their existence. Even get a drink started for them just so they're not waiting there with nothing.  I noticed it was busy when we got there so I expected the food to take some time but to disregard your guest who supposed to be helping pay your bills is beyond me. OK so then my food comes out 7-10 minutes before my aunts does. I gave her my side of collard greens so that I am not eating alone in front of her because that's rude. If there is a table of two and one person's food is ready you shouldn't bring out just one person's food. If it's a dish that takes longer to cook you cook that first. It's common sense. Would you cook your eggs before your bacon? Anyways I could see if it was a group of people and one dish was trailing But what is the point of going out to eat with someone when you're going to be eating alone. Also my food came out lukewarm. We all know what fresh fried chicken feels like. Why bring it out ahead of time if he's not going to be hot. And if my food takes a long time I expect it to be hot. I didn't want to say anything because I was annoyed and didn't want any discounts. But I had to send it back by then my aunt's food has still yet to arrive. This shouldn't have happened at all. My aunt paid the bill and was reluctant to even tip her a dime.  I talked her into leaving something. I know there's a stereotype that \"black people don't tip\" but some of y'all give them a reason not to. To disregard of my presence is blatantly disrespectful. When my food came back out the second time it was hot so that's the only reason why am giving y'all two stars. Definitely not coming back here though. And I'm not going to say this servers name because they know who they are. Hopefully this teaches you a lesson and you never treat any of your guest like this again smh.",

We went on a Sunday and there wasn't much of a long wait since you can check in online, if you go there, I don't think the wait is long either. The service was really good, our waitress was attentive and knew her stuff.  I would highly recommend getting the fried cat fish. It's so damn good, best I've ever had. Also go the famous chicken and waffles, definitely more than enough for one, and it was delicious also. We also had mac cheese side and collard greens, those were ok for me. The food here is pretty solid tho. Definitely would come back if we're in the area again.",

What I didn't know is that they have around 5 restaurants throughout the Phoenix Metro area to include Scottsdale. I could have saved myself a few minutes of driving had I known that. None the less I made it here and the menu was so extensive! No matter what they put on there the only thing I knew I wanted was some chicken and some waffles! Some shrimp and grits caught my eye so I end up ordering those as well.  The waffles were Bar None the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! They had a hint of brown sugar in the batter and they were melt-in-your-mouth magnificent! The chicken however was pretty good it wasn't the best I've ever had but it compliment in the waffle superbly!  The shrimp and grits were a masterpiece to the naked eye. I would say the highlight of the shrimp and grits were the shrimp, they were battered and seasoned to perfection as well as plump and juicy! The Grits however, left me wanting more. I grew up eating grits so I know what grits taste like. The bacon bits kind of help save the grits overall it was still a tasty dish!  grades: waffles- 9.5 chicken-8.25 shrimp- 9.0 grits- 7.5",

Our waitress quickly greeted us and got our drink orders which we all went with water with lemon.  The drinks came out quickly in these huge mason jars.  We all ended up with some version of the chicken and waffle combination. We also order side of Mac n cheese and sauteed spinach. Everything came out about the same time but took a while but we know that good food is worth waiting for.  While we all enjoyed our meals it did remind us of our favorite place in SoCal. While this place satisfies our craving, it would not be replacing them.  My mini me and I really liked the chicken (I got the two wings and she got the drumstick and thigh).   The seasoning and crunch was on hit!  However we all thought the waffle was ok because it was a little soggy.  We usually like it a little crispy but we still enjoyed our food regardless.  I definitely will come back and try some of the other great food they have to offer.",

    "text": "In a recent review for Roscoe's in Long Beach (CA), I noted that the chicken and waffles combination of grease and carbs, accompanied by sweet tea, was, for years, my late-night, too-drunk-to-care breakfast of choice.   Now that I'm sober and all grown up, my standards have risen and my expectations have changed: the food had better be good, and the venue's owners should care at least as much as I do about the quality of the service I'm afforded when I spend $10 to $20 on a $5 plate of food that I can cook at home.  Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles in Phoenix gets me, and gets that meal just right.  Their chicken is juicy and tender inside, and, importantly, crispy crunchy outside, coated with a deliciously complex and savory seasoning ostensibly passed down through several generations. The waffle, often an afterthought on menus offering C&W, is a fluffy delight that holds its own against the bird; think pancakes, with character.  Service at Lo-Lo's is provided by a team of young people who earnestly hope for their customers' comfort and well-being. The servers' efforts seem neither rote nor insincere.  These positive things being said - and I'm emphatically positive about Lo-Lo's - it must also be noted that the design and content of Lo-Lo's advertising and marketing materials is an odd combination of racist and \"ratchet\" imagery and language - unsettling and confusing to those not in on the joke, and no less bothersome to those unsure whether they should laugh, when they do get it.   I won't give examples, but if you're curious, imagine Jews doing \"we're sneaky and cheap\" schtick, or Jeff Foxworthy commenting on his branchless family tree. If your imagination's piqued, visit Lo-Lo's online.  Notwithstanding the awkwardness, I'll dine at Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles again. I can ignore what I don't enjoy about the business, understanding that it's not for me, or about me.   And the food really is quite good.  ****************************** Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/roscoes-house-of-chicken-and-waffles-long-beach?hrid=k_5LMCW9t9yUSDPguG-Pxg\">yelp.com/biz/roscoes-hou...</a>  Lo-Lo's online: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Floloschickenandwaffles.com%2Flocation%2Fphoenix%2F&s=8ac2492c7cd4f2d94fafff7b2656b9347fa68708980ade1936e4b52f79217d6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">loloschickenandwaffles.c...</a>",

The fried green tomatoes were fresh, hot, crunchy, and tangy, just like I like them! Fried green tomatoes are a southern dish and I live in Atlanta, so I know green tomatoes! The green tomatoes at Lo-Lo's can certainly hold there own up against the ones I've had back home!  The fried chicken was hot and delicious as well, not the best but tasty. And the waffles were just OK, reminiscent of the waffles at waffle house. Also the service was great, whenever I'm back on this side, i'll be sure to visit Lo-Lo's again.",

She was working the tables on either side of us but not acknowledging us sitting there.(the other were wrapping up their meals). So no biggy she apologizes and thanks us for waiting. She gets our drinks ordered quickly and brought back just as quick. Our appetizer took no time at all to come out. FRIED GREEN TOMATOES in January! They were fantabulous! I also ordered a Melon Mojito from the bar and that came out super fast as well. The bar tender even came to the table to see how I liked my drink, which I loved.  Fast forward to food, all of our food came out shortly after we finished our appetizer. I everything I had was great. The chicken and waffles were just great together. I had a wing, thigh, and a breast. All were crunchy and moist on the inside. My kids who are hard to please ate every bite of their chicken strips and waffles.  My husband got the platter with fish and chicken. His catfish was super juicy and flaky. Though the crust was very crunchy. On point!  My only complaint is how loud the music was. It was like being in a club. But none the less. Great food!",

The food is amazing.  Fried chicken perfectly seasoned, juicy and crispy! Mac & chee, waffles, green beans all cooked to southern perfection!   A giant mason jar of blue kool-aid is the ultimate accompaniment  in my opinion, but they now have a wide range of alcoholic bevvies to wet your whistle if you prefer.  Chef Nicky stopped by our table twice to personally ask us about how we enjoyed our food - nice touch!  (And this is just one example of the spectacular service that we experienced the entire time we were at LoLo's!)  This place is rockin! I can't wait to show it off to out of town guests and local friends alike!",

Unfortunately, with limited food to choose from and slow service (despite the feeling we got that everyone working was just trying to go home and not be bothered) - tonight was the exception.   We had butts in the booth at 9:59 tonight, and as the waitress handed us menus we were told they only serve chicken and waffles after 10 pm. NO sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles. Couldn't even get a salad. Fine, except that the table immediately ahead of us was able to order whatever they wanted, and we were the only other table waiting to order. Seriously, guys? The cut-off is THAT strict? We could HEAR that family order. That's BS. Not to mention, since all we had to choose from was chicken and waffles, why waste our time by giving us menus? Y'all. Get it together.   Then, 20 minutes AFTER we put our order in (which was at 10:05 btw), a server delivers mac-n-cheese to a different table. Tell me again why you can't send a side over to our table at the same time? Smh.   Somewhere between being charged for a lemonade we didn't order and it taking forever for the waitress to come back for our checks, I lost a little faith in Lolo's. I usually eat a lot earlier and now that I know about it, the limited menu after 10 won't be an issue for me. I just won't come then.   The service tonight WAS an issue, along with the fact that their \"after 10\" policy seemed inconsistently enforced. Before tonight, I never hesitated to recommend Lolo's. Now, I have to add my own \"after 10\" disclaimer to match how awful theirs is.",

I had heard so much about this Southern food style restaurant from friends that I was so excited to finally check it out!   The Phoenix location is very nice with great ambiance on a weird lifeless street.  The restaurant offers valet parking (at both locations) which I was surprised since its not in an upscale neighborhood The Scottsdale location is next to a hotel).  There's a separate attached space for happy hour and special occasions.  The restaurant clientele was a sprinkle of every race your could imagine.  They play the latest R&B and hip hop (kind of loud at the Scottsdale location) for your listening pleasure. I was so excited to get inside and sit that I ordered a little of everything; chicken, buttered corn, potato salad, collard greens, cat fish and stupid fries (yes, that's the name - smothered yummy!).  We also tried to sweet Tea (not the Kool-Aid) served in a mason jars.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  Customer service was top notch and did I mention the Chicken....Finger lickin' good!!",

I anticipated a wait to be seated when it's a Sunday morning.  I did not expect to wait for almost an hour to get our food.  We waited for another 20 to 25 min after asking for the check.  In total once we had been seated we probably stayed there for 2 and half hours (mostly just waiting). I am not going to lie, our appetizer came out pretty quick, but I can only assume that after that we were completely forgotten about. Our food was cold once we finally got our main course and we may have mentioned something to the waitress if we ever saw her again. The lady disappeared so we had zero refills and just sat there thirsty.  No manager apologized for the wait or anything. Finally she came back we asked for our check and it was wrong.  She \"fixed\" it and it was still wrong.  After we left we couldn't help but laugh about how bad the experience was. Maybe try the Gilbert location if your hungry.",

That's what happened to me recently when I arrived to Phoenix. My colleague promptly drove us to Lo-Lo's after leaving the airport and dammmnnnn!  Let me preface this by saying that I don't usually eat anything fried, but at Lo-Lo's you have to eat something fried if you want to truly immerse yourself in this eating experience. We had appetizers of fried green tomatoes that were deep fried to golden brown while the tomatoes remained juicy and succulent. Then we ventured into the \"Eats\" as they refer to this part of the menu here. I had the redfish with a side of mashed potatoes and greens. GEEZ!  If I'm going to eat this this stuff, then I'm going to EAT THIS STUFF!  But for real-the cornbread. This cornbread here-this cornbread here?! I'm still dreaming about that damn cornbread days later. Carb dreams about that cornbread...  Put it like this, I will not ever come back to Phoenix and not eat at least one meal at this place while there.  Live a little people!!!",

They brought out our drinks in the traditional mason jar-looking glasses.  And when our food came, I instantly smelled the intoxicating combination of fried goodness and sweet waffles.  The chicken was moist and crispy.  Not too salty.  The waffle had a great chewiness to it.  The buttered corn was, well, buttery and cooked well - soft with just enough bite.  I do have to say that I was disappointed in the Sockittome cake.  It was moist but wasn't very flavorful.  The place is super small so it wouldn't be a great idea to go with a large group.  Other than that...the food was pretty good.  Not THE best fried chicken I've ever had, but still very tasty.",

The chicken was crispy, but needed salt and the breeding was a little bland. And no flavor to the waffle either. So, fun place, VERY friendly staff and everyone seems to love it. I'm glad I came, just sorry I wasn't overwhelmed. Actually, I might be tempted to come back and taste other things on the menu. Lots looked tempting, but I was on a mission this time.",

She offered us biscuits that she would not charge us for. We also ordered omelets. That took another 20 minutes and only 1 order out of 2 came out. It took another 10 minutes for the other order.  The omelets were great but the rest of experience was horrible. Probably won't go back!",

    "text": "I discovered Lo-Lo's while on a business trip to Phoenix, and boy and I glad I did! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly and sat promptly. The menu was filled with many delicious options, but ultimately I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken, mac & cheese, and collard greens. Normally, I am one who immediately reaches for salt or pepper no matter the restaurant, except here. What's more, is that I didn't even realize that fact until I was nearly halfway done with my food.   The flavor profile of the dish was intense, I could tell I was dining on a old family recipe that had been passed down and updated over the years. The Kool-Aid was indeed large -- maybe even too large -- but very tasty. For dessert, I had the Red Velvet Cake, and that too was very scrumptious. The sponge was moist, and the frosting wasn't overbearing, but just the perfect punctuation to a well-crafted sentence.  Now, I must be honest and say that the reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is because I came back for Brunch the next day -- a Sunday. I was very excited to return, mainly to have the Biscuits and Gravy, and sadly, I was underwhelmed. Not only did it take an exorbitantly long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it appeared as if it had been sitting under heating lamps for quite some time. Not to mention, the flavor profile was not nearly as intense as my previous meal there. Might I suggest to this establishment to start taking reservations. Not just for your patrons, but also for your kitchen, so that the line can be equipped, staffed and prepared for the monstrous crowds that flock to this otherwise great restaurant.",

I absolutely loved the waffle as it was hot, fresh, and delicious! I tried it without syrup, just to see how it tasted before the condiments and it was still awesome... a hint of cinnamon is in the batter. I was thoroughly impressed especially since I'm not a waffle person. The chicken initially was flavorful, but clearly had been underneath a warmer to stay hot. Since I'm a stickler for fresh, I sent it back and asked for fresh chicken. The waiter exchanged it with no issue. The lemonade was fresh-squeezed and so good. Aside from the small hiccup on the chicken, my first experience was excellent. Oh and the music was awesome! I will definitely return.",

We also like that the drinks are served in big mason jars. Some of the best iced tea we've ever had. Great decor, cool atmosphere. Jazz playing  through the speakers. Very comfortable and welcoming vibe. Lots of smiles from hostesses and servers. Good family restaurant, but also a cute date place!

The first time i went, our portions were huge - good enough for two leftover meals. I learned on my second visit to not over do myself.  The chicken is well cooked - the meat is still juicy and moist on the inside, while the outside batter is fried to crispy perfection.  The side of mac and cheese was the best I've had in a while - it seemed to have sauteed onions with multiple types of cheese as the base.  The waffles were slightly disappointing and soggy on both of my visits - perhaps this is a personal preference though,",

We were told that the person that answered the phone NEVER relayed the message to the person who actually keeps the list & gets the guests seated. Needless to say we waited about 45 mins & watched as several other groups of people who also called ahead were forced to wait among those walking up. Although we didn't mind the waiting; it was a lil discomforting to have that happen. Once we did get inside service was prompt & our order taken immediately. One of our guests did have issues with his order. Apparently he always orders an omelettes & we were told that the person who usually does omelettes was not there so he could not get it. He ordered something else & again it was a no-go. That sucked quite a bit but all in all the experience was fun & I definitely wouldn't mind going again.",

    "text": "I've worked downtown for years now and have always heard about this place. We went during lunch time and there was only valet parking, no regular parking which I thought was odd. You can park on the side street which we did but only after we waited on the single valet to park 2 cars that were blocking us. He was working hard but he was just the only valet there. Free but of course you gotta tip the guy. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit or just wasn't made corrently. The homemade hot sauce is amazing. Like most down home fried chicken places they're a little expensive. We put in a order for the three of us to go and is was almost $50. Just standard 3 pc meals, not their most expensive plate options. This place is always packed and people rave about it so I don't want to say never go there but my individual visit wasn't what I hoped for. I may give it another shot because I love good home style friend chicken and hot sauce. Waffles were excellent though!",

In any case:  - service was great (we got there when the place opened, there weren't that many people in there...yet) - the chicken was very good.  - the waffle was 'meh'. - the cheesy grits were good.  all-in-all i'd go back and recommend it to friends.",

As other reviewers have mentioned, the parking is tight and the area of town is iffy.  But it's totally worth it.  I mean, do you know anyplace else that has Kool Aid on the menu?  Their menu looks amazing -- I haven't seen chicken gizzards on a menu since I left home, and though I haven't tried them yet, they're on my list for the next visit!  And their fried chicken is AMAZING!  It may even be better than my mom's (and I can say that honestly because she's not on Yelp yet).  It seems like fried chicken and mac n cheese would be easy to do well, but as anyone who's been to KFC can tell you, that's not the case.  LoLo's has great food and the staff was super attentive, even though they were busy.  We'll definitely be back!",

Our food came out fast, but my plate got cold waiting for a side that I wanted to go w/my meal. Only was checked on one time as well. NOT a happy customer. As a server, I always give other servers breaks, but the over all service, was shit. I left a $4.76 tip on a $29.24 check because I understand shit happens, I just would not recommend going to that location.

Not only was the food delicious but also the service was pretty great. The only thing is that since we went on a pretty busy night specially since a lot of prom groups seemed to be there the service wasn't very quick to get to us.  Our server had a lot of parties going in and out and it seemed he forgot about is for a minute but he apologized profusely and was very nice and courteous throughout the night.  I only got a small serving since I'd had a pretty late lunch but it left me wanting more at the end of the night. The waffles were my favorite but that's probably because I prefer sweets rather than savory foods. The serving sizes are great and the drinks were right to my liking. I had a monitor which was divine next time I'm definitely getting a larger size.",

I recently had the fried catfish, with collard greens and candied sweets.  Being from the Texas, those collards were a welcome little bit of \"south in my mouth.\"  The catfish was cooked to perfection and the wait was reasonable.  The wait staff is friendly and welcoming.  New location, new, more positive experience.  Update:  This new location rocks!  We tried the take away this time, and it was the same great food, and it came to us hot, fresh and ready to enjoy.  The counter staff were quick, attentive and got our order ahead of schedule.",

I'd bet that they are using high fructose corn syrup vs. sugar in their waffle mix! Last two times we ate here, all of us had sugar crashes and stomach aches. I'm so bummed!!",

    "text": "TOO MUCH HYPE!  I came here for my supervisors going away party and wasn't satisfied. I guess we should've made reservations because this place was packed. We had about a group of 12 and the wait time was around 15 minutes. Not too bad, it gave everyone time to look through the menu.   Lolos appeared to have a decent variety of foods, including desserts. The prices range from $7 and up.  I ordered the Lolos which came with 2 waffles and 3 pieces of southern style chicken. The waffles were surprisingly thin about an inch and the chicken,  surprisingly large. I was told the chicken was really small, but you can share the portions for the most part. The chicken wasn't flavorful,  in my opinion it lacked salt just a tad would've helped. The chicken tasted pretty low quality. The waffles were very flavorful though,  I could clearly taste the cinnamon they'd used. The thing about the waffles I didn't like was the soggy texture. The texture could be due to the thiness of the waffle. I didn't try any of their famous Kool Aid so...but they get a star for their service...everyone seemed alright and helpful.   Overall,  I think I'd expected something grander than overpriced bland chicken, and limp waffles. I'd rather get my chicken and waffles from IHOP...blasphemy,  I know, but it actually taste better to me.",

Next time I will try it mixed with Koolade. Wait was ok for lunch time. One of 3 plates came & we were told tables were put in wrong order so other 2 plates would take a few min. Chicken wasn't too flavorful but was perfectly cooked & juicy! Tasted great with the ranch. Waffle was tasty & crispy but soft inside! Food was hot. Plate was more than enough. Atmosphere was well spaced & not too busy on walls which I like. Will return! If not for mix up of tables & awkward wait area would've gotten 4 stars.",

    "text": "Recently ate at this establishment while in Arizona visiting family. This restaurant was suggested to us and we were so excited about getting some good ol Southern Food. I truly would have given 5 stars if I was basing this review on food alone. However; this review is based off our entire experience.  First let's starts with the   Pros: the front door staff/ hostess where extremely friendly and were able to seat our party of five in a decent amount of time. The food absolutely hands down delicious. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried to perfection. My collard greens had the right amount of flavor and heat to taste. Don't get me started on the waffles omg AMAZING. I truly enjoyed my food so to the cooks GREAT JOB.  Now on to the   Cons: our waitress Edith although friendly was not that attentive. I ordered the catfish appetizer and specifically requested it come out prior to our meal.. well that never happened because our food came out before the appetizer. I had to let her know that I no longer wanted it because it was late coming to the table. Also she rarely returned to our table after our orders came out and seemed like other waitstaff was picking up her slack. She forgot or it just took several minutes for her to bring things that our party requested back to the table. For example I order sweet tea which I didn't get until I wad half way through with my meal. Once finished we requested some Togo boxes and a bag which the boxes came out but no bag then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the bag and check.   After paying for our meal and getting back home I noticed I was still charged for the catfish appetizer. I called the restaurant and was told to hold while they get Edith on the phone. Once she got on the phone and I explained my calling she said to please hold while she gets the manager to adjust the charges to only be hung up on. I called back and then was reconnected to Edith and was told to hold again while charges are reversed. I waited on hold for about 10 to 15 minutes when finally was told charges had been adjusted. I am just hoping in the few business days it takes to show the reversal on my card that it actually does.   All and all I loved the restaurant, food, and friendly atmosphere. But didn't care so much for the service received.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat and enjoy the soulful cooking.  Just note that some staff training maybe needed.",

    "text": "4.5 stars!   To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.    Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink.   The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.  The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.  The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.    Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.  To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No True Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.  My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.",

I would be shocked if this was not the case because it was one of the driest fried chickens I have ever had.  I got a breast, thigh, and leg.  The waffle was solid but not enough to make up for the dried out chicken.  I was not a fan of our waitress who made it a bit too obvious that she was trying to upsell us items.  I was not asked about getting a refill on drinks for the entire hour I was there.",

My mother in law was in town and she wanted to try something out of the ordinary.  So I remembered this place.  She's a big fan of Mexican food and when she's in town we always eat that.  Well since she was feeling adventurous we decided to go here.  Well let me tell you.  Everyone is right about this place.  Food it's awesome!! We all went with the two piece chicken and one waffle and my daughter got a side of mac and cheese.  We finished every single bite of the chicken, waffles and mac and cheese.   Food was so good we regret not getting the Lolo's plate which comes with three pieces of chicken and two waffles.  Lemonade and blue berry Kool-aid were delicious as well.   Waiting was about 20 minutes to get a table and about 10 minutes for a waiter to noticed we were there and get our drink and food order.  But oh my!! Wait was definitely worth it!!!",

The waiter was not very good he didn't check in much and after he brought our dessert and we finished it and brought us boxes he never brought our check and we waited almost 20 minutes for it. You would think that asking for a to go box would be the queue to bring the check but not for that guy. I love the dark meat chicken it was DELICIOUS but the white meat was so dry I chocked on it. Next time all dark meat. The Mac and cheese needed a little more salt. Banana Puddin' was good Peach cobbler needed something Chicken fried chicken was fantastic Sweet Kool-Aid No grape though...:(  ALL IN ALL IT WAS GREAT FOOD BUT THE 3 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE AND THE NO RESERVATION AND THE LONG WAIT AND HOW LOUD IT WAS.",

First and foremost the parking here is crazy and it takes some patience walking into this place. On the weekends they have free valet but if come during the week its a fight for a spot kinda deal. They now opened up the lot next door that is gated in  front of some shop, along with the side street parking.  Walking inside the wait can be a little frustrating and can turn a lot of people away that I've noticed. The seating area is small so you will have to stand and endure the life lesson of patience. On the weekends they do have a DJ between the bathrooms, so that's something to look forward, is the great jams!  Once seated the food comes out fairly quick and it is always hot off the stove! I always order Lo Lo chicken breast and drumstick with one waffle, side order of the mac and cheese with a grape kool aid!    Let me tell you my yelpers it is worth the time, the patience and the angry moments now called \"Hangry\"",

The pros: Several of us ordered the tenders and waffles basket and everyone was pleased. Chicken was expertly cooked, breading was crispy, seasoning was excellent, and meat was moist and juicy. The waffle was hands down one of the best I've eaten, spiced with cinnamon I'm guessing, it was fluffy and sweet and perfect. Paired together with syrup, I could eat it all day everyday. Lastly, they have Kool-Aid (which, you should order just on the basis of when can you order Kool-Aid at a restaurant) and it was the best I've ever tasted. The iced tea was also good.   The cons: the service was a bit slow and our waiter a bit short but nothing that would stop me from coming back. The ranch dressing was also average.",

I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random.   We get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing.   We got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful.   Then dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol. The prices are on point. The serving sizes are HUGE...so in reality you get more than what you're paying for.  We will be back again....and again.....and again...and again! Besides, I still gotta try the mason jar kook-aid!!!!",

A couple minutes later, she beckoned us from inside the front door to \"Come on in\"  - as if this were a special clubhouse or night spot.    Inside, our waitress was friendly and knowledgable and a tag team staff is always breezing by, anticipating needs: refills, napkins, defibrillators.  A couple tables over, they fussed over an elderly patron like bees on a honeycomb.     There's a pleasant and thoroughly Black self confidence about Lo-Lo's that's, I dont know...affirming.  They're good at what they do, and treat everybody the same- which is quite well - even if you're a patronizing N. Phx yuppie on your annual sociological trek down to the hood.  We were the only Anglos in our area, and felt welcome and thoroughly taken care of.   Righteous chicken, laughably huge waffles. Lunch here and you may not eat again til breakfast.

The building is a converted home into a restaurant thats been around for years.  Inside the setting is funky and cool.  Theres usually a wait and on a hot summer day that can be pretty hard to do outside in the heat with only a small canopy of shade and a rotating fan with a mister.  However, the wait will pay off when your food arrives.  I recommend going when its cooler outside so its not so miserable.",

    "text": "I had a fever and the the only thing to cure it was... more LoLo's chicken and waffles! I was actually there with Dave R. because we had a hankering for fried chicken. We both ordered #3's along with the red Kool-Aid. I opted for beans over rice and Dave had the fried okra.  The chicken came out nice and hot with just the right amount of crispyness that's not from too much batter or coating, but from the right amount of frying. The waffles were the perfect compliment. The right amount of sweetness along with the heaping spoonfull of butter on top. The rice and beans were knid of put off to the side because of the \"main event\" but were tasty none the less. My only concern was the sweetness of the Kool-Aid. I couldn't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid, but I never remembering it being this sugary. Maybe my mom had the right idea and only put 1 cup of sugar in to mix. What, the recipe only calls for one cup? This was my 4th visit to LoLo's since moving out here last year. I was a regular at Roscoe's in Long Beach, CA and the only difference is in the waffle. Roscoe's puts cinamon in their waffle batter that gives it a unique taste.  Also, unless you have been fasting for a week, the #1 is a lot of food! I finally learned my lesson and went for the #3 and I still couldn't finish my waffles.",

The food was excellent, prices were reasonable, and the service is outstanding.  I got the number 10, which had two chicken legs and one waffle, plus I added a side of mac and cheese.  The chicken was awesome.  Not too much breading.  The waffle was light but crispy.  Put those two together and it was perfection.  The mac and cheese was overcooked, but it still had good flavor.  I will probably try another side next time.  Overall, it was a great and everyone in my group walked away with a great experience. We went for lunch and we are considering going back for dinner!",

    "text": "The novelty of the place does impact it but it shouldn't be discounted. Phoenix doesn't have a lot of unique mom and pop restaurants so when you find one like Lo-Lo's that offers soul food in the valley, you should definitely check it out.   The food itself was excellent. I've been to Gus' fried chicken in Memphis and the chicken here is just as good. The side dishes is what prevented this place from hitting 5 stars. While they were good, they were nothing special. I will come back here again.  One more thing, this place is safe. We went here on a Saturday night assuming the place would be full of questionable characters because the restaurant's location isn't in the best part of the city (Buckeye and Central) and at night on a Saturday, we were a little worried about safety. However, everything was fine. The diners were all classy with a great mixed crowd of African Americans and Whites and even the staff is mixed. It was rather \"preppy\" believe it or not. We will definitely come back.",

I figured that since it looked and smelled so good I would bite my lip and eat what I had in front of me. The waitress walked by and noticed. She insisted that they make me the plate that I ordered and the one that I had been eating was on the house. At first I said no...but she wouldn't hear of it. The rest of the menu was sitting in front of me in five minutes. Now...I am a good sized guy with a ravenous appetite, but that was ridiculous. I will say that everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything. The highlight of the meal was the MACARONI AND CHEESE. BEFORE YOU DIE (caution: it might be the CAUSE of your death) you must eat their mac and cheese.

The waffles are ok, they're good, but a little soggy. The chicken was burnt... I am used to the golden, crisp, \"light and fluffy\", chicken, but this chicken was thick, a lot of fat, and was very greasy. I understand how fried chicken is made, but this chicken was heavy and very very greasy. Ordered banana pudding, I was looking forward to it, but it wasn't that great.   The location was very busy, I am to assume that was a factor with the food results and how poorly it was made. The staff was somewhat helpful, our waitress was called into work to cover a no-show. It was obvious she wasn't pleased about it. That too may have played a part in our food, however, I have been there again and same results.   The food is decent, may visit again, but depends on whether I am near central and buckeye, which is rare that I am in that area.",

Short version: everything was wayyyy better than we could have hoped for!  Possibly the best friend chicken I've ever had - golden brown and moist & juicy with excellent batter.  The straight-up fried chicken is superb, but I ordered mine \"smothered\" with chicken-onion gravy and it was soooo good.  The waffles are also great - light and flavorful batter with a hint of cinnamon.  And yes, Lo-Lo's proves that chicken & waffles belong together!  Honorable mention: the sides.  We tried collard greens, fried okra, creamy grits and candied yams (some of the best I've ever had).  Not a single wrong order out of a table of 5 on our first visit - doesn't that tell you something?",

I ordered a arnold palmer with sweet tea and my friends got grape and red koolaid. All the drinks were great and served in some pretty large mason jars. The Arnold palmer with it's mix of sweet flavors and bitter bite of lemon was a great way to wake up and get some fluids of the non-alcoholic kind.  For food I got the Baby Ray's which is chicken covered in gravy and onions and some waffles. It was great the chicken was super moist inside and the flavors of the chicken, gravy and waffles make a savory bite that was as pleasing to the stomach as it was the tongue.  The gravy was just enough to cover the chicken but not so much it was too much. The waffles have a spice in them that i think is nutmeg but makes very flavorful on it's own without syrup.   The meal was exactly what i needed to get me up and back to normal...sadly it was so good I ate so much I needed a glorious food coma to recover. I can't wait till I can come back and try the other goodies like Mac and Cheese or cornbread. Even the fried fish sounds good.",

The grits were ok, as best as I could tell, given it was my first time eating grits. The ambiance wasn't great, but about what I expected, given the location. The location was scary. The service was functional. The best part of the meal was the SWEET tea served in a mason jar...and I do mean SWEET!  I can't say I'd want to go back, but might if others wanted to.  I would offer some other restaurant choices, if asked.",

Convinced our party to give it a try and we were glad we did.   We were seated promptly and our \"drank\" orders were taken very promptly. Of course I got the number 9 and mac and cheese because its not optional. Crispy crunchy chicken and waffles and warm syrup is all I could have imagined and more. Probably the best waffles I have ever had in my life. It would be worth going just for the waffles. The chicken however didn't have much spice or flavor in the breading which was sad since it was cooked beautifully.",

Having lived in Phoenix for quite some time now, I find it very sad that I've just discovered the awesomeness that is Lo-Lo's, but now that I have I am happy to say I can go back whenever I want.   I found the service to be very prompt and friendly. You could tell the people liked working here, and who wouldn't with access to some of the best waffles and chicken I've ever tasted. Now, I've been to Rosco's Chicken and Waffles in LA and I've got to confess, the chicken tastes similar at both. It is fried to perfection with just the right amount of seasonings. Where the two places differ, in my humble opinion, is the waffles. Lo-Lo's wins hands down in my opinion. The waffles are to DIE for! I don't know what it was, maybe the butteriness, maybe the syrup, or just the waffle batter, but man oh man was it good! We took home a piece for the red velvet cake and didn't get to it until 3 days later and it was pretty good... it probably would have been WAY better fresh that day, but we were TOO full to partake.   Anyways, I can't wait to go back, but I've just got to lose the LBS I gained from the first meal- then I can return!",

    "text": "Wow what a great lunch! I have never had chicken & waffles before and always wanted to try them since it made no sense to me. We went to the location on Buckeye and I was surprised to see how nice the restaurant was. Very clean, modern, well done. Service was great, felt at home right away. The current menu is a bit confusing with many different options but since I knew I wanted to try the chicken & waffles I ordered the Double D. The waiter suggested fried green tomatoes to start, since I have never had those I said yes! They were good too. Then the chicken and waffles came. Soo good! The batter on the chicken is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing! The crunch and spices are great. The flavor of the waffles were perfect and the syrup was not your standard store bought syrup, it added so much. Loved it. My 3 yr old daughter ordered chicken strips and a waffle, she devoured it. Since then she walks around the house saying \"Lo-Lo's!\" and \"I like Lo-Lo's!\". She want's chicken & waffles everyday now and I agree ! To finish our server suggested banana pudding, I expected some yellow jello-o like pudding, but got a gourmet banana dessert again with great flavor, full banana slices and some sort of crust in there that was awesome. It's obvious the chef's taste their food here, I really can't say enough about how well all the pieces tasted together. I will go back for sure, after I ride my bike, jog, or go swimming :) so many more new things to try, collard greens, shrimp & grits, red velvet cake...",

I hadn't been to a chicken and waffles joint since I lived in LA years ago so I knew the kids would be all for BREAKFAST FOR DINNER (aka waffles and chicken). The place is bright and hella noisy music wise but service was friendly and attentive. The fried chicken was absolutely top notch and I love, love, love, rooster hot sauce. The waffles weren't as great as the chicken but my kids still devoured them. The collards were surprisingly bland but fries were good and again the chicken is fabulous!",

They even have valet parking now! But it's still as packed as ever and the food is as awesome as ever.  I met up with some friends on Sunday morning. We had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine.  After we were seated the first thing we ordered was Kool-Aid. Red. This is the sweetest Kool-Aid I've ever had. They must use twice the sugar. But it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles. I always get the Tre Tre's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle. They really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken, it's just the best thing ever.  My friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing. For $4 it was pretty small, and they only got one. It was not really worth it. Go for the mac and cheese instead!  For a good soul food breakfast, nothing in town beats this place.",

The server dropped off the plates for both people in my party and walked away without saying anything. So then I had to wait a few minutes for my food to come. Overall, the food was pretty good and had large portions, but the service was not the best. The server wasn't even around most of the time and when we did need something, she dragged around slowly to get it for us. What really irritated me is that she offered us refills for our kool aid, but never mentioned that it was gonna be an extra $3.50 for a refill per person. Honestly don't think I'll be back to this place unless I just get a to go order.",

Paid extra to have a breast to take home the next day - it was even better the next day! And the bottle of beer served in a brown paper bag was a nice touch.  The place is BUSY so plan for that. We were a large group and service was still very attentive and made sure we were pleased with everything. If you have to wait for a table, do it, it will be worth it.

Fresh clean new much more spacious....So you ask why did I take away a star? The place is trying too hard. They intentionally spell stuff wrong on the menu in fake slang to give it a hood feeling. Its more expensive than it used be. They've added new combinations of chicken just to make the menu longer. The waffles now are more doughy no flavor. I got the smothered chicken with a gravy that was neither southern tasty or appealing to the eye. The bill for two people with one alcholic drink one appetizer and two dishes was ~50. I'd rather drive further to the closest popeyes and be under 10 bucks a person. Or even Church's and get an amazing apple pie for a buck.",

While some may say the location isn't the best [okay, it can seem pretty sketchy after dusk], the food is amazing!  I usually get the Betty's Boob[a waffle and a breast] and some mac & cheese if I'm feeling extra hungry.  The waffle is always crisp and delicious and the fried chicken is delicious.  Gotta love that savory-sweet combo of a syrup-y bite of waffle with a juicy bite of chicken.  *shivers*  The service is always friendly and this place is usually packed. Lo-Lo's definitely lives up to all their hype [don't go to the Scottsdale location though.  Totes not the same.]~!",

    "text": "First time for me having chicken and waffles as we don't have them in the UK!  Okay so I want to start saying that the food is great, it really is but that's where it stops.  The wait you're almost guaranteed to face is atrocious and the servers don't give you accurate times. The first time I visited I told them I had a flight in two hours and they assured me it was fine. That time we spent 1 and and half hours waiting before we had to leave without eating.  We gave LoLo's a second chance whilst passing through Phoenix and once again the same inaccurate waiting times were being told to everyone. When we were seated and ordered the first waitress we dealt with was lovely, a bit smile and very helpful, however another waitress who did stop by ant one point was so rude and uncaring it put me off coming here again. No greetings, no smile, she looked like she HATED her job and we could feel it. The food was great though, lightly season chicken that was tender and juicy without any grease. A simple light waffle to accompany it with a nice little pot of syrup. I order over-medium eggs on the side that came out undercooked and when I returned them they came back completed solid and overcooked which was a shame. The meals didn't leave us full at all. I had 2 eggs, 1 waffle and 3 chicken pieces and my partner had 2 wings and a waffle. We both wanted to eat more but considering our bill was already at $25 with no drinks we decided against it. Unfortunately the food is overpriced in my opinion and the portion sizes are now massive and just aren't filling. I wouldn't come here again, the wait times, hit and miss service and expensive food (2.50 for a single piece of chicken) make it not worth it for us.  LoLo's is one of those restaurants that knows it has guaranteed business so it doesn't try as hard as it should.",

I was here with friends visiting on Thursday evening 03-02-2017.....For starters the Service was so unprofessional and the hostess rude just as if she did not want to be at work. It took all of 40 minutes to be seated and there were tables just not cleaned off. Our waitress was nice but, when the food finally came out, the Chicken was burnt and cold. Ordered New chicken sad to say it came out even worse the 2nd time; the red beans and rice horrible,  white rice and chilli beans I know this is Phoenix but, No soul at all. The young staff was so unprofessional and management could not keep up. If I could I would give this Resturant a negative 1 star. We left all the food  on the table paid or bill $$$ the tip for this business. Upgrade your service and definitely the food.....",

Thank you for blessing me with the delicious fatty goodness of deep fried Chicken thighs.  My recommendation would be to get the #9 Lil' Amadi.  In my case I just told the waiter I wanted a Drumstick, a Thigh and some Mac n Cheese.  He knew the exact correlating menu # and name.  My favorite uncle got the #2 Baby Ray with a side of Grits and a giant jar of Red Kool-Aid.    The Chicken was so juicy and tender.  Fall off the bone with succulent delight wonderful.  The waffle, for how thin they are was perfect.  You'll think Belgian waffles are for wimps after having one of these.   There was a slight hint of cinnamon to them.    The Mac n Cheese was addictive.  There was something to it?  Something I couldn't put my finger on as to why it was so good.  My son, who is also learning to eat big people food really enjoyed it.  My uncle said the he was about to go into a diabetic coma after eating his meal.  His name it Bruce A.  Read his review too.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tap water tasted like it was dipped from the canal.  And they were out of Red Velvet Cake.  I know, what's this world coming to?!  They did have Sock It To Me cake.  I got it to go and had it for breakfast the next day.  It was perfect for breakfast.  It was light and kind of cinnamony as well.  As we were leaving I told the waiter that I live near Oakland and that Lo Lo's beats Home of Chicken & Waffles hands down.  The food, the service, everything about it.  If I could eat here every day of my vacation I would.",

I took my team out to lunch and we had to wait almost one hour to get seats, but it turned out that poor communication on the waitstaff end worked against us and we ended up spread across three tables - WHY???   No sooner did we get seated that we were told they were busy (I could tell) and we should either hurry up and get our order in, or wait for the next waitperson, since our waitress was leaving for the day (in the middle of lunch rush hours). Someone came by and wiped our table clean, because it was still filthy from the last customers. We got drinks - cool Ball 1 liter glass jars - loved it, but the \"Cool-Aid\" didn't taste like Cool-Aid. Grew up on the stuff so I ought to know.   The food came to the table cold, and I did have to ask to have the fried chicken (usually served warm) re-heated. That took another 15 minutes - wonder where it went for that time frame, by which time my waffle was cold and greasy - what happened to the waffle, FFS?  I had to eat in a hurry, since we did only get two hours for the break and it was taken up with waiting. There is no food worth waiting two hours on - seriously, there's no place where you have to wait for two hours to eat. I'm not going back there unless they can prove they are able to take care of paying customers, and even then I will put it on camera, so I have proof.",

I was there when the doors opened and was immediately seated. My server was quick to take my order and even made suggestions that I don't usually have. The grits. OMG they were so creamy and smooth. Not one mouth full had any lumps in it. The sign of some good grits. The chicken and waffles again were delicious. I love the original downtown location as it has a total different feel than the others.  Yes this is a repeater for me.",

First of all the wait was over 45 minutes and there is limited seating for people waiting. I had the chicken and waffles, chicken was the highlight for me, but the waffle was very underwhelming. The peach cobbler was also a miss for me, I had the Lolo's punch, which was pretty strong but not worth the price. I will say our waitress was great and very friendly, but this is one place I will scratch off my list as go to spots in Arizona.",

The food is absolutely wonderful and if chicken and waffles aren't your thing (you should try it) there are plenty of other options available. And note this...they have kool-aid. What restaurant do you know that serves kool-aid? So much to love about LoLo's! Go and find out for yourself!",

    "text": "Food is usually good, but quality (especially of any meat) is inconsistent. Service NEEDS IMPROVEMENT, and that applies to ALL locations.   I started going here when this location was literally a hole in the wall. It was cramped, the line was long, and the food was AMAZING!   Now they've expanded to at least 4 locations (Central Phx, PHX airport, Scottsdale, Gilbert) and the QUALITY of food, service and experience is so disappointing that we rarely visit.  We happened to be in Central Phx last night, and we decided to stop for dinner with our 3yo and 10mo so I could get my chicken & waffles fix.   We ordered drinks, which were correct, then ordered food, and everything seemed fine and good. My meal (the Lolo's) was brought out correct and timely. And then it just snowballed.   My husband ordered the Hood burger, and was given a chicken sandwich by a server who was not assigned to our table. Another server, also not assigned to our table, brought a plain cheeseburger to our table, taking the chicken sandwich away. STILL the wrong burger. Our assigned server FINALLY came over, and she took the burger back to the kitchen, they plopped what we're assuming were the other ingredients onto it, and gave it back to him. It's a $14 burger, and to say it was disappointing is an understatement. Also, he asked our server for extra mayo, and every time she returned she forgot it. (She never wrote anything down either, and her memory was evidently more sieve than steel-trap ). We asked SEVERAL times for our sons mac n cheese before we finally received it. Our server acted exasperated when she said 'they didn't bring you anything, did they?' As though it was someone else's responsibility to do her job.   We asked for boxes to go after just a few bites of food, which our server did manage to get for us. She placed our bill on the table, never asking if we wanted anything else. I asked about the banana pudding I had ordered to-go when I had ordered my meal. She acted like she was about to get it and walked to the kitchen, but then casually walked by moments later to take our bill off our table only to return with the corrected one (including the banana pudding). I had noticed she hadn't written it on our original order  so I suppose no surprise she had forgotten it.   She got a 10% tip. My husband wasn't pleased with his meal. I was moderately satisfied with mine. But the meal was over $50, and as they had messed up his sandwich, he shouldn't have even been charged for it.   We made several bathroom runs with the baby and toddler. The bathroom stalls were low on toilet paper and the bathroom smelled like sewage. It was evident no one thought it was their job to keep the bathroom tidy or stocked. While I was in the women's washroom, a lady actually had to open her stall door while sitting on the toilet to ask me to get her toilet paper! Poor lady! Glad I could help her, but that's just how low stocked the bathroom was.   Overall, disappointing and I no longer can recommend this place in good conscience. I've been here in the morning, early afternoon and now in the evening... and the only thing that is consistent is the inconsistency they maintain with the food, service and experience. I have loved this place for a long time, but I doubt I'll be visiting any longer  and I certainly won't be advising any out of town friends to try it anymore.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times and it's good but not up to the hype everyone says it to be. I was never a fan of the basic thin style waffle they provide especially for the price since it is a must in this place, personally just wish they have a thick option later in the future(Hint hint). While the chicken is great, my main squeeze will always be the catfish beignets which are deliciously fresh, hot and fried. My only gripe is for some reason, they always charge me for asking for the sauce that is supposed to come with it. The special I had one day, fried mac n' cheese is nothing more than what it is... fried mac n' cheese with bits of bacon inside. While in whole it sounds good, just hype at the end.  The phat azz samich was pretty good as well as most of the sides they provide. Never was a fan of greens until I tried them here, fries are good, rice and beans actually went well together with the BBQ sauce, green beans and taters were my favorite as well as the whipped potatoes. While it is a good place to eat, I think it is a lot more word of mouth that makes this place what it is, but it definitely does not take away from it being a unique soul food restaurant that has some great dishes. Be sure to call ahead as usually there is a standard 20-30 minute wait for tables on weekends when it is extremely busy.",

I placed a to go order and waited about 30 minutes because they were extremely busy, no big deal.   When I got home with my order it was completely wrong.  I paid extra to have all white meat and only had 2 chicken wings and the rest was all dark meat.  I ordered dessert and that didn't make it in the order at all.   I promptly called and was passed around to 3 different people before being transferred to the Manager.  He took my name and number and advised he was going to pull my ticket (I paid with my debit card) and get back to me..... i called back 3 hours later and spoke to the same manager who rudely told me they were extremely busy and that he would still look into my order and call me back before they closed.   It is 2 days later and I have yet to receive a call back.   I paid well over $30 for 2 -3 piece meals that were totally botched.   I have always recommended LoLo's to friends and family when they visit.  Needless to say this poor handling of my complaint has lost them a patron and all my referral business as well.   Extremely disappointed!!!",

I had no idea they had moved from the tiny house that Lo-Lo's started in to the huge modern new location (still on Central and Yuma) just South of downtown Phoenix. Very impressive building that can accommodate many many more people than before. It's still packed like it always was but you can check in online using Yelp!  It will tell you your time window and when to arrive at the restaurant. Very cool!  Food is sooooo good. I had a three piece chicken platter and got mac n cheese and collard greens as my two sides. The hardest decision is what sides to pick. They have many and they all sound really good! It also came with corn bread. Best corn bread I have ever had. The platter is so huge, I only ate one piece of chicken and took the rest home.   They do have alcohol now, but I ordered sweet iced tea (best in town).   I was way too stuffed to order dessert, but they looked really good. Perhaps I will order dessert first next time!   If you are in the mood for some soul food, be sure to go to Lo-Lo's!  Don't forget to check in online through Yelp.   Enjoy!",

Modern style establishment with an old school vibe with many of the greats pictured on their walls such as Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles and Muhammad Ali. The employees were friendly, helpful and welcoming from the moment we entered. Fun menu with enticing names for their the dishes such as, \"Phat Azz Samich, Yo Mamma's Biscuits & Gravy and A Jar Of Drank\"   Ordered the Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits, Three Piece Chicken Smothered in Gravy & Onions along with a waffle, Collard greens and Mac & Cheese for our sides...Everything tasted of fresh and quality ingredients. Crispy, tender, juicy golden brown chicken paired with the Soft, aromatic and flavorful waffles covered with syrup is just one reason I will be back! Fresh shrimp cooked with sauteed mushrooms, Scallions and bacon over a bed of grits was a great combination of greatness! I could talk all day about the food, but I believe it's best for people to try Lo-Lo's themselves!  Thank you Allison for the great recommendations and amazing service!",

I have worked in restaurants back in the day in the south and have won a few contests for recipes so i feel relatively qualified to give a review about this.  Here's what was good:  the service was good and wait staff friendly.  Portions were large.  Here's what was wrong:  1.  Chicken breast was over cooked (dry) and way under-seasoned. This being their main product, it should have been really good.  Big disappointment.  2.  Waffle was not at all crispy nor very warm (chicken was plenty hot though).  3.  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe (pink).  You do not make fried green tomatoes with semi-ripe tomatoes.  They taste different and the texture of the tomato comes out mushy if not green.    4.  Tea is a Southern soul food staple, however Phoenix water is crappy and the water there is not filtered.  You can definitely tell this in the tea.   5.  Sort of expensive considering.  We also had cornbread and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  What i am saying here is this is an approximation of Southern soul food but it ain't the real deal.  It came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients.    Jennifer B.",

Most of the time, I can't bring myself to support such a rip on an original restaurant idea that's been made to seem like it's the only one of its kind, but in my four years in Arizona, I have to admit I've gobbled up many calories here.   Don't let the neighborhood or the space keep you away. It's a little on the dingy side, but the people are the nicest around and they're super helpful. Obviously, you'll want to get chicken and waffles. The chicken is crispy and flavorful, but it differs from Roscoe's because it is sometimes dry-- I go for the white meat, which usually stays a little juicier. The waffles are good, but they're not the best. They get the job done, but lack the cinnamon-y flavors of Roscoe's. I usually get a side of home-fries, which are sometimes amazing, sometimes just average, and a big jug of red cool aid.   I'm usually pretty stuffed by the time dessert rolls by, but word on the street is, they've got a decent red velvet cake. Park on the street, but make sure to read the signs/ lock your doors. Just a short drive to South Mountain if you want to work that meal off up the Kiwanis Trail!",

Wife and I go after work around 4-430 when feasible, before the rush, and we are able to get in, seated, and out.  The chicken is superb, the waffles are golden brown, the catfish is stuperbly bursting with flavors, if you never thought of chicken and waffles, try LoLo's they will change your mind.",

I believe that Lo-Lo's not only has the best fried chicken in Phoenix, but the best waffles as well.  If you enjoy either, you must come here.  You can also buy a mason jar of red drank.  This is available nowhere else in the valley.  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good, but not my favorite style.  The real show stopper besides the chicken and waffles is the Red Velvet Cake.  Indulge.  Seriously.  But make sure you share.  Also, this is a bad place for first dates because it takes a really really remarkable person to tear your attention away from the food.",

Got there before the lunch crowd and found seating easily. Started with the sweet tea (Dayum it is good!). Was in Jacksonville not too long ago at a BBQ place and I thought their sweet tea was good, no way - LoLo's has it dialed in!   Had the LoLo's plate - A (2) waffle, 3 piece of chicken, then I added a side of Grits. Grits came with a square of butter melting on top. I thought it made it sweeter. I thought the grits were a little overcooked, but the butter made them really good! Was able to sample the cornbread... WOW!  The Chicken. Probably the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life! The Waffles - a light sweetness in the batter with a toasty taste. Did I die? Needless to say, I finished half the waffles, 2 pieces of chicken and the grits and I am good for 24 hours! Satisfaction has been reached! I gotta try the koolaid and the mac and cheese next time. I will be back.",

    "text": "The good:  New location is gorgeous. Terrific decor and atmosphere.  Food is great. Waffles are light and fluffy. Chicken is a little salty but very tasty.   The bad:  I called in my take out order from home, and got to the restaurant about 15 mins later. I still waited abut 15+ mins for my food.  While waiting aman who was obviously a vagrant came in and asked for a glass of water. The hostesses ( there was two) got the manager, he said ok and ask the guy to have a seat. The gentleman literally sat leg to leg with me, held out his fist  for a fist bump with me and leaned in for a whisper. Well after I fist bumped him, he whispered in my ear how he's out on his luck and needs $50 for some oxy..... After I said I didn't have any cash, he said no prob, and kept rambling on to me about how much pain he's in. Yeah it took the manager at least 4+ mins to get this guy a cup if water. While both hostess tried to look busy and not look at me and my new BFF.  After the guy left they continued to ignore me, didn't say why my food technically took 30 mins. Or apologize for sitting a drug addict next to me and hit me up for a 50 spot.   Price. I ordered a total of 3 waffles and 2 chicken wings. The price came out to $16.52. Market average for Premium Jumbo Chicken wings is 1.99(<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fconsumermeats.com%2Fdetails.php%3Fid%3D2220%26c%3D45%26s%3D%26pqn%3D%26name%3DFresh-premium-jumbo-chicken-wings-40lbs-case&s=df6a74c65a8905fca858e649f2f60d5ae3bd6fb5c6fb27007b437040108b5e82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumermeats.com/detail...</a>.) that's .67 cents each. If you add .25 per waffle ( on the high side) that's $2.08 plate cost.  Yeah 800% markup on a 13% food cost. Ridiculous price markup for a 2 diamond fine dining restaurant let alone a chicken and waffle joint.   Staff: I was there on a sunday morning about 9am. The place was about a 1/4 full.  I thought I noticed a lot of staff floating around, so i decided to count.  There was : 1 Front of the house manager 2-3 Hostesses 5-6 wait staff 1-2 bust boys  And a whole kitchen full of other people I count count.  Front of the house alone there was 1 staff for every 2 customers.  Ridiculous.   Overall thoughts : Good food, great new location. Slow, egregiously mis managed, grossly expensive, poor customer service. Will return in 2013 and see if any things been fixed.",

For a matter of $5 that they refused to refund and dismissed the issues with our order, they have lost at least 10 customers from our place of work as I will order from another place instead.

Last night i dropped by and was going to get some Cake for the house and now I guess that they do not do orders to go, just 1 slice of cake really, they are to busy to box up 1 slice of cake.

    "text": "Boo on the Food! This place is way over hyped. They tried to charge $7 for a little waffle and 2 cold, greasy chicken thighs. Not impressed at all. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool.   First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \"Oh it is the best soul food\", \"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \"cool\" or trendy.   Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh.   Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.",

Everyone agreed the food was excellent, but the service was abominable.  The server never came over to ask if everything was OK.  It took three tries before they got my bill right.  Two other things we didn't like.  The original restaurant on this site was cozy with a couple of small rooms.  They have enlarged it, so the original ambiance is gone.  Also they had a DJ playing so loud that conversation was impossible.  Not likely I will return, even though the food is excellent.",

We had the waffle and chicken, service was fast as was the delivery of the food. We were pleasantly surprised at how good  the chicken is They have no parking lot or waiting room, you wait outside for a place to sit. For us it was just a few minutes. We enjoyed the experience, for us this it is what  casual dining was like before the arrival of the Chains. Good experience",

The food is indescribably delicious and well executed and the staff could NOT be more pleasant and attentive, but one of the most important reasons to high tail it over to Lo-Lo's is because this place is a rapidly vanishing breed and a foodie experience you won't ever forget.  Abandon your diet, forget counting your cholesterol and treat yourself to a meal that will make you weep with pleasure.  Life is too short for Subway sandwiches when a temple of deliciousness like Lo-Lo's graces this weary world.  And this I vow: I will never visit the city of Phoenix again without stopping to eat at Lo-Lo's.  And I can't wait to experience Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe!",

    "text": "Apparently, someone was fired from Roscoes Chicken N Waffles in LA, moved to Phoenix, opened their own restaurant, changed the name and a few recipes (not the waffles) and BOOM! Lo Los Chicken N Waffles. Here's my review.  Location: SUCKS. I thought my GPS was malfunctioning when it told me I had arrived at my destination. Hole in the wall shack on the corner of a busy street across from a fenced up empty lot. There goes the ambiance.    Actual Restaurant: Too small and cramped. Very mediocre looking. Lots of signage written in Ebonics, menu items had ghetto names, Kool Aid flavors (Who puts Kool Aid on a menu and charges $2 for some colored sugar water?!) were Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, and Red....WTF is RED?!    Employees: Cordial. Wouldn't say friendly. One copped an attitude when I told her this place was just like Roscoes.  The Food: I had the Sheedahs Special (1 breast 1 wing 1 waffle) and a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was very salty. Salt does not equal flavor. The waffle was DELICIOUS. Just like Roscoes. The macaroni and cheese I was appalled by. How dare someone use cream of mushroom soup to make Mac and cheese with! That's a cheap way to make it creamy. I was sickened. 2 bites and I was done.  Maybe I'm just spoiled by Sistahs Soul Food in Long Beach or the REAL chicken and waffles joint who've I've named several times already but I couldn't see what all the hype was about. Lo Los is for people who have Lo Lo standards for soul food apparently. Don't think I'll make the visit again",

You can share these ooooooorrrrr eat them as a meal if you don't feel like waffles.  Fries, peppers, chicken, cheese, and gravy.  There may be more things included, but it really doesn't matter because they were bomb and that's all you need to know. Mac and Cheese = BOMB Chicken and Waffles.... Really?  You need me to review this?  Amazing!! If you've never had chicken and waffles before, you have no idea what you're missing.  It's like heaven on my tongue.

They are very good, and so is the chicken, but I have recently discovered Stacy's superior version. The sweet tea is hella sweet to the point of total saturation, and everything is swimming in butter (Matt Poole must have taken this idea from here). The quality of the egg cookery varies quite a bit, and so does the red velvet cake (the last time I had it, it was burned).   Will any of the inconsistencies keep us from returning? Hell no.

Now, this place is located opposite someplace with barbed wire on the fence and adjacent to some pretty decrepit looking buildings.  The waitress told us to sit anywhere and we located a mini-room with an open table.  I ordered the BABY RAY (3 pcs of chicken (I chose leg, thigh, and wing) smothered in gravy and onions).  First off, the pieces were just massive.  I mean large, but incredibly juicy and tasty.  The gravy was good, as were the waffles.  I also shared the CHICKEN GIZZARDS & RICE served smothered in onions and gravy.  I didn't care for this too much as both deep frying this thing and smothering it in gravy were just a bit on the much side.  The CANDY SWEETS (yams) were just okay as well.  I washed it all down with some fine 1/2 sweet tea and 1/2 lemonade.  Overall, I like the fried chicken and gravy in my neighborhood better (see Moe's Chicken & Waffles in Fontana, CA), but I don't think you'll be disappointed by Lo-Lo's.  As far as a need to eat in this area, I think FEZ wins this bout.",

I put some hot sauce and pepper on top and that made it very good.    My fiance got the Soulfood Platter and ordered cheese grits on the side.

From the moment my wife and I walked in, we were immersed in the soul food vibe. From the kind hostess, to the music playing softly enough to hear, but still enjoy a conversation, to the walls covered in murals of family portraits, all the way to the food... Oh my, the food. Southern fried chicken and waffles, grits, collard greens, and sweet tea in a mason jar. As I ate, all I could think was, \"Thank you, Jesus.\" The ONLY thing that was a little disappointing was the catfish, a little too thin and a little too dry. But the rest of the experience made it a single drop of rain on a sunny day. If you're ever in Phoenix and you love soul food, do not wait as long as I did to experience Lolo's.",

Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work....   Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!",

    "text": "I don't yelp I've never felt the need to but something this amazing I want to share. Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish. So sadly my first yelp review ever is a terrible one.",

I called one day and they advised me that there were no to go orders, I asked to speak to the manager because I had limited lunch and previously when there's been no to go orders someone at the restaurant allowed me to do one or he'd have me come in and be seated and I'd have my food boxed so I would be in and out with time remaining to get back to work on time. Maurice wouldn't let me speak and kept yelling at me that there is no to go orders and I said I understand I just wanted to ask if you could...and he wouldn't let me say anything. Then I said what kind of customer service are you providing? You're not letting me speak an she told me that he did not care and he was not wanting to listen to me and hung up the phone in my face. He is super rude and not fit to deal with people. I would not have asked if people in the restaurant had not worked with me in the past, I used to go at least 1-2 times a week which is why they worked with me. I had never not shown up to pick up an order or anything. Other than this issue I loved the place and the service with others who work there.",

The lack of acknowledging the customer and making them feel welcomed.  They take a long time to get your order, once you have your food not once do they stop by to ask if you need anything else, they were sure quick to bring the bill.  They don't smile and act as the customer is a burden.  NEVER again will  I go there,  to be treated like that when I spend my hard earned money NOPE, Not again.

Their chicken tenders had an almost indescribably good seasoning & were fried to golden, crunchy yet-moist perfection. The waffle was suitably crisp on the outside, tender & flaky on the inside. The cheese grits were so good & buttery that I want some now! The mixed-grape kool-aid was a great thirst-quencher, sweetened just right.

The waffles were fluffy and chicken was tender and crispy. The banana bread pudding was also amazing. We weren't gonna get it because we were too full but Wes, the manager, brought it out for us anyway and it tasted heavenly.  Wish we had a cool chicken and waffles joint like this in Philly!",

Gave me catfish instead of salmon croquettes the waiter was rude kept bringing us the wrong things and had a attitude the whole time like he didn't feel like taking our order, he got the order wrong anyway and it took him a long time to even come back to the table, I told them I was done can I speak to the manager about what's happening,the guy came back said the manager \"said\" and I was like so he isn't going to come out and correct their mistakes he was like oh he can take it off the bill for you! I was like , that's not the point I came here for good food and you guys messed up! Keep in mind I still haven't got my salmon croquettes! And it been 50 mins past, not even the manager could correct the issue or atleast being polite to come out and talk to us but no! This place is going into the ground! Never going back yuck! Horrible customer service, not real soul anymore in this place! Never again!",

Service - ok.... not bad not good. she was nice but not like a friendly nice. nice enough to earn some tip. the other guy who constantly swings by the check on us (not our server) was nicer.   everyone managed to finish the fried chicken but kinda left the waffle along",

    "text": "Starting with a five star review, there were a few things that were five star quality. We were a group of six adults, with a toddler and an infant.   The catfish was some of the best that I have had in a while. Good size portion, cornmeal coated, crispy outside, moist inside. I wish I could cook mine about like that! The flavor of the potatoes that came with the biscuits and gravy were really good as were the biscuits and gravy.   There were a few four star things. Our server was kind and attentive and was really trying to do a good job, maybe over trying? Mistakes were made in our order, not sure if those were the server's or the kitchen's errors, but those mistakes were corrected. They even left the incorrect appetizer on the table and brought the one we had ordered, and as should have been, no additional charge. A biscuit was ordered with the catfish, however, corn bread was brought out. Not a big deal, I was back and forth between the two anyway.   Now for the three stars things. For a place with \"Chicken and Waffles\" in it's name, the four people that ordered Chicken and Waffles felt that the chicken was just kinda Meh. Some of it was dry. It just didn't stand out as special. The beans and rice had crispy bits in it. I am guessing it was dried rice? Really distracted from the meal as a whole. The biscuits and gravy were more on the warm side than hot.   I probably could have done a 3 or 4 star rating even with \"Meh\" or \"nothing special\" of the food overall, however, after sitting my 6 mth old baby in a high chair for a bit, I pulled her out to comfort her, and then realized how grossly dirty the high chair was! Stuck and dried food were everywhere. I took a wet wipe and wiped it down, the wipe was mostly black when I was done. The restrooms were also not so clean. It wasn't busy, we went before the rush. There were probably as many employees walking around as there were customers at the time. This lack of attention to detail has made it so that this will not likely be a place of choice for our family. And as my baby girl's health and well being are top on my list, the dirty high chair alone would make it so I would not ever bring her again.   Overall, this would have been a one star review if it weren't for the catfish.",

Let's start with the food we ordered a smorgasbord of things I myself went with their namesake the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great but the chicken was awesome a nice crispy skin with juicy tender meat underneath. The mix of the sweet syrup and some Lo-Lo's hot sauce made a perfect sweet heat balance on that crispy chicken.   The drinks in Lo-Lo's were also quite good the waitress could see we were men on an alcohol Mission so was very generous with our beverages.   That gets me to the service we were waiting for some friends who had a later flight than us so We pretty much had breakfast and lunch at Lo-Lo's all with the same waitress Brittany. Who was outstanding. She was on the ball the entire time we were there. She also helped us out with some places to see while we were there and things to do since we didn't know the area. Brittany would be a reason I'd go back to Lo-Lo's.",

I loved it while I was a visitor and still love it as a new resident. My in laws are in town so we took them and they loved it. They had the traditional chicken and waffles while I had the catfish and fries. They're always consistent.  Don't listen to negative reviews, try them for yourself. You're going to love   So we went again yesterday because we have friends from home moving here. I got the catfish and fries again (my favorite) but I also tried the greens. Yummy!

Oh and also peach cobbler which I did have ,a little more about that later.  The ambience of this place is nice the music is urban I should say, it's a highly decorated restaurant, the lights are a great level.  It's important to add that this was a take-out order and prepared as a takeout. Unfortunately, the food which is why I am doing the review, it's just not enough for me to give a four or five stars to this restaurant.   The food here is just too inconsistent and it's absolutely no \"SOUL\" to anything that I ordered. I ordered the typical chicken and waffles expecting a great meal unfortunately all I got was flavorless poorly crusted chicken and a a flavorless soft waffle with no personality. The most disappointing factor as when I ordered the peach cobbler. Again no soul. The cobbler came in a container that consisted of a cut that didn't offer me a full serving of peach cobbler. Meaning I received a cut of cobbler that had more bread then peaches and technically wasn't able to taste the entire cobbler serving but what I did have I was not impressed sadly.   As for the customer service that I received (because I did order inside the restaurant) the cashier was very insightful on the menu and answered questions that I had. The to go order came with everything that it should have and packaging  as well as the bag were very sturdy.  I honestly wouldn't recommend this place but I would choose this place with friends because of the menu choices and the ambience that could provide great laughs. I don't see the hype!",

We ordered two drumsticks and waffle for the kids to share, smothered chicken and waffles, and shrimp and grits!  All delicious!  Shrimp and grits were bursting with flavor, chicken fried perfectly and the gravy sauce just added to the flavor.  My little boy loved his chicken so much he ate it to the bone and I really think he licked it clean!  Hospitality here is excellent....you can tell all the wait staff here are attentive and everyone works super hard to please their customers.  Our waiter, Matthew gave us biscuits on the house because our meal was a bit later than expected!  Thanks a bunch.....those biscuits were fabulous!",

    "text": "Some places need no introduction. Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is one of them.  Most people I know are familiar with this valley original. Just in case you know the name, but have yet to sample the southern/soul-food offerings, try this simple test. Drive to the nearest Lo-Lo's and stand in the parking lot. It's gotta be the most intoxicating aroma around any restaurant! I had no idea how good sweet maple and savory fried chicken smelled together until my first visit to the original Lo-Lo's on Central.  I'm lucky that my lunch time co-horts have an adventurous attitude toward eating. Either that or we're all closet foodies. Regardless, we ended up just south of downtown today and I was in the mood for breakfast. I've tried the chicken and waffles on previous visits. Today was an opportunity to enjoy the biscuits and gravy.  We arrived before noon because this place can fill up fast. We were seated right away and our server Alexis was awesome. The food arrived quickly and everything was piping hot. The fried potatoes were obviously cooked to order and the biscuits were fluffy and covered with a delicious sausage gravy. Probably the best version of this dish I've ever enjoyed. And my co-workers each enjoyed the Betty Boob (chicken breast and a waffle).  Good food, great service, friendly staff, nice decor... What more could you possibly want?",

Then we waited for drink refills which was another 20 mins. Then we made the mistake of asking for a side of ranch, you guessed it 15 mins and we asked 3 different people!!

Second, the service at this (and maybe only) visit of ours, was atrocious - no good ole fashioned Southern Hospitality here... 'get you in, eat it up and go about your way' service technique!  No hellos, how are yas' or thank yous.  Third, the 'Southern-Style' Chicken with eggs, home fries and toast and their Betty Boob Chicken and Waffles along with the corn fritters were anything but 'Southern'!  From someone who knows and who's fave food is just that, it is not.  From our time in line waiting to be seated, through seating and departure the customer service (or lack thereof) was none existent, abhorrent, lackluster and downright appalling.  We were uncomfortable throughout what should have been at worst a reasonably enjoyable experience.  But overall our experience is bewildering and are stunned by it's popularity!  Unfortunately, Lo-Lo is a No-No for us.",

Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.   The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.  The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on. The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.   Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars. My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left. There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.   If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.  Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated. When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).    Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.   The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.  Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans. The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through. For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.   The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it. The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy  It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!  Definitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!",

The additional star is that I found the fried  chicken this time to be less salty and quite good.  I had the coleslaw as a side and found it rather nice, creamy and with a subtle back taste that was refreshing.  The big plus of a visit to Lolo's is the capable and friendly staff, not too much in your face and not too absent.  A nice mix.    I will be back soon for breakfast.",

Wasn't sure how it would all go, but the sales rep, Toyesha, helped me as I narrowed down my menu selections, and also advised that two of their staff members would be onsite to set up, make the waffles for the guests (so they were fresh, and not rubbery and cold), and help with service.  It was AMAZING, the staff were on time, friendly and helpful, the food was delicious, and we all had a great time.  Especially me, because I didn't have to cook or do dishes!  Bravo to LoLo's!!!",

Things can get mixed up, understandable, but when I ask the hostess why? She gives me the explanation \"their name was on the list first.\" Lies. How does an iPad mess up the order of names?

    "text": "First attempt to eat at LoLo's (on a Sat afternoon) was a fail.  Groups of peops were waiting outside, and because I don't like standing around looking hopeful we left and made another date -  - this time during the week.  There was no line, but the place was still full!  We asked for a booth and within 5-7 mins one was cleaned off then we were seated.  I immediately liked the high ceiling and covered patio with some cushioned seating.  They really want you to settle in while enjoying your meal.  I also noticed there were many employees.  At one time we counted six on the floor.  I don't know how many more were in the kitchen. They all seemed quite friendly and I didn't see any bad attitudes in the young staff (a sign of good training and employee ethics).    The food was not incredible.  I might have a different review if I liked chicken and waffles, but I don't so I opted for the salmon croquette.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being fabulous, I'll give the salmon croquette a 3.  Sorry, but all I tasted was egg.  There was hardly any salmon and I won't be ordering that again.  Ever.    For veggies, the greens were delicious.  We ordered seconds.  They were not overcooked and had no meat flavoring. A+ The sweet potatoes were wonderful too.  I wasn't a fan of the cornbread muffin, it was too much flour and not enough corn.  For some folks though, that's how they like their cornbread.  If you're watching your cholesterol, though, better tell them to hold the butter or else you'll end up with a whopping scoop of the yellow stuff right on top.  Despite having said all this, I'm glad to hear of LoLo's expansion.  It could easily be like any other food chain that americans eat at everyday.  Go 'head wit'cha bad self, LoLo's, get your american dream!",

A place specializing in chicken and waffles? I'm there! But it was too far away to make just popping on down practical.   Then one day I was actually in the neighborhood and got a chance to go. The interior of the place is unique, with lots of interesting things to look at. There are several flatscreen TVs and the menus were fun.   The sheer amount of food you get is amazing. The chicken was almost exactly what my mom used to make when I was a kid. I wanted to have dessert afterward but filled up on the happiness that was the two-leg and a waffle combo. I had the blue drank, a mason jar of blue Koolaid that was endless. I didn't actually need a refill though. One jar was enough for me.   Our waitress was friendly and genuine. There was complimentary valet parking though we found a spot on the street easy enough. The overall atmosphere there was laid back and relaxing. I had a good time and great food. As I said before, I'd go there more often if it were only closer. If you've been thinking about trying this place, get off the fence and into the restaurant.",

So I read the reviews here on Yelp first like any good Yelp'r should & I was a little disappointed because I was expecting greatness & it was just good.  I would say a little better than Roscoe's (in L.A.) but not by much.   I've been to other restaurants that use Mason jars... so no big deal. The waffle was definitely good.  The smothered fried chicken was not bad but nothing great about it either...probably because it was luke warm nearing cold.  I ordered the Catfish Beignets as an appetizer expecting that something different...we'll they didn't come out as an appetizer but as a side order with my meal & they were just catfish strips.  I think it gets such great reviews because of the lack of competition.    45 minute wait (actually about 30) if you don't want to sit outside.  There's an outside waiting area adjacent to the outdoor dining which is a little confusing.  I'm told the place had really grown, & it does look great.

    "text": "I came here for lunch and it was packed so there was a half an hour wait but I was craving the chicken so I patiently waited the 30 long grueling minutes. The wait staff was very nice about it and came out frequently to seat people. There were outdoor seating areas that were empty that they should convert to dining spaces. When we were finally seated, the waitress was perky and ready to help. We ordered our Jar of Drank first. The koolaid was a bit warm with lots of ice and the lemonade had a crystal lite flavor to it. I ordered the 3 piece chicken with two waffles and eggs with cheese and onions and a side of grits. I do not like grits so I traded it for fries but they gave me rice instead... (must have been the loudness of the place). The chicken skin is so delicious and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. When you add their hot sauce the flavor is divine. The waffles have cinnamon and are nice and fluffy. I can't say much about the eggs and \"fries\" (rice) because they were pretty standard. I loved the foods they are known for but I would skip the extras. The price is not bad for the amount of food and the experience was nice.",

    "text": "I've been coming here since high school and this is THE spot in Phoenix for Chicken & Waffles. You have to go to the one downtown. I went to the Scottsdale location and it just wasn't the same. The original downtown location is in this old house, which is very cozy and inviting whereas the Scottsdale location is a huge space in a strip mall (though I heard they're moving locations?) where they are pumping out meals so I don't think the food is quite as good (it does comes out faster).  The fried chicken is crispy and delicious and the waffles are large thin but still have that crunch. The sides are also pretty good, especially the mac n cheese, but I usually don't have room for much more than the chicken and waffles. I go with the Lo-Lo's- 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Great sugary drinks in mason jars--sweet tea, lemonade, kool aid. Mmmm haven't been to Lo-Los in a while, just writing this makes me want to go back.",

I had never heard of chicken and waffles before and the thought intrigued me.  I went by myself to check it out before I told friends or brought anyone with me....pretty skeptical.   I was blown away!  The food was AMAZING, the service was phenomenal and all the staff was extremely warm and friendly.  I honestly felt like I was a guest at a friends home for dinner.  I have \"invited myself\" back several times since and has been phenomenal each time.",

I won't debate how it compares to chicken & waffles places in the South or in L.A., all I can say is that every meal I've had here has been terrific. Fried chicken is the perfect balance of crispy and juicy.  The cinnamon-y (is that a word?) waffles are tender and melt in your mouth. A nice splash of maple syrup and there's no need for the ice-cream-sized scoop[ of butter sitting on top.  Cornbread and sweet potatoes are also good. I'm not a fan of greens, okra or mac & cheese, but my family and friends vouch for their excellence. Service is always friendly. So, so good.",

    "text": "I invited my son's club basketball team to have dinner at Lolo's Chicken Waffles located in Phoenix on Saturday June 13th after our games. I had 20 people who RSVP'd to me that they would be coming so I called Lolo's Friday around 4:30 to make reservations because I know how busy that location gets on the weekend. I have made reservations at this location several times before and was told that there would be a $1.00 reservation per person but this time I was told that it would be $5.00 per person. I told the guy that took my reservation that it would not be a problem so he asked me for my credit card to make reservations for 20 people. I called back the next day (Saturday) at 1:50 because I had 7 more people that I had to add to our reservation and they said that would not be a problem they would just have to charge $5.00 per person to add them and I said that was fine because I knew even if we did not get that money refunded we would be spending at least that much. We had a great dinner and our waitress separated our bills like we asked when we had placed our orders. She came out gave everyone their bill and two people paid right away because they had to leave. When everyone else was ready to pay the waitress never came back so I had to go and find out what was going on. This is when I am finally being told that they had already charged my card for the entire party $541.00. I then told the Manager that we had asked for separate bills before we ordered. Then he says that I was charged $25.00 per person because I had made reservations. Well first if all if that was True the amount would not be $541.00 it would have been $500.00 for 20 people because they charged my card Friday the day before I even added the extra 7 people so that is a lie. Then I am being told that because I reserved the party room I was being charged some type of catering party package and they start showing me this contract that I have never seen before. I then tell Chris and the Manager that I did not ask to be put in a party room and if they chose to seat our large party there then that was their choice. I have made reservations there before for our company with large groups and it had never been an issue before. I then ask the waitress what the total bill was for our entire party and she says it was $440.00 so they are overcharging us $101.00! Then they tried to say it was because they charge $25.00 per person and I then told them if it would make sense for someone to make reservations for $25.00 per person when the most expensive item on the menu is $15.00, ridiculous! The manager then had to call the owner twice to explain the situation because they were not going to refund our money. After 40 minutes of him going back and forth on phone with the owner he finally got the approval to give us the refund. First I had to pay our tab which was over $200.00 and then because there were two families that had paid and left I had to pay their tabs too because they had issued a refund back to their cards because they actually thought that we were going to just pay the $541.00 like we were idiots! So I ended up paying $140.00 for those tabs as well. Then the manager goes to do our refund and he does not have the authorization to complete a refund for that amount, UNBELIEVABLE! So then we are told that we would get a call back on Sunday to get it taken care of and nobody calls us back so I have to end up calling them. I talked to Chris on the phone and he then tells me that the owners are on vacation and they will not be able to issue the refund until they come back to town. What kind of owners does not empower their managers to make decisions and issue refunds, but also what type of customer service is that! I ended up having over $800.00 taken out of our account just for dinner!! The account that was used belongs to our club team account that is a non-profit, so now our team is out $541.00 that is raised by the players with sponsorships and donations to use to pay for gym fees and tournaments and now we do not have those funds to use. That is not all, I then call another location and I am told that the owners are not on vacation and the only way to communicate with them is to go online and submit a request, even after we had given specific instructions to the managers Saturday night that we wanted a phone call from the owners. I sent this exact letter to the owners on their website like I was told and to this day I still have not received one response from anyone at Lolo's. I had to dispute the charges with my bank finally because our team needs the money to pay for our gym this week and a tournament. Don't ever trust Lolo's with your credit card because they will lie to you.",

So I thought I'd give it a chance. The prices were somewhat reasonable, I got the Lo-Lo's for $11 (2 waffles, and 3 pieces of fried chicken). The food was tasty for what it was, but I only give it 3 *'s because its just so unhealthy.. kool-aid, waffles, syrup, and fried chicken! This is the kinda a place I may go once a year, but I just feel so guilty!  Not sure what the syrup was, but it certainly wasn't real maple syrup (I'd imagine it is some sugar based creation), and the waffles were dry. The chicken wasn't very moist, it was also a bit on the dry side.",

You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle. I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's. It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul. I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced \"high-per-bowl\":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate. I am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater Phoenix Area. No, it's the people at Lolo's that make me go back, and the sense of belonging and of being one of the Lolo's \"pack\"...that and some of the best fried chicken, waffles, grits and cake that you will ever eat.

    "text": "For a long time I dreamed of going to Lo-Lo's.  I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be True.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.  Finding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.  Entering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.    The Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.  Service: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills.   Atmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.  Overall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.  Calorie content is... well...  it's not something I like to think about.",

I would think if you wanted to survive this economy, it may be wise to not only cater to the unemployed and retirees that have the luxury of enjoying breakfast after 9am. ? Don't most of us need to get to work by then?!?   Oh well, I'm sure a chicken and waffles spot will have plenty of success in SCOTTSDALE!",

The food was good, but more importantly, the staff was very polite, friendly and attentive. More restaurants need to take notes from Lo-Lo's customer service. I was greeted by three different people upon walking in. I feel like a lot of places lack that friendliness nowadays. Sometimes I feel lucky if someone even acknowledges my presence when I go out to eat.  As for the food, I ordered #10, side of mac & cheese and cornbread. I think I fell in love most with the chicken and corn bread. Also, the sweet tea is on point!  As I was shoveling food into my mouth, the owner or perhaps manager, comes up to me and asked \"you're eating alone?\" All I could do was giggle considering my mouth was full of fried chicken and mac & cheese. Sir, if I could've spoken at the time, I would've let you know that I would gladly sit alone, look like a loner and eat at your establishment because it's delicious.",

    "text": "If a half star could be given I would in the case of Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles.   I had heard about this place from someone at work who said he went there every Sunday after church. I was a little skeptical, but really wanted to try it. A date was set with a few of us from work and I couldn't wait. Sadly it was cancelled. Brad was sad :( But then Dallas G suggests we go there that same Friday night after a bunch of drinks. So Saturday morning I made the long trek from Cave Creek to downtown.   When I arrived I was a little worried about my car, but figured it's not worth anything anymore anyway. I only had to wait about 5 minutes as my 3 friends were already waiting for a bit. I had studied the menu online a couple of days prior and already knew what I wanted. So I got my Betty Boop, mac and cheese, and lemonade in the mason jar. My good buddy Z laughed at me a little for ordering the Betty Boop.   So the fried chicken breast, waffle, with the ice cream sized scoop of butter on it, come out, along with the mac & cheese. Needless to say the food was awesome! The waffle was buttery, a little cinnamony, and delicious. The chicken breast was good, a little dry, but I had no problem cleaning all the meat off. The mac & cheese was good too. The best part was when the bits of fried batter would fall off into some syrup. This is a dish unto itself. The salty and sweet were awesome. Reminded me of bacon and syrup.   Prices weren't high at all. Great place for some next day drinking recovery. I have been raving about it to all of my friends since. In fact, I think we will be going this Saturday.",

May not mean much to folks who've never been there but just know you're missing anything there.  Lo-Lo's is the new spot!! Food was great!!! Atmosphere was amazing, staff, music etc...  We got chicken n waffles, biscuits n gravy, grits, house potatoes and the French toast plate. All of the food was really good and flavorful. Sweet tea and kool-aid?!?!!!! Yum! And then you got the tv's so you can watch the games!! This place is a win on all fronts",

The waffles and chicken were very good.I believe that the whole menu will be good. I deceid to go with the dish that gave them their name and fame. The waffles have a Cinnamon, flavor that is not overpowering.   They sell t-shirts and I bought myself and daughter and Mom one.",

We had the chicken and waffles that is worth flying across the county just to have a meal. Chicken perfectly seasoned and crispy, but not oily. Don't know how they do it but Southern perfection.....oops sorry to my Southern brothers but Phoenix got Yo whooped#  Easily the best meal, let alone breakfast I've had in a long time.

I had the toy toy two wings with a waffle, one of the wings ended up on the floor so the waiter brought us two more so I ended up with three wings!!! Waitstaff was super nice joking around with everyone but got the job done! I wish my waffle was cooked a bit longer but that is my only complaint ... good stuff LoLos!!

She led us outside while on the phone. When we got to the patio area we found that there was not a table ready for ya to sit at. There was a young couple who looked to be finished sitting at two tables set up for 8 ppl. They seemed to be enjoying each other's company. She interrupted the end of their meal by moving their table aside, to pull our table away from theirs. They had to stand up and move their table 90 degrees just to make room. The hostess did not apologize or even seem to mind that she was inconsiderate to them. They didn't sit back down, they just left. We then sat and waited for a server. And waited.... and waited. About 15 minutes went by and we had not even had someone stop by to introduce themselves as our server. I then asked a busser/waiter who was clearing another table on the patio if \"we had a server out here\". He looked irritated that I asked and replied \"she will be out in a minute. What, did you want me to grab her for you?\" I replied, \"well we've been here for a while and haven't seen anyone. I was just making sure someone knew we were here\". With no response he went inside. We then got up and left. The food is always good at Lolo's. I had never been to this location, and won't be back. But that seems to be what their staff wants.",

When we ordered they ran out of Mac and cheese and had to select something else. That was a first for us. After our food came out, the waitress gave us good news. There was Mac and cheese and she brought us some. Definitely put smiles on our kiddos.",

Maybe it was it the fact that the food runner had to come take my order because he himself realized that the server he asked to come attend to me(I watched him ask a guy server to come take my order) ignored me, so he came over because he felt bad. Thank you to him, didn't catch his name but he was wearing a hat and was working his butt off. He got busy and forgot to grab my drink, not a big deal because he's clearly working hard. I flagged down the manager and explained that I had no actual server and wanted to actually order another plate because someone unexpectedly would be joining me. Finally I got the order taken with him... just to have him come back to ask me what I originally ordered (because it was never placed) and then had the original food runner guy come out to ask me again what I would like to order. It was a train wreck. I asked for cheese grits VERY well done and like usual I had to send them back because the cheese is barely cooked. I would hate to stop coming to this LoLos since I refuse to go to the Scottsdale location due to extreme lack of management and care from employees.",

Everything on their menu is delicious from the shrimp & grits the traditional kool-aide served in mason jars you come once & you'll be hooked!!! The chicken is always deliciously fried never too greasy now the Kool-Aid can be a little bit sweet but I always have them add a little sierra mist to it that kind of dilutes it a little,  Now for the cornbread it's all warm fluffy & buttery what more could one ask for. If you've never had shrimp and grits this is definitely the place to try it! Plump juicy seven jumbo shrimp spread over buttery creamy grits with bacon cheese,  Green onion I believe they also have a little bit of Tabasco or some type of seasoning that gives it a nice little kick!  One of the best homegrown family restaurants I've ever eaten at from the small little house to three locations downtown on Central in Scottsdale and also located in the Phoenix airport anytime you visit Arizona especially Phoenix make sure you plan on making it a stop that you can't pass by go in and indulge in all of the deliciousness",

I came in before 1 p.m. I waited until 1:16 p.m. I had to ask for a manager just for them to take my order then was told it would be 30 minutes wait. Not only did I wait 30 minutes I actually waited 47 minutes for the food to come out. I did remind them that I was on lunch more than once. They first overcharged me, if I hadn't looked at my receipt I would not have noticed it. Wben I got to work we discovered part of my order was cold the french fries. I ordered chicken and Waffles and received NO SYRUP. My chicken strips were overcooked dark brown in color. How can you eat chicken and waffles WITHOUT SYRUP?? I tried calling them and of course they don't answer. How and why did I wait sooooo long for cold fries and almost cold chicken strips?? While I was waiting another young woman was also waiting just to order a gift card. She said she had been waiting for 20 plus minutes.  She finally gave up after watching the waitresses go back and forth in the kitchen. I am completely appalled we didn't get any SYRUP for our meal!! We spent $50 and this is unacceptable.",

I ordered the 3 piece chicken and two sides, cornbread for $14, and paid $2 to upgrade to two chicken breasts. I placed my order and was excited to have some good fried chicken. The waitress left and 3 mins later she set my meal on the table. This did not make me happy, I wanted to wait, 10, 20, even up to 30 mins for my fried chicken. Not 3 mins, because I knew the chicken would not be fresh out of the fryer, and it wasn't. It was old, not juicy, and almost cold. I was like Im never coming back to this place. I ate the entire meal, because I was paying $16 dollars for it. The side items, collard greens and Mac and cheese were very good. The cornbread was excellent. The manager walked by me several times, but never asked how my meal was.   So I paid my $24, with tax and tip and Grape Kool aid and left, never to return. Lo Lo's you can't charge $16 for chicken that has been sitting around and expect your customers to come back.",

The Shrimp and Grits took a while to come out since it's made fresh so I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're crunched for time to catch a flight out like me.  Overall, the food was delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with anything here at Lo-Lo's. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it that I am sure is unique to Lo-Lo's, it's amazing.

My waffle was a different brown than everyone else's. No ones food came out like expected and the service just wasn't what is usually is. I won't be coming back to the central location any time soon. My visit to Lo Lo's in Vegas and Scottsdale was a totally different and great experience.",

Chicken had a great crust, moist but not dry.   Waffles were excellent.    Sides was the downer if I could pick out something.   I had the cornbread and it was a bit dry for me (I like the moist, honey version) and the greens weren't that spicy.    All of these were very, very minor the excellent food and service I had.   Top 2 Chicken and Waffles places I've had in the world.   Famous for: Chicken and Waffles",

I wish I could've tried their sweet tea but they were out when we ordered our food. We'll just have to come back and try again. Oh darn :) Overall, really great food. I'm a fan!",

We also ordered some cornbread to hold us over until the food got there and it was perfectly made.  We were there during the Sunday morning brunch rush, but the wait actually wasn't that bad.Unfortunately, the service, which wasn't great when it was the small house got much worse with the upgraded structure. The new building is great and the music really compliments the ambiance as well. Our drink order came out wrong (ice tea instead of hot tea) and when we told the server, she never fixed it. She took an additional 10 minutes to get our order after that. Once we got our meal, she never returned to ensure it was correct either. We asked for our check and ten minutes later she asked us if we wanted dessert and we had to ask for our check again. Eventually we got it from another server. It's a shame that the service doesn't reflect the quality of the food.",

    "text": "So I came to Phoenix 3 years ago for a business trip and had the chance to experience Lo-Lo's. I was so glad that my job was sending me back to Phoenix this month so I could once again experience this place! Imagine my surprise when I arrived in a taxi cab and the place was totally renovated! I mean it's larger, more modern looking and even has a patio. I was worried that the food might not be the same, but it was even better than I remembered. The menu is so extensive and everything looked and sounded good. I decided on 3 pieces of chicken, grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions and of course 2 waffles...oh and I had to add a salmon croquette. My coworkers got some of the same things along with fried catfish, mac and cheese and potato salad. We all enjoyed our food tremendously, but you know what else we loved?? The DRANKS! We started out with the Lemonade/Ice Tea mix, then moved on to the Blue Kool Aid and Lemonade mix. My coworker then got a Red, Grape Koolaid and Lemonade mix! Gosh how I love this place. Our server Carlos was awesome, so personable and stayed on top of everything we needed. The one last thing that made this place so awesome and made the dining experience one of the best was the music. Whatever Pandora station they have on rotation or whoever made their playlist is ON POINT! I was grooving the whole time I was eating, two my most favorite things in life, good food and good music.  Oh and how could I forget! I was too full, but best believe I took a piece of lemon cake home! Yessssssssssss Honey!!! Ate a little piece of it today, days later I might add and this is after I traveled back to the East Coast with it in my carry on (it's been in the fridge in between travelling time) and it definitely meets my expectations. Oh how I'll miss you Lo-Lo's I wish there was one in DC, until I see you again Phoenix!  Whether it had still been in that little shack of a restaurant or not, I will always come back to Lo-Lo's , but I'm so proud and happy for you in your new digs!!!",

Order a few things to get a sample, but you obviously have to get chicken and waffles.... they are good, really good.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The waffle was the size of my plate.  It was light and fluffy.  A little maple syrup... some hot sauce... Heaven I tell you!  I was so happy.  The mac and cheese was good... not great.  The corn bread was dense, but not overly so. The sweet tea was a bit too sweet and needs to be cut.  My wife ordered the salad.  It was delicious.  They were generous with the chunks of fried chicken and other toppings, with a nice portion of mixed greens.  This was one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix.",

Waiter greeted us nicely. Gave us a few mins to look over the menu. Waiter took our orders a few mins later. I order # 3 with watermelon Kool-Aid and my cousin ordered chicken strips. I wasn't too sure what was going on. It took 35 mins for our food to come out. That's unacceptable! At any restaurant. Especially if the restaurant isn't busy.  Timed passed the waiter only came to check on us twice. It was not the waiter who took our order who checked on us. People came in after us got done eating  before we got our food. The wait time killed the whole experience. Couldn't enjoy the food like I wanted too. Overall I have to give this location 1 star.",

    "text": "The food is good.  You know that already based on the other reviews.  With that said, our experience here was terrible.  Here's how it went down: we arrive, put our name in and wait a very reasonable 10 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we went through the menu and chose what to order.  10 minutes goes by.  Then 15 minutes - not a single staff member appeared.  We were being totally ignored.  I started checking Yelp for nearby restaurants and planning our escape from what looked to be an impending \"major fail.\"  Then suddenly our waiter appeared and was apologetic.  We were nice in return.  He blamed his slowness on a nearby table that was \"being difficult\" (tacky) and took our drink orders.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Then 15.  Finally he shows up with our drinks and says nothing - just throws them down.  Weird.  He was having a bad night and we were paying the price.  Before he has another chance to run off, I politely tell him we'd like to get our order in.  He takes our order and runs off again saying very little.  25 minutes pass before he brings out the appetizer.  Then another 20 minutes later our entrees appear.  The whole time he's being as scarce as he possibly can and saying as little as possible every time he appears. Finally whilst eating our food another member of the staff (Susan) drops by and is quite helpful.  She refills our drinks and takes the long-devoured appetizer plate away.  She stops by several times to ask if we need anything.  Good job, Susan!  Unfortunately she turns our table back over to our original waiter who (after another unreasonably long wait) ended up bringing out the check.  He had nothing else to say.  Pretty astounding service for a restaurant that charges $20+/plate (and - based on the mandatory Valet parking - would like to charge more).  As we looked at the final bill at the end of the (long) night, everyone felt cheated by the stunning lack of service.  I'm too nice to stiff someone on the tip, but I came darn close here.  We will not be back.  If you're in the area and need to spend $15-20 for some fried chicken and [carbs], go check out \"Welcome Chicken + Donuts\" instead.",

    "text": "The food here is great, and the service was lovely.  My only challenge was the Scottsdale dj booth that played the music so loudly we couldnt talk.  When we first entered I noticed the sound was pretty loud so we asked to be seated in a quieter part of the restaurant.  It didnt help.   We shared the green bean appetizer to start, and it was quite good.  Crispy, not greasy and the sauce was a great accompaniment.  Have tried their foods a few times and am always impressed with vegetable sides.  Their greens are incredible and I always enjoy the grits.  Ive been told by the servers that the greens are not made with any meat, but the flavor is impressive. Malazia's Focheezy Juicy Hood Burger was tasty, we also tried the traditional chicken and waffles which are always a good choice.  All the food we tried was well prepared and enjoyable.  Having tried the Banana Puddin in the past, we knew it to be a great end to our meal, but none of us had room to eat it.   I will go back to the Central Phoenix location again, and may even try Scottsdale during the day to see if the music is turned down at all.  We all enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying it again!",

Even though another table that was sat after us and was a much bigger party got their food first which was odd because we were very hungry and already unhappy that day. But when we finally got our food, it was so good and worth every penny. The waiter was great and will definitely go back when I am in the Phoenix area.",

I wanted to sit outside and while we were waiting to be served there were two wonderful ladies that were eating their meals and we all had a good conversation. They talked very highly about your restaurant and I couldn't wait to eat. Very good customer service and atmosphere. I'm not going to write a book but let me tell you when I bit into the chicken and waffles OMG SOOOOOO GOOD!  My favorite place to go! We will be back real soon!",

    "text": "I checked this restaurant out last year the last time I was working in Phoenix. I really wanted Chicken & Waffles for breakfast and the Clarendon Hotel I was staying at used to have this item on their menu. Since I had the craving for Chicken & Waffles the nice staff at the hotel recommended Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. I was not disappointed, the food was amazing, the service was attentive and friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the over one hour wait to get a table. After being seated in the restaurant I can see why seating is an issue, this place is a converted small house and the dining area is limited. The Fried Chicken & Waffles my friend and I had along with the cornbread, mac n cheeze and the Iced tea & Lemonade combo was off the hook. I will be in the Phoenix area again this weekend and since reviewing this restaurant here I noticed a new Lolo's location in Scottsdale which I will be hittin\" up!",

After the wait, we were allowed inside and we were starving.  We were instantly greeted by the owner/manager Larry White and he wasted no time getting us some sweet tea and Kool-Aide (I wish every place served Kool-Aide).  We both got the Lo Lo's plate which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 2 large waffles.  The food came out quickly and we didn't waste anytime chowing it down. The chicken was fantastically seasoned and breaded and the waffles were outstanding.  We were very satisfied with our meal and preceeded to the Suns game. Although the Suns lost by 30 points to the Pistons, the trip from Tucson was well worth it because of Lo Lo's.",

    "text": "My Southern credentials may not match up to other Yelpers, my great great grand uncle from Pennsylvania fought on the wrong side in the \"War of Northern Agression\".  I spent 5 years in the capital of the South, beautiful Richmond VA.  I met the most wonderful people in Richmond and in a short time I learned to appreciate  collard greens, red beans, grits and super sweet iced tea.  I hate to say they have the best fried chicken in Phoenix here because some Yelpers will go in with unrealistic expectations and be disappointed.  I will say that when I must have fried chicken, Lo-Lo's is at the top of my list.  The tables and chairs are packed in tightly, and it gets very crowded and noisy on the weekends, but this is part of the experience.  The wait staff is very efficient, so don't expect an overly warm greeting or the royal treatment like you get in Scottsdale.  I love coming here for Sunday brunch.",

They had some damn good mac and cheese. i ordered the lolos special, i think it was the #3 anyway, the chicken was real tasty and so were the waffles. Bring a camera when you come to this place because it has a real novelty aspect to it, this place might be a 5 star, but my waffle house experiences are close to none existent but i will edit my review if need be once i frequent more of these type places. Oh and they give you your drink in a big kerr canning jar 'pretty cool'",

The chicken was very good.  They pulled a Church's number and added parts of the breast to every wing, giving you a big piece of meat.  The breading was tasty and the meat was moist and juicy.  However, that was where it ended for me.  The waffle was okay, it had a cinnamon taste to it that was different but it was very thin and small (maybe I am just used to Roscoe's).  The mac and cheese was very rich but too rich.  I was basically cheese sauce with some macaroni thrown in.  I couldn't complete the whole thing.  I was just about on my way out the door when I saw someone's sweet potato pie.  I turned back around and ordered one for dessert.  Shouldn't of done that.  I was not impressed with the taste so that was wasted also.  I would stop here for the chicken but I am not pressed to try anything else.",
