    "text": "I've given this place multiple second chances because the food is amazing. The first time I ate here, I was thrilled. I thought I'd finally found my go-to sushi spot in my neighbourhood. Everything was wonderful! The server, the food, the price. Naturally, I came back a second time.  The second visit was barely a shadow of the first. I actually watched a waitress spill an entire glass of cola down a customer's shirt. Instead of staying calm and apologizing, she immediately turns around and literally begins to SCREAM at her co-workers for not cleaning up her mess. It was one of the most embarassing and unprofessional situations I've witnessed in a long time. She also happened to be our waitress unfortunately, and she completely forgot about us. I think it took her twenty minutes to bring us utensils and water after we had been seated, even though we were one of three tables in the entire restsurant. She was not polite and generally pretty terrible at her job.The food was still great, so I only tipped the chefs. The third and final attempt to eat here was the last straw.  I walk in with my fiance. It's moderately busy but not hectic. The hostess does not greet me after several minutes of standing and waiting patiently. After I ask for a table she waves her hands towards the bar without looking up from her ipad, and says that we can seat ourselves. There was only one seat open at the bar. I ask for a table for two, again she just waves her hand.  A different hostess walks us towards another table and chucks our menus on it before she walks away. The table was completely covered in the meal of the previous diners and obviously hadn't been wiped down. I left. So disappointed.  I feel terrible for their chefs. They've permanently lost my business due to their rude and negligent waitstaff.",

Most recently I made a reservation for a larger party of friends and they were able to accommodate us and we're absolutely the best! They allowed us to store out cake and ice cream in their fridge and freezer for the birthday we enter celebrating. Then, as our party got bigger than expected they kept finding ways to make our seating workout. They helped us, then, serve our cake and ice cream. they're fantastic and exceeded my expectations for the night. Staff was so nice and helpful and we felt like they genuinely just wanted us to have a good time and we absolutely did!",

    "text": "Decent quality sushi. That comes to you. Constantly and without much waiting.... Need I say more?  I've been a fan of Sushi Station since I started going to the location up at Desert Ridge. Driving down Camelback and seeing this location was now open was music to my ears (sometimes the 30 minute drive up North just doesn't seem worth it).  This location seems more spacious than the other - and included all my go-to favorites (there's one spicy shrimp roll I can't get enough of) as well as some new delights. I especially enjoy getting to try several small bites of different things without it breaking the bank - although I've been known to go a little HAM and eat a few too many plates when hungry. My record so far is ~$36 in plates that don't cost more than ~4 a piece. Care to challenge my mad sushi eating skills?  The one critique I might make - I LOVE yellowtail. And although you can order items not on the conveyor belt that do have yellowtail, they aren't typically included in the standard rotation and finding your waitress can be a little challenging if they're especially busy. Regardless, 4 well deserved stars.",

This is not one of those new trendy sushi bars where young people go to drink and then get a California roll and say \"they love sushi\". This is a simplistic spot with real sushi, sashimi and rolls. Nothing fancy to it (except the revolving runway of food in front of you). Loved the simplicity of the pricing as well. Each plate color means a price.  White= $1.75 Blue= $2.25 Green= $3.25 Yellow= $4.25 Black= $5.25   Overall pretty great place to get sushi and good prices!",

    "text": "I kept hoping for a conveyor belt sushi restaurant to open in Central Phoenix, and we now have one. Sushi Station has the typical offerings of most conveyor belt places, lots of fried stuff and California roll variations. I usually go with the nigiri for a healthier option, where you can actually taste the fish. It's not the best sushi in Phoenix, but the price is obviously the trade off, and everything I've had has been fresh. I've ordered the Oshi pressed sushi with both the tuna and yellowtail and it was delicious. It's nice to have fresh made-to-order options along with the grab-and-eat. Service had always been pleasant and friendly, though a little slow at times when they get busy. This is a great place if you're looking for a reasonably priced healthy meal that wont break the bank.",

But once their it was a new system for me as a New Yorker to accept. They way of offering their sushi was on a belt that has the food going around the entire restaurant. You could pick out what ever you want to eat.. I didn't find a lot of options on it.. It was more likely made to serve what the majority wanted or what they had an overstock of. We seen a lot of eel on the plates and I don't like eel. Of course you can order from the menu which they gave out at the beginning. The cool part is you don't have to wait for the food the food is already on a belt coming around passing your table the moment you are seated. Service was a bit slow.. Needed improvement but over all of those never experience the new belt system of serving food.. You enjoy the experience the first time & the second time you realize the need of improvement on their service end.  Happy eating!",

    "text": "After out running errands last Sunday, my eldest college-aged son kept mentioning that the Sushi Station was open. He wanted to check it out.  I was a bit apprehensive. I've known about the previous restaurants that have been at that location. Guess what? This is not a greasy, bulk food buffet!                                             I was feeling a bit peckish and  disappointed that our usual sushi joint wasn't running their happy hour specials but the others sushi eaters in the house convinced me to go.        So did the customer who was just leaving, saying: \" This was my first time here and I like sushi. I was pleasantly surprised. You're going to love it!\"  When you go in, you pass by cool marble and a Zen water fountain. The inside has been tastefully updated with rice paper lanterns, Koi paintings, Feng shui  colors and strategically placed tables and booths around the sushi conveyor belt. There were 3 to 4 sushi chefs preparing different bite size plates of all sorts of sushi goodness. They had many different types of roles, pairs including seared tuna, salmon, octopus, squid, shrimp, yellow tail, snapper. Even the more exotic things like  sea cucumber. Many vegetarian delights as well like seasoned seaweed, spring rolls, bean curd, asparagus rolls,tamago, miso soup. Our favorites included: the lady roll, the spider roll, the Grand Canyon, the rainbow roll. And most of all, our way cool waiter Travis. Travis was super attentive, patiently explaining how the sushi station works. He made great menu suggestions on what to try. The nice thing is if you didn't care for any of the sushi rolling past you, and how could you not. We were eating with our eyes! :-) They have a full menu of other tasty hot and cold meals to try. They have a good selection of beer, sake, and soft drinks. Prices from the conveyor belt vary on the plate color with white being a $1.75. To the most expensive plate being $5.25. You stack your finished plates on the table and they tally it up at the end.                                             Thank you Sushi Station. We sounded just like that happy customer we passed on our way in. We told the same things to the new customers we are passing on the way out. We will be back!",

    "text": "I've never been to one of these cool conveyor belt places before. With a clientele that clearly overlapped with Golden Corral's, and patrons cycling out almost as fast as the food, I was skeptical. Once I was seated, I was hesitant to grab anything. The concept was so new to me! There were so many choices, I had an overload.   I think this is a very good format for those wanting to try a vast variety of sushi and a well-balanced meal. Start out with a seaweed salad for $1.75, move on to a few 3-4 piece rolls of decent quality for $3.25 each (look out for good specials on nigiri!), and finish off the night with something like a generous piece of cheesecake for another $2.25. You'll be more than satisfied for around 20 bucks.   I think this is also a good format if you wanna be a n00b and gorge yourself on the oversupply of California roll variations for just over 2 bucks a pop. Just go nuts, you'll be up to your eyeballs in surimi and spicy mayo in no time. I think too many of the rolls are essentially the same.   What I don't think this is good for is for anyone looking for heaping portions of good quality sushi. For the price of 2-3 premium plates, you could just go to a traditional sushi bar and get something better. I'd say that's about the limitation of this place.   Overall, this is a fast and fun dinner option for casual customers. It's a great option to dine on cheap rolls. It's not-so-good for those with really high standards (for either quality or creativity). Just...do it the way I do it and you'll be happy.",

The sushi reminded me of sad pre-packaged grocery store sushi. I wasn't super hungry, so I was able to walk out of the restaurant for under $10 (getting 2 basic rolls). However, my dainty male friend  was still hungry after spending over $20.  Despite the sad sushi and questionable value, I would have given Sushi Station a generous 3 star rating....until they decided to give me an uninvited shower. One of the servers spilled an entire pitcher of ice water on my back. I totally get that mistakes happen, so after the initial shock of having freezing cold water poured all over me I tried not to overreact. The thing that really upset me was the lack of apology from anyone working at the restaurant. No one asked if anything in my purse had been damaged or even if I needed some paper towels! Drenched with ice cold water, I sat there for about 5 minutes before my friend could finally flag someone over to get me paper towels.",

    "text": "It's sushi on a conveyor belt! So this is a concept I'm not new to and is usually one that provides subpar sushi.  I was looking for a quick spot for dinner with my mom and brother after work, so we decided to stop in. The place was crowded, but not packed and was seated promptly.  Different plates indicate different prices, there are names with ingredients next to the plates and all condiments are given at the tables like Ginger, Wasabi and Soy Sauce. You may order off the menu if items on the belt aren't sufficient.  We ended up grabbing different rolls and found some to be way better (more expensive plates), most are filled with fake crab or deep fried. I don't remember the names of which ones we liked best, but the items with spicy tuna or fresh salmon were all pretty good. The only con was that often the same sushi rolls would make rounds, while we waited for something new to come around. I appreciated that they use little plastic \"lids\" instead of saran wrap or leave them exposed to air. They also serve edamame and little desserts on the belt as well, but we passed on those. The plates range from $1.75 to $6 which is very reasonably priced. For three people we ended up leaving pretty full and paying only around $40! There is a happy hour you can also take advantage of from Sunday- Thursday 3-6pm!  Service is okay, it's pretty much a self service type of place. The only time we talked with our server was just to get our waters filled and for our check.",

Please get out more.  If you like revolving sushi bars, you'll like the selection at Sushi Station. They have more variety than some of the other places in town. It's cheap, it's fast, and the sushi is pretty good. I went twice in one weekend, because my boyfriend was sad I didn't go with him the first time.   I gave this place 5 stars, because it is damn good for what it is. Sushi isn't automatically good or bad based on it's location and I wish more people could get that through their thick skulls.  Lastly, if one more person complains about imitation crab while simultaneously complaining that prices are too high ... my head is going to explode from trying to process all the stupidity. Who cares? If you are ordering a California roll ... you are a basic bitch anyway.",

My sister wanted siracha sauce so she asked a waitress for some and she said she was going to tell our server, she never mentioned it to her so I had to ask the waitress that checked up on us and she immediately got it for us.

In my opinion, Sushi Station is best for a girls' night or guys' night out, or a family dinner with the kids (who would enjoy the novelty of revolving sushi). It's not a particularly elegant location if you're looking for a date spot. It's not the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, but the experience is well worth the trip, in my opinion.

I have ordered a few things off the menu (the Las Vegas roll is so so so good, as is the fried rice) and most recently, my server Tom was excellent and attentive and funny. If you see something on the belt or the menu you like, but want to change something new, they are accommodating and quick. The only reasons this isn't a 5 star review is that it normally takes quite a while to get served and the most recent visit, I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs and other servers were passing plates back and forth between us while we were eating. A little odd. All in all, I really enjoy this place and will definitely come back.",

There were a continuous line of rolls. I, however, am not a fan of rolls so I tried their menu and found sashimi to my delight. The fish was fresh and there was lots of it. The prices are great. We actually ate more than we would normally order at a regular sushi bar and came out $20 cheaper, including tip, than normal. The service was great and the noise was bearable. I'll be back!",

What I found a bit irritating is that they place a sign on the sidewalk advertising Happy Hour at certain times of the day, on days that there is no Happy Hour. It says somewhere on the sign that the Happy Hour is not available on certain days, although the sign is out on those days. So it's certainly not False advertising, just misleading and irritating. I guess there is something to be said for reading the fine print.",

Me and my friend wanted a slice of cheesecake, and ordered a piece, the waiter told us that its in the freezer so it might be cold. we had said that was fine. When we got it it was hard as a rock, not because it was cold, but because it was VERY stale and old :( ew. The manager came and took the cheesecake away and denied it was old, but said it was hard because it was in the freezer, but the cheesecake wasn't even cold.",

It takes awhile for someone to come over with drinks and wasabi, which prevents you from eating. They also do not come back to check on you at all, the sushi chef noticed we didn't have any water left and waved for a server to come over, and the waitress was on the phone gossiping while filling up our waters. Then after 15 minutes of sitting around I finally flagged down our waitress to get our checks. I do not think it is individual servers but simply the way they were trained by the manager. we come because we enjoy the price and variety of sushi. But only come if you are in no rush.",

I won't explain the concept because I'm sure several others have done so.  Sushi Station has a lot of options, rolls and nigri that will appeal to most.  I like their salmon nigri best myself.  If you want something not from the conveyor belt you can order directly as well.  Their happy hour deals are fab.  I come here with my husband and my small child.  She loves to watch the conveyor belt go around, and pick out what she wants.  Conveyor belt-style sushi means a quick meal...you grab food off the belt, so you can start eating right away.  You can easily be in and out for lunch or a quick bite before a movie.  My family of 3 ate heartily, including large beers for the adults, at happy hour recently and our bill was under $40.  What a deal.  Fun, tasty, affordable fast-casual fresh sushi, what's not to like?  If you want fancy haute cuisine, look elsewhere....if you want cheap and fun sushi that will even entertain your child, give this place a go.",

My husband and I have eaten here several times, leaving stuffed and fulfilled each time.  Their specialty seems to be fried sushi such as dragon rolls, but everything we've tasted off the belt has been acceptable, and we haven't even felt the need to order anything off the menu.  Even after several trips we haven't sampled everything, not even close. Kitchen and bathroom appear relatively clean too, which is particularly important for a sushi restaurant.  This place isn't high end or gourmet by any means, just common sushi products with a dizzying array of creative and tasty variations.  Fantastic place for lunch or casual dinner.",

OUTSTANDING!  In Japan carousel sushi is typically the cheapest, and lowest quality.  Ditto for the revolving sushi places I've been in America, like the one out on Bell road.  But not Sushi Station.  Their fish is incredibly fresh.  Their rolls are unique, like the Tempura California roll.  Or the Crab stuffed Jalapeno popper.  Seaweed salad is good.  A lot of Unagi (eel) rolls that rock. Their faux crab stuffing is definitely superior to others, perhaps they mix in some real crab.  It's not goopy, loaded with mayo like most, even upscale sushi houses.  Get there before five and you can have a fantastic AND highly affordable meal.  You pay per plate at a rotisserie Sushi place, certain color plates are certain prices.  But hey, it's ALL affordable here, esp at happy hour.  My buddy, a professional chef AND sushi gourman like myself, we couldn't wait to go back after a single visit.  For the two of us, plus 3-4 items \"to-go\" for his sick GF, we spent $40, not including any alcohol, not happy hour either.   Very reasonable, IMHO, for first rate sushi.  Like Schwarzenegger sez, \"I WILL BE BACK!\"",

Finally when the check time came, when we asked her for it, she made a rude remark about how she \"heard us already\".

The service is consistently poor and awkward. I'll admit the servers are kind of set up for failure at a place like this, because many customers are just helping themselves from the selections on the conveyor belt. And then there are other customers (like me) who want to order off the menu. So I'm sure it's hard from the servers to adjust to everyone's different dining styles here. However, we ALL still want our drinks refilled, our checks brought out in a timely manner, and friendly greetings/interactions. And each of these things have been lacking almost every time I've been here. Our servers often completely disappear for a very long time, and we have to track them down for our check by asking other servers. Not cool.  Normally, I really like sushi. But at Sushi Station I don't think the quality of fish is very good. It has a very off taste to m, though that's exactly what I expect at an inexpensive revolving sushi bar. After trying a number of weird-tasting dishes from the conveyor belt, I've now gotten into the habit of just ordering veggie rolls from the menu, and I do think these are decent. They're nothing special, just straight up cucumber or avocado rolled in rice and seaweed; but I like them and would recommend them.  Sushi Station does have a rewards program, so that makes me feel a teeny bit better about eating here so frequently.   I could forgive the quality of the fish (since now I just order my veggie rolls) if the service were even reasonable, or if the place had a more pleasant environment. But unfortunately all of these things combined just make it an experience I don't enjoy. But if you're like my husband and just want all the sushi you can get by any means necessary, you'll probably be a fan.",

Third time, I went in and they didn't have 1 of the 3 things I ordered but didn't bother telling me in advance, so I had to wait for them to prep something new.

Because it's revolving, the plates are small and you get to try whatever you want. The prices per place range from about $1.50-4.50 and they're usually about 4 pieces. They also have a happy hour with even lower prices.    The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the atmosphere is so basic (which doesn't bother me, but I don't want my rating to be misleading).

    "text": "First time at Sushi Station.  Kids brought me here for Fathers Day and by the time we left at 5 (we came during happy hour) it was 3/4 full.   The variety at SS is adequate, with a 100 foot long conveyor winding thru half of the restaurant. The sushi chefs constantly work to keep it stocked with everything from California rolls, spider rolls, Sexy rolls, edamame plates, jalapeno poppers and a couple dozen more types.  The value is not as top notch as you would experience at a traditional sushi bar: the rolls have more rice and less filling but they tasted fresh.   I read a lot of reviews regarding poor service. Ours couldn't have been better. Our server brought wasabi, ginger and drinks plus she checked on us numerous times, kept our drinks full and kept our table clear of excess.   Sushi Station is certainly a gimmick but it is a fun place to gather for fanciful sushi. The greatest advantage is that you get to see and try pieces you always wondered about but didn't want to spend $8 for a whole roll. It's only $1.25-$4.25 per four pieces here.",

You walk in, your seated, and then you get to experience the Sushi station's revolving conveyor belt of goodness! Everything tastes amazing and is so fresh! Their sushi selection consists of anything and everything you can think of. From Las Vegas roles, to sashimi, to California roles, Phoenix Roles, Spicy Tuna and everything in between. And all are priced between $2- $5 a plate and during happy hour they are .50 cent off!! Each plate has abou 4 to 6 rolls, so you only need 4 or 5 plates to get full, so not bad for a light lunch or dinner.  Also, if there is something you want that you cannot find on the belt you can order it from their extensive menu! They have tons of sushi and other types of dishes on their menu! I definitely recommend Sushi Station for fresh and a wide variety of sushi items!! Happy Hunting!",

Prices of the food are determined by the color of the plates. I had a California rolls with crab on it. Yum! Try to get the bigger ones first. The tiramisu is delicious! So yummy! Also the cheese cake bites are to die for. I loved the raspberry cheesecake. I had four different dishes for a total of $11. This is a great place to go in the midst of a shopping spree or after Last Chance! The wait staff are extremely nice and attentive; they even asked if we wanted a fork to eat our desserts. Loved that. I would go back in a second!",

The conveyer belt concept is great, you can try a huge variety of sushi you may not otherwise want to commit to just looking at the menu. Everything we had was fresh, but we were eyeballing what was coming out fresh. No complaints, the prices were reasonable and i enjoyed everything I tried, as did my friend. My particular favorites were the squid salad, and the salmon and tuna sashimi and my plain friend liked the california roll and arizona roll. The sake was nice too, but would recommend buying it on happy hour as it was a bit expensive, like $9, so yeah happy hour. Anyway will be back again, for happy hour next time!",

Nothing makes me look forward to eating sushi, more than seeing strangers take the food off of the conveyer belt, open the lid, breathe on it, put their germs on the food, sometimes even touch it, then put the lid back over the food, and put the plate back in the conveyer belt!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because you can order take out and don't have to worry about the disgusting patrons of this restaurant personally contaminating your food. I would only ever order out food from here if I was going to eat here ever again, because watching how this place lets your food be handled is not only unappetizing, but flat out repulsive. Don't eat inside this restaurant unless you prefer your sushi with lots of bacteria and a hint of influenza!",

It's definitely the best bang for your buck when it comes to sushi. The revolving counters are pretty cool especially if you have never been to one. Mass amounts of various rolls and items rotate by you and you just grab the plate of whatever items you like. Plates range from $2-$5 based on plate color and have 4-5 pieces each. Me and my girlfriend came here and between the two of us had about 10 plates total and the bill with drinks came to $30 (which is the equivalent to maybe 3 rolls at a more upscale sushi bar like Ra or Koi). It definitely offers up a great way to try a wider variety of rolls and sushi. They even have a happy hour which is 50cents off each plate. So if you are craving sushi and want something not as expensive and much quicker than traditional place, would definitely recommend.",

Prices on the belt range from $1.75 - $6. The plates are color coordinated, so there's really no confusion! They also have a full menu you can order separate dishes off of that isn't priced bad either.  There are a few vegan/vegetarian options on the revolving sushi belt too, which I thought was cool.  We got the Edamame, Asparagus Roll, Sweet Potato Roll, this bean curd thing that is not featured on the menu (it was good though!) and a plate of vegetable Yaki Soba noodles (from the menu). All of which was very good! Our total was under $20 for 2 people!  The service isn't the greatest, but you ARE pretty much serving yourself, so it wasn't a huge deal. All the servers there were very nice and always keeping up tables/sushi belt.  I recommend it and would definitely go back.",

However, I do not appreciate the way I was treated at Sushi Stations newest location on camelback.   I dropped into Sushi Station on camelback with my significant the other night. The place was pretty busy but we were attended to and seated promptly. Our server was a very nice young woman. About 7 minutes went by and my girlfriend and I had yet to get sushi off the belt that we wanted. It was just too busy and our central position enabled others to get the more popular sushi options first. This is understandable.. But we were having a craving for #delux.... So, we decided to get up and leave. Which last time I checked is not illegal. We had nothing but waters and no pending orders. What followed next is why I am posting this.  I heard a comment coming from behind me. I turn around and it was one of the sushi chefs. He then obnoxiously says 'thank you' like a freaking valley girl in front of a full house of people. I kept walking and did not entertain the rudeness and unprofessionalism.   I noticed the attitude and don't tolerate stuff like this from children with a sushi knife...  I won't come back until I get an apology from that chef. Pity because you guys are right down the street from us. We had been to this location a total of 6 times already.   Just dumb.  **still waiting on apology**",

Then within a few hours the stomach issues hit and lasted for 3 days. I can't 100% place the blame here but considering my previous few meals were homemade leftovers from the 2 days prior I would be hard pressed to think that was it.  Also the wait staff seemed disoriented and weren't very attentive for simple things like drinks and dishes for soy sauce.

Good sushi, and the ginger was abundant. The conveyor device was fun to watch. Empty spaces were quickly refilled. They also have sashimi, and I was served my favourite salmon. Fun place. They also have tradituional hot dishes as well, for hose who are not sushi fans, so everyone is satisfied.  The only drawbacjk was I wish the seats were a bit higher.",

    "text": "Finally - a revolving sushi bar in central Phoenix, conveniently located on Camelback near 16th Street  at the eastern end of car-dealership row and with ample parking at the back. The place is very clean and spacious, the staff is very attentive, and the sushi chefs are efficient at replenishing the items on the conveyors. The sushi items themselves are very fresh and there is a wide variety to choose from. As with all revolving sushi restaurants, the prices of the items are indicated by the colors of the plates. For this one, white = $1.75,  blue = $2.25, green = $3.25, yellow = $4.25, and black = $5.25.  The prices, of course, vary with the ingredients and the preparation, from basic inexpensive salmon to more intricate rolls with multiple ingredients including octopus or sea urchin. Expect to see popular familiar items such as shrimp nigiri and spider rolls as well as atypical offerings such as Arizona roll and Explode roll (crawfish salad with spicy crabmeat, avocado, and eel sauce). In all, it's a fun and satisfying dining experience with  prices that are very reasonable for the quality of the food.",

Japanese-style conveyors shuttle an extensive variety of delicious dishes around the room and you take a plate at your leisure...what's not to like?    The quality is surprisingly excellent considering the landlocked metropolitan area, and the offerings change by the minute for the more indecisive among us. Classic rolls, specialty nigiri, superb dumplings, side salads & multicultural desserts, just choose whatever plate strikes your fancy and devour!!  Take out is available but the novelty and the fun is lost completely. All-in-all this place simultaneously delivers a great meal and experience, I will gladly return for another round soon.   Only cons to consider are the sub-par service and the quality of chopsticks, but otherwise a worthy and worthwhile culinary endeavor.",

We were seated at a corner area at the sushi bar. From our spot they loaded freshly made sushi. Yellow plates are 4.50, green 3.50, blue 2.50.  From what we tried we liked the dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, and the salmon nigiri. The quality is A-okay! This is typical for most revolving sushi places. The desserts didn't look that great. We stuck more with the yellow plates and were happy with them.   For two people we had about 36 pieces for a good deal. There weren't too many exciting rolls but for a cheap filling lunch with your friends or coworkers this is a place to go!   Over all this place is 3.5 we didn't  come in with high expectations for the food but were left satisfied. They could improve on service, they didn't  fill our water but the owner on the assembly line close to us helped us. And the sushi chef was nice. Thanks sushi station!",

The quality of sushi isn't bad. Actually pretty good and tasty. You just grab your sushi and eat. They also have a menu if grabbing sushi off a conveyer belt isn't your thing. The customer service kinda sucks but I promise you only see your waiter once or twice to get your drinks and to count your plates in order to bill you. Bring a friend or two. There is plenty of space! They accept cash and credit and there is a yummy icecream place attached next door.",

The sign at the door said to please seat yourself however the guests before us were directed to seats so I asked the who I thought to be the manager if we were to wait to be seated. We were ignored at first and then I asked again and she said she would seat us.  Once we got sat it took a moment for our waitress to come over to us and give us plates and take our drink order. We both just asked for water. After she dropped the plates my boyfriend and I started to grab sushi and eat because we were both hungry. A considerable amount of time had passed and our waitress had yet to come back with our drinks. By this point we were both pretty thirsty and gave it a few more moments in the hops our waitress would come back. She didn't. I being a waitress myself who had just gotten off  work finally had it. I started looking around for the manager again and happened to catch the eye of the woman taking care of us. We finally got our waters. I asked for the manager because I was upset that we were thoroughly forgotten about. She grabbed the manager and proceeded to stand behind her while I tried to express how upset I was. Well what should have been a free meal ended up being a 10% discount. Needless to say I won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone and won't be going back.",

The rolls and speciality beverages, desserts and appetizers are placed on small plates and put on an \"conveyor belt\" this pushes the food around the restaurant and allows you to simply pick up what you want. It's nice to see your food before you get it! Also, if they don't have what you want you can order it right off the menu, and it's more than just sushi , the menu consists of rice, chicken and \"cooked food\" for those who don't like it raw.

Those prices are extremely good. I love the conveyor belt and it's awesome that they cover the sushi to avoid others who may be a little touchy. I wish the shrimp tempura roll didn't have a huge piece of imitation crab and maybe a little more spice to the spicy ahi and not grinding it up. Other than that, I'd definitely be back here again. Not sure what people didn't like about the customer service but I thought it was good. Many have an Asian accent which I can see being a little difficult for others, but everyone was definitely friendly. I wish they weren't so far away from where I am though.

    "text": "I came to this location about a week ago just on a whim. I love revolving sushi bars and I'm always up for a new experience and my favorite revolving sushi bars is about 15 miles away from my house so seeing another revolving sushi bar in my area I decided why not. The atmosphere was nice, but that's about where all the good things end.   I started off by ordering in iced green tea and I grabbed one of my favorite types of sushi the Philly roll. The cream cheese in this role was the majority of the role. The cream cheese overtook the flavor of everything else. Next I grabbed some at a edamame which was thoroughly undercooked and pre-salted. I personally don't mind having the salt on there but I know some people wouldn't like it salted. I'm sure you could ask for it unsalted but at a revolving sushi bar it's all about getting it from the conveyor belt. Next I tried a Las Vegas roll which had no flavor whatsoever. Next was a tuna roll and the tuna tasted like it was dropped on the floor. At this Time I asked the waitress where the restrooms were and they were all the way on the other side of the restaurant which you literally had to go through a maze to get to. After spending about two minutes in the restroom I came back and my place was already given to another customer. If it wasn't for the fact that I consider myself to be a good person I would've walked out without paying.  When it comes to revolving sushi bars do not waste your time at this location. I will continue spending my money and enjoying Teharu sushi in Tempe rather than go to this place again.",

Sushi is good but because it's on a conveyer belt, you should know what you want. Everything is simplified and the location is great. I'll be dropping by a few times. It's about time Central Phoenix has a place like this. Try the Inari and Maguro Sashimi. The building is not that great but the ambiance is great, especially when you have other sushi lovers around you. The only bad thing I would say is, I wish they would appeal to higher end people and adults. When I went, there were way too many children but maybe because it was a Chinese Buffet before? I don't know. Give this place a try. The manager was really nice and I hope this place does well. It's definitely a first in this area.",

Its kinda eeky, I was excited because everyone I know is raving about this new sushi on the conveyor belt so of course I wanted to see what the fuss was about. We walked in and the Ora was just a little off. I walked in and you see all the different kinds of sushi just strolling away on this belt. We sat down near the belt and just looked at them pass us by. I was extremely hesitant, just like i am at a buffet. But i was hoping that once someone grabbed a plate the chefs would replace it with fresh sushi. NOPE that was not the case, all 3 chefs just sat there and talked among-st each other. I watched the sushi pass me by for maybe 10 mins before I got the courage to try something. I finally tried it and I was not blown away at all kinda grossed out started thinking \" i haven't seen the chefs switch out any sushi, so how do they know how long its been sitting there.\" so i decided to just get the check and leave maybe ill give it a try again, but i don't see it happening.",

It means that the sushi isn't always as fresh as it was just made, but it also allows you to pick out which you want based on looks.  Now I have to warn people as you can easily spend 20 bucks if you aren't careful just by picking up plate after plate.  The concept is interesting, but personally I would prefer my sushi to be made to order.  They do have an option for that, but the prices are higher",

There is a conveyer belt that runs through the whole restaurant and you basically take what you want to eat. It's awesome! The plates are color coded which indicates the price of each item. Everything is reasonably priced and you can easily get in and out of there spending a very reasonable amount. Another great thing about this place was that everything moves really quickly since you aren't waiting on a server or food to be made. I wouldn't recommend this place for \"sushi snobs\" because the food is good, not great. It is also an option to order something off the menu if you don't see what you want on the conveyer belt, or if you want the sushi to be made fresh. This is also a good place for someone who doesn't love sushi because they have some chicken options. My brother and I came here and he doesn't even like sushi and he loved it! All in all, I would come back for a good time but probably wouldn't choose this place if I was looking for amazing sushi.",

    "text": "Sushi station oh sushi station how you afford me to eat my favorite sushi on a budget.  Let me count the way I love thee... Ok so first off, this place has a unique concept, sushi is made and then sent out on a conveyer belt on different color plates which denote the prices. Typically about 4 pieces per plate. What's neat about this place, especially if you go with a group is that it allows you to sample quite a bit of sushi types by barely spending anything individually. I have been here at least a half dozen times at this point, and should technically have my picture on the wall I have checked in so many times on Belly.  The place is always clean and usually has a descent crowd, I don't really like sitting at the bar and prefer one of the booths off to the right side when you come in, you get first dibs if you sit over there on all the fresh stuff being put on the conveyer.  Service has always been good, If you get a chance ask to sit in Tom's section, this guy is on point, always makes sure your drinks are full and is pretty knowledgeable if you have questions. I always spend at least $50 here every time I go. It's hard not to, between two people. There is just to much good stuff to try.  This isn't your typical sushi bar...but if you like sushi and don't want to wait, this is the spot to go, sushi is ready as soon as you take  a seat...can't beat that. Everything you need is at your table, chop sticks, soy, all the server needs to bring is just drinks and wasabi.  I will be back, since it opened I am here at least 2 times a month.",

    "text": "Seriously, I was having one of those days when nothing seemed to be going right. Sushi is my comfort food, so I went to my favorite \"how you want it\" sushi place, which, much to the tune of the rest of my day, was closed for some unknown reason (possibly remodeling). Sushi Station is only a few blocks from my house and I've not tried it before. I had a particular roll in mind that wasn't on the menu, and I wanted it to-go, so I already had a chip on my shoulder when I walked in the door. And I was STARVING, which compounds my moodiness. The cashier didn't seem to really grasp what I wanted, so she got the manager/owner?, who came out and talked to me about what I wanted and was very easily able to accommodate me after clarifying what I wanted (which was basically a salmon Philly roll without the rice - but who eats sushi with no rice? That's not normal). The roll was RIDICULOUSLY cheap, far cheaper than any place I've ever gone to. I'm so glad I ordered two, because it was WAY exceeded my expectations, and I am now a happy man. I can't speak to the sit-down portion of the experience because I ordered to-go (and was out the door in under 5 minutes). But the place was pretty busy - barely a chair open in the place, and the conveyor belt was full of fresh sushi for the taking.  I remind myself of this constantly - one never knows what someone else's day has been like. I had had a terrible day - and this might seem cliche - but the staff at Sushi Station took just a little bit of time for me, and it turned my entire day around. Without a doubt, I WILL be back. Next time, I'm bringing friends. PLENTY of friends! I'd love to become a regular. And I'm hoping they cater! I feel it's a much-needed fare addition in this area, and you can't beat the price. Another reviewer said that other restaurants have tried and failed in this space - I've noticed that as well, but I'm pretty confident that won't happen to this place as long as they keep things just the way they are.  Really nice job, guys. Keep up the amazing work.",

    "text": "Decent sushi at fantastic prices! I've been driving to Desert Ridge's Sushi Station location for a few years - and am thrilled to have one so close to home now! They aren't reinventing the sushi wheel, by any means - but it's fresh, close, affordable and convenient. The restaurant is set up with a conveyor belt, and small plates starting at $1.75. With the affordable prices and small portions, it's easy to enjoy a range of rolls, nigiri and salads without breaking the bank. There's also a full menu, in case what you're craving doesn't appear on the conveyor - they will make it for you. I've found the service to be hit or miss - but that's just for drinks, refills, and the initial delivery of wasabi and mixing bowls. The food is constantly circulating - so the service there is unbeatable...you grab what you want when it comes by. So far, I've been averaging a meal each week since they opened this location - and at these prices, I can keep up that pace without destroying my food budget!",

This time I decided to walk in and sit down. I really like that you can order or grab off the conveyer belt. And wow! So many many choices of sushi off the belt. I felt like a kid in a candy store. Honestly, this place beat out the sushi in Oregon by far. So much more variety. The staff was friendly and attentive. I will defiantly attend more and it's only s block from home. Score!",

How it works is you grab a table and there is a sushi \"boat\" that constantly goes around all the tables and you choose what you want. There are different color plates that mean different prices and they have a big variety. They also have a regular menu with regular japanese restaurant items (at regular japanese restaurant prices). Our server, Ciara, was really attentive and kept making sure our drinks were full. You can eat well for under $10 here.",

It's quick and for the price of the sushi compared to quality you can't beat it. Definitly a dangerous spot to land at if you had a bit to drink, the sushi goes down quick and the wonderful assortment of colored plates start stacking pretty high. The servers really only bring you water/drinks and the check, so I try to tip the servers and chef's pretty equal, and the chefs are always super grateful for anything you throw in their tip jar.

It was more room temperature but the flavor was very good. The shrimp tempura wasn't the best I've had, but for the price it was ok. The one downfall that we observed was that the manager/owner hovered over our server, even telling him to make sure he wrote everything down. I don't know what her reasoning was, perhaps he was in training, but it came off as very unprofessional on her part. This conversation should have happened out of our earshot.",

I was able to get 3 sushi half roles and one dessert plate with some green tea all for $15 which I thought was pretty darn good for sushi! Everything tasted fresh and there were a lot of options. This is some of the better tasting sushi I have had in Arizona. The only roll I wasn't crazy about which is usually my favorite was the Philly Roll. The cream cheese just wasn't cold/hard enough.

It is a Saturday night at 7 PM why will you close down 50% or more of the tables?  Why turn away customers st dinner time on a sat night?  restaurant and have people sitting and waiting? I will never come here again on a Friday or Saturday night this is ridiculous.  Also you have opened the ice place next door which is completely empty and fully staffed but we are sitting here waiting at revolving sushi which is the only profitable business that you have.  This is not a good idea.  We had been waiting for 10 minutes when someone else has been turned on a Saturday night at 7:30 PM with half the restaurant closed.  (Why?) want to detail this because I think it's imperative that management and ownership know that this is a big problem that good patrons that have been coming here since you opened will stop coming because of this issue.  I've recommended hundreds if not over 1000 come here and I will literally start taking it back.  Empty table for the 20 minutes we have been waiting so far.  Also when you decided to close 50% of the tables you also killed your profits because the people that are sitting at the tables have not been eating for over 15 minutes while people are waiting and being turned away.  The hostess seems very happy and calm about this.  No issues saying buh bye! After 30 minutes I finally got the attention of the manager and let her know that people have been turned away and have been leaving the restaurant because they have a section close they are now opening the section it is now 30 minutes.",

The conveyer belt sushi was great and so was the service. The staff were very friendly and nice and they were quick to serve us and ask if we needed anything. This place is nice & quiet during the afternoon, and it was very clean. Definitely will be coming back for their delicious nicely priced sushi.",

It's in an old building that definitely needs renovation. We would go again, but not if we have a healthy appetite. It was way too easy to rack up a $40 lunch bill. That's pretty expensive for two people one of them being a small child.",

I LOVE shrimp tempura rolls and one of the things that I love about them is that the tempura is warm while the rest of the roll is cold. Not here. They use pre cooked cold tempura from what I can tell.  They had a sesame bean roll on the conveyor that I grabbed because I haven't had one of those since Chinatown in NYC. It was packaged which was weird but it was FROZEN solid.  Told the waitress so she brought another which was still frozen though not solid.  Ummmmm no thanks.

All the rolls have a sign in front of them saying what they are called and what's in it which is great for picky eaters (like myself).   The plates are color coded so you know how much each is. I loved that I could try a bunch of different types of sushi and didn't have to worry about spending a lot of money on something I didn't enjoy.  Overall the selection was pretty great and I've tried some sushi such as squid and red snapper that I've wanted to try but never have due to he price.  The only thing I disliked is the number of tables. I went about noon on a Saturday since I figured there would be enough people to make sure that there was always fresh sushi being put up.

It's a rotating sushi bar so that is also pretty cool it's the only rotating sushi bar I've ever been to! I've taken a couple people there and they've also thought it was a good time.

I refused for years, as I find the food to be gross and the atmosphere depressing. He raised the request to return the day before his 50th birthday. Being the great friend that I am, I agreed despite the vow I made to never return three years ago.   We walk in the door and I immediately felt sad. I wished I had eaten elsewhere beforehand. The hostess advised that the only open seating was in the far side corner of the restaurant. Fine. We walk to our table and my husband and I took the side nearest the wall. I glance down by chance, and to my absolute disgust I spot a giant dead roach. A wave of uncontrollable emotion overcame me and I said \"I'm not f-ing eating here!\" My husband and friend sat calmly at the table for what felt like hours as I protested my desire to leave. They finally agreed, but both of them claim only ten seconds went by before they arose from their seats.   I ranted the entire drive to CPK about how I was right all along. Sushi Station is nasty. After reading through their restaurant ratings from the Maricopa County board of health, I think not eating at Sushi Station is the best birthday gift I could have given to my friend. HBD RC",

    "text": "I'm not quite sure how conveyer belt sushi works in Phoenix, but I found the layout of this shop to be very different from what I normally experience in Portland. Back home, the conveyer belts revolve around the sushi chefs so that customers can easily grab the attention of one of the sushi chefs and tell them what they want to eat. This way, you don't have to try to flag down your waitress if you happen to see something on the menu that just isn't circulating around on the belt. To me that seemed extremely efficient. Here, if you want to eat at the belt, there are select seats in front of the chefs (and I didn't see anyone ordering directly from the chef, so maybe it isn't a Phoenix thing)? Why don't I just dine at a table instead of the conveyer belt, you ask? I like to see my food before I eat to stimulate my appetite...because sometimes you don't know what you want until you see it. After sitting there for 45 minutes, snacking and seeing the same dishes circulating we ordered salmon and eel from our waitress (who checked on us every 10 minutes or so). We didn't get our dishes until half an hour later when we had assumed they forgot our order and was about to ask for the check. Another interesting thing about this place is that you pay at your seat. I'm used to having the waitresses counting my plates while I'm seated, handing me the bill and then me paying at the register. Instead we had to flag our waitress down, wait for her to grab our card, and then wait again for her to bring the card back, which took another 20 minutes. They did seem pretty busy that night and I assume since there are not very many conveyer belt sushi places in Phoenix, this is just the way they run. Coming from a location where there are tons of conveyer belt sushi restaurants, I found my experience very different here. I recommend if you decide to eat here, just sit at the table and eat because you may be able to get all the dishes you want faster and check out faster.",

We walked in, sat ourselves and started grabbing plates off the conveyor. The prices were decent, ranging from 2.50-5.50. Nothing tasted fresh. The fried rolls tasted like they had been sitting out and were not hot at all. The gyoza was the one decent thing. The rolls were also the most miniature sushi rolls I have ever seen. Overall I will not be back here. This is much better sushi to be had in the valley.",

They tried to cut it so thin that it had a hole in the middle.... seriously? I left the restaurant semi-full and my bill came out to $39. Honestly, 90% of rolls are jam packed with rice and fake crab meat. Id rather go to a better sushi restaurant and pay 30-40+ for something high quality. I mean, id be full after eating 1 great roll priced at $13-16.. and maybe couple nigiris for $8-10.  Service, however, was wonderful i did leave 20% tip. I hope servers get paid higher hourly rate than most restaurants cause i can see food quality affecting their tip and its not their fault that the restaurant is cheap with ingredients.",

Parking is available behind the restaurant. Enter through alleys on either side of the restaurant. It is super convenient.   The restaurant is larger than it seems on the outside. Only one half of the restaurant was open to the public on this weekday night. We just missed Happy Hour by 5 minutes, but we still found prices pretty affordable, and the sushi is alright.  They offer several items at their lowest tier: California Roll, Snow Crab Roll, Tamago Nigiri, Red Snapper Nigiri (pretty fresh and cut well with minimal sinew).  One of the higher priced items that I enjoyed was their baked scallop over California roll.  Tip: If you like gyoza dumplings, order a fresh batch from the server when you first get in. It is worth the wait. $2.50 for 5 dumplings with sauce.  Maguro nigiri was a little pricier. Make sure that it looks fresh and of good color for optimal pieces. We also enjoyed a couple of pieces of seared albacore tuna.  We stuffed ourselves for $29.",

It's best to go on weekends like around 6-7pm because they belt is packed with fresh sushi. Sometimes, some of the sushi can look a little scary on the conveyor belt because it has been circling around for a while. You can definitely tell which plates have been on for a while and which plates are fresh.   I highly recommend you don't go to this restaurant on the weekend around 8ish. That's when they start slowing their service and don't place that many fresh plates out. Then you're eating sushi that has been on the belt for over 15 minutes, and it tastes pretty gross.",

We sit and chat and watch the sushi go round, grabbing our favorites and trying new rolls when something catches our eye. It's really fun to see different rolls so you can branch out and try something you might not have thought of without seeing it. My husband loves the mochi desserts, while I usually lean towards something chocolate :) My favorite sushi is the Yankee roll. Always a great evening!",

When you enter, you wait to be seated and then someone comes by to take drink orders. Once you are seated you can more or less begin choosing your plates. I've never been to a place like this- the food is on a long rotating belt and each plate costs a different amount. You have a guide in front of you which shows how much plates cost and they are sorted by color. There are a lot of options and not just sushi- jello, crab puffs, egg rolls, fruit, salad and more! You can spend a lot or a little. It's pretty sweet. The food was delicious. I will definitely be returning.",

It's a great place for cheap quality sushi.   What's best about it is it's color coded by plates. So you know how much your spending. The plates are delivered to your table by a conveyor belt that goes around the entire restaurant. The plates are labeled what they are and what's in the roll. Super helpful since my boyfriend is allergic to avocado. All around I recommend this place to all sushi lovers.",

    "text": "I read the reviews here before I picked this Kaiten Sushi place to go to and saw the high stars it got. I was so excited since I grew up eating kaiten sushi in Japan and Hawaii and then in Seattle too, and only recently learned that there is actually kaiten sushi in the desert! The reviews must come from people who never have been to kaiten sushi or aren't familiar with real sushi, or maybe I just went on an off-day --- though I did come here at 6:30pm on a Saturday so you'd think it'd be hopping and fresh. The conveyer belt was full and the first thing I saw was tako nigiri, which is one of my favorites so I was happy and grabbed it. It was okay - not that bad but nothing to rave about. Then not much else interesting came my way. There were lots and lots of rolls. I'm not a roll fan. I tried looking for and then ordering normal stuff you can find at most sushi bars but, since I am not a roll fan, I couldn't find much by way of nigiri or even gunkan or maki. I would say 85% of the belt was rolls. The only other non-rolls on the belt were ika, inari, tamago, fried gyoza, tai, maguro, salmon, bowls of different types of salads (seaweed, seafood, green, etc), packaged azuki buns, and some ramune drinks. All of the raw fish looked pretty dry. Lots of them passed by me over and over - and the belt is pretty long so I got to watch them get dryer and dryer. If you see something you want and it's on the other belt - and it's fresh, I'd say just go grab it or you'll have to wait forever! I relented from starvation and picked a seared maguro nigiri off the belt..and was so sad when I bit into it and had to chew on the maguro for a bit (True sushi fans will understand why this is sad). Weirdly, there were several sushi chefs behind the counter continously adding (rolls) to the belt. I can understand not wanting to put out nigiri or raw fish given the environment, but at least have a good menu to order from. I did order a hamachi & scallion hand roll, but wasn't impressed. I also tried to order a spicy tuna gunkan but was told they only do that in rolls. I do like that, from what I could see, they don't overdo the rice on the rolls. But the sushi rice wasn't flavored as it should be and was also on the colder side...which is weird, should be at least room temp. I ended up eating tamago, inari, seared maguro, tako, a piece of gyoza and the hamachi handroll. (Notice all of mine were cooked except the handroll.) My husband did like the salmon nigiri, he ate 2 plates of it.  Our waitress was nice but it did take quite long to get our wasabi and drinks (it wasn't THAT busy in there) - and she didn't seem to know the menu.  I know I'm in the desert...maybe I had my hopes up too high. I am going to try out other kaiten sushi places and hope I can be excited about kaiten sushi in the desert again. I'm not sure why it got such high praise here. I hope this is not what the bar is set on ..otherwise :-( .",

There's noticeably less variety here; most of the sushi rolls I saw come around were some kind of California roll with different sauces on top. The quality is also noticeably inferior. The pieces were sometimes falling apart, the few options with fish were not that fresh, and I got a little nauseous from the ubiquitous crab mix.   On the plus side I can at least say that the staff is friendly, but unfortunately they seemed to be a bit short staffed, especially when big parties started arriving with crying toddlers. (Here's a tip: if you're going out to dinner with a group of 10 people, you should probably choose something other than kaiten sushi - most of you won't be able to reach the conveyer belt, people in your party will inevitably start standing up and reaching over people, and the party of two next to you will judge you for your bad planning.) Next time I'll just drive the extra 20 minutes to north Scottsdale.",

The prices listed for the plate colors were the same listed next to each kind of sushi in the menu.

Maybe because I stuck towards the lower end of prices, but the ones I did try I was not impressed with. I did try some of the more \"expensive\" ones from my friends plate and still was not as impressed. Taste: 6/10  I would say that if you're new to sushi and have never had GOOD sushi, you'd enjoy this place. If you have, like me, however, experienced good sushi (I'm from the coast: good sushi is all I know;)) then you probably have better luck elsewhere here in Phoenix for some good sushi.

We usually go to Teharu in Scottsdale where the same rainbow roll is $2 and made fresh vs. Sushu station which costs $5 and very dry and small.  I hate leaving bad reviews but it was dimly lit, hard to read off the menu and seating was uncomfortable.  I paid for the few rolls we attempted but didn't finish and left.  I understand how reviews work, and im assuming someone is gonna attempt to \"reach out\" to me....please dont, everyone is different and has the right to express their experiences.",

You can rack up a big tab pretty fast, so don't let the low price per-plate trick you into building up a tower that crushes your weekend budget, but I love love LOVE the pay-as-you-go approach.  My favorites are the seaweed salad, the salmon nigiri and the Philadelphia roll, which is pretty much what I would get at any sushi place. They have a few vegetarian rolls, but I can't say I would recommend this for vegetarians, and definitely not vegans.   The staff here are also super friendly and a big part of why I keep coming back as well.  tl;dr This is a great place to go for happy hour + sushi or a fun dinner spot that won't break the bank. Vive la Sushi Station!",

Have been here several times and things were fine in the past, decent service and decent quality food for the price. Today however was a different experience, horrible service from our waitress. After we asked for the check we were told the she heard us already and after we wanted to address this with her afterwards she basically just said the same thing in a very rude manor and just walked off. We asked to talk to a manager and she basically just ignored us, another girl had to get the manager. Very bad customer service experience and disappointed..",

    "text": "So this is the first belt sushi place that I have been to here in AZ. I have been to several in the Seattle area, and I have had both amazing and crappy sushi from them. I am a little bit of a sushi fanatic so I kinda know my fish lol.   Price: 4.5 stars. The price is per plate like all belt places. They range from $1.75- $5.25. Most plates are $2.25- $4.25. I got 6 plates and spent about $15 before tax. But still this is the price for 2-4 pieces of fish and can add up really quick.   Service: 5 stars. I was greeted as I walked in and taken to a seat right away. The servers are great and if you ask a question they will make sure you are taken care of and make sure that someone is taking care of you.   Size of roll or fish: 5 stars. The rolls were a good size, and the cuts of fish were very large in comparison to most the belt sushi places I have been to.   Quality of fish: 4. stars. The fish is good, but I guess I am just spoiled with amazing fish so I can't quite give it 5 stars.   Red Snapper $1.75 for 2 pieces. Not amazing but not bad at all Tuna $3.25 for 2 pieces. It was a different texture than I'm used to but was good tasting Salmon $2.25 for 2 pieces. Delicious salmon no complaints at all Philly Roll $2.25 for 4 pieces. I enjoyed this basic roll.  Las Vegas Roll $2.25 for 3 pieces. This thing is amazing. Don't hesitate. Just get it.",

    "text": "Ok to be fair I am not a Sushi guy at all. I grew up in Ohio and I love my comfort food, should I raise the review a star just because I am not a fan of it. Meh, I guess not.  With that being said its growing on me, we came here to try and eat a bit more healthy. The bad in that is about all I can stand to eat are the fried items (again not a sushi guy but its growing on me) and the deserts. I guess its all ok.  Now that I have returned for a second visit I have a few thoughts. The rotation of food that is passing by is pretty amazing and looks pretty good! The bad on this is (with the fried items) that chances of you getting a freshly (at least warm) fried item is pretty slim even at lunch. Lucky for us we were sat at the first two booths that get the first pick of items as the cook places them out for grabs. After waiting for a few rounds the fresh selection is on my table and tastes pretty good!  The first time I was here I just went ahead and ordered a drink thinking it would be around the normal price and had a bit of sticker shock when the bill came. This place is by no means an expensive place but the drink prices make you think twice about that, yeah I'll have the water. You don't need any of those other drinks to enjoy this place.  The staff is great, I never had to worry about my free water getting topped off and that about all they are there for other then clearing your table afterwords. Speaking of there is a menu full of there good options but who wants to do that when one can just pick and choose as your food stolls by begging to be on your table.  The restaurant itself is clean but a bit dated, who cares you are not eating here for the wow factor in decor. I love the color coded plates but when they start to stack up you realize its time to back off a bit and get the check while skipping desert and by the way that would be a bad decision. I asked about their deserts and from what I am told (from the staff) is that a good portion of them came from the Cheesecake Factory! I really don't know if this it True or not but it tastes so good!   I will be back, would I skip going to my other favorite places (all near by) just to come here? sorry but that's a no, I leave this place feeling like something (taste?) is missing.",

    "text": "It's Friday and I wanted sushi!! I came here based on yelp and it is so close to me. I've never experienced a revolving sushi bar before so I was excited to head down here and try it out! Lots of parking so no problems there.When we walk in, the place is pretty big, they can use a decorator, and the service - let's just say they can improve on it.   We were seated next to the revolver - cool concept especially if you are a visual person. The prices were extremely reasonable so you don't have to worry about breaking the bank. We  tried four different rolls - don't ask me what because I just took the ones that look good. The flavors weren't bad - no problems there. We ordered two drinks - a wine and a beer. Guess what? They don't do happy hour prices on a Friday. Stupid, right? Anyway, we ordered the drinks anyway. Our server didn't even go over how this whole concept works, how the color of the plate determines the price and how they give you a check when you say you are done. We kind of just asked whichever employee who passed by these questions. It was quite irritating.  So while I am looking at this conveyor belt full of sushi, all these questions come to my mind: 1) How do they know how long a sushi plate has been on the conveyor belt? 2)How do they know if a plate is no good anymore since we are in room temperature 3) What do they do with all their inventory at the end of the night and how do they control spoilage?   All these questions going through my mind didn't stop me from eating. The pinot noir I had was a little too warm for me. We paid our bill - less than $30 for four plates, two alcoholic beverages = not bad. We were in and out of there in half an hour so this would be a great place to go for a quick lunch.  After the experience, I was ready to give this place three stars. However, half an hour later - I wasn't feeling all that well. I wouldn't necessarily say I had food poisoning, but I may have eaten a few things that my stomach didn't agree with.",

I had driven by the place several times and was a bit skeptical because I had the memory of the horrible buffet that resided there before it became a rotating sushi bar.   My friend and I arrived for dinner around 6 pm and service was great! There was no one waiting to be seated before us so we were greeted immediately, waited about three or four minutes to be seated, and had an awesome waitress who checked on us several times throughout out our entire stay. I wish I could remember her name because our cups where never dry and our table was aways cleaned; she was excellent! I don't know if we just got the one good server they have or service has gotten better since people wrote other reviews.   Sushi was delish! Everything was fresh and flavorful and plenty of options to make everyone happy. Sure there are better more extravagant sushi bars but this place is great enough to continue returning to unless I encounter the bad service other reviewers experienced.",

This place could easily be dropped in a Japanese city and would fit in.    I ended up getting the fried rice and tried a couple of plates of sushi.  Both were good, and the last time I was here the sushi was good as well.  The ebi (shrimp) is exactly like I used to have it in Japan.  I opted for the California roll this time around (easy way out) since I was doing some reading and didn't much feel like prepping each piece of sushi with wasabi and ginger.  The food was more than enough, plus a large drink put the total at $11.34.  Very, very friendly staff, easy location, easy parking, easy ordering and eating.",

One server asked me at the very beginning of my meal if I was okay, but only then. It was dead for a good while and suddenly alive with the dinner rush, both when the servers were sitting down (one girl picking her nails and avoiding my look) to where they were all standing up and walking around, I feel like I may as well have been sitting under an invisibility cloak.  I normally have no qualms about waiting, but that's not the point.  I /hate/ leaving bad reviews (effort and all), especiallyconsidering this is one of my favorite close-by sushi places.  Unfortunately, this has been on a steady decline for me over the course of a year.  This isn't my first incident with bad staff.  Wait staff don't seem to care about being there, the fish doesn't seem very fresh (I'm not a picky eater at all), and I've never liked how thickly cut the salmon and tuna are on top of the nigiri.  The sushi chefs seem to be pretty alright, though, but they also seem like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Honestly, I'm going to give it one more shot before calling it quits.",

Since I have been here alot I got some things I can reccomend.  (Most of this are cooked/fried) 1. California tempura- a must if you come here. 2. Vegas roll-better than most vegas roll in the area. 3. Santa fe- very mushy and explosion of flavors in your mouth. 4. Playboy roll. Just grab it and try it. You'll thank me later. 5. New Mexico roll.  6. Jalapeno poppers. Probably the most crunchy poppers here in the area.  I'll keep coming here. I also tried some other rolls such as , baked scallop, baked mussels, squid salad, California roll- but find that there are better places that represents those.",

That's not a great bite/dollar ratio. Why is it a dollar per bite? Because conveyor belt sushi is a sales gimmick.  It's the same reason that buying Lucky jeans at Nordstrom costs more than buying Lucky jeans at Costco. At Costco I pick up a pair knowing it's probably good and will likely fit and if I really don't like them I know I can send them back. At Nordstrom shopping is an experience. Jeans are presented on manikins with six-pack abs so I know exactly how they'll look on me. I can really experience them before purchase. Do some Jackie Chan spinning front kicks to see if they're comfortable. Frog hop around the dressing room. Pose like a GQ model with my leg up on the stool running one hand through my hair. And like conveyor belt sushi, at Nordstrom you know the price up front, but you really don't pay attention to it until you get to the register, and, realize, \"holy shit, I'm just paid $10/flying front kick in the dressing room.\"  So is it worth it? I don't know. Would you go do yoga in a beautiful, well-appointed studio floored with bamboo and taught by a bona fide ancient guru if after every session the guru kicked you as hard as he could in the shins? If so, you'll probably love Sushi Station.  Great for: self-disciplined eaters Bad for: American eaters",

    "text": "I frequent this restaurant because $2.00 for 4pcs of spicy crab roll is a killer deal. I also love the Hawaii roll. The prices are good, there is pretty much unlimited ginger which is good, and the only draw back is that the service is mediocre at best. We also wonder how long it will take before we get sick from eating sushi on a revolving conveyor belt. We have been 9 times and so far so good. I will update Yelp if that ever changes.",
