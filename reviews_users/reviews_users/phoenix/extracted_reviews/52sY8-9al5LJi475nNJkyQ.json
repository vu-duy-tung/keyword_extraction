Why do places like this always push the 6-7 dollar meal? How about a box (no meal) with ten chicken fingers, instead of 25 or 50?? I'd pay nine-ten bucks for that.  The fries are crinkle cut variety. They really don't belong at a 2011 chain like this one - but in a value bag at Family Dollar. The chicken is good but nothing crazy. It's better than most chains, but I prefer Popeye's. This place is alright but the fast food market in Phoenix is now saturated with these boring, bland chains. Dean's review is spot-on.",

The food was fair, I was hoping for more of a Chik-fil-a style nugget or stripe, but instead got large strips that were pretty heavy with greasy fried coating.  The price was also high for a fast food value meal.   I would drive the extra few miles to hit up a Chik-fil-a vs. going to the Cane's that is closer to my house, but its worth a try just to check out this new chain the valley of the sun.",

Their fries could use a little seasoning but the juicy chicken tenders and their special sauce are AWESOME!!  Special sauce is creamy, looks similar to thousand island but with a little kick to it.

That visit the chicken was juicy, the batter was damn near tempura style, the crinkle cut fries were that perfect balance of crunchy yet soft on the inside, the dipping sauce was a wonderful taste of garlic and pepper and creamy deliciousness and the toast was perfectly toasty and buttery. We were blown away and I have told countless friends that they were the best fast food joint out there. Fast forward to present day and my favorite fast food joint served a dud. The chicken was overcooked, the batter was too crunchy and overdone and my fries were limp. But you say, \"Josh I can see the container, you took it to go, surely that caused some of the problems?\". I say no. The restaurant was a block from my hotel and was only in the container for a short time and could not have caused said damage. If it did shame on Cane's for offering drive thru. Cane's, we will always have Vegas.",

This may very well be what they are going for but it always assaults my sense of smell and throws me off a bit.  Other than that, great place to grab chicken, its a fast food place so there isn't anything fancy about it but they do what they do very well.  The \"Caniac Combo\" is a great meal to split with two people: 6 chicken tenders, pile of fries, coleslaw, and texas toast with a beverage.  We usually swap the coleslaw out for extra fries and add a piece of toast on to it for a meal for two under $10.  The dipping sauce is a great blend of spices and sauce.  Didn't realize they were open as late as they are but good to know for the late night cravings.",

    "text": "Please build more locations- and come to the East Valley! The Peoria location is somewhat close to my office, so Iv'e been to Cane's a couple times. Much like the new fad of restaurants focusing on ONE menu item (a la In 'N Out, Five Guys, Chipotle, etc.) Raising Cane's is all about the chicken finger. And they do it well. Perfectly battered, lightly fried (not too greasy) and served with awesome crinkle skinny fries, toasted Texas garlic bread, and cole slaw it's a great meal.   Leave your diet at home though, this place is creeping with calories. Brave customers can order the \"Caniac\" meal which includes 6 fingers, 2 toast, cole slaw, fries and a large fountain drink. They serve Coke products and also make a fresh squeezed lemonade, which is worth trying (switch to soda if you're not impressed but pay an extra $0.35 to upgrade to the lemonade). Staff is friendly at this location- you order up front, find a table and they bring the food out to you after calling your name.   Make sure to ask for hot sauce if that's your thing. The meals come standard with \"Cane's Sauce\" - which is sort of hard to describe. It's sort of ranch, black pepper, and mayo mixed together? It's really tasty- seems like most people go nuts over it, dipping everything in it (fries, bread, chicken).   Cane's is a franchise chain, so hopefully they'll expand in AZ. The restaurant is named after a pet dog, which is cool for dog lovers- that's the theme- dogs. Decor is kitschy but it works.",

    "text": "KFC move aside!  If you're looking for some really tasty non-greasy fried chicken, then look no further as this is the place to come.  Be warned though they only serve chicken fingers! The place can be a little crowded as it was on the weekend we visited so you may have to wait for a seat to open up if you're looking to dine in.  Alternatively you can choose the drive through but that line was long.   The restaurant was clean, well lit, and spacious though there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables/chairs. Service was fast and the menu was very simple which I'm in favor of!   Ordered the 3-piece basket and a lemonade.  The lemonade wasn't too sweet but cool, refreshing and tasted as if it was fresh squeezed. The fries was plentiful and was shared.  The basket comes with a slice of buttered toast similar to Texas Toast which was soft, chewy and practically melted in your mouth. The chicken tenders was well seasoned, crispy, not greasy, tasty, juicy but what really stands out is that it was light.  It's filling but you don't feel that overstuffed after eating them.  I really like the simplified menu, the lemonade drinks, and the chicken tenders which is definitely a draw for me to be back here!",

If you want healthy, you started off in the wrong place. Fast food is never healthy, not even when you're ordering a salad. Enough of my rant on common sense from the masses.   This place does a very few things and they do them all well. I have been here several times. The chicken, fries, toast and cole slaw are always good. Is it going to send you screaming out to tell all your friends? Probably not. But it's good and their menu is easy to order from. It's also better chicken than you will find at probably 90% of the normal fast food drive-throughs.   It's definitely a place I like hitting up when I can and I will continue to do so. I have yet to have anything there that was a turn off.",

    "text": "If a fast-food restaurant only serves chicken fingers, I would have thought that it would serve the greatest fast-food chicken fingers I have ever consumed.  I thought wrong.  Very wrong.  The food that I ate left me pondering the mystery of how Raising Cane's has such a hardcore fan base.  I tried the 3 finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, a slice of texas toast and a drink.    I'll start with the good. The texas toast. It's a massive piece of fluffy white bread covered in butter.  The bread is so soft that it could be used comfortably as a pillow.  But, I wouldn't recommend that because you could choke to death by accidentally eating said delicious texas toast pillow in your sleep.  The bad. Everything else in the box. I appreciate that the chicken wasn't greasy, but it certainly wasn't crispy.  The actual meat was dry and the breading was severely under seasoned.  And whatever that Cane's sauce is supposed be, it's disgusting.  It's some sort of a barbecue sauce and ranch dressing mixture that tastes like an unidentifiable somewhat smokey, somewhat spicy, creamy mix of blandness.  It really doesn't say much when the specialty (and only) sauce a restaurant serves makes its underwhelming main dish taste even worse.  Or maybe that says a lot.  The fries were just standard.  Considering chicken fingers are all that's on the menu, I don't see any reason why I would return to this or any other Raising Cane's.  If for some bizarre reason I end up eating at a Raising Cane's again, I'll just order 10 slices of texas toast and call it a day.",

The only thing that gets a good rating is the sauce. You only get one thing of it, and if you want more it's extra, the chicken batter is tasteless  and you need to dose it in suave for it to be good, also the fries having no seasoning or flavor on them. If you want real fast food fried chicken go to chic fil a, or Zaxbys(which isn't in Arizona yet, but I hope it is soon) this are 100 times better and this goes for all raising canes stores. I would only go here for the sauce and the Texas Toast, literally that's it",

They also support education and hunger programs and a variety of other community initiatives.

I mean, this place isn't bad, I just left kind of feeling meh.  Here's why.  For starters, I will say I love the service I got here.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, upbeat and really nice.  That's the one thing I liked about this place. Other points, not so much.    The menu here is really limited.  You basically have 4 menu options to choose from. That's it.  No side items, build your own meal, nothing. I'm a girl that likes options, and sometimes I don't want a gigantic meal, just parts of it.  So I went with the smallest order I cound find, which was the 3 chicken strips, fries, drink and Texas toast for $5.99.  When the food came out and it wasn't half bad.  I felt like the toast could have been cooked a little longer, even though it was really yummy.  Fries could have been a little crispier, and the chicken wings were pretty good.  Overall, the food was good, and not bad, I just wasn't moved or overly impressed with it as a whole.  Plus, I don't think you can get different dipping sauces, even though their \"secret sauce\" was quite tasty. What I mean, was I didn't see an option for ranch or bbq sauce on the menu.  I wish they had more menu options here. I know you can only cook chicken so many ways, but it would be nice to see a salad, or a la carte type ordering, which they didn't have.  Service was great, and overall not a half bad experience.",

I am in heaven, until I arrived at Canes, was completely taken back by the menu, or should I say lack of.  You get chicken tenders , toast and fries, THAT'S IT! OH, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TENDERS ON A BUN. That's it......really? Expensive too, wow, I will be back again.....NOT!  Popeye's certainly isn't  inexpensive, but 10 times the menu, and lots of special menu items during the year ..... I will be heading north for my southern fast food fix...",

I'm a transplant from the Southeast and had really been missing the chicken finger joints like Zaxby's and Guthrie's in Florida and Georgia with their perfectly cooked chicken fingers, special sauce, crinkle fries, and texas toast.  Raising Cane's serves it up just like those joints.  Fresh, hot, and delicious.  If you don't like chicken fingers, this place is not for you.  It's all they do.  Their tiny menu consists of box combos with either 3, 4, or 6 fingers, or a 3-finger sandwich, along with fries, texas toast, and Cane's sauce.  You get coleslaw with the 4 and 6 finger boxes. They have no other dipping sauces, just Cane's sauce, a peppery mayo-based sauce.  Oh so delicious!  And they have great sweet iced tea!  Always a plus in my book.  4 stars!",

We were all really happy when we learned that Cane's Plaza and restaurant was opening.   The selection is limited but the chicken strips are tasty.  The boxes come with cole slaw (or not - depending on the size) and fries.  The toast is awesome and so is the seweet tea.",

I was underwhelmed:  The strips themselves seem to be of higher quality than other places but the overall flavor just isn't there.  The fries, cole slaw, and toast are all pretty ok and nothing special.  Standard stuff.  The dipping sauce that some people rave about is also just ok.  It tastes almost like thick Italian dressing and marinara sauce mixed with a hint of ranch.  It is ok at best and is just weird with chicken strips.  The price is a bit high.  I got one of the meal deal things and it was almost 10 bucks.  Not horrible but not a stellar value either.  On the other hand, the drive through line was pretty fast during the lunch rush and the workers were friendly.  Anyway, the next time I feel like eating a junk-food-heart-attack for lunch I'm going down the street to Churchs.  Just give me some overly fried strips of cheap chicken with some ranch and I'm happy.",

The combination of fries and lightly toasted bread paired with the canes sauce is heaven in your mouth. Now the drink-- I am in love with their sweet tea, but if you don't like your tea super sweet, then I don't recommend it. And just as the icing on the cake, the service is friendly and even came around to ask how we were doing. Not too shabby for a \"fast food\" joint. Highly recommend!",

If anyone has ever been to Lucky Wishbone in Tucson, it very much reminds me of their chicken fingers meal. It is excellent and their homemade lemon aid is to die for. We always have to order extra because we fight over it.   Slightly pricy for a fast food place, but you do get the quality you pay for and they have a club called the Caniac Club you can sign up for and get free meals.  Whats not to love?

All in all not worth the effort.  Too expensive for too little. Go to Shanes Shack instead.",

Raising Canes needs at least mash potatoes and gravy! Wtf? Also that billboard they have off the I-17 Peoria exit needs to change.... I know the dog is what inspired the name of the place ok I get it but what are you advertising? It looks like dog food. Lol. I seriously thought it was dog food til I stopped by QT next to it and realized it was a fast food joint. Overall nothing special here... Go to Popeyes.",

Raising Cane is a paradise for any chicken fingers lover.  There are movie posters all around inside the restaurant and even in the bathroom area.  A disco ball above is rotating and reflecting light beams down while you place your order.  They have plenty of spaces for parking.  The chicken fingers were really crispy, but nothing too special.   I do like the Texas Toast.  As Norm mentioned, I wish it was more garlicky as well.  The coleslaw was far too wet for me.  I think the Cane's sauce was similar to one of Arby's sauce. I so wanted to give them more stars, however there are so many places that have better chicken strips for that price.",

Unfortunately if I am comparing this location to the other locations than 2 stars is a stretch.   The sauce was good but for some reason seemed to taste different than the sauces at other locations.  The chicken was awful. I bought the Caniac, which is 6 pieces, and 4 of the 6 pieces were stale and hard to chew. I was there around 11am so there is no excuse for stale food.  The bread was also stale and very bland.  However, the sweet tea was great. Since it is so hard to get quality sweet tea here in Arizona I was pleased to find it was as good as Louisiana sweet tea. I thought it was a 5, which made the experience a 2 for me.",

I ordered their 4 chicken finger meal, which I guess is very popular.  It came with a side of fries, a piece of garlic bread and some slaw.  My favorite coleslaw is still the one from KFC.  The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok.  The sauce they gave you to dip it in helped.  So it was good.  Would I go back? Sure, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

The meal comes with krinkle-cut fries and a slice of Texas Toast which is crisp on one side and fluffy on the inside. Their signature sauce is creamy with a hint of smoke and tang. It tastes great with anything dipped into it. Also, I made sure to refill my sweet tea because it is so good!  Definitely a great place for chicken tenders and fries, it's simple and done well!",

    "text": "I took my photo after checking in and said I'd write the review after I finished eating... Well that was four hours ago. The food was so good I completely forgot I never even wrote a review. Firstly let me start by saying my wife and I just recently moved here from Florida and were super bummed to find out Zaxby's aren't in the west. However, now our attitudes about that are... WHO CARES?! I mean my goodness the chicken here put Zaxby's to sleep.  Perfectly breaded chicken tenders. Not too much to where it feels dry and not too little to where it feels almost like a lazy effort, but the happy median making the tenders amazingly crunchy to the bite. That crunch is followed by the juiciest tenders I've had in a very* long time. The fries are very good as well. My whole basket was well made. No surprise raw bites in there, no hidden burnt fries, all delicious. The bread?! I'm not sure what's going on with the bread. When you first bite into this \"Texas toast\" it just tastes like normal bread but after you swallow your first bite some hidden deliciousness just creeps up on you! I am so glad we found this place and we will gladly become regulars here.",

My son went for a ride on one of the bikes and the workers saw this and ask us who owned the red truck,  that someone may have stolen a bike. They were watching out for their customers. How very nice.   The next time I went to raising cane I went through the drive through and the attendant ask me if I was having a good day, I told him I was not having a good day and he bought and paid for my dinner ! What? Who does that? I could not hold back the tears at this kind act. Thank you Gabrial!!! You have no idea how that affected my life. You see my son (the same one on the bike & about your age) had just been incarcerated unjustified and I was feeling very sad and alone and betrayed by the court system. You are an angel.

    "text": "Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \"The Box Combo\" which included 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods, I pulled over, parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............  Chicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes, my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \"off\".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped, but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!  Fries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.  Cole Slaw- Didn't try it.  Texas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice, I would have done it.  Soda- Coke Zero tasted a little \"off\".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.  Sauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.  Service in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh, right?  We shall see................",

Saw some lower ratings for this one, but I've been to like six different ones and they've all been good.  However, this one was not up to par.  Staff was fine, but the fingers were not juicy and crisp but felt like they were over cooked and dry (maybe the fryer temp is too high?).  Same for the fries which were too well done (and typically I would rather have slightly overcooked than undercooked fries).  Then the toast was a bit too mushy and didn't have that crispy buttered side while staying firm but spongy on the non-toasted side.  At least the sauce was still the same :)   Since I'm not in this part of PHX often, I'll hope the one I hit up tomorrow is better or just go to Raising Cane's in Vegas...",

Walked in and loved the charm of this place, big posters of Elvis, Beatles, movie posters like Hangover 2, dispecible me... Catchy music blaring and a disco ball hanging over the register area. My kids loved it already, but once we got over all of that and read the small menu I was shocked. I looove chicken fingers, but I just can't believe that's all they had along with fries and cole slaw..that's it ? Really??... we went ahead and ordered, the food was very good,but we really wanted other things than just fries. They need more sides, more choices in dipping sauce. The kids wanted ranch, not the peppery ,tangy sweet sauce they offered. Hubby wanted mashed potatos n' gravy and wasn't crazy about the runny cole slaw, I would have loved some buffalo wing sauce..but all they had was fries, toast, cole slaw and their special sauce. Like I said food was good, atmosphere charming, but no choices in menu. Everyone gets the same thing basiclly. I will be back though, food was good, simple and I know kids will eat it!",

The chicken tenders always comes out fresh; I always forget how fresh they are that they burn my mouth when I take a bite lol. The toast is flawless as well. I choose to eat the Texas toast last!  The inside is always clean! They always have ice in the ice machines and you can not beat their sweet tea! It's delicious, the bathroom is always kept clean as well.   I really dig the setup inside! I'm a huge movie fan and I just love how they have classic movie posters through out the restaurant! My favorite part about canes is how it's named after the owners dog Cane!   Overall I rate Raising Canes a 5 star! Staff is friendly and polite. The food is always fresh.

I have to say I was impressed with the layout and how fast they move their product. The chicken was really good with most of the flavor from the sauce. The fries are basic at best and the sauce helps keep them at par. For a fast food joint I would say their fried chicken is really good and wouldn't mind having more, but I would leave the fries out. I had their Cole slaw and Texas toast and that was pretty good. Unfortunately they do not have one close in my neighborhood so it will be awhile before I visit another cane's chicken.",

    "text": "Wow. It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there, like shit service, huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding. In this case, I'll make a unique exception because I encountered none of those. Confused? Read on.  The wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid. It's. Just. Chicken. Strips. HOW can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that? It's bland and literally the most boring meal I've ever had. Just one (SMALL) step up from a glass of water in flavor. Let's break it down: tasteless chicken with breading that makes even Church's, arguably the blandest food in the state, taste passable; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like Del Taco's but half as thick (why?!); boring coleslaw; boring sauce. Probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast, but hell if I can't make that myself at home, right? It's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place. Go ANYwhere else. Mexican, burger, whatever. I'd rather eat airline food, seriously. I felt like I needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal. And chicken strips are ALL they had on the menu, with the sides as mentioned above! I was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my Caniac with half the meal to go, it was THAT un-special. Chick Fil-A is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place. At least ~they~ have some sort of flavour. Making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark (== flavour) meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star. Making three, in case you aren't counting. I appreciated the high-rating reviews I read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants I will NEVER eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future. But take your kids here. They'll love it. It's why I gave it one more star than I was planning to.  About a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night. Won't ever happen again. Wife, it wasn't your fault, it was mine. And Yelp's. (presses period key on keyboard at the end of that sentence so hard that the plastic splits)",

Actually thought that the streamlined menu was good. I figured since the menu was simple that everything would be very good. I ordered two \"Box\" combos. The chicken tenders were tender but had no flavor. How can your signature item be bland. The Texas toast also had no butter or garlic flavor and was barely toasted. The fries were just basic small crinkle cut fries but did not hold any salt on them. The cole slaw was ok but not great. The best part of the meal was the sauce but I really wasn't expecting to have to drown the chicken tenders in sauce to give them flavor.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed.",

I usually don't like cafeteria-style fat soggy crinkle fries, but these were thin and crisp - so yum! The \"Texas toast\" kinda looked (and tasted) like a hot dog bun.

Fresh squeezed, sweet REAL lemonade. Their fries are great and their Texas toast and canes sauce is to die for. The chicken here, in my opinion, is nothing special but it is good. If you are a lover of Chic Fil A's chicken, you will probably agree. I did order a chicken sandwich one time and while the bread was delicious and I like that they put canes sauce on it, it comes with just lettuce and the chicken inside is simply a couple of chicken fingers. I would have much more enjoyed a full piece of chicken on my sandwich instead of struggling to hold it together, and a tomato or two would have been nice, but like I said, it's good.

I stood in line for over 5 minutes despite the fact that they had 2 registers open and only 3 people in line ahead of me.  Then, I waited 14 minutes to receive my run of the mill chicken fingers with below average crinkle fries.  The toast was standard buttered texas style and the coleslaw was a little too runny for my liking.  The only thing worthwhile in this place was their dipping sauce which isn't enough to make the bland tasting chicken worth a good review.  While eating our lunch, a worker was cleaning tables and sprayed the table next to ours with a windex like substance which ended up misting my daughter and I.  Nothing like the taste of windex with lunch, nice touch guys.  I had pretty high expectations of this place given all of the \"hype\" it has received but I will not go back and won't recommend to any of my friends or family.

I'd say it was pretty legit for fast food... and I don't really like fast food ever (unless it's In-N-Out)! The crinkle fries were crunchy and the toast was buttery. That chicken though! With the Cane sauce, which is a mysterious creamy mixture of something herbal and smoky (not quite Thousand Island dressing), was a perfect combo with the chicken. Chicken breading maybe could use more seasoning, but there was this very obvious crunch and the inside was so juicy. We also had a lemonade since the combo comes with a drink (we don't drink soda), and that thing was super sweet, but enjoyable for an afternoon that was already threatening to get hotter. Large location with chill vibes, plenty of parking.   It might have been odd to get Raising Cane's, but not for us since the first time we heard about it were from some podcast dudes who reside in Phoenix; they always hyped the crap out of it, so here we were! Now I have to see if the quality checks out at the San Diego location!",

So last night, even though the line was around the block, I was hungry enough to wait, so I waited.  I got a \"Box Combo\", which was four chicken strips, crinkle cut fries, slaw, Texas Toast, and their own sauce.   The food was hot and delicious.  And unlike McDonald's, I didn't have to wait in two lines for the guys in front of me while MY FOOD gets cold. Spoke briefly with a very nice manager, re: speed of the line, she was great!    The chicken was hot.  Very hot.  Delicious.  1/4 strips was not as tender as I'd like, but do the math: that means 3/4 WERE tender.  And they were tender...and hot.  They were tender and HOT!  Fries actually could have been hotter; there were not as hot as the chicken (in their own way.)  The price of this Box Combo was, with tax, $8.00.  $8 bucks, on the head.  Attention Subway, McDonald's, et. al.: this is a better value.  Quite frankly, a MUCH better value.  Tell you the truth, if you took away the fries, @$8.00, is STILL a better value than MickeyD's or Subway.   Now, the lemonade.  The lemonade is so weak that to make it a \"signature item\" is just silly.  It's not that good.  It's actually not good at all, actually.  It barely tastes like lemonade.  Frozen concentrate lemonade from a grocery store tastes better and I'm not being sarcastic.  I've now had the lemonade from Cane's twice, at two different locations, so it's not the day, it's not batch, it's a mediocre recipe.  Wait.  That's too kind.  It's completely disappointing.  Here's the biggest test of all: would I go back?  Yes. I would go back to Canes anytime.  Good value, great product.  $8 bucks for what I got was a good value!",

    "text": "First off, i think there are only two things i think cane's should better, One is to clarify itself better. It seems alot of people are confused/disappointed that the menu is small. Think of cane's as less of a restaurant and more of a chicken finger stand.  Second thing is my one complaint, the fries can easily become soggy. I always get it to go and they put it in a styrofoam container. Then they put it in a plastic bag. They are on the soft side of fries to start with, but that combination traps all of the moisture and just makes them some of the worst fries. I always take the box out of the bag and pop the lid. Not really a solution if you're driving too far as they'll be cold quick, but works for me.   The other comment i saw that i have to comment on, is that you can get chicken fingers anywhere. Good luck with that, because i have tried. Getting older and \"trying\" to eat healthier, i kicked red meat down to two days a week, but i'm a man, therefore i must have meat.... or else. So, I have gotten chicken tenders from just about every fast food joint in town and only a few places stand up to theirs.  Also, the cane's sauce is good, but i eat mine with Stubbs Sweet Heat BBQ sauce and some Sriracha.",

    "text": "Some of my black friends recommended this place to me (True story, my black friends love chicken), so it's been on my list of \"places to check out\" for a few months.  Did the drive through thing, got the chicken strip sandwich / fries / lemonade combo.  The chicken strips were moist and crispy, quite tasty.  The Cane sauce had good flavor, but since they wanted to charge me an additional 35 cents for sauce, the sandwich was kind of dry (just chicken, sauce, lettuce & bun).  The fries were crinkle cut, and soggy.  The \"fresh squeezed\" lemonade tasted like Country Time and the service was less than personable or stellar.  So, if you are JUST going to get some tasty chicken, this place is nice and at least they don't hate gay people.  Outside of that, nothing you need to check out.",

The staff there was sooooo friendly! They even gave our dog a little doggy biscuit, how cool is that!   The meal itself was tasty. The breading is like a light crackery crisp yumminess going on. The sauce is great but wish there were other options. The coleslaw was tasty. Hubs went nuts over the bread but I wish it was toasted on both sides. The fries are nothing special, but ok.   We really liked this place a lot and will for sure be back!",

I don't know if management has changed or who orders the food but we were disappointed in early February by the skimpy chicken, the limp fries and loss of flavor in the coleslaw.  Could have been a bad day, right?  So we went back a couple of weeks ago.  Same thing.  The size of the chicken fingers has drastically been reduced and even the bread is lacking.  It was \"shrunken\" and limp.  I really hope Raising Cane's will come back to the food we were raving about six months ago.",

Fresh squeezed lemonade is good, though I like it a little tangier. The sauce is good, a little peppery.  I agree with other reviewers that more variety would be good, like a salad or some kind of vegetable.  I will definitely be back, because the chicken tenders are really good.",

The sweet tea is to die for, and the slaw and Texas toast is as good as the rest if not a hair better.  I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful too.  The only reason why I went four and not five stars is grease.  My strips, although delicious, were just a bit greasier than I would have liked.

    "text": "1 star - Only because there was no option to rate this place (and their food), a zero!  I seriously recommend buying a bag of your [un]favorite bag of store bought, oven-baked chicken strips vs eating at Canes.  When a restaurant is known for selling chicken strips, and ONLY chicken strips, you'd expect them to be the best thing since sliced bread...when seriously, a slice of bread is the better alternative to eating at this dining establishment...If you feel comfortable calling it that..?  The staff looked like a bunch of punks, allowed to wear their pants below their butts whilst donning a Cane's shirt for their \"uniform\".  \"Service with a smile\" was lost to the owner/manager in the training manual, and try as I did, I couldn't find a single one of the butt-peaking male employees walking around \"looking busy\" to wipe down the table we sat at, even though I asked for someone to do so.  It was just disgusting once we left the order counter where I found myself frustrated by the lack of turning my chicken strips in to anything other than that. Have they not heard of wraps? Or even a chicken strip SALAD?  Seriously the worst food ever..  Oh, and if you need to use the restroom on your way out the door, be prepared to bring your own paper, because keeping restrooms stocked was lost in the training manual as well!!  Bad, BAD experience my friends...Keep your distance, and consider yourselves warned!",

Then when I told the cashier that I had been charge for the wrong amount, she told me she would change in the system and then they would comp for the mistake. When I got to the window to receive my food the person said you have this combo and I told her no I have another combo but the lady said they would call me the difference. She said let me have your receipt I told her I didn't pay for them were expensive combo but the lady said she would copy it. Then she said that was impossible because she was the manager and that cashiers can't make that decision. We went back-and-forth until I gave her my card to pay the difference. And then when I receive my food it wasn't even the correct couple still. She looked at me rolled her eyes and gave me another two chicken strips to complete my order in a box.",

The chicken is juicy, lightly breaded, and delicious. The fries are pretty good, the special sauce is pretty good, but the sweet tea is amazing! We are defiantly stopping by here again before we head home. The staff was also absolutely fantastic. They were super nice and helpful. Very pleased with our visit here. We both cleaned our plates :)",

Unfortunately, Raising Cane was not the answer.  There is not a single \"healthy\" way to order -- seriously, you can't put something GREEN on the menu? Say, a few strips on a bed of lettuce, as an option?   It's chicken strips, fries, bread and slaw (optional). Period. The only question is a matter of specific quantities. The chicken was good, but not \"as\" good and there is ONE type of sauce for dipping, and I do not care for it.    So, I tried but it looks like I'll still be battling my conscience next time I'm craving a chicken sandwich.",

    "text": "I had my first experience with Raising Cane's today.  I got the Three Finger Meal and, for fast food, it was pretty good.  The breeding on the chicken was not overdone and, although not very seasoned, tasted pretty good.  They serve crinkle cut fries here, which I'm not usually a fan of but were actually decent.  The meal also came with Texas toast which basically was like a grilled half of a hot dog bun.  It was ok, if a bit of a gimmick.  The meal stood fine on its own without the extra carbs of the bread.  Lastly, the fresh squeezed lemonade was good.  Not overly sweet.    I guess the thing I liked best was the atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  The location I ate at is pretty new so they may still be in the honeymoon stage, but I'd definitely return should I get a craving for chicken fingers again.",

The chicken fingers are good - light and crunchy, seasoned just right. Crinkle-cut fries were OK, although I wish the Texas toast were a little more garlicky. I'm glad to have this cool addition to the businesses in my neighborhood.",

    "text": "What could a name like Raising Cane's possibly be? Well, it proved to be genius when the owner decided to use his dog's name to sell hot, fresh chicken fingers! Its all I think about now.    Having only consumed twice, I can happily say, I am addicted!  The only places I can remotely compare them to here locally are Popeye's, Church's, and KFC.  But honestly, I feel like they are in a separate league.  What they offer is uber simple, yet crazy addicting.  Chicken Fingers + Crinkle Fries + Coleslaw + Buttery Toast, wait a second? Buttery Toast? That's right.  And then they pack their \"secret\" sauce that you must dip into! Its the chicken finger's sidekick!  I mean, can Batman really save Gotham without Robin? Come'on! ;-p  The beauty of their chicken fingers is how the batter is light and thin, yet full of flavor!  I could barely detect any kind of grease!  The chicken meat is perfectly tender! And their \"secret\" sauce is like a peppery thousand island with other unknown variables!  I personally come for the sauce!  Their crinkle fries are some of the best I've ever had, crispy and simply delicious! The coleslaw is average at best but I like how the cabbage is diced into perfect little squares! The sesame toast is lightly buttered and can be enjoyed by itself! Who doesn't like that?!  The two times I have dropped by, I always got the Combo Box Meal.  Comes with 4 pieces of chicken, fries, coleslaw, toast, and a soft drink (crushed ice) for $7 and something cents.  Apparently, it's their most popular.  Quit thinking about it, go get some! Look for the logo of a dog with shades on.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/52sY8-9al5LJi475nNJkyQ?select=VFGVABajhQN8F2M4suGwdA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/52sY...</a>",

This review is for those who think fries and a tasty slice of Texas toast is too much to handle with your tenders.  Every time i get gas at QT i hit the drive thru and order just 3 tenders and 1 Cane's sauce, and it satisfies.  Update: got soggy strips last time, they said my next meal was on them, they replaced the strips but charged me for the sauces because they said I didn't claim there was anything wrong with them previously, past couple times I came, I was nickel and dimed for an ice water in the drive thru.
