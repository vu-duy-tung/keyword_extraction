The happy hour menu is diverse and cheap; I can't wait to go back and try the arancini and poutine (fries with gravy) for $5!",

The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)",

It was happy hour so I had a glass of Cabernet and we ordered the hummus plate off the HH menu.  It was really good.  A nice combo of veggies, pita, hummus, and tzatziki, along with some fried chickpeas.  It was a great start to our meal.  We then shared the Giardino pizza.  It was fabulous!  Great crust, lots of veggies, and a modest amount of their house pulled mozzarella.  Delish!  Will definitely stop in again next time we're in the area.",

We called ahead and they said that they wouldn't take any more reservations for that night, but would take my cell number and give us a call when a table would be ready. The hostess said it would take about 30 minutes, so we took our time relaxing at my friend's apartment and started heading over after about 20 minutes. It worked out great because while we were about to park the car (huge lot with plenty of spaces), we got a call from the restaurant saying our table was ready. I love when timing works out perfectly.   We were seated quickly and our server, Nick, came to the table and greeted us. We told him we haven't eaten there before and we asked him for our recommendations. Everything he gave us was spot on!   There weren't many of us and we just wanted to share so this is what we ate. We ordered the poutine with the fried egg and short rib. Got half orders each of the bruschetta with prosciutto, short rib, and beer braised short pork butt. And we also ordered the porco e funghi pizza with additional spicy soppressata. The meal was absolutely delicious. We also got the pumpkin spice cake and the restaurant put a candle on top for my friend to blow out. The restaurant owner even came out to the table and personally greeted us and wished my friend a happy birthday!   The whole experience was simply top notch, from the hostess calling us when the table was ready, to the server having outstanding food recommendations, and to the quality of the food. It is definitely on my list of favorite places to go to and I can't wait to go back.",

I started with a fruity, crisp Riesling: Dr. Loosen, if you're into that. To eat, I had the arugula salad with CANDIED CASHEWS. Who candies cashews?! These guys, that's who. Then I had a pizza with apples, dates, and fennel. I traded the Gorgonzola for fresh mozzarella and it was heavenly. It was bigger than the plate it came on, and I was afraid I wouldn't finish it. Of course, I had to make myself stop, because I was full but still eating! Again, who puts dates and apples on pizza?! Again: the nook, that's who. Genius.",

We live within walking distance (which is both great and dangerous) and Nook is part of the reason we want to stay in this area!  Pizza is always awesome. Appetizers are SO GOOD (we went a week or so ago with my family and had the arancini and the artichoke special - we basically licked the plates clean!). Drinks are amazing - especially the specialty Mules. My favorite was the white pear, but each one has been awesome.  We got my brother in law hooked on the Pasta Crepe - and the four pepper cream sauce it comes with is one of the best things I've ever tasted.   Desserts are always amazing and unique and service is always great, too. And they take reservations, which we love. All in all, Nook is one of our favorite places in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Nothing special here - actually extremely disappointing.   Was here last Friday with my wife and we decided to eat at the bar. Ordered a few beers, the Hummus appetizer plate and that basic Italian staple ... a simple Margherita Pizza.   The interior vibe honestly feels more like a slightly hipster bar and not so much a restaurant per se. There is a decent size wood burning pizza oven off to one side of the bar. From my vantage point there wasn't much \"fire\" or wood in the oven and boy was I right. No exaggeration but our little Margherita pizza took almost 30 min to be served! Are you kidding me? I ordered the pizza well done as I usually do but a typical wood oven at say Cibo, Bianco or Grimaldi's (all far superior to Nook btw) should cook a pizza at maybe 750+ degrees in less than 5 min. I know our pizza was in that oven for an eternity as I watched the guy moving it around for 30 min while we sat twiddling our thumbs hungrily waiting for our pie.   In the end the wait wasn't worth it. Pizza was not well done, too much cheese, tasteless dough (especially compared with the wonderful Federal Pizza) and nothing special.   The hummus plate was also a dud - made far too thick and pasty with not much flavor.   This is a flash in the pizza pan Yelpers. If this operation exists in a year I will be shocked. Apparently the owners came from Cowboy Ciao as past workers there. Sad that they can't figure out how to cook a pizza.   I'd come back for a beer - definitely not the food.",

This place is truly amazing.    Last night, we were in search of a late night dinner spot and Nook seemed to fit the bill.  I haven't been in Phoenix in years and in all honesty, I was skeptical as we approached.  Restaurants in strip malls don't often have an appealing ambiance.  Nook was a True exception.    From the moment we entered, I knew it was a good choice.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess and grabbed two seats at the bar.  The vibe was perfect - a low hum of activity, GREAT music, and TVs silent with sports.  We asked about favorites on the menu (from a person who ended up being the owner) and went with the recommended Arancini, Fig Bruschetta, and Arugula salad - although I wanted just about everything he recommended.  All were outstanding - so much so that we ordered a second round of the Arancini.  And to accompany it, a beautiful glass of Saldo Zin.  The perfect pairing!  We ended with the Affagato dessert...so good and pretty much the best I've ever had.    The service was outstanding as well - the bartender was friendly and extremely attentive.  My travel rule is never repeat a restaurant on the same trip....I might have to break it this time!",

We also shared the pork butt bruschetta which was like eating candy. Our last item shared was one of the pizzas, the Giardino.

We started withe the arancini to start and it was filled with gooey cheese and had a crunchy outside...I could probably eat a million of those delicious little balls. The marinara sauce was delicious as well -its the simple things that can make anything better.   We then had the ribeye and the calabrese pizza with a side salad. The greens were really basic but fresh and crunchy with yummy veggies mixed with a very lemony vinaigrette. The pizza was delicious- the crust itself was garlicy and perfectly crunchy. The fresh pulled mozzarella was amazing and gooey and creamy. The sausage was perfect with the garlic and caramelized onions. Boyfriends ribeye was delicious and the gorgonzola risotto was amazing. It had a great saffron rice taste at the beginning and then the aftertaste was the tart yummy gorgonzola. Our one complaint about it was the platting. It was served in a bowl with the big ribeye on top and risotto and veggies on the bottom. It wasn't that pretty, which didn't matter because the dish was awesome but it also wasn't very functional for that piece of meat. It made it hard to cut the meat on top of the risotto and then you had to literally dig the veggies out. So hopefully someone sees this and can take it into consideration.  We didnt have any room for dessert but it all looked awesome. Their happy hour has a great menu and great prices. I think this place will be a once in a while for a full dinner but  we both agreed we would add this to our list of places to go for happy hour. You can beat it.",

Well, opening the doors to this place you go from a ugh I don't want to be seen in front of this building (JK) to a whole different feeling. Cool little dark feel and vibe to this place. Raised, half circled booths line the length of the long restaurant and gives it a more intimate feel. Of course, I came for takeout, idiot!! Trust me I will be back to enjoy the restaurant next time. Anyways, for starters we got the fig bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto (you put this on anything and I'm all in!!). Nailed it!! The Diavolo pizza was next! Now next to prosciutto on my list of meats I must devour is soppressata. Well chorizo, then soppressata. Thin sliced soppressata accompanied by fresh mozzarella and basil. Hellz yeah good. The soppressata has some good heat to it so be warned if you don't like spice! Nook is yet one of many unreal good pizza joints in town. I swear it must be these chefs reproducing at alarming rates. How can you have so many great pizza places? Nook Nailed it!!! I will update my review after I eat here. Might be a 5 star",

When i got the bill it was and additional $3 for truffle oil, $3 for something else and they added $3 for something my wife had asked for as well.  I'd by happy to pay for it if they told me about it.  Food was OK besides that.  2 pizzas and a beer for $50 after tip, try somewhere else. I won't go back with so many options in Phoenix.",

(the joys of a two top table)  We started the meal with some short rib bruschetta which was absolutely scrumptious. I could've ordered another plate of them and just had that for dinner. When it came to our main course we made the smart choice of sharing a pizza (Porco e funghi) It was very good and had a good amount of cheese to add ons. We couldve gotten dessert but nothing seemed too appetizing to get.   It definitely has a date ambiance feel. Low overhead lights, candles on each table. The only that killed our date was a woman next to us complaining a bit too loud how the gluten free crust didn't have flavor. In my opinion, if you are looking getting gluten free then you cannot expect the flavor of regular. Also the server corrected how we said bruschetta a couple times. Its rude to correct a customer like that.",

It was in a shopping center that you would never think this real cool urban restaurant would lie. Easy and lots of parking  (close to Zipps). When we walked in, the place was pretty busy, the very nice hostess said we could sit at the bar and wait for a table to be ready.    We sat at the bar and the bartender Anthony got us our drink orders while we waited. He also recommended the arancini ball appetizer so we ordered that. And the presentation and taste was delicious. After waiting for a while, we loved all the service we were getting from Anthony so we decided to stay sitting at the bar and eat dinner there just so we could keep him as a server !  I ordered the prosciutto pizza and my roommate ordered the chicken marsala. Both were absolutely, mouth-watering delicious.  The pizza was so light and the Ingredients were fresh. The chicken marsala had so much flavor! I already know I want to go back and try the salmon.  Definitely would recommend this place to ANYONE and ask for Anthony at the bar! He made our night that much more better!",

Amazing food, handcrafted cocktails and excellent ambience-- whether you're looking for a slightly upscale place to watch the game or a fun place for girls night out, Nook is perfect.   At this point we've been multiple times and ordered a lot of the menu. My favorite app is Arancini. Amazing cheesy rice balls in marinara, I would come just for these. Any of the pizzas we've ordered have been killer. Our favorite is the calabrese- sweet sausage, caramelized onions and Calabrian chiles-- perfect.   Bartenders and wait staff complete the upscale chill vibe. We never have to worry about the quality of the beverages we get no matter what we order. My favorite, obviously, is their version of the Moscow Mule. Give it a try. Xoxo",

Nook had been on my bookmarks list for awhile for the gluten free pizza, but my husband wasn't down with eating a cheeseless pizza so he went for the short ribs instead. He absolutely loved them! He raved about them with every bite, and he was equally happy with the sides. My pizza was just ok. It reminded me of pizza that I can make at home, and I was hoping for something with a little more wow.  What was more impressive was the cocktails. Not a long list, but the two we got were both very good. Service was impeccable. Both the manager and our waiter really made us feel welcome and at home. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Maybe more like 4 1/2, but rounded up due to the great service on both occasions.  A special shout-out to Ale (I'm spelling her name correctly, but it's pronounced Allie), who really knew the menu completely, and was able to answer all of our questions patiently and in detail when we inquired about ingredients and preparation.    I'm always partial to restaurants that deliver more than what you would expect from the appearance of the place.  Nook has a very basic look, a combination of booths and a bar and tables.  You go in expecting OK or average bar food but it is so much better than that.  I've been twice with large enough parties that I've been able to taste a number of these really well-prepared dishes.  The arancini are a perfect meld of the risotto, mozzarella and Pomodoro.  These were definitely prepared by someone who knew the flavor profile for perfect arancini.  The poutine is absolutely as special as others have written earlier.  Poutine is still not a dish that can be easily found on American menus, and this poutine is terrific.  Do get it with fried egg, which really adds to the potato and gravy flavors, but I'd advise skipping the optional short rib, which we all agreed made the dish too heavy.  And believe me, it is already a heavy dish, but so, so good.  The scallops were done perfectly, moist, flavorful, with just the right amount of resistance to the bite.  And the pizza, much to my surprise, was excellent.  I'm from Chicago, as much a pizza town as any, and I personally tend to prefer thin and crispy crusts.  Yet Nook's ingredients were so high end, and the crust, while softer than I usually like, had a pull and chewiness that was actually quite good.  Really fresh ingredients, and sausage that was bursting with flavor.  I highly recommend Nook.  The food and service are much more than you're going to expect when you first walk through the door, and you'll have a tasty and fun experience.",

Unfortunately, I didn't order their pizza because I had pizza the other day. I kind of regret it. When you notice that their menu consists of mostly pizza, you probably should get it. But I didn't. I just ordered off the happy hour menu - a glass of Cab, the Poutine, the Pork Butt Bruschetta, and the Chicken Chop salad.   Everything was good for a happy hour thing and my partner and I practically devoured most of it. I think I'll be back for dinner and try the pizza next time.",

Their pizzas are exquisite with flavorful, crispy crust and flavor profiles that are unique but not over the top. The Poutine appetizer and their bolognese are delicious! On the pizza side of the equation, the Porco y Funghi and the Calabrese are two of our faves. Servers are amazing too, particularly Ali who always remembers us and is very attentive.",

I then had the filet and the wife had the bolognese. The filet was just surprising in its presentation and flavor. I'm not typically a fan of sauce on steaks but this was exceptional all around and perfectly cooked. The wife loved her bolognese as well.  Finally, the nookerdoodle dessert was insane and brilliant, and the service was excellent. Our waiter Ralph was just on point.  We'll definitely be back. A real fun menu, great staff, and delicious.",

    "text": "Talk about an uncomfortable experience!  We went to Nook this weekend and I think it's safe to say that this is the last time we will be visiting this establishment.  We decided to pop in for a cocktail and pizza, so we sat at the bar and had one of the owners wait on us.  By his tone and conversation, it was blatantly obvious that he did not want to be there and couldn't wait to close up and go home.  He was not friendly nor helpful and overall the whole service was really uncomfortable.  That combined with the fact that our pizza (the Giardino ) was just meh on flavor really put a big damper on the evening.    It's too bad because we've come in several times before and had decent food and service, but this experience really left us with a sour taste for all that is Nook.",

    "text": "Great pizza, and this place is up there with the best. First night, I was a skeptic and I needed another night, but tonight it was pretty good!  Attentive hostess, both nights, and very friendly with a \"nice to meetcha, glad you're here\" kind of welcome...I like that. Being A one-man show, I wasn't sure about taking up an entire booth, but I was treated as if I owned the place, \"wow, cool\"!  Menu simple, and if there's a question, ask and the Italian will be explained to you, but I'm finding that no better lesson is just diving in, so that's why I'm making it a point to keep coming back and trying every damn thing on the menu until I learn first hand what I'm eating. Actually, here's a tip...when the owner asks how the meal is, don't give a one word answer, he really cares...give him your input; you'll be pleasantly amazed at HIS input and suggestions on what's good...I like this place!  As I often attest to in my reviews, it's not necessarily the food, but the manners, and personality that it's served with...the Nook is that kind of place. I'll be back, and oh by the way, the decorations personally hung by the owner, Frank, for Christmas, deserves a applause!",

    "text": "We were looking for a new joint and decided on Nook, we are glad we did.  Like some of the other reviews have said all of the signs look pretty similar here so look around and don't just assume they left.  Well enough on that.  Nook is pretty small, It's a good name choice for sure.  Had no problems getting a table, but it was only about six pm on a Saturday.  The dining room is simple and straight forward, one wall is a long booth/bench with the tables having a chair facing the bench.  On the left as you enter is a good looking bar.  Service was great.  Really friendly, obviously a fan of what the kitchen is doing.  I had the chicken Marsala, it was the best I've ever had....the only one (usually I'm a Piccatta fan).  But this was pretty damn good, I especially liked the mushrooms...I'd sort of think they had been soaked in a decent Port but I think that is the Marsala wine, which I had thought of as like sherry before but anyways the mushrooms were great.  Oh and the fresh pasta, delightful.  She had the prosciutto pizza, again excellent.  I like the arugula mix on top.  Is this going to replace our usual favorite in the area? It just might.",

Our server recommended the Thai cocktail and it was delish! We also enjoyed the arancini app and had the special pasta dish. We shared a pizza, which was very good, but we both felt there are other places in the Valley with better pizza. I'll qualify that with the fact we only tried one here, so I don't think it's a totally fair judgement.  We'd definitely come back to this place!",

    "text": "So, I graduated with a double major and 2 months later, I was still unemployed as fate would have it. Thus, instead of wallowing in ice cream and Netflix, I decided to gorge my sorrows down at all the pizzerias in Arcadia after every failed interview like a True champ during this slow period of agony.  I still have to write reviews for the other places, but Nook is definitely freshest in my mind. This review speaks mostly to the prosciutto and meat lovers. If you happen to be a gluten-free, veggie lover, you and your cult can stop reading as of right now. Most other pizza places only give you the smaller option of like a 7\" pizza, but here at Nook, their standard is a lot bigger and honestly you could split between two and not break the bank. Not a single space on the pizza is left empty, even if you only ordered just one simple topping because their fresh-pulled mozzarella is like an entirely new topping, with certain areas with bigger chunks of cheese than other areas. Only thing that kind of irked me was that I asked to add spinach and instead of sprinkling it throughout the crust and baking it, they just put a bunch of raw spinach in the middle which isn't exactly what I was expecting.   It seriously was like my eyes were deceiving me. There was so much prosciutto on my pizza that I can only compare it as if you were unfolding an onion. Layer after layer, it was never ending, like it was saying \"Don't worry Loretta, we'll always be here for you.\" So reassuring and gratifying, just like the guy's voice from those Allstate commercials.   We also had the Pork Butt appetizer and those were right on par as well, not too much sauce to just overwhelm the taste buds and just a little coleslaw for some coolness and tang.   Great place for a date and service is very friendly and flexible with options. Great place that takes the extra time to concentrate on careful portions.",

Bruscetta was good,  very small portion of two pieces, perhaps my fault for assuming an appetizer would encompass more than two pieces?   Short rib was dry, wasabi shallot accoutrement is really a swing and a miss.  Mashed potatoes were really decadent, artfully under seasoned which is a good call when paired with a short rib in my opinion, steamed veggie side also good.  Too bad the short rib couldn't keep par.  My search for decent food delivered in the desert continues.",

Jorge was a great waiter and the only thing I could imagine him giving us after was a ride home, he was funny and honest. The desert I wanted was the bread pudding but at the moment they are not serving it (per Jorge it may be back).

There were a few TVs with baseball on which was great. The environment was laid back but casually elegant. In other words, with the right person, this place can be either romantic or fun or both! We started with a charcuterie board which featured, some nice meats and 2 cheeses, olives and spreads. Very good. I had a mixed greens salad with red wine vinaigrette. Very fresh tasting, simple but good. For the entrees, he had the Diavolo pizza. It wasn't amazing but pretty good when I tried a bite.I like my pizza a little crispier. I had the chicken marsala which was very good. It was made with Gran Marnier and you could taste the sweetness through the marsala sauce. Everything arrived promptly. There weren't that many people there but a few came after we did. The waiter I think was Ralph and he was very friendly and helpful with the menu. The wine list is nothing special but there are a couple good ones. The one we tried was the Yangarra Grenache which we both felt was flat with no lustre, no finish. But at least it was half  off.  I know the bottles of wine were half off that time on Sunday so I am curious to see what other specials they have as I'm sure I would go back.",

I on the other hand was in love with the Giardino pizza and as recommended by our waiter, I added sausage and truffle oil to the thin crust pizza. The pizza was definitely worth the calories and carbs! They too serve gluten free pizza. We had the Affogato for dessert....yummy soft chocolate chip cookie layered with ice cream and shot of espresso...very interesting combo.",

I contacted the owner and he denied responsibility, saying it takes at least 24 hours for foodborne illness to present, after ingesting the infected food.  The other food I ate leading up to my illness was the same home prepared food I had been eating all week, so I am certain that the filet mignon I had at nook was the culprit. I looked up the timeline for when symptoms present, and what I read indicated that symptoms can appear as soon as 1 to 6 hours after eating the affected food, which aligns perfectly with when my symptoms appeared.  See this link for confirmation: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFoodborne_illness&s=a19a20a378f283b0f3ac881b1b70809ed3a34111935b49e59c703209ff0ab97a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fo...</a>  This directly contradicts what the owner said about the timeline for symptoms.

Super cute, great atmosphere. The wine list was very good and so was the food! The arancini's were good. I ordered the steak which was cooked to perfection. I subbed out the risotto for cauliflower mash, which was the best I have ever had. Overall I wasn't expecting to get a steak but I'm glad I did. My friend got the Diavola pizza which was simple but good, spicy in fact. And a lot of pizza. We finished with the bread pudding which was great. Nice crust, tart fruit and caramel ice cream. And Matt really took care of us! Overall a great experience, and a great addition to the neighborhood!",

    "text": "If there is a \"good\" pizza place in Phoenix, you know damn well that I will eventually try it out.  The Nook had been on my bookmarked list for awhile now, I just never am down in this area though.  I watched a movie downtown mid afternoon, and wanted to eat somewhere semi nearby to avoid some traffic.  Bookmark removed...The Nook,  it was!  I drove down, parked, walked inside, and was directed to a seat at the bar.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender poured me a glass of ice water.  I LOVE when that happens.  She didn't ask, she just offered it up!  Great service from the get go!  I browsed over the menu and decided to go with the Giardino Pizza.  Sitting at the bar was nice!  They have 2 big screens that were showing basketball, plus, you get a front row seat of watching the guys make pizza.  They have their pizza station and oven at one end of the bar.  It helped pass the time.  About 10 minutes later, my pizza was presented in front of me.  Here is how it was.............  The Giardino-  This pizza has house pulled mozzarella, parmesan, spinach, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I am usually anti vegetable (I rarely eat them alone), but for whatever reason, I have come across some great veggie pizzas here in Phoenix, and this one sounded very good and I decided to check it out.    The pizza was placed in front of me and I noticed that it was larger than most \"individual\" pizzas served at most places.  It was cut into 8 nice sized slices.  I picked up a piece and took a bite and was pretty darn impressed.  The crust held up and didn't flop over, so I folded my piece and ate it pretty quick.  All those veggies combined for some great flavor.  The only particular veggie that could have been better was maybe the onions.  I prefer a red/raw type onion on my pizza.  These caramelized ones were a bit too soft and threw a different flavor profile in the mix.  It would have been a better pizza with red onions.  All the other veggies were great though!  It had tons of mushrooms, lots of soft roasted tomatoes, decent amount of spinach, just enough garlic and mozzarella and a nice sprinkling of pamesan.  These were all laid upon a thin crust dough with an outer crust that had just enough thickness and chew to it.  It was a very good pizza!  Service was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The pizza was $14.00 which was fair.  I will definitely be back because I want to try out their Calabrese Pizza.  The atmosphere was cozy and chill.  There were other solo diners at the bar, so I didn't feel out of place eating by myself.  It was a cool spot and I will be back soon!",

Large portion, tender, lots of flavor.. really couldn't ask for anything else. The sides that came with it were also perfect pairings.  My second visit I ordered the Diavolo pizza. I really wanted to order the pork chop again but the pictures of the Pizza looked great and I had to order that. The diavolo had fresh mozzarella, soppressata, red sauce and EVOO. It was great.   The next time we visit Nook, it'll be a hard choice on what to order.",

I had a mule to start off with for a drink and it was unique. Not like any regular mule i've ever had. We had the arancini and traditional caprese to start off with. For dinner I got the linguine salmon. At first I thought it was going to be a weird concept but after trying it, I loved it. Someone else at the table for a pepperoni pizza which they ate the entire thing, a salad, and the chicken marsala which I also really enjoyed. The place was really cute and dark. The service was decent and I was able to watch the game at the bar. Overall, I really enjoyed the meal.",

The food was excellent.  We tried a few of the bruschetta (fig and chicken artichoke).  My friend had the pizza which was excellent (thin crust). I had to try a piece.  I had the bolognese pasta which was yummy.  The pasta is made in house and you can tell.  The sauce was amazing, and I almost felt like licking the plate (but I know that's not appropriate).   Nick our waiter was very friendly and provided us with good service.  I look forward to going back again.",

    "text": "I heard about this place from Check Please Arizona. Have been dying to try it for some time. Finally got to last night, meeting a friend for dinner. We had just missed happy hour which was a big bummer since it would have been 1/2 price appetizers. Ended up splitting 2 of the brushetta's with my friend - the pork butt and the short ribs. Both were pretty good, but other than a pile of tasty meat on a tiny piece of bread, it was kind of not interesting enough and also a small amount for the price.  We got 2 half orders which cost $8 for just two pieces.  I also tried the fig, prosciutto and goat cheese.  Decided I don't like prosciutto - it was like unchewable cardboard.  The fig jam was tasty but there wasn't enough and there was a tiny drop of goat cheese. Overall a bit disappointing.  My friend convinced me to order dinner which I hesitated on. I don't go to fancy or expensive places with an exception of Hillstones. I eventually ordered a $28 chicken dinner and it was disappointing. The spice rub on it was nice, but the texture of the chicken was rubbery and it wasn't a huge piece. It was a chicken breast with bone attached (yuk) and some bone and cartilage attached on the underside.  If I'm paying $28 bucks - you need to take the crap off my food please!  The mashed potatoes were fine, there were some great crispy sweet peas I really liked and a nice sauce.  In the end, I highly regretted spending that kind of money on a meal of that quality. I paid about $60 total (tax, tip) for a meal that wasn't the best and I was hungry an hour later and had to swing by McDonalds!   On the pros side - the interior of the restaurant is very nice. Exposed brick and duct work, Edison lights, candle light, comfy, elevated booths. I liked the look of it all and the location was great in central Phoenix. The staff was also very attentive and pleasant.  I just can't get past the so-so ness of the food.   If I were to go back, I would only do so at happy hour and I would focus on getting the bruschetta's which were nice. Maybe try a lesser priced pizza.",

My boyfriend and I ordered pizza take out and loved it so much that we went back to spend our Valentine's Day dinner. We started with the arancini, he ordered the pork chop and I ordered the salmon pasta.. wow. Arancini was delish. The salmon pasta was no doubt one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had (and I'm Italian.. I know my pasta). My boyfriend devoured his entire plate.  There was live music, but not that loud obnoxious live music that you find in some places. The singer was really good! There is a cute small outdoor patio that overlooks a courtyard with a fountain. This is the most perfect date spot! I can say we will most definitely be back soon!",

My husband and I came here for dinner last night, because we wanted to try the new neighborhood restaurant, and had heard good things. When we arrived all of the tables were full, so we had a drink at the bar until one became available. The bartender was very helpful with my wine selection, and offered a taste before I committed to my order. Their bar stools are super comfortable (they were more like padded chairs on stilts) so much that we almost just stayed there to eat our dinner, but decided to wait for a table instead. I can see myself in the future hanging out here just for drinks and watching the pizzas being made at the end of the bar, as the ambiance is very relaxing and they were playing awesome music.   We were seated at one of the spacious rounded booths, which was also very comfortable. Our server Kaylita was awesome, very nice, and totally on point throughout our dinner. For food we decided on the deconstructed Asian salad with Salmon cooked medium and the florentine pizza. The salad came out first, the salmon was cooked perfectly and was seasoned very well, the Asian veggies were crunchy and fresh and the ginger rice was very good with subtle flavor. Our pizza was very good too, the ricotta was very and creamy, you could tell they used quality ingredients, the roasted tomatoes were marinated and not mushy, and the crusty was perfect. My only complaint was that the pizza was a little too oily.   After my great experience, I will definitely be adding Nook into my neighborhood rotation whether it's for happy hour at the bar, or for dinner.",

    "text": "Cozy neighborhood eatery with a wood burning pizza oven. The short rib bruschetta was entirely forgettable, but we also ordered the Porco e Fungi pizza. After the disappointing appetizer, I had mentally mocked the descriptors on the menu...\"house pulled mozzarella\" ...seriously ..it's cheese. How good could it be? Boy was I wrong!  The pizza was *perfectly* cooked. A Lightly crisped crust with just the right amount of sauce. Impeccably juicy sausage, nestled in pillows of supple mozzarella.  (Possibly buratta, or any of mozzarella's more tender varieties) Warm brown mushrooms bursting with flavor all topped with freshly shredded basil   Nook sells a few decorative/bed and bath totchkes at the front of the store. The ladies room had sample of one of their salted herbal scrubs. (Simply divine!) I really wanted to buy one, but I couldn't find it on the shelf.  We stooped in for lunch just because we were curious. We'll definitely be back for happy hour and dinner",

We had empty glasses of water and it took him a while to fill it. Other than that he did do a decent job. The food was amazing! I had the Chicken Artichoke Bruschetta. They don't skimp on the chicken or artichoke and the crostini was crunchy and baked to perfection. My coworkers got a chicken pizza which had several types of vegetables. It was tasty and wasn't too greasy. Another group of coworkers got the diavolo pizza which they devoured and enjoyed. The food prices are reasonable for the amount you get. The drink prices are great! They also had live music which was amazing! The guys voice was beautiful. Overall, it was a fun time, and I will be coming back, for the happy hour!",

It was fun to sit and watch them make pizzas. Although small, it was not overly noisy. It did not take 45 minutes for our table to be ready so we were escorted there. Our waiter was great, friendly and personable. He recommended a pizza that we went with and we also ordered the filet. Food was prompt and hot. The pizzas are amazing with great flavor and the filet was cooked perfectly and was also melt in you mouth good. I would highly recommend trying this place out!",

We started with Arugula salad and A Caprese Bruschetta both of which were tasty.  We decided on the Vongole Pizza and Short Ribs.  Short Ribs were Delicious and came with Mashed Potato and Haricot Vert.  Pizza was excellent, the fresh Mozzerla was amazing.  My only suggestion would be to not chop the little neck clams so you can have a more prominent bite and have the ability taste them.  There is so much richness that I feel they got lost in the mix.

Drinks are always refilled immediately, plates are cleared off the table right away and they check on you just the right amount (enough to be helpful, not often enough to be annoying).   The prices are reasonable, especially at happy hour (do yourself a favor and order the $2 beer option at HH--I can't remember the name, but it is delicious and SO affordable). We've tried several pizzas, salads and appetizers and you really cannot make a bad choice. I think my favorites are the arancini and fungi pizza.    Also, my boyfriend and I really like the music they play here (not important to everyone but important to us) and its fun to sit at the bar or a table nearby and watch the pizza chef do his thang.  All in all, a great neighbor joint that we will continue to frequent!",

Would have been nice if they let them cool or at least warn you before serving them straight out of the fryer. 3 days later I still have very painful blisters in my mouth. They were OK, but certainly not worth the burn...   Short rib \"bruschetta\" was really dry.   Artichoke bruschetta was ok, but mushy, salty, and not too impressive.   Caprese bruschetta was tasty with the balsamic reduction... But I view that as something pretty hard to mess up.   Callabrese pizza was OK, but the crust was both soggy and ridiculously tough at the same time. The portion under the toppings was incredibly soggy, while the portion without toppings was hard, and tasted \"stale\"... I noticed I wasn't the only person who left the crusts and didn't eat them.   I won't be going back.",

I actually give it my vote for best pizza in town. I stand by the Porco e Funghi pizza with its floury fire-oven crust and fresh sausage. On a normal day, I cannot stand arancini. When I tasted Nook's I immediately became a fan. The outside is crispy and the inside is just right - not too mushy and not too overdone. I cannot believe it's only $6 for a half-order. Yum! Try the Chicken Chop for a refreshing and creative twist on salad. It's so hard to find good customer service these days. Here at Nook the manager comes out and greets visitors frequently. Hands down..the service at Nook is always top-notch. Sit at the bar and get friendly, fast service. Or sit at a booth and the server will give menu suggestions. On more than one occasion I've been given free 'samples' of menu dishes. Every time I've come in, they remember I love red wine and give tastings from their rotating wine menu. You can also order ahead and carry-out your meal. A plus! I've seen kid-friendly families here and also I've had a handful of swanky romantic date nights. The happy hour deals are a total steal and the Sunday specials are great too. Add Nook to your list.",

The food is excellent,  and I managed to make it in for happy hour so I got excellent value for my money. I ordered the arancini, and the beer braised pork butt bruschetta for my apps. The arancini were one of the best appetizers I've had in my entire life. The bruscetta were good but they cooled down very quickly so they became proportionally less attractive. They were also piled high so they were a little difficult to fit in the mouth.   The entree I had was the Salmon. I have to admit, I didn't go for seafood. I was going to get chicken, but I decided to gamble and asked my waitress what she ordered when she ate there. Paid off very nicely. I was extremely satisfied with the fish, nice lightly charred with just a hint of the rosemary sprig that it was speared with. The squash were very flavorful with an unexpected but very pleasant spiciness. And the mashed cauliflower was amazing, I love cauliflower but I've never thought to make it like that before.   I live in Texas, just in phoenix for the weekend on business, but this place will definitely be on my itinerary next time I come through here!",

We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and even though they were out of the one on their menu they aye a back up (not sure of the name though). It tasted great. For appetizers we had  the arancini balls which were perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside and they were literally just out of the oven which made them even better. I also tried the the artichoke for an appetizer which was good but a big PIA to eat, but the sauce that came with it was amazing. For the main course I had the short rib which was cooked well, but honestly I think the sides were even better which were the green beans which had a garlicky and buttery taste (just how I like my green beans) and the mashed potatoes which were delicious as well. I would highly recommend this place for a chilled relaxed kind of night and will come here again and again.",

We asked the cameriere if they could make a sangria (not on the menu) and he didn't only say yes, he noted that the bar tender was a Level 2 Sommelier and went on to explain exactly what ingredients he would use to make my wife's sangria.  We ordered the Charcuterie and the Giardano Pizza... The Charcuterie may as well be an entree for two, and again the cameriere went on to explain each and every ingredient on it with \"gusto\"! Delicious to the last bite ( we ended up dumping some of the soprassetta and Hungarian salami onto the pizza. We could only manage to eat a slice of the pizza (since we were already stuffed with all the meats, cheeses, fruits, sauces, bread, etc) from our \"appetizer\", and it beat our expectations. You could taste every ingredient (tomato, basil, fungi, spinach, olive oil, fresh mozzarella...) and they were really fresh and flavorful... If you haven't yet tried NOOK... Hurry up and do!",

The aroma from the open front door out in to the parking lot is enough to fill the place with pedestrian traffic! It is a small affair and can be a tad warm when full but the food & service are perfect. We sat at the bar rather than waiting for a table and had several appetizers including the chicken chop (salad), hummus plate, langoustine and diavolo pizza. The pizza was my favorite. A thin, crunchewy crust with just the right amount of toppings. The spicy soppressata was a little too warm for my wife but I liked it. The hummus was very fresh, as were the veggies that came with it. The staff was attentive without being on top of you every moment. The owners were there and getting their hands dirty with their staff. You can tell they are a tight knit group that enjoys working with each other. They made a point to stop and talk with their customers and support the staff the entire time I was there. Finally, they gave my friend a free dessert for her birthday! The Affogato is a mix of lemon ice cream, chocolate crumble and a chocolate sauce with a shot of espresso on top. I tried it and it was awesome! Check this place out, but be prepared for a wait if you want a table on a busy night. It's great to know Phoenix is attracting and supporting establishments like Nook. Cheers!",

There was only 1 other table occupied and 2 people at the bar but, our main course took forever (and 4 of us had salads)!  Once we were served, 1 salad dragged for approx 5 minutes and we all sat there waiting - No apology, no explanation.  My brother and I left and both said we won't go back.",

    "text": "Wow! Thought I had found a comfortable pizza place in the hood, The Nook. I enjoyed the food and I had recommended it to some of my colleagues. Then it happened. Some minor confusion over seating. To be honest after standing at the bar for 15 min waiting for something to open up I was a bit too eager to take a seat at a table that had just vacated. My bad! something the hostess pointed out with a vicious glare and something muttered as she walked by with another couple. So I was embarrassed, really embarrassed. I didn't realize she was trying to seat the couple at that table. That didn't register because those folks were 15 min behind us. Well damn that's awkward. Within an instant a second staff arrived, sent by her to ask if I had permission to occupy said table. No use explaining that the bartender gave us the heads up that people were leaving. Did I say I was embarrassed but then again something else, now I hadn't any desire for that pizza. My date and I were so uncomfortable we simply told the second staff that we wouldn't need the table and we left. It gets worse. I thought I had better call back and speak with the manager, instead I got Frank (one of the owners). I began by telling him how embarrassed we felt, his response was that I didn't really have any concerns to be embarrassed, and that he didn't know what I wanted from him. He said that his staff were appropriate. Damn i wanted him to validate my hurt feeling. Well it didn't happen and I'm still feeling a little put out. So what about service recovery I'm thinking. No need for that, right Frank? So frankly, I'm mad and thinking where else in the hood to get a pie without all this drama. That ought to be difficult in Arcadia. Later my date explained to me that that's what discrimination feels like. I'm trying to chew on that. Like so many i want to deny that people judge but I know they do. That's hard for a Wyoming boy to comprehend. Maybe she's right she has felt that sting many times. I know it felt pretty bad so I told Frank and the good folks at The Nook adios and no more positive recommendations from me. Even that didn't seem to affect Frank. Frank, it seems, is very self assured. Sometimes, it seems, service recovery just is not worth the cost.",

Bar was also doing double duty as pizza oven, food prep, purse storage....generally cluttered & unsure of its purpose, maybe could be said of whole restaurant? The best part of meal were the pork butt & short rib bruschetta, my halibut tacos were also tasty, but the pasta crepe was bland & chicken overcooked. As a final note, it was very pricey (96$ for2 ) AND we were asked to move our seats. Not a great experience.",

Clean,  and smartly decorated, with comfortable booths and cute menus.  Happy hour prices till 6pm.  They have a limited menu, which is a good thing.  The staff were sincerely happy, friendly, attentive, knowledgable and efficient.  The food was excellent in freshness, presentation, and flavor and cooked to perfection.  Remember to ask what things mean on the menu, like langestino, and salami for dessert(actually chocolate and nuts with dried fruit).

We brought our baby and toddler and it didn't phase them. The owner or manager even came over to see how our dinner was and comment on how great our kids we're being (which was being generous) and the guy making pizza gave our toddler dough to play with. Family friendly and good food. We'll be going back.",

    "text": "I think this place is just awesome.   First the appetizers and bruschetta come in 1/2 order or full order- this to me is genius!!  I love having something small to start and having the option.  It also allows you to try more!  We ordered two half apps and a pizza and this was perfect for 2 people!  We started with the 1/2 order of Aranchini (3 pieces) - risotto was perfectly cooked and just the right amount of cheese mixed in and fried to perfection.  The pomodoro sauce was a great accompaniment with a balsamic reduction - delicious!! Second appetizer we had the chicken artichoke bruschetta - this combination was so good and perfectly warm.   For the pizza we ordered the Calabrese - full of flavor and each item complimenting the other from the sausage and caramelized onions to the chili peppers and cheese! Definitely recommend!!   Service was great- waters were always full and checked on us just the right amount of times and was quick to order (we were hungry) :)  Atmosphere - always a 10 love the space and decor!",

For my dinner I had the salmon with cauliflower mash and grilled squash. This is something I often make at home but they truly perfected it. The salmon was absolutely delicious, I wish I got their recipe! Our waitresses were also incredibly pleasant and always made sure we were attended too. I definitely recommend this place for a dinner if you're downtown.",

Her boyfriend has even given me a rare \"I will punch anyone in the face for you once\" card. Like if I need it, no questions asked, he will punch you in the face for me. We might have been drunk when this card was offered.   Luckily, there was no need for summoning up that card at dinner, because it was delicious. And that's hard to do considering I made a bunch of sad changes to my salad in order to be healthy. I was like no this, no that, no fun, don't hate me. The server was very kind and what was left of my salad was fresh and delicious. Meanwhile, the lovebirds sitting next to me ate pizza. F*ck those guys.   (I'm totally coming back for the pizza.)",

    "text": "Overall rating: 3.5 Stars In short, the food was good but a few mishaps making A-OK+.  After hearing good things about Nook, I was really excited to try them. Then, I received a giftcard and that sealed the deal. The first time my husband and I stopped by, they were closed for a holiday/vacation break. Disappointed, we decided we would try them some other time.   The next time, a few months later, we arrived around 4:30pm. As we walked in, they informed us that the grill wasn't working - they could only make a few select appetizers and flatbreads. They reassured that it would be fixed shortly and we ordered the arancini appetizer to tide us over.   To drink, I ordered a Moscow Mule. Halfway through my mule, our waiter informed us that the grill was working so we ordered a pizza and my husband ordered the special - a prime rib with mashed potatoes. From where we were sitting, I could see the pizza being prepped. When the pizza was done, it sat for a bit and several of the waitstaff walked by. Eventually, our waiter grabbed the pizza and delivered it. The pizza itself was delicious and flavorful. The crust was crispy and fluffy at the same time. Soon after, the prime rib arrived. My husband enjoyed it; he ate every bite. I tried a few bites and it was good, but I thought the prime rib was missing something. More salt? More herbs? Not sure, but it was pretty plain. The mashed potatoes were well seasoned though.   When the check came, I inserted my giftcard and my credit card (just in case we went over the gift amount). When the check came back, I saw that the entire bill was charged to my CC. I had to alert the waiter and he apologized, saying he didn't see the giftcard and went back to un-charge my CC and apply the giftcard. He informed me I might see a double transaction but it would clear in a few days and again apologized for the mix up.   Overall, I was very glad I had a giftcard so I could try Nook. I probably won't be back, since it isn't in my neighborhood. However, if you are in the neighborhood, check it out.",

You won't be disappointed!  Table ordered: simple side salads, easily dressed but attentional to detail was nice. Divola pizza was INSANE. We highly recommend!",

Also liked that it was on linguini and not mashed potatoes. I tried the peas in some kind of cream on friends dish and that was great too. Didn't actually try the chicken on it. We shared the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. The \"cake?\" was almost the texture of a scone. I'm used to cake, so it was different. After it soaked up some of the berries it was better. The addition of a basil flavor was over the top delicious!  The reason for 4 stars is our waiter was very serious, almost grumpy. We did manage to get a few smiles out of him towards the end of the meal. I believe the man who was the manager/owner? was very helpful when I described a flavored rum drink that I enjoy. Very nice man.  We came on a Wed. So not as busy. With the few booths and bar that was occupied I imagine it would get hard to communicate with your table mates. We asked to be moved down a couple booths.  Menu a bit pricey, however I will be back to try other dishes. The Poutine sounds yummy!",

I ordered the Calabrese pizza. This comes with mozzarella, Tallegio, Parmesan, caramelized onions, sausage, chilies, basil and olive oil. I loved it! I added prosciutto to it, but I think they forgot to put it on. =/  I always think it's really odd when pizza places don't have ranch. I always mention this because I love ranch w/ my pizza. & what do they serve with their salads then? Since they didn't have ranch, the owner brought us this creamy Gorgonzola sauce. I'm not sure what's in it, but ask them for it! He even offered to whip something else up if I didn't like it.   The best part besides the food was the owner always came out to make sure we had everything we needed and even introduced himself. I call that very good customer service. They would get a five star from me if they had ranch. Also, it was a bit hard to find, because all the signs in that shopping center are the same color so it blends in. The place was a bit small but cozy. Good for dinner with a friend or a date. They have a happy hour! I'll be back for that!",

    "text": "Nook is a small, upscale restaurant that offers salads, a range of Western entrees, and pizza. Vegetarian options are marked, and there are quite a few of them. The word hangry was written artfully on a chalkboard near my booth, with its dictionary definition chalked below. I imagine most people that come to Nook don't leave hangry; I certainly didn't.   My colleagues and I were fifteen minutes late to our reservation, but were seated quickly: first at the bar to wait for our booth, and then at the booth. 1/3 of the restaurant is table seating, 1/3 is bar seating, and 1/3 is booth seating; it's not a particularly large space. I'm fully committed to the \"eat every carbohydrate that your health-conscious peers shy away from\" diet in 2016: I ordered arancini, the caprese bruschetta, and the funghi pizza.   If you're like me and afraid of pronouncing words on menus, I encourage you to still order the aracini. The fried balls of risotto were delicious. The Nook arancini came playfully arranged: four on marinara and two on balsamic glaze.  The arancini reminded me of a trip I took to San Francisco on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 - I stopped for pizza while traveling with a friend after just having seen the Book of Mormon at the Orpheum. Like that time before, this arancini was memorable. Maybe I'll be saying, \"that time I was in Phoenix for work and wanted somewhere to eat pizza and talk about refrigerators\" in a future review to reference this arancini.    The caprese bruschetta was okay. The balsamic glaze was too viscous, and the tomatoes were a bit ho-hum.   The pizza was phenomenal. I'm a sucker for the smell of truffle oil, and the pizza tasted as good as it smelled. I am struggling to find the right words to describe the pizza. The folks that don't like arugula salad on thin crust, white sauce, mushroom pizza should probably not order the funghi pizza. But for me, this was the best pizza I had had in, call it, at least six months. Chopped judge Amanda Freitag calls pizza her deserted island food, a food that she could sustain herself with ad infinitum. I'm not quite at that level yet, but: This. Pizza. Hit. The. Spot. It's the kind of pizza I sheepishly ate as quickly as I could so I didn't have to share it with others. Sorry, friends.   The service was highly attentive. Nook is the kind of restaurant that gives you clean plates between appetizers and entrees, and replaces your fork instead of asking you if you want to keep it. Our server did forget to place my colleague's salmon order. Upon realizing it, he was more repentant than Peter after denying Christ the 3rd time. Sure, our server didn't go about weeping bitterly, but he offered a free dessert.   I would return if I were in Scottsdale. I had heard good things about Nook, and am happy to confirm that they were True.",

    "text": "I keep asking can I swear on Yelp?  We were on spring break in Scottsdale this past week and happened upon this place by accident, and what a great accident it was.  It's kind of kitschy and hipstery but a way cool vibe all around, custom cocktails with a seasonal menu.  While I enjoyed my pizza (great crust) it was my girls filets that stole the show...coming from a beef town (Chicago) their filets were some of the best steaks I've ever eaten...the giant fries and that cheesy red bell pepper shmear was to die for...they were cutting the meat with their forks for fu**s sake!  Go here now...I only wish I lived here so I could come back to try everything else on the menu.  5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "Meh is right. I usually mesh with Yelpers but have to agree to disagree on this one. We were excited by reviews but disappointed by experience.   STARTERS: Pretty sure I found the worst margarita in the world. Ever. It was bland and flavorless, literally like water. Hubs had the rhubarb drink and liked it. The fried olives were interesting but now that I've experienced will probably never need again. There was an abundance of olives but the bread and dip steal the show. Also had the bruchetta and pardon the 51% Italian in me for saying that SHORTRIBS do NOT belong on BRUCHETTA. It's called a sandwich and needs to be moved to that part of the menu.   ENTREES in our party included margharita flatbread and chicken marsala. I felt like neither was to write home about, just average, so-so meal.   DESSERT went with the pumpkin whoopee which had a lot going on on the plate: chai ice cream, pretty solid; pumpkin whoopee was good, but missed that certain something; with the highlight being a gingerbread something puree. Puree was a show stealer, rich in flavor but certainly not a standalone. Maybe serving it with shortbread cookies or something but way too much with everything else on that plate.   My recommendation: This is one nook and cranny you may not need to explore. Price doesn't align with product and I think they're trying too hard to be different. There are too many great options in Phx to pay a premium for mediocre. Move on friend, move on.",

The pasta crepe is amazing and wish to find a special place in my will for the chef who invented this dish.  When we don't want a whole meal, it is easy to fill up on pizza and appetizers. All tasty which makes it hard to choose!! The deserts are great. Save room for them. Get the ice cream.. Great!!! Currently they are not serving the \"Nooker-doodle\", (which is in my opinion the best and served with cinnamon ice cream.. Yum) but the Fruity Pebbles desert is amazingly good.

Nook is a super friendly neighborhood joint worth investigating at least once if you live in the area. Frank, the owner, was around several times to make sure our food and service was up to his level (and to recommend the egg on the poutine, which I'm glad he did!) The pizzas are yummy but not entirely original. With the advent of so many gourmet pizza restaurants these days, I fear the lack of invention of Nook will doom it, as it has many restaurants before it. My message to Frank: your food is solid, beer selection great (yea Anchor Steam!), prices are good, ambiance is lovely-Just give me some innovation to be excited about! Also, the poutine is a knock out. Thanks for the egg ;)",

We ordered The meat and cheese platter to start, it was all sooo good we were fighting over it.  we had both the Funghi pizzas white and red.  We definitely liked the red one better.  Nothing was wrong with the white one, maybe we just weren't big fans of seafood on pizza.  The owner took it off of our bill , we hadn't even eaten one piece of it .  The winner of the night was chicken Marsala .  So good it was everyone's favorite.     We loved the place.  It's not cheap, we will be back for happy hour for sure..",

    "text": "After reading all of the glowing reviews of Nook on Yelp, I decided I had to try it.  First of all, you might be caught offguard by the fact that it is in a strip mall, but don't let that bother you.  Once you're inside, you totally forget.  With a name like Nook, it is exactly what you would expect--a cozy little Nook of a place.  There's a bar, several booths along the wall, and a few tables in the back.  We sat in one of the booths and were very comfy.  My only complaint is that it is pretty hot in there, but that's due to the presence of the brick oven.  Although I hate being hot during a meal, I'm a little more understanding when I know the heat is coming from that oven.  However, I will say, that makes me wary about going there in the summer.  Moving on...  The service was very good.  They don't take reservations for parties fewer than 5, and my party was of 4.  My boyfriend and I got there early, though, to have a drink at the bar, and the hostess was nice enough to seat us without the rest of our party being there when the restaurant started to fill up.  We really appreciated that.  Now on to the food.  First, we all shared the shortrib bruschetta.  It was good but not as good as I was hoping for.  The pieces are very small, and, although the shortrib was flavorful, it just wasn't good enough to want it again.  Then our entrees came.  I had the Gamberetti y Funghi pizza.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  The type of mushroom on it was one that I'd never had before, and it didn't really resemble a normal mushroom to me.  Also the shrimp on it was not my favorite.  Otherwise, the pizza was great--good brick-oven crust, great cheese.  One friend got the Quattro Stagioni pizza and loved it, but I didn't try that b/c I'm not a fan of olives or artichokes.  My boyfriend had the pasta crepe, and it was so different and amazing!  I may have to get it next time.  My friend had the chicken marsala and, although I'm not usually a huge fan, it was fantastic.    All in all, I loved this place!  Next time I will just wear short sleeves and order a different pizza.",

    "text": "Awesome! I expected this to be your run-of-the-mill eatery, and I was pleasantly shocked. The pizza was traditional Italian and cooked perfectly. The spiced chicken dish was incredible. Crispy exterior with mouth-watering tender meat beneath, spiced to perfection. The charcuterie could probably use another meat or two for variety, but was otherwise bountiful. Great local and traditional beer selection. The seasonal ale I had was excellent. Attentive service and a hip atmosphere for a Friday night. I'll definitely be back.",

The aranchini could have used more sauce (maybe a dipping sauce). The chicken artichoke bruschetta was really tasty but a little on the soggy side. The chicken chopped salad was very good. Overall we were really happy with our dinner!",

Lemon ice cream, chocolate crumble and a shot of espresso - delightful!  I'm already planning our next meal there - I am thinking wood-fired pizza....  Nook, we will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "The service was absolutely outstanding. Water glasses always filled, server had great suggestions, friendly manager, space was interesting and a perfect noise level on a Friday night being that the restaurant itself is pretty narrow. There are a limited number of tables but at 7pm on a weekend we didn't wait for one.   We were both super hungry so we each ordered a pizza. Didn't get the chance to order an app because we had to catch a late movie but the salads sounded delicious and by how quickly my neighbor table had theirs I'm guessing it was yummy.   I had the funghi e porco with added SPICY soppressata which was highly recommended by my server and it was the best pizza I've ever had! Crust just right-- not too thin but bit doughy and a nice crispness to it (they have a brick oven at the front of the joint) didn't skimp on ingredients either  boyfriend had the florentine pizza and had it with a red based sauce also at the recommendation of our server. Absolutely incredible and not too heavy. Ricotta really made it over the top for me.  Wine was delicious and fairly priced as well.   Oh and the ladies room had a delicious smelling liquid soap and a sea salt scrub that is available for purchase. SWEET! Apparently the men's room had neither though.   We left with full bellies and will definitely be back within the month it was THAT GOOD.  This place is going to get popular QUICKLY but these guys deserve it!",

We started out by trying some of their craft cocktails - make sure you get the Rosemary's Baby! It's a different and refreshing take on a margarita, with rosemary and red bell pepper. Seriously delicious.  We also each enjoyed our own pizzas (i'm vegetarian, he is not) and we both loved our selections. The pizza, along with the caprese bruschetta, made for a delicious dinner.  However, my favorite part of the meal was our desserts. Starting out with their Cacao Americano cocktail, I thoroughly enjoyed their delicious take on strawberry shortcake. Strawberries, lemon cookies, basil ice cream - to die for! This is a must have for anyone who wants to try something a little different, but a lot delicious!",

My friend and I shared the Mushroom and Sausage Pizza and the Chicken Chopped Salad. The crust, mushrooms and sausage on the pizza were excellent. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the red sauce. It needed more development, it tasted a bit like tomato paste out of the can.   The chicken in the salad was grilled and in nice, small, easy-to-eat pieces. The dressing was a bit watered down and lacking in flavor.   All in all, it seemed like Nook just needs a little bit of fine-tuning but has great potential. I would definitely be willing to give it another go, mainly based on the excellent service.",

My friend & I shared some appetizers & bruschetta, & it was exactly the right amount. My one little negative comment is the staff wasn't particularly welcoming or warm. Our waiter was efficient but not personable. Seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe it was because they had just opened for the evening & we were some of the first guests. No one was rude or bad at their jobs, just felt like it didn't matter if we were there or not.",

It's was fresh & well put together which was expected for the $7 cost. We had also ordered the prosciutto pizza which also came out in a timely manner. It was just crispy, light and topped with fresh arugula. Great job Nook!

    "text": "After dining here on four separate occasions, my feelings on Nook are somewhat mixed - which I guess makes me kind of the odd one out here.  The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is very hip and relaxed. I like the big booths, provided you're lucky enough to get one. As another reviewer pointed out, it's difficult to recommend items, because their online menu is outdated. What you see on their website isn't necessarily what they might be currently offering.  I really like their fig bruschetta, which consists of fig paste, prosciutto di parma, goat cheese, and asparagus. We've had some pretty dull bruschettas recently and this was clearly the way that it should be done.   As for pizzas, we've tried several, with the margherita, calabrese, and diavolo being the most notable. Their margherita was kind of unusual, looking and tasting more like a traditional cheese pizza based on how it was made (see pics). The calabrese and diavolo were both fairly decent representations. Overall, the pizza was acceptable, albeit more on the drier and \"flourery\" side than what we're accustomed to. I wouldn't quite put it in the same league as the bigger names in Phoenix. They do offer up a decently flavored crust, however.  Their best offering, however, is their nookerdoodle dessert. Think snickerdoodle and ice cream combined and you'll have a general idea of what it's like. Although it apparently disappears and reappears from the menu at unpredictable times, so you might get stuck with an affogato or peanut butter pie - not that there's anything wrong with that.   Some other notable mentions include the poutine french fries with a fried egg added. I'd never had fries drenched in gravy before, but the combination actually works. Be warned that the portion is extremely large and will fill you up fairly quickly if you're not careful. Half-order is an option if needed.  We were pretty disappointed in the bolognese in comparison to some of the other places we've had it. The sauce itself didn't seem as complex as the menu described, despite a slight spice. One whole lot of meat sauce and not enough pasta, although once again, the portion was pretty generous. I saw some pictures where it looked much better than the one we received. We were also a bit underwhelmed with the flavor of their filet when we decided to give it a try. On a more recent visit, we really liked their chicken marsala, which includes some exceptionally great mushrooms. It's truly just hits and misses all around with Nook.  I guess we might return eventually, as they still have many interesting things on the menu that might be worth experimenting with. I do feel that their prices are a bit pompous, however. Even if you don't drink, two people can easily run up a pretty big bill. I have no issue with this, but the food here isn't really superior to what you'd get at alternative \"modern Italian\" restaurants.  With so many hits and misses, my feelings will remain mixed and I can't bring myself to give them anymore than a solid three stars.",

First off, we showed up about an hour before they closed. I'm super biased cuz I'm not a huge fan of the Camelback Hipsters, but with glowing reviews, we gave it a shot.  The Brussels sprouts were great...the \"aoili\" not so much. Too hipster, too watery, too sweet, too not aoili at all.  I believe I got the braised short rib (writing this a few weeks later and obviously, the meal wasn't memorable, but the lack-luster service was). Mostly I remember our waiter talking with his friends more than waiting on us. The short rib was SUPER dry. It had been in the oven all day apparently. The mashed potatoes were good. The best part was the demi sauce. I would DRINK it.  My bf got this pork chop that was weird. It clashed. Too many flavors, not enough direction.",

Perfect amount of heat and flavor combination.  The best part of the whole experience was the hands-on service and attention given by the two owner/ manager/ bartender.  Finally someone who gets that True customer service and great dining experiences do not rely on one role per person.

The salad was decent but the pizza was absolutely mouth watering! I would highly recommend this place but be sure to make reservations. When 6:30 rolled around the place had a pretty large wait.

You can get some great prices on wines and beers on tap. The dinner menu is fantastic as well. Not as extensive as some other places like this, but it'st the quality, not the quantity. My friend had the filet mignon, and I had the scallops. The food was cooked perfectly and we had wine to go with our meal.

Don't get me wrong, Nook looks great. Nice, comfy booths, brick walls, TVs behind the bar. It reeks of a high-class neighborhood joint, which I imagine was the intention.  The problem is, it took my party of three 75 minutes to be seated. After we were quoted 30 minutes. Once inside it took another 45 minutes to get our food. Mind you, it was Friday night and the place was swamped. That's a whole lot of waiting around though.   Once we got our food, no one was really that impressed. I had the hummus bruschetta, which while tasty, was a few dollops of ingredients on the tiniest pieces of toast ever. I didn't mind too much, because by that time I wasn't even hungry anymore, but it wasn't quite worth the price.   Will I go back in the future? Sure, for lunch. I'd really like to like this place, and given the other reviews it sounds like we were there on an off night. I think I'll stick to the pizza though, and lower my expectations.",

The balls come on top of some wonderful marinara and a balsamic sauce. The poutine I did not LOVE, but it was a huge portion and was good....just got soggy in areas. The pizza was very good.

    "text": "Food Quality--5 stars Pricing/HH Options---3 stars  Well, this place was a very welcome surprise!  Nook has been on my list of \"must try' places and I finally got there to try it last night.  We got there about 4:30 to take advantage of HH specials and got seated immediately in a cute little alcove just off the entrance.  We sat in some really comfy little club chairs and my dining buddy was in heaven because we had arms on them!  I was in heaven because the place smelled so darned good :).    We had several things recommended to us but there were a couple of special items that caught our eye at the same time: poutine and arancini.  We ordered those and had some lovely beverages while we waited.  DB had some wine and it was pronounced delicious.  I was more in the mood for something fruity and cool, so got a grapefruit/vodka concoction that was really yummy.    The arancini was the best I've ever had...I've only had it 3 times so am by no means any expert.  The sauce and consistency was really nice and we scarfed them up in no time.   The poutine was the star of the show though; again I'm no expert but was just amazed by the gravy and fries(double fried makes a difference!!!).  The addition of a fried egg was sheer genius!..  We noshed leisurely and had a couple more beverages AND dessert!  Tracy Dempsey bread pudding!!!  I love it but don't have it very often---it was heavenly and worth the calories.  We also got to meet the chef and he was very sharp, sharing some of his future ideas with us.    So, how to get the coveted 5th star?    A better array of selections for HH would be great.  My drinks were pricey so I can't come as often as I'd like.  Maybe a drink special of the week?  I loved the HH specials we had but there weren't as many selections as I'd like to see.  With a chef of this caliber, maybe testing some things out as appetizers would be great.  Try different spins on the poutine.  THAT is your moneymaker!!!  A breakfast poutine, a southern poutine, a hatch chili poutine, it's ALL good.  (This will move you away from strictly Italian inspired, into the Comfort food category which opens a lot of new doors).  Think about adding to the salad selections (perhaps a salad pizza?).  The selections seem kind of pedestrian and new creations will really help business during the summer.  Speaking of pizza, BREAKFAST pizza would be a winner,  Egg, gravy, sausage.  Oh, yeah!  When we left, I was drunk on great food and delicious grapefruit beverages.  When the bill came, I paid and left a good tip.  I am still thinking about you, Nook, and plan to come back!",

Having worked in restaurants I am relatively critical of the service and we were extremely well taken care of from start to finish.   The food was awesome. The first words that come to mind are Italian Chic. Great conversation food and the pizza oven behind the bar adds a cool element to the place. The pulled pork bruschetta were tasty but small. Loved the charcuterie, great assortment of meats cheese and nomz. The pizza was rustic and as good as Bianco, Cibo, or Federal which are a few of my favorites in this town.   Check out this hot new spot. You won't be disappointed.",

He also came by on his way out to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction! Our server was equally attentive and made excellent recommendations. I can't say enough about the service. We also mentioned that it was our anniversary and were surprised with a free dessert! For dinner, we ordered a salad, pizza and three types of bruschetta: short rib, braised pork, and fig. The salad was not particularly spectacular, but the bruschetta and the pizza were wonderful and inventive. We will be returning often.",

I love the bar scene at Nook since I always appreciate the nostalgia.  I guess I wish I can be a time traveler is what I'm saying!  Anyways, my friends and I stopped by on a slower night and got right to our drinks.  My friend ordered an Old Fashion and asked for a less sweeter side of it; needless to say it came in sweet.    As for our food, we started with the Arancini.  I thought the marinara and balsamic was rather moot since this risotto ball was hitting my palates with love; crunchy crust with a warm creamy core texture and a cheesy sweet ending.  For my entree I went for their Proscuitto pizza.  Overall, warm doughy crust topped with arugula and proscuitto and cheese.  Simple, but got to the point and probably star entree of the table.  My friend ordered the Chicken Marsala and I had a bite; sweet and the pasta was well cooked and starchy.  My other friends ordered their short rib and short rib bruschetta.  I didn't care much for the short ribs anything since it seem like plain shredded meat.  The bruschetta didn't have much taste since it was literally meat on bread.    In the end, it was a hit or miss for me and my friends here.  I really really enjoyed their vibe and pizza so if anything I'll stop by for drinks next time I come around! - Enjoy!",

On my way back from Sedona with a lovely man, we called to see if they had a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday. Surprisingly enough, despite the little space, they did. I asked if they had any vegan options and he said \"salad\". I decided to asked if by chance they had pasta and he said \"of course, we can do something for you.\"  We get there and my date orders a nice scotch as an appetizer and a bottle of a wine neither of us had heard of. The waitress was very sweet to notice we wanted time to talk and was extremely accommodating to the vegan thing. She suggested the artichoke (which ended up being amazing) as she poured a glass of a delicious red wine.  Later she came back to say that she had asked the chef about a veggie pasta and he was ready to whip something up. My date decided on a spicy red pasta with shrimp.   We enjoyed our wine to the world poker tournament and it was brilliant...being at what felt like 5 star food and getting to watch the tournament (cup? Idk).   My date has roots in Sicily and said, \"you can tell the chef knows True Italian cuisine. This is incredible.\"   It made me so happy to have been the one to choose this place for our date. I'm embarassed of my prior review of calling them Mac n cheese balls when they're clearly arancini!   Overall, this was not only one of the best dates but also the best dinner. Thank you Nook.",

We had a big group so we had a lot of dishes, the notable ones were the fig bruschetta, prosciutto and fig jam, it has a good savory/sweet balance, goat cheese and large asparagus stalks. Brussel chips kind of reminded me of kale chips but had an amazing flavor, however they prepare them they are crisp. Maple aioli I could pass on for sure, it was good but I don't care for maple syrup in general...it was a mild taste but still had a sweetness to it. After the prosciutto I didn't think my body needed any more fatty meat so I split the Funghi pizza with a friend and it was very good, mozzarella, fontina, mushrooms, arugula and truffle oil. The server was really sweet and attentive though our bills were all over the place with different dishes on each others (I get it separate checks have to be a pain) we all just paid and exchanged cash back and forth.",

We came here during happy hour and indulged in a discounted appetizer and pizza. We had the poutine with egg, and the Giardino pizza.  The poutine was a heavenly concoction of mozzarella curds, gravy, and perfectly crisp fries. It was my favorite of the two items I had. The mozzarella curds were fresh and soft, with gravy that complimented the fries and cheese well. I liked how the gravy wasn't super salty which allowed for a better balance of flavors. The egg on top provided some extra creaminess and the runny yolk was great with the fries. During happy hour (Daily from 4-6 PM) this dish and other appetizers are $3 off.  The pizza had a thin crispy crust with a lot of fresh vegetables on top. I would have liked some more caramelized onion on it to balance out the rest of the savory flavors though.  Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.  I'd come back to try more appetizers during happy hour and also to see how their entrees are.",

Not loud, you can actually have a conversation at a normal level and not disturb anyone, but not overhear anyone.  Staff: 10 out of 10. Honestly could not be better. Our bar tender was fantastic. She remembered out names from the moment we met until 3 hours later when we left. She recommended an incredible Mexican chocolate peanut butter milk stout. Sound weird? It was rich and thick and smooth and delicious! Our server was amazing. He was incredibly knowledgeable about each menu dish, how it was made, each ingredient and what made it special, the taste balance, and spice. He made several recommendation and all were spot-on. He was attentive an friendly and relaxed. Other servers were as friendly and approachable and knowledgeable. They also stopped by, said hello, helped out with dish choices. Seriously amazing people.  Food: 10 out of 10. This is a very rare rating for me to give. The food was excellent in every sense. The blend of ingredients, spices and heat were incredible. Tastes were explosions of unique and unusual blends of high-end ingredients. Presentation was outstanding, colorful, modern, creative and beautiful. The quantity was plentiful. \"Beginnings\" were an excellent start, drinks were delicious, dessert was delicious and put us over the top. You will not leave hungry. Value was outstanding. For the quality, quantity, atmosphere and service, Nook cannot be beat.  Overall: I can't wait to go back. The drive from Ahwatukee was well worth twice the time. I am a huge fan of short ribs, wanted to try them, our server made an outstanding recommendation for the fried chicken which is no longer on the menu (hope it comes back) and the scallops. Both were phenomenal. Looking forward to going back soon to try all the other entrees.  Don't miss this comfortable, friendly, casual, delicious, plentiful, high quality place. Their menu changes, so go try what looks good, be amazed, then head back again to try something new and even more delicious. The friendly, attentive staff will always be glad to see you again.",

    "text": "We had driven past Nook Kitchen a lot not knowing what kind of food it was.  We've been to Beckett's Table and love the food there. My fiance decided that we were going to try Nooks.  In fairness, I hadn't read the reviews until after we had dined there.  We usually take turns trying out new places. First impression for me was -oh how cute!  It's cozy and inviting....sadly the feeling slowly changed throughout the course of our dining experience. The hostess was really nice and sat us right away and our waiter Ralph was extremely nice and helpful. We told Ralph that we hadn't been there before and asked for his recommendations. We started with the tongarashi popcorn and beef carpaccio.  The popcorn was fun it didn't want to fill up on it.  Though the carpaccio was good, it lacked a little acidity - a lemon wedge would have made the dish.  Here we go....  My fiance ordered the filet mignon (ordered as medium-rare) with red bell pepper polenta and asparagus.  The filet came burnt, the polenta was loose and the display of asparagus was just sad.    Me, I ordered the grilled salmon with parsnip puree, fingerling potato and haricot verts.  My salmon was cooked to almost perfection and the parsnip puree was very tasty.  The fingerling potatoes were a bit on the raw side and I almost choked on the haricot vert because the ends hadn't been trimmed.  My fiance advised Ralph of the over cooked filet (it came well-done).  Ralph was a little mortified since it was a dish he highly recommended.  He took it back to the kitchen and advised the chef.  When Ralph returned he told us that the chef advised him that's how the filet should have been because of the mushroom crust.  Ummmm...sorry no.   Ralph asked if my fiance wanted to order another filet or another dish.  He opted to order the chicken with tamarind mashed potato and a balsamic reduction and cipollini onions.  It was alright.  The chicken was slightly overcooked.  About 30 minutes later the GM came over to apologize for the filet and offered us a complimentary dessert.  We got the apple cake with ice cream.  Sadly the cake was very disappointing.  It was super dense and not even the ice cream could help it.  Maybe they had an off night, maybe we had an off dining experience.  But the sheer fact that the chef never took the time to come and chat with us..well that was a deal breaker.  Needless to say, we more than likely will not be returning to Nook Kitchen.  For the experience and the final bill, I would have rather gone to Beckett's Table as I know that Chef Justin cares about what he puts out.",

Some of their entrees are kind of on the pricey side, but they do have good deals for happy hour so I would try to get there in time for that if you can.   Our waiter recommended the Short Rib Bruschetta, and I'm glad he did because it was really good! They definitely make very good short ribs and the bread they use for bruschetta is very tasty. For dinner we had the Diavolo Pizza (depending on what you like, this one is more saucy and light on the cheese) and Chicken Marsala, both of which were very delicious! They also serve big portions so you should have plenty to take for leftovers.   As of this week, their seasonal tap is the Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Milk Stout, which I would highly recommend trying if it's still there. It literally tastes like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup :) I'll definitely be going back to this spot!",

Glad we ordered the app because the pizzas took a full 35 MORE minutes to come out after we got the app. It looked like they must have had a bunch of takeout orders, clogging up the pizza production. We were in no hurry but this could definitely be considered slow service, especially since the restaurant was not full. The food was tasty, but I'd say this place is just above average.",

The staff is so accommodating to their guests. If they can do it for you, they will. No hesitation. They are friendly and genuine.   The food. So yummy. And consistent! You know what you're getting every time. The pizza is so delicious and cooked right in front of you and then in their pizza oven behind the bar. I think they have one of the best charcuterie boards in the area at such a good price. Chef Nick makes some soups that are so good I've ordered them twice in one sitting. The desserts I could eat every day of the week for every meal.   The decor is trendy, but current is a better word. It doesn't come off as pretentious or overdone. It's neighborhood cute but romantic at the same time. Something I would expect to find hidden in an alley in Seattle or something. I love the music choices.   Overall a place to not pass up if you're in Arcadia.",

The nookerdoodle dessert was delicious and we had absolutely no problem finishing that off-- however, I do hope the pastry team may have had a bad day because there was hardly any shortening or compound ingredient in the tart of the dessert. It fell apart as though it was dry, rather than crumble as a tart should. A little too grainy because the coarse sugar did not melt into the crust.  Also, wishful thinking... Serve in a bowl or pasta plate ? It was so hard to eat ice cream etc on a plate !",

    "text": "Eh. It seems like we had an uncharacteristic bad experience at Nook, but I figured I would share.   All in all, I would say if it's not happy hour, this place is pretty overpriced. We decided to do a little VDay pregame at Nook. Grab some drinks, a couple of apps and after some research it looked like this was a perfect choice as they did Happy Hour every day! Sweet. WRONG! Apparently there is no happy hour on Valentine's Day. Bummer dude.   Oh well, we thought, I'm sure it'll still be fun. We each ordered a beer, and started looking at our food options. Everything looked delicious, so we asked our waiter. He said the Beer Braised Pork Butt and the Arancini. We went with it. After letting our waiter know that was all we were having, his demeanor noticeably changed. It was 3:30 on Valentine's. We weren't looking for dinner! Just a little stomach love in the afternoon. From that moment forward though our waiter, who initially seemed so cool, so hip, so human, became a heartless robot. Was he there, doing what he was supposed to? Certainly. But he was also made of metal and circuit boards and became incapable of feeling or showing affection.   On to the next chapter in our saga: the food. The food came out quick, was set on the table, and we immediately looked at each other. That's it? 6 little cheesy balls and 4 pieces of bruschetta. The cheese balls were the size of ping pong balls, and the bruschetta was averaged size bruschetta: hot wheel car size. Was the food delicious? Heck yeah! Was the portion sized for ants? Probably. It was appetizers, but dang give us a little love.   This brings us to the final chapter: the bill. After Mr. Jetson Waiter brought us our check, I almost let out an audible noise. $39. We had 2 beers, 6 cheese balls, and 4 bruschetta bites. $39. Seemed a little steep. No no no, seemed incredibly steep. Like I just got pick pocketed steep. We left wondering if it was a bad dream. It wasn't. So we went home and made grilled cheeses to warm our hearts back up.   Nook is trendy and cool. But dang it's pricey for what you get. Maybe I live on a different value scale, but I would say go somewhere different or go on happy hour. (But not on Valentine's Day; there's no happy hour then)",

However last night we went and for the first time we had another server, Ralph Taylor is the name on the ticket.  He was not bad, but not personable, and gave us every impression he wanted us to move on so he could turn the table as fast as possible. Maybe because we do not drink, not sure, but even before we were offered dessert he was asking us if we were ready for the check. I had to say \"No, my son would like to have dessert please.\" He said \"Oh, okay\", then proceeded to get my son's dessert and drop the check at the same time before we even finished the entire meal. No offer for coffee, nothing.  Don't get me wrong, the service was fine in terms of speed and attention, but I do not like to feel rushed throughout the meal as that is not right when you spend $120 on two pizzas and two main dishes, plus a nice tip for the pushy dude.  In all o four previous experiences we were waited on by Ale and she is the one to go with as she has a great personality, takes care of us with great friendly service, and always makes us feel welcome. I am sorry I did not specify her when we made the reservation, but unfortunately I did not remember her name until we saw her last night after we finished our meal. Next time we will go with Ale and all will be good. Sorry, Ralph....you need to be a little more respectful of your tables. We are not herded cattle, but those that pay your wages, and we do deserve to be left in peace without being scurried out to make room for the next group that may or may not spend more $ on drinks and other higher ticket items. Food is awesome, and we love this place, just won't sit with Ralph again, prefer to go elsewhere if Ale is not available....my wife and kids agree by the way so we are all on board with last night's slight disappointment.",

Went here for a business dinner and we were all extremely pleased and happy with the food!  We ordered everything from the poutine to several of the pizzas.  Just a couple times the service was not 100%, but pretty close.  We found the menu was decently priced, what you'd expect for fresh food.    The atmosphere in here is very appealing; I love the coziness and rustic-ness of the place. Very relaxing.  While waiting for our party to arrive, we went early to catch the Happy Hour which was good as well. Bartender was very attentive.  We will be back!",

Unfortunately, on my visit the service was deplorable. The server was slow and inattentive; granted it was a busy holiday, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but the straw that broke the camel's back is they charged me $70 instead of the $40 I was suppose to be charged. I waited for the server, he went to the register, and when he came back he said the difference had been refunded. Reluctantly, I took his work for it. I tried to call the next day, seeing as their location is not close to my house, but no one was willing to help. I still have not been refunded, and I'm sure I never will. Based on the other Yelp reviews my experience might have been a one off, but as a result I will not be returning.",

I'm still eating healthy- Tito's (vodka & tonic) has the lowest calories and carb if you're going to have a drink. No, really.  What? This short rib bruschetta right in front of me full of delicate port reduction on top of a bed of mushroom puree?  Well, I'm getting my protein in. And the fried risotto rice ball that's rich and creamy with just the right hint of mozzarella in the center?  The waitress told the they were one calorie each.  What?  I'm not hoarding my chunks of blue cheese and dipping them in my hard to resist blue cheese dressing. Hey, keep your fingers away from them! That's how it goes sometimes, I go in to eat a simple meal and the menu looks so delectable that I have to just \"order a few more\" just for tasting.  Good thing I had a few of my Elite Yelper friends with me to *sigh* share in the burden of tasting as we were in there celebrating Irene V.'s ROTD. And good thing as we ordered our way through the HH menu, the portions are the same as during regular hours but at about half the price cause I think by the time we were done, we might have ordered one of each item!

I even had mine without cheese, I can only imagine what it would taste like with cheese and a normal crust!!! It makes me so jealous!!! Jaja!   No for real though, my pizza was truly, truly one of the best I've had in long time and I'm counting the days to go back! I had the one with artichoke hearts, (I can't remember the name) it was actually supposed to have 4 cheeses on in it, and as I mentioned already, I had the cheese removed and added sausage....let me tell you, it was heaven on earth! I got my pizza fix for at least a year! Fortunately I won't have to wait that long to go back, teehee.  Besides the insane pizza flavors, on Sundays you can get any bottle of wine for half off...that's right, ANY BOTTLE half off..... So, my friend and I split an $80 bottle for 40, which means we each paid 20 for a bottle we would never buy otherwise! Well, I think it was a sweet deal...was it worth it? YES.   Service was suuuuuper friendly and helpful, from the Maitre'D to our waiter, everyone was eager for us to enjoy our experience.  Can NOT wait for next time!!",

    "text": "Before reading any further. This restaurant warrants a second try. The food was great and service was attentive. I was soured by the experience by one pretty big misstep, that I truly believe happens once in a blue moon.  The restaurant itself is tucked away in the middle of a strip mall in the heart of Arcadia. It's one of the many restaurants in the area that are easy to dismiss or drive by altogether without stopping inside. Once inside though, it exudes personality. It's designed as if it's an Italian wine bar - A nice concept and well executed. It would be an excellent choice as a date night.  I had the chance to try both the Chicken Marsala and the Pasta Crepe dishes, both of which the waiter recommended as the best dishes on the menu. The Crepe was described as basically a pan-fried patty of pasta. The chicken was then layered on top of the pasta. It tasted great, if only slightly under-salted. The Chicken Marsala was terrific, had it been cooked. I tasted the pasta first, which was perfectly al-dente, but upon cutting in to the chicken, the center was raw. The staff was extremely apologetic - Both the server and the chef came over to apologize, which was nice. Once the replacement came out, I've got to say that the dish still managed to pass my expectations. If only they got it right on the first try!  Nook would have straight-up gotten a 4 star rating had they fully cooked the chicken. I was a little disappointing that they knocked off a beer instead of comping the Marasala. Either way, the service and food turned out to be great. Definitely worth a second try.",

The darling hostess told us when there was a table available and she just needed to clean it which was a nice heads up. We got a nice booth, great atmosphere etc... our server Nicholas came over promptly and got us a bottle of Sardo (delicious)  and the grilled artichoke and hummus platter. This is where the lost 5th star comes in. The hummus plate is served with 2 scoops of hummus, garlic oil, tzaziki, fried garbanzo beans,  carrots, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers and 4 strips of bread. Like 1 piece in 4 strips. They charge of you ask for 4 more skinny little strips. (which we did twice). There was just so much to dip, but no bread. Bread doesnt cost that much, serve a basket with that particular app. To charge $1 is almost insulting, like neither of us, the owner nor me and my friends could afford it. The artichoke was still a bit hard but tasty nonetheless. Lemon aioli was spot on. Not too lemony. Now...the pizza was fantastic. Nice crunch to chewy dough ratio. We got a Divola (sp) with spicy soprassata and a red sauce and a white pizza with fontina and sausage on it. Both were just divine!! We all loved them so much. For dessert, we had a fruity pebble cake thing. Not the best thing I've ever had but certainly not the worst. The overall experience was great. We had good company, great food and wonderful service. Thanks guys, we'll for sure be back!",

The staff were welcoming and relaxed as they displayed their knowledge of the menu as well as the pairings. Our food was presented to us which is quite refreshing since so many places simple \"serve\".  Appealing to the eye as well as the palette is why this hidden gem gets 5 stars.

The food here is so delicious we can't wait to come back. We started with the pork butt, arancini balls, hummus and poutine.  WOW.. WOW...WOW.. We eat out often with our club and I think this was the best restaurant we've eaten at within the past 12 months.  We moved on to the highly recommended Filet, Pork Chops, Chicken Marsala and several pizzas. Everything was mouthwatering, fresh and well balanced.  The steak was melt in your mouth, and the marsala was one of the best we've had.  Pork chops were also outstanding moist, flavorful and delicious.  The chef came out and we had to give him the kudos that he clearly has earned.  This isn't just a restaurant, it's truly  an experience.  If you love great food, and really really good people this will become your favorite new restaurant. I know that it's mine... Wait..I forgot the desserts...they were AMAZING.. there was an apple dessert (super tasty) but the star of the show was the pot of chocolate with delicious cream and then espresso poured on top.. Seriously... YES it is that GOOD!!! Happy hour was great, food was superb and the service is more than top notch.... Ralph was helpful, courteous and spot on with recommendations.

Dishwasher drops a towel on the floor mat and unknowingly steps on it. A server notices the towel which has been there for a couple of minutes, and picked it up, placing it on the counter of the wait station. Another server unwittingly begins to clean the wait station with said towel. Once finished the server places said towel near the silverware tubs. Moments later the server proceeds to polish all of the silverware with said towel. All this took place while the owner was completely oblivious and engrossed in whatever was occurring on his smartphone at the time. Really sad because the food is always good here; the chef is very focused and turns out great quality. Think I'll have to wait until this cycle of silverware is done, before returning",

I also like the vibe, which has the casual feel of your favorite neighborhood bar, but with exquisite food that you have never tasted at any bar.

Outstanding menu but beware, it changes and online menu not in synch with what's in the restaurant (which had changed from a prior printed menu). Food was of high quality and well-prepared. Service was attentive if not a little doting. Live entertainment during our week night visit. Would definitely try again and wish I lived closer. Try the humus bruschetta, was amazing.",

The Diavolo pizza is ahhhmazing (perfect spice, great tasting thin crust right from the wood fired oven), and they have Poutine (fries with gravy and cheese on them)!  I'm Canadian and you don't see poutine on any menu down here very often. It's not your legit Quebec poutine (the Nook uses crumbled cheese instead of cheese curds), but it is tasty and satisfies my craving for sure!   Last time we were in Nick was our server and he was fantastic...very funny and very attentive. Oh and they even have happy hour on Sunday! $5 glasses of wine, $2 off cocktails and cheaper appetizers. We love this neighborhood spot, it has charm and a great atmosphere ...check it out!",

The sauce had a hint of sweet which I love and was packed with toppings. Friends ordered halibut tacos and linguini and clams - both loved their meal.   We split the strawberry basil shortcake and the snicker doodle dessert. The strawberry dessert was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was such an amazing combination of flavors. Very unique and the plating was beautiful.  The snicker doodle was our fave.  The server was attentive and helpful for first timers. He was patient with us gabbing gals.   The atmosphere was intimate and comfortable. The exposed brick, wall made of wood with candles,  beautiful lighting, and rolled silverware in fancy fabric napkins set the ambience.  Really a great restaurant for a date night or just a dinner with some close friends. Highly recommended!",

The menu was small but had a lot of good options to choose from. We started off with the Arancini appetizer, which I must say was the star of the night. The risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella had a great flavor to it especially with the balsamic reduction sauce that came with it. We then decided to share the Arugula salad which in my mind lacked any flavor to it. I felt it was way underdressed and salted. After the salad we both shared the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was nice and tender, but I felt that once again the whole meal itself lacked any impacting flavor (salt,garlic,....)  Maybe my taste buds require more salt then the average foodie but salt = flavor in my mind along with butter, oil, garlic.......etc. Since we shared everything starting with the app, we decided to get a dessert. We both shared the Bread and Butter Bread Pudding, which was good with no complaints. The question I ask myself after this meal would be would I come back here? The answer is yes, but only for a drink and the Arancini appetizer.",

Gritty, yet artfully decorated, narrow, long and lit for an intimate conversation. The food and wine sampled was impeccable and I'm eager to visit again. With a bigger appetite tho!  This place had the perfect date/romance ambience feeling in full effect. Sound is perfectly carried upward. Even with limited amounts of seating, conversation feels private and not shared with a neighboring table.  Note: You may very well be sampling something from the drink menu while waiting for a table. We were seated immediately (Wed ~7:30pm). However, I think we just happened to have great timing. The restaurant was buzzing with energy and filled almost to capacity after we were seated.   The bar stretches nearly the length of the restaurant. There are two televisions.  My partner in crime is a foodie and knows a substantial amount about wine. We were both equally pleased with our red wine selections. The cocktail menu looked interesting as well. (They have a drink called \"The Closing Argument\" which made me laugh. It's too bad I'm no longer dating a lawyer to test that one out;)  After lazily enjoying our wine we finally looked at the food menu. Our server was present, checking on us but never urging us out the door to make a decision. With great difficulty we picked the \"Calabrese\" from the Pizza Bianco menu.  Hoh. Geez. Mozzarella, Taleggio, Caramelized Onions, Sweet Sausage, Calabrian Chilis, EVOO & Basil.  There was no need to have accepted the offer for crushed red peppers on the side. The pizza was mouth watering and is just so difficult to describe. The sausage and the chili had the right amount of kick. When partnered with the cheese (Hoh. My) and caramelized onions. Well, amazing things happened in my mouth.  This place is a definite must.   Must try.  Must go. Must go again.  Yeah, that good.  UPDATE: Dude, you have to try the Chicken Marsala. Seriously. Someone at my table did and was fawning over it. I thought he had to be crazier than normal.   \"Oh. NO. Seriously. It's so soft. I was able to cut into it using the back of my butter knife.\"  Whatever. Then I fork sampled. LIKE FIVE TIMES. This was a situation where licking a plate would have been appropriate. You know. because THAT can happen.   (I was sadly only able to fork sample 5x's as I was daft and waited too long. Pity the fool that makes this mistake!)  I'm going back again and ordering this plate solo. Don't come with me, I'm not sharing. We may be friends ... but NOT at the table ;)  The other item that looked ridonkulously yummy was the meat and cheese platter. We were told it was made to accompany wine. Well, have a look at my photo. It's big! For a gal, that's a generous serving.  GOOD STUFF HERE!  Also,  I forgot. They have wifi here. Ask for the password! You'll laugh when they give it to you :)",

It comes with veggies, candied cashews (), and dried apricots with a lemon dressing. VERY tasty. To follow, we ordered a Gluten-Free Diavolo (Spicy Salami) pizza to share. We nearly fought over the last piece. I highly recommend this little \"Nook\" in Arcadia. You're sure to love it.",

    "text": "I liked that when I asked for Iced Tea I received real iced tea and not a strange funky flavor one like many places give you. This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them.   I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.  I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.  My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.  I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good.   3.5 stars Rounded up for above average service.",

She was spot on with the drinks. I had wine and husband had beer that she recommended. Appetizer was the Arancini. We could have eaten that all night! We ordered the Porco E Funghi pizza which was a thin crust pizza that was cooked in their pizza oven. Again delicious. Dessert was the only miss. We ordered the Peanut Butter Crack Pie. Huge miss! Would have been much better if \"cookie\" was heated and not stone cold. With crunch being cold it was so hard that we nearly couldn't cut it.",

    "text": "Had a one night layover in Phoenix with my girlfriend on the way to Mexico, and I had a feeling we should spent that night looking for some good food. A quick browse around Yelp revealed this place to me, and I figured I'd go for it. Sending the owner Frank an email asking about reservations yielded positive results, and so when we had settled in to the hotel, we went to Nook.   I'm pretty happy we did. The restaurant is laid out differently than most, going for depth rather than width. The bar was perpendicular to the entrance, and there were booths all the way down following the wall opposite the bar. We sat in one of these booths, and our waiter attended to us immediately. He was very pleasant, and attentive, offering a few personal anecdotes here and there as the night went by and he passed us or cleared our table. We started with the Arancini and if you'd pardon my language, it was effing amazing. Just... amazing. I opted for a glass of white wine to go with dinner, and the girlfriend had a nice cocktail.   The entree was pizza and it was superb. The menu is concise but effective. We shared everything and it was awesome. The mood in Nook is definitely classy without feeling uptight. Laid back and stylish. People sitting in the bar seemed like people who knew the place intimately and it gave a familiar ambiance. Like you're just down on the corner from home. I liked it a lot.   We finished with an Affogato. It was, as expected, really good.   This place tickled my fancy in a big way. If I'm ever through Phoenix again, I'd have to fight myself hard not to go here again. Perhaps I would end up forgoing trying new things just because I want Frank and his crew to make my night once more.",

For the kind and quality of the food, and the overall much more casual experience than we expected, the price point seems a little high.The food is good (particularly the short ribs, but the salmon was dry, the swordfish lacked flavor, and sometimes the presentation was quite lacking), the service is excellent, and overall I think its a 3.5 star experience (I'll round up to 4 for Yelps sake).   It feels cosy and casual, even though it is pretty dimly lit, largely because of the TVs right next to the booth seating area. That's probably why it feels more like a sports bar than an intimate restaurant. Most of the other diners seem to be in their 30s-50s and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Let's just say there are a lot of tattoos and piercings in the room, which is totally fine with me but did not sit well with some of older, more traditional professionals I came here with. It feels more like a cool place to come with friends, than a place to have a fancy dinner with colleagues or family.",

I don't know how I felt about the artichoke, it was too tangy for me. The rest was satisfying!  Creamy gorgonzola sauce, and tapitio is a great mix for dipping sauce. Phenomenal!!!!!!

He manages dilly dally, and literally was walking back and forth the entire time! You wonder how in the hell he didn't noticed when he went in and out of the door at least 5 times back and forth.

We definitely needed something on the lighter side so had the Arugula salad.  It was nice and refreshing!.   No we couldn't eat everything as much as we tried!!   I'll be back there soon!",

Our waiter was clearly having a bad night and barely said 10 words to us the whole time we were there.  When we placed our drink order he did not say one word to any of us he just nodded his head.  Then after literally 20 mins (mind you he walked by us a dozen times or more) he came back to take our food order but he seriously just stood in front of our table and did not say anything so finally my husband goes \"I'll have the blah blah blah\" then we all proceeded to order and he just walked away.  He did eventually come by and offer my husband another beer but never brought it, the manager actually stopped by and offered my husband a beer and that one we got. He spent more time standing around talking to other people than he did to his customers.  I get it that people have bad nights but it's not that hard to put a smile on your face and just be polite.",

It certainly has great pizza among other things, but not close to quiet during our visit. The hostess was superb and \", in spite of the crush we got seats at the bar in about 10 minutes. A good wine list and a small draught selection, but beers you don't see everywhere.   We had one of those experiences a that shows what owners are made. We had a great fig bruschetta to start. We ordered one of their white pizzas. I noticed when theirs came out that the couple next to us got the same pizza we ordered. About 5 minutes later a pizza was presented to us that wasn't what we ordered. It quickly became clear we had been served the pizza those next to us had ordered. They had ours. The owners quickly offered us a round of drinks and ordered up another pie for us. After a couple of slices of the pizza they ordered, our new friend assured us we had made the better call. When our came after profuse apologies from the owner, we were very pleased with our selection. Fantastic pizza. Bianca with sweet sausage. Our next door neighbors offered to buy us ours but no need. Our free round of drinks cost more than the pie.   It isn't about the mistake, we all make them. It's about the recovery, and the Nook Kitchen owners did great. We'll be back. Great service and superb food. What more could you ask for.",

And their Chicken Marsala was as delectable as it gets, with balsamic mushrooms (and I don't even like mushrooms) that I couldn't get enough of!! Long, narrow dining hall with a bar that spans nearly the entire length, rustic modern decor, dim lighting for a romantic feel, just a nice gem tucked away. Oh I nearly forgot, the Sandia specialty cocktail made with Mezcal was something special indeed!",

Living and dining in the 85018 zip code area for the last few years has got us spoiled with all the great places to dine.  But what separates our experience from others was the TOTAL package:   Quality of food, knowledgeable wait staff (everyone) and ambiance.  They ticked all the boxes and now it's not if we go back, it's WHEN.  Ultimately, if you prefer 'mom and pop' establishments , where the owner is present, helpful, and does whatever it takes to make your experience memorable (even if it's just a $50 check) - you've found the place!  We were so impressed by their genuine desire to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  From cocktails,  to appetizers,  to dinner their suggestions were based on our answers to their questions.  They seemed like they were there to help and serve - and did a masterful job.  Highly recommend it!  It is now on our 'we will be a regular there' list...  Enjoy!",

The owner (also a sommelier) put together some small plates of charcuterie, fruits, and nuts and paired them with all different kinds of wine.   The service was great and the he did a phenomenal job explaining the most commonly used wino terms. He also taught us how to pick out some great wines and made awesome wine recommendations for the budget friendly wine drinker:)",

Plus the atmosphere is lovely and the service is excellent.  One foodie indication: the menu was absolutely perfect for the season.  The lightness and freshness of the tastes is just perfect for summer.  The halibut tacos were served with avocado and radishes in lettuce wraps - perfect!  The strawberry and basil shortcake was so incredibly refreshing and delicious (please order this, you won't be sorry!).  The Giardino pizza, though lovely in any season, was so incredibly aromatic that we couldn't wait to eat it!  And the bruschetta that we started with had halved cherry tomatoes instead of shopped ones - interesting as well as tasty.  Even the service was lovely and enthusiastic.  All this wonderful foodie food came in nice portions, and we had an appetizer, two dinners and a dessert for about $50.  We'd been wanting to try this place, but with all of the amazing gourmet pizza in Phoenix/Scottsdale, it took a while.  We're so glad we did!!",

I think they used a wet towel clean the table and the booth and forgot to wipe them with a dry towel. My friend mentioned it to the hostess and she didn't do anything and just walked away. We used the napkins that were on the table and wiped it ourselves before we can sit. Other than that the service for the rest of the night was pretty good.   We were there for Happy Hour, so we ordered Poutine($5), Fig Bruschetta($7), and Caprese Bruschetta($5) from the HH menu. I love French fries so Poutine was a good choice it has gravy and sprinkled some mozzarella curds over the fries and topped with a fried egg ($2 extra). Fig Bruschetta top with thin slices of meat, a piece of asparagus and some goat cheese and the combination tasted so delicious. Caprese Bruschetta has halved cherry tomato and mozzarella cheese and it was so yummy. Another friend came later and join us she had the Porco e Funghi without mushroom. I was so full with my selections so I didn't try her pizza but she almost finish the whole thing I assume it was good.   I am still trying to search my wine selections and Nook gave me that option. They don't commit until you said you like it. Over all I had a great experience here. Will be back!!!",

    "text": "Met with Linda W. at Nook yesterday- it was both our first time there.  Sat at one of the circular half-booths that line the wall, at which one end terminates at a wine cellar and the other at the entrance.  The noise level was jarring at first, and made me wish we'd kept the initial offering of a booth closer to the entrance (less noisy), but after a few minutes' of adjustment, our central booth with a great view of the bar and kitchen just opposite was a nice choice.  There is a HUGE step up to get into the booth (about eight inches), so be careful as you step down.  I was wearing a mini-skirt and thought I could just slide off the seat onto the floor, but I forgot about all of that space...  When I come back to Nook, I won't be wearing a mini-skirt!  :)  Our server Alice was very personable and easily shared her faves when prompted.  I commented that she knew \"her stuff,\" and she quickly came back with \"except about the cornstarch,\" referring to the queries I had regarding certain menu items.  Now, onto our happy hour selections:  Linda ordered a $2 pint of Kronenbourg 1664, a pale lager made in Strasbourg, France.  It smelled fruity, which I welcomed, but it had enough of a hoppy flavor for me to dislike.  However, Linda liked it a lot.  She ordered the $5 Poutine, which consisted of house-cut fries, mozzarella curds, and beef gravy (made with cornstarch) and added a fried egg for an extra $2.  If you are part of a group of three or more, I suggest to get TWO fried eggs added!  We didn't have the problem of very soggy fries due to the beef gravy arriving in a separate bowl. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ#nz1KtnNBoqgYiwokAbqKKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  Her other selections were the $5 Caprese bruschetta, which I didn't try (I'm avoiding inflammatory foods, such as tomatoes), <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA#Ujg_pGder-78HkVW2ZYPTA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a> and the $5 Arancini, which were mozzarella and red pepper risotto balls, battered and fried, and placed on a bed of marinara sauce and balsamic drizzle.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A#LdcmR5wLzqm1eyno_g38_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  I said the heck with my rice allergy and tried one and found it mild and creamy, with a nice aroma from the red bell peppers.  Glad I tried it!  Since I didn't enjoy the Kronenbourg sample Alice brought me, I asked for a glass of the 10 Span Pinot noir, which was drier than I prefer, but paired alright with the Beer-braised pork butt bruschetta; That is, until I later sampled the 10 Span Pinot gris, which made for a heavenly match with said app.  The pulled pork came with a \"secret BBQ sauce,\" which was slightly sweet and more importantly, free of corn syrup and mustard, two ingredients that keep me from ordering anything that usually comes with BBQ sauce.  Wait till you take a bite of the pork and coleslaw... oh my goodness!  The sourness from the coleslaw cuts the sweetness of the sauce and makes the app so much fun to eat.  Better than foreplay, I tell ya!  ;) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg#xTAc8Lwz804Do8tdHQj9xg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  The $7 Fig bruschetta was very good, arriving with smoked prosciutto, goat cheese, and an asparagus spear, all sprinkled with herbs.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ#l9TYtf4Or2WEOr369_zJFQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  Order this if you want to keep it light, yet tasty.    The piece de resistance for me was the $8 Bread & butter bread pudding, which came with an apple-cranberry compote and caramel ice cream on top, a Tracey Dempsey creation. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA#GLY1jPWqO5mH9uSUIsAHsA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  The compote I could do without, as I found it to be too sour, but the caramel ice cream and warm bread pudding combo was orgasmic!  I even had a spoonful of cold bread pudding leftovers this morning and was still amazed by the flavor and textures.  The flavor was eggy, which made me think this could make for a great French toast (too bad Nook doesn't offer breakfast service), but what took this bread pudding over the top for me was the tres leches flavor of the custard.  I will most certainly order this dessert again!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nook-phoenix?select=ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw#ivZlqH9o6nDnSu7PC3U-zw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nook...</a>  Kudos to Nook for the delightful flavors and laid-back, yet sexy atmosphere, and to Alice for great service!",

The desserts that were featured online, on their website, were not on their menu when we arrived but instead three different ones entirely. We all went with the peanut butter crack pie and it was exactly as it sounds - DELICIOUS.   However, the reason for only giving this review a 3-star rating is because of the way we were approached and felt upon entering the restaurant. Immediately upon entering, the host (male w/medium cut hair) approached us and asked how many, we said six and he grabbed menus, rolled his eyes and then proceeded to walk us to our table. He then went to the bar to inform the waitress that her table was seated in which he rolled his eyes again and glared at us off and on for a good 10 minutes after we had been greeted by our waitress. I am not sure what his deal was, but it hindered the experience from being worthy of 5-stars. Our waitress was very accommodating, friendly and attentive to us, constantly refilling waters and making sure we were happy.   I can understand people having bad days, but if the first impression you give is not customer-service oriented, you will end up with more reviews like this and lose business, as there are plenty of equivalent restaurants forming in the area.",

Fighting the selfish need for food satisfaction I decided to venture out and tried the Chicken Marsala and I have to say it was totally on par with the Filet, I was not disappointed at all. The flavors here taste like the best home cooked meal and again like someone actually cares about the food. I've now had the Marsala several times and it's been amazing each time. So five stars for consistently impressing.   Last night I ventured out again and while I typically get the artichoke appetizer, I think it's seriously one of the best artichokes in town, sadly they were out. Again scared to be disappointed we reluctantly ordered the Arancini and the Wood Fired Olives. The Arancini was moist and the accompanying balsamic sauce was the brilliant and made the dish shine. They were devoured in about 2 minutes.   However, the HIGHLIGHT of my food adventure here has to be these damn olives. I am a fan a green olives but this is not a dish I would typically order just by reading it on the menu.  Green olives sauteed in olive oil in the wood oven with tiny bits of soppressata sausage.  They are served hot in the EVOO with a crostini to dip. I have never had olives prepared this way they were warm and tender and basically almost falling off the pit. The saltiness of the olives with the warm buttery goodness of the oil was melt in you mouth amazing. Simple and delicious.   EAT HERE, it's not fancy but the food will not disappoint. It's down home good. The pizza, my boyfriends staple, is also super delicious.",

The last one, we invited one of our friends who lives in the neighborhood to join us.  He was so pleased.  We started at happy hour, their HH deals are great.  I had the arancini, so delicious.  The risotto balls filled with mozzarella and then deep fried and with a reduction of balsamic on the plate, what is not to like.  Creamy inside and crunchy outside, did I mentioned they are deep fried?  We also had the Short Rib Bruschetta and the arugula salad.  Our friend arrived after HH so he ordered a salad that is not on the menu anymore :(, it was a deconstructed salad with salmon.  My hubby also had a pizza.  I wouldn't go there for pizza, since there are so many other places that do just pizza, but the rest of the items are amazing and don't miss the bread and butter bread pudding.  It is AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back.",

Nice thin crispy crust, but was also somewhat dry and too crunchy. The ingredients were slightly flavorful, some sweetness with the fruit paired up with saltiness from the sausage. Definitely not pizza I would return for unfortunately, but the ambiance and setting I would. Better then the pizza was our server, Ale! She was very helpful, very friendly, informative, and checked in with us at appropriate times. Very cozy spot woth an intimate feel.",

Wish they had been a bit hotter, but they were yummy. 6 to an order. We also got two types of meat on bruchetta. Those were tender, flavorful and delicious.  We ordered two pizzas. The waitress said they had 6 slices but came with 8, and we thought it was plenty for two people. The pizzas were delicious.  We sat at the community table. Very nice inside; lively atmosphere.

The rich sauce was a perfect compliment to perfectly cooked chicken and tender linguini. I'll be back. Oh, and my husband cleaned his plate as well. He had the Diavolo pizza.  The atmosphere was comfortable yet just upscale enough for date night. I can't fail to mention the service, which was top notch. Our server Nick took excellent care of us, and the owner made sure to stop and ask how everything was. I'm a fan.",

My boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday before he went out of town for a few weeks. When we got there the hostess gave us a 15-20 minute wait time since we hadn't called ahead. The wait list was a jumble of names scribbled at the bottom of a piece of paper so I was a little confused but we were the only ones standing around so I didn't give it too much thought. We loitered in the shopping center for a while talking. 20 minutes turned to 30 turned to 40 and the hostess assured us it would be just a few more minutes since we were next. Another 15 minutes later it would only be another few minutes. We finally gave up after wasting nearly an hour and went somewhere we could actually eat in a reasonable amount of time. The food looked great in pictures but if the rest of the restaurant is as disorganized as the hostess maybe it's a good thing we never got to actually sit down.",

This review receives less stars and it is partly my fault. I asked the pretty blonde girl behind the bar for a glass of Cabernet, and she poured me a taste and it was fine. So great that I had 2 glasses.  However when the bill came, little did I know they were $14 per glass. Again, partial my fault for not asking ahead of time, but I'm sure there are lesser wines on the menu and typically when you say \"I'll have a Cabernet\" you usually receive the house wine.  I'm sure I'll be back, but this visit left a bad taste",

    "text": "We stopped in after an early D'backs game and luckily they had a table for our group of four.  We were greeted promptly by our waiter.  He was tied up with a large table so the owner, Frank came over and took our drink orders.  I wasn't sure which sparkling wine to select and he brought me a sample of one.  It was a winner and our drinks were served quickly.  Frank even took our appetizer order.  When our waiter returned he knew what we had ordered and made some suggestions for dinner.  Even though the restaurant was packed everything was brought to us in a timely manner and was delicious. The fig bruschetti and humus appetizers were great and the pizzas are quite large.  We'll be back!!",

    "text": "So... run don't walk to this quaint local bar and eatery that has delicious food and a great happy hour.  I stumbled upon this urban and modern, but comfortable establishment Thursday, March 27th.  Ready for a drink and bite to eat, this place delivered that and more.  We started with a \"lite beer' Kronenbourg 1664 for um, $2.00-Yes, $2.00!  Moved on to the bruschetta (beer braised pork butt) and it was great, then we tried the Arancini (risotto balls) even better!  We were getting full but everyone was getting a pizza so we decided to try the Margherita pizza and it was heaven.  The chicken chopped salad was awesome as well.  Can't rave more about this place.  Please check them out... they will be adding outdoor seating by the summer and I can't wait to sit outside by the fountain and try some of their other menu items!  Our server Ralph was very informative and the owner stopped by to check on us as well.  What a great place... we'll be back-soon!",

Excellent wine selection and the feel of a cozy neighborhood joint round this out to being one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!",
