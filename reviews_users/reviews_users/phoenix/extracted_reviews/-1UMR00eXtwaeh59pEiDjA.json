    "text": "Let me start by saying I have been to the original Matt's location. I love the original Matt's location. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this one on a long layover in Phoenix. I was a little skeptical when I got closer. The walls are subway tile and there is a lot of orange and chrome, making it feel more like a diner than the funky downtown Matt's. Not only do they have breakfast all day, but they have a Ruben. A crazy good Ruben. Upgrade to the steak fries, you'll be glad you did!  The rye bread was buttery and toasty.  The corned beef was flavorful and tender. To top it off, my server Miguel was awesome. I travel for work, so I eat alone a lot. He was attentive without being intrusive. When you dine alone you tend to notice when service is slow or around too much. Miguel really had a knack for being there at the right time. Thanks for the great dinner. I will now have to schedule my trips with a long layover in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Not the best but not the worst.  I took a seat at the counter since there was a wait for a table and I was a party of one. Bartender/waitress flopped down a menu.  After perusing, I ordered The Hog and Chick, which was basic eggs, meat, potatoes and toast. I asked if I could pay extra to substitute a pancake for the toast.  Waitress gave me a dumbfounded look and said \"yeah, I guess but I don't know how to do that\".  That was the red flag I should have paid attention to. Then she asked, \"sausage, bacon, or ham?\" I picked ham.  Ordered a coffee that came in a tiny cup. They don't have cream, just milk.  Food arrived, decent in taste and usual presentation.  Pancake was small and average.  Here's the kicker...ticket showed pancake substitute was $5! For one pancake.  Ham was an extra $5! (which I just discovered should have only been an extra $1)Tiny coffee that I had to ask for a refill was $3.50. My ticket was $26 for a slightly better breakfast than Dennys! I didn't question it as the waitress didn't seem like one to mess with.   Entertainment was a super flamy and friendly waiter catering to his customers and giving much better service than I had and watching a line cook repeatedly digging out waffles that were stuck in the waffle iron and ripping in half. He used them anyway for the waffle orders to go. Too spendy for what I ordered, probably wouldn't recommend nor return.  The place should be called Matt's Big Ticket Breakfast. Boo.",

I had this gin, lemon and soda water drink which solved my pissy attitude towards the airport :).  For food I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon to the grilled cheese.  They had awesome buttery bread and the soup was nice and thick.  Every employee seemed like they were having a great day which helped as many of us were grumpy from canceled and delayed flight.  Prices were good so I strongly recommend!",

Server dripped coffee on my leather jacket; didn't seem too concerned, but did bring napkins after I already used the napkin on the rolled silverware to clean her mess. Table was ridiculously wobbly; there goes more coffee into the table. Good thing she brought clean-up napkins already.   - Food disappointing. Lemonade tasted like dirty dishwater; replaced with coke which tasted fine. Ruben sandwich was a let down. Grilled bread was not well grilled; more of a greasy, un-browned mess. Corned beef was a little scarce, especially for the price.   - Overall impression. I've heard good things about the MBB downtown but only had the patience to wait in line once in my life (my recollection was the breakfast was...ho hum). This was the first I've heard of MBB in the airport. It was generally disappointing and I wouldn't go back if I had other options. Also based on the Reuben, the place clearly shouldn't be called Matt's Big Lunch.... Final tip - there's a Wendy's two shops down.",

Nice decor that reminds you of Matt's downtown.  However, the food here is just not the same.  Scrambled eggs were dry and seemed like they had been cooked for a buffet.  Potatoes not as good as the original.  Toast was superior (they must have stayed with the same baker).  I saw so much food being thrown away (folks just weren't enjoying their breakfast).  Overall, I was disappointed.  I'll give Matt's another try next time I travel and hope the quality returns.  Come on Matt, get it together and serve quality breakfasts like you are known for.",

You saw she did not eat it and came right back with some lean, crispy pieces. She took my silverware :)  The gentlemen next to me asked for a drink which Matt's serves on ice which he is not used to. You quickly apologized and wanted to make it right.  Matt, you need to give her a raise to keep her on staff; folks like Jennifer are rare and you cannot afford to lose valuable employees like her.

The potatoes were undercooked and room temperature. The toast was room temperature and wouldn't even start to melt the butter that was put on it. They brought me a new batch of potatoes and new toast, which I appreciated. It seemed to me that the omelette was not freshly made. I've never tasted one like that before that was freshly made. From the way I was dressed it was obvious I worked at the airport and wasn't just passing through. I probably won't go there again.

The highlight was the swine, they make mean bacon strips!  Another plus was the side salsa they provided, much better than anything that comes out of a bottle.  I washed my burrito down with a cup of coffee.   The physical location is open air, bright and friendly.  They also have a big square bar which can seat around 20 people.  I found my way to the sit down counter, where my server was Kristie, she was friendly, but obviously busy.  I never say this, but I was completely satisfied with my bang for the buck!",

Even if I have to traipse the rest of the way around the terminal to my Southwest gate, it's worth it to me to get here early and have a delicious breakfast.  They have the best bacon for sure, and the staff has always been fast and friendly.  Maybe someday I'll try something else, but for me the hog and chick is the way to go.  Love everything about this breakfast from the bacon to the roasted potatoes to the homemade raspberry preserves on the fresh baked marble rye toast.    Delicious!",

The cheese was a new twist and it worked good it was a nice cheese. the olives were subpar as was the cucumber.( one cucumber looked old or once frozen and the other one was sooooo very salty and I love salt but couldn't eat this one..

She also kept a smile on her face with every customer encounter. The service definitely enhanced my dining experience. All the plates coming out of the kitchen looked delicious.

This seemed odd to me, so I clarified, receiving the same response without any explanation as to why this was the case. Seems odd to me they can sell only coffee with cream and sugar added. Based off of this, I can't recommend them for an early cup of joe at the airport.",

    "text": "Yes, I'm giving five stars to an airport restaurant. Here's why. My husband and I stumbled into Matt's after being stuck overnight in Phoenix, having missed a connection on our way home to CA. Without makeup, in day 2 clothes, and jet-lagged out of my mind, I just wanted to use our meal vouchers on something. Anything.  What we got was just wonderful. Fresh, delicious comfort food. I got a hearty breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon that came with a side of rosemary potatoes. My husband had a giant crispy waffle. My Bloody Mary came garnished with peppers, pickles, cheese cubes, celery, and a slice of bacon.  But what really pushed this review to 5 stars was our server, Michael. He greeted us with sincere warmth and good humor, and kept us laughing and smiling through our meal. Believe me, that was no easy feat based on my mood! He made great suggestions for food and drink, letting me sample the Bloody Mary mix from the drink I selected before ordering (I went with a different one based on his recommendation and I'm glad I did). And when our meal vouchers exceeded the tab, he used the extra to provide us with bottled water for our flight. Not sure when I'll be back in PHX, but I'll eat at Matt's for sure, and will hope for Michael as my server.",

Eggs came out slightly more 'easy' than 'medium', but was acceptable for me since I like it either way.  Sat at bar. Katie provided good service while working the bar. Checked back. Kept busy. Even made sure my water was refilled. Thanks Katie. (normally don't write reviews)",

I sat at the bar and saw at least ten plates ready for delivery in the kitchen while the staff just wandered about ignoring it. The only people that appeared mildly interested in working were the cooks and the bartender. That being said my egg and bacon bagel was of the quality typical of a hungover college student.

    "text": "Stopped by Matt's at Sky Harbor waiting for an evening flight.  I ordered the Sonrisa Burrito (no meat) which contains eggs, cheese, potato, & jalapeno.  Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? :) The waiter asked if I would prefer Avocado in lieu of the meat - so I bit and asked for it on the side.  I also requested extra jalapeno.    For an adult beverage, I ordered a double Tanqueray and soda water with lime.    The drink came out first.  Immediately I could tell two things: it wasn't Tanqueray in my glass, and the drink was definitely not a double (although it was in a tall glass.)  I mentioned the drink to my waiter, and he explained that a double is 2 ounces, not the customary 3.  I requested an additional double (neat) to test my theory.  Sure enough, it was not what I had ordered, it was well gin (brand unknown.)  I wont speculate as to why - draw your own conclusions.  All in, my premium double was $30, and it was not premium or drinkable.    On to the burrito:  in AZ (generally speaking) if you order jalapenos, the unspoken rule is that they will be fresh.  In this case, they were pickled nacho slices and missing all of the fresh jalapeno flavor.  The eggs were burnt to a crisp, and this is coming from a guy who does not specifically enjoy the classic runny yolk or French omelette.  They put the avocado in the burrito instead of on the side.  On top of being extremely overcooked, the eggs and potatoes were completely under-seasoned... no salt or pepper that I could taste.  The side of salsa was mediocre, but edible.    To sum it up: at Sky Harbor, find food and beverage elsewhere.  I left with a $50 tab (I did tip the waiter, as he was courteous and quick.) For $50 bucks, I had a few sips of a beverage I did not order and a few bites of a bad burrito.",

This one is at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport (we were waiting for a flight). If you are at the airport and need a meal, you can't go wrong here.   We ordered the waffles, and a \"Hog & Chick\" (Two eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes). Fresh OJ to boot. I enjoyed the Hog&chick but the waffles are a better choice. Overall, not the greatest breakfast I have ever had, but for an airport, it's decent.  I have heard that the other locations are better. When I am back in town, I will try them.",

Our bartender/waiter at the airport looked like he hated his life. Never smiled once and wouldn't make eye contact or speak at an audible level when he talked to you... it was actually kind of amusing to my husband and I.  The people sitting next to us were vocal about his poor manners/service, but we just wanted some bacon so we got over it and managed to laugh about it.  I got the Hog and Chick; the potatoes here were not as crispy here, but it's all the same locally sourced ingredients for sure.   (Seemed like it was a smaller kitchen but the restaurant had more seating than other locations, so maybe they were rushing the cook on the food? We waited about 30 minutes for our food from the time  we ordered.) Overall 3 out of 5 as the service had major issues, the dining room was crammed (my legs  and elbows were touching the stranger next to me), but the taste was just as good as the other locations.",

Their mimosa was pretty standard but it was actually fresh squeezed oranges which is a plus. But you know it's a mimosa so eh.   I had French toast and smoke sausage which the toast was amazing. The sausage however was so salty it wasn't even edible. So I left it.   The biggest flaw was that buzz me if you need a waitress button. It made the whole thing uncomfortable. At one point I wanted another mimosa but it didn't feel right to hit the button to buzz her over. That's just weird. I get their trying to under staff and save on waitresses but it's a weird encounter. The waitress was nice though with good recommendations but still.

The toast here was not even warm my butter didn't even melt (wtf)? It looked like they were pre toasting the bread to save time. I asked the waitress and she said it's what they do since it gets so \"busy\". I've seen the original location twice as \"busy\" as this place but they don't half assed on their quality.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to the downtown location.",

After grabbing a seat at the bar it took over 15 minutes for the bartender to address me and provide me with a menu.  After another 10 minutes I was able to order a drink, however, based on how long it took to just order a drink I decided to pass on food, as I was on a layover and needed time to make it to my next flight. I received my drink, which had no alcohol, so I addressed in with the waitress, who gave me an attitude.  After that it only went further downhill, leading me to ask for my check and leave.  I can only imagine working in an airpot restaurant may be tough, tired customers, rushed to get drinks and food, etc, but I was none of those.  I only ordered a drink and expressed a concern, especially for the price I was paying and received an attitude.  Definitely not the customer service experience I was hoping for.  I will definitely pass on Matt's next time I am in the Phoenix airport and visit another patron.",

The bacon is thick cut but still crispy and not hard/chewy like it can be, with a nice pepper crust that was really tasty.  I almost upgraded to ham but I'm glad I didn't because the people at the table next to us found it too salty to eat and others commented on the saltiness as well.  But everything else we had was great.    My husband got the steak and eggs and cut the entire stake with a butterknife - tender and tasty.",

Admittedly, my Phoenix airport eatery experience is a bit limited, but after drinking liquor of questionable quality until the wee hours of the morning, this burrito quite possibly saved my life.   Although the menu only lists bacon and sausage as meat options, chorizo was a nice surprise choice. Beware, it's going to take 15 minutes for this thing because it's real food, and they have to grill the burrito.

This place has bar seating as well. I tried the $13 chili cheese burger and the $9 breakfast burrito served with chorizo. You could choose sausage or bacon instead of chorizo. The burger was huge and came with a side of French fries. My bf thought they didn't give enough fries. The burrito came with a side of pico de gallo. It wasn't enough so I asked for a 2nd but I think 3 would have been enough for me. I liked the burrito more than the burger. It was surprisingly super spicy. The burger had an awesome fluffy bun but a very thin piece of meat and some drier chunks of ground beef in the chili. The chili was more just ground beef and some beans than a chili. It wasn't very wet at all. The shredded cheese inside wasn't really melted. The water they gave tasted like there was a bit of lime. It had a metal flavor to me. I like the interior decor (had a giant pig on the wall and large bench-style seats with long round leather pillows) and music playlist (indie music). Their downtown location was featured on the TV show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.",

The service was spectacular, even the host who had to put up with a lot of attitude from angry people who didn't want to wait for a table.   The menu prices were decent too, aside from the alcohol of course. But the hog and chick breakfast was $10.99 and comes with all the usual fixings. This is more affordable than most brunch places nowadays, but it was stellar! The toast and bacon were memorable.

Small salty dried out pucks. I actually knocked them on the plate and they made a hard pinging sound which amused my neighbors. The potatoes were soggy with grease and tasted like funky rosemary. My hotcake came out flat as a crepe. It at least was edible after I drenched it in butter and syrup. Even the bacon was dry and chewy. How do you mess up bacon???  I hope the management starts to pay better attention to the quality of the food being served. I've worked in restaurants before so I know breakfast can be especially hard to manage and I don't like leaving bad reviews but what happened today was inexcusable.",

Service: No one cleaned the area I sat at, it took a while for anyone to get me a drink, my order was wrong and I asked for an iced tea to go twice and didn't get one. Luckily, the nice fellow that sat next me ordered an iced tea to go and he gave me his.   Good: While my order was wrong, I did enjoy what I got which was the breakfast burrito without jalapenos and potatoes.

The description in the menu said bacon, lettuce and tomato. Clearly the person in charge of doling out the bacon just got finished pouring the double shots of Maker's Mark. They told us we were getting, and they actually got excited about this, freshly made kettle chips. If they didn't open a bag of Walmart kettle chips and pour them on the plate, then I've clearly never had authentically made kettle chips.

Service was somewhat slow - it was after 8pm and one person was working the register and running orders, as far as I could tell, so she would disappear for a few minutes at a time.  The burrito? Big soft flour tortilla. I got sausage, and the sausage was okay, nothing special. The eggs were dry and scant, and the potatoes needed to be in smaller chunks. Flavor was just missing, and the salsa was unimpressive. Overall, I'm glad I tried it, because now I know not to bother. It's probably better if you get a plate with bacon or something baked, judging by the crowds - I just hope that the disappointing burrito was not representative as I like their farm-to-table concept.",

Ones that can't get the same job outside of the airport.   But, this place is especially bad. I'm an okay cook. Maybe pretty good. But not great. I could make better food than this place all day. It's terrible. If you need to eat a meal, it will do the job. But that's it. For example, the burger is really just pathetic. It's a very low quality ground meat. I mean something you wouldn't even see available at the grocery store. The bun overwhelms the meat because the burger itself cooks to a withering lump. Everything they put on the side to load the burger is equally unsatisfying. Nobody cares about the price in an airport. You have a captive group of buyers. Make good food.   Service is sub par but nothing unusual for an airport. Just your typical waiting too long for everything even though you're obviously waiting to catch a flight. When I'm flashing my credit card though, let's get the transaction done. Don't walk away telling me my receipt is in the cup next to me. When is the last time somebody looked at a receipt in a restaurant. Just pay me out.",

    "text": "FLY THRU BREAKFAST  I was flying through the PHX airport & had a 3 hour layover. I searched Yelp & found many 4 star restaurants. How could this be? It's an airport! Airports never have good food, so I decided to spend some time walking around checking them out before making my choice. I finally decided to eat at Matt's because it seemed like the all American Breakfast.   The place was packed at 8:30 in the morning. I wanted to sit at the bar but took the first available seat at a community table. I then noticed there were power outlets scattered through the space but not every seat had access to power. I then asked the hostess if she could find me a spot where I could eat and juice up my phone. She spotted an opening at the bar & told me to grab it. When I arrived I had to squeeze between two guys. My new neighbors were excited to learn about the outlets & they quickly plugged in their devices. So be aware power is available here you're just going to need to find it before you sit down.   I looked through the menu & I wanted to eat everything. I finally decided to go with Matt's Big Breakfast. It had a little bit of everything. I must also point out that the food is made fresh from scratch with the finest local ingredients around. I love that & I could taste that love in the food.   My dish came with 3 fresh cage free eggs which I ordered sunny side up. These eggs were no yolk. The eggs tasted amazing & reminded me of Phil's Organic Eggs we buy in the Chicagoland area.  This place locally sources there food & it makes a difference.   The thick cut bacon is from a local butcher in Queen Creek, AZ & it was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly & had hints of pepper on it. My breakfast even had sausage that was formed into patties. The sausage came from a local butcher up the street near their downtown location. It was some of the freshest sausage I've ever had. I loved it because it reminded me of the sausage patties I make at home for breakfast. It is so nice to have a hand formed patty &!not something over processed & frozen in a factory.   I really liked the home fries. I'm usually not a fan because this breakfast item at other restaurants is always tasteless & dry but not here. A lot of love goes into this side dish. They take Yukon Gold Potatoes, first boil them, then they bake them and finally finish them off by frying them in butter. They also add some sauteed onions & then season them with salt, pepper & rosemary. These potatoes are as good as my breakfast potatoes & I don't share that kind of compliment with just anyone.   I washed all of that down with a house made griddle cake which is just a fancy word for pancake. This was one of the best pancakes I've had in a long time. The best part it was topped with real sweet cream butter & real Maple syrup. Both of these toppings pushed this amazing griddle cake beyond extraordinary. I didn't use all the butter but it tasted like real butter which is something I don't taste anymore with all of the fake processed food we are being served. I'd like to pass a law that says, \"If there is no Real Syrup then you can not serve pancakes!\"  Sorry Aunt Jemima but you don't cut it anymore. Real is the way to go.   Prior to leaving to go & catch my plane I stopped at the pass to tell the staff how much I loved their food. I wanted them to know I appreciated all of their hard work.  They were cranking out some great food. The kitchen space is not big at all yet they kept making fantastic food to hungry travelers.   There were many breakfast options on the menu. I was enjoying seeing what all my neighbors at the bar were getting.  The scrambled eggs with spicy salami looked so good. It was on my list but it didn't come with a pancake so I opted for Matt's Big Breakfast. The breakfast sandwich & breakfast burrito looked good too. I would love to mention that this place is priced great & it won't break your travel budget. My whole dish was $12.50 which is totally reasonable for everything I ordered.   I must mention that there is a full bar. Everyone around me was drinking but it was 8:30am on a Friday morning. I couldn't do it, after 8 days in Vegas. I really didn't want to see liquor again.  The real temptation was when the person across from me ordered one of the Bloody Mary's. I wanted to ask them if I could take a photo of it but I didn't want to be that guy. It was one of those that was not only a drink but a meal too.  I will always have an image of that masterpiece in my head.   So if you're flying through PHX then do your foodie homework because there are many great options to eat at here. You will really be surprised at all the great ratings for the restaurants. I do highly recommend you stop in here for breakfast. Matt's has a great All-American breakfast that will keep you going all day long. You make me want to connect through PHX now when I fly.",

It's a great Phoenix staple!  First things first, service here is FAST which is very appreciative especially at an airport. They have portable credit card machines they will bring to your table after your meal to pay so three people could pay at once without having waiters scrambling around the small space to run your card, run back to you, then run back to the table to pick up the tip receipt.  We got sat right next to the waiter station and our waiter was very attentive and fast. I got the chop and chick this time because I really liked the pieces of pork chop I stole from my boyfriend last time ... :P and he got the breakfast sandwich. Instead of the lemonades, he got a bloody mary and I got a mimosa in a stemless wine glass.    I would say quality, service, and prices are the same at both locations we went to. This would probably be the definition of a good restaurant to try out at the airport here.",

    "text": "I recently traveled through the Phenix airport on my way back home from San Diego. After a wonderful two weeks spent there as well as Las Vegas I had the misfortune of dining at your restaurant. The waitress was extremely rude. My wife ordered food from what we were told was the takeaway section. With us being from out of town we had no way of knowing that we had the option to sit and place our order. So we got our food and sat down. We were approached by the waitress who said that this was her section and that we could not sit there because we ordered at takeaway even though it's the same business and they only had a handful of customers. She was more concerned about the possibility of not getting a tip because we ordered takeaway than the fact that my wife's food was burnt. Her only concern was that we leave her station. We were not the only ones that this happened to. So it's ok for customers to patronize your business and even leave a tip when ordering but unless you sit down and order through a waitress you have to leave the establishment. I'm sure that on my next trip I will certainly not being visiting this place. I will however be letting everyone I know as well as posting it online how we were treated.",

Then after I gave her what I understand is the usual $1 per (airport overpriced) drink tip, she starts acting up and being sarcastic about her service not been good and that we should let her know what she did wrong so that she can get better because we gave her such a bad tip.

My waitress seemed to be in a hurry asking if we're ready to order every 30 seconds. The menu sucks in my opinion not enough options to choose from. Also, from the getgo I told my waitress that I will have my drink with my food(apparently she forgot). Instead of her pouring that out she put it in a refrigerator and then brought me the same glass of Strawberry Lemonade once my food was ready. This is just not the place for me. I went to IHOP and got a better breakfast the next day. With a much cheaper bill.   P. S. Original Breakfast House is much better!!!",

The lady next to me was being really difficult and making a custom sandwich, and the bartender was so accommodating. Next time I am in terminal 4 gate b I will definitely come back here!

Took our order and a guy in the kitchen screamed are order to the cooks. Our food was served up quickly.

I actually set my fork down after the first bite. That was the best waffle I have ever had in my life. I usually don't react to food that way, and I wasn't happy with our somewhat rude waitress, so for the food to turn me around on the place that quickly is impressive, to say the least.  The waitress is the only reason I took a star away, and I'm willing to accept that we may have just caught her at a bad time. Unfortunately, we don't travel through that airport normally, so I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to go back and give them another shot.",

Maybe just my taste buds but despite the reviews I read, the rosemary seasoning is overwhelming and the potatoes seem undercooked. Looking at empty plates as I left, I see lots of uneaten potatoes so I suggest the chef rethink their recipe. Valentin was my server and he was good and the speed of service was good. The toast is about 1/2 inch thick and more like a dessert; again not my cup of tea but whatever. Crossing this place off my airport stops; will stand in line at Wendy's next time. Sorry!!",

Steak fries seemed to be prepackaged. Burger was \"just ok.\" My friend asked what it would cost to add jalapenos to her burger and was told 2$ -- deary me, that was a no go, and put a bad taste in our mouths.   Service was slow on getting the food out. The server, however, was somewhat apologetic about it. All in all is was just an average/ok experience.",

I can't speak to the remarks on the pricing versus the original restaurant, but you can have a pretty darned good breakfast here for the typical airport prices. We enjoyed our breakfast in the dining area. The place gets packed! We lucked out and snagged a couple spots at one of the community tables. It's definitely dining in close quarters but it's passable given it's in the airport. I ordered the skinny breakfast- which is egg whites with gruyere, spinach and chicken sausage served with a green salad. It was the perfect meal and amount of food before boarding a 4 hour flight. My husband ordered Matt's Big Breakfast- which is eggs, sausage, bacon potatoes, and a pancake! Plenty of food for sure. The servers were all in great spirits and super friendly but the food was slow to come out. We had time to spare so it was fine but if you're in a time crunch keep that in mind!",

Customer Service  -Its an airport, people are not trying to be there all day. Now I'm not saying the wait staff should put on running sneakers but at least be efficient and by efficient I mean don't be on your phone in view on costumers for several minutes while people are trying to flag you down. On that note, don't look down on your phone while taking someones order and then get annoyed with them when you bring out the wrong order. Unless you were texting the chef, I'm pretty sure it was your lack of listening skills to blame on that one.   Food  It was edible. Again, it beats a $6 bag of Doritos. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad, but it served its purpose in that starve to death at the airport.   Overall I don't think I've ever had a great experience eating at the airport and this was no different. Usually I get decent costumer service though, so that sort of added insult to injury in this case.

I was flying solo and was found a seat quickly when I approached.     I tell you, the customer service here alone was enough to make me want to go back!  The host and the server were both excellent.    The food I had also was spot on!  I had burger with this jalapeno aioli that reminded me of hatch green chilis!! Not sure what they did but man it was so yummy!   I also paid a couple extra bucks and got the steak fries.  Normally not my thing but these came out crispy and were served with an A1 BBQ sauce.   So good together with the burger.  I can't speak to the breakfast as I only had dinner here but I'd be willing to try it out if in Phoenix for breakfast!    Safe travels!!!!",

By the time the olives arrived the shot of vodka we were given was already gone. Asked for the bill and they wanted $17 per drink which I would have happily paid if we had received an actual drink. Manager shows up with no customer service skills and simply explained that all of the drinks are pre measured and that's it. No thanks. Terrible service and clearly a business that doesn't care about the customer base that supports them.",

My server was prompt and the drinks / food came quickly, however, the fruit was so old looking I couldn't bring myself to eat it. One of my pet peeves is wasting food so I can't recall a time I sent something back but in this case I was willing to forego that side all together. The server tried without me asking to get a fresher bowl but she even admitted upon her return from the kitchen that it all looked unappetizing. She didn't offer another side of anything else to make up for the rotten fruit. If you have the time for a sit down meal, take a moment to find another eatery. In hindsight, I'm sure Wendy's next door would have been better...",

Given their before mentioned slowness, after receiving my food, I had to get on the plane, only to then discover, instead of oatmeal, they gave me an egg, bacon and cheese sandwich with potatoes.

The food and service were outstanding.  I sat at one of the high top tables.  Plenty of room for my bag under my feet sitting there.  It was lunch so I ordered a burger.  I ordered straight from the menu, but many people requested special needs burgers and they were happy to comply.   My burger came out fast, it was cooked to perfection, very flavorful, well seasoned and just the right temperature.  My iced tea was fresh and clean.  My server, Valentin, was top notch.  A fun guy who took care of everyone with special requests and understood that in an airport environment people need to eat fast and pay fast.  He made each person around me feel special and like they were his only customer.  I can't explain it. Some people just have a gift of working with the public.  He offered to get me a to go cup of iced tea.  He is now a friend for life.  I fly into Phoenix a lot so I will be a regular customer here and, in fact, look forward to it being a highlight of future trips.  It's that good.",

The plate was covered in the grease from the omelet, which was overcooked and chewy .The potatoes were both burnt and cold.   The bartenders treated the patrons like a nuisance. Zero chance of getting a coffee refill. The place was packed when I sat down and emptied out by the time I got my meal.

I had high hopes at first because they were able to accommodate my request to substitute meat for pancakes at no extra charge, however my dreams were crushed when the food came out less than 5 minutes later.   The pancakes just weren't good. I've had \"just add water\" box pancakes better than these.  I requested scrambled eggs, but I got a fried egg chopped up. The potatoes were cold and tasted as if they threw some hour-old potatoes on my plate. I love Matt's potatoes, so I know how they should taste.   When I told my waiter my issues with the food she took my plate back to the kitchen. Then she returned with the check, expressing how she gave me a 10% discount. I hate ate a few bites of my food, so I was baffled that she was charging me basically full price for a meal I did not eat. I agreed to pay for the pancakes because I ate most of them, but refused to pay for the eggs and potatoes. The manager approached me, and with a not so great attitude told me they weren't going to charge me for the meal. He didn't apologize for the terrible service, but instead acted as if I was just being problematic.   Again, I love Matt's Big Breakfast, but I will stick with the downtown location and never patronage at the airport location again!",

For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both local Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.  I think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. A take away counter. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done.",

Could not pass up trying the Bloody Mary (even though I don't actually like vodka) once I saw the bacon!  The cheese was a little weird, not gonna lie.  Also had the enormous Reuben sandwich, which was really delicious.  Service was great, friendly, food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was comforting.  Would definitely eat here again if given the chance.",

They even cooked my eggs the way I wanted (done very well) without me having to send it back to cook longer. The food was so much and so good that we couldn't finish, but we wanted to so badly.

    "text": "We purchased two \"Classic Ruben\" sandwiches on the 16th of November 2015 for take-out. Sorry I do not have photos, but my wife gave the second sandwich to the American Airlines stewardess as trash before I could get photos.  What to notice first - despite having many small sealed bags of \"chips,\" Matt's tossed a handful of loose chips in with the sandwich. An hour into our flight, they were all soggy, having lost all crispness. Matt's saved a few cents by dumping in their bulk chips. Shame! Matt's sandwich was premium-priced at about $11.  An excellent Reuben outside the Sky Harbor is in the $6-10 range.  A $11 Ruben should be amazing.  I doubt anyone at this Matt's has ever seen or had a Classic Ruben.  Matt's used bread that was sliced into extra thick 1\" thick slabs.  If it was \"rye,\" the grain was a minority contributor.  The sandwich was cut into two rectangles, like a grade school peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Classic Rubens are cut on a diagonal!  The corned-beef was tough and the quantity very small.  You could hardly taste any sauerkraut or Russian dressing.  Sky Harbor diners from the \"coasts\" should stay away from this atrocity to avoid disappointment. However, we give credit to the \"grill-man\" for getting nice \"grill-marks\" on the bread!",

This is good, honest food. I just got off a plane from a super early flight and was pretty hungry. I ordered 2 eggs over-easy (which were expertly cooked), rosemary home fries, thick-cut bacon, and really thick rye toast with fresh squeezed OJ. The toast was too thick for my liking because i like to use it to sop up the yolk, but it was accompanied by raspb preserves. left full and walking a little slower. They make everything to order, so don't stop if you're about to jump on a plane, but it's worth the stop if you have the time. The OJ was $5 which seemed pricey to me for what it was. The meal was about $15, but you certainly pay for convenience when in an airport and I didn't have a problem with the price when considering the meal.",

One does not expect customer service like this at an airport restaurant - the bartender (geez, I wish I could remember his name) was exemplary.  It was so much fun to watch him work - providing great service to all and doing so with a smile on his face and a serious spring in his step.  I would eat there again in a heartbeat.

Every last one of them walk right by me pretty much did not give me eye contact nor even say good morning. One young lady walk right by me and walk to the other side of the restaurant to help someone. It gets so old coming into an establishment to give your hard earned money and just be blatantly ignored. Finally I asked a young Lady,\"hey, can anyone even see me here!!\" The Manager Desi walked by and asked was everything ok, I said absolutely not!! You have 5 people includifee yourself that saw me come in and no one even said good morning!! Not to mention everyone simply ignored me!! I told the manager Desi this is totally unacceptable not to mention I am an Airline employee, also I frequent the first Matt's Big Breakfast downtown for years. Then her attitude changed a little. Truly this is not a good way to start your day or to spend your hard-earned money for breakfast. I could not figure out what was so different about me ...I can only guess!!....after all that I had to ask for water, more Coffee, wow!!!!",

The staff at Matt's is accommodating, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable.  The quality of the ingredients  is evident in everybite. Matt's takes breakfast  to a new level.   Matt's big breakfast, is just that, big. Matt's serves classic breakfast food with a  twist of unique combinations.   Today I had salami  and eggs, homestule potatoes, sourdough bread with homemade peach preserves.  All I can say about the peach preserve is it was absolutely delicious and it's made at Matt's daily.  If your looking for a great breakfast at a reasonable price give Matt's a try.",

The home fries that some people rave about were soggy, greasy and heavily over flavored with rosemary, not to mention Luke warm. The bacon was inedible salty. The toast came out with enough butter for a whole loaf of bread. The over easy eggs were actually fine, thus one star. The waitress never asked why I left all of my home fries uneaten, not a sign of good service. Expensive and NOT worth it.",

Airport restaurants need to be efficient and turn tables around quickly.  Not at Matt's... open when they eventually get it together and the made from scratch approach doesn't jive with the punctuality required in an airport.

We drank the \"martinis\". Then she brought us three olives. We were given olives with no martini left literally because it was about an ounce of vodka. We get our bill and the \"blue cheese martinis\" were $17 a pop! we NEVER complain while at a restaurant and we spend serious money eating and drinking out but we just had to say something here as it was absurd. Manager comes over and tells us he didn't believe us because his martinis are poured using a jigger!!!! Literally I cannot make this up.   Guys seriously that's highway robbery- you want to market a freaking blue cheese martini and sell it for $17. I'm cool with that! But make a freaking blue cheese martini, with blue cheese olives, served how a martini should be. What we just got was 1- bad customer service because the manager called us liars (indirectly), and 2- a snifter of vodka with olive juice in it.   Highway robbery. Not cool. Seriously just take the drink off the menu if you can't serve it properly, don't take advantage of people.",

The pancake was nice and thin and barely needed syrup or butter. The homefries were amazing and the eggs cooked perfect. Total came out to around $14 incl. tip which isn't too bad.

In an airport, not making your clients sick and timeliness are probably the top 2 minimum objectives. Customers behind me received their orders sooner, which is not great when the waiting time starts to encroach into your boarding time. The most in-your-face obstinance was the supervisor's insistence that, \"well, we have to heat it up individually.\" Yea, okay, soup can be boiled in like 4 minutes and soondobu can be made from scratch in less than 20 min. So no, uh-uh, no thank you, never again. I'll know better next time.",

I think it was around $9 for the Five Spot Platter and around $8 for the egg salad sandwich. Both were big portions and I distinctly remember the bacon in the Five Spot Platter being extra-large, juicy, and thick.   Sometimes, after a long flight you want to get fed and filled up like a dump truck. Matt's will take care of that for you. It was also close to our American Airlines terminal.  Also, it was open late which is a relief because as it turns out there are a ton of options to eat in this airport but a lot of them aren't open late (11pm or later).   I should also shout-out our waitress. She was an absolute hoot. Being from drought-stricken California, I asked for water tentatively. She responded by ribbing me and saying she would have to check if \"water\" was on the menu. All in good fun and she was super attentive even though Matt's was packed. Must be the whole open-late thing.   Very hefty, very filling, and because everyone says breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would recommend putting Matt at the top of your list of places to eat in Phoenix's airport.",

He was looking down at his phone and did not look up at all as I approached nor as I was standing in front of him. He asked \"bar or table\" without even looking up but completed his text message. I waited for him to at least make eye contact at which point he asked me again, \"bar Or table\" in a tone that made me feel as though I was seriously inconveniencing him.",

And don't expect an item listed as a \"Tossed Cobb Salad\" to not be tossed, served in a pile with cold fatty bacon, and dressing on the side.   But the worst part was the amazingly grouchy hostess. Have you seen the Seinfeld episode with the soup Nazi? Picture that. Super rude...lately me rephrase that SUPER RUDE!!! I mentioned it to the waitress who told me that I need to give her a break because it was only her third or fourth day on the job. I thought, are you kidding me? This is how she behaves and she JUST started there? What will her behavior be like after she gets tired of being there.  To be clear, I was in a really good mood when I got there. I had the perfect amount of time for a layover, had a great flight and a great business trip, I wasn't too concerned about the price as my meals were being covered by my clients. I smiled and tried to be friendly and she was just a grouch. I have no idea what her problem was but projecting it on me was unprofessional and just unkind.  A hostess is \"paid\" to be friendly. That IS their job. To kindly greet guests, warm them up for the waiter, and then find an appropriate seat.  Honestly, the server wasn't much better. She had a \"mildly pissy\" attitude. Not as bad as the other.  I gave this 2 stars and I'm not sure why I even gave that many. I guess 1 1/2 would be appropriate but I'm feeling generous.  I'm pretty sure that the restaurant won't contact me but I wish they would.  If you're stuck in the airport, try somewhere else.",

(I'm one of those people that cuts it a little too close sometimes).  I was starving though, and knew I needed to eat something prior to the five hour flight!  Luckily, Matt's came to the rescue!  I ordered a Sonrisa Burrito to-go.  It comes with eggs, cheese, jalapeno peppers, potatoes, and your choice of bacon or sausage.  I ordered mine with sausage and no potatoes.  It was a generous serving and I actually ended up splitting it with my husband.  We devoured it and agreed that it was delicious.  I would have liked some salsa to go with it though.  Next time, I'll ask for that!  I'm now writing this review on the flight and feeling good after filling my belly... If you find yourself at Sky Harbor anywhere close to Terminal 4 - B gates, Matt's is a great option.  You can eat in or take it to-go.  So glad that we have so many decent options at the PHX airport now!  Bon appetit and safe travels!",

After I ordered my breakfast burrito it took 20 minutes to get it. I counted 8 people in the kitchen. Not all cooks I'm sure but come on, how hard is a breakfast burrito??  I had to eat it on the plane because of how long it took and it was just meh, so all in all a huge disappointment.",

The toast was very homemade style, very yummy, thick and delicious!  Jam was the same, also yummy, thick and delicious.  A perfect combo.    Washed that down with an extra spicy Bloody Mary, topped with cheeses, olive, and a thick slice of crispy bacon.    I know when I'm back, I will take time to visit again.  Thanks! CHEERS!!",

    "text": "May 2, 2019 Thursday - 8 AM for Breakfast 1 adult  Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 4 stars  Background - I knew I had a long layover, and I also knew there was a Diner, Drive-In and Dives alternate location inside Sky Harbor.  For me alternate triple D locations are where they did not film the show at this location but related to the film location.  I walked off the plane and boom there they were.  Atmosphere - A sit down relax airport restaurant.  The bar seating area was large, which is ideal for the solo traveler.  So I ended sitting there, no point of taking a two person table.  Best part of sitting at the bar is that there is an outlet either to right or left below the counter, near your knees.     Food   Drink - I had Kilt Lifter by Four Peaks Brewing Company a local brewery, which they actually have a bar in the airport too.  I gotta love how no one judges you for having a beer at 8 AM.    Breakfast - I love a good breakfast burrito and the Sonrisa caught my eye immediately.  The burrito was grilled lightly on the flat top to give a crisp toasty texture to the tortilla.  I would have like my potatoes to been a little smaller and the chorizo to be a little larger.  Just a person preference.  The chorizo was a crumble and very tasty.  The salsa had a nice smoke taste, but I found it too watery.  So it was not good for dipping my burrito so I had to pour it onto my burrito.  The burrito was cut in half and I was using my hand to hold it instead of using the real silverware fork and knife they provide.  Service - I was in an out in 30 minutes, which is what you want in an airport.  The down side of the place was they did not have a True hostess working today, or ever I do not know.  But a couple of the waiters were working the station plus my bartender from behind the bar.  My bartender seemed like a carny try to get people into the place, so that was kinda an atmosphere killer.  Future - If I have time I will be back, hopefully I can get back to the original location.",

    "text": "down-home Southern-style - a cut above for airport food  I had the reuben sandwich with a side of macaroni, with the freshly-squeezed lemonade with honey. The marble rye bread on the sandwich had crust embedded with what tasted like caraway seeds, and was lightly toasted, and fresh-tasting. The pastrami is made in-house, the sign says. The meat was so-so with more fat than I expect, and the sauerkraut lacked flavor. The macaroni salad was really flavorful and I savored each bite. Now the standout for this meal was the lemonade!! I could suck down a gallon and still want more. Ironically, I was trying to avoid excess sugar, and though the sign claims that there's no added sugar, they do add a LOT of honey, which does contain tons of natural sugar, though sugar is sugar, and as addictive as cocaine and heroin, I keep reading in my holistic health blogs. That comes as no surprise.   I'd love to write more, but I am way behind on everything. Anyway, what a buzzkill I can \"bee\". Get the lemonade here, and enjoy life! Airports are really hard to be in, with all the waiting and the loud jarring noises, abominable behaviors right and left, and being WAAAAYYYYY to close for comfort to everyone in all those hellhole godawful tightly crowded stinky nasty airplanes (I don't fly first class - I'm so middle-class I can't bear to part with extra money for a few hours of a little more leg room and I don't need free cheap headache booze and used dirty blankets), so soothe yourself by eating what makes you happy, then exercise like crazy later.  What's not clear at all is that if you order at the counter, you take your food to go and you are supposed to eat it elsewhere, like at your gate, not in the restaurant, I later found out. Well, I committed a faux pas, unknowingly, and sat in the restaurant at a table right behind the counter where I placed my order. I apologized to the waiter who came by, and I asked if I should move, but he was gracious, and let me stay.   The other menu items, like the cheeseburger, looked really tempting.   People were enjoying themselves with beers, watching the futbol/soccer highlights reel at the bar.",

I'll opt for a Wendy's burger that's 2 stalls down instead - they have better quality and better value.  I'm giving this place 2 stars because the beer was that good.",

The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable.  The hostess was friendly as was the person that delivered my food.  Good experience all around - which I certainly appreciate when in the midst of airport hustle/bustle.",

    "text": "So as I strolled through the Phoenix Airport I moved passed the regular fast food breakfast fare and came across Matt's Big Breakfast and thought \"this is the place.\"  The tables were packed and the \"to go\" line seemed to be moving quickly.  I checked my phone (25-30 minutes to boarding STARTED), read over the menu (Breakfast Burrito for the win) and got in line.    The young guy working as very nice despite the fact he was obviously SLAMMED.  I should've taken the clue that 1 guy taking all the orders, pouring all the coffee, and having to run around the bar to pick up the to go food was a harbinger of issues to come, but I forged on.  He took my name and gave me my receipt.  As time continued to pass I started forgetting who ordered what and when and I noticed the crowd outside of the restaurant continued to grow, and grow, and grow.  It was cool though, I still had 20 minutes left.  Around the 25 minutes of waiting mark I figured it was time to see if I was close.  As I waited in the line AGAIN, to check the status of my food, I noticed that 3 of the 7 people in the line were doing the same thing.  I reached the front, informed the clerk that I NEEDED my food because I'd waited 30 minutes and my plane was boarding soon.  He informed me my food was up soon.  I waited about 7-8 more minutes after that and was handed my burrito.  No bag, no napkin.  Just the burrito.  As I ran off I overheard another lady requesting a refund because she couldn't wait for her food anymore.  Once I finally boarded my plane (and had to check my bag because I was one of the last 5 people to enter it), I was ready to eat.  The burrito itself was \"meh\" at best.  The standout was the bacon, it was amazing and it was obviously this wasn't some low cost meat, I found myself wishing the rest of the burrito emulated this taste.  It didn't.  The eggs had next to no flavor and were oily, and I'm about 90% sure the potatoes were cooked in some form of olive oil as well, because that's the only taste they had.    Overall, I wished I had as great an experience as everyone else who sat down, ate and reviewed, however I wasn't so lucky.  Beyond having a friendly person, the express counter was a joke (40 minutes, that's good right?) and the burrito beyond the bacon completely lacked flavor.  Maybe it was just a bad day I attended, but I don't know if I'll roll the dice again.  If you go, make sure you have an hour plus and skip the burrito.",

The original plan was to eat a good dinner and try to fall asleep... Unfortunately our plan didn't work out.   We didn't get our bags until about 845 and all the restaurants were closed, so we scarfed down a pizza. Around 2 am I was searching on Yelp for some good breakfast.   I got the steak and eggs and it was cooked to perfection. Most steak and eggs are overly cooked but this steak was JUICY. My wife got a waffle with bacon. The waffle was so fluffy and had just about enough sweetness. The bacon here is also amazing. Never had bacon like this before. It was a thicker cut and seasoned with pepper. She also got a mimosa and I got a Bloody Mary. Both were really good. Thanks Matt's Big Breakfast for making this long lay over enjoyable.",

And no one took the burrito. So I went back to ask nicely if perhaps that was mine and she yelled at me and told me now. I waited and waited again (now the burrito is cold) and asked if it was possible she forgot to type in my name. She angrily grabbed my receipt and checked the times. \"Oh I guess it's yours, sorry\". So now I've paid $10 for a cold burrito that i waited 35 minutes for. No thanks. Will never come again.",

But the fancy salad, tossed \"cobb\" salad, egg salad sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, and macaroni salad are all VERY bland. Trust me on this one. And the tomato soup tastes like maranara sauce, but is super good for dipping the awesome grilled cheese into. Tomato soup by itself....meh. Plus....it's $7 DOLLARS for one bowl of tomato soup. No. Everything else is well worth the money. If you have any issues with your food ever, just let your server know (nicely) and they'll gladly fix it for you, seriously. Also...they don't carry ranch. WHAT!?!?! In America?????? Lame. But all their food is seriously thebomb. com, and I suggest you get with your server to help you choose. they're usually WAY busy,  but most of the time very friendly and willing to give you an honest opinion.   Personally, I recommend the Sweet N Savory french toast. WOW. And that applewood smoked pork sausage???? WWWWOWWWW",

While this is one of the nicest Airport restaurants I've eaten in, and the food (when it finally arrived) was quite good, there were just way too many snafus for me to give them more then 3 stars.   To start, 3 of us got there before the others - thank you priority check-in! So we ordered a good 15 minutes before the rest of the group. Needless to say, after 45mins, watching the rest of the group get their meals, and finish, we still had not got our meals. Everyone shared, so I can tell you the Cobb salad, super good as are the fries. Now after trying to ask our waitress, a few times, to find out what happened to our meals, she kept saying the kitchen was busy and it will come when it comes... We all knew this was not right, no matter how busy a kitchen is, food ordered first, comes first if it is the same item. Well after 45 minutes of ignoring our concerns, finally she let us know that the food runner had brought our 3 meals to another table over half an hour ago. Right.... So now we need to board a flight, they quickly make us our meals, it comes out under cooked, we have a few bites before running to board, we get the bill and the 3 of us have our meals 10% compt. 10 freaking percent?!!! You have got to be kidding me Matt's! That is so unacceptable for a 45 minute wait, major screw up and then undercooked food that comes out and the 3 of us ate less then a quarter of. Not impressed.",

    "text": "I had eaten at MBB downtown once and was a fan of the food they served there. I really am behind the city's initiative to encourage local successful restaurants to open up locations in Sky Harbor airport, and Matt's Big Breakfast is a treat! They also have Lolo's Chicken n' Waffles, Deluxe Burger and Chelsea's Open Kitchen to name a few local fav spots that we frequent in town and at PHX. MBB is precisely what it sounds like Big Breakfasts. Keep in mind, it is located at Terminal 4 AFTER YOU CLEAR SECURITY.  Whatever tickles your first meal of the day fancy can be tickled deeply and thoroughly here. The menu is a True journey through morning comfort food presented in more bountiful and gourmet style that your regular combo #6 at your local slop n' drop diner. Last time I ate there before a flight I had a massive omelette with rosemary potatoes (which are amazing btw). My wife had poached eggs and off the bone ham which seemed to have come right from the farm! The only caution I would give is to make sure you have time to have a sit-down-and-order mea. The service is pretty fast but the clients come in waves and everyone seems to need to catch the same flight. l had to chase down our server to run my card as it seemed everyone in the place was trying to pay at once and were likely mostly on the same flight so be sure you're not in a photo-finish situation to your gate. For those in a rush, I think they also have a walk-up counter and sling breakfast sammies to go for those wanting to stink up economy class with their brought-on food...a practice I abhor. I never bring hot food onto a plane. It's rude. Bring a cold sandwich or a salad and leave your stinky McRaunchy's or Blazing burritos in the terminal! MBB...come hungry and then enjoy your post breakfast drooling coma as you soar the clear blue skies!",

Local coffee served from Roastery of Cave Creek. The panda needed that caffeine.  Five Spot Platter ($8.95): Breakfast sandwich with bacon, American cheese, two eggs, and grilled onions. Potatoes on the side. The roll is large, with a small layer of filler. On the plus side, the roll was soft and fluffy. The roll's flavor reminded me of a croissant. The potatoes were seasoned generously with salt and pepper. Bacon was excellent. Good portion. Overall, I'd say The Five Spot hit the spot.  I just sat at the bar for this one. Good service.  I saw others at the bar ordering Reubens. Hefty sandwiches that are recommended by the staff if you want a nice-sized lunch.  I'll have to remember this place next time, should I opt for a very gluttonous meal.",

I travel a lot for work and I am always flying out of sky harbor airport, when I do I usually always stop by Matt's. They have a variety of stuff to choose from, everything from breakfast to burgers as well as some great sandwiches. You get a lot of bang for your buck as well, most places in the airport are super expensive and you don't get a lot of food. Matt's gives you great size portions! They are also very quick so if you are in a hurry but don't want to eat fast food, Matt's will get you in and out in a hurry.",

Seating for 2 are so close to your neighbors that I saw a heavy set guy walk away from the place.   Even regular sized customers were way too close together. A shot of Baileys for your coffee was $12.00 and they had no idea what a side of red was..... I don't frequent Phoenix but if I did, I wouldn't go back.",

I am always looking for bloodies with fun garnishes.  This one looked fun!  Every garnish was meh.  The cheese seemed like it was going bad, the olives were drying out and the pickle was the worst pickle probably in the history of pickling.  I love pickles! How does one make a mediocre pickle?  I did not think it was possible.  The best garnish was the celery LOL.  Oh, and the bacon was so yuck!  Moving on to the bloody mary.  Nothing special at all.  I ordered a veggie omelette with cheddar.  It was good.  I have had better omelettes.  It wasn't fluffy and the veggies were somewhat greasy.  My sweets had a burger and said it was overcooked and there was nothing special about it.  Like I said, I have no clue what is so special about this place.  All in all don't eat here expecting a fresh over the top delish breakfast.  Expect average truck stop food pretending to be something worth talking about.",

They also have the best bacon, most deliciously seasoned potatoes, and garagantuously trimmed $14 bacon Bloody Mary's (for airport food, I'll take it). Their sourdough toast with housemade jam is also not to be missed.  Worth the treck to the B gates if you have the time before takeoff.",

It was bad enough that there was more cheese than eggs but what made it inedible was that they also put spring greens on the plate covered in a vinaigrette. The smell was absolutely off putting and nauseating. I don't know if it was just the smell of the vinaigrette or it just didn't blend well with the strong gruyere. Either way the smell made It 100% an appetite killer. Other menu items might be very good but I have not tried them. I sent this back and had no appetite for anything else.  The manger did remove them from the bill, which is expected since we didn't eat any of it, but still charged us for coffee and a juice ($9.75) even after asking what they could do to make it right.

This place is taking breakfast seriously. I don't feel I am being given sub par food for an exorbitant amount of money. If this was a restaurant anywhere else, I would go back again.  Our servers name was Matthew. Although they are very busy, and I can see why, he is a great waiter and very attentive. Awesome service and a True professional.   I must say that the bacon is awesome. Nice big piece of meat very peppery.  The porkchops were amazing as well. The art of cooking eggs is not over looked here. They know the difference between an over medium and an over easy egg.  Would you like toast with your breakfast, don't expect the generic toast that you get in every restaurant across America. Beautiful thick slices of great read. The sourdough bread was absolutely amazing, and I'm from the San Francisco area.The raspberry preserves were amazing and tasted house made.   My hats are off to the manager and the staff at this restaurant. Job very well done. We are very pleased!!!",

The woman behind the counter was super kind to me in talking to me about the different food options they have, as well as getting me a menu to order something directly from the kitchen. I ordered Tossed Cobb and waited a few minutes for it to get prepared. I realized two minutes later that the salad was already available in the refrigerated section, but the woman insisted that I order a freshly-made salad. And it was delectable! Warm chicken on top of crisp vegetables, and enormous - this is the kind of salad I want for $10. Next time, I'll try the True breakfast items that this place is known for.",

We were originally seated at the one of the tall tables and after sitting on a plane for over 5 hours, those chairs are so uncomfortable. A booth became available and we asked to be seated there and they let us. So I was thankful for that.   The food was pretty good. Just your regular breakfast options. We ordered Matt's big breakfast with an extra egg and toast to split. It comes with sausage, bacon, two eggs, home fries and a pancake. I enjoyed everything except the sausage, but my fiance liked it all. Home fries were flavored very well. Eggs were cooked perfectly. I also ordered a side of Mac Salad, which isn't normally available until 11:30, but they had it ready so they let me.  For the amount of people that were there and only 3 guys cooking, the food and time that it came out in was impressive. Our server was very friendly and she was very accommodating. We had a good experience here.",

The plus side is ,it is inside security so you don't have to worry about getting through Security. Which can always be stressful. It is a very popular place as it is on the low B gates and there is a lot of flights out of that side in the morning. I came here with a friend from Denver after coming in from a flight. So we were not rushed. It is a very clean looking place. A great menu to choose from as well.  I ordered the Steak and Eggs, just a note, they do not do poached. So I got scrambled. It was very good and the steak was cooked just the way I like it. My friend got potatoes ,eggs , and bacon. The food was delicious and cooked just right. It was hot when it came out and it came out fast. The only thing that makes me give it 4 stars instead of 5. Was our server. She never brought us more coffee.  Seriously we had to ask 2 other servers for more coffee. Which they brought us and with a smile.  Our server Alexa( I think that was her name). Did not seem too happy to be there and did not want us to have more than one cup of coffee.  The bright side is, Food is great, place is clean, and most all the other servers are awesome.",

We had an hour and a half to kill, so we wandered about the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport unsure what eatery or drinkery to patronize.  Many places were somewhat busy, but Matt's Big Breakfast was spacious enough to draw our attention.  Even though Matt's advertises breakfast, they have a full bar also!  This was our first official day of vacation and decided to celebrate with a cocktail. We found room at the bar and ordered drinks.  I got a Patron Tequila Sunrise, while Joe K ordered a Captain Morgan rum & coke.  They actually offer you choices of premium brand liquors.  Our beverages came in ample sized glasses and they really hit the spot, quenched our thirsts and gave us a mellowing buzz.  Joe was not feeling well and was having a hard time relaxing, so the cocktails were a welcome availability.  Even though our drinks cost $14.00 each, it was a nice splurge that we don't often indulge in.   As for the food, I can't form an opinion on, but other patrons received some delicious looking meals.  And yes, those breakfasts were quite big!  If we were hungry and had more time, I would have definitely tried out their breakfast!",

Dry cabbage is what you get- Tomato soup is pretty good tho it takes an act of Congress to get some oyster crackers to go with it. Customer Service sucks! Had to go up to the bar to get a soda refill not once but twice & to ask for crackers- Waiter no where around- this is the 2nd time we tried this place with the same terrible customer service- don't waste your time- there are plenty of other good places in the terminal to get a good meal with good customer service!",

Overall I've had good service but the last few visits the tables around me have gotten their food first, even if it was the same as my order. All in all I will definitely go back, but don't stop to eat in if you have less than an hour to spend.",

The service is horrific, I asked a simple question of what came with the tuna salad sandwich and the cashier handed me the menu and basically called me an idiot. First of all if you are taking the orders you should know that when a customer is in need of an answer a simple explanation will suffice instead of being completely irrational.  I understand the service industry and as a business owner, I know the level service that needs to be given.  I'm utterly disappointed in this place and lack of knowledge thereof,  it's very unfortunate",

I waited for the hostess to take my name down but he kept acting like people weren't standing and staring at him to say hello. After a few times of this a waiter spoke to everyone which saved me from walking away. The hostess still hadn't said a word so I did and just decided to sit at the bar since something was available. I ordered the French Toast an egg and a Mimosa. So GOOD!!! The ladies at the bar were quick and pleasant, made sure everyone was served and would check back frequently. Everyone else and the food made up for the flustered hostess. Glad I got to visit, I'm sure I will be back!",

There wasn't a host/hostess on duty, so people were cutting in line to get seated before others who had been waiting longer. Anyways, I finally sat down and ordered a cheese omelette and added bacon and sausage. The omelette comes out, and it's a little lukewarm. Ok fine. Then a couple bites into the omelette, I see a mushroom. Hmm. Maybe it just snuck in. Nope. I peeled back the omelette and saw a ton of mushrooms. I really dislike mushrooms. If this omelette is supposed to come with mushrooms, list them as an ingredient on the menu! The menu literally said your choice of cheese and that's it. No mention of mushrooms. Unpleasant surprise for sure. The potatoes were cold too. It was a disappointing breakfast to say the least, but the service was good.",

But the trouble had started with getting seated and having to fight with a father and a little girl for our seats because they thought they were sitting there even though they never got seated by anyone. After that we ordered and ended up waiting 20 minutes for our food. I ordered the 5 platter plate (breakfast sandwich), it was really good. My cousin ordered a omelet and loved it. My sister ordered the salami scramble and it wasn't good, I could make better eggs. My brother ordered the big breakfast and ate it fast.The only thing that we hated was the potatoes. The potatoes in general were fine but they were sauteed in rosemary or something foul and were just nasty. The food was decently priced and you get what you pay for. Wouldn't recommend for a quick meal. Nothing special.",

    "text": "To preface this: I actually really enjoy Matt's Big Breakfast - the food tends to be great quality, and service is fine. I just do not like the customer service at THIS Matt's (at the airport).  Tl;dr - poor customer service will cost you (both reputation and cash).  My wife and I gave our name to the host (who was this older, very curt fellow) and moved about 4 feet away from the entrance to make space for others to pass through and/or add themselves to the waiting list. The host told us it would be about 15-20 minutes but hopefully faster.  My wife and I then started having a conversation off to the side while still listening for our name to be called. Meanwhile there was a really outgoing waiter who was very personable serving people just on the other side of the barrier we were standing by.  As we are standing there, I spot about 5 groups get called in, so I figure we are getting close. It's been about 12 minutes at this point. I go to check the list, and there's a lot more names crossed off the list AFTER us. I mean about 15 names scratched off AFTER us. No way we heard him call that many names for people. It honestly just looked like he was arbitrarily crossing people off the list. And indeed our name was crossed off, but I decided to double check with him anyway.  I ask the host if he called our name (I swear he did not), and he said he did but we did not respond. His tone was incredibly rude, too - like he was gloating about it. We were literally 4 feet from his stand. What?  At this point, I realize it might have been possible that we missed our name being called as the outgoing waiter was really loud, but please, if you see us 4 feet away, just call it again to make sure. Better yet - switch the host and the waiter. No way would we have missed his call. The original host was mumbling by comparison, and he looked like he hated being a host.  The best the host offered was to put us back on the list, but at that point, I had no faith in his ability to be courteous or to call our names when our turn was up, so we just left. Your time is better spent at an establishment that will at least try (and not just rest on the laurels of being a known restaurant).",

Had to drop my kiddo off at the airport super duper early today. I always wait at the gate with her. I grabbed my usual coffee from the Refuge and they are always awesome! Decided to grab a sandwich to go from this place and walked up to the \"to go\" counter and the waitress who was prepping said and I quote \"I have to check to see if we are open\" and walked away. The gentlemen who was in line with me said they open @ 5:30 (it was 5:30) so they are open. There were 6 people working, bartender, host, cook, mgr and a couple other people. Why comeeeee the waitress never came back, no one acknowledged the growing line of folks waiting to order. I walked over to the bartender who was actually taking food orders for the folks who sat at the bar and politely asked if someone was going to take our orders and she said without one glance that the waitress will be over in a min. Mind you we had been standing there for 7 mins, every single person that worked there looked over at the ever growing to go line. I/we watched the waitress go get water for a table, coffee then slowly walk to get a coke! Reallyyyy folks... really! After almost 10 mins I was like let's bounce. As I walked by the waitress was taking the food order of the one table she had. Everyone else was sitting at the bar! Still not one person working there went over to the \"to go\" line.   How very very rude. This  place needs to get it the heck together and revisit their customer service etiquette. The shift manager was there too! Wow just wow.    Done and done....never again!",

The eggs had so much cheese in it, the smell of it paired with the vinaigrette was very off putting it turned our stomach so much so early in the morning that we couldn't even think of ordering anything else.

What else can I say about BACON!!! BACON ROCKS and the bacon here is a little thick, crispy, and very tasty! The home fries are seasoned and cooked with friend onions so if you don't like onions might want to let them know.   Our server was Tim and he was AWESOME.

Under normal circumstances fine, but this is an airport where people need to catch flights. We had to walk out because after the wait for the table, and after the time it would take to order and settle in when we finally would have received our food we would have had to leave to board.

No wait, their table was ready.  No waffles ( or any sweet & savory) and no mushrooms. Antone, who originally took our name, was a pleasure. The gal he was working with (no name tag) actually was yawning while talking to us. Might be a little thing but not a good first impression. We waited 24 minutes for our food and I had to send my pancakes back because they were burned on the bottom. My husband's breakfast burrito was mediocre at best (his words) It was a Sunday morning at 9am.",

    "text": "It was like we didn't exist. It took around 10 minutes of standing waiting to be seen. We actually watched people come and go behind us because no one was there to greet us. Eventually, somebody came.   The first thing that struct me as odd when we finally got seated was that we could not modify ANYTHING If I wanted a waffle on the side, our waiter said I had to buy another full meal that had the waffle. They wouldn't even give my Mother the option of removing her onions from a meal someone said was optional. Very disappointing.   Aside from that, the food wasn't bad actually. Up until we noticed my Mother had hair in her potatoes. She was only half way finished her food when we informed our waiter. He said he would take it to his manager and return shortly. So while we wait, I search my food like a madman hoping I don't find anything, resulting in me not even wanting to eat anymore. The waiter returned and said that it wasn't hair, it was only a scratch in the plate.   Really...? A scratch that can move and land on other food with a push of a fork? Right  He also returned empty handed. If it was just a scratch in the plate, why didn't he give us the food back? My Mom left not only still hungry, but offended as well. The food didn't take too well to our stomachs either...  Thank you very much, for being terrible. We will NEVER eat here again.",
