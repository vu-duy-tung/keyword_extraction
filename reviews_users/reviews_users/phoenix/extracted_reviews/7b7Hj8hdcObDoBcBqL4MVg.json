The people here always seem to be great people (typically an older crowd), and the staff is awesome. People come here to have a good time with friends, grab a drink, listen to music and be happy. Oh, and the live music here is perfect for any night of the week!",

When we got there a band were playing country and western type music and they were getting everyone involved in the dancing and having fun.  It was a brilliant atmosphere and once again the decor was brill - although the venue was a little small.  Downsides were - bartenders a bit rude (maybe just busy) and the excellent dancers that kept hogging the dance space and not letting anyone have a go.  Yes - we know you're good but let the other patrons have a go!  This place is a must must must!",

This place always has live music and they take suggestions from the crowd which is fun. It's tiny in there, but I think it adds to the atmosphere. There's all sorts of fun things all over the walls that are cool to look at and the drinks are cheap. I would be really shocked if you didn't have a good time here, even if you aren't that into country music. It's just very western/old school Arizona feeling and a fun change from the rest of the bars in Old Town (it's also sort of away from the rest of the bars). When I graduated from college my dad, my stepmom and I all went to Saba's, bought boots, put them on, and walked over to Rusty Spur to get our drink on. I highly suggest you do the same ;)",

He had me at the p word.   This is just a down and dirty saloon of epic proportions. Very friendly place with locals and tourists alike, folksy singers and a laid back vibe. Its super friendly, the staff is fast and the crowd runs the gamut from post dinner suits to cowboys. Kind of like heaven.   Note to singer: get your blues folks and rock and roll folks straight.....Robert Johnson was a blues man and I don't care how much I've had to drink, not buying your story about him being and influential rock and roll pioneer.

We have been around the world, currently living in the pix area, and these by far are the worst nachos we have ever had.  More than half the stale chips had nothing on them.

We got here around 730 and definitely beat the entire crowd haha but by around 930/10 it was packed  The band takes request and they also make sure to let the crowd know that they take tips haha it's well worth it though!",

Essentially the guy behind the bar was too busy talking to one of his regulars and it seemed like it was a real effort to serve us. No small talk and literally threw the change down on the bar and carried on talking to his buddy. Made us feel like a piece of crap on the bottom of his shoe. Pity as he had some really cool T shirts but instead of buying I voted with my feet.  Obviously doesn't like visitors.",

However, I've been going to RS for years and tonight was treated quite badly. When I noticed that a very intoxicated girl had spilled her drink on the dance floor (and waited about 10 minutes), I finally brought it to the attention of the security guy (who happened to be sitting right in front of the spill). I suggested (at first politely) that he might want to attend to the spill and avoid a possible \"slip and fall\" lawsuit because I enjoyed going there and it would be a shame if it was closed down for something like that. He very sarcastically replied, \"Thank you for telling me how to do my job.\" Yes, I then replied with a bit of profanity which I instantly apologized for and he did not accept. The profanity was not in any way directed at him, but rather the possible consequences of not cleaning up the spill... \"you could wind up with a f*#@king lawsuit.\" Instead, he became instantly defensive and I just left. The guy at the door was very nice and polite. My intention was only to help.",

    "text": "I heard a few of my colleagues had gone to the small western dive bar for after dinner drinks. This place is located in Old Scottsdale AZ. It has a charm to it and quite frankly a place people should go to visit especially if you are from out of town. All types of people visit this place. A 1 man band was playing some country western songs with his guitar and everyone was just singing along. What really blew me away was when the bartender started singing from a wireless mic behind the bar. So the guitar man performs and this bartender,  his name was Jimmy, sees to the tune was perfect pitch and harmony. When a Johnny Cash song started playing a signature jail house song, I thought he sang it better!! This bartender did not miss a beat taking orders from people while singing!!! Amazing! Now some of the country songs had a lot of double meaning so if you are timid, don't go. If you are about having fun and are not ahy, this is a great place to be. He pours his drinks very suitably, and he is a nice guy to boot! The only thing is, if you have a nice woman, be prepared for the locals to chat to her, and wanna buy her drinks. The guys are very aggressive but will not disrespect your girl if she politely declines. They have quite a selection of beers, and they have a walk in ice box! Simply put, you gotta try this place no matter what!",

The burger could have been frozen, the cheese thin and lacking and the bacon and the buns were room temperature and not toasted and was so small that I would not recommend that burger to anyone.  The pork tamale with green sauce was 20x hotter than the chicken tamale with the same green filling and the beef tamale was dry and well just ok. Overall the tamales were dry and that's why they recommended the pork sauce \"gravy\"  on them because they are dry without it.  My recondition is to just get drinks there.

Tasty, moist and decent size. I was quite impressed!  The place itself looks like a fun place to hang at if you're ever there in the evening when a band is playing or there's music. The decor and the service is very inviting.   Great job Rusty Spur!",

It small but delivers a huge punch of authentic fun and it has dollar bills staples to the walls that people sign their names to making a statement of \"I was here!\"   Very casual, boots welcomed and if you don't have boots you can buy some next door. Old town is great. The free trolley stops directly outside Rusty's door so you can mossy on and around the old town area.    I did manage to have a few buzzard wings and some cowboy chili. The food is fairly good but the ambiance is insanely great. Day or night a live honky tonky guitar player is on stage and not too loud so you can carry a conversation as well.

In the spring there are lots of tourists at the Spur, so if you are a local they'll love you even more.

No matter what's going on outside the doors on the streets of Old Town; whether it be crowded during spring training or 115 degrees and dead, it's always the same inside the Rusty Spur. The moment you step foot through the doors, you're immediately transformed into a time warp when John Waynes ruled the city and two stepping was the only dancing worth doing in this desert.   This is one of my favorite saloons in Old Town. Here, it doesn't matter how much your outfit cost, what kind of purse you have, what your wearing or who you're with. As long as you're ready to have a good time in a crowded setting with plenty of live country music, you're welcome. Here, everyone treats you like a friend and nobody gets upset if their drink spills a little because someone two stepped right into their arm. Here, it doesn't matter if it's 1:00 PM or 1:00 AM because the atmosphere will be the same with most likely the same cover Country band performing. This is truly a gem in Scottsdale. There's a reason it's been around since the beginning and will most likely stick around until the end.",

I waited in line to get in and when it was my turn, I was let through the door.  When I turned around, I noticed some of my friends didn't get in so they were still at the door.  I went back to the door to ask them if they wanted me to get them something at the bar and the bouncer flipped out yelling and swearing at me. I was confused because I hadn't done anything to him. He physically turned me around and shoved me hard from behind almost causing me to fall.  For perspective I am a petite woman. 5'1 and I weigh 100 pounds.  I was wearing high heels and a dress.  I was embarrassed and upset to have been treated that way.  My husband saw what happened and when he approached us the bouncer was yelling and swearing telling my husband that \"I'll throw you the F out of here right now!\" I have no idea what set this guy off, but I recommend some coaching before you guys end up with a lawsuit from him taking things too far. I was not hurt but the force with which he pushed me was completely out of line. I have attached a photo so that you know who it was.",

Stopped in on a Monday around noon and to our surprise all the tables and bar were  already full. The place is small with about 10 tables and maybe 10 seats at the bar.  We stood waiting less than 5 minutes when we could get a seat at the bar. I ordered a cadillac margarita and the very nice bartender knew how to make a perfect quality drink (justifies the price too lol!) I ordered the tumbleweed salad with chicken and hubby ordered taco salad with chicken. Both great. There was live entertainment and the singer at times  sounded exactly like Willie Nelson. It was fun to look and read all the memorabilia on the walls. Really was a great,  comfortable friendly place to have a drink and/or eat. The Bartender and server were outstanding.",

They will get the True Old Town Scottsdale experience with good ol' country music, dancing, and cocktails. It is great for all ages. I have come here multiple times with my parents, friends, co-workers, you name it (21+, of course). They have live music most (if not all) nights but definitely on Friday and Saturday nights. The drinks are inexpensive and it has a divey feel (my favorite). The only reason for the 4 stars is that it is very small so on weekend nights, you're usually rubbing up against people and it can sometimes take a while to get a drink or go to the restroom but other than that, it is definitely a 'must go' in my book! I know that i'll be back again soon!  P.S. Come here after you've eaten because they don't serve food!",

The bar is still fun, but poo-poo on them for the new Arizona no-smoking law.  We had a hilarious female performer on our first day there who kept calling my friends out by making them sing and dance.  That's so friggin cool of her.  (I'll update this when I double-check what her name is.)  Our ever-familiar bartenders were no longer working there.  Sadly, our favorite bartender, Thelma, quit working there five months ago.  She was one of the folks who would take care of our loud, rowdy, alcoholic crew.  At any rate, still a fun place, but -1* for no more Thelma and no more smoking.  This place is still going to remain an annual destination even without those things, but what a shame to have them gone. **************************************************************************** I can't wait to go back to Scottsdale for Spring Training and hit up our hole, the Rusty Spur.  I'm heading out there and I look forward to the bartenders and live band for my fourth year.  The bartenders are awesome and remember my name from year to year.  That's pretty cool, since we're only there for six days every year in March.  Enjoy the chill vibe inside.  This will be updated again upon my return this year.",

They have live music every afternoon and night seven days a week. It's locally owned, has been around forever. You're always greeted with a a warm welcome from the servers, band and patrons. The atmosphere is great and dollar bills cover the walls and ceiling. Little known fact... every year they have a party where they take down all the dollars, Rusty Spur then matches the amount and it all gets donated to a local Charity. Yee haw!",

The Spur Burger was really good but it really needs a sturdier bun for the size of the burger and toppings...The bottom bun was soggy. Maybe they should place the lettuce and/ or the onion on the bottom bun to keep it  from getting soggy...fries were very good and seasoned perfectly for my taste...the bartender/ waitress could have been a bit friendlier. Enjoyed the entertainment...would definitely return for lunch when we're in the Valley...",

It looks and feels like a real saloon even down to a couple of the bar stools.  We were waited on immediately.  The food was good and the server attentive in the beginning but as the crowds started rolling in we virtually lost our server.  We finally had to go to the bar to pay it.  As I mentioned the place is small and gets packed.  It's hard to hear at your own table when others are trying as hard as they might to be heard by the groups at their own table.  People end up trying to talk over the top of each other.  Thus, noisy.  Been there, done that and probably won't go back.",

He asked something that, with the music and loud conversations going on, I didn't hear, and asked him , \"what did you say?\"  His very aggravated response was to say to the guy at the bar, left of me, \"I'm sure you heard me, so I'm sure this guy did too!\"  Never been treated so poorly in any bar, restaurant, etc!  Told him to keep 'em! Never will darken their door again!  Unbelievable!   We are locals and have brought friends to this place several times before. When we first walked in, I got a hug from one of the servers, obviously happy to see us.    This place has been there since 1951. Perhaps it's time for it to go away!  Visitors beware!!!",

Well we didn't have a chance to decide - someone comes out of the bar and says \"Come on In -  I'll introduce you to everyone\".  We follow this man into the bar - he tells the performer that Sarah & Matt are here in which he works our names into the song to say hi to us. This place is TINY. Max - 30 seats including the bar. It was a great mix of people - we were able to sit at the bar and watch people dancing and enjoying the afternoon. It's an interesting place that make you feel as if you are in the \"wild west\" not in Scottsdale.

    "text": "Lets just say this is a tourist type bar, but a pretty cool place to take out of town guests.  The food has always been good and reasonable prices.  The live music is great.  Took my adult daughter there for lunch today, as she was in town visiting and to walk around Old Scottsdale.  It will now be the last time I go there.  My question:  (to the bartender) Excuse me maam, is there any idea on how long for our food?  We have been waiting twenty-five minutes.  (order was a burger w/o-rings and a ten piece bar-b-que chicken wings).  Answer:  This is a small place and I only have one guy and one grill, yours is the next up.\"  WRONG ANSWER!  How about: \"Let me check on it\" or \"Oh we are a bit backed up right now - let me check.\"  At this time we counted.  Eight people eating food, the rest drinking beverages.  31 people in the place (which was full).  We also timed the food arrival from our question, 7 more minutes. I would have appreciated when we ordered her letting us know it would be this long.  I had never waited, even when crowded more than 15 minutes for food here.  The \"flip\" attitude of the bartender ruined any further visits from me with my visitors, and soured all my fun times I have had here.  Kind of feel bad, but, there is no reason to speak to a paying customer like that.",

Nonetheless, we were due for a cold beer, spotted some characters smoking outside of this bar, heard the live music, and trotted on in.  The crowd was a real mixed bag which made for some great people-watching. The dictionary definition of \"Sweaty Betty\" was cutting a rug to the country western sounds of the Psychobilly Rodeo Band. The band was infinitely entertaining and did not spare us commentary on its disdain for Kenny Chesney and other feel-good country-pop monstrosities.  Best of all, our need for edible smoke was satisfied since they sell beef jerky at the bar. We chowed down on some Mesquite Black Canyon Jerky, swaggled our brewskis, tapped our feet, and soaked up the party atmosphere of this fun little cowboy bar.",

Some backwater town outside of the Phoenix metro area, perhaps - but Scottsdale? The Arizona city known by outsiders for it's ritzy nature does have it's history though, and that history is steeped in the Wild West. So while at first sight, Rusty Spur may seem out of place, it shouldn't be a major surprise.  I'm a Massachusetts native, but lived in Arizona for two years. Out of the bars I went to, the Rusty Spur was easily the most memorable. I'll fully admit that I have an affinity towards the Wild West era (Cowboys and Native Americans alike!), so rather than deal with a typically modern Scottsdale area bar, the Rusty Spur is a welcome establishment.  The place has good food, great drink, and damn fine music. If you're into anything country, whether it be the music or the history, you're likely to enjoy the Spur.  I no longer drink, but if I'm ever in the Scottsdale area again I'll stop by the Rusty Spur for a bite to eat and to soak up the atmosphere. To me, there are few places like the Rusty Spur in all of the Phoenix metro area - it is a must visit place if you want to grab a drink in a True Cowboy Saloon without driving out to the sticks.",

Salty bartender who sings from behind the bar and sassy guitarist/singer up on the stage were both great.  The pour was strong and reasonably priced.

If you know what you're getting yourself into, you're likely to love it also.  It's TINY. I've often wondered if it's among the smallest bars in the state or even country. You'll have to wade through a crowd of people on weekend evenings, some dancing, to get to the bar, which has no draft beer. Really. Unless you're a regular, service won't be particularly friendly, but drinks are strong and cheap. The people watching and the live music is why you're here anyway.  The Friday & Saturday night band, Psychobilly Rodeo Band, is unlike anything you've ever heard before. You'll be jamming out to \"All Summer Long\" or \"American Pie,\" and suddenly you'll hear, \"Tip the f%$king band!\" or \"Show us your t*tties!\" It's truly a blast, and you'll witness people from 21 to 80 dancing and singing, locals, horrified foreign tourists, and bewildered businessmen alike.   Trust me, it's worth at the very least one drink. By the way, they're serious - tip the band.",

We were only in town for a night and weren't able to get out and enjoy Scottsdale until around midnight. We had to find a place that would be open late, and something unique to the area. After perusing Yelp reviews (and all of the booty barstool pics) I was sold!   We were instantly surprised at how small the space was, but the decor is charming and we still had plenty of space to move about. Happened to catch the last half hour of a live music set. And again, country music isn't my thing.....but I am a NC girl for life and I couldn't help but jump up and down when they started playing Devil Went Down to Georgia   The drinks weren't expensive, not cheap either. It was worth it for the experience. Can't speak for the food because we didn't order anything.

I got tired of being thirsty so i went up and got the pitcher of water from the bar and brought it back to my table so I could wash the sandwich down. Bingo, immediate service, they almost sprinted over to recover the pitcher of water. He did not fill my water but did take the pitcher back to the bar.  I was getting ready to buy a few shirts, a few more beers and listen to live music, but taking the water away made me feel not welcomed.... So we left.",

The big TV is a homage to the present, while the decor is a throwback to the past. It is pretty much a must check out for a beer or two if your in the area and like bars and history.

Sometimes it's a very entertaining show with bartender participation, other times is more mediocre. No matter how the place swings - on the busy side or more mellow - it's a fun time. I've only had basic beer and some well drinks here, but I like the beer selection. I was a little put off walking in there for a bachelorette party when we got dirty looks for being dressed up, but the staff was still nice to us (the patrons gave us the stink eye).

It is located in the old bank and the vault that once held money now keeps the beer cold. They have live music every day and never charge a cover. They serve lunch, but plan on eating dinner elsewhere. The best time to be here is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night when the Psychobilly Rodeo Band plays. They are great! If you are easily offended this is not the bar for you. The place is tiny and gets packed quickly. The good thing is that if anyone even thinks about getting out of hand they are quickly removed. This is a great place to day drink, night drink, well anytime drink. Go and see the last real cowboy saloon in Scottsdale.",

We finally got to visit here and I must say it was a good time. The bartender was awesome and made the drinks super strong. We went when there was a guy on a banjo playing country covers promoting his cd. He was hilarious going back n forth with the audience, he knows how to entertain a crowd. So much random, cool things hanging on the wall, which gives it a nice western saloon ambience. The place was packed so we just pulled up and shared a table with a kind couple of snowbirds who regularly come to this bar. Had some great drinks with great conversation, just how I like it. Not sure if I would go here with people my own age (20's) but it was fun with my 40+ friends.",

Every bar is a cookie cutter copy of the others.   The Rusty Spur makes me think that I am in Austin.  Too bad it is a little far away from the usual stomping grounds.  This bar always has live music, and cheep beers.  It is a great spot to mix up an evening on the town.  The staff is friendly, and I think they encourage stumbling drunks to yell YEHAWW!  If you are from out of town, and want a truly cowboy type experience while out in Scottsdale skip Saddle Ranch, because that is manufactured in Hollywood, and skip the Coach House (unless it is a holiday) because it is too packed.  The Rusty Spur always seems to have the perfect amount of people having a good time.   And when everyone is having a good time, then I am certain to have a good time.  Check your attitude at the door and listen to a solid Arizona country cover band any night of the week.",

Well, I've come to make this request to a higher power.  The negative reviews about The Rusty Spur make my head swim like it would after a pull of Mezcal straight from the bottle.   This place is tip-fucking-top.  You don't want to be pressured to tip the band?  Then pay a cover.  Would that make ya feel all better?  No cover to enjoy a genuine Texas (read: \"real\") country band?  Holy smokes, they will even do covers of Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green.  Go to any other shite bar in the city and ask them if they know that.    The place is tiny, which lends to its charm.  This place is STRAIGHT out of Luckenbach and these suburbanites don't even know the characteristics of an 'outlaw country' bar.  Waylon and Willie would be proud of this place.  Plus, they serve Shiner Bock in a bottle.  Unreal.    The dance floor, which is a misnomer, more like a shuffle floor is absolutely legit in accordance with the rules of a Texas dance hall, except for the fact that you bump into tables instead of only other dancers.  Go watch Urban Cowboy and tell me that you need your dance space.  Get over it.  .... and .... AND! ... \"Beans\" in the chili?  WTF?  This ain't Canada.  Hell, this aint even Ohio!  Beans should NEVER disgrace a proper pot of chili.  Jesus.  What the reviewer who mentioned that has just informed me is that they make their chili proper.  But I'd never know because I go in here to hoot n holler n get rowdy with the rest of the crowd ... drink a Shiner and dance a little two-step to Merle ... not stuff my face like a tourist.  Christ.  I'm in no way a regular here, but this place is one of the very few legitimate country bars, not only in Phoenix, but worldwide.  I've been in enough to know.  It should be regarded very highly for its genre.",

And the barstools shaped as chubby cheerleader asses never get old. I have never hit the place at lunch hour, but I will update when I do. Gotta try those Buzzard Wings they sell up. Food only serves until 4. Remember that. But so many choices nearby if you miss it. They sell great Scottsdale Tees and Hoodies, too. For the holiday giving time.

And by local I refer to the large group of Scots in the bar dressed in Western wear having a HELL of a time in this \"wee, bonnie bar\"  The place is tiny but lively with good live music, cheap drinks and a crowd that likes to have a good time. This is a nice alternative to a lot of the other places in Scottsdale. Definitely a place I need to hit more often for some live country music and definitely a place to bring out of town relatives and friends.  Good times.",

    "text": "Our vacation side trip on Saturday, 25 October 2014 to Scottsdale included a stop at the oldest saloon in Arizona. It was here, at the Rusty Spur Saloon, that we also experienced the oldest scam in the bar business.  My girlfriend ordered their special Moscow Mule made with Titos vodka. Sitting at the table directly in front of the bartender, she noticed him pour vodka from a bottle with a green label which he had pulled from the well at the bar. Titos, or favorite vodka, has a distinctive brown label.  When the waitress brought the drink in their signature copper mug, she was asked if the vodka was Titos. Her response was yes. I went to the restroom and on return had a direct view of the rail from which he pulled the bottle. No Tito's bottle with a brown label. Only the rail bottles of alcohol. And there it was. The bottle of vodka with a green label. The waitress saw me looking, and from the look on her face she was aware I had discovered the truth.  It is a shame that a bar with such a long history in Old Town Scottsdale is ruined by the blatant dishonesty of a bartender. How many guests had this bartender and The Rusty Spur Saloon ripped off over their tenure in Scottsdale in the name off the almighty dollar? I will write all of the review websites, the county council of Scottsdale, the tourism board of Scottsdale, and the owner of the saloon",

    "text": "When Lindsey recommended that we go to the rusty spur, I was pretty excited. A real saloon! Maybe I can get a Sasparilla? Not exactly... But I did get hit on ruthlessly by 60 plus year old Canadians, danced a little to a sweet rendition of John Denver and had some whiskey shots with fellow yelpers.  It reminds me a bit of Nashville in that it is a honky tonk that's much smaller and much cleaner than any giant country bar you would find in Texas. The drinks are pretty strong, which I can appreciate, and the bartender was definitely surly. To be fair, we came in like a whirlwind of 25 half drunk maniacs. There is definitely some eye candy there, good tunes and who doesn't love a place with dollar bills stapled all over the walls?  Not a bad spot if you are in Scottsdale. And certainly better than going to a Vegas style club IMHO.",

    "text": "This was an awesome little bar with some not so awesome service.    Rusty Spur would easily be a 5-star joint if we weren't treated like sh*t by the waitress/bartender.  When a friend mentioned how cute the menu was, she was told by said waitress/bartender that she better not slip it in her purse and that if she wanted it, it'd cost her $3. Dude...seriously? Assuming your customers are thieves is not cool. The musician making fun of New Yorkers and calling us out to tip an extra $20 (after at least $10 was put in the tip jar) because we \"had plenty\" was kind of BS too.    On the bright side? It's a really cool space with kick-ass customers (not counting us). Did we catch it on a bad day? Maybe...If the place attracts cool patrons, it can't be half bad.",

    "text": "Scottsdale's Last Real Cowboy Saloon... I totally thought I'd reviewed Rusty Spur before as I've been more times than I can count.  I'll agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this place - it's laid back, un-pretentious, hole-in-the-wall, and fun!  I'm not a huge country music fan either, but when I come to Rusty Spur, I love it!  You can't help but smile and have a great time at this place!  If I don't start out here at Happy Hour, I end the night here whenever I'm out in Old Town.    I'm left with a souvenir tank top that Jared bought me in his drunken state the other night when we were hanging at the Spur.  It says: ALL JACKED UP Big Time Since 1951 RUSTY SPUR SALOON Scottsdale, AZ  It's cute, but not quite as wonderful as entering into the doors of the Rusty Spur and leaving your troubles behind to enjoy the country music and cowboys that surround you!",

The walls are adorned with dollar bills, various license places, and other miscellaneous items. The crowd was a bit older, but very welcoming! Russ was the soloist.  And when he sang The Cowboy Rides away, I knew I would be back. He solicits tips (whether you think he is good or not) by having a regular come to each table with an \"offering\" plate...Lol. I thought I was in church. One worker was serving the whole place.",
