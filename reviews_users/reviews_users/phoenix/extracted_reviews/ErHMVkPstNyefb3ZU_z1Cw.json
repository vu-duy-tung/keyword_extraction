At 6:30 on Sunday night I walked to Z Pizza to get 4 slices of pizza because it was faster than ordering a full pizza. The slices were awful. They were old. They cost $13. They were only barely warmed in the pizza oven.   If you don't see the pizzas come out of the oven then don't expect them to be good. Lesson learned.",

(That was only for a FYI purpose, not because we wanted gluten free). When she placed the order the person let her know that something we got as a topping was not gluten free, which was totally OK with us. She got a call back later from another person letting her know the same info. That is a good customer service touch and we both wanted to give Z Pizza a shout out for taking care of their customers. Plus...their pizzas are really yummy!",

This caused lots of waiting time as the delivery boy cleared it up. They honoured the 2-for-1 so we were happy. Pretty good pizza. I like the crust. The curry chicken yam rustica and the Mediterranean were my favourites. Nothing super amazing but definitely better than your run-of-the-mill pizza joint. A great price if you get a promo deal.",

At first it was annoying that I would place the order online with explicit instructions for where my apartment was located only to find that the hippie delivery guy from Z would call my cell phone (sometimes I'd hear it ring and sometimes not) for further information.  Hijinx invariably ensue as I verbally administer the same instructions over the phone.  Now I just come to expect that when I order delivery from Z Pizza the guy who brings it to me will have blazed one up in the car on the half mile ride over to my place and will need some help getting to the door.  And then, the order surprise! Until they fixed the online ordering system you truly never knew what would actually be in your custom calzone.  Now it's at least got the right ingredients, although they interpret them a little loosely sometimes (last night, for example, I requested sauce, sauce, and more sauce and they gave me only one tiny cup).   I love the calzone with wheat crust (I love that you can get wheat at all), the turkey sandwich with cranberry, and my husband loves the Santa Fe pizza (which I personally find a little revolting).  The food is tasty and they bring it to my house.  I like that.  It's better than ordering from Pizza Megalopolis or some other insanely corporatized chain.  Even though Z is a chain they \"keep it real\" and operate like a mom and pop.  Plus they keep our local Granola Crowd employed so they can turn around and spend their cash at other local spots.    Gotta love the Z.",

I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?  I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.  Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today.   Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY  This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.  I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.  I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!  Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung.   Did I just say that?",

I ordered the Italian, which has a hefty portion of artichoke hearts and black olives and I would have devoured the entire thing on my own had it not been for that pesky husband of mine.  The gluten free crust is an extra $3.00...be forewarned if your hardcore about keeping gluten free though. They aren't very careful it seems about cross contamination and I'm not positive, but think they might have used the same cutter on the regular pizza's as mine and there was flour everywhere. Kind of defeats the purpose of eating a gluten free pizza IMO, but I'm willing to take that kind of risk. I like to live on the edge.",

The \"buffalo\" wings had no buffalo sauce aside from one wing and they were rubbery and had no flavor. The pizza I had requested be made fresh but that would not cure the cardboard tasting pizza with what tasted like old ingredients. By far the worst $22 I ever spent on pizza. Another over rated disgusting downtown pizza place.",

I was ready to order and the girl that helped me seemed like I was bothering her. I order two slices of pizza with no drink. (I wasn't not aware of their specials.) I found a table and waited for my food. When the girl came with my food she dropped the food off and walked away. After the same thing happened with my friends, they asked why I didn't get the lunch special (that was two dollars cheaper for the same food including a drink). This made me angry that the girl who took my order did not mention this.",

They are nice people and the service is pretty great, which earns most of its ratings.  Pizzas are kind of expensive, though. Their salads aren't really all that special.  Also, figuring out their menu online is impossible. You have to sign up just to look at it, and honestly I don't need any more emails about anything in my inbox.  I also have spent at least $5 on a meal at least a dozen times, and I haven't forgotten about giving them my phone number but my points towards a free pizza don't add up. I wish this was somehow fixed because I feel I would be close to some free pizza, but alas I will likely continue to eat here.",

And of course I love their crust with the bit of garlic at the end.  It really made my day.   I also had the Napoli for the second time.  I think this might be my favorite...wait no, the Casablanca is my favorite...no, the bbq chicken...DOH! Seriously, I've never had this type of pizza, meaning thin crust gourmet.  I'm used to the big, pan crust pizza pies.  This is a treat, though it will not replace my love for pies.  It will be a new love affair. Last thing, I'm continually impressed with the freshness of their ingredients.  I've never had tomatos so sweet or mushrooms that I would eat by themselves.  Awesome stuff.",

I really didn't want to order close to $20 worth of food to get delivered, but as I perused our folder full of menus that had delivery service, I started to salivate when I started reading the Z Pizza menu. It's a very colorful, attractive menu, and had a bright yellow sticker that said \"free delivery\" (as opposed to Mamma Mia, whom I love, but $2 delivery and $10 minimum, well, anyway, I'm digressing).  What to get, what to get, it sucks when you're just that hungry and all these pretty combinations of toppings jump out at you saying, 'pick me,' Little tomatoes with white gloves were high kicking like Rockettes with their arms linked with Mr. Mozzarella and his top hat and monocle. Wait, that was Mr. Peanut, anyway...So I decided on the Provence, which was described as having artichokes, tomatoes, capers and garlic sauce, in addition to the mozzarella and regular tomato sauce. I love me some capers.  It seemed a queer combination, but I love all these ingredients and was eager to have a little adventure. I called in my order, and the girl on the phone recognized me from the bar, and we chatted about the pizza, decided I should have a little truffle oil thrown on there as well. What arrived, still hot, and perfectly baked, was one of the tastiest pizzas I've had delivered in a while. The crust was so crunchy and the truffle oil had soaked into it, so it was like its own separate hors d'ouevre after I made my way to what I would normally call the pizza butt.  The toppings were tasty, fresh, and the combination was truly a treat. I don't know about the garlic sauce, it was a bit too much, but maybe in a lesser quantity the flavor would have melded and not been so obtrusive. I was a happy Kitty, and the next day, it reheated like a champ for a little lunch revisited. Good stuff, that Z Pizza. Oh, and my favorite was the little Kitty face drawn on the side of the box next to my phone number.  Nice touch.",

A girl was available to take my order then she put my slice on a plate. I asked her to please heat it up she said it just came out of the oven, I touched it with it was cold. She then pitched a huge attitude grabbing the slice with tongs placing it in the oven for barely 45 seconds. Again grabbing it out with the tongs angrily, toppings falling on the floor. Needless it was still cold and half the slice I ordered. Get rid of her.",

Oh and to top it off; they deliver.Can't beat that.   My favorite pizza here is Casablanca. I could eat entire one by myself and I am not ashamed of that. Hahaha...  It is a great place in my neighborhood when you want good pizza delivered to your home. Sometimes, you just want to stay in and enjoy comfort of your home in a company of good pizza.   Cuztomer service is grean and place is really neat if you prefer to get out there and eat!",

    "text": "I am surprised by some of the negative reviews for Z-Pizza. I've been coming here since I was in high school and have never had a bad experience. They have great lunch specials, and the ingredients always taste fresh. It's also pretty reasonably priced for what you get. I usually order a small pizza and a salad, which comes out to $12-15 depending on what I order, and I can get 2 meals out of it depending on how hungry I am.  My favorite pizzas are the Santa Fe, Chicken Sausage and Arugula, and American. There's also a good selection of toppings if you want to build your own. I love that you can also get any pizza on gluten free crust, which is actually really good. The salads are great too, especially with the chipotle ranch dressing.  I've also recently become a big fan of their delivery. You can order online, there's not a delivery charge, and there's no minimum order. It always seems to come pretty quickly.   My only dislikes are some of the non-pizza items. I got an order of Parmesan Flatbread Sticks a week or two ago and they kind of tasted just like plain pizza crust. The wings are also pretty bad. They don't really have any sauce and have absolutely no spice or flavor.",

Mind you, they charge $6.50 for a pint, which is already a little high, but worth it as it is homemade.   I frequently order from here and always make sure to get a pint of the ice cream. This last time, I placed my order as usual and what do they deliver to my house?... A pint of Ben & Jerry's! For $6.50!?! I voiced my frustration to one of the employees who said he would have the owner call me.   This morning, I spoke with Mark, the owner, who was completely rude. He stated that Z Pizza does not advertise the former Pink Spot product (Well Mark, perhaps you should tell your employees to stop telling customers that that is what it is), and that they have the right to set whatever prices they choose.   You're absolutely right, Mark... You can set whatever price you choose for a \"grocery store\" product. I can also choose to save my money as a customer and take it elsewhere. And to be completely honest, your pizza is just \"ok\" and still twice as expensive as ordering from Papa John's... Who btw, delivers in half the time it takes your employees.   Z Pizza just lost another regular customer.",

To their credit both registers were manned, but when it came to be my turn, the cashier (Asian female) decided she didn't want to do any more work and just wandered off. When she decided to come back, she spent the next 15 minutes chatting to her friend on her phone. Eventually she decided to serve me and got the order wrong. Gee thanks for nothing lady.   The second time I decided to call the order in. Hello Z Pizza, can you hold? Can you hold some more? Hello can you hold? Unfortunately they don't wait for you to answer before putting you on hold, so you are SOL. I began the call when I was a 30 minute drive from the place and finished the call in their parking lot. I walk in expecting the place to be slammed, but no, it's dead. More employees than customers and guess what, they're chat, chat, chatting away - with each other.   This place would be great with an effective manager in place. Or maybe just any manager",

First off I called in a \"catering order\", specially stating the purpose of the order and how many guest would be attending. I had picked up a catering menu for the location to help make my decision. I ask the takeout staff for 8 catering sized pizzas and a catering salad. I confirmed with her that this would feed 20 people. All well and good. Day of the event the food arrives. The takeout employee hands me the food. I look in the bag a personal sized salad... This is a catering order. We also received and paid for XL pizzas, the menu clearly states large for catering (photo included). The employee left before I was able to discuss the issue so I called the store and spoke with the manager who was rude and offered little sympathy. They then redelivered the catering salad. When I went to meet the take out employee they handed me my salad and 4 completely open salad dressing. He did not mention or apologize for the issue or mess. I am so disappointed in the service and food and being over charged!! I will never be ordering again.",

    "text": "Z PIzza - wow you let me down!!  We eat zpizza somewhat regularly, Not my favorite but the wife likes it so if we are having pizza this usually it.  In phoenix for business, went to grab lunch at the 53 West Thomas location.  Service: the service was ok, a young man that was very eager to help us took our order quickly.  Order: I ordered the California salad, trying to eat light for lunch to combat the 118 day heat of the day. The order came out quickly and they called my name.  I picked up the food and after a quick glance..realized there must be a mistake. I think you gave me a side salad I mentioned to the manager. He looked at the salad and stated no that's the California salad. I mentioned the price as a question. \"This is 11 dollars?\"   His reply \"no, wait did you get a drink?\" Me \"yes\" Mgr \"then yes 11\"  The salad contained roughly 1.5 cups of mixed greens, 4 slices of cucumber, 1/4 of an avocado, 2 narrow slices of tomato and a few black olives. Easily contained in a side salad bowl.  I didn't want to make a big issue out of it, but I did advise him this seems like a very high price for a very small and plain food, and that zpizza may get the better end of the deal today, it would be my last visit.  BTW Mr. Manager - you probably shouldn't serve customers very small portions and then justify the price and the portions while holding your personal salad that looks like it would fill the grand canyon. You should treat your customers the same way you treat yourself.  My co-worked also felt the same way, to the point he had to pick up lunch two on the way back the office.",

Not sure what has happened there but the pizza is just not the same as before (see last review).  Issues are quality of pizza and price and my experience tonight solidified my less than stellar review.   Ordered to large pizzas: one Greek and one plain cheese, plus a salad for pick up. Total bill was about 45 bucks! Say what? Cough cough...holy cow!  Got home and low and behold, another feeling of my hard earned money being spent on less than average fare. Pizza dough was chewy and dry. It used to be amazing. Rest of pizza was bland and tasteless. It used to pop with flavor. See the theme here?   I just can't justify spending this kind of $$ on this quality of food. While pizza may not be the cheap alternative to feeding a family any longer, there are a dozen other places I'd rather go, spend half as much and get a pretty decent pie.  So long Z Pizza.",

Their (usually) perfectly crafted and aesthetically pleasing. The best thing about them is the variety. Its no longer cheese, pepperoni or sausage, they bring new elements to the table.      BUT, on the other hand, the one thing they are truly lacking in their business is genuine customer service and communication among themselves. About 2 months ago, I ordered two simple pizzas, the Thai (my personal favorite) and the ZBBQ (my boyfriends personal favorite). Because neither of us eat meat, I simply asked them for NO chicken. I have ordered from them many times, so I wasn't the least bit worried. I waited 45 minutes for it and when it arrived my pizzas were both covered in chicken, so we obviously couldn't eat them. I called and spoke with a manger just to say \"Hey, this kind of sucks!\" she then told me sorry and that I can have a free small pizza.  So, still being hungry I decided to place another order (why not?). 45 minutes later I receive the same order and even tipped the guy generously for having to come out again. Well, what to you know, there's no chicken! But wait, there's also nothing else on the pizza except cheese. Awesome.  Twice in one day on the same order. This has also happened several more times since.  For me, customer service is a big part of running a business. If you keep screwing up orders because you fail to communicate with your team you're going to lose valuable customers.",

He let his anger scare a young child 2) The owner should have spoken to me first. Never were my kids unsupervised, I was sitting right there. They were doing NOTHING wrong, just being energetic boys. Let me remind you: this is a pizza joint, not an upscale restaurant 3) Even after I told the owner to stop touching my child, he continued. UNACCEPTABLE. You do not yell at or assault a child. I would file criminal charges, but I don't want to put my kids through an ordeal. This man obviously has anger issues that need to be dealt with. My message to him: Stop picking on innocent little kids!  There is no PERHAPS, the owner absolutely should have spoken with me first. My child was shocked at the way he was spoken to and is still very upset by the event. The owner let his anger get the better of him. PERIOD. And for that he should apologize, not chastise",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this cute little pizza shop forever and we finally took the plunge last night. I grew up on Papa Johns and Pizza Hut living in a small town and while I love those too, I also like the fancier, more simple pizzas that come from Cibo and the like. I wasn't in the mood for the fancy types of pizza and Pomo doesn't deliver so we decided to give it a try. After looking at the menu, I was excited to see that it was organic and seemed like a fairly healthy choice when pizza typically can wreck a diet.   We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola salad (large), a small American pizza and a chicken sausage Rustica pizza. Ordering for delivery was quick over the phone and the total came to $30. That's a bit steep for delivery considering the regular chains have some incredible deals now but oh well, I decided it was worth the try! Estimated delivery time on a Sunday evening was 30-45 minutes.  I was pleased that the pizza's arrived much faster, probably closer to 20 minutes. The salad was large and for $8.50 it was pretty good. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was a bit sour but it complemented the salad pretty well. As for the pizza's, neither was that great. I had requested extra sauce and my first piece of American basically had all the toppings slide off when I grabbed the piece and the dough was undercooked. I thought because their crust is advertised as thin and crispy that it could have handled it but it didn't even come close. The overall flavor was decent but the presentation reminded me of something you get at a pizza buffet. It looked like a highly processed pizza to me and I know Papa Johns is way better if I'm going to go that kind of route. I had one piece of the chicken sausage pizza and did not like the sausage at all. It looked really processed in this weird oval shape and didn't like the flavor at all. Overall that pizza, minus the arugula (because since when is peppery lettuce so vogue?!?!) was pretty bland.   Sadly, we won't be ordering pizza from here again but I might swing by for the salad sometime. One star for the salad, one star for the fast delivery.",

Today I went to sit down at 4 different tables, having to continuously move due to the crumbs on each table. So, choosing the bar across from the cashier brought me closer to watching how they prepare the pizza. The guy wears no food handlers gloves! Just hands on cheese on my pizza! No thanks!

After eating here I highly doubt it, now my mom isnt the easier customer to deal with BUT i always talk right after her to clear up what she was saying and this guy wouldnt stop talking and just listen so he kept repeating exactly what I just told him. The pizza comes already made so they put it in the oven but we walked to the car and pulled away and it was still mostly cold, which made the pizza taste worse than it probably was but still it wasnt good. I got pepperoni and I ate it because I was hungry and as soon as I was done I became VERY sick to my stomach to the point I feel like i'm going to puke. My mom and brother both didnt enjoy theirs either. You won't catch me here again thats for sure!",

We really like that they use organic and non go ingredients in their offerings. That being said, I'm not sure I can continue to get pizza from here.   I've noticed over the last several months that the service and especially the attitudes of the employees is becoming worse and on occasion somewhat hostile. Tonight was the final straw for me. I was told my order would be ready for pickup between 20-60 minutes. When I arrived after 30 min, it was ready and the girl almost threw it to me across the register. I asked for the salad the id ordered as well and she looked at me as if I had three heads. Reluctantly she walked the three feet and got my salad too. The entire experience tonight put such a horrible taste in my mouth that I can no longer recommend Z Pizza to anyone!    EDIT:  Spoke with Brian, store manager, who recently took over this location. It seems like I got caught in some transitional pains. My wife and I will be going back soon and will update review at that time. Really appreciated Brian calling me and am looking forward to seeing the improved ZPizza!  EDIT2:  We went back last week. Night and day difference!!  Spoke with Keegan on the phone who was incredibly pleasant and friendly. When I arrived to pick up my order, the bearded man who makes pizza greeted me and was friendly too. He actually looked happy to be there. The young lady who was cashier that night was still standoffish at first but slowly warmed to polite conversation. Such an improvement.   Brian, you are doing a great job in turning this place around. I feel I can recommend your restaurant again.",

I was then told that they were making an exception for me because I was out of area that they deliver as if they were doing me a favor. Again I placed the order online.  When the food finally came another 20 min later (totaling an hour and 35 for what was quoted as a 45 min order) the food was burnt to a crisp Cold and hard.  There was nothing cheesy about the cheesy bread at all.  And when I immediately called the manager Brett said 20% off my next order. I spent $44 bucks on the worst food I've ever ordered with bad service like hell I'm ordering again. Woooow!! Definitely thumbs down!",

    "text": "I love this place and often stop by for the Tuesday upgrade special. Today I called in for pickup as I usually do and my order was confirmed over the phone. I get the same thing every time and they usually just use order history to confirm. When I went to pick up my order I noticed it was much smaller than normal after paying. The super nice guy at the register apologized and asked the guy making food in a hat and with glasses how long it would take to remake it correctly. He obviously heard him but completely ignored him. He asked again 2-3 more times and nothing. Finally the guy in hat and glasses (Jeremy maybe) grabbed the ticket out of the other guy's hand and just started making the pizza over again. I tried to interject and say I didn't have time to wait I just wanted the difference or a cookie or something. The guy at the register was again super nice and I apologized to him for having to deal with the other a-hole in the back. Not only did this guy mess up the order but was as rude as he could have been right in front of anyone viewing. He should be terminated and never be allowed to treat people that way or represent your establishment again",

The salads are great, and large portioned. It is pricey but I am willing to pay extra for what I think is good food.  Not 5 stars because lately when I order for delivery they have made quite a few mistakes.  Oh I almost forgot! They now have wings, and let me tell you, they are to die for! I ordered two different kinds of sauces and both orders just came with Ranch (doh!) but even without the sauces these were the best wings I have had in a really long time. I am personally not a fan of wings because they are usually overcooked or have a strange fatty consistency and these were just awesome. I would love to try them with some the offered sauces so hopefully next time I get what I order.",

Our guilty pleasure is ordering on Tuesday nights when it's buy one, get the second for $5 (or is it half-price?  some kind of great deal)....and eating pizza while we watch Biggest Loser.  I'm always a fan of pepperoni, and their crust is crispy thin...the best way.  Also like the Casablanca...artichoke hearts, mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella...so tasty.  Great to have Gluten-free crust as an option, and the ingredients are fresh.  Yes, it's a small west coast chain...but they do it \"right\".   Friendly staff, speedy service, easy location.",

Everything I've had here is great; I highly recommend the California salad, add chicken; balsamic dressing.  But every pizza I've had here is great too (a rotating selection), as is the Caesar.  I've also had a sandwich now and again and can't complain. Every once in a while the pizza has been sitting there a little while and is a little dry, but that's pretty rare, especially given the number of times I've eaten there. And hey, every 20 times you get a free pizza - can't beat that. (OK, 20 times seems a little high...)",

And, well, it was my time of the month. I'm in the biz so I wrote a constructive, non-cursing email. Not only did I hear back from the owner...turns out we hang in the same circle. So, last night I took advantage of a discount, ordered my za, spoke with a very cool, helpful manager and got the pizza of my dreams delivered. Along with some sweets from Pink Spot...see review below...pizza and ice cream sandwiches...DELIVERED...in Phoenix...merits and update, a shout out and when I win my Academy Award, I will mention you.

I did order wings and pizza (large) with traditional toppings and two beverages for $35 and paid upfront.  The wings were covered in sauce and turned out well done on the inside but somehow the skin was wet and soggy.  Gross.  The pizza was a thin crust which is good, but it too had lots of \"juice\" under the center of the pizza making it soggy and the juice looked like black water.  Gross.  A waste of $35!  A side note, the service was so poor from the cashier dude that thinks he should be given a tip before the food is even served.  He also made a verbal comment out loud that he was working for free.  I am sure zpizza has quality ingredients, but the wings made us both sick for the night which means another lost customer telling a hundred others not to visit this hole in the wall.",

BAD mistake since I am now addicted to this place.  I love their chicken and Yam Rustica pizza, for a change in pace.  Good place for the foodie in me, bad for the waistline. They have just opened a \"Pinkspot\" ice cream in the same store and the Tahitiian Coconut milk sorbet is outstanding! If coconut is not your thing they have A Kuaui Pie ice cream that is good too.I Don't understand the bad reviews.I am from Ny and pretty Picky about pizza and this place is pretty good for Phx standards. ( not Ny but who is in Phoenix?) Not everyone likes Good Ny pizza so that could be why some people did not like it. Also the rude service comments, really surprised me. I go here a lot and I am treated like family on every single occassion. I have never had bad service or bad pizza here, not once!  WOW! I wonder if the bad reviews are written by people who have vested interests in other pizza places? Sorry for their bad experience but if you Do like Ny pizza( not everyone does I agree)  you should  try it out. ( Probably not the Rustica, since that is not very Ny but get their slice special, which is a good deal. They have a 2 slice special and a 1 slice with a salad both with drinks and under 6 bucks!!!!!!!_ the only bad thing about the specials you have to have what they already have premade. Sometimes I like a choice but to have their pizza is a good trade off. Happy eating.",

In fact, a few steps down the street is another pizza joint which easily blows Z away.   I first had Z Pizza in Long Beach and I thought it was pretty good. That was in Long Beach. It just doesn't cut it against the many unique pizza bistros that litter the valley.   The pepperonis were a little flavorless. The sausage was decent, but nothing special. The crust was fine. The cheese and sauce were also nothing special. It's nice that there's a connected ice cream shop if you want to eat a bunch of cheese and bread and grease and then chase it with a bowl if sugar and cream.   To be honest - while I was eating it, I couldn't help but think that it was extremely overpriced. Right down the street was a better pizza place using better ingredients and costing less. I actually felt like I would rather be eating Peter Piper Pizza if that says anything.  The place was pretty clean even though it was busy. The staff was nice and friendly as well. It's not bad pizza at all - it's just nothing special.",

    "text": "I've had a love/hate relationship with zpizza since moving to the valley almost a year ago.  I like the idea of a healthier alternative to pizza and the salads are also delicious.  The combo with a slice, salad and drink is a great deal and I've eaten there many times for lunch or dinner.  I've always found the pizza to be OK...not great,  but just above mediocre and with the good price and great salad, I've found it to be a good option.  It's also nice that it's (usually) fast, so you can eat there in 30-40 minutes if you choose a pizza slice that's already prepared in the case by the front.  This was the driving force to my husband & I choosing to eat there recently.  We had an hour to get to a theatre show and needed dinner.  zpizza was on the way, so we decided to try it.  There wasn't a line to order and the dine-in area wasn't very crowded.  We both ordered the salad/slice combo.  While ordering, a 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 something else pizza was placed in the case.  I asked if the pepperoni slices were available (as they weren't on the sign) and the cashier said yes.  We both ordered pepperoni slices and paid and sat down to wait.  And wait we did....salads took a bit longer than usual and when they brought my husband's it was covered in dressing although he had specifically ordered it dry.  I think the guy expected him to be OK with it and eat it anyway, but he really doesn't like dressing.  He sent it back and had to wait again.  After finishing our salads, still NO PIZZA.  I went up to ask what was taking so long to heat up 2 slices, and was told that the pepperoni was not available so they were making a new pie.  I told them we picked it b/c it was already made and we were in a hurry, and they were now telling me 10 MORE minutes for the pepperoni.  I asked to switch our slices to the Napoli which was in the case, which they did.  They heated those up and served them with an apology, but a rather apathetic one.  Unfortunately, those slices didn't taste great, but we choked them down and ran out the door to be barely on time for the show.  I just don't understand why they couldn't have told me the slices in the case weren't available and that there would be a 25 minute wait.  At that point, we could've ordered a whole pizza or chosen a different place to eat.  Also, the employees all seem a little bit snobbish and don't seem to care a bit about customer service.  I think I'll be taking my pizza business elsewhere in the valley, which is unfortunate b/c zpizza is so close by.",

    "text": "This place really needs to be trashed more.  zpizza is a fraud in too many ways.  It markets itself as a sort of whole-foods, higher-end, indie urban culture-vulture sorta place.  It wants you to think it's a cut above.  And it's none of the above.  It's in reality a corporate franchise chain, with a few tweaks to its menu to make it look a touch Berkeley.  It's in a rather inaccessible part of north-of-downtown Phoenix, but they deliver.  The prices it charges for pizza are an outrage, their ordering system goes down too often, and they deliver a cold $25 pizza and then ignore you when you complain.    The ingredients it uses are largely not organic, but they want you to think they use high-end ingredients.  If the flat flavor of their pizzas is any indication, their ingredients come off the same Sysco truck any other middling restaurant's groceries do.    One time I tried to order online, the system choked.  I called and they said, \"We're sorry we're closed - our ordering system is completely down.\"  On a Saturday evening, they couldn't do business without computers.  Wow.    Another time, I ordered an American large, and discovered that they charge a lot extra for everything you add to your pizza.  And everything comes in the most paper-thin slices, so thin you almost can't taste it. I had never experienced see-through tomato slices before, and it was also my first encounter with windowpane pepperoni.  The crust is chewy, which is ok.  But there wasn't much food on my pizza.  It was thin and meager and not satisfying.  And it cost a lot of money.  Oh, and the sausage looked like perfect little weasel droppings, smooth and brown and perfectly formed, as if by machine - or by rodent.  They have whole-wheat crust and gluten-free crust and too many salads with stinky cheese in them and fruit too I think.  So if your probation officer said you have to eat more pear and gorgonzola gluten free pizzas with extra arugula, well, you can stay outta jail one more week.  Next time (why did I have a next time?) again, online ordering is down, but they take phone orders.  I am given a 30 to 40 min del'y window.  After 60 mins I call and ask.  Am told it's on the way now.  It arrives 20 mins after that.  I grab the box and it's cold.  I mention to young street-urchin-looking delivery hipster that my pizza appears cold.  I ask him to wait a sec while I open and check the pizza.  He bolts away and into his car before I can ascertain that I have a cold pizza and cold wings.  I wonder what the delivery guy was up to all that time?  My pizza had been baked some time before.  Perhaps he had been too.  While the slices were microwaving, I called zpizza to discuss and was told manager is unavailable.  Message is left for call back.  I also left a detailed accounting on their online form, and I never heard from anybody.    Again, people, this place tries to whore itself out as a high end, even crunchy place, the kind of place you'd take your lesbian-married-with-adopted-Chinese-baby friends, so you could look just a little less pathetically uncool than you really are.  But it is just another chain using smaller amounts of the same goods as everybody else, adding a few upscale salads to the menu, and charging 40% more than everybody else.  And they have unacceptably poor customer service.  Go to Pizza Hut.  Really.  Aim low and you won't be disappointed.  Oh - and Pino's next door has good and more authentic pizza too, but you gotta pick it up yourself.  Or if you can, get Rosati's - the real Chicago one.",

There is something about their sauce that I just don't like, and the pizza is always pretty greasy.

The lunch rush is a rush but you get in, you get out. And everyday is different, I can try all their different types of pizza. Personal faves: Sante Fe and Napoli pizza and the chicken pesto pasta.   While the pizza speaks for itself, I do have to give zPizza props for having the best specials.  Cheap daily specials, slice of pizza and a drink (or beer) for about $6, buy one get one for $5 on Tuesdays and of course, the frequent eater reward.   I like a place that offers great food and even more reason to come back.",

The last 3 times ( yeah...that's how much i eat there) have been not so great experiences. They have not been their pleasant selves over the phone. The lady who answers is almost always off put and the gentleman with the older sounding voice is not very helpful. How hard is it to take an order you ask? Well, apparently pretty difficult.   More customer service, less bad attitude I say. Don't treat me like a second class citizen over the phone. Just saying. Pizza Heaven for me from now on. Not to mention their delivery is VERY FAST. And the guy who answers the phone at Pizza Heaven actually seems to ENJOY his job :) What a concept   Ciao Zpizza. Our relationship is overrrrrr..  Although I must add, the delivery guys at Zpizza are super cool dudes",

Personally, I don't really like red sauce, so it's nice to find a pizza that doesn't have that as its main ingredient.

Even before my tweet, when I was at the Mayor's coffee event at the Heard Museum (yesterday), we received the Phoenix Passport Book.   My friend, Seth, told me that there was a coupon in the book and we should try it out.  There's no doubt that Z Pizza had to be a place I needed to try this weekend.  Instead of taking the Lightrail, we decided to drive.  (FYI, the closest Lightrail stop is Thomas and Central and it's only a short walk away.) We liked the friendly service and the comfortable atmosphere.  We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza and it was yummy.  We ordered the large because with the coupon, you get $5 off of a $20+ order.  The large pizza was $20.56.  We ate a few slices and took the rest home.    We sat and ate on their comfortable couch. Afterwards, the setting was so comfortable, we stayed and read our books.  I wanted to try the desserts at The Pink Spot, but I was too full.  All in all, Z Pizza had a nice atmosphere and good food.",

    "text": "I love mom and pop shops and especially when it's pizza! It made it even better that they have a vegan option! It is a pretty small establishment though; cozy, but I think I'd rather get my food to go each time because it would seem to be claustrophobic if there were at least 5-10 more people there. Located in midtown, so it's in a great location!   I went with my mom for lunch and it was surprisingly no one else in there (kinda had me skeptical) but I still wanted to try my first vegan pizza. I set my sights on getting ONE slice of pizza, but apparently they only offer the vegan slice if it is one of the pizzas of the day, otherwise you have to buy the whole pie. I was a little disappointed but my mind was set on the pizza so I just ordered the whole pie anyways, and not regretfully!  It took a little longer than expected to get our pizzas since we were the only ones in there but I guess you can't rush perfection right? My mom ordered a slice of the American pizza and a slice of the Bacon Spinach Mushroom pizza and I ordered the Berkeley Vegan pizza. All of the pizzas smelled really good! My pizza was so impressive, I feel like I could get used to vegan pizza and not miss cheese at all! Although the cheese is clearly not the same texture, it tastes more like a thick \"sauce\" than the hearty cheese that most know and love. Besides the cheese, all the other flavors were there and went well together! You could (almost) not taste the difference from a regular pizza. My mom really favored the Bacon Spinach Mushroom pizza with the white sauce and artichokes, she said both were good but that one was REALLY good.   I really enjoyed this place and wouldn't mind coming back again to order the vegan pizza, it will just take some getting used to the \"cheese\" texture! Customer service was great, they were helpful and I love when the staff makes suggestions. Although the cashier seemed a little new and took awhile to ring up our order, I appreciate everything the workers did to make it an enjoyable first visit.",

I figure while I do all the walking around and look for the restroom by then they already would have taken the order...but when I got back from restroom adventure it turns out that haven't even taken the order yet.

The Caesar salad looked super tasty.  The mushroom pizza was light and interesting.   We ordered the parm breadsticks and finished those rather quickly.

I could not stop eating the crust; it was a perfect balance of chewy and crispy.  I got the pepperoni pizza (boring, I know), but probably one of the best pepperoni pizza's I've had in a while. My sister got the Vegan Brooklyn, and she stated it's the best vegan pizza she ever had. I will definitely be back. Everyone is also very nice and willing to make recommendations.   Plus if you're new to the location, they are doing $5 dollars off if you dine in. I don't know the exact rules, so make sure to ask.   I also did not get pizza by the slice...

    "text": "I started going here after our son was born at St Joe's hospital a few doors down.  I like the atmosphere and that there are some more exotic pizza options on the menu than most other places.  Probably still not as healthy as a grilled chicken salad, but the ingredients lists make me think I'm eating healthy.    We order delivery now and then, and have always been well satisfied.  My only critique is I wish there were more specials and deals.    Yesterday our family received a soggy mess of a pizza that we ordered from a well known national chain located not far from Z's Thomas Rd location.  Maybe they're not a local Arizona business, but Z's is my pizza place of choice whenever there is a location close by!  Never again will we order from those other guys.",

    "text": "**FINAL UPDATE**12/11/14 I never received a reply from Brandi Babb. I would consider this closed after this much time. This company is horrible even at a corporate level.   10/23/14 I was able to make contact with the corporate offices of Zpizza. A woman named Brandi Babb sent me an email asking how she could help. I have detailed to her all of my updates and information about my experience and how little this location has done to make the situation right. I will post her response once I have received it.  UPDATE 10/18/14 I just received an email from the BBB advising they still have not received a response over a month later. BBB has closed the case and states this will have an \"adverse\" effect on ZPizza's rating. I was provided horrible service and even worse product and still, I was not refunded. Great job ZPizza. You've shown what type of business you really are.   UPDATE 10/10/14 I just got an email from the Better Business Bureau and they say ZPizza still has not responded to them. ZPizza also has not made an attempt at contacting me. BBB will give them more time to respond before closing the complaint.   UPDATE 09/17/14 I have filed my complaint with the Better Business Bureau today. I waited over a week for zpizza to call back and they didn't. I called them 09/16/14 and spoke with a nice girl named Harley who gave my information to the GM. The GM called me back on 09/17/14 and left a voicemail and didn't give his name. He defended what Sean, the manager in training, told me and said they won't refund me since I waited until the next day to file my complaint. He said \"this is the end game\" and declined my refund request. They've wasted more money responding to my complaints than the pizza is worth. Update coming soon....  UPDATE 09/10/14: I contacted corporate and they have forwarded an email to the owner resolve the issue within 48 hours.  UPDATE 09/09/14 ZPizza is making it impossible to get my refund. The manager, Sean, said, at the time of my call, that it's been \"almost 24 hours\" since I was there so they can't refund. I went to ZPizza right after work to submit my complaint. It had been maybe 17 to 18 hours. He says the sauce is organic so it evaporates into the cheese. He says the pizza was cooked even though it was cold and the vegetables were raw. I am waiting for his callback since he has to check with the owner to get approval for a refund. As a business owner, why hire a manager if you give them no power? They offered me a free pizza which I declined. I hate this place and don't want to eat there again. I want my money back. Next step is corporate and then the BBB.   -------ORIGINAL REVIEW-------  What a terrible experience. To order, it took the order taker at least 5 minutes because he didn't know the computer. He was dressed differently from all the other employees. I'm guessing he was a supervisor.   I specifically asked him if he would call our name when our order was ready. He said yes and said it'd be ready in 15 minutes. We waited 25. When I got tired of sitting around, I walked up to the register and the man seemed surprised and very quickly handed my order to me. It had been ready for an amount of time but we were never called.   Got home, cheese was rubbery. Ingredients were undercooked. Also, NO PIZZA SAUCE. What's wrong with these people? I put it in my oven for 10 minutes and it looked better. Taste was a 2 on a 10 scale. Again, no sauce. I would have gone back but, after waiting 20 minutes for my order, I was starving and didn't want to turn a simple pizza trip into a one hour ordeal. I posted some pictures of my pizza for the skeptics. I read good things about this place and am greatly disappointed. Over $20 for one large pizza and this is what I got?",

The manager working the counter was extremely rude and treated his employees terribly in front of me. Also, my pizza crust was charred, like black.

The peanut sauce lacked any yummy flavor, quite bland, & it was missing one of the toppings that it was supposed to have....no carrots. I complained up at the counter, & to compensate, they gave me a free drink. That was nice of them, but they should have told me up front, & not assume that I wouldn't realize that one of the toppings was missing, because I used to get the Thai Pizza all the time & I remember lots of carrots on it!  There was hardly any red onions or bean sprouts on it either!  However, there was a fair amount of chicken on it.  I will not be returning to z-pizza again.  FIRED PIE, here we come!~  Also, the chairs make a LOT of noise there when they're moved around...annoying!",

The order was wrong. Apparently they manually transfer the data from the online system into their ordering system and completely botched it.  We caught the driver before he left and he said he'd to back right away and the manager would call to tell us how they'd make it right.   Over an hour later, no call.   We called them and spent 20 minutes on the phone. We got no apology, just an excuse, \"We're so busy. We've got 30 people in line. All businesses make mistakes.\"  They offered to write down somewhere that we were owed a free pizza.  Seriously?! Like they'd proved their order system worked well enough for that.

So we called and ordered the exact same pizzas: one large SAUSAGE and mushroom and one large gluten-free pepperoni.  The girl on the phone informed us that gluten-free only comes medium. What?!?!?  Then she tells us that the order totals $4 dollars more than last week. ???  Then we start wondering, who was wrong? Was it the guy last week who allegedly gave us a large gluten-free that my husband loved and somehow didn't get sick from, and a onion and mushroom instead of a sausage and mushroom?  Or, the chick who seemed to be on the ball this week?  The order came rather quickly, which was nice.  My pizza was correct this time, and it was just as mediocre as the one last week but with the right ingredients.  The husband's pizza was indeed a medium and it only took one bite for him to realize that the pizza last week was NOT gluten-free.  This pizza had the crust that he anticipated last week, not good.  Not good to the point that he stopped eating the whole slice, pulled off the cheese and pepperoni and fed the crust to the dogs.  We are extremely pleased and incredibly surprised that the gluten-full pizza did not make him sick.  But, the pizza is dissappointing and not worth the $20 for a large pie.  At least now he has realized this, and we will not order from them again.",

She replied, \"I have to mop the floor, but we have a big party back there so you should be alright\".  I found this a very unpleasant way to begin our visit here.

Then, when the guy brought us our pizza, I had noticed a \"New Times, Best Pizza Winner\" sign, so I asked him if they had won this year.  He smugly said, \"Oh, I'm sure several years\".  I thought that was a crappy way to answer my question, since I am very familiar with these awards and didn't remeber them winning ever.  Apparently they one the reader's poll once back in 2007.

I tried a few other locs around town and it's whole different ball game. So take this from me that this is the solidified location.",

Maybe I've been spoiled by the Pear Gorganzola salad at the one on Tatum, but I wasn't pleased with my pizza/salad combo today at this one.   The garden salad was actually a lettuce salad with two tomatoes. It was weak. The pizza wasn't as organic tasting as I had hoped for. I was hoping for that fresh taste, but I got a Dominos taste. Disappointed. Maybe I should just stick to the Pear Gorganzola salad. Infact, I am craving that now!",

I've had their food many times, but solely via delivery to my place of business on multiple occasions.  The pizza offerings are fairly typical, but they do it right. Salads, pastas and sandwiches are also available. I ordered a tuna sandwich from them recently and I'm sad to report it was very disappointing. The bread was stale and the tuna was dry.   \"Well that's what you get for ordering a tuna sandwich at a pizza place!\" you might be saying. I wanted to see if they could pull it off. A for Effort is all I can say. I'd easily order their pizza again at the drop of a hat, though.  Someday I'd like to go in and see what Z Pizza looks like... dare to dream.",

If you don't like sweet, I can understand why you wouldn't like the pizza.  You can get about 4 different kinds of mushrooms on your pizza as well.  The topper is that you can get ricotta cheese on any pizza or calzone.  I personally always get a calzone with ricotta, mozzarella, black olives, portabella mushrooms, and italian sausage.  It is the most wonderful calzone ever.  The wife usually gets a pasta or a peperoni pizza.  She loves both.  The Thomas location also has an ice cream shop attached to it which is nice.  Usually the staff is knowledgeable and the cooks are consistent.  The Thomas location is also usually full of doctors or nurses which always makes for interesting conversation.",

As Lola M. mentioned, there aren't very many parking spots and the \"vegan\" cheeze here...might not be entirely vegan. Don't quote me on that though! The only selling points for me were the fact that it was close to my apartment, a friend of mine was the delivery guy, and it catered to those who had gluten and veg issues. My order: Gluten-free crust, Chipotle sauce, soy cheeze, mushrooms, basil, and avocado. It can get pretty pricey, but if you've got dietary woes, then you're probably used to paying a little more.",

    "text": "I considered giving Z Pizza one star but I thought I would be more generous than one of the staff members was to me.   In New Times there used to be a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  I saved my coupon as it did not have an expiration date.  One day I sauntered into Z Pizza and presented my coupon and ordered a soda to go along with the pizza.  I was told by the clerk that I could not use the coupon because \"too many homeless people\" were using the coupon and they no longer honor the coupon.  I am not homeless nor do I \"look\" homeless.  Instead I was told I could order a special that included two slices of pizza and a soda.  I won't ever forget the woman behind the counter who so coldly denied me my slice of pizza.  I promised myself that I would never return.  Few months later...  I thought to myself \"Self, you should really give Z Pizza another try.  Maybe it was just a bad day.\"  I called Z Pizza and asked for a delivery of a half soy and half regular cheese pizza.  In the past when I had ordered such a pizza, someone from Z Pizza was kind enough to mark which side was soy and which side was regular.  I thought the same would happen. I was wrong.  I received the pizza with no indication as to which side was soy and which side wasn't.  I called Z Pizza and asked about their soy cheese pizzas without telling them my predicament.  I was told \"Our soy cheese pizzas are so good you can't tell the difference between regular and soy cheese.\"  I proceeded to explain that in this case, I needed to know the difference and asked why it wasn't marked.  The woman on the phone asked \"How are we suppposed to do that?\"  I stated that in the past the soy side of the pizza was marked by a white piece of plastic that served as both to keep the pizza box from caving in on the pizza and it also served to indicate which side was soy.    I asked to speak with a manager after I realized I was getting nowhere with the woman on the phone.  She told me I would need to call the following day if I wanted to speak with someone in charge.  I then asked them to send me a small pizza with only soy cheese as a replacement at no charge.  I was told that they would call me back once they got the ok to make me another pizza.  They called me back and stated they would give me a small soy pizza but that it was on the bottom of their delivery list and insinuated that it was not a priority.  It took another hour for them to deliver the small, soy pizza.  Customer service at its finest?  I think not.  Not only did I have to think for them and offer my own form of compensation for their inadequacy but it was the second time that I had been treated in poor manner.    Save your money.   Come to think of it, I think I give Z Pizza just one star.  I will not bother ordering from Z Pizza ever again.",

In theory, I like that everything is organic but really I'm not that much of an organic snob so I could be over that soon too.   All in all, I'd say this place is good - not necessarily great.

The lighting is nice and ambiance is like an old country store. It is a pizza place, not the Ritz... so no frills, but lots of menu options.   Most people came, picked up pizza and left instead of dining in.   Zpizza has a pie for people like me called \"The Berkeley Vegan\" and I ordered a big one with triple vegan sausage.   The chef zealously zapped my zesty pie in the hot oven. It was covered in vegan cheese, sausage, and fresh veggies including zucchinis.   It emerged from the bake with the crust golden and perfect, and it was delicious.   It's a treat to eat a good vegan pizza! I really hope ZPizza sells many many of these and becomes zillionaires. Zya there sometime!",

The pizza is California style(not deep dish, not thin more regular crust) but what makes this place great is the quality and value for the price!!! I mean they really pile on the ingredients!!!

The marinara itself was delicious and you can add a copious amount of vegetables without the extra cost.   Do: cheat on your diet and get regular crust Don't: be \"healthy\" and get the wheat option  One thing to note is that this is your average pizza place.

But the 'ZBQ' was the choice for me: BBQ sauce, chicken w/ roasted red peppers, red onion, tomatoes, cilantro and sweet corn! Definitely a taste bud tantalizer, plus this joint threw in a generous handful of red pepper flakes and parmesan sans my request!  That right there is worth a little extra doe, via tip.  Also, they've got quite a few original topping combos too: curry chicken & yam w/ mango chutney.  That'll be my next pizza splurge!",

Originally, we'd set out for the dessert place next door, but I had just returned from a 10-hour day trip out to Grand Canyon and back so a slice of pizza sounded perfect...  The joint looks very collegiate and indie, full of simple designs, bright colors, and decisive lack of branding, although further inspection reveals it to be a widespread, though not yet prominent franchise.  For just shy of $20, I ordered three slices and drinks for our impromptu dinner, myself gravitating towards the simple pesto slice, as usual.  For the price per slice, it seems a tad on the expensive side, but the slice, its flavor and ingredients, is decent. The better option or deal is probably to get one of the heartier sounding whole pizzas [online menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweborder3.microworks.com%2Fzpizza%2FItem.aspx%3Fmenuid%3D2477%255D&s=fe4d5e0904deed0049b5bd3ac2a4d68f578c92154015bd2bbead2942330b44d6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">weborder3.microworks.com...</a>    Nonetheless, it hit the spot and service was very friendly.  There's a cool symbiosis of Z Pizza being immediately attached and sharing a space with Pink Spot next door. ___________________________________________ Savory and sweet in a single space!

We ate on the ice cream side, so I can't comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side.   Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food.  It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant .",

There are so many items on their menu I have not been disappointed with, from Pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad!! All of them tomato free.  The best feature though I have to say is their insanely easy to use online ordering. Being in the user experience industry, I'm frustrated with online ordering 95% of the time. Z makes me happy though. I actually sometimes miss them if I don't order occasionally. You can customize any item with almost anything you can think of and it's very easy to walk through. They also let you know up front if you are too far away for their delivery services so you don't sign up anyway.  I love you. I love you. I love you. And your use of fun ingredients like bacon and pine nuts and mushrooms :)",

After a long day of painting my new apartment I needed some grub, and looking for a place that delivers to my new digs downtown I came upon Z Pizza.    I have to admit, I was not pleased by the hour+ in between order and delivery.  When the guy finally arrived, he asked me if I traditionally had a problem with delivery people not being able to find my place.  God I hope not!  I can't imagine it's that tough!  He went on to tell me that he had just made a delivery to my building earlier in the day and couldn't find the right building.  Well it says the building name in big letters on the side. . .Figure it out, especially if you get lots of orders!  On to the pizza.  At $13 for a medium cheese and $17 for a medium \"Napoli\", this is definitely on the pricier side.  And is it me, or is the \"Italian Pizza\" just a bit redundant?  I was under the impression that pizza itself was Italian.  Anyway, the pizzas were actually really good.  i liked the fresh basil on the cheese pizza, and the roasted garlic sauce on the Napoli was fantastic.  I'm sure I'll be trying their other pizzas in due time.",

For lunch Z Pizza is a decent choice...the times I have been there service is quick and there is plenty of seating to be had. The parking lot is really small and fills up quickly, but don't let that deter you.  The first time I went for lunch I had the pasta with grilled chicken, pinenuts, and basil pesto. For the most part it was a good dish even though the pasta was a tad overcooked. It wasn't an overly large portion, but was the perfect amount for lunch.  I believe the pasta and a drink was close to $10.  I have also had the Moroccan pizza (pesto, feta cheese, pinenuts, and eggplant) which was very tasty although it could have used a bit more feta. For a slice of the Moroccan, a garden salad, and a drink, it was $8.  Some of my coworkers who I dine with also enjoy the calzone (you will have to wait about 10 minutes for it though) and the Santa Fe pizza.  I'm not really a fan of gourmet pizza, but for a lunch spot downtown it is not bad. It's not my first choice but not a place I drag my heels to go to either. The one good thing about this Z Pizza location is that they will deliver at night to the State Capitol which we had them do once this fall when we were working late.",

It was $50-something for one XL pepp pizza, one L pepp + sausage pizza, 3 bottles of water, and one beer. We all felt that was a bit much, but it was very good pizza.   I also liked that the next door ice cream place was connected to the restaurant by a breezeway. It made it feel more like a community place. I recommend the place for pizza.",

They are next to the Pink Spot and they have free WI-FI.  It's a great place where it feels like you know everyone even though you're just there.  They also deliver in downtown phoenix, so it's great for me..  Bottom Line:  Comfortable. Comfort food, comfortable people, and a comfortable layout. Everything I need is right there.",

Honestly what I am a big fan of at zPizza is their sandwiches and salads. They're flavorful, fresh, and the bread is awesome. The salads have interesting combinations and are a nice size.

    "text": "I'm all-in with any place that touts organic ingredients, so I wanted to give this place a whirl. After two visits, I'm just inclined to say \"It's all right, I guess.\"  The pizza is more impressive than typical chain pizzas, of course, but both pizzas I tried (first being some Greek pizza and the second a masterpiece of my chosen ingredients) were pretty salty and greasy. I'm a fan of thicker-crust pizzas, Chicago-style and the like, so I wasn't super pleased with these more thin-skinned slices; but if you like that kinda thing..  Customer service here could also use work; it's not absolutely horrible, but both times I went the service lady (two different ones) gave the impression that I was holding her up or something. The second one, who I told we were going to be a second in deciding on our pizzas, said \"okay\" and stood and stared at us as we uncomfortably perused the menu. Better than disappearing, I guess, but still kind of jarring. The whole staff seems kind of \"irreverent hipstery,\" and I can't stress that vibe of \"We have something better to do\" more.  The ingredients seem pretty good, though, and there are plenty to choose from for you out there who enjoy a slew of exotic flavors on your pie. I'd recommend it over most pizza places, just say to order carry-out online so you don't have to deal much with customer service and to shy away from any oil-based sauce (pesto/olive oil whatever) so you won't have an oil rag for a slice of pizza.",

My order shows up as I am on the phone. The man on the phone asks if I can give my phone to the driver. The driver was rude as well but was instructed to give me half off my $25 single pizza. I appreciated the attempt and felt bad at sending him away as he was already here. I paid (as well as tipped the driver) and he rolled his eyes and walked away. I open the box to find not only was my half onion have olive pizza incorrect but it was cold, hard, and tasteless.

I had one issue with a mis-marked pizza out of their display case recentlyof \"by the slice\": it was chicken barbecue which I cannot eat (I HATE chicken barbecue pizza) but the sign said \"Neapolitan\" too late as I had already taken it home.   I went in (May 20th) for a birthday lunch, and was disappointed in the experience. Me and my sister were enjoying our pizzas and one of the staff, seated a full two tables away watching television in the dining area- for some reason was listening in to our conversation! then joined in of his own accord. We politely replied with small talk and went on speaking more quietly to ourselves, which he then later again opined on of our comments which were not of his concern. It was very awkward being forced to entertain a person that I hadn't planned on speaking with. I am sure he thought he was being \"friendly\" but most paying customers do not appreciate the staff interrupting the customer and joining in their conversations.   The cashier also refused to enter in my phone number which gives the customer a free large pizza when they've spent a certain amount there. I wonder if he input someone elses number?   All of the staff seem to have tattoos all over the place- their arms, legs, what have you. Tattoos aren't cool anymore but I guess they are permanently stuck wearing them.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I stopped by for lunch in-between classes to grab a slice of pizza. We'd been to Z Pizza once before and it was pretty good.  Apparently they had just opened because they had no slices out, and they told us it would be 10 minutes before it was ready. Technically they opened early, a little less than 10 minutes, so I think they were on time with preparation for the most part. The manager made sure to let us know they always try to open early for our benefit.   We browsed the local art (all 'abstract') on the walls, looked at the shop connected which had ice cream, interesting treats, and breakfast/lunch foods, but we ended up waiting for the pizza because we wanted something real and tasty (and less than $4-5 for one item).   One slice of pizza came out to about $3, which I expected since they are smaller and more specialty. The thing that made me happy was that it was a decently sized slice for both of us to share. It was the American, which was awesome. Fresh ingredients, bright colors, REAL thin crust (nice and crispy, yummy even plain), and not as much of a greasy feeling that is usually found in other pizzas that are loaded with too much cheese or whatever.   There was a little bit of a water/grease mixture that dripped off in the first handling, but that is just because of the fresh veggies and meat and cheese. If your meat and cheese doesn't have a drop of grease when cooked, something isn't right. This was in no way soggy or dense with grease. It was really a perfect slice of pizza to be honest.  The only thing that made me worried was a common nat or two flying around. With ingredients that are mixed and prepped on the open-aired counter-tops, that is a worry for me. It's not something very controllable by the employees or store hygiene, so I don't lose customer satisfaction, but I wonder if they ever get baked into the mix every 10,000th pizza. The irony is that there was one in the menu viewing box at the entry. I will stress that the place practices cleanly standards from what I observed.  All in all I know I am a satisfied customer when I don't regret spending my money and time and energy into going somewhere, which happens often. Z Pizza has a nice local, casual feel, not as concerned about a fake approach to you when you are there, and hey, they even warned us that the slice was really hot. It's about the quality of the food/time without being ripped off, and the food quality was really awesome! My fiancee and I would probably come here again for a close-by solution for hunger when we are waiting for our next class.  *If you want a more cafe atmosphere, the location on Central is good for that. They have live music near the outdoor seating weekly as far as I know, usually kind of jazzy.  P.S. Thumbs up for having same-priced gluten free options for pizza!",

The upside: Good veggie/vegan options. - You can opt for the whole wheat crust for no extra charge (the gluten-free crust is a $3-4 upcharge).  -Their California Veggie and Moroccan eggplant pesto pizza are divine.  -There's an ice cream parlor next door. - Their iced tea isn't awful.  The downside:  THE SERVICE. - We always order and pick up -- and are consistently on hold for more than 5 minutes, often times having to call back because they hung up.  - There are a few people working at this location who clearly hate their jobs. Their attitude and manner is really unpleasant to be around. I get it, you work at a pizza place and you're not that happy... but WHY take it out on the customers?   I came in the other night and watched a guy stand in line in front of me for about 8 minutes (he was already there when I arrived), while the girl at the front was on the phone. There's another register.. yet no one came up to help him. He ordered slices and by the time I told them what I was picking up, added a slice and got my drinks, he was STILL waiting. This poor guy waited 20 minutes just to get 2 slices of pizza that was already premade and in the case! That's just careless service.",

The staff is really unprofessional, had awkward \"night out\" stories that they were loudly telling in front of customers. I had to walk up to the counter and wait to get a box, as I was being seemingly ignored, but one of the employees was eager to help me once he noticed me.  It is conveniently placed near/connected to a dessert/cafe that looks cute, too, but I did not try it.   This place might be better for take-out or delivery, but I'm not sure.

Happily, I don't special order anything - and my last couple orders have been the pear and gorgonzola rustica pizza. It's tasty. It's fresh, and it's filling. I think it's overpriced for what it is, but we don't have that many decent delivery options, so I'll deal with it.  I attempted the hummus once. Small portion, way too runny and completely lacking in flavor.  The special orders seem to be an issue. A coworker ordered the turkey sandwich and asked them to hold the tomato. That apparently was translated to hold the cranberry sauce, too. Pity - she really likes the cran. In fact - anytime any of us have asked for any \"special\" handling of our meals, there has been an error.  So - I'll stick with my pear and gorgonzola when the decision to order Z Pizza is made - and hope it continues to be A-OK.",

    "text": "First, let me say, when it comes to Pizza, Z is probably the best in Phoenix.  Second, their service is terrible.  We have been going there for quite some time and they have gotten worse and worse. If you put in a n online order good luck on getting what you requested. They are all baked and can't read an online order to save their lives.   When you call to complain there are never any managers there so they don't give a shit.  Great pizza, terrible service.",

I really enjoy eating there as well because of all of the options they have available. From vegan pizza to sub sandwiches, whatever you may be in the mood for, they've got it.   I'm actually on a personal mission to find the best pizza place in town and so far, Z Pizza is at the top of my list.",

    "text": "I tried a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese from zpizza on Sunday. It was just ok. Pretty dry as there was not much sauce under the cheese and extra cheese didn't quite reach the real extra cheese level to me. If my pizza was extra cheese, I'd hate to see what a regular amount of cheese would be. My last bite seemed to have all the sauce I wished would have been in each bite. At $18.95 (including tax) for a one item with extra cheese thin crust 14\"  pizza, definitely not worth the price despite all the organic claims on the box. However, as organic goes, this wasn't bad by any means. Service was good, they quoted me 15-20 minutes and the pizza was hot and ready when I arrived. The price alone will prevent me from coming back.",

    "text": "Over a week for horrible customer service...  Customer since 2007, not anymore  I basically wrote them off after talking my dad and family into ordering from them one night instead of Papa John's.  Fresh ingredients and real food right?  But after they delivered it, the pizza I ordered for dad was soggy and undercooked.  (which is alway the worst when you build a place up, finally get others to try it, and get burned!)  2 weeks ago for Father's Day, I was spending time with my dad and asked him what he wanted to do for dinner, he asked for Z's.  I tried to persuade elsewhere, but he just wanted to relax at home.  So I called up and placed an order, then ran to pick it up.  When I left with it, they forgot to put the 2 slices of pizza in the bag (I looked in it and thought everything was there)  Get home, realize they are missing so give them a call.  me-\"Hey this is Steve, I was just there, you guys forgot my 2 slices of pizza\"  \"ya, they are sitting right here\"  .....  .....  me- \"okkkkkk, well what do you guys do in situations like this....\"  \"they are sitting right here\"  .............  me- \" Ok....well we just sat down to eat, and I'm not running back up there right now, so in situations like this, what do you guys do to make this right, have the delivery driver drop them off or just refund me for them?\"  \"I will add a 5 dollar credit to your account that you can use next time\"  me- \"uhhh I think the 2 pieces cost more than 5 bucks, so can you just refund my card back the right amount\"  At this point I was already DONE with this place, who forgets food then doesn't offer to make it right, THEN lowballs you on a credit?? If you are going to offer me a different amount, At LEAST offer me MORE than what I paid for not LESS!  INSANE  \"ok I just did the refund\"  me- \"thanks man\"  that's it, no apology, nothing. He also sounded like he wasn't on point, and after the way he handled it AND originally forgetting my food I was worried about the refund.  I kept an eye on my credit card account, and 3 business days later, still no refund, so I called back up to find out whats going on.  He never did it.  Wednesday:  after 20 mins on the phone, I am told that the owner will have to call me back to investigate this and issue a refund. Odd that NO ONE there can handle this or refund my money  Friday:  Still no refund and no call from the owner, so I call AGAIN and explain it all over for the 2nd time. I was told the owner would have to call me and let me know.  later that day he does, is nice on the phone, says sorry, and that he can't refund me back on my credit card, that I will have to swing by to pick up the refund  once he is done, I explain how disappointed I am and how I waited almost 1 week and had to call 3 times for a refund, after not getting my food, getting a lowball credit offer, and being told I would get a refund and NOT, and that I now have to drive back up there to collect my refund. He has nothing to add but \"sorry\" and he is \"trying to make things better there because there has been some customer service problems\"  ------  Well earlier tonight I was riding by, so decided I would grab it (a tank of gas in my bike) so went in and asked for it  open up the envelope, thinking mmmmmmaybe they will throw something in there, like a free pizza coupon to make it right, but nope  6 bucks and 1 penny  If they had thrown a coupon in, I was already mentally ready to ask for the manager and give it back. I don't want their food, or anything FREE, and that it's the principle.   and I thought it would be BOSS to do, give it back :D  but would had scored points in my book for the effort  but NOPE  all of that, calling them 3 times, all just so I can drive back up there to get my money back  so heads up  this is how they treat customers who have gone there for years, who's orders get forgotten, and takes them almost a week just to give a refund  as a business owner, and former manager in the food industry, that isn't how you take care of your customers  such a shame, love supporting local businesses and had recommended them to quite a few people before  so if you are thinking about hitting this one, I HIGHLY recommend you look east, 2 buildings over, Pino's- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/pinos-pizza-al-centro-phoenix\">yelp.com/biz/pinos-pizza...</a> , and try them out  AMAZING customer service, friendly, helpful, and waaaaay better food  seriously, you can see I gave them a 5 star almost 1 year ago, that's where I've been going for pizza since",
